0,2018-07-01,2018,7,1,10,8v6iby,Let's settle this once and all--is YG the monster many say he is?,Wolf_Puppy,1530407859,"Let's settle this YG thing once and for all. Is he the monster many say he is, or are people being too biased in their views?

Okay, I've been wanting to post this for a long time now, but I didn't because I know it would likely turn into a shit show. But given how Reddit in general is a much more mature and intelligent community than just about all the other K-Pop communities I can think of (due to strict rules on conduct and meaningful posts), perhaps it is possible to settle this once and for all (or at least in this community). 

Let's go through each of the points that are always raised when ever YG's name comes up, and we'll discuss each point, and then maybe at the end reach some kind of consensus about YG. If you're going to comment, then directly address these points by their number (or add new ones I didn't cover and numerate them). 

	1) He puts his artists in the YG dungeon and doesn't give them enough comebacks or promotions, or even just support them.

Do we really know if he's the one making those decisions? He's not even the CEO of YG, and the company does have its marketing department, so why should all the blame fall on him? Also, it seems Teddy is shouldering so much of the songwriting/producing responsibilities at YG, so when you depend on one guy that much, what happens when he has writer's block and can't come up with anything that everyone at YG is happy with? Could that be part of the reason for delays? What about the artists themselves dealing with anxiety, depression, etc., that might throw a wrench into their plans? What if YG has its own business plan that they can't disclose to the public?  Is all of this YG's fault, or is it the fault of the company, not the man? Also, we're not flies on the wall inside of YGE, so we don't know the relationship between the artists and YG or the company staff. There could be inner-company politics going on that we are unaware of. 

	2) He called 2NE1 ugly.

Anyone who understands S. Korean culture knows that they have very different mentality when it comes to telling people negative things to their faces. Friends and relatives and co-workers might say to your face things like, ""Damn, you look terrible--all swollen and haggard,"" or ""You need to lose some weight--you're getting fat,"" or ""You should try to dress better since you're ugly compared to most other girls, and you need every advantage you can get."" YG is not unique in how blunt he is when he gives negative feedback to his artists on their looks--that is just how the culture is. (Chinese culture is similar in that way, and being Chinese, I can totally understand that cultural difference. I don't agree with it, but I understand it.)

	3) He's a predator who ""groomed"" Eun-Ju to become his wife, and purposed made her group fail so he could marry her.

I have to call bullshit on this one, because when people talk about this point, they are always completely biased and never even try to put themselves in YG's shoes, and instead try their hardest to make him sound like some kind of disgusting, calculating psychopath. How about putting yourself in his shoes for a moment and consider what he went through? 

When YG realized he had fallen in love with Eun-Ju, he felt very conflicted and he struggled for a very long time over whether he should tell her how he feels. If he was a predator, he wouldn't have struggled with it. He was obviously worried how she might feel about a company's owner confessing his feelings, since that imbalance of power would put pressure on her. Also, she's 12 years his junior, and he worried if she could even love someone so much older than her. And if she rejects him, it would make things very awkward between them since she's signed to his company and they still have to interact on a professional level. Put yourself in those shoes for a moment and imagine how conflicted you'd feel, and whether you'd have the courage to confess your feelings to the woman you love, while preparing yourself emotionally for the worst-case outcome. 

So he called her up and confessed and talked for a long time, because obviously he's worried about how she feels and whether he's putting unfair pressure on her to accept him because he's YGE's owner. No man wants to feel like the only reason the woman he loves with all his heart would give him the time of the day is because of the position he holds in a company -- everyone wants to feel loved for who they are as a person. So of course he would be very careful to make sure if she were to accept him, it would be because the feeling's mutual, not because he's her boss. 

As for Swi.T not doing well and disbanding, YG had said on a TV show once that the group itself had problems and lacked in some areas, and he felt conflicted whether to pour more resources into the group and getting them up to speed, or to just accept how things are and not do more, because he feared if he really pushed for the group to become successful, their success would alter things too much with Eun-Ju, and he decided to not give the group more attention that's needed to make them more successful. Now, this is the one point where YG was clearly being selfish, but that's not the same thing as going out of his way to sabotage the group as many claim--he simply didn't try harder with the group as he could have. Also, consider the fact that for most human beings who love another person dearly, we would likely kill to protect that person or would even be willing to die for that person, so YG not paying the group more attention is hardly some kind of unforgivable crime, considering it was for the love of his life. He said he felt bad about not having done more to make Swi.T more successful, but let's not exaggerate and say he purposely sabotaged the group. 

Consider the fact that they are happily married with two children. Unless Eun-Ju is miserable and abused by YG, everyone needs to just give it a rest and be happy for them. 

	4) He was a jerk on MixNine and said some very harsh things to the contestants. 

He admitted he was trying to create more drama so the show would be more exciting, and that is not how he usually is. If didn't work and backfired, so later in the show he stopped with that schtick and went back to his usual self, which is much nicer. If any of you have ever watched any of the six seasons of K-Pop Star, you'll know that YG was often the kindest, most encouraging, most supportive, and most lenient on that show. He made JYP look like a total jerk in comparison. He often saved contestants from being eliminated by using his one special card (each judge is allowed one), because he wanted to give the contestant another chance. He did this more often than any other judge (JYP, BoA, You Hee-Yeul). He did K-Pop Star for six seasons and was so kind and supportive on that show (and signed many of the contestants to YG), yet nobody ever talks about that. 

	5) He gawks and leers at cute female trainees on shows. 

Have you all seen how JYP and You Hee-Yeol also gawk at the female trainess/idols on K-Pop star when they do sexy concepts? Why are you singling out YG? Also, judges on shows are playing it up for the camera--it's for entertainment. You're supposed to have big reactions about everything on those shows. Idols are taught that during their training--to react big on variety shows and reality shows, and this goes the same for all entertainers. The whole point of having female trainees do those sexy concepts is to get a big reaction out of the judges and audience, and if they couldn't get a big reaction, they've failed.

	6) He's a predator pedophile.

WTF? Based on all the above, how the hell is YG a pedophile? That is just ridiculous and basically slander. Also, he obviously adores his daughter from everything we've seen about them in the media, and to call a loving father a pedophile is just disgusting. This is not a term to be used lightly just to paint someone in a bad light--it's no different than calling an innocent person a rapist just to destroy his life. It is wrong. 

And finally, I just want to say that YG is a human being with feelings like the rest of us. People too often forget that and say the most horrible things in comments about celebrities and then lament why these celebrities would suffer from anxiety, depression, or commit suicide. You think maybe it has something to do with the vile things haters throw at them constantly? Sure, YG's no angel--he's flawed like the rest of us, but he's certainly not the monster people claim he is. 

Whether you agree with disagree with the above points, lets have a civilized and clam discussion, so we can finally reach some kind of consensus about YG. ",99,0

We have been doing monthly Town Halls for almost two years now and they are great ways to interact with you guys and get feedback for the subreddit.  However, we feel like doing it every month is a bit overwhelming.  The Town Hall stays up for a week, then if a follow-up post is required the following week, we're already half-way through the month and it's almost time to go again.  In order to bring you guys better Town Halls and not feel like we're constantly trying to change the rules, we've decided to move Town Halls to a quarterly schedule.

We have updated the [Town Hall archive page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/townhall) to include a schedule of future Town Halls so that you'll know when the next one will occur.  The next Town Hall will take place on September 1st, 2018.  Remember, that you can bring issues to the mod team any day by [sending us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop)  We always do our best to answer all modmail thoughtfully and thoroughly, so please feel free to drop us a line if you think there areas we can improve the subreddit and don't want to wait for the next Town Hall.

#### 2018 Annual Census

It's that time of year again.  We'd like to start the 2018 Census on August 1st, so now is a good opportunity to reflect on last year's census.  Please review [last year's results](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7acjc8/reddit_kpop_census_results_2017/) and let us know if you have ideas on ways that it can be improved.  Are there any questions that should be added or changed?  Are the response choices adequate?  Last year, some users expressed interest in having a ""South Asian"" ethnicity choice, and it seems we sort of forgot about Central America and the Caribbean in the location question.  Is there anything else you feel we left out last year?  We will do our best to update the lists of groups and soloists with everyone who debuted in the last year (*hello (G)I-dle*).  What other areas of the census can be improved?  Let us know what you think in the comments below.",78,79

Even though it's an obvious pick, the song of 2018 for me so far is Momoland's BBoom BBoom.  I love seeing nugu group that's been struggling catch lightning in a bottle and rise up the charts.  I can honestly say that I've been a fan since their debut and have enjoyed all their songs, but this one is on a whole other level.  I remember the first time I watched the MV and thinking ""Wow!  This like really really good, right?""  BBoom BBoom is such an infectious song, it was stuck in my head after the first listen.  The choreo and styling were also great.  The suits!

Im going to be inspired by great Spotlight posts like [Stray Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7p2ssr/spotlight_stray_kids/), [Pristin](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6u2d7a/spotlight_pristin/) and [AOA](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/76octc/spotlight_aoa/), but focus more on why I personally decided to spend by time stanning them when I already have fifty other groups to juggle. Yall can google training periods, vlives and blood types by yourself, I trust you. 

I will however be giving you a brief idea of what they did on Broduce since its such an integral (and easily accessible, if one wishes to watch it) part and not all of us put ourselves through the pleasure of watching it and still get flashbacks whenever sad nayana piano music comes on. 

So youre getting that plus five videos Id recommend you watch. None of us have time to wade through 10379 links. Any links within the text will just be short clips referencing whatever I brought up, gotta cite my sources and all that. If you want more after that, check the comments below (which tbh might take a hot minute to put together, bear with me pls) Also shout out to u/kaktusgedanken for giving me the idea and recommending Id write it up as a Spotlight, youre the best!

# + The Basics 

**Name**: Nuest/ which stands for New Establish Style Tempo. Yeah. The W in Nuest W stands for Waiting, which most often gets brought up in the context of Waiting for Minhyun (more on that in a second) 

**Nicknames**: Youll see Nuble around a lot, but just for Nuest W. They also get called reversal icons quite a bit. 

**Members**: 5 - Aron, JR, Baekho, Minhyun, Ren

**Debut Date:** March 15, 2012. So theyre seniors to the likes of EXO, BTS, VIXX and also BTOB by a solid 6 days. They were all children though since apart from Aron theyre all 95 liners. Their debut song is [Face,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyXy0m-4bvE) where you can play spot the baby Seventeen members

**Company**: Pledis, so label mates to [After School](https://youtu.be/1ETZ7Sd74wU) (idk about you but I love me some cringey cute collab stages), [Seventeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBgkIWV13MI), [Pristin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpQaH3ipvk), etc

**Fandom Name**: Loves or L.O.V.E. or L.O..E or well, technically , taken from their Hangul name if you basically strike out all the vowels. And the fandom colours are Deep Teal and Vivid Pink, which gives you really [pretty pink oceans](https://twitter.com/BeenziMino/status/901839800176525312)

Theyve overall released two studio albums (one Japanese, one Korean), 5 Korean mini albums/EPs as Nuest, a Korean compilation album and two minis as Nuest W.   


# + tl;dr History

Just so no ones confused and we have a basic understanding heres a quick tl;dr: after their debut Nuest went through **concept changes** (which technically also brought us [Sleep Talkingsus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UyMeMyJ2yg), so I cant even be mad in that regard), got shipped off to China to form Nuest M with a sixth member (hi Jason wherever you are these days) and then Japan, lost basically their entire already small fanbase so when they made their Korean comeback in 2016 with Q is. and Canvas you had whopping first week sales of like, 900 copies. 

Four of the five went on **Produce 101 Season 2**, everyone felt cheated to hell when JR didnt make the final group, Minhyun however did and is now promoting with Wanna One and Nuest made their comeback as the subunit **Nuest W** which thankfully is seeing great success last year and with their current comeback too. 

This is obviously all very sad, but Im not here to try and guilt you into stanning them for their \~tragic history. 99&amp;#37; of k-pop groups never get the chance to actually change their direction and get the opportunities and success that Nuest is getting now. If you want to stan them it should be, imho, for who and what they are as a band and not their career history. And tbh I dont feel like going look how bad they had it! look how sad they were! has ever gotten me personally invested in someone, that impacts me after I get to know them. If you however are interested in a more concrete and detailed history, fret not, [I got you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MMrm12iY04).

# + Members

Now to the core of this entire mess. Im going to give you some basic facts as well as personality traits that stand out to me and endear them to me. If any Nuest fans are around and want to add their own opinion on this, please do! This is obviously very subjective.   
**++** [**Kim Jonghyun/JR**](https://twitter.com/__Lovepaint/status/1012129359140802561) **(or Junior Royal since Pledis hates me)**

**Birthday****:** June 8th, 1995  
**Nicknames**: National/Nations Leader, Onibugi (Wartortle), Agumon, members call him J-ah apparently   
**Positions**: Leader, Main Rapper, Main Dancer  
**Social Media**: [@pockyjr](https://www.instagram.com/pockyjr/?hl=en) on instagram

Jonghyun was the first ever male trainee at Pledis, [entering the company together with After Schools Lizzy &amp; Raina](https://youtu.be/XSffk3mGg4A). 

For his recent birthday he dressed up in a Squirtle costume (idk, Wartortle was sold out??) and [went around viewing his birthday ads.](https://twitter.com/nuestsjr/status/1004822868486705152) I know. 

He was a regular member on Night Goblin with formerly Weekly Idols/Idol Rooms Doni!   
**During Produce 101 S2:**   
So, all of Nuest kinda didn't do too hot during their initial evaluation and also their re-evaluation. Call it stress or pressure or god knows what, [the only one who managed to hold it together was JR ](https://youtu.be/Qc4ekPCPxJY)who went up from D to B. The rest isnt pretty to watch, Im ngl. The real fun started after that with the performances, where they got to shine.   
Jonghyun was chosen by Minhyun for his Sorry Sorry Team 2 (more on that in his section) where one handy [little MNet section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w60-p5jf8Vs&amp;feature=youtu.be) quickly got him the title Angel Leader or National Leader. That went through the show with a[ great performance during the position evaluation](https://youtu.be/fKnGWHtuJ0Q?t=1m10s) that had me at home re-enacting Baekhos wobbly lip and Kahis teary eyes since his lyrics are brutally honest in showing his mental state at that time. And fun fact: he cried after the performance since he got first place but made a mistake during the chorus so he thought he didnt deserve it. This guy. 

His performances after that were [Never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmbMEZq8tIg) and the criminally underrated [Super Hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PxlB37_bc). However, he eventually came in 14th in the finale which was pretty darn shocking since he actually had the top spot during two of the voting periods. Im not lying when I say that that upset pretty much coloured the entire voting night, I greatly encourage you to head over to r/Broduce101 and check the posts from back then. We all felt a bit like [Hyunbin](https://login.uni-hannover.de/ui/services.). But well it just wasnt meant to be, and it did bring us the Nuest W (which another funfact: Pledis didnt even have a plan for them post!101.)  
But this brings us to: 

**About:**  
Dude's so fucking **selfless**. He had to lead a group at such a young age, deal with them not being successful and constantly puts the blame on himself for anything (which he shouldn't, just to be clear). For a good example of how he sees himself as a leader watch the letter video I link below. As I pointed out, he's the main rapper AND main dancer, but rarely ever pushes himself into the spotlight. I mean he had a hot 3 seconds of screen time during Never.   
They were in such a difficult position during Produce and he somehow managed to get himself together and use his energy to help both his own band and the other trainees succeed, and I really admire that. And he does the same in his own band. 

But he can also be really funny and cute and upbeat?? Hes painfully shy, which leads to a lot of cute interactions, but once hes out of his shell hes such a goober? The duality of men, I tell you. 

**++** [**Kwak Aaron/Aron** ](https://twitter.com/Moonlit_Aron/status/1011931913580249088)(i hope y'all appreciate my picture selection)

**Birthday**: May 21st, 1993 (eldest, but sure doesnt act like it)  
**Nicknames**: Aje-ron, Maknae-Hyung  
**Positions**: Rapper &amp; Vocalist, though he does more vocals these days  
**Social Media**: [@nuestaron](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjsOidElFs-/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=nuestaron) on instagram, nr. 1 source for cute dog pictures 

Aron was actually the last member to enter Pledis and basically didnt know any Korean when he got here (hes from LA). Him and Pristins Sungyeon[ actually lived in the same apartment building](https://youtu.be/UP-0gqYIORc?t=6m41s), and his sister is friends with her.   
He hosted a radio show for over 2 years, and while some clips float around a lot of them are lost to the annals of time. 

He wasnt on P101, he auditioned but didnt get through. So instead he spent the time waiting at the dorms for the boys to get back and hug them (Im just quoting here) and also spent some time in LA with his family. He did go and [watch their final P101 concert though](https://twitter.com/jetaimedongho/status/881414685546774529)!

**About:**  
Aron often gets overlooked. He's a rapper, but not the main rapper like JR. He does vocals, but not as 'great' as Baekho or Minhyun. He's charismatic, but not as charismatic as Ren is. But honestly, I think he's the **backbone** of this entire operation and just 100&amp;#37; dedicated. He had to be super **adaptable**? I mean he went from mainly rapping in English to covering a bunch of vocal parts that he never had to before when Minhyun left (same goes for Minki, too)?? A glow up, I tell you. Also I personally really like his voice, idk.   
I also wish they'd do a bit more of an upbeat concept since he's just super charming when they can let loose and be a bit more smiley on stage. He's also very much in love with his members, imho. When you hear him talk about the relationship they have it's just very endearing??  


**++**[**Kang Dongho/Baekho**](https://twitter.com/ssun__planet/status/1011996292304605185?s=19)

**Birthday**: July 21st, 1995   
**Nicknames**: Sexy Bandit (aw yeah), Dongho Bridge  
**Positions**: Main Vocal   
**Social Media**: [@realbaekho](https://www.instagram.com/realbaekho/?hl=en) on instagram

Baekho has a bunch of tattoos, hence you rarely ever see him without long sleeves. Ones a compass, a reference to Nuests logo and ones a white tiger for his stage name (which was given to him by After Schools Uee) 

He worked as a vocal director on Pristins debut mini and behind most of Nuests recent production/lyric work, he has main credits on pretty much every song since Q is. But then funnily enough [his solo song](https://youtu.be/gM0GgXOEynM) was actually written by Seventeens Woozi! He's also friends with Pristin's Kyulkyung. 

He was also on King of Masked Singers THIS week what good timing he actually got through to the third round, [heres his second solo performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t70FnM8ljEg) and heres[ the reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWSOL8hYHsQ) v cute.   
**During P101** Baekho was subjected to MNets lovely jungle drum background music whenever he entered a room, which fit really well when his[ first performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqX2SSl-xT0) turned out to be BTS Boy In Luv or Sangnamja. Got him that whole rough real man image, which continued throughout the show (they did an arm wrestle competition, it was glorious). His position evaluation stage was a [rock version of Playing With Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oj6LPCtCYI) together with Minki (having the time of his life). 

He was also the main vocal in [Open Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPJRT1cSxM) and got moved to Super Hot, where he met the love of his life, [Megaton Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSeHE6YoSQ0) (watch the whole video tbh, I stand by the fact that Super Hot is underrated). He eventually came in 13th. However, lets discuss this whole sexy bandit business. 

**About:**   
Now, he does look intimidating, especially compared to the more flower boy aesthetic prevalent in kpop. I think he very much **has a vision** of what he wants to do, especially when it comes to music (flashback to him almost getting into a fight with jung sewoon over doing a rock or acoustic playing with fire performance during produce). That can make him seem even more stern, imho. Hence also the amount of production work hes doing for the band right now. 

  
However, he's honestly such a **softie**? He's really loving? You wouldn't really expect it looking at them, but he's the one who's always smiling. He just makes me smile too idk. Watching a P101 video (apart from a few selected clips) and then watching a Nuest video is such whiplash when it comes to Baekho (all of them, tbh, but him the most). His voice is also obviously the backdrop for basically all of their songs and that coupled with his influence on their music on the technical side makes him super integral to their overall image. Also, he can be a cheeky little shit (especially bickering with Minhyun) and [has the cutest laugh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR422eHwk2U). 

[**++Hwang Minhyun**](https://twitter.com/WHITEDREAMER_mh/status/987645151664193536)

**Birthday**: July 21st, 1995   
**Nicknames**: Hwang CEO, Emperor Hwang, Shanghai Boy (from this appearance in an After School song)  
**Positions**: Lead Vocal, Visual  
**Social Media**: [@optimushwang](https://www.instagram.com/optimushwang/?hl=en) on instagram, where he hasnt posted since getting into w1 so if you want smthg more current check out[ @wannaone.official](https://www.instagram.com/wannaone.official/?hl=dea)

  
Minhyun has [a collab single with indie singer Fromm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoGNFsrmtvM) which to be honest with you is the most lovely song out there (also bring this hairstyle back damn). 

He also wrote the lyrics to his duo song called Daybreak which he did with JR and produced Thank You (Every Evening) from Canvas. 

Minhyun on **P101** quickly got attention when he formed Sorry Sorry Team 2, or the Justice League. Got him the nickname Hwang CEO and made him the[ head of a new religion](https://youtu.be/AID0PwdGp7c). Besides Sorry Sorry he was a part of Never as well as Downpour during the positions eval and the one Nuest member over in [Hands On Me](https://youtu.be/wsP8LIHMNOI) during the finale. But tbh the highlight of the entire show regarding Minhyun was him somewhat adopting Cubes Seonho. Its adorable, dont fight me on this (tbh all the Nuest boys kept collecting younger trainees). 

He came in 9th and joined Wanna One. Now, if yall ever wanna get a bit depressed watch the video so Minhyun at the P101 finale. I think he def wanted and wants to be in Wanna One, but [he has said on Happy Together](https://youtu.be/0PBAVPAXXRE) that he didnt expect to go promote over there alone, so he was in a bit of a shock. However, hes off being his best pretty prince self and killing the piano part in Energetic.   
**About:**   
Minhyun's just so **caring**? He's just very attentive to his members and does a lot of like, subtle checking in with them? it's hard to notice at first, but he does a similar thing now with Wanna One. But then and with nu'est especially he's also just a **cheeky little shit** tbh lmao. I mean he is the second youngest, and he acts like it. Like that one time he tried to feed Jonghyun a tomato (he hates them) and laughed his ass off afterwards, or when he tries to become[ their new main rapper](https://youtu.be/o7wd6MmS21A). Hes also super clingy?? My favourite genre of pictures is [Minhyun hangs on Ren, who couldnt be less enthusiastic about it](https://pannative.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-moments-when-hwang-minhyun-acts.html). 

He also knows he's the visual of the group and he knows how to use it? I mean, he obviously sings like a fairy prince but he also knows he LOOKS like one and that his image, especially now, is very much like, proper pretty prince sort of deal. And while he's a goof off stage he turns that up to 11 the second the song starts?

[**++ Cho Minki/Ren**](https://twitter.com/forfairy113/status/1011943653881798656?s=19)

**Birthday**: November 3rd, 1995   
**Nicknames**: Shoulder Gangster, and a bunch within the band: Our/Uri Ren, Mango, Choi Ren, ec.   
**Positions**: Vocal, Maknae  
**Social Media**: [@glorypath ](https://www.instagram.com/glorypath/)on instagram, [@choigoren](https://twitter.com/choigoren) on twitter

Rens the biggest goddamn Lady Gaga Fan. No honestly, hed probably faint if he met her. 

Hes also very [unapologetic about his English](https://youtu.be/Mr7OaXHOxWQ) and will torture Aron with it. Though tbh they all do. 

He also supplies us with the [cute cat content](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeNpVq4FFg8/?taken-by=glorypath) we so desire.   
**During Produce 101**, Minki had surprisingly little screen time considering he was the most popular Nuest member before. You could often spot him in the background without a mic. However he did have the aforementioned [Shoulder Gangster ](https://youtu.be/L9z-EPVgb9A)moment as well as a few other scenes, and he eventually came in at number 20. His first stage was [Replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW2LF9xRL5I), followed up by Playing With Fire during the position evaluation and [Oh Little Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXnvn-XQz00) during the concept eval, where he was actually the center.   
**About:**   
Ren's **fearless**. No honestly, that's the best word I can think of. He's out there [modelling for an androgynous clothing company in a skirt](http://www.asianjunkie.com/2016/05/09/nuests-ren-models-skirts-and-dresses-for-vip-shop-in-china/) with his long hair even though that gets him misgendered a lot, [loving Lady Gaga](https://youtu.be/xc-efBf5-RA)l without any shame, he always just [/does it/](https://youtu.be/FUaM6FQzMLo) even if doing is is singing Just Dance with Aron while the rest of this mess of a band does their weird dance moves behind them. 

And that translates to the stage, too. Without any shred of holding himself back. And he's not fake about it? He's a performer through and through because he enjoys doing it (he also picked up a lot of younger trainees during p101 since he was often paired with them, bless his heart, he seemed to really care for them well). 

# + Group Dynamic

After that behemoth of an introduction, I wanted to take a quick second to talk about their group dynamic. Now obviously every fan claims that their band is 100&amp;#37; the closest and most loving and yadada and I think we can never now this for sure. Selling their dynamic is as much their job as selling their music, in a lot of cases. So in the end what matters to me as a fan (and consumer) is that I find the dynamic they show enjoyable, and hot damn does Nuest do that well. 

Nuest isnt the loudest or flashiest or most craziest group. Theyre pretty chill and low key, both music and personality wise. But: considering theyve now been in a group for over six years and spent a lot of that time abroad alone, they seem very comfortable with each other. Theyre relaxed and a lot more loose than they are in different circumstances like variety shows. They joke around a lot, theyre touchy, etc etc. Whether that seems genuine to you is in the end something you have to judge yourself. Here is a [long ass twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ProtectNUEST/status/876721587067641857) with ot5 interactions from the obvious to the mundane like instagram and twitter posts back when basically no one was looking. But yeah their interactions and were one of the key factors that got me into them, so I encourage you to keep an eye on that if youre into that sort of stuff!  


# + Basic Videos

So, lets do five basic videos Id recommend you watch from different categories. If theyre quite long Ill give you a shorter alternative. Again thank you to /u/kaktusgedanken for prompting this!  
**1. One of those guides on the youtubes:**   
The one thing people usually bring up when it comes to Nu'est videos is the [Documentary and Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MMrm12iY04&amp;t=13s). It basically mixes their ""history"" and member intros with a lot of different clips and voice overs from Aron's radio show. I do think it's the best intro to them as people and as a group, but it's also pretty long? For the member intros skip about 10 minutes forward.   
Alternatively: [this one's a bit shorter ](https://youtu.be/KYGdbeKhwrI)and also goes into Produce 101.   
**2. For the variety angle:**   
I always come back to their [Private Life ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-33HdfklvA)episodes, which are tbh more like a low budget vlive thing? where they answer fan questions and do truth or dare or karaoke and let's dance. I linked episode 2 which is my favourite and shows off their group dynamic quite well, but is also quite long so again  
Alternatively: a [funny moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj-TX5G3_GM) compilation that i really like  
**3. For self produced content:**   
Another thing to show off their dynamic now as a four member group is the Love Record series which they did for their first comeback/debut and are still doing now. It's basically a behind the scenes of the recording and then promotion with a bit of like extra content in between. [Here's episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6rCspk5OFw)  
**4. For a fun short thing:**   
I'm weirdly fond of [this part switch version](https://youtu.be/WMPccAzF8nA) they did for Love Paint, especially since Minhyun's just fucking losing the plot of what he's supposed to do even though the back up dancers try their hardest to help him. They also did one for [Where You At with constumes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2YWDM9TK6k)!! Bless!!  
**5. For some Emotions:**   
This is maybe a bit of a weird choice but [Jonghyun's letter at a Japanese fan meet ](https://youtu.be/s07rFYOkM1M)is just. god. heart wrenching. I think it honestly sums up not just the position they were in but also Jonghyun as a leader? Also everyone's crying and no one can sing lmao.   
If you want to focus more on the group there's also [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFCKRCv6gu8) of them watching video messages sent by their parents? (Which he actually references in the letter. I particularly love the end where they sort of try to lift the mood as a group.

60,2018-07-02,2018,7,2,11,8vf09c,The connection between loona and exo,shadybitch8900,1530497060,"Going off the theory that says that LOONA is actually from SM but SM wants to prove that they can make a girl group and make them popular without the SM title, We all know that SM's groups are corresponded each 2 groups have similar number of members, similar concepts and image (Suju-SNSD/SHINee-f(x) and then there's EXO, who are unique from Red Velvet, big number of members only Chinese and Korean members, and red velvet is not their corresponded girl group, It's LOONA
Both(12 members/ only Korean and Chinese members/ sci-fi? concepts)

And it's too similar to be a Coincidence, is it possible that the EXO planet is located in the LOONAVERSE? Yes, and the biggest pieces of evidence is: the amount of money that BBC spent on LOONA for a PRE-debut project, even though THEY'ER Unknown/just launched/ LOONA is their first group, where did they get all this money, unless SM is giving them the money, or SM is owing BBC,

Now, the second piece of this theory is the ships, EXO is popular for their shippers, most popular one is Kai&amp;DO, a tall handsome main dancer and a cute small main vocal, just like Yves&amp;Chuu, a tall beautiful main dancer and a cute small main vocal, and we all know that BBC itself started shipping them, and another popular ship is Chanbeak, 2 similar (kind of) looking members one is a main vocal and the other one is an assigned rapper, despite being a really good vocal similar to kimsoul 

And how LOONA look like a SM group, mainly for the visuals, and we know SM's focus on visuals for their artists, like all of them are really beautiful, and lastly the last piece of the theory is: how when LOONA started they were news talking about the trainees in BBC they are training to become members, I think it was 300-500 trainees and it was called the LOONATION or something like that, how did they get THAT many trainees even though they JUST started??

Red Velvet's [Time Slip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9wqjEBHmMY) does as well! Upon closer inspection, there are slight variations in all four beats, but their overall feel is extremely similar, which got me wondering... what other k-pop songs have components that sound like each other? I see a lot of comparisons between k-pop songs and western songs, but what about within k-pop - and are they by the same producer/composer? Between the two (or however many), is there one song you prefer?

(Yoo Young-jin played a role in the production of Boss and BDS, but the other two songs have no similar people)",97,46

I was rewatching the MV when I got the feeling it looked familiar, and then I saw Alchemelia Hospital. After a little digging I found the overworld map from Origins fits best. Who would have guessed a Kpop video would include a callback to a horror game ~8 years older than it?

I am starting a dance cover team in Los Angeles! The team will  primarily focus on doing dance covers of K-pop and J-pop songs. If you live in Los Angeles, love to dance, want to meet other K-pop and J-pop fans, and would like to push yourself to grow as a dancer and performer, then this team could be perfect for you! If you are interested in joining or have questions, then please pm me!

Heres a little bit more information about the team:

The team is open to everyone who is 18 years of age or older, regardless of their experience/background in dance. Beginners who are passionate about doing dance covers but have no formal dance training are invited to join! Also, whether you are considered to be young or old by  K-pop standards (e.g. late 20s, mid 30s etc.), you are welcome to join :)!

In addition to being 18 years of age or older, you must be passionate about dancing and K-pop/J-pop and be able to commit to participating in weekly dance practices. You will be expected to bring your enthusiasm for dance and your love for K-pop/J-pop to practice, support and encourage your teammates in their dance pursuits, and push yourself to grow individually as a dancer through the teams dance activities.

The team will aim to create safe, welcoming spaces for all of its members. Racism, misogyny, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism, and homophobia will not be tolerated. Through its dance activities the team will strive to spread love and uplift its members and others.

Details regarding what songs the team will cover, when and where and how often the team will hold dance practice, and where the team will perform its dance covers will be decided by the team as a group after its members are finalized.",4,0

**Discussion time!** What were your favorite moments through the series? Most surprising?

I'd have to say that the bond that Yunho developed with the children was absolutely lovely and surprising in that he only spent 3 days with them, but they were so sad when he left... Ugh, the precious movie, cards, and banner made me cry so many times that episode. ;\_; I loved how caring he was especially towards Minho and the boy that always fell asleep (sorry I can't remember his name).

For Changmin, I LOVE how there were tons of meme-worthy moments - and his facial expressions! The episode with SHINee's Minho was great in that their friendly banter was prominent yet they were trying to be professional because of the setting, hahaha. I really think him and Chef Choi Hyun Suk would make for a great duo for some cooking variety show. They're on the same page in their wit, and I could really see them feeding off each other well. 

I hope they'll each get to see everyone again. ;;",7,15

Im really happy Exid made it big, and its funny seeing comments about waiting for YGs new girl group. Thats BlackPink, right? It took them another four years to debut.  There are some surprises on this listI thought Ailee has been active longer, since she has such a strong and mature voice. Same with AOA. I guess they debuted two years after I got into kpop, but I assumed they were 2ne1s generation. I had hoped Evol would do well because the instrumental to Get Up was good. I also thought Crayon Pop was older.  And Fiestar came and went, which was sad. I feel like Lee Hi hasnt released much in a while. Not enough to have been active since 2012. Nuests revival has been really nice. And VIXX I thought was more recent, actually. Any surprises for you? ",1,2

Please *do not* make it into an unpopular opinion thread, naturally the line between the two can be blurry sometimes but stick to what affects you personally. 

For me - a while ago I was at the supermarket and heard a song that strongly reminded me of a song by a group I really liked. I managed to shazam it and yes, on repeated listens I still can't shake the feeling there are some notes that are too similar (even though the two songs overall are really different). The song I heard randomly came out years before the song from the group I like... but obviously because I love the group and don't want to cause any unnecessary troubles for them I'll never point it out explicitly.",1120,279

[Source @ 5:54](https://www.vlive.tv/video/78375/playlist/75397)

So one of the clips of Comedian Singer Producer Stream Please (hosted by Hyungdon and Song Eun-yi), Hyungdon invites Apink to listen to a new song that was made with Hyungdon as the composer and the rest(?) is by Hui from Pentagon. The song is going to be a duet/collaboration because Hui is the male singer and they're trying to find a female singer that could fit for the song. So Apink start giving out names that they think will be the best for the song, they mentioned groups that will having a comeback soon. Names like Momoland and Twice were mentioned but before that Apink suggested GFriend as ""they're about to release a new album too"".

The conversation was recorded on July 24th, the same time Apink did a recording of their appearance in Idol Room. That's why they mentioned Momoland (June 26th) and Twice (July 9th) as suggestions.

Source Music hasn't announced anything about the comeback yet so this spoiler might be a big scoop.

The rules, as always:

**1**: Name a group or artist

**2**: Name five songs of theirs we should listen to (links are appreciated!)

**3**: Optional things to share:

* Why you chose those 5 songs
* Tell us about the members
* Brief history of the group/notable events
* Why do you like this group?
* Fanclub name/colour?
* Any notable variety shows/diary shows/interviews/behind the scenes/dance rehearsals etc.?
* Any live performances particularly worth watching?

\&gt; You can post about any group or artist, from rookies to the biggest groups - someone will still be discovering them for the first time!

\&gt; Post about as many groups/artists as you like, but in a separate comment for each please

\&gt; Recyling &amp; updating your own comments from past threads is fine but please don't copy/paste somebody else's without their permission

\&gt; If someone has already posted about your faves, feel free to make your own post anyway, or add to theirs in the comments - the more the merrier!

\&gt; Leaving a placeholder comment is handy if you don't have time to put your post together right away

\&gt; You're never too late to the thread to contribute!

This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment. Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48 hours to check. good luck!",21,15

From the first episode onwards I don't get why she's been favoured by Mnet or the Produce48 team.

Her performance in the second episode was definitely not an A, I wouldn't even call it a D.

Her centre selection performance was again the most unimpressive one.

Her singing and dancing skills are below average.

Her confidence is non existent, I don't see star quality in her. Jurina got a B and she smiled with confidence.

People are calling her visuals the best but to me she looks like a 12 year old kid, Jurina at least looks her age.

""Why"" is the only thing that comes to my mind when I see Mnet and PD48 bias towards her.",2,0

At this point, in every Korean show where there is an audience member, all the girls seem to have pale faces and red lips, to the point where it's just scary and they all just look the same. I get that this is the new ""look"" and it fits pretty much every face, it's just starting to get creepy at this point. This is also the ideal type of look in Korea, so I guess it's not going to change much in the future...",3,0

450,2018-07-06,2018,7,6,13,8wh8u2,How is the kpop landscape gonna look like in the next 5 years?,dgplr,1530852097,"Honestly even 1 year can feel like an eternity in kpop, especially when groups comeback multiple times in a short interval of time.

Even contemplating the next  2 years seems so daunting because things change so fast in the kpop world. 

I think the BTS hype will definitely die down, which will be kind of initiated by the army recruitment of the members but they will still be popular. I don't know if I can say the same for Exo. SM has mismanaged a lot of older bgs and given them less and less comebacks and just relegated them to concerts and solo activities if you are marketable.

I love NCT but I think it's going to be an absolute mess...I think a few of the members might want to leave. I think they will be popular though. Bigbang is gonna come back with a bang and become like Shinhwa but infinitely more relevant.

On the girl group front, I think Twice' popularity might take a dive or prosper like SNSD, idk, I think groups like Loona will be popular internationally but may also break into the national kpop scene if they have the right song which I think they will. The SM and JYP new gg will also compete with Loona for girl group domination. I think Black pink will have a major American breakthrough. And RV, if there are no scandals will continue to have a very solid, dedicated female fandom and will keep creating bops (kinda like SHINee) just more infrequently with Joy seriously pursuing acting and Seulgi and Wendy maybe having solos or a sub-unit.

Both fandoms have been respectful to each other through this and it would be great if it could stay that way here.

 **The issue:**

Golden Childs recent album, Goldenness released on the 4th of July has come under question from K-IGOT7s recently due to the similarities with GOT7s Turbulence and Departure albums. 

The photo proof for everything will be at the end of this post. 

Golden Childs concept for this comeback was one about Flight, alike GOT7s Flight Log series (which Turbulence and Departure were part of). 

Now, often, concepts are done by more than one group because theres only so many concepts that groups can choose from but there is a difference between a concepts and the designs and contents for album exterior and interiors. 

**What Golden Child and GOT7 fans have been doing about it:**

Fans of both groups have been understanding of the issue at hand and have both been asking Woollim for clarification. They do not want Golden Child to come under fire for something they probably had no say in.

**Please note: you will need a google/gmail account to vote. This is to prevent people spamming votes for their songs. EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE NOT BEING RECORDED, I PROMISE.**

&amp;nbsp;

**VOTING WILL CLOSE FRIDAY, JULY 13TH AT WHATEVER TIME I FEEL LIKE IT.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Fun Facts This Round**

1. Yall still can't read, or follow instructions. So many boy group songs nominated. 

2. Lot less trolling this round, happy to know we're maturing with age. Whoever nominated Miracles in December, yes, you're *very funny*.

3. Girl Front was somehow nominated in 15 different ways.

4. Those of yall who nominated songs that haven't even come out yet are also *very funny*.

#FAQ TIME

**Q: I don't know what this is.**

A: This is r/kpop sings! It is a community project inspired by the super successful [r/anime sings project](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/sings). The community nominates, votes for, and then records themselves singing a kpop song of their choice, which is then edited and released by the r/kpop sings team. Anyone can nominate and vote, and everyone is encouraged to sing. Check out our previous songs on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ), and follow our [tweeter for updates](https://twitter.com/redditSingsKpops).

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: WHERE IS MY SONG? I NOMINATED THE PERFECT SUMMER SONG AND IT IS NOT HERE**

A. I know, and I'm sorry. There are two reasons this is possible: 

1. It was not a summer song. 

2. There was not a useable instrumental. 

Useable instrumental doesn't necessarily mean *official* instrumental, really good recreations or edits are fine, and some songs (especially recently released songs - sorry!) don't have those. Since we'd like to get this done in a timely matter, some songs had to go. Sorry. If I eliminated it because it's not a summer song by my criteria, feel free to pitch a fit in the comments, I might even read it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: How come I only get to vote once? Last time I could vote for 5 songs!**

A: Fewer songs, fewer votes. Sorry!

&amp;nbsp;

**Q: What a cool project!!! How can I help??**

A: Name the fandom! Throw suggestions below or tweet them at us.


&amp;nbsp;

I really want to pre-order Twice's new album on Amazon, but since I live in Germany, most older Twice albums require me to pay an Import Fee in addition to the shipment fee itself.

But the new ""Summer Nights"" Album only wants me to pay a shipping fee of 5$, and I just wonder whether I won't have to pay any import fee at all or if this will be added once the album is actually release and ready to ship.

I hope that someone knows an answer to this :3

**The Details:**

There will be 2 ways that you can watch the livestream.

1. Starting at 7:00PM KST (6:00AM EST, 3:00AM PST) the concert will be livestreamed on the FREE CUBE-TV Hangtime App, available on both iOS and Google Play
2. Starting at 10:00PM KST (9:00AM EST, 6:00AM PST) the concert will be livestreamed on YouTube through the CUBE TV ON Livestream

[Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChmgLB8HZnVLJJv5iGht6kA)

[CUBE-TV on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiswe.hangtimeCubeTv)

[CUBE-TV on iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/kr/app/cube-tv-on-hangtime/id1325342442?mt=8)

**What to Expect:**

The details of what will be broadcast have not been released, so there may be differences in what will be broadcast on the two streams. Choose the stream that best fits your time. 

The App offers a multiview camera (think of it as live fancams of individual members) and an in-App chat feature. People who watched the concert through the App back in June have reported excellent stream quality for the full duration of the concert. 

**What You're Here For:**

In the comments below, feel free to comment on the performances, issues that you have, or fangirl/fanboy to your heart's content. I will be here for the full duration of the livestreams, so DM me or comment below if you have any issues. I do not work for Cube Entertainment nor do I have any contact with them, so unfortunately  I cannot send them any grievances that you may have. I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy the concert.",185,90

I was the last person In my group to go 
I sang my song my heart will go on 
I sang the end part of it because they said to only sing the highlight 
The judge and the camera lady were both looking at me smiling looking very interested 
The lady moved my paper away from the others where the camera lady was sitting next to her camera 
They both looked at each other 
The camera lady gave her an ""are you sure"" look
They Said something to each other that I didn't hear
And then the judge nodded                                               The camera lady looked kind of surprised 
Then they asked us to leave  
 

I bullet pointed only the important things that happened during the audition because if I didn't it would have been very long. The judges didn't do this with anyone else in my group and to some of the girls they weren't even looking so I was very surprised when I saw them smiling at me so brightly when I sang my song. But I was also confused when they asked us all to leave and didn't ask anyone to stay back. I auditioned at the New York audition and I heard that a boy and a girl were held back towards the end but I'm not sure if it was true. I haven't heard about anyone who has gotten a callback and I'm confused because it's been over a month. I found out the same thing happened to one other girl at the San Francisco location but I haven't heard it happen to anyone else. At first I thought it was nothing but now that I know it happened to someone else I'm beginning to think differently but I still have no idea. Please help me figure out what's going on ",3,3

So, getting back to my question, is the sexy/mature/girl crush concept the always expected to go/route or end game concept for GGs who have been in the industry for a long time? If not, what are the groups that didnt do this and what concept did they do?

663,2018-07-09,2018,7,9,7,8x5j4q,What personally insightful things did you find within kpop?,FineAppleDice,1531090149,"Anything goes (advice,interview, idol background etc.) as long as it made you learn something personally meaningful!

For example, I really admire Taemin's excellent performance skill &amp; artistic idol image. And this \[interview\] ([http://www.anothermanmag.com/life-culture/10064/taemin-the-singer-stretching-the-boundaries-of-k-pop](http://www.anothermanmag.com/life-culture/10064/taemin-the-singer-stretching-the-boundaries-of-k-pop)) (and from Taemin in general) was one of the few analogous things I read that shows the importance in embracing discomfort &amp; being tirelessly deliberate (along with deep work, deliberate practice, etc.} to achieve the valuable outcomes that you want: 

\&gt;When I was 16 and 17 years old, I dreamed of becoming a perfect, a more complete artist by the time I turned 20, TAEMIN recalls of his expectations. 

However, I realized that you dont transform into a completely new person just because you become an adult and, before I realized it, Id already turned 20 yet still wanted to become a better artist. 

Even now, as an influential and successful pop star, he spends plenty of private time considering the evolution of that public persona. 

Before I fall asleep, I always think about how I could be more acknowledged as an artist, a good one, he adds. 

I think about how I could let people know more about my music and what kind of an artist I am. My head is filled with these thoughts nowadays.

I also thought from 1st impression (during the days I was just getting into kpop)that he was \*just\* an immensely talented individual rather than someone who sacrificed \[blood, sweat &amp; tears\]([https://www.soompi.com/2017/10/22/shinees-taemin-talks-struggles-improve-singer/](https://www.soompi.com/2017/10/22/shinees-taemin-talks-struggles-improve-singer/)) to literally evolve into who he is now. So those words carry a lot of weight in my opinion.

673,2018-07-09,2018,7,9,11,8x73cx,The Future for Hallyu Fans: A Better Ticketing System Using KStarCoin,FacelessOnes,1531102920,"Have you ever heard of problems with scalping tickets before? It is indeed a huge problem, *especially* in  the K-pop world. Sometimes the ticket prices are so high that it goes  up to 1000&amp;#37; of the original price. So frustrating, isnt it? Most of the  time, seats are unavailable for most fans who really want to go to the  event.

In  our opinion, the ticket market right now is not transparent and fans  are often left out of the equation. Adding inexplicable transaction  costs to tickets is a common activity among ticketing companies. Funny  thing is, it is illegal to sell all the tickets on-site, but it isnt  illegal to sell them online; even so, fines are only 200 dollars. Due to  this environment, black market traders dont mind selling tickets for a  higher price.

KStarLive  has the solution for this nonsensical situation: KStarCoin. Its a  blockchain based event ticketing protocol in the process of buying and  selling tickets through cooperating with booking companies,  entertainment agencies, and even with fans. Decentralized ticketing  issuance and tracking protocol will be able to block ticket scalpers,  who typically buy the large number of tickets and re-sell them on  numerous different sites. This protocol will make secondary market  ticket prices and ticket fraud occurrences disappear; it will provide  absolute transparency for all parties involved in the process.

Another  thing that you should remember about the blockchain-based ticketing  protocol is that the owner of such a smart ticket is also free to  anonymously sell his or her tickets. However, it will be automatically  done within the decentralized infrastructure of the protocol. This  ensures that ticket trades are done safely and within a set price margin  (*say good-bye to ridiculously priced tickets!*) which is a good thing for both sellers and purchasers, isnt it?

KStarLive  has a goal to create a communication-oriented service between fans and  Hallyu stars. We believe that this goal will be achieved faster, safer,  and more transparent with a blockchain platform. It will also benefit  numerous parties involved and we will be the center of the global Hallyu  culture. This new cultural movement with blockchain technology will  serve as a medium of communication between stars and fans.",3,0

This time, I'm going to be recounting my BLACKPINK Square Up Yeouido Fansign experience! I was quite lucky to be able to get in to this fansign as usually I do group orders to be able to afford the albums needed to attend them, especially for bigger groups like BLACKPINK, but I wasn't able to organize one. I was fresh off the heels of my BTS group order (250+ albums, jeez) and I just couldn't overwhelm myself and organize it. So, I bought the albums out of pocket, hoping for the best. To my astonished luck, I made it in! 

I was really excited, not only because -- well -- it's BLACKPINK, my queens, but also because I was FRESH off the heels of a cursed Momoland fansign (MMLD themselves were great, it was other aspects that made it a cursed experience) and another cursed yyxy sign a week prior (again, yyxy are angels, nothing to do with them!). So, it felt like my week was going to end on a pretty okay note!

I was ecstatic to be able to get a spot in the last Square Up fansign for BP's very first physical album. To have BP's first physical signed, I was vibrating with excitement. ([I'm reminded of a comment I made not too long ago on this very sub about their first physical... I sure kept that promise of throwing money at it](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6jaqto/blackpink_we_have_a_lot_of_songs_that_we_have/djcu5rj/)) But the chance to MEET the girls themselves was even more of a trip for me.

When you get the notification that you've won a spot in the fansign, you have under 24 hours to prepare. I didn't have the time nor the funds, really, to buy a bunch of gifts and such, so I opted to write letters to all four members instead. They were all pretty personal so I don't really want to share them, but basically I told them in plain as day words that no matter what happened to BLACKPINK, we would be there until the very end, and that BP is such an inspiration for young girls and women all over. Which it's true, they are!

I prepared the letters and post its, although I didn't have much hope for the post its because... well. It's YG. YG (and the other big 3) aren't really known for their uh... dedication to making fan experiences pleasant. And I suppose before I get in to the details of the sign, I have to put a caveat/warning type thing on this fan account: If you aren't on the ""YG need to calm the hell down and take a seat"" circlejerk train, then you probably don't want to read this fan account. Because I have a lot of things to say about YG's handling of this sign. *However*, if you want to hear about how JISOO, LISA, JENNIE, AND ROSE ARE ABSOLUTE ANGELS AND QUEENS, then you'll probably want to read on.

So! I got to IFC mall in Yeouido a few hours early because a friend of mine was attending the LOONA yyxy sign earlier in that day and I was there as moral support. Out of yyxy's 4 signs for love4eva, I attended 3, and I put all of my extra money in to the BP sign so I didn't end up buying for LOONA this week. :( But, as a mini fan account, the girls looked happy, healthy, and they were sweet as always! Public fan signs are really nice for promoting smaller groups and drumming up interest, but I was pretty surprised that BP were doing a public sign. While BP isn't as big as they *could* be in Korea because they are out of the spotlight so much, they are still quite beloved here. Especially with foreign fans living in Korea. I think the fact that their first (?) and last signs were in a more public area was more for publicity than anything, which it's YG so. I get it.

As soon as yyxy ended, at around 5pm, people began congregating for BP. The sign didn't start until 8:15 so I wandered off to eat and recharge since I had a seat in the sign and didn't need to queue up. I spent the time looking over my letters and stuffing my face. My friend who did the yyxy sign stayed for the BP sign on the sidelines.

At around 7:45pm, I went up to the bookstore to draw my seat number, hoping for a good shot. I really wanted to take some good photos since I wasn't sure when BP would be having another comeback (I shed a tear every time I think about this) and hoped for something good. I ended up getting number 55 (out of 114) so I was somewhere in the middle, but in the center aisle seat for a pretty good view. I was able to get good photos of all the girls, which I'll be processing, editing, and uploading over the next few days (but I've included some in the end of this post for you guys to see!!) I set up my camera and waited for the start of the sign. A about twenty minutes until it was supposed to begin, they handed out Sprite bottles to everyone in the sign with a sticker with one of the members on it! [I got Jisoo!](https://imgur.com/o1v3hb1) (Now I don't ever want to drink it ;__; )

Immediately as soon as it got within fifteen minutes of the sign starting, I was already noticing how YG staff SWARMED this area. If I could sum up this fansign in one word aside from AMAZING (because of the girls), I would use the word ""claustro-fucking-phobic"". I was really confused why they would bother having a public fansign if they had to have THIS much personnel swarming the area... at some point I think I realized that this was a classic YG power move? I've seen it at events with other YG artists. The girls were fine, there was no danger, I think it was YG just kinda... throwing their weight around. They did it simply because they could.

When the girls finally came out, the amount of personnel doubled. I have been to quite a few fansigns and I have NEVER seen this many people up on stage with the artists at one time. A lot of companies realize that fans spend a large sum of money buying albums to support the artist and get to spend one on one time with their favs, so they give you some room. With LOONA and Momoland and other similar artists, there were maybe two, MAX three handlers up there at once helping move people along and getting handed off the gifts from fans. I've only ever seen this amount of swarming with YG and SM. YG decided to plant a handler right over the shoulder of every member, PLUS two handlers looking like the president's secret service ushering people along. Oh, and YG had four official photographers taking pictures and video at the same time too... It was a little disheartening. Fansigns aren't supposed to be a publicity stunt, like I felt YG was turning it in to. They're supposed to just be a few hours for fans to connect with the artists and have fun. But, YG saw a marketing opportunity and took it. I guess we will see those photos in a DVD or something soon.

It all just felt really claustrophobic. I didn't really feel comfortable speaking at all in front of so many managers breathing right over their shoulders, and twice I saw Jennie put her hand out to the one standing over her to make him back up. Good for her. They were literally breathing down those poor girls' necks. I'm happy that I was able to speak in English with Jennie, Lisa, and Rose, because I felt a little more free to talk. Anyways... 

When the girls came out, there was a huge round of cheering and applause. Tons of fans had gathered even if they didn't have a spot in the sign to see and support the girls. Even onlookers that don't know about the girls were excitedly taking pictures with their phones just to say they'd been there. I felt really lucky to be in the actual sign.

Another thing that I was side-swiped by YG about was how quickly they moved people through the sign. I filmed my friend when she was up at yyxy talking to them, and from start to finish it was about 4:20s to talk to all four members. So about 1 minute per member. I had maybe... 25 seconds. Usually you have chairs at the tables and can sit for a little bit to chat in a relaxed manner, and if no chairs are provided you just kneel. This is the norm.

YG made us stand. [I took a picture of the stage](https://imgur.com/a7QFVJq) just so you could see how fucking crowded this was up there. This is NOT how it normally is at other signs, but you can see how crowded it was because you can't even see the girls. We weren't allowed to kneel because it's too slow to usher us by. Usually you don't move down on to the next member until the person in front of you has moved on, too. That way it's always one person in front of one member at a time. Not the case here. They ushered us to move on even if the person in front of us wasn't finished... they made us literally wait in line for the next member, behind the person talking to them. It was so bizarre. If one of the girls was taking too long to sign an album, the intimidating-looking managers were physically *pulling the album out of their hands* to hurry them along. I was so shocked! Oh, and my gut feeling about the post-its was correct. Those were nixed in line. As we were waiting to go up, on of the managers thumbed through our albums and told us to take them out. Oh well, I kind of saw that coming, so...

But enough about the YG annoyance circlejerk because they're not important. What's important IS BLACKPINK. So I'll go member by member now that I've gotten the YG rant out of the way. Were their policies a little upsetting? Yeah, but it definitely didn't ruin the experience for me. I'm still happy I was able to go, but I just wanted to make sure I included the not so good with the great, so if anyone ever goes to a BP sign they'll know what to expect!

***ROS:***

First up was Ros. I went up there and I think she was waiting to see if I was going to speak English or Korean to her, so she could follow suit accordingly. Of course I spoke English, and she immediately smiled and said in her Aussie accent ""Hi, hello, how are you!"" Her voice is so high and cute, and she was very animated. She asked me how I was doing and I said that I was doing well, and happy to be there. She said ""Oh, great! Where are you from?"" I told her I was from American and she asked what city. When I told her, she said she always wanted to visit there (my city). I told her that I hoped they would do a concert there one day and she said she did, too. She said, ""You've come a long way!"" She asked how long I would be in Korea for and I said that I live here. She was really happy about that, and said that she hoped to see me again at a future event, and I told her I for sure would, and that I'd be supporting BLACKPINK for a long time to come. She was really thankful for that. 

Then she signed my album, she was sad because her pen was running out, so she asked her manager for another one (and he didn't budge??) so she just signed it with the sad pen, lmao. I told her her signature was really cute and she said that she hopes next time she can sign for me with a better pen (she emphasized the last two words really loudly and I think... she was talking to the manager lmao. Never change Chaeng). 

I gave her the letter I had prepared and she smiled and said she couldn't wait to open it and thanked me for coming and supporting BLACKPINK. I said OF COURSE ROSE I LOVE YOU (I didn't actually scream this like I wanted to, just said of course, and that I would support BP forever). As I was leaving she also told me she liked my shirt I was wearing (a crop top) and I said I'd actually bought it here in Korea at an H&amp;M and she gave me this side-eye?? that I can't explain other than it was a look that said she wanted to go find it. It was cute!

[Here is a picture of her sign in my album!](https://imgur.com/whrlskB)


***LISA***

Next up was Lisa! Admittedly, Lisa is my bias and has been since their very first teasers ever dropped prior to debut so this might get a little wordy and rambly. Again, like Ros, she waited for me to speak first so she could determine what language to speak in. She did begin saying hello in Korean as a reflex until she saw that I was a rando white girl and then gave me a look to go ahead first, so I did. I knew that Lisa could speak English, so I gave English a shot just to make it easier on myself, and she obliged.


Now, the first thing I have to say is that I always KNEW that Lisa was fluent in English. It's on all her profiles, she's typed messages in English before, she's talked about it a bit, but I had never actually *heard* her speak it before? I'm not the best at keeping up with much variety for groups that I like so I'm not sure if I ever missed it, so when I decided to attempt speaking in English with her, I wasn't sure how good her English is. I always knew she could speak it just fine (and I wrote my letter to her in English as well) but didn't know to what extent. And holy *shit* was I taken aback. Not only is her English impeccable, I mean not even exaggerating, it's perfect, but she also has *no* accent whatsoever when she speaks. For the little time that I was up there with her, her English (to me) sounded totally native. I was a little stunned so I stumbled over my words a little bit, but damn Lisa. What's she speak? Like sixteen languages? Anyways, LISA'S ENGLISH IS AMAZING and I was so happy that I was able to speak to my bias in my native language;;;; I've been able to speak just fine in Korean at other fansigns, but this was such a breath of fresh air. I was so happy. I know that in Korea she is well loved by the public because of her dedication to mastering the Korean language, so I think I should have known she'd do the same for her pursuit of studying English, too.

On to Lisa though! One of my favorite things about Lisa is her well-known ability to be an absolute BEAST on stage and then be this adorable, quirky, dweeby bean in person. And god, what a delightful person to be around. She's so bubbly and sweet, and so energetic even though I know those girls must've been exhausted. She asked me where I was from, and I said America. She also asked me what city as well, and she said that I came a long way. She asked if I had come just for them (she actually said ""me"", first and then laughed and said ""us"" as in all of BP, but I was almost like YES OF COURSE I LOVE YOU, god). I said that I actually live here, but that seeing them perform and attending a fansign was one of my dreams. She said she was so appreciative of that, and that she really hoped they could do a large concert tour some day. Then she looked at me and said, ""Wait -- you live here? So you actually *speak Korean*?"" And the gesture she made was so cute, she was like ""why aren't you practicing on me so we can both get better?"" lmao. I said that while I could speak okay in most day to day life, that mine wasn't that great and that I was even worse when I was nervous. She said that's totally fine, and she gets it. That sometimes she used to get nervous when she had to speak Korea, too, and it messed her up. Wow, what a sweetheart.

She started to sign my album and asked which page I wanted it on, and I went to the page where I had my post it with her name for easier organization, and she said this was her favorite picture. I said mine too! That's why I want it on this page. She thought that was really sweet. 

As she signed she said thank you so much for supporting Blackpink ""despite"", and then she kind of gave a gesture that said hold on a second and she corrected herself and said thank you for supporting Blackpink *through* everything. I told her she was really sweet and cute and she said thank you! As I was leaving, she gave me a high five where she grabbed my hand with her fingers and interlocked our fingers before letting go and omg... guys. I never realized how big Lisa's hands were until then. She has really long hands! I was red in the face from how cute and sweet (I'm sorry I can't think of more words, I'm so tired while writing this and I'm not a thesaurus lol) my bias was. I was SO HAPPY and I almost forgot to hand her my letter, but I DIDN'T FORGET GUYS. I gave her my letter and moved down the line.

[Here is her page in my album!](https://imgur.com/XeSGq08)

***JENNIE***

Next was Jennie! One of my absolute favorite things about Jennie is that she has the most intense case of RBF that I've ever seen. And believe me when I say that this is not an insult, it's a compliment, because I adore Jennie's entire badass vibe and persona. She *rocks* it, especially in person. I can't even convey how cool she is in the flesh, she's just a really suave person. So smooth. I *love* it. And I know from watching her vlives and variety and such that despite her outward persona and demeanor in BP on stage, she's actually a total fucking sweetheart in person. I adore Jennie more than I'll probably ever adore my own first born, so I was stoked to meet her. And I was right, in person she is just as sweet and kind and warm as I believed her to be. 

As soon as I got up to her, she didn't wait for me to speak first like Ros and Lisa had done, she just immediately started speaking in English to me. You know how when girls that haven't seen each other in a long time bump in to each other randomly in like a mall or TJ Maxx or something and they make that really loud excited ""HEYYYYY""? That's what she did to me. She smiles really big and goes HEYYYYYY, and because I too am a girl with real XY chromosomes I of course followed suit with my own because it's an instinctual thing I guess, I dunno.

She asked me how I was doing and I answered honestly -- I was fucking *hot*. There were so many people there, and it's the middle of rainy season here in Korea which means is hot and muggy as hell. She immediately says, ""I know, it sucks, here."" She took the little mini fan she had blowing on herself on the table that she had brought and turned it around so it was blowing full force on me. She said, ""Here, take this, take my fan and cool down."" And of course outwardly I was like aww thank you, you're so sweet, trying to play it cool, but inwardly I was [way more like this](http://cdn1.alloy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Kristen-Bell-crying-from-cute-sloth-GIF.gif)

She asked where I was from and I told her America, but that I live in Korea, and she said whoa, really? That's a big move! She asked what if I was in school or working and I said working, and she spent a little bit asking about my job as she opened my album to sign. She said my name (Kiki) was really cute, and I said thank you and that I like Jennie as well, and Nini of course. She said she liked Kiki more, and I said that's fine, we can switch. I'll be Jennie. And she said ""Nini and Kiki, it has a ring to it"".

Afterwards we had a little extra time to chat at the person in front of me was spending a bit of extra time with Jisoo despite getting mad stink eye from some angry managernims but I told her that I hoped to come to more events if I could and see them again soon and she said that would be amazing! And that she really appreciated me coming and supporting BLACKPINK. I told her that a lot of young women look up to BLACKPINK for being really strong women in the industry and she said that that means more to her than she can say.

Jennie is such a kind, sweet soul. She spent a little bit talking about how hard BP has been working on their comeback and that they have a lot of really great ideas for the future and I said that BLINKS would be there every single step of the way. She gave me a little high five/shakey hand motion thing and she said she hoped to see me soon. I handed her my letter and she hugged it to herself and said thank you and that she would read it that night. What a CUTIEEEE, ugh I love her. I LOVE ALL OF THEM. 

[Here is here page in my album!](https://imgur.com/APSKZUW)

***JISOO:***

Last was Jisoo! Jisoo has always been my bias wrecker, even though I would go to war for any of the four members in a heartbeat, but she has always been so sweet and kind seeming in variety and shows and lives and social media, and she is SO. GORGEOUS. I absolutely adore Jisoo. And wow, every single one of them, all four of them, are just so so gorgeous in person, like literally so stunning. And Jisoo is no exception, she's breathtaking in person. She's got an incredible, warm smile. As I got up to her I said hello to her and she bowed her head and said hello back. I spoke in Korean to Jisoo -- I know that the members have said that she understands English quite well, but having been able to speak in English to the rest of the members, I just went ahead and spoke Korean to make it less stressful for her since she said she gets nervous when she tries to speak English. 

Because my Korean is pretty okay, but not perfect, we didn't speak quite as much as I did with the other members, but she was so kind and patient and understanding. If I didn't understand something, she did gestures to help me understand, or used a few English words if she knew them. To be 100% honest I was so in awe of how pretty she was that I think I looked like I had a loading signal on my forehead the entire time, but I do remember that she asked if I studied Korean, and I said I was studying right now so that I could speak to them more and understand their lyrics better. She said that was really sweet and that it made her want to study English really hard, too. I told her that I thought her pink wig in Ddu Du Ddu Du was really neat and looked really good on her and she laughed shyly and said, ""Really? I was nervous that I didn't look good in it."" 

I told her I was so happy to finally be able to buy a physical album to collect and she said she was so happy to have an album as well and that she hopes another one will follow soon. She asked if I lived in Korea, and I said that I did, so I would come to see them more often. Her voice is so soft and kind sounding, I don't really know how else to explain it, but she just seemed so down to earth and... gentle? I think that's the right word. Where as the other three were very peppy and energetic and HEYYYYing it up, she was talking much more quietly and more more intimately. She would lean in closer and rest her hand on my wrist and nod as I talked to her. Man, what a sweetheart. I was so happy I got to see Jisoo's true beauty in person, she really is an amazing person. 

She signed my album and when she looked at the post it with my name to sign to on it, she pointed at the hangul I had written under the English spelling of Kiki and said ""Ahh, this is really good! Your Korean is good."" And inwardly I was like omg Jisoo pls it's like two letters repeated, pls but I thanked her awkwardly as I do. I told her thank you for taking the time to come meet fans and do the fansign and she said that she would do a million more if she could, if that meant meeting more BLINKS. I made sure to give her my letter before going back to my seat.

[Here is her page in my album!](https://imgur.com/soJw1EJ)


When I got back to my seat, I finally let myself breathe a sigh of relief, having gotten through all four members while relatively keeping my composure and playing it cool. I continued to take some more pictures and chat a bit with the person sitting next to me as they went through the sign -- the sign lasted a much shorter time than I am used to with fansigns because the managers were rushing so harshly, but I am still thankful for what I got to experience with the girls regardless.

At the end of the sign, the girls send a few short ments about thank you for coming and for supporting BLACKPINK, and they signed four shirts to give away. The girls each pulled a number to give the shirt's away to, and the number corresponded to your seat number. I was.... JUST A LITTLE distraught when LISA pulled 54 and I WAS 55. I felt so betrayed. [How could you do me like this Lisa?!](https://youtu.be/ptmM-m7Cl8U?t=3s) 

I was really happy for the person next to me, and after that the girls said their goodbyes, took a few pictures of them and the audience off the stage, and made their exit while giving kisses and waving to the fans both in the sign and outside of it looking on.

And that was the sign! A truly unforgettable experience. I was a little bummed about how overbearing and intimidating the YG staff were, and I really hope eventually YG realizes that fan events should stay as just that. Events... for the fans. Not as a publicity stunt or a chance to block everyone's view the entire time taking pictures and video constantly for other stuff but. The issues I had with YG staff didn't even begin to ruin the experience for me. I really hope that the girls get a ton of success and hype and even more love and devotion from their first mini album and continue to have even bigger and better audiences in the future &lt;3 They truly are an amazing group of women who have worked so long and so hard for where they are today, and they deserve more than they get. I'm so excited to see where they go from here.

[As promised, here is an album of a few of the pictures I took at the sign!](https://imgur.com/a/1EoaWD4) I'll probably add more of these to this album in the coming days if you want to keep checking back for more. As with all my fansign accounts I do, my big disclaimer is that I am not a fansite nor a professional photographer so I don't take fansite-quality pictures. But I hope you like them nonetheless!

Also, I sometimes get messages asking me about how many albums it tends to take for certain groups to get in to signs for people who are planning on going when they visit here. For the most recent few that I've been to, I can tell you that LOONA yyxy was about 8, Momoland is 2-3, and for BLACKPINK I bought 20. I was told 15 is the magic number, but since it was the last sign I bought a few more, and when I saw other fans while they were picking seats that had their papers out, a lot of them bought 22-26. I think 20+ from here on out will be the norm.

I hope that you all enjoyed my fan account! I hope to attend more BLACKPINK fan events in the future to support the girls, so I doubt it will be my last. But thank you for reading my rambly account, and please continue to support the wonderful and talented girls of BLACKPINK!",33,235

So I finally got around to watching Burn The Stage and before going on to perform Jimin says that he's never had proper vocal lessons and he asks Jungkook for help. This just got me thinking....WTF Bighit?? Why has no one given Jimin actual vocal lessons?

I mean I get that back when they were trainees BigHit was a small company so maybe they didn't have the financial resources to give everyone top notch training, but now that BTS is bringing in millions I feel like there's no excuse to neglect this. I mean, they've been a debuted group for 5 years (plus the amount of time they've been trainees) yet they've never bothered to train their lead vocalist in vocals? To me it just makes the company seem unprofessional in the way they handle their idols.

So yeah, someone please give Jimin vocal lessons. He does high notes all the time I don't want him to strain or do something that could damage his voice later on, and maybe if he knew how to properly sing he'd feel more confident about his performances. What do you guys think? I don't follow BTS a lot so maybe things have changed and someone can educate me.",1,3

First there was the claim of BP MVs and now Twice MVs playing on other videos as ads and it inflating the viewcount. 

Recently I saw a tweet by tech YouTuber MKBHD: https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1016442181584936960?s=19
Showing that one of his recent videos was being used as an ad and it had become his most viewed video ever.

Also anyone is able to use any video as an ad so even fans can technically make an MV be used as an ad. 

Im kinda neutral on this because it's good marketing and devalues viewcount competition(less drama) but at the same time it seems kinda sketch to then glorify/brag about achieving fame ( I don't know how to word this lmao). Also YT views are factored into music shows. 

Without bashing groups I'd like to hear your guys' thought on this.",53,25

* Blackpink's Ddu-du Ddu-du was averaging consistently 6Mil views a day, yesterday recorded only 1.7Mil

* APink's I'm so Sick was on the 2Mil views a day area, recorded ~600k

* Red Velvet's #CookieJar went from ~500k a day to a tiny 50k (90% drop!)

* Momoland's BAAM from nearly a month of steady 2Mil, got 600K

* Twice's Dance the Night Away opened with 20M, recorded 4Mil yesterday. Statistically, the second day seldom drop below 50%, here we saw a 80% drop.

Did Youtube change some recording system or just bugged out yesterday? any news?",1,5

I've followed them for years through all of the ups and downs. They are by far my favourite group and they've inspired me so much. When times were tough I often listened to their music and persevered with the idea that one day, I might get to say hello and thank them in person for keeping my head up.

These days most of their releases don't gain much traction, and even though they are quite active on social media they aren't getting enough exposure. The 2018 Dream Concert was probably their best shot at getting back in the spotlight but they pulled from the lineup. TRCNG was not pulled which makes me wonder what happened.

With everything that's happened with them I find it hard to believe that they would sign another contract with TSE. The recent happenings with Hyoseung of Secret claiming she hasn't been paid since 2015, along with Jieun saying she will not be returning to Secret,  it's solid in my mind that the days are running out.

I'm so stressed because I want to continue hearing their music; however, I also want the best for them and I hope that they can be freed from the mistreatment they've endured for years. 

No matter what, I will support all of them and the paths they decide to follow should they choose to disband.

The Eve was the first kpop album that I heard and is the reason im here (in the kpop world). I liked so much that I make my sister listen to it but weeks later I started to delete the songs from my playlist and now I dont listen to it anymore :(
With Move I was so impressed but now I cant remember the songs.

Add an album that you keep listen after 1 year (o more) so we can check it out.

Ps. Im not fluent in English so sorry for any mistakes and this is my personal experience based on my taste (dont get mad)

---
In a sweeping defeat, r/kpop sings' Third Digital Single, the Song of Summer, will be a cover of Red Velvet's [Red Flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyiIGEHQP8o)!

Of the 472 votes, *25% of them were for Red Flavor*, so it was honestly barely a competition. I'd have screenshots for yall but excel is being a turd on my work computer and I want to get this done while I'm technically getting paid to do it, so you'll have to take my word for it.

2nd place was Sistar's *Touch My Body*, and 3rd place was *Shake It*, as expected.

&amp;nbsp;

As of the moment this post goes live, we are **officially opening submissions**! Submissions will be closed in two weeks, on **FRIDAY JULY 27th**. We're trying to make this round be actually time conscientious (because it sure would suck if the song of summer came out in December), so the likelihood of extensions this round is slim. Please try to submit on time!

#HOW TO RECORD AND SUBMIT YOUR VOCALS

Follow these steps and save us all a lot of pain please. If you already know how to record your voice, skip ahead to step 7.

**Step 1.** Download Audacity (or open Garageband if you're on a Mac.) If you don't have a phone or computer that has a microphone, borrow one. Ask nicely. More specifics on recording with Audacity [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hvurc/project_ranime_sings_colors_by_flow_code_geass_op/?st=j9westlp&amp;sh=fdeb6d0e), via /u/IbrahimT13.

**Step 2.** Get some headphones, preferably ones *without* a mic, and plug them in. We want to hear **ONLY YOUR VOICE**. If the headphones have a mic, make sure your input in the program is not set to that channel.

**Step 3.** Open the Red Flavor music video ([THIS ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyiIGEHQP8o)) in your browser.

**Step 4.** Open this page to the Romanised Lyrics (from [Colorcoded Lyrics](https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2017/07/red-velvet-red-flavor-ppalgan-mat)) If you want, you can sing along to [this lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUwHblpMX1M) instead.

We will have an official romanized version soon, so stay tuned for that!!

**Step 5**. Put those headphones in your ears, hit record on the software, hit play on the music video, then *sing your heart out.* Remember that kpop groups are multiple people. It is not possible to sing all of the lines in immediate order without losing breath or doubling up, **so do a bunch of takes.** If this is confusing, the easiest thing to do for this song is to record each member's part as a separate track. Basically DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF. 

**Step 6**. If you want to do harmonies or adlibs, please record those as a SEPARATE file and include them in the email. Again, DON'T SING ON TOP OF YOURSELF. It's alright if you send us 3-5 different audio tracks! We like choices!

**Step 7**. Save your masterpieces as a .wav (preferrably in 48kHz), .m4a (preferrably 256kbps or higher), or .flac file and email that sucker to redditkpop101@gmail.com. 

If you found this stupid and confusing, [here is a video tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBMhf53SSC8). If you're still stupid and confused, DM me.

**Some general recording tips.** (Adapted from /u/IllllllllI's post).

* If you found a lot of noise in your recording, please leave a 20 seconds gap of silence so the editor can get a good sample of background noise. It's hot in the northern hemisphere right now, so if you can stand it, try to turn off any loud air conditioners or fans.

* If you love the idea of this project and want to contribute long-term, consider buying a little standalone USB microphone. I can personally vouch for the quality and durability of [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-iCE-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B014PYGTUQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517946380&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=USB+microphone&amp;dpID=31Ju5HK-6bL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=srch) for basic use. There are cheaper options on amazon now, but I'm not familiar with them. The editing team will thank you.

* Don't sing too close to your mic - it causes clipping/distortion.

* If you have the resources, consider making a [quick pop filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Ut4s4ME8Y) for your mic. It'll sound a jillion times better and we thank you for it &lt;3.

* Higher notes are easier to sing if you sing confidently/loudly and with good breath support.

* If you have to go screamo or shouty to hit the notes, back away from your microphone please. It's easier to make quiet vocals louder, than louder vocals quieter. (I personally recorded the majority of Wolf from about 10 feet away.)

* You can *absolutely* include you doing the weird distorted chanting sample in the chorus. 

* Boys and low-voiced ladies, you're more than welcome to sing an octave down! If you don't feel like you can hit some of the notes, it's okay! Despite the Produce 101 mentality, there are actually such things as different vocal ranges. 

* In general, this is not an easy song to sing, but please don't get discouraged! Take deep breaths, have lots of water on hand, keep your soft pallet raised and try to imagine the sound coming out of the center of your forehead. Remember, *at least it's not Wolf*.

* And most importantly, **HAVE FUN WITH IT, YALL**.

#**FAQ**:

**Q**: I live under a rock, what is this?

**A**: This is r/kpop sings! It is a community project inspired by the super successful [r/anime sings project](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/sings). The community nominates, votes for, and then records themselves singing a kpop song of their choice, which is then edited and released by the r/kpop sings team. Anyone can nominate and vote, and everyone is encouraged to sing. Check out our previous songs on our [youtube channel,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI88hA7Ne76ebCbK5Xh-PTQ) and follow our [tweeter for updates](https://twitter.com/redditSingsKpops).

&amp;nbsp;

**Q**: My friend from twitter/tumblr/school/fanforums wants to submit, is that allowed?

**A**: Sure as shit is, just tell them to sign up for a reddit account, because it's r/kpop sings, not ""various people sing"".

&amp;nbsp;

**Q**: Oh boy oh boy I can't wait to hear the song! When will it be finished??

**A**: *Hopefully before summer is over!!!* No concrete date for finalization, but look for teasers to start up about 2 weeks out from release.

&amp;nbsp;

**A**: Can I call dibs on the part where--

**Q**: NO DIBS

&amp;nbsp;

**Q**: Can I do the ad-libs?

**A**: Heck yah you can! Send 'em the fuck in! No guarantee we'll use them though, and this will hopefully be quite different from Wolf in that we'll ideally have many more submissions and be able to create a more choral sound. It'll hopefully never be the case again where there are single voices doing single parts, but that will always be at the editor's discretion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q**: Yall are amazing, is there anyway I can help??

**A**. Name the fandom! kpoppers was suggested, but that's been used by a few youtube channels, and is of course, this subreddit's counterpart's name. Let's see if we can't get a bit more creative!

Super excited for this yall. Thanks again to our amazing editing team, the wonderful r/kpop mods and the community for being so enthusiastic. Break out those blue oranges and let's have a [fun summer, yall!](https://imgur.com/a/6Avn0KA)

Nugu girl groups like Momoland have become breakout successes this year, (G-)I-DLE saw major success on debut, while others like Sunmi,  Red Velvet, Twice, BlackPink, GFriend, Oh My Girl, Lovelyz and Bolbbalgan4 cementing their place as top tier artists. We've also seen so many girl group subunits debut from Pristin, OMG, Gugudan and others.

Just as an example, of the 26 Inkigayo broadcasts in 2018, girl groups have dominated with 18 wins over 26 shows. The remaining 8 wins were by boy groups Infinite, iKon, Winner and BTS.

With maybe the exception of 2014 where girl groups like AOA, EXID, APink, SNSD, Girl's Day, IU, (f)x, Girls Generation TTS, Sistar, and Ailee were top of the charts, I cannot recall a year like 2018 where girl groups have had such outstanding successes.",118,450

I like it better than running or other types of cardio, and I typically will dance along to kpop dances. I haven't been following kpop much in years, so most of the dances I do are for older songs. I'd love to hear what you all do and maybe find some kpop dances to incorporate into my routine!

Currently, my favorites are;

 Crayon Pop - Bar Bar Bar

 Girls Day - Twinkle Twinkle

Twice - Cheer Up

Wanna go ~~GIRL~~ review some songs but not sure what to do or what this is? Read here! Jukebox is a feature on r/kpop where you get to review seven songs each week. Listen to one or all seven, and then leave a review for however many songs you listen to! Feel free to say whatever you want about the song  as long as you are not attacking the artist or being intentionally inflammatory, any disapproving criticisms (or conversely high praises) are welcome. Alongside your review, please leave a score for the song **between 1 and 10.** _Do not leave a score less than 1 or greater than 10, otherwise I will not count your review or score._ If a song has an [MV] tag in front it, you can review the MV for that song as well, but thats totally optional!

As a reminder, I do not choose songs if they are randomly picked (screenshots will be provided in the Other Business section below). If I pick a song, I will explicitly tell you so  and here I am telling you that I picked Lee Hyori's 'U-Go-Girl' to appear on this week's Jukebox. All songs chosen via randomization are done so using [random.org/lists](random.org/lists). Summer songs appear on Jukebox via your submissions (see Other Business section in the comments below). You have all week to participate and comment on songs. Please try and have your reviews in by next Friday at 8:00 PM PST (for conversion to your timezone, [click here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html)!)

1228,2018-07-16,2018,7,16,2,8z3dst,180707 MOMOLAND S-Plex Center Fansign,kikistiel,1531676037,"Hello everyone. Im back with another fansign write up, but one I wasnt originally going to write... Ill tell you why. 


This time it was Momolands 180707 fansign at S-PLEX in Mapo. I originally wasnt going to do a write up of this sign because it was cursed as I put it originally, and never really expanded on that, but for reasons other than the girls. I decided to finally write this after some buzz Ive seen online regarding Momoland. Specially Nancy re:Blackpink. This sign happened shortly after the incident with BP on the same day. So, I wanted to give a little insight. 


As you guys know from my blackpink fansign account, I am a huge massive loving BLINK. But, I also adore Momoland to the ends of the earth. And I finally decided to write this account in response to the controversy surrounding Momoland and Nancy, from the perspective of someone who adores both groups. As such, my account is going to be a little different from my past. Instead of spending a lot of time on interactions I had with each member, I wanted to delve in to the girls themselves at the sign as whole as I observed them from my seat. I plan to attend another MMLD sign in the future and will continue to do a more traditional write up there. 


When I first got there Id heard rumblings that Nayun would not be in attendance because she was sick. Yeonwoo is my bias in Momoland, and Id heard she wouldnt be there as well, but there was no confirmation anywhere. Even on twitter or the fancafe. It made me think that if they didnt end up attending, it was a last minute decision. 


I had a great seat that overlooked all of the girls and there were 9 seats set up and ready to go, but as the girls arrived and walked out on stage, both Yeonwoo and Nayun were missing. I was momentarily really sad that Yeonwoo wouldnt be there, but as soon as the girls walked in to the room, I noticed a really big change in the feel of the room itself... usually when the artists arrive, its to much fanfare and excitement. But these girls came in and it was dead quiet. And I could see why. 


Nancy came in first, and she was wrapped in a blanket. And she was moving quite slow and lethargically. Even JooE was lethargic and looked dead on her feet, tired as hell. They entered with no announcement, no music playing, didnt say anything until they sat down. JooE and Hyebin spoke first, and the immediate words out of JooEs mouth after a hello and their introduction was . ... .


Im sorry everyone. We are not feeling well.


Mind you, this was long before Id heard anything about Nancy and Blackpink. I didnt hear about Nancys controversy until the next day AFTER my fansign with Blackpink. 


JooE was very quiet when she said this. The line up from left to right was Hyebin, Taeha, JooE, Daisy, Ahin, Jane, and Nancy. Everyone told her it was okay and we were happy they came, and that they should take care of themselves first. 


I remember the first words Id said to my friend that I sat next to, someone who had been to every single MMLD fansign since their debut... God, they look *miserable*. 


He agreed. 


I felt so awful watching these girls try to get through this sign. They were trying so hard. JooE tried to pep herself up but she was honestly the loudest in the whole room. You could hear her conversations even from my seat in the 50 numbers. All the Other members were just that quiet.  Out of all of them, Hyebin seemed to be doing the best, but she still looked exhausted... Daisy was wearing a plain hoodie over her uniform because she was obviously freezing. Janes hair wasnt even barely done, almost like she had been sleeping in it? (Shes still gorgeous though!)


The one I was the most worried about was Taeha. I have a huge soft spot for her, and whenever she was talking to a fan, she would try her best to be all smiles and hold their hand and sign but you could tell her head was swimming. Not even exaggerating, every time a fan got up to move down she would lay her head in her arms like she was about to sleep or be sick. She would look up at the ceiling and blink rapidly to try and focus. One time a manager came over to her and asked her something and she looked like she was saying she was okay. She didnt look like she didnt want to be there, she just looked so, so unwell. I was legitimately afraid she was going to pass out. 


This was the atmosphere in the room for most of the sign. It was really awkward and hard to bear being there for so long, because they took so much time with each of their fans. I was number 51 or so, and when I went up, I was nervous about meeting them when they were obviously feeling so under the weather. But, I pressed on. 


I had hurt my ankle on some stairs that week and was wearing a large, cumbersome ankle brace. As soon as I made my way towards Hyebin, she looked so concerned and asked me if I was okay, what happened, etc etc. She was so sweet (I have a lot of feelings about how underrated I think Hyebin is. Shes so kind and gorgeous and talented). Hyebin and Taehas English is probably the most nonexistent in the group, so I spoke korean with them. But Hyebin was so kind and I asked her if they were doing well and getting lots of rest. She said they were okay. 


Taeha looked so pale in person. Her eyes looked very tired, but she still tried her best to be personable with me and have a smile on her face. She even looked a little clammy. If she was this sick and she still came to the sign, I cant even imagine how sick Yeonwoo and Nayun must have been... I asked her if she was doing okay, and she said she was doing better now. 


JooE was bubbly and her normal happy go lucky self, but very toned down and quiet. Her voice was even a little hoarse, like she had a scratchy sore throat. I asked if MMLD was looking it for themselves. She seemed to brush this under the rug, kind of the same feeling I got from all the members when I asked, like they werent really supposed to talk about if they werent feeling well. She kind of changed the subject to the post it I had prepared and that she liked my name. 


Daisy seemed very tired, but she was still very kind and even staved off the scary managernims when she took extra long answering my post it. Daisy is such a cute bean in person! Shes so tiny all over and so gorgeous and sweet. Shes also a huge nerd about stuff too, which I love. 


Ahin was next. Out of all the girls, she seemed to be the most healthy and okay. She asked me how my day was going and I said I was really happy they made it here even if they werent feeling well, and she said she wouldnt miss it for the world. My post it had asked her, whats your biggest dream for MMLD and the fans? She answered To have a concert . I told her if MMLD had a concert, Id be right there in front row, cheering the girls on. She was very appreciative. She told me that she prefers being called her English name, Cindy, when talking in English, which I thought was cute. So, from then on at the sign I called her Cindy. My new friend Calvin was right behind me in line and she said she liked My and Calvins names a lot. 


Jane was next, and wow what a beautiful girl! So talk and pretty. Shes got an incredible smile. She seemed to be doing well despite obviously not feeling too well, and she tried her best to communicate in English even after I told her Korean was okay, haha. I think as far as English goes for MMLD, taking out Yeonwoo and Nayun, it goes:


Best: Nancy, Ahin, Daisy (obviously)
Pretty good: JooE, Jane
Not very much at all: Hyebin, Taeha


After Jane was the resident maknae Nancy. Poor Nancy. She really wasnt doing well. She was obviously running on very little sleep, and she seemed exhausted. She still put on a very brave face and tried her best to pick her energy up, but she was clearly tired and needed a good rest. I remember she had walked in wrapped in a blanket, but here she was in her short sleeve cheerleader-esque uniform clearly freezing in the venue... I asked her if she and the girls were doing well and how promoting was going and she said they were tired but proud of their work and what theyd accomplished. On the post it is asked her to teach me her favorite word in Korean. She chose  or cutie! Like, calling someone adorable or a cutie. She even did a little small jingle, that gwiyomi song? briefly. 


Towards the end of the sign, the girls energy picked up a bit after theyd finished signing and played around a bit on stage. At first Taeha didnt come up around to the front for ments, and I thought she was going to head out for not feeling well.  Eventually she did come up to the front, but she sat in a chair, tired. Hyebin, Jane, and JooE interacted with the crowd, and soon Nancy, Daisy, and Ahin joined in, seemingly having gotten a second wind from being able to get up and move around. Taeha, too, eventually even got up and played a bit. The games were lighthearted and less physical, like playing a counting game. If someone lost, they ran through the audience. Or, well, they werent *supposed* to. JooE started to run through the audience but a manager didnt want her to do it. Then she kinda... did it anyways lmao. She looked pretty happy with her rebelliousness, too. Nancy ended up knowing she was going to lose and preemptively took a run through just to beat them to the punch! 


The girls, having gotten a little bit of a boost of energy, had so so much fanservice to give. they loved talking to members in the audience, responding to shouts of love and adoration and such, or returning hearts. My friend shouted CINDY I LOVE YOU and Ahin responded by screaming back I love you Calvin and Kiki! 


I was so shocked she had remembered our names! What a total sweetheart. 


As the girls were leaving, I made sure to yell words of encouragement to poor Taeha. She seemed really happy and gave me some hearts as she left.


I wish I could I could give more details about the girls in person and the sign like I normally do but again, not only was the mood of this sign very somber and quiet, but I wanted to make the true focus of this sign until I attend another to be how tired these girls were. 


I didnt hear about the Nancy vs BP drama until after Id gotten home from Blackpinks sign the next night and I was really disheartened to see how people werent giving Nancy any slack... shes such a young girl who is trying so hard. Rookie and not as popular groups really have to promote long and hard to get recognition, but bigger groups do maybe four or five signs and call it a cycle. Momoland had done their music show that morning and the day before that had done another fansign and show... 


Sometimes, fans have knee jerk reactions to things they see and they dont have the proper context or knowledge of what these people are going through. I was so sad and shocked to see that their management had made them do this sign when they were missing two members and half of the girls left looked like they might be sick right then and there... I just wanted to wrap them up in a blanket and give them some chicken noodle soup. And to think that Nancy was in hot water over that? I could see how down and unwell she was in person with my own two eyes. A lot of the people ranting from behind their computer screens didnt even know Nancy hardly until this thing happened. 


I wasnt originally going to write this fan account but after seeing the backlash at this sign and seeing how hard people rag on idols for stuff they perceive to be true and use confirmation bias to back it up... I felt like I should make sure that out of all my happy and excited and great fan accounts, I owed it to the fandom to show that sometimes they arent so happy and energetic. Sometimes the idols are *human* and the cracks start to show, and its sobering to be reminded that the idol world, despite the happy persona they put on, is very much a harsh and exhausting business to be in. And fans tearing others down over nothing doesnt help at all. 


Thats all I have for this fan account. I took some pictures, but I dont know if I feel comfortable posting them because I stopped halfway through because it felt weird to be taking pictures of them when they were clearly not at 100%. I will definitely share pictures of the next sign I attend for them. And I will share post its and better in depth accounts of each lovely girl. Please count on it!


As a die hard BLINK, as well as a fan and supporter of the talented girls of Momoland, I hope that anyone who was in doubt over the excuse that Nancy wasnt feeling well will read this and take a little bit of pity on those girls and cut them some slack. You have no idea how hard these girls, Momoland, Blackpink, any idol group really  you have no idea what they go through on a daily basis. Even when we get small snippets of it, we dont have the full story. We will never have the full story, and I hope that people can think about how their words can hurt others when they blindly tear down another human being for not acting, looking, seeing, thinking exactly how *they* think is appropriate. Korea is not a place thats tolerant of people disrespecting their seniors and whatnot. If Nancy had done something intentionally malicious, youd be sure that she would be reprimanded and corrected for it. I really hope that this fan account sheds even a tiny bit of light and insight on how Momoland were doing that day, and their state in general. They were overall just lovely, lovely girls. And I hope that they continue to gain more recognition and fans. 


Thats all for this fan account everyone. As always, thank you for all of your comments and messages, Im sorry how long it sometimes takes me to respond to each one, but I appreciate all the feedback. 


Until next time everyone. 

Please, be kind to each other.

Cosmic Girls: solid physical sales, no hit songs or breakout members, too many members

Gugudan: on the same level as DIA really

Pristin: pretty huge debut, but We Like ruined their drive

Weki Meki: solid physical sales, digital flops

I honestly feel like DIA, Weki Meki, Cosmic Girls and Gugudan are all on the same level. In the grand scheme of Korean girl groups they are all pretty ""irrelevant"". Pristin is probably the most ""successful"" out of the groups.

Chungha on the other hand has had two massive hits, both almost at 1 million in digital sales and her physical sales are okay-ish. Overall she feels very popular.",230,251

He released his first EP, Take, as a solo artist on June 27, 2018 with a title track, **""""** featuring Ovan () and Sumin, however, another song from the album is getting recognition instead of the title track and eventually hitting the top of the major music charts.

Any songs from the album is nowhere in any of the 6 major music charts for the first 6 days until **""Way Back Home""**, one of the tracks from the album, appeared on Bugs chart on July 3rd with a peak position of **#74**. The song is now crawling to the top on other music charts since: hitting **#2** on Bugs on July 9th, hitting **top 10** in Genie on July 11th.

On July 14th, the song achieved the **top 10** position on Melon after climbing for 10 days, and hitting **#1** in Genie. As of now, it has a peak of **#3** on Melon.

As expected, Naver news about Shaun hitting #1 on Genie received negative receptions and from commenters. ([1](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=144&amp;aid=0000563111), [2](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=108&amp;aid=0002713766), [3](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=117&amp;aid=0003077566), [4](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=011&amp;aid=0003348848))

Honestly, the song is decent good but not a song that can outchart others, especially for an unknown artist, but hitting #1 on a major music chart is such a head-scratcher with these GG releases dominating it.

What do you guys think? Is this another sajaegi incident? Similar to Nilo's?

**Little known fact**: As I looked through his credits, I saw that he contributed some of SM artists like EXO (The War, Concert Album), SHINee (Concert Album) and Taemin (Press It), and on one song with Epik High from their recent album, ""We've Done Something Wonderful""

So I started looking for other websites online but I havent been successful.

One of the websites I tried was kpopmart.com 
at first I was happy because I saw the prices and they were the actual prices that they would be sold at in Korea. But once I decided to check out to see my total I saw that the cheapest shipping was 37$
I did expect to have shipping, but not that much. ( Well Im a student and Im not allowed to have a job yet, so 37$ seems like a lot to me. I dont know about you )

So i was just asking if anyone knows any places where shipping is cheaper and albums are at a reasonable price.

Im trying to ship to California, Im not sure if that plays a role into it.
any recommendations pls :)",12,0

* **$15 per figure at 6"" minimum and 9"" tall max length wise**
* **Drawn traditionally by pen**
* **Sent virtually at no additional cost**
* **Can be sent physically but shipping cost will be added**

If you're wondering about the thread's new format and slightly delayed posting date, please read the [house keeping news](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/85hb07/kpop_monthly_makestar_roundup_march_2018/) for more info.

**Currently Active Projects: (in order based on project end date - given in KST)**

[**HINT Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_hint_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 19, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is HINT?

HINT is a seven member girl group signed to Starpo Entertainment. The group was formerly known as Turan.

As Turan, the group debuted in July 2013 with the song ""[Bang Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfGZ3wYw-60)"". After four years of promoting as Turan, the group redebuted as HINT in 2017 with a tweaked lineup. As HINT, the group's first single was called ""[Tang Tang Tang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In3-Jd6kYEg)"", which was released in April 2017. The group's most recent comeback was in January 2018 with the song ""[Walkie-Talkie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apicwn8bmM)"".

I wasn't able to find too much else about the group in English, but the group does have various SNS pages (which can be viewed [here](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/female_artist_profiles/h/turan-profile/)).

[**MONIKA Solo Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_monika_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 24, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is MONIKA?

MONIKA is a singer signed to Zoo Entertainment. Prior to her solo career, Monika was best known for being a member of Badkidz. With Badkidz, Monika debuted in November 2014 with the song ""[Ear Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyYbLHXgeeM)"". Monika stayed with the group until this year, when she announced her decision to leave the group in March.

Monika's first album as a solo artist (and title song of the same name) ""[Will It Get Better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-wBAKxFtp4)"" came about soon after she left Badkidz. This seems to be her most recent comeback.

She has an active[ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdYI2Jd4-PJV2qscm2j0A_w) if you'd like to check out more of her music.

[**BLACK6IX Mini Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_black6ix_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 25, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is BLACK6IX?

BLACK6IX is a six member boy group signed to Black Hole Entertainment. Their group name is supposedly tied to the idea of a black hole, as their group name reportedly means six boysof infinite possibilities.

The group debuted in April 2017 with the song ""[Please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSfQ-OjlfXk)"". The group's most recent comeback was in February 2018 with the song ""[Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmfhqnlOKhk)"".

I haven't been able to find too much about the group in English, but I was able to find that member Taeyong is a former I-REX member.

The group has various SNS pages, which can be viewed [here.](http://kprofiles.com/black6ix-members-profile/)

[**Chloris Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_chloris_01/)

* Date Project Ends: July 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is Chloris?

Chloris is a four member girl group signed to FAB Entertainment.

Based on a quick google search, I'm assuming that the group's name (and fan club name) is derived from the Greek Nymph of the same name, who was associated with spring, flowers and new growth.

The group debuted in November 2017 with the song ""Friday Night"". Unfortunately, no MV was made, but you can watch a fancam performance of the song [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMDknoN-Ang).

I haven't been able to find too much else about the group in English (besides the typical k-pop stats), but the group's fan club name is Chlover.

The group also has a variety of SNS pages, which can be viewed [here.](https://kpopinfo114.wordpress.com/female_artist_profiles/c/chloris-profile/)

* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is BePM?

BePM is a project group consisting of Musclemania Korea champion DJ J-Locke and Gen 1 K-pop group CLEO's Chae Eunjung.

From the Makestar, it looks like the concept is Fitness EDM. The project is being developed in partnership with Wells Entertainment.

I wasn't able to find anything else relatively interesting about either woman that's not listed on the Makestar, but you can read about Chae Eunjung's now disbanded group [CLEO ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleo_(band))here.

What is *Are You Human?*

*Are You Human?* is a currently airing K-Drama that stars [Seo Kang-joon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seo_Kang-joon) and [Gong Seung-yeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Seung-yeon). From Wikipedia, the premise of the show is as follows:

&gt;Nam Shin ([Seo Kang-joon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seo_Kang-joon)) is a son from a family who runs a large company. After an unexpected accident, he falls into a coma. His mother Laura Oh ([Kim Sung-ryung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Sung-ryung))  is an authority on brain science and artificial intelligence. She  creates an android named Nam Shin III which identically looks like her son. The android pretends to be Nam Shin, and has a bodyguard, Kang  So-bong ([Gong Seung-yeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Seung-yeon)).

As of July 16 KST, the show had aired 22 of the 36 slated episodes. You can read more about the show by clicking [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Human%3F)

Who is SNUPER?

SNUPER, while decently known on the sub, is still pretty nugu, so I'm going to try to flesh out their bio here.

SNUPER is a six member boy group signed to Widmay Entertainment. The group name is supposed to mean """"Higher than Super"". The group's fandom name is Swing. The group debuted in 2015 with the song ""[Shall We Dance?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB6eX7Lc2CY)"" and overall has been...doing okay in terms of sales. Not bad coming from a small label, but definitely still struggling to break out of the C-tiers. 

Their last three albums have peaked at #4 on Gaon, with their highest selling album currently being *I Wanna?* with 23,616+ copies sold via Gaon. So the group's fandom is growing, slowly but surely. Their biggest issue right now is lack of recognition from the general public. All of their songs have yet to appear on the Gaon singles charts. However, the group is having more success in Japan, having their last two Japanese singles peak at #3 on the Oricon charts, selling over \~31,000+ physical CD copies of each song.

The group attempted to boost their public popularity by appearing on *The Unit.* Four members (Woosung, Sangil, Suhyun, and Sebin) auditioned with a frankly lackluster performance of GOT7's ""[Just Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCs_ITVKqtU)"". Only Sangil, Suhyun, and Sebin passed the audition rounds, and made it to the live episodes. 

Unfortunately, the members did not rank very high during their stint on the show, with Sangil ranking the highest at #34. Suhyun ranked at #40 and Sebin ranked at #46. From the looks of things, the show might have given them a minor bump in fandom power, but definitely not the kind of bump they were no doubt expecting. Sangil and Sebin's most notable performance on the show was on Team Green for the performance of 2PM's ""[Heartbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvuLSEwJ1gk)"" while Suhyun's most notable performance was part of Team Blue's performance of Block B's ""[H.E.R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC1L6Pouq70)"".

The group's most recent comeback was in April 2018 with the song ""[Dear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sJf0_7AddM)"".

The group has a variety of SNS pages, of which can be viewed by clicking [here. ](https://kprofiles.com/snuper-members-profile/)

[**SPECTRUM Single Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_spectrum_01/)

* Date Project Ends: August 30, 2018
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is SPECTRUM?

SPECTRUM is a seven member boy group signed to WYNN Entertainment. The group debuted in May 2018 with the song ""[Light It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRi-UiA2-f0)"". 

From looking into things, it looks like the group hasn't had a comeback since then, so this Makestar would be for their follow up to their debut song.

Since the group is pretty new, I wasn't able to find too much else about the group besides basic idol stats. Though a few interesting things to note:

*  Member Hwarang was a trainee at Noga Entertainment, and was slated to debut in the (still undebuted) group LUCENTE under his name Jongchan.
* Member Dongyoon appeared on *MixNine* and placed a respectable 21st. His most notable performance was as part of team Gangnam Station Exit 10 with the song ""[Super Freak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbWxa7u98Y)"".

The group has various SNS pages (including individual member instagram pages!), of which can be viewed [here.](https://kprofiles.com/spectrum-members-profile/)",1,22

What BTS should focus on is to get an vocal coach that can proper help them gain more control and technique over their voices, which in the long term will help the health of their voices.

1436,2018-07-18,2018,7,18,5,8zopas,When something gets popular,_Viken__,1531858724,"\*This is my personal opinion and I would like to hear your two cents of it in the comment\*

With the trend of ""unpopular opinion threads and videos have an opening for people to hate on other groups opened, here is my thoughts on the topic. 

I started liking Kpop in 2010 and have seen a lot of groups become popular, I have also seen what said growing popularity does to certain groups. As I guess most stans in this community are rather young I will be conduction this discussion with these two examples BTS and Blackpink since they are more relevant in today's age.

BTS and Blackpink are both groups that recently has gained a lot of new fans, both internationally and nationally. With their fast increase in fame has also a lot of hate towards these groups arrived. Many people use the term ""overrated"" to describe these groups. def; \*have a higher opinion of (someone or something) than is deserved\*. What these people are saying are that these two groups do not deserve their fame. In my honest opinion this is very wrong thing to say, since we all know of the harsh treatment of idols in the industry and how hard all these groups work to gain popularity and to get the chance to debut, and that they all deserve what they get.

If we were to look at it from a business perspective the groups might be ""overhyped"" def; \*make exaggerated claims about (a product, idea, or event); publicize or promote excessively\*. Especially in bangtan expirence we could say they have gotten overhyped in american media and BP might have gotten overhyped by new fans and/or the media, however by no means are they overrated in my humble opinion. 

I think the criticizing of the groups might come from fans of other groups that rather want to see their favorites in BTS or Blackpink's position, which is 100% understandable however do not make your action of hate towards certain groups ok. To clearify I dont have anything agaist giving groups constructive criticism, but just stating someone do not deserve their fame is not constrictive at all. I stan multiple groups e.x BTS, EXO, Pentagon, Stray kids, day6, Twice, RV etc.. but never could i get myself to hate on groups I myself personally doesn't stan and I  just find these comments very childish and unnecessary.  

Thank you for reading my little rant :3  Love \_Viken\_

What are your thoughts on popular idols attending/not attending college, whether it's while promoting like OT9 Yoona/Sooyoung/Yuri or after they have taken a break or called it quits on life in the public eye like ex-Wonder Girl Hyelim? Do you think idols, whether popular or not, should attend college to have (and this is my reasoning, please feel free to add your own) a fallback plan? A Plan B, if idol life doesn't yield the results they want it to yield.

I wouldn't see the point in someone like Taeyeon attending college because she is already getting vocal training lessons in SME, is born with a stellar voice and has the quantity of fans to support her solo career while also the quality to bring in new fans (unless she is/was interested in pursuing a different career path) but someone like Yoona/Sooyoung/Yuri who want to explore acting and can get the benefit of college classes, the brand name of the university they graduate from (leaving out the part whether or not they attend their classes regularly) in addition to the acting lessons SME provides.

Please don't feel restrained to answering the questions I've put forward because I want to know what the y'all think about Idols and College in general.",38,52

Favorite examples are ZICO [Artist ](https://youtu.be/e9TWzuKXZNc), as alot of the lyrics are about not taking life too seriously, RV [Happiness ](https://youtu.be/B7qh8lXrxss) and SEVENTEEN [THANKS ](https://youtu.be/xs6hQ_mriW0). [CLAP ](https://youtu.be/LJU35jteVu8) can also fit into the category somewhat.

I made this post because I think that this could have happened to others too. 

One of the things I thought it was true is that the big3 has better groups and better music. At that moment my only resource for info about kpop was the comment section of YouTube. I saw a lot of discussions about big3 groups saying things like SM has the best vocalists, the best visuals,etc. I really believed all of that and now that im more into kpop I found all of that funny.

Other: the importance of the positions like you dont see directioners talking about who is the lead singer in 1d. ",55,31

i dont know how many people will be able to actually answer this question but i thought id give it a try anyways.

so its clear fansites use professional dslrs and other hella expensive cameras but what do they do when the venue has a policy that means no cameras other than on your phone? 

i went a concert with a complete no professional cameras policy (im pretty sure nonprofessional cameras are not allowed either) that afterwards i saw extremely high quality pictures of on twitter etc. do they bring in the cameras anyway? (id imagine that would be pretty difficult but i have read that some go through security and are just told to put it in their bag) or do they have some alternative with their cellphones? 

im really wondering about the cellphone part cause im going to another concert in september and my phone took awful pictures at this last one.

i mightve written much more than necessary but thanks a bunch!

""Total tour attendance = 272,000 approx.

Average ticket price = Assumed at $100

Total revenue = $27,200,000

Assumed costs = 70% (Really highballing)

Net Profit = $8,160,000

SM Share = 35% (Its actually 30% for overseas stuff)

GG Share = $5,304,000

1/8 GG Share = $663,000""

But then this is the SM profit distribution:

Events: Company (60), Artist (40)

Overseas promotions: Company (30), Artist (70)

Are concerts in Korea considered ""Events""?

1580,2018-07-19,2018,7,19,19,904op6,On the toxic and vile culture of 'Koreaboo-ism',1000nipples,1531996185,"There are so many issues I have with the acceptance and encouragement of Koreaboo culture in Western fan pages. Firstly, loving and surrounding yourself in Korean music, film, food is not what I have a problem with- I too love Korean music, food etc. The attached image is from a Facebook group where behavior like that is entirely commonplace. Multiple people would speak out against it, and have their comments and posts shut down by mods, and that's a general trend I've noticed in many fan-pages.

What I have a problem with is where girls (and to a lesser extent) guys fetishsize any Korean citizen simply for being Korean. The attached image is a perfect example of how damaging this behaviour is and why I'm calling out mods and fans directly for allowing this behaviour, even under the guise of a 'joke'. This guy is in a relationship, and who just wants to enjoy a band with other people who do, and yet is being fucking harassed because what? Because he has monolids, facial features common to regions of East Asia??? Can none of you see how absolutely vile this is??? 

Rule 2 of this group in particular is as follows: ""... degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated"". Treating an Asian like a fucking trophy because you love Asian culture, harassing a man because you're (quite frankly) a brain dead human is the epitome of ""degrading comment\[s\]"" based upon race. So please explain why so many posts centered around fetishizing race are allowed and encouraged. Outside this group, it doesn't take long for you to find some image of a crying woman with the caption ""me when an oppa walks by in public"" etc. It is widely accepted that treating women like trophies is extremely sexist, and is something that few people tolerate. So why is it okay to use the same principle for Asians???

Furthermore, I have noticed posts calling out this gross circle of Asian circle jerking are deleted as soon as. Why is that? Yes they receive great amounts of attention, and most of this is negative because those who feel attacked by the truth simply cannot see beyond themselves, but deleting something instead of allowing people to be educated just reinforces toxic behaviour. A lot of the people who sink that low into Koreaboo-ism tend to be underage girls- bruh you are 12 and haven't had a period, relax and stop screaming at random Asians online about how you want them to choke you. Go play with dirt or smth. They are the first to point fingers at the toxic Asian fans for cruelty (rightly so) but won't take it when they get called out for fetishising asians and their toxic behaviour towards other kpop fandoms? 

And finally, not to delve too deep into the semantic behind this culture, but the fact you people think that your harassment of Asians is acceptable is telling of grossly internalised white superiority. You think that this behaviour is acceptable because you chasing after an Asian is something they would want, because you are under the impression that white girls are the dream partner that Asians desire. (hi imperialism and colonialism are over get outta here with that shit)

I don't really catch up with theories regarding GFriend's MVs that much, and I don't pay attention to theories in general, but after watching Sunny Summer, I've managed to collect some bits &amp; pieces from the MV to come up with a little theory of my own. There might be some stuff that I missed out on here &amp; there.  Please correct me if there's anything I missed out on. 

Anyways, this is my theory. Enjoy!

For starters, I would like to direct your attention to the ['Time For The Moon Night' MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XyBa8QsVQU). 

As most probably would've known, 
the most popular theory for TFTMN is that Eunha has passed on &amp; that the members are mourning her in different ways. Keep note of this as it's a key factor to explaining theory to how this 2 MVs are connected.

**Similarities of both MVs**

While Sunny Summer is a stark contrast to TFTMN, I managed to note down some similarites between the 2 MVs:

* [Around the 30sec mark of both MVs, Eunha is seen interracting with a fish in a fishbowl &amp; fishtank in a similar by tapping the glass](https://imgur.com/gallery/NsAowKn)
* [At the 41sec mark of TFTMN, Umji is seen launching a paper plane. At 2:19 of Sunnny Summer, she does the exact same action](https://imgur.com/gallery/LA9zQ64)
* [Yerin is all alone and gets surprised/spooked by the members](https://imgur.com/gallery/MZTpIxm)
* [To continue the point above, in the same scene of both videos, a white dreamcatcher is seen in the background](https://imgur.com/gallery/dHUMFRi)

**The Shakespeare Theory**

Two excerpts from 2 of Shakepeare's Sonnets are mentioned in this MV. [Sonnet 43](https://imgur.com/gallery/M0M8i5k), which is seen at the start of the video, and [Sonnet 18](https://imgur.com/gallery/JqQuPeR) (seen briefly at 1:18).
While most might overlook 2 excerpts as just merely background text used for the sake of the video, there's actually something deeper going on in correlation withthese 2 Sonnets. 

**Sonnet 18**

Let's take a closer look at [Sonnet 18](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/18detail.html). The
Sonnet is about a speaker asking whether he should compare an individual to a summer's day, and how the said individual will live on forever in the lines of the poem. The poem starts of as a light-hearted sentiment of becoming one with the summer, but further into the poem it talks about
despite death, the memories of an individual will live on in any way shape or form. 

While the summer overtones of the poem seem rather obvious, it is the later half of the poem that struck a chord in me. The last 3 lines of the sonnet describes how the passing of someone won't be seen as a way of forgetting someone, and how one's legacy will live on in different ways. In which, if we back track to the Moon Night MV, the members are mourning &amp; remembering Eunha. Most notably Yerin, which is seen holding a cassette player &amp; tearing up while listening to it.

Seems oddly specific for them to include a poem about a summer's day that also talks about how one's life shall always be remembered even after passing. Coincidence? Maybe.

**Sonnet 43**

Let's take a closer look at [Sonnet 43](http://www.farlimas.com/Shakenew/sonnets/paraphrase/sonnet43p.html). This one in particular highlights the speaker's yearning for his beloved and sadness of their absence. Seems odd that they'd reference this in Sunny Summer right? The 2 lines seen in the intro, when paraphrased reads ""Till I see you days are nights, and nights are days when I dream of you."" While the said line is seems out of place in the MV itself, it definitely fits the somber mood of Moon Night with the members missing Eunha and vice versa. This could also make sense with Fingertip, as Eunha is seen asleep and is seen going thru dream sequences thoughout the video. 

[**Sonnet 27**](http://www.farlimas.com/Shakenew/sonnets/paraphrase/sonnet27p.html)

While this particular Sonnet is not mentioned in any way during the MV, I was informed by a fellow friend that this Sonnet may have ties to this MV as well. 

This poem talks about an individual who is seeking sleep but is struggling to as his mind is filled with thoughts of someone new. And how the new person in his life resembles a jewel shining in the dark. In Sunny Summer, [Sowon &amp; Yerin are seen showing off their shiny jewel earrings, while Eunha in one scene is scene holding a Diamond](https://imgur.com/a/yo9Q9dm). 

**Closing Statement**

From my perspective, Sunny Summer would most probably be either 1) a dream sequence that happened  before Moon Night took place, where Eunha is still alive &amp; well with her fellow members beside her. 2) This took place before Eunha passed where everything is as it is OR 3) Eunha is in Paradise, and this takes place after Moon Night where the members are somehow able to make contact with her(Sowon sketching a holiday poster, Eunha looking thru the diamond as a way of communication with the members, Eunha's fishtank got significantly larger &amp; more decorated, a sign that she's probably found peace). 

What are your thoughts about this? I hope my so called theory might be worth a read. This is my first time doing such a theory, I hope it's not too bad. Also, this is just a theory and its not exactly 100% accurate, there might be some pointers that I might miss out. If there's anything worth adding on, please do share it in the comments. (Fellows mods if this is not an appropriate post, I'd take it down ASAP)

Thank you for your time! ",2,13

I have no problem with that, and I also know that a lot of groups talk about their struggles as idols and more personal stuff, but what songs do you think have the strongest messages (both new and old)? I started thinking about this after reading into the lyrics of BTS's ""Go Go"" that pretty directly criticize the Korean for being careless when it comes to money and not caring about their future. I like music that have strong messages and groups that want to speak their mind. So what are your thoughts?",54,42

Mine faves are (in no particular order):

1. Selfish - Moonbyul feat. Seulgi (Not technically released in the summer, but it was included on MMM's Red Moon album so I figured I could still include it. Also, a chill, meaningful song that includes my two ultimate biases? Yes, please!)

2. Egotistic - Mamamoo (This comeback is absolute FIRE, and I am here for it! WOW!!)

3. Sunny Summer - GFriend (A true summer bop from one of my fave girl groups. So excited about this one!)

4. Aitai-Tai - Red Velvet (I am honestly here for this electropop jam from RV. I feel like I listening to a Perfume song every time I hear it, which is DEFINITELY a good thing!)

5. Bad Boy [English Version] - Red Velvet (Another technicality. I was not prepared for this to happen at KCON, but I sure am happy it did! I honestly catch myself singing the English lyrics over the original version all the time. Here's to hoping for a formal studio release! Love, love, love!!)

Those are probably my top five so far, but there is still plenty left to come, including the ""secret"" Red Velvet summer album that has finally been officially announced! I am excited to see what songs everyone else has been enjoying this summer.",18,0

However, the one song that finally sucked me in was [T-ara's ""Why Are You Being Like This""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ACmeSP-Aes). Not sure why, it was so catchy and I think T-ara was the second group that I learned the members of after SNSD lol.

I had to create a summer playlist and of course I had to make a lot of it K-pop! I have a few western songs for variety. The 32 playlists with the most followers win prizes and the competition ends on August 11. The 2 top prizes is a $500 Ticketmaster gift card and the playlist being played at 8,000+ Starbucks stores. I would really be grateful if you follow my playlist. I really want to show everyone who walks into our stores how beautiful K-pop can be. Its no secret that on Twitter, the person who runs the Starbucks account is a BTS ARMY, so I think they would be thrilled to have my playlist played in stores.

(https://youtu.be/PL9iMPx9CpQ)

Alright so, Vice just shot and created this documentary about the surrounding controversy with EXP Edition and I wanna know what you guys think.
But watch the video first please. Making ignorant comments without actually understanding shit is why America is full of dumbasses right now, lets not be those kinds of people. 

That being said, I was always on the fence about this group. Not sure what to think, but this documentary really made me think about why I didnt accept them earlier on. Theyre genuine, real, talented, and pursuing what they love. The documentary also gives a voice to those who opposed EXP Edition, so it doesnt seem like it was too biased in its creation. 

My thoughts:
Cant argue about their dance being not so great, but theyre one of the only groups in k-pop who all sing live(I understand thats easier when their choreo is less challenging) and are accepted by both the korean community and other k-pop idols/celebrities. They worked with two different famous MV directors for both of their MVs have been on korean tv shows that only people who are exceptionally good at singing can go on(Immortal Songs, Phantom Singer 2, I can see your voice), and have shot tv commercials with Super Junior, BamBam, etc.

That being said, I feel like most of my arguments against their existence were just other peoples thoughts I adopted without caring whether or not theyre right or wrong.  Thats a pretty sheepy way to live, so fuck that.

1735,2018-07-21,2018,7,21,14,90mxt7,"Some songs 'grow' on you, but what 3 songs from 2018 had you utterly hooked on first listen? (Please give reasons)",frehas,1532149389,"* [BTS (V) - Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8npDG2ulKQ)

I was floored on first listen, didn't expect the minimalist backing track to captivate me so much. The pulsing chords drew me in and the emptiness haunted me sending chills down my back. It's almost jazz-like in the sense that the band is selflessly supporting the soloist (V) to stand out during a wicked solo (except this solo is the whole song)

* [Taeyeon - Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjAl0SM3Fc4)

The wrapping chord progression during the chorus gets me every time. Similar to singularity there is a minimalism here with instrumentals and more-so the drums; it makes the listener focus more on the vocal+piano relationship, both of which are spot on. Her voice has just the right amount of breathiness to emphasize longing during the 2nd chorus/outro.

* [Red Velvet - Bad Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_CFBjAyPWE)

My ears tuned in to the funk bass line immediately, it's groovy as heck. The playful push/pull relationship between the high synths and the vocals, Oh god don't forget the crazy high hat skipping around the beat.

[DEAN - ""AND YOU (OUTRO)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUssyXYA_VQ)

I really like this style. Songs that are slower paced, with melancholy instrumentals and lyrics. Low key, no huge high notes or crescendos. **Instrumentals are electronically filtered/glitched (voice might also be filtered for style).** The artist sings about something emotionally draining and sounds like they are breaking inside. (No happy upbeat love ballads!)

So I just got a [private message](https://i.imgur.com/uPgNECI.png) asking me to send them live performances of Girls' Day - Expectation because their friend lost a bet and has to dance to it now.

The thing is, I got this exact message from a different user on an old, now deleted account.

The first time I got this message, I didn't think anything of it and helped them out. Sent them some youtube links to performances. Didn't think anything of it, especially because they responded back and it was a totally normal conversation. But this is weird. It's word for word the same, I specifically remember them using 'hehe'...

I unfortunately don't have a copy of the first time this was sent because I deleted that account over a year ago now.

Has anyone else gotten this message? Is this some like weird scam or what? I'm just kinda confused.

Edit: So it seems like this is probably leading into some weird scam or strange fetish thing. If you get a message like this, please just ignore it. They don't seem to send anything back if you don't respond.

Edit2: Okay copy+pasting some comments I read that seems like a legitimate reason why *so many* people got messages like this:

&gt; /u/foxstarry: This is a fishing attempt to lure young people and groom them. Avoid at all costs. This has been happening on Music.ly, twitter, and especially on Instagram. Everyones story here should be enough but there have been people on insta and music.ly that got lured but these people to give revealing videos or posts. That chat people mention is a p*do chat room where they give you malware laced links to hack attempt to hack cams.

Also:

&gt; /u/Yeontan_Sonyeondan: I think it's fishing eventually for private videos, of a sexual nature, probably to blackmail the sender into giving money. As in I think this person wants to groom younger female kpop fans, make friends, get content to upload for sexy websites, and then manipulate/blackmail them out of money or threaten to release the videos everywhere. I think this is either one very industrious person or a collective of people, operating in another country and I would never respond or send them anything. Not one single thing in this email is true.

I'd like to know what girlgroups and boygroups you believe would be easiest to get into the fansigns of, and how many albums I'd need to buy to get into those fansigns. I know for some smaller-medium groups it's enough with more or less 5 albums, but if anyone has experience, it'd be incredibly helpful to have more specific information. 

I don't plan to get into a fansign of a big group (any of the big 3, for example), I'm a fan of MANY groups (aprox 50) so I'd rather place my money on something I can secure more surely than on a 1/1000 draft. I know many groups won't be holding fansigns while I'm there, by the way! But just in case, I'd like to know as many names as possible since it's good to know which ones to look out for. 

PS: I definitely wanna try to get into LOONA's ot12 fansign since I assume they'll do one once they debut. If anyone wants to estimate how many albums that'd take me, I'd be very thankful!",1,1

Personally, its a tie for me between BAAM by Momoland and Egotistic by Mamamoo. My favorite song, however, is either Latata by (G)I-DLE or Egoist by Olivia Hye.

ZN is working with Laboums comeback as well as doing events with Uni.T, but the group itself seems to be falling off. Until they disband, I believe theres another comeback? But I just dont know how The Unit will work out if theres a second attempt at it.

Members over there seemed to like it, so I thought you might find this cool to look through/discuss as well! (**Disclosure: I wasn't sure whether this type of post breaks any rules on here after looking through the guidelines, please feel free to remove if that is the case.**)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Produce48/comments/914zn4/potential_pd48_group_composition_based_on/

I posted the TLDR for those who don't want to read through the whole thing:

#TLDR:
- Looking at past ranking data for the final I.O.I &amp; Wanna One members show an interesting trend that could be potentially applied for the PD48 contestants. 
- From the past 2 seasons, **at least 50% of the group were already ranked in the top 11 online after Episode 1**. A significant number of final group members (80-90%) were already in the top 15-20 by the first rankings announcement. (If you dislike the Starship trainees, you're probably gonna have to get used to them.)
- **The second ranking (Episode 8) is crucial for final group hopes the past two seasons:** 90-100% of the members were from the top 15. From the data, it is highly unlikely for someone out of the top 20-25 ranked trainees to break into the final lineup. 
- **Therefore, it is highly likely that the final PD48 group will be centered around the top 15-20 trainees as of Episode 5**. If you're favorite is outside that, well, good luck. 
- This year could be different due to: A relative lack of ""star moments"" and name recognition, as well as heavy-handed Mnet editing in favor of lesser known contestants could significantly shake up the rankings.",30,45

1956,2018-07-24,2018,7,24,7,91bk04,"Monsta X World Tour 2018 - The Connect - Chicago, IL",WorkPMThrowaway,1532384040,"Hi All! I'm sitting delayed at an airport, so I figured I'd share my recent experience at the Monsta X concert in Chicago, IL... FWIW: I'm a guy, so advanced apologies for any non-fangirly remarks :)

Last year, I attended the Monsta X World Tour in New York at Playstation Theater, which was my first ever live Kpop.....anything. It was so fun, I decided to make a vacation trip to Chicago with the Monsta X concert being my main piece of itinerary.

**Location &amp; Entry**

The concert was held at the Rosemont Theater in Rosemont, IL outside of downtown Chicago. In comparison to the Playstation Theater in downtown Manhattan, the Rosemont Theater was leaps and bounds better. Not only in size, but location. Rather than being hindered by being downtown, being outside the city has the luxury of space and less peripheral traffic.

Overall, the Rosemont is much more of a traditional theater with seating everywhere (no pit). The line was long as I expected, but they started entry about an hour and fifteen minutes before showtime. There were ushers at every door to guide folks to seats, and the signage was thorough. While there was security, it was minimal and they didn't seem to be overbearing on attendees.

**The Performance**

I had an idea of what I was getting into having been to last year's Monsta X performance, but the group was hype as usual. They of course performed their more recent hits (Dramarama and Jealousy), but also threw it back to their earlier hip-hop roots. Throughout the performance, there were sub-unit performances (ex: Hyungwon and IM, Shownu and Jooheon, and Kihyun/Wonho/Minhyuk). They also broke up the performance with a few bits of silliness like Kihyun doing the famous ""Fortnite"" dance and Jooheon doing the all-too-played-out Shooter dance across the entirety of the stage. As expected, the performance was great.

To talk specifically about a few of the members....Hyungwon looked so happy to be there. Since he was in the hospital for their US tour in 2017, he got a LOT of love from fans. Jooheon was really the star of the show. I wish I had his energy.... Wonho looked really tired and unenthusiastic. I would most likely attribute this to jet lag since they landed the day before and I'm sure did dance practicing and soundchecks the majority of their time before the show.  The group's English was pretty admirable. IM obviously did most of the speaking, but both Jooheon and Kihyun spoke in English quite a bit. 

**Fans**

So I'll admit, I'm not the biggest Monsta X fan. My fiance is and I don't dislike them, so I absolutely wanted to go. I'm much more of a BLINK and EXO-L, but that's neither here nor there. The reason I bring this up is because even if I was a Monbebe, I couldn't bring myself to act like some of these people. I understand the boy group fangirl mentality, but I have to criticize the fans a bit as they wouldn't...stop....screaming...ever. This led to the crowd not being able to easily make out the translator and for the members to have to ask the crowd to chill out a bit so they could speak.

**Final Thoughts**

Great performance....would do it again....10/10 with rice. I'm happy to see the group so happy. If they come back next year I'm sure I'll see them again!",6,80

2047,2018-07-25,2018,7,25,3,91k7ma,Scandals which ended or nearly ended popular Kpop groups,Darling_Lavender,1532458338,"Glam:
&gt;On September 2, 2014, the actor Lee Byung-hun made a report at Gangnam Police Station claiming that two women were blackmailing him by using a compromising video as leverage. Dahee and model Lee Ji-yeon were identified and they have since admitted to blackmailing the actor. The final trial was held at the Seoul District Court on January 15, 2015, and Dahee was sentenced to one year in prison until Lee Byung-hun released her before leaving for the U.S. on March 20.On January 14, the company confirmed the contracts of the members ended at the end of 2014 and the members decided to go their separate ways.

T-ara and the bullying controversy:
&gt;On July 25 and 26, T-ara held a concert in Japan, with Hwayoung only performing one song due to a leg injury. After the concert, one member of T-ara tweeted a general message about determination, and four of the other members agreed with her. Subsequently, Hwayoung and her sister, Hyoyoung, tweeted about a ""bad person,"" which gave Korean netizens the impression that there was a conflict within the group. Netizens retweeted the messages and speculated that Hwayoung was being bullied. When the bullying controversy got out of hand, Core Contents Media abruptly announced Hwayoung's immediate departure on July 30, after being with the group for one year and eight months. CCM's CEO, Kim Kwang-soo, claimed that Hwayoung's contract was terminated because staff members felt her behavior was hurting teamwork, and the bullying controversy was not the reason for her departure. The controversy caused the group to temporarily suspend activities, while the members continued with their individual activities. Both Hwayoung and the other members of T-ara have said that facts about their bullying issue were made-up by netizens, but on the other hand confirmed there was in fact a conflict between Hwayoung and the other members.

A bit of background, though, to help recs go in the right direction:

Basically... my KPop experience is *damn* limited. I mean, I literally only listen to one artist - BoA. I do love her work, with Atlantis Princess, Girls On Top, Hurricane Venus, and ONE SHOT, TWO SHOT being my favorites of her Korean work (of her Japanese disocgraphy... I'd say VALENTI, LOVE &amp; HONESTY, and WHO'S BACK?, though I also liked the experimentation on OUTGROW a lot, too).

Well... I also love ""Wedding dress"" by Taeyang, though his other solo work didn't quite click with me. I might re-try him, though.

Basically, I'm not TOO big on the boy band/girl band craze, in Korea or Japan. I prefer solo acts - bands and groups *may* be okay if their line-ups are consistently stable (for a Japanese example, I really like Perfume and Do As Infinity a lot, too).

My tastes are pretty broad - pop/R&amp;B/hip-hop/dance, obviously. Rock, maybe more experimental stuff as well. I'd also prefer artists who at least have one full album out, if not more (mini-albums... they're okay, but the propensity of them in KPop that I've seen is kind of aggravating).

For more reference to what kind of music/artists appeal to me, if there are some similar in KPop, some of my favorite JPop artists are Ayumi Hamasaki, Hikaru Utada, Mika Nakashima, Miliyah Kato, Namie Amuro, Mamoru Miyano, Angela Aki, Kana Nishino, and Chihiro Onitsuka. I'm also a fan of alan's Japanese work (haven't tried her Chinese stuff yet). And BoA is obviously someone I really enjoy. Crystal Kay's cool, too.

So, yeah, if anyone could give me a few suggestions in the KPop field, it'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",4,0

2066,2018-07-25,2018,7,25,9,91mzo5,Groups who rose to success gradually?,djdjowgjmbs,1532478434,"Usually, the only hope for a completely unknown group to rise from a mid-tier/nugu agency is through a viral moment (aka EXID/Hani) or through one member gaining popularity (BtoB and Sungjae, Momoland and JooE, Apink and Eunji) or through members appearing on a survival show ( pretty much just Nu'est for now), but I wanted to know if there were any groups who rose to get their first wins and higher brand recognition just by sticking it out and releasing their music constantly?

Two groups that instantly come to mind are Seventeen and Oh My Girl. Now I know Seventeen had a pretty huge fanbase pre-debut, but their first two singles didn't chart on Melon at all. They rose because people liked their music and they had very innovative choreography. Also, the self-producing angle really helped them. I wouldn't say Oh My Girl is on Seventeen's level, but their recent comeback did well on the charts and they've been climbing steadily just by constantly promoting and having a steady stream of comebacks.

'did they do anything wrong?' and  proceeds to say she does not wants me to unstan them, asks me to put their vids, tells me that I must 'miss' the guys, etc.

I personally really liked them, and while ive listened to Kpop for awhile now, all groups that Ive been into have already been well established before I started listening. Because of this Im really not familiar with newer groups/ ""necessary schedules"" for them to keep building a fanbase when starting out, and I was wondering whether the long wait will really hurt them assuming they do make a comeback this year, or if this type of situation has happened before?  

Elris also debuted last year, which I quite liked. The gap between their 2nd and 3rd mini album seemed quite big to me (6-7 months i think?), but they seem to be steadily growing. This is why I was wondering if it would really make much of a difference",75,89

(Throwback to before there was a such thing as a line distribution video)

For example there was a time when people were obsessed with live mr removed videos and they would get millions of views. The whole video concept started as a way to see if idols were lipsyncing or not. In the past few years theyve gotten less popular because fans started realizing that pre-recorded vocals are a thing and that using those videos with their garbled audio as a way to measure vocal talent is just stupid.

What are some examples of fan content that has had their rise and fall? Any predictions for the next trend?",136,115

To put it bluntly, I really hate how some of the fans exaggerate the success these boys have. Dubbing them the world's biggest boy group to have ever lived is the dumbest comment I've ever heard. That's just pure delusion, and it most likely never will happen. To call them talented, is an understatement, however, they don't even begin to compare to the biggest legends to have ever walked this Earth such as the beatles and even Jackson 5. 

I don't want to burst anyone's bubble, but BTS falls into the Kpop genre, it isn't Kpop itself. 

Calling them the biggest boy group is kind of sad considering that a lot of boy groups outsell them in terms of album sales and they're already long gone and were here before streaming and music videos were a thing. 

So please pay respects to the other boy groups, and pay attention to all of KPop not just BTS, even if you're just gonna broaden your view, I'm not gonna lie I don't listen to all of KPop sinde I'm not into girl groups, but I dont focus entirely on BTS.


PS; I love you BTS. ",6,0

2215,2018-07-26,2018,7,26,18,920tb5,The Worlds Most Controversial Kpop Group,SprtWlf,1532597767,"https://youtu.be/rse0HGWdZ68

There are important elements to kpop and this includes the groups trainee days. Teenage boys and girls are brought in to go through hellish training and then put in a group during this time. The bond that forms between the members during their training period doesnt go unnoticed in a traditional kpop group. If they were younger and had gone through a more similar trainee stage they may have gotten a better reaction.

While it isnt something people want to say or hear, I think race contributes to why many foreign fans dislike them. Its not so much bad as it is strange (at least for me as a foreign fan of kpop) to see 25-30 year old white guys being called kpop. For me, Kpop is inherently Korean. Thats what Ive come to know and love; Korean boys and girls dancing and singing and being generally awesome and lovable people. For a Korean person, however, Kpop is just that, pop music. So in their Korean fanbase, the members being foreign AND white gives them an edge with the fascination thats expressed from those fans. American guys in Kpop is something new and interesting theyve never really seen before. But for foreigners its almost (or is) invasive into this strictly Korean culture theyve come to know. Western pop is absolutely nothing like Kpop so western people entering the scene is like breaking the fantasy world open; putting in some of the same when western fans wanted something different from their normal.

Im not going to hate on them but I will say it is quite strange, odd, and a bit off putting to see them considered a Kpop group. Good for them for trying this and actually gaining a fanbase! Though, the reality (I think) is that they are going to be TOO different to be as successful as some of the other groups. Being with such a small and inexperienced company doesnt help, either. Good luck to them, though Im not sure yet if I am a fan.

[here](https://gugudan.jp/) it includes an official fanclub subscription (free for now), that gives you access to some exclusive contents and privileges as getting tickets for their incoming activities early. talking about those, they announced two shows for September 21st in Tokyo (first one being labeled as a showcase and the second session as a fanmeeting) and a japanese debut cd (including their four korean title tracks released until now), that will be released in September. not much info about it for now, but I get a feeling (judging by a survey available there) that they'll add some japanese version later. or who knows, maybe it release separately afterwards. 

anyways, that's pretty big for the group that had so few overseas activities until now (in Japan, for example, they only came once for the Kcon earlier this year) compared to their peers. which is kinda of a waste, considering they have some members that actually can already speak japanese (particularly Hana) unlike most groups.

I brought a BTS magazine a while ago and it is all in English, hence being published by an American magazine. It is mainly about BTS, but there is one section where it introduces other kpop groups like Red velvet, Seventeen and of course, EXO. It also introduces GOT7 however, the picture in the slot does not look like GOT7 at all. I asked a friend of mine who is a big Got7 fan and she confirmed that the picture is not Got7.

This isn't the first mistake that the magazine had. Apparently they had mixed up Suga's and Jimin's height, unless Jimin actually grew taller but none of us know. Judging by the mistake on television where they mistook RM as late SHINee's Jonghyun, it isn't surprising that America doesn't do research about kpop beforehand, which is one thing I believe they should do.

Back to the magazine, I examined the picture in Got7's slot and was able to make out two of the clearest faces. It looked remarkable like EXO's D.O and Kai. I'm quite a big EXO fan myself, but I'm still not very educated about their 'hair colors' or 'eras'.

I personally think that CLC's Sorn would absolutely flourish on a show like ASC or another regular MC-type position. She's clearly shown great engagement skills via her Livestream/Video Series-- plus the girl knows 4 languages The languages she knows being Thai, Korean, English and one of the Chinese dialects, could easily allow her to be an amazing international kpop show's host.                        
To repeat myself from the previous thread, I still think HyunA does much better in a solo setting due to her insane amount of charisma.                      
(Ironically in my post as well I mentioned TIFFANY getting a stronger solo career to suit her range, and now look where we are. ;) #TiffanyYoung2020)",64,39

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/south-korea-is-trying-to-stop-overwork-by-limiting-the-maximum-workweek-to-52-hours  
https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/07/371_251549.html  
https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-officially-drops-its-maximum-workweek-to-52-hours  

&amp;nbsp;  
JYP mentioned about this in his recent talk in SparksLabs Demoday.  
https://youtu.be/08257W8sdNs?t=15m21s  
Turn on CC btw, he's speak english but on certain times he answer in Korean.  
&amp;nbsp;   

My thought / question is this.  
Previously the max working hours is 68/week.  Assuming on 5 working days, it give them 13.6 hours/day, but let's just say it's 14 hours/day.  
(5 working days is just relatively speaking, we knew the artist / entertainment industry is not bound by the normal monday-friday workday)  
Also, actually S Korean started a 5 working days in 2004 to give you perspective.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Anyway, with the new law, is down to 52 hours, it give them 10.4 hours/day.  
So in other words, it save 4 hours of work per day  than the previous practice.  
That's huge.  

&amp;nbsp;  
But it got me thinking :  
&amp;nbsp;  

1. Are those applies also  to artists as well?  After all, they are an employee.  
I don't see reason why there are some rule exempting artist from this.  
Think wider, not only the artist, but all the staff.  

2. What exactly is a working hours for an artist /staff ?  
We knew many stories, factual based that many artist schedule were tightly packed, day-by-day, especially during comeback.   
3. Only a time where they perform / filming / making an appearance ?  How they calculate that ?  
4. Does it include traveling hours ?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Let say they have 3 event to attend, each on opposite corner in Korea (or even overseas).  
Let's say they technically they only perform for 1 hours for each event.  
This is including preparation (backstage, make up, rehearsal, audio check, etc)  
&amp;nbsp;  
But the traveling time to each event is 3 hours long.  
Which means, they already working for 9 hours just for traveling alone.  
Think wider, this is also applies to their team (manager; that driving the car) is certainly include *driving as part of their job*  after all.  
4. Does it include *waiting* hours  ?    
We all knew, the only reason they have to get up very early in the morning is because the huge number of artist  that needs to do make up.  
Some rookie /unpopular artist even have to go at 1 AM to KBS Music Bank, do their make up, then wait 6-8 hours before the show started filming.  Some even have to wait 12 hours before their turn.  
It's pretty common for artist to sleep on the chair, some group even bring floor mattress to sleep.  
Even huge group like Twice do this, 
And the reason why Twice have their own make up room in their dorm lower floor is to cut away those hours.  

&amp;nbsp;  
**This may not be immediately seen as JYP himself mention they have 1.5 years to implement the new rule.**  

&amp;nbsp;  
So i think what would happen in the future is this :  

1. ALL company, no matter how big or small they are, will gonna make their artist do make-up before filming (with their stylist in charge of course),   
(Like Twice did in their debut days, perhaps even today, idk i don't follow Twice that much)  
This is to getting around the regulation. 
It doesn't count as working hours if they do make up in their home / dorm ?    

2. Artist fee will go up, to made up the loss revenue due being restricted to number of venue they can attend in one day.  
Also to cover bigger staff that accompany them (This new regulation also meant as a way to increase workforce)  
Income / revenue thing is actually one of the issue that the common worker worried.  
They happy with less working hours, but worry about the income
They want their income keep up with this less working hours.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Translation for a fans : higher ticket price.  

3. Small media coverage appearance will significantly being reduced (fansign and stuff)  
That 4 hours reduced working hours s really huge.  
Think about it this way, they use to have 4 more hours to fill it with something. 
But now that 4 hours is gone, they need to maximize media appearance more efficient than others.  
Fansign is just fan service only reach a small number of hardcore fanbase.   
&amp;nbsp;  

I'm happy with the new changes, it's always painful to hear the artist collapsing on stage, or seeing them very tired especially on late night radio show.  
Of course there will be some company that will abused / make workaround the regulation.  
At this moment, it remains to be seen until January 2020  .  
But i doubt nothing will change, in one way or another this is significant down the line.  
The current administration is tougher on regulation (or so i hear).  
&amp;nbsp;  
So what do you think about this changes ?

I started with January, and I know that was a while ago, but figuring out what exactly I want this series to be and getting it all organized was very time-consuming (also there were difficulties in my personal life). At the moment I'm working to get caught up, then I plan on releasing these a month or so after their featured month (ex: I'd release July's playlist/video in September). I don't want to worry about anything trendy or charts; I want to make a quality series that would be worth watching 5 years later.

**The Playlist:**

I completely ignored charts. Basically I listened to a shitton of music, weeded out the crap, and slowly narrowed it down to what I feel are strong songs. I tried to be objective/unbiased, and include a good variety. I want to showcase everything the genre has to offer. :)

**The Video:**

This is the first video I've ever made!!! :D I would greatly appreciate feedback and constructive criticism.

The purpose of the video is, for one, they're fun to watch. :p Two, it's for people who want to see what music is out there but don't have time to listen to an entire playlist. I'm also really hoping it'll help smaller artists get more exposure.

**The Author:**

In case anyone's wondering who tf made this.. I'm a late 20s nerd, been in love with music for 17 years. I'll listen to almost anything, from K-Pop to Black Metal.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVKFijb1MAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVKFijb1MAI)

I hope you guys like this! I've worked really hard to make it. Once the K-Pop series is caught up, I'm going to start a monthly Korean rock/folk series (starting from January because I'm stubborn lol).

Hi Everyone ! 

This is my story
Of how I made this complex mashup. 

I want to tell you this story, since the amount of time on this mashup exceeds what I would normally use on a mashup. Kpop mashup is a bit complex because we have to think about the lyrics too. Since I'm Danish/Vietnamese, I rely on the lyric translation out there. 

It took me a bunch of trial and error, asking people around the community to figure out what they wanted to hear.

The result was, Twice, BTS, Red Velvet. 

I then looked at songs that matches or was close to the same key that fits with sunny summer song which the mashup would work around. Speed should be close and key of track should be close to not bit too much and make it sound like chipmunks. 

The song/songs had to have a MV as well, in order for me to make the mashup MV as well. Unfortunately there wasn't a BTS song I felt like matching sunny summer and had same theme. 

THE CHOSEN ONE WHERE:
Gfriend/Twice/Red Velvet 

THE LYRICS
Since I have vacation atm I could fully focus on the mashup, and so I did. The thing that is missing from my mashup is only to make the lyrics fit better together so it gives more of the context. So I have to rely on themes of the songs and lyrics between some transition between the tracks. 100 % some transition doesn't make sense if you are Korean, so I'm sorry for that, because I chose sound over lyrics 

FINDING MY STYLE 
Now a week later I finally finish this long project and the end result is now here. The instrumental part is LIKEY because the speed and beat was exactly what I was looking for, nice dancable tembo with a nice chord progression that is well known. Red Flavor and likey both have a rap part that I wanted to utilize. I then just had fun making different samples to make the track interested. Added effects between transition between the parts. Cute sounds like water drops, rewind sound like What Is Love, Momoland Baam sample, and lots of other ""tricks"" was added. I'm still in the mid of trying to find my own mashup style. 

CLEANING THE SOUNDS
Since the source for acapella and instrumental from the different songs is unofficial, they had to be ""cleaned"" up, which means removing sharp sounds, muddy sounds, and resonance. Some things are unfixable so it is what it is. 

__________________________________________

TECHNICAL PART
To make the mashup possible in terms of ""fitting"" the sound goes: Sunny Summer was pitch one semitone up from E-minor to F-minor, Red Flavor was pitch one semitone down from A-major (same as F#-minor) to F-minor, while LIKEY was pitch up 1 semitone from E-minor to F-minor. 
__________________________________________

Basically I was having a lot of fun making it 

The video took around 7 hours to edit, to make most part synchronized with the mashup, and make it a bit different then the 3 original video. 

Finally after a week with intens work.. The mashup is done!

Ive been stalking this subreddit to find different posts bc Im bored and I didnt find someone asking this so im doing it.

Which 5 songs you would choose from your group/solo to perform if they have the opportunity to be the close act at an award show? (If your group was already the close act then create a set list with other songs). 

For me the set list for HyunA would be like this:

1- Run &amp; Run as the intro

2-Get Outta My House

3-I was thinking of a DART remix to connect the first part with the second part (im not sure)

4-BABE or ICE ICE

5-Lip &amp; Hip with more back up dancers and a killer break dance.

I unfortunately have been really bad about being up to date this week and forgot to post a Jukebox thread yesterday. I am sorry, and here it is a day late. I unfortunately don't have any scores or results calculated, and I don't have anything in preparation for this (I usually pick the songs the day before/morning of, but this is so last-minute so I'm generating them right now) so instead I'm just gonna give you the songs and let's roll with it! Here's the songs up for this week's review: 

1. [Hyolyn - See Sea ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDAqx45Duqw)
2. [f(x) - Red Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv-8-EgPEY0)
3. [NCT 127 - Switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVwxC1t19Lc)
4. [MV] [Crush - Cereal (feat. Zico)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKlPmiG-fak)
5. [KARD - Ride on the wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AZ3BAydZqI)
6. [Oh My Girl - Liar Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNZKqhXCv5c)
7. [Boys Under the Moonlight/Produce 101 - I Know You Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdAvNO2ar6o)

Pretty simple concept: you get to listen to one or all seven of these songs, and then you get to leave a review for the songs you liked! Or perhaps disliked, and would like to leave criticism instead. Whether a criticism or a praise, say whatever you want about the song in your review, leaving with your review a score between 1 and 10. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, that means you can review the MV as well but that's totally optional! Screenshots of all the picked songs will be below!

But, **which agencies best support their artists wellbeing throughout the process?**

**Allowing them to get some sleep, actual breaks, a decent amount of time to relax/unwind, spend with their family and friends, etc.**
Now, again, the industry is very demanding, so this is just about which agencies are better, not perfect.

So, what do you think? 
__________________________________________

To add my opinion...
JYPe is known as one of the 'nicer companies'. In JYP 2.0, J.Y Park highlighted the new building with an organic cafeteria and talked about mental health care provided to artists. Fans seem to like how idols are taken care of, too.
There have still happened a few things here but overall, JYPe does seem to be on the better side.

Then, artists under CUBE entertainment seem to be rather outspoken, which points to the fact that they are actually allowed to and this gives us some information, such as CLC Sorn talking about her trainee days in CUBE's official youtube channel.

However, there's not much information on how much time they get to rest, just things like 'not much' or 'very little'. So it would be great to know something more specific. If anybody follows a certain group closely maybe you can have a better idea by their schedules and activities.

Anyway, I'd like to know what y'all think (the summary of the topic for discussion is in bold above, just in case you forgot with all my babbling) and hopefully this will be useful for anybody who's interested in applying to any agency.

Nowadays, the same video will be subbed multiple times and uploaded to trustworthy platforms. 

I then attempted to inquire about other challenges of her time in kpop and we discussed RVs success. She mentioned the pride she felt whenever the Wonder Girls (iirc?) broke barriers, and now Im anticipating the Bad Boy Eng. Version to have massive potential to impact US radio stations (especially in this back-to-school season) and for the EP to top the Worlds Chart. 

So, older kpop fans, what are some things that you think newer kpop fans will never experience (positive or negative). Reminisce with other fans or start a conversation about what things used to be like. Just remember, be respectful please!",104,98
2488,2018-07-30,2018,7,30,11,930e4s,Fanaccount for SMTOWN 2018 in Osaka - 180728 (Day 1),maplemarble,1532918754,"My friends and I drove from Tokyo to Osaka from Saturday morning and back again on Sunday just in case the typhoon proved bad enough to rain out public transportation. The drive was really nice but anyway!! I was in decent arena seats so the view was pretty good, though not air conditioned or ventilated. I almost passed out from heat exhaustion.



- NCT Dream opened the concert. I don't know much about them but I was glad it wasn't 6 straight songs by Kangta which is what happened in 2015 and that alone made me like them more LOL



- Lucas is a lot taller than I expected 



- Amber rocked our world. She came out with blue hair and I lost some of my life tbh. Will be sad if (when??) she leaves SM. She was struggling to read the MC prompt in Japanese Luna took over very lovingly exasperated and they both mentioned how it's too bad not all f(x) members could be there :(




- Taemin remains ethereal beauty. He could wear a potato sack and still have angelic light burst forth from every pore



- For the solo dance stages, I was SO happy to see Sehun getting out there and killing it. I do think he's an underrated dancer in EXO and in general (which I understand, since Kai and Lay really draw the eye and get a lot of focus). Was really sad they didn't put Yunho in there because it's been a minute since I've seen Yunho have a pure dance stage



- Yuta, despite being the only Japanese person in all of SM, despite being in Osaka, his hometown, didn't speak first when it came time for NCT to speak. I laughed tbh, everyone was going through their memorized MC scripts really well (Taeyong and Jaehyun sound great!) so when Yuta started speaking I was like, ""wow! This person's even better!!"" It was Yuta. Lmfao bamboozled 



- Red Velvet has great music but seeing them perform at this SMTOWN was really lackluster. They were half-assing the dancing/singing except Seulgi who tried hard and it made me really sad because Red Summer is my summer anthem :( Maybe they're just still uncomfortable singing in Japanese? I don't know. Also Cookie Jar is not a song I enjoy haha



- Was worried about Suho's wellbeing since he's been so busy as of late but he looked fine, if a bit tired :) Always love when he messes up in Japanese because the other members tease him hahaha. Wish they had done Love Me Right on a purely selfish level



- This was my first time seeing Shinee as 4 since Jonghyun left. It wrecked me much harder than I had been expecting tbh. It doesn't matter what group you're a fan of, literally everyone rallies for Shinee. What's there to not love? It warmed every surface of my heart to see Key teasing Onew and Onew laughing and being the weird grandpa he used to be, and Taemin also teasing Key and Key being a loving doting playful hyung back to him. Their dancing remains so on beat, although I was having a surprisingly hard time grasping that they were doing formations with only 4. I don't know, I think I still need time maybe



- Everyone cheered to see Ryeowook back :) HE HAS THE CUTEST SMILE. I don't think that'll ever go away with age. Siwon mentioned it's been a really, really long time since he's been here to perform for us, and the mood was rather serious? I didn't make any connections until two Japanese fans behind me were like, ""ahhh it's probably the dog incident"" and I was like ...oh :x Donghae's hair is deeply confusing. He is such a good-looking lad, why does he have that hairstyle?? Hahaha



- I literally counted the minutes but basically a little past the 3-hour mark, TVXQ finally came out. lksfjlkJFLDKS every other group had different stage outfits but Toho had full pearl red suits and I just felt so beloved to be a fan! Since the dome was so poorly cooled, they were sweating so so so much. Changmin was literally glistening with it and even Yunho was sweaty. Their Japanese also sounds so good after so many groups were awkwardly stumbling through their memorized, generic scripts. Changmin's poison tongue made an appearance when he was explaining that it's been a while since he and Yunho have been at SMTOWN as two, and we were intently listening. He expected us to scream I guess so when it was mostly quiet he said, ""...what, I guess you guys aren't having fun then?"" LMFAO THIS ASSHOLE



- Yunho completely messed up the lyrics to the second verse of ""We Are."" He sang over where Changmin should've been singing until Changmin started making really pointed faces and singing the correct lyrics and Yunho did a literal OTL on the moving cart HAHAHAHA. They're so asldkfj precious. It happens to the best of us Yunho. I wish I could link a fancam here of Changmin's reaction but the girl who had it privated her twitter :(



- Bittersweet af watching Amber and Luna not only do 4 Walls, but Hot Summer!! Luna's arms are outrageous tbh, she is solid pure muscle mass



- BoA remains goddess of SM




- TVXQ closed out the concert (as expected) with The Chance of Love. It was absolutely mindblowing seeing them do it live. I've always wanted to hear them do korean songs in Japan but they never do since 1) it's Japan and 2) their Japanese discography is massive enough to choose from as is. My friend and I SCREAMED the fanchants at the top of our lungs. It was disappointing how freaking quiet the dome was? I'm not sure if it's because Japanese fans are less familiar with the Korean releases or because they just aren't confident to do fanchants for a Korean song but it was too bad, honestly. It was a fantastic performance to end with and they sound sexy af singing in Korean 



- Shinee was the last group to leave the stage as usual. It made me almost start crying again when the ENTIRE dome started chanting ""SHINEE! SHINEE! SHINEE!"" as Shinee stood together to wave goodbye. I've never witnessed something like that hapen at a SMTOWN before. They are so beloved. They are so loved and I hope they can all feel it 




- [Here's a shot I took of the ending](https://imgur.com/a/zcwsBOf)



That was all fun stuff. Some strange? Unexpected? stuff:



- SNSD did no songs. ZERO. Not even a medley. I was shocked, honestly. Taeyeon, Yoona, and Hyoyeon all had solo stages, which is fine, but considering the legacy of the group, I can't believe there wasn't a single Soshi song. Really sad and disappointing--can't imagine how SONEs feel. Sunny and Yuri weren't even there?



- I can understand why Tohoshinki did their new single ""Road"" since it's a new release but what a boring song to do for something like SMTOWN. Actually, TVXQ, please just get better music in Japan disfusdidsidf. Also, if not at SMTOWN, will I ever hear Mirotic again ever? (distant sobbing)



- Why no Baby Don't Stop? People were losing their shit for Ten! As they should!



- Who decided to put TRAX immediately after Toho? So many people immediately left to go to the bathroom :(



- Why no Yunho for the solo dance stages? Why was Irene so half-assed about her dancing? 



- Wendy is so skinny it startled and concerned me :/





- WHY DOES KYOCERA DOME NOT HAVE PROPER VENTILATION. I had to sit down through half of Suju's set because I was so dizzy and I didn't want to pass out. I hope the next SMTOWN will have a Tokyo date because at least Tokyo Dome has real AC



And finally: I got Jaehyun's trading card so if anyone has Yunho's and would be willing to trade, please hit me up ;)



Thanks for making it this far &lt;3",34,109

2575,2018-07-31,2018,7,31,11,93ahy2,Question about EXP EDITION and Alex from BP Rania regarding their 'training'.,FriesWithoutKetchup,1533003764,"First, I'd like to start off by saying that I was a fan of Alex when she was in BP Rania, and I'm still a fan of hers now. I totally supported her being a full-fledged K-Pop idol even though she was a 'foreigner'. The same applies to EXP EDITION - I've been a fan of them from the start (although I did have AND still do have criticisms of them as far as their dancing/aesthetic/etc. are concerned), and I totally support them being an all-foreigner K-Pop idol group.

Today, I got to thinking... I'm well aware of a lot of the criticism that EXP EDITION gets with regards to the training they did to take part in the K-Pop world, and that some people feel like they're not 'real' K-Pop artists because they didn't train under a Korean company from the time they were 10, slaving away and suffering like 'every other K-Pop artist'.

Personally, I find this argument to be incredibly silly since there are plenty of Korean-born K-Pop artists who didn't train for years and years before debuting, and who didn't suffer horribly before debuting. While that may be the 'norm' a lot of the times... there are clearly exceptions that are made sometimes, and if those Korean-born idols who only trained for a few months or a year or so are still considered to be a part of K-Pop, it seems incredibly hypocritical to me to say that EXP EDITION aren't given the same consideration. Especially considering what I've seen of them since their debut as far as them training, improving their dancing, learning the language more and more, immersing themselves in the culture, being incredibly respectful, etc.

I also personally think that a lot of people seem to conflate 'they're not good at what they do' with 'they're not K-Pop/they shouldn't be allowed to participate' - those aren't the same thing at all. Thinking that they suck is one thing, if that's your opinion and your personal taste, then it is what is is. More power to you. Someone not being good enough for you personally... doesn't invalidate them as artists, or mean that they don't belong and they need to leave or cease to be as a group. But with that, I really just wanted to get my two cents out there. That's not the main focus of what I'm talking about.

My main question is... well, I see this kind of argument thrown around as a way to discredit them. Because they didn't come into K-Pop the 'right' way with the 'right' amount and type of training, they don't count.

But... correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Alex also come into K-Pop in the 'not right way'? To my knowledge, she didn't train for years and years under a Korean company and suffer like so many K-Pop artists did. From what I remember, I thought she was just kind of plucked out of America and put into Rania as a new member in a very quick way. Yet from what I've seen (and I'm willing to admit I could very well be wrong or misinformed here, so if I'm wrong please let me know), she never really received the same criticism. And if she did, it was nowhere NEAR the same level as EXP EDITION's criticism regarding this issue.

So... why was it not a big deal that she was just added to a pre-existing K-Pop group without the 'proper training', but when it comes to EXP EDITION it's a huge deal that totally discredits all of their efforts?

Again, I'm a fan of BOTH of them and I had NO real problems with either of them being a part of K-Pop or calling themselves 'K-Pop'. I was all for it. Sure, I had criticisms of both and I thought there were areas were both definitely needed to do better or do something different, but that never made me think that they didn't 'belong' or didn't 'deserve' to be considered a part of K-Pop. Alex was a K-Pop idol, EXP EDITION is a K-Pop idol group, and they both deserved to exist as such in my opinion.

This is really only focused on the criticism of EXP EDITION's 'training', not the many other criticisms they garner - I'm a fan of them myself and I can agree with some of the criticisms against them. This one in particular, though... seems really hypocritical to me when put up against the fact that Alex didn't seem to receive a similar volume or degree of criticism, as well as the fact that there are Korean-born K-Pop idols who ALSO didn't go through the exact same rigorous and lengthy training that most idols appear to go through.

I'd just like to get some thoughts from other people, and from what I've seen of this reddit, it seemed like a more reasonable, fair, and objective place compared to some of the other K-Pop centered websites I've seen.

I'm not looking to get into any arguments with anyone, or cause any offense, or anything of the sort. I'm just curious because this has been on my brain for a long time now.

And also, if I'm mistaken about anything regarding Alex's training or how she became a part of Rania, please let me know - I'm well aware that I could be misinformed or not be remembering things properly from back when she debuted.",15,3

2582,2018-07-31,2018,7,31,12,93atl6,People who hate on cutesy concepts,geekygirl_211,1533006490,"I don't get people who hate on cutesy concepts. And I don't mean as a preference but people who think is objectively bad.

**It's misogynistic**, this is usually coming from western fans who claim (as far as I read) that girls acting cute/playful/innocent goes against feminism (which is (quote) girls acting bold, strong, tough). I'm not a feminist but I am a woman, and this sounds like toxic feminity and gatekeeping. Why can't you be a happy empowered woman while doing and liking cutesy concepts? There's no evident contradiction other than obvious cultural bias towards western music, which does not somehow prove that cute concepts are misogynistic when it itself has so much over sexualization yo become famous. While in kpop cute concepts, girly and sexy can reach fame. But I'm western music it's almost expected to be so sexual (which is basically degrading because it suggests to reach the top you NEED to use body)

It's kind of rich when if anything is downgrading to women it's saying that to be successful and empowered you HAVE to be sexual and fierce. It's really narrow minded to compartmalize things like that. Also living in the West I get tired of ""toxic femininity"" basically imo this idea women *need* to be rebellious, challenging, fierce to be considered empowered. It gets so overbearing to the point where it feels like the only way to be a strong woman is to be problematic and aggressive. Again I'm not trying to say all western feminists are like this nor am I anti feminism just saying that there IS a lot of this. Atleast in cute concepts you don't feel as exploited, don't feel pressured in showing your body etc. It's okay to be gentle, okay to be sweet, okay to be cute, just as it is okay to be fierce, tough and badass.

One reason I switched to kpop was because I was tired of seeing overtly sexualization and objectifying in western music. I like sexy concepts in kpop, but in western music it's just so in your face sexual it's really tiring (not all but many).  There is nothing anti women in being shy, innocent, quite, reserved, cute etc. You don't NEED to be fierce, vocal, outspoken etc etc to be empowered.

Kpop is a business after all. The reality is that stars need to listen to what their company says, especially if it concerns their safety and image to the public. Both males and females have equitable restrictions and that's more of a business thing which isn't the point of the post.


The last criticism of cutesy is that it caters to older men and has a certain pedophilic touch to it. Okay I do understand the concerns, but honestly I think that's a huge stretch. Companies do protect their young artists, safety shorts etc, girls and women enjoy cutesy concepts, boys of the same group enjoy cutesy concepts, and if older men are listening to cute concepts not out of taste but perversion then that's on them for being that way. It's not being catered to them. I can give an example of anime, I do love and watch a lot of anime but there is no denying that the whole loli sexualizing trend can be extremely repulsive to some people, and one reason I don't watch moe or fanservice anime because I can't with implying tiny looking girls are meant to be seen sexy by fans. (I'm not saying all or many anime are like that I'm just saying the anime that eventually make schoolgirls have big tits and panty shots can be *argued* is creepy but you dont see any of that in cute concepts in kpop). 

That's it I hope I did cutesy concepts justice also I'm not saying cutesy is perfect either like to be honest it's really oversaturated and can come off as articifical and cringey etc etc but it's nowhere as bad as some western fans claim it is xx",4,0

No more image making, censorship, and the way Ill talk is gonna be damn REAL without sugarcoating...""",AZUR3WRATH,1533017847,"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3BdsHgt2j/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=4d6d754hbwvu

&gt; In my 10s, Ive learnt to stand up for myself, to unleash the vanity in me, and to walk a different path.
In my 20s, Ive learnt to build myself, to socialize, to survive in the showbiz and jungle-like society. Years of training, learning, hardship, success, and failure brought me to where I am now.
I must say, 29 years of life lesson made me who I am, and yet I have more to improve and upgrade. Most older people told me that Im still young and I have a lot yet to experience, and I agree with that. Its a new stage and Im very excited.
Yes, Im finally 30. I just wanna thank God for the blessings I have so far, and I would like to thank my family, friends, co-workers, fans, haters, for helping me build who I am until now.

&gt; For the first time, and just for once in 30 years, I would like to finally say something daring. I wont regret. I just wanna be uglily real for once. If you dont like harsh words, I advice you to leave now. :) Since Im finally 30, its another milestone in my life and I wanna set things right. Here are few steps I wanna make:

&gt; The FIRST step. I take FULL CONTROL of my life and work. Sick and tired of people telling me whats best for me when they keep f*cking up things. It is time for me to take full responsibility for whatever I do.
One thing I learnt: Trust your own instinct and gut feelings. Trust ONLY GOD but no one. Trust me, its hard, but youll learn to do that.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3BjlGA3cp/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1daci7pu6852l

&gt; The SECOND step. I am NOT a typical Korean idol anymore. Categorize me as a  (adult-dol). What does it mean? No more image making, censorship, and the way Ill talk is gonna be damn REAL without sugarcoating. For example? This food tastes like shit. Dont wow at me. Im human. Time to be real. Well, call me , I dont mind.

&gt; THIRD step. I am NOT here to PLEASE anyone anymore. Complain about my looks, my clothes, my behavior, etc? Do you really think a person can really please the WHOLE world? Of course NOT! So, Im not manly enough? SUCK IT UP, thats ME. Yes I might look gay for you but sorry thats the way I am! And I will say this only once: Im not gay so stop trying to bring me shit (accusations, hate comments, blind items, etc) to bring me down. Like I have to show u a sex video of me with a va jay jay to prove huh? Wont even waste my time justifying myself. Aside from that, whats wrong with being gay? You think people choose to be gay? Stop judging others. You are not God. And only God knows the reason and the answer why. Furthermore, even if I go to a gay bar, so what? Being straight or being gay, people will say the same shit like Hes gay. So sick and tired of it. You know? Some people who stay home could be more lustful or immoral. Grow up. Anyway, conclusion, if you dont like me then sorry that I dont fit your taste, there are many other dishes out there for you, so bon appetit.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3B5kLAEyj/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1kq7kx2qtcmtq

&gt; Alright. Thats all I wanna say. Whether I delete these posts or not, at least my words reached the public already, and you know whats in my head. I call this freedom of speech, my right to be a human even if I am an artist.

&gt; From now on, I just wanna be real. I promised myself to live as a human testimony for God. Im human. No human is perfect. But I will be the imperfect human living out his life to show the love of God. Wont even hard-sell you about Christianity. Will just let you see it yourself through my life.

&gt; For the rest of you who are still here with me, I promise I will work harder to improve myself to be a better man: as a son, a brother, a friend, an entertainer, a Christian. Thank you so much for the past 30 years. Love you all and cant wait to continue my journey together. God bless you, me, us.
