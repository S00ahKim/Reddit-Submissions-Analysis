Or do you not care about that as long as the song is good? I have seen around that self composing groups get a lot more respect. And there is more of a push for them. I know that YG was a big innovator at the self composed idols with Bigbang and now Ikon and Winner. So I wonder if it will be more prevalent in the future.,87,39

NUEST are finally five again! Since they really are my ultimate bias group, there was no way I was missing their first solo concert as all five. I made sure I could take vacation for the days needed, and then the planning could start.  
  
Segno stretched over three days this time, concerts on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I got tickets all three nights, with a middle first floor seated ticket the first night ([view](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D38nUY0UcAEAMYr.jpg)), a side floor seated ticket just by the extended stage the second night ([view](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4BQxWbUwAAWJtk.jpg)), and a standing ticket second row in one of the front pits closest to the stage the last night ([view](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4GBgO0UEAEQZK4.jpg)).  

Ill start with merch and events by the venue, and then describe the concert. So if you are just interested in the concert fan account, please scroll to that section!
  
#####**Before the concert**  
  
One thing Pledis is really good at is keeping fans at the venue the entire day. For Segno, we had four important zones. The merch zone, the rolling capsule zone, the LOVE zone, and the Superstar Pledis booth. Of course I wanted everything.  
  
Friday morning, I arrived at the venue around 7:30am. The merch booth was to open at 9am, and there was already quite the line. A few people after me, someone I knew from twitter arrived to line up, so I let a few people ahead to line with her and talk. I had met her this summer at MCountdown, so it was really fun to catch up! As the line grew longer and staff started to arrive, they decided to move us. So we got to walk two-and-two to a walkway behind the merch booth, where they formed a more organised line while preparing a fenced-off area for the next line.  
  
We had pre-order merch for this concert as well, so the line was not too bad. I had decided to line up since I see it as part of the concert experience and the Korean site was extremely confusing to order from, and the international site did not ship to Korea.  
  
At 9am the line finally started moving, and they took us to the booth in groups. I was in maybe the fourth or fifth group let up to the booth. The line also started to move a bit faster when an express area for lightsticks and voice keyrings opened.  
  
Our group was brought up to the merch zone, and I had my list in hand with everything that I wanted checked. I really love the merch lists that staff hands out at concert, its so nice to be able to show what you want without any language barriers. When there was two people before be in line I suddenly hear sold out. One thing had already sold out! It turned out to be Rens sterling silver bracelet, and a few people behind me in line seemed really upset. Since the bracelets were quite expensive and you could only buy one at a time, I had decided to only get JR. And fortunately he was still available! I got everything on my list and went to find my friends who had arrived later.  
  
Since next booth, rolling capsule, was not opening until 1pm, I decided to head back to my hotel and leave the things I would not need for the concert and also open my trading card packs.  
  
Around noon I headed back to the concert venue and immediately spotted an insanely long line. People were queueing up for the rolling capsule zone that was opening at 1pm. I remembered the lines as moving quite fast once it opened in December for Double You, so I walked around for a bit, hesitating if I should line up now or just wait. Then I ran into another friend who was heading back to her spot in the line and just told me to join her. I felt a bit bad for cutting the line, but with so many people behind me it would be extremely exhausting to line up at the end.   
  
For the concert I had also prepared small [goodie bags](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3uLFWIU4AUIbF8.jpg) with candy and JR photocards I had made with pictures I took at the fansign I went to this summer. I handed it out to people around me in line, and they was really grateful and some gifted me candy and small fanmerch back!  
  
After an hour the line finally started moving. It was really hot that day and while in line I was torn if it was worth risking the sunburn by taking my sweater off. The line moved a lot slower than it had for Double You Final, but eventually we made it to the front.  
  
This set up was a bit more ambitious than the December one. Instead of the oversized capsule machines you had to turn yourself, we had ball drops at the press of a button. If the capsule hit one of the tubes, you could get it from the machine. If not, staff just gave you a capsule out of a box instead. In each capsule was a [key ring](https://i.imgur.com/5iyqvPz.png) with images of each member. On my first try I got Minhyun! I did not get to try more then, as we spotted that the line for Superstar Pledis was already getting long.  
I was able to return later that day, as well as the next day, and ended up with 2 Minhyun, 1 JR, 1 Baekho, and 1 Ren. So I traded one Minhyun for Aron to get all. Then my friends decided that they wanted to go again, and I hesitated for maybe half a second before I decided that I could see if I could get another JR so I could actually dare using it without being afraid of losing it. And my capsule turned out to be JR! It was fate! So that keyring is proudly hanging on my handbag now. 
  
So next line was Superstar Pledis. For people not familiar with the Superstar series, they are phone app rhythm games (guitar hero on your phone) focusing on kpop company series. The Pledis app was launched earlier this year, and for concerts they usually have an event booth where you can play the game and get a prize if you pass a song. I lined up all three days for this booth. The Friday when I got there late after capsule drop I ended up getting the last time slot. The next two days I lined up earlier for Superstar Pledis and manged to get [the first time](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/506765184040173568/566445215351832586/image0.jpg) slot for both days. At the booth, we were not allowed to pick the songs ourself, but instead drew them on folded notes. My first day I got [Love Paint](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/506765184040173568/566179244464406528/image0.jpg). Love Paint can be really tricky, and with my nerves I ended up missing two notes Since I still passed the level I got the prize, which was lenticular photocards by random draw. Once again I got [Minhyun](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D38JzTvU8AEmy25.jpg)! He really liked me that day. The next day I got lucky and got to play a song they havent added to the game yet, [Sleeptalking](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/506765184040173568/566449308270854144/image0.jpg). Since it was the first time I played it I ended up missing notes again, but the beatmap was really fun and Im happy I got to play it! The third day however I managed to pick [Introduce Me To Your Noona](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/506765184040173568/566810966545661954/image0.jpg), which is by far my best NUEST song in the game. And guess what? I aced it! No misses, but I got a few more perfects instead of super perfects than I normally do just because I was shaking so much. I ended up being ranked [1st for two hours](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1117260470329589761), until three people beat me the last two time slots and knocked me out of top 3. Still, it was really fun while it lasted!  
For photocards day 2 and 3, I got [Baekho](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3__T1OUwAA4kSG.jpg) and [Ren](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4FIgw5UEAAnPxD.jpg), but ended up trading them for [JR and Aron]( https://i.imgur.com/SbY6KVf.png).  
    
 The last zone was the LOVE zone, aka the stamp zone. Here you got your ticket stamped, then you got two random photocards and a [stamp card](https://imgur.com/O7EZP6y.png), and then you lined up again to stamp the stamp card with an unique stamp for each day, with [characters drawn by the members](https://imgur.com/9ibHVYY.png). Due to a bit of stupidity and impulse, I had managed to end up with two Friday tickets, and I figured that I at least could use it to get more photocards. So after three days I managed to get [both JR cards, both Aron cards, both Minhyun cards, and then one of each of Baekho and Ren](https://i.imgur.com/Ceuj3bj.png). I was honestly tempted to buy another ticket the last day just to collect all photocards, but it felt like it would be a stupid decision to pay 120.000won for two photocards, so I barely resisted. 
  
After long days of lines and merch, it was finally time to get ready for the concert. The first two days I was seated, so it was really calm to enter and find my place. I had a lot of luck, and had managed to get the seat right next to one of my best friends the first night, and the second night we were in the same section. The third night I was doing standing, and the standing system in Korea is a bit scary. Your ticket will have the number you enter in, and if you are not there when they enter, you dont get your spot. So I was there half an hour early. The girl next to me was super sweet and helped me find my spot. We got shuffled around a bit as more people arrived and found their spot, but I still had a really good number. 
  
  
#####**Concert**

So the concert Since I attended all three days I will do a mix of all three and go song by song. Small disclaimer that Im definitely mixing up details, but will do my best to get things as correct as I can remember them.  
  
As commonly, concert venues play music when you enter to hype up the audience. Segno was no exception and we have a super nice NUEST mix while we waited for the show to start. I believe they had the same mix all three nights, because the last song I remember before the lights started to dim was Big Deal.  
  
With the venue in darkness, the first VCR started to play. We had beautiful mysterious shots of the members, were we the mood was set first with background and props, to then focus in on each member. For each member focus, the crowd screamed. 

The first song was Hello. The members appeared on platforms from above the main stage, with each platform being lit up as that member had their lines. The crowd chanted along with each yeoboseyo. As the second chorus started, the platforms lowered to the stage and the members stepped out towards the crowd. As JRs rap started, the choreo began. Aron had to sit down at a chair in the back for this part, while the other four performed the choreography. At the end of the song, the spotlight focused on Aron for his ending lines, before the lights completely dimmed as the song ended.

As the first tones of Love Paint played, the stage bathed in a purple light. This song was performed as four, with Aron leaving because of the full choreography for this song. Seeing Minhyun open this song again after so long was magical. His voice fits this song so well, and with ease taking all those higher notes that Baekho and Ren used to split between them to try to cover Minhyuns range.  
  
Next song was Overcome. As usual when NUEST perform these two, they tend to come as a pair. Seeing them performed one after each other live, it is so clear how much these two songs are connected. Again, Minhyun has some amazing lines in the song (including mahaken da peupeldomoon) that it was amazing to see be sang by him. And the woah woah woah woah during the bodyrolls that they had always left as a background song even when they performed as NUEST W Finally Minhyun was there for it. We all screamed during the bodyrolls too of course, as always. 

After Overcome ended, the members lined up to greet the audience with the first ment. Aron also returned for this, and we got to see their full greeting Showtime NUEST time, Urban Electro Band NUEST! The third day Baekho accidentally messed up the timing, and they decided to re-do the greetings again properly. After the group greeting, they all introduced themselves individually. Again with Minhyun He was first out and the screams when he introduced himself before the crowd as NUESTs Minhyun were so loud. The other members also introduced themselves, and somehow we were able to match the screaming for them too. There was just something special about all five introducing themselves as NUESTs. They all seemed so happy to just be there, with all LOVEs surrounding them in the arena. Aron tried to apologise for being hurt, but both the members and the audience protested. He still tried all three days. Its not your fault, Aron!! The members also compared us to [pink fireflies](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3_5h9VUYAAKC_c.jpg), which was also Rens nickname for us LOVEs in the storybook he wrote.  
  
Aron left before the next stage. Love Without Love, or Darkness as its sometimes called in English. This was another song also performed at the Double You concerts, and as beautiful as then, with Aron witched out for Minhyun. Im not going to lie, I would have loved to see Aron perform with the others, them as five, but no matter how sad I am over not being able to see that, I could never blame him for getting hurt. Health should always go first and it was so strong of him to realise that he had to sit out here to be able to participate in the promotions. For a quite slow song, Love Without Love has a quite detailed choreo with a lot of movements. I especially love the part when Minhyun sings dara dara dadada~ I dont wanna let you go with its stepping choreo.  
  
Next song was Look, which always is a fun song live. The fanchant is pretty much us singing along to the entire chorus, and its a chorus everyone knows so it always get loud. The concerts was definitely not an exception!  
  
Look turned into R.L.T.L and suddenly the concert venue was a disco club. As the chorus hit, the lights changed to bathe the stage in neon pink and the lightsticks formed bands of rainbow rippling through the crowd. [This fancam](https://youtu.be/Kr6yP7bAbPQ?t=164) accidentally caught a bit of the crowd, but this is the stage I really hope Pledis uploads for us. Or they put on the concert dvd. Please Pledis?  
  
Next after the three songs was the second ment. Ren and Minhyun left the stage for a bit, and JR and Baekho teased Aron a bit and made him to aegyo to the crowd, both in front and in the back as they stood on the extended stage in the middle. When Ren and Minhyun returned, they quickly joined into the teasing and Aron had to do even more aegyo! They also teased us about spoilers, and JR replied with a cute jump, a jump we later saw in the BET BET MV. I see you JR. They then asked LOVEs what songs we wanted to hear. A lot of people instantly started screaming for Sleeptaking, causing NUEST to dance a bit to it and making us sing it for them while they danced. This might have repeated all three days LOVEs really love Sleeptalking. Way more than NUEST do, haha. Day 2 Ren heard someone scream for Girls Generations Genie and danced a bit to it. Then he made all members dance to it [with varying results](https://twitter.com/tickling0809/status/1117014108732153856). Day 3 we also got a bit of Sandy and the Japanese song Cherry. They made all LOVEs since while they danced, or for Cherry it was mostly the ch-ch-ch-cherry part with Minhyun singing the rest.
  
After joking with us for the ment, they got more serious and started the actual next song. Im Bad! They were actually performing Im Bad for us!! And OT5 version of Im Bad!! The original song was recorded when Baekho had vocal cord nodules and he was unable to participate in it, so it was really special to have this song performed as five. There was not a lot of choreo for it, and the members instead walked around the extended stages to sing and wave to us fans. We also got to sing along with the chorus. It was such a sweet song. I also found this [super pretty fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKWSaoJj6Mc) that really shows our pink firefly ocean so well.  
  
Aron, Baekho, and Ren left the stage, leaving Minhyun and JR alone behind. Lights had been dimmed as the three members left, and suddenly two spotlights lit up Minhyun and JR. Thats when we heard from the moon to the stars Daybreak! We were getting Daybreak live! JR and Minhyun sang this from the extended stage along the first floor of the seated sections, so my view day 1 and 2 was just incredible. Day 1 they stopped just by where I was sitting for the ending, which they sang standing next to each other. They got even closer the next two days, with having their arms around each others backs for the second day, and [JR resting his head on Minhyuns shoulder](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4HdlZIUUAMlXzy.jpg) while Minhyun was singing for the third. For me during Day 2, JR walked to just below my section and stopped there to wave to us and mouth along to Minhyuns lines. Both days had them so close to where I was sitting!  
  
As the light dimmed to let Minhyun and JR leave, a VCR started playing. It was all individual shots again to prepare us for solo stages.   
  
Baekhos solo stage was the first. He did his solo from W.HERE,  . It was really beautiful. He started while playing the piano, then got up and sang towards the crowd. He was dressed completely in white and really looked like and angel singing to us. It was really beautiful.  
  
Aron was next. Because the decision to sit out the songs because of health had come quite recent, they had done a fast rearrangement of his first solo Good Love, making it slower and jazzier, to fit sitting down. For a last minute fix it sounded incredibly good! I really liked the new feel of it and Aron got the crowd to sing along and do the fanchants.  
  
Then it was Minhyuns turn with Universe. This was the very first time Universe was performed, so all of us were really looking forward to it. The song started out with him sitting on height adjustable stage screens, that were shaped like stairs for the song. As the chorus was about to start, he got up and walked up the stairs to the top level, where he sang the chorus looking out over the crowd. As the woah woah woah part started, Minhyun walked down the stairs construction again and made it to the stage floor in time for the next verse to start. On the stage, we got more choreo, and it fitted really well to the song and Minhyun.   
  
After Minhyun it was Rens turn. And if there is a common theme for a Choi Minki solo stage, it is that it has to be extra. We knew this would be incredible as the lights darkly lit up a bed swept in drapery on the extended middle stage. Ren performed the first verse and chorus while in the bed, and then got out and teased us with the drapery for a moment before appearing to us. Dancers joined and the choreo kept alternating between energetic and sexy. For the bridge, the dancers wrapped him in scarf-like fabrics, that then let go as the chorus started again and the choreo now included these scarves, with Rens standing out as blue among the dancers white ones.  
  
Last up was JR. Oh, god, JR. He was kind of the reason I held off writing this, so I would be able to focus on and remember other parts of the concert than this one performance. JR was the only one to sing his solo from WAKE,N. Very likely because WITH did not fit the vibe of the stage he had prepared for us. The stage started with heavier instrumentals than usual. It was a rock version of I Hate You. And it sounded so good. JRs rapping really fits a heavier sound. The choreo was as explosive as ever. But that is not the part most people remember from this performance. His shirt was quite loose, and Day 1 gave us really good glimpses of his chest, and also his abs as he also grabbed his shirt and lifted to show us. Day 2 he got more confident and opened it completely. Day 3 he completely took it off. He has worked out a lot for LOVEs and this performance and [it really showed](https://k.kakaocdn.net/dn/bFGGCo/btquA2ntpcR/9tAyHZLV9MQ854FwbXdSX0/img.gif). Day 3 was also the day I had a really good view of the main stage. Ill just say that all of us screamed. A lot.  
  
As JRs stage ended we were all just breathing shockedly. And thats when they decide to show us the emotional VCR. In the VCR, Minhyun walks in to a room where the other four members are sitting by a table. He joins them and they all smile and welcome him. Showing this just after JRs stage was so unfair. I was going through a full rollercoaster of emotions at this point. They all smiled so lovingly towards each other in this VCR and I was almost crying at how sweet it was.  
  
Soft lights focused on the stage and Aron, Baekho, and Ren appeared on the stage. The song they were singing was A Little Bit More, from Hello mini album. It is a really sweet ballad, originally sang by Baekho and Minhyun. The live performance by this trio was really sweet and beautiful. The stage ended with a single last spotlight on Aron as he sang the ending , while Baekho and Ren turned around to walk towards each side of the stage, and sit down at the small stairs behind them.  
  
Lights came on again, and Minhyun and JR had joined the other three on stage. The five of them were now sitting on the stairs, and the song that started playing is an emotional one to all LOVEs: ONEKIS2. ONEKIS2 is a really beautiful ballad, with lyrics about comforting someone you love. Its always one of the songs LOVEs sing back to NUEST at encores because of the symbolism. It also have a more or less improvised fanchant , to join in for JRs Dont worry.   
  
When the song ended, NUEST remained standing on the stage, with a soft piano transition leading to the next song. The part of the stage the members were standing on started rising to form pillars. The transition lead into the start of the actual song, the haunting opening tones of Lost &amp; Found, from Q Is (and also really familiar to SSP players for its difficult beatmap). For Minhyuns opening lines, his pillar started rising above the others as he sang. As his part lead into Rens, the pillars again changed, lowering Minhyun and rising Ren up. This continued through the song, with both Baekho and Minhyun being raised up for their alternating duet chorus. At the end, they were all lowered back to the stage, and the digital backdrop that had been showing snow images, darkened and let a star shower fall down on them.  
  
The lights turned on, brighter this time. We had another ment. This ment was really cute, all members made aegyo based on a little bit (in Korean the song is only called a little bit instead of a little bit more). They also talked a bit about their solo stages. Ren joked about upgrading the chair from the original performance to a bed this time, and all of them kept telling each other that their performances had been cool and sexy. The members were a bit careful with JR the first day, and only talked about how much he had worked out to prepare before the stage. The next two days all hesitation went away and they made him hold up his shirt and show his abs again. He had a really cute outfit for this part, so seeing cute JR show abs special and we all screamed. JR looked a bit shy, but also happy at the attention. The last day the other members made him lift his shirt two times, but only after checking first, as the first thing he did after he got off the stage after his solo was to drink coca-cola. He had not been able to drink soda for months! He had been preparing really hard for this stage and LOVEs, both working out and dieting.   
  

Next Aron left the stage to let the other four do some more choreo based songs. The first song was VVITH, where they started out on the middle stage, and then walked out on the extended stage. This meant I got to see them so close up from my seat the first night! Also the second, as JR walked up to and danced by my section towards the end of the song! VVITH has the cutest choreo, with lots of aegyo and dorky dance moves. The members also made everyone sing along to the you you you you and I part.  
  
VVITH quickly lead into Pretty, which is another cute song with dorky choreo. JR stayed near my section for the first part, then they all got together on the middle stage again. At the middle stage, there is one part where the song slows down when Minhyun sings. He and Baekho walked together for this part, with Minhyuns arm over Baekhos shoulders, and JR jumps and throws confetti over them. Except JR and coordination when it comes to throwing things The first day, he slips and falls over while throwing, causing most of the confetti to fall over himself instead. The second day he only manages to throw half the confetti and throws the rest over him and Ren instead. The third day he finally managed to throw the confetti correctly! The first day JR even [scratched his hand](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4ATf3kUwAIo6nR.jpg) when he fell. Fortunately, nothing serious. They ended the stage by running back to the main stage to do one more dorky chorus dance. One of the days Baekho lost balance at the ending pose and stumbled a bit and started to laugh as the other members noticed.  
  
The venue went dark and another VCR started. Ill be honest and say that I dont remember this VCR at all, more than that there definitely was a VCR here as they had a costume change. After talking a bit with friend we have agreed that it was a black and white artsy VCR with dramatic solo shots, that ended in the logo being shown.  
  
So after the slightly forgettable VCR, something not as forgettable began. We were moving onto early-NUEST stages! Four extremely familiar chairs appeared on stage, and soon NUEST (minus Aron) sat down in them for the starting position of Face. For quite a few of the pre-Produce songs, fanchants are so-so, with only parts of the audience having learned the full fanchant. Face is not one of those songs. Everyone there knew the Face fanchant and it was the loudest of all chants each night. As a bit of a flashback, their clothes were styled a bit like school uniforms, just like they used to have back during Face promotions. I enjoyed hearing Minhyun sing his iconic lines hey whats up loser and click the like it.  With only four of them on stage, the song was nearing its end. And what is at the end if not one of the most iconic raps in kpop by a certain Kwak Aron. Would they have it just as a backtrack? Would JR attempt to rap in English? As JRs rap ended, lights directed towards the back of the stage. Sitting on a chair, rising up from below was no one other than Aron, there for his rap. The others continued the choreo as Aron sat on the chair, looking out over the crowd and doing his rap perfectly. He is unreplaceable for those lines, so Im happy they found a way for him to still be in the song.  
  
NUEST usually follow Face by Action during concerts, and today really was no exception. Action was the next song, and we got some nice synchronized jumping. Action is a really fun song live, especially since half the fanchants are just saying action. Here they decided to leave out Arons raps completely. Some lines or partial lines were still on the backtrack, but mostly it was quiet except for the cut ins, and they used the part to walk to the middle stage.  
  
Pledis actually uploaded the next song, so I dont have much to say about it. Beautiful Ghost is really fun live too, and more synchronized jumping! Yay! Im happy they brought back the jumping for BET BET choreo.  
  
Somehow we had already reached the last ment before the encore. Since it was just after performing some older songs, they talked about how it brought back the memory of debut days. They talked about how young they were then, and how it had already been seven years. They also decided to drop a huge bomb on us. Originally, Face was not their planned debut song! The song they originally planned for debut was called [Blessing](https://twitter.com/minspolaris/status/1117373764402999296) and was completely different from Face. It was really cute and fresh, fitting for a young group. Im still really happy that they went with Face, it is such a legendary debut song. Day 3 they decided to sing a bit for us, with JR doing parts of the choreo. Im really hoping they will release the demo sometime, as a gift to LOVEs!   
The third day JR also accidentally spoiled that LOVE Story is happening. This was before any teasers dropped. All of them are really bad at not giving spoilers.  
  
As a surprise, the last song before the encore was five-members If You! The song that pretty much was written about Minhyun was now sung by him. It was really beautiful and symbolic. However, LOVEs were not prepared for this song and accidentally did the original fanchant with NUEST Double You in it the first day The members looked a bit amused at the crowd that day. But the next day we were ready. The double you part got replaced by saranghae, we love you. And where we chant the members names, we added Minhyun. His [smile](https://twitter.com/desertfoxhmh/status/1117547006350675968) was the sweetest. They reused the hanging platforms from Hello for this stage, and again let the edges of the platform lit up in a square around the person singing. They were all sitting on the platforms instead of standing, and got off the platforms at the end of the song. This was also the song where we did the banner project. Some sections had bigger pieces to hold up, so that the entire section formed a letter, while some held smaller banners with the entire text. The first day I was part of a letter and could not see how it looked, but the next two days I could see it well and it looked really pretty!  
  
For the encore we would normally sing, but the fan project had been moved to later, so instead we just chanted for encore until the VCR started. The VCR was scenes of them practicing for the concert, and also letters they had written for LOVEs. It was really sweet.  
  
After the VCR, dim spotlight focused on the stage as the first tones of A Song For You started to play. They were all wearing the concert t-shirts and black pants. A Song For You is such a beautiful ballad. The members could not help but tearing up and people around me cried loudly as well. Before the concert, LOVEs had gotten to vote for a fanchant to reply with at the end. Minhyuns last line is Fill in the title of this song for me. After a few beats, LOVEs reply with We will complete the title of this song. The first night we sang it a bit off timing, with people singing at different times making it a bit difficult to hear. So JR looked a bit confused at first, and then asked us if we said that we wrote the song? People started to laugh and Baekho corrected him. He then apologised while still laughing a bit. Then the mood got more serious, as they started talking about how big it was for them to be there. How they had watched their sunbaes perform here as trainees and ever since them dreamed about doing the same. And now they stood on the stage in the same venue they had once dreamed about. They also talked how important it was for them to be there as five. JR said he had cried when practicing because how precious this was to him, that they were here all five. Minhyun talked about how proud he had been watching the other four on stage for the past two years, and how happy he now was to stand there with them.  

The second day JR mentioned that his family was there to see the concert that day, and then Baekho added that it also was JRs fathers birthday. So the entire arena started singing [happy birthday](https://twitter.com/janinekwon_/status/1117044236543610880) to JRs dad. It was really sweet and you could tell JR was touched by it. A [fan account](https://twitter.com/pockiyrj/status/1117064815715840000) also popped up from someone who sat near JRs dad and who said that he really appreciated it too. The second day the members also talked about how important both members and LOVEs are to them. JR expressed it as what he is lacking, the members and LOVEs make up. And how grateful he is that members and LOVEs are there when he is going through hard times.   
  
The last day had the most emotional ment. Ren wrote a really emotional [letter](https://twitter.com/608jonghyun/status/1117458368661032960) that he read out loud at the concert, while both he and the others teared up. 


Next they got ready to take a picture with us. As the camera staff counted down to take the picture, LOVEs got ready to sing. After the picture, we all sang. The first day we did ONEKIS2. Day 2 was Thank You. And Day 3 was Fine Girl, but with boy instead of girl. The first two days went well. NUEST looked ",,
eally surprised at us singing and started to thank us after the first chorus. But we started on the second verse and they stopped to continue to listen. When we got stuck on rap parts they tried to interrupt us again, but LOVEs pushed through to sing all of it, and they looked really amused at how we continued to sing even if they attempted to stop us. Day 3 wasspecial. Fine Girl is not as easy to sing without a backtrack as ONEKIS2 or Thank You, and the result was quite messy. Yet we kept singing. All at different parts of the song. There are some really [funny pics](https://twitter.com/amusingjonghyun/status/1117397582005673986) and [videos](https://twitter.com/desertfoxhmh/status/1117858180191514624) of their reactions to us singing Fine Boy. We still pushed through to sing the entire song. Even with NUEST trying to stop us. But I think it was good to have that comedic relief after all the emotions earlier.  ,,,,,,,,,
  ,,,,,,,,,,,,
After making it through LOVEs singing, it was time for the last two final songs. To the joy of the crowd, NUEST had decided to perform Not Over You, a really cute b-side from Action. They sang it while walking around, waving to all LOVEs there. There was also lot of hugging between the members, with some tearing up while singing.  ,,,,,,,
  ,,,,,,,,,,,,
The very last song is the ultimate fan song for our fandom, Hey Love. The Korean version has actually never been released digitally, only as a physical album only release on Re:Birth. Yet this is a song all LOVEs know. NUEST continued to [walk around and wave](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1116708326081847297) to everyone. This way, I got to see them up close for Hey Love all three days, just from different angles! The first day they [stopped so close to where I was sitting](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D39ZFHSVUAA8nxL.jpg) to wave and bow to the crowd. The last day [Minhyun walked past extremely close](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1117411128303214592). This last song and performance was really dedicated to fans, with everyone singing along with [L O V E](https://twitter.com/dessiday/status/1117037777479036928). They ended the performance by spelling out [L O V E with their bodies](https://twitter.com/minspolaris/status/1117035976407183363), except that JR accidentally made a J instead of an L one of the days, hahahah!    ,,,,,
  ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once the concert ends, you are kind of still in a trance. I met up with my friends after the concert, at the [intersection](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/200820245563310080/567020804252893194/image0.jpg) of NUEST and Monsta X photo zones. Monsta X had their concert literally next door which was a bit weird experience sharing the square outside the venue with another fandom. It is really nice to meet up with friends after, just to share all emotions (or just scream over Jonghyun abs) and impressions from the concert. The first two days we just agreed that we were too exhausted to do anything but going home and sleep after, but the last day a few of us ended up going out for dinner together. Over the next week in Seoul, some of us [met up a lot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D45u-YoVUAALu1K.jpg) and I am so happy to be able to call these people friends. There is something special about fandom friends. We can talk about anything together, both things not related to kpop and fangirling hard over NUEST. It is a bit sad we are all spread out all over the world now after the concert, but we have still been screaming over everything related to the comeback over kakao. And who knows," maybe we can all meet up again at another NUEST concert in the future!""",6,86,,

I've always wanted to be a performer but never pursued the path seriously and now I've turned 23 and I feel so... wasted. Like I'm perpetually going to be unfulfilled. Not getting into the audition won't affect my life much (and honestly the chances are like 0.0001%) but I feel like if I don't make it, I will never find meaning and fulfilment in my life. 

I've felt this way my whole life and now I'm truly afraid I will never find meaning in my life always living in the shadow of ""I should've..."" or ""I could've..."" when I was younger and had many years ahead of me to try for being a trainee.",11,11

To recap, they are: Sakura (IZ*ONE), Yuri (IZ*ONE), Chaeyeon (IZ*ONE), Yena (IZ*ONE), Eunbi (IZ*ONE), Soyeon(G-IDLE), Hayoung (Fromis_9), Gyuri (Fromis_9), Seoyeon (Fromis_9), Jiwon (Fromis_9) and Olivia Hye (LOONA)

This season, 101 male idols will be competing for your votes. The same format will be used just like last season. We have even more groups this time as I have not included every member for each group but just about half of the members. These groups have debuted from 2017 to Feb 2019. With comments that IZ*ONE had a lot of votes and significantly more popular, I decided not to include Wanna One in this season. There are still some which might be popular than the rest but hoping this will at least expose  you to some of the groups that you might have not heard of.

Here are the groups included in this season:

1) [14U](https://kprofiles.com/14u-members-profile/)

2) [A.C.E.](https://kprofiles.com/ace-kpop-boy-group-members-profile/)

For this season, I will allow you to vote up to 7 times on the same form instead of submitting it 7 times. Only the first time is required, the rest is not for those who don't want to vote 7 times. You are to choose 11 idols each time, and it can be different for all times. Just don't answer the rest if you don't want to vote all 7 times.

For next week, we will be doing the group ""evaluation"". Based on the response this week, I might tweak the amount of benefit votes since some people think last season has a high amount of benefit votes for the winner. Do help to upvote this thread so that more people will see it. Feel free to campaign and link to your favourite groups as well. Remember, this is done in the spirit of fun so try not to be too spiteful or even voting in multiple accounts. I have enabled the Google sign-in so everyone needs to sign in to their Google account before they can vote.

If you miss any of the weekly post, just search for ""KPOPRODUCE"" so you don't miss out on voting. The voting will end on 9/5/19, 7PM KST.",7,17

### Monthly Format for Town Hall

Since [Summer 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/8v719v/town_hall_changed_to_quarterly_and_census_2018/), Town Hall has been in a quarterly format. However, we felt it was necessary to bring it back to a monthly format to address issues that we are currently dealing with in the subreddit. It will likely stay in a monthly format posted on the first of every month.

---

### PSA about Scammers / Malicious Sites

There has been a return of a certain person sending private messages to users of the subreddit. Were uncertain of what exactly this persons angle or intent is, but this user seems to return repeatedly on various accounts to this community. Please review the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/90u3du/has_anyone_else_gotten_this_weird_private_message/) on this and be wary of any requests that sound similar to this. 

We suggest [reporting the PMs immediately to the admins](https://www.reddit.com/report) as we cannot do much about private message content for constantly changing accounts besides to warn you not to interact with them. 

Similarly, a few sites are getting linked by K-pop fans that was mentioned by /u/bukotnori that can affect users with malicious Javascript which is very serious. Theyre commonly on `www(dot)skpd(dot)live` and can be found on streaming sites or users google drives. If you find that a user has linked it here, please let mods know so it can be removed.

If you see content or users promoting things or linking to sites that seem not quite right, malicious or out of the norm, [PLEASE LET US KNOW](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkpop).

Lastly, we encourage you to practice safe browsing habits. Some sites, while they could provide news, or a user could link you to something of interest, might not always practice the safest delivery methods or be the safest site for your device. We recommend using ad-blocking software such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [uBlock Origin Extra](https://github.com/gorhill/uBO-Extra) for Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox (this method also works on mobile for Android and iPhone users) and whitelist only the sites you trust or wish to give ad revenue to. Additional extensions that would be of use is EFF's [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) and [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).

### Results of Charts and Achievements Poll

During the Emergency Town Hall, we posted a poll on the subject of Charts and Achievements content seen on the subreddit. The results are here! Getting direct feedback from regular users has provided a much clearer view of what you all want to see. 

[The results of the poll as an Imgur album.](https://imgur.com/a/KoUMasR)

Now that we have the basis for what content can be posted, we may need to refine some cases in more detail. The two main topics that had tight results are the Youtube MV view milestones and Pre-order records. For us, this validated why these kinds of posts generate the most amount of conflicts and reporting from users. 

For now, we will go with the literal poll results.

YouTube MV view milestones will be re-instated as per the old rules of the subreddit. Pre-order milestones will be allowed on the subreddit but will follow the same guidelines as physical sales milestones.

As for the results of the virality question, we wanted to know if there would be a strong positive or negative reaction to these cases. A little more than 70% of respondents had a favorable response to both unexpected Youtube view-count cases like Hani's UP&amp;DOWN fancam and unexpected charting like SHAUN's Way Back Home. It shows us that users are mostly cool with these special cases showing up as subreddit posts, even if they dont fit into our standard records rules in any obvious way.

K-Pop related posts rising to the top 100 on /r/all are on slightly shakier ground. Only 54% of respondents had a positive response. We wont be banning posts that reference K-Pop posts rising on /r/all, but we will keep an eye on them to see if they bring extra problems to the subreddit or happen so frequently that we need to reassess our stance.

If you are going to submit a post that is K-pop related that is rising on the top 100 on /r/all, please use non-participation Reddit links.

Replace `www` from a reddit.com link to `np`. An example:

    https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bji3e3/
    https://np.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bji3e3/

**Here are the new revised rules based on the voting on this poll.**

**Content restricted to the weekly automated [Charts and Achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/search?q=title%3A%22charts+and+achievements%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) post which are posted on Fridays:**

* Instiz Real-time and Certified All Kills
* Brand Reputation Rankings
* Streaming Records (Spotify, Oricon, Soundcloud, etc.)
* Subscriber/Follower Counts on Twitter/Instagram/YouTube
* All broken records for views, sales, streaming, charting, etc
* Chart performance on daily, weekly, monthly charts
* Any performance or sales metrics not explicitly permitted on /r/kpop

**Content that will be allowed on the subreddit:**

* Instiz Perfect All Kills
* Physical Sales Milestones of 25k, 50k, 100k, 250k, 500k, 1M &amp; 2M (*FIRST TIME FOR AN ARTIST ONLY*)
* Pre-order Milestones of 25k, 50k, 100k, 250k, 500k, 1M &amp; 2M (*FIRST TIME FOR AN ARTIST ONLY*)
* RIAA, RIAJ, ARIA, BPI certifications
* New peaks or #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200, UK Singles Chart, UK Album Chart, ARIA Singles Chart, ARIA Albums Chart, Oricon half-year, Oricon full-year
* GaOn Triple Crowns and Certifications (*FIRST TIME FOR AN ARTIST ONLY*)
* Youtube MV view milestones
 * Group/artist hits each view milestone of 100M, 200M, 300M, etc (*FIRST TIME ONLY AT EACH MILESTONE*)
 * Most views in 24 hours
 * Fastest to 100 million views
* The first win on a music show for each song.
* Other awards given to artists, songs, or companies such as ""Rookie of the Year"", ""Song of the Year"", Award Nominations, etc.

When submitting content pertaining to ""Charts and Achievements"" make sure to wait for an official announcement or a news article. We will not be allowing screenshots or Twitter sources as a link submission for this content. For records that are time based, please wait after the period till official metrics are posted.

With these changes to Charts and Achievements content, we will be not allowing any exceptions. We will revisit this topic again in the future, if we encounter any more problems. 

---

### Korean Company Disclosure

Official Korean company reddit accounts, accounts managing K-Pop artists promotions, or Western companies promoting something related to K-Pop on the sub need to disclose themselves to readers while doing anything in an official capacity. 

A good example would be the account who has been advertising auditions for [BigHit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b9giml/audition_2019_big_hit_seasonal_audition_la/), /u/KoreanManager who openly disclosed their job on their first post in the sub. 

This should prevent our users from being misled. We will be helping these users flair themselves properly going forward.

We would like these accounts to follow the same submission guidelines that our other users do unless they have special permission. This includes not spamming content from a particular site or group and understanding that some content belongs on a groups subreddit.

---

### Meta Discussions &amp; Personal Rants Disguised as Discussion Posts

We have been allowing far more discussion posts, so we wanted to remind users to only post discussions that follow the rules of the subreddit as a whole. 

Lately there has been a small uptick in discussion posts that do not follow our rules, which require users to ask a question of the community, and then answer it themselves to give users an idea on what they meant. 

Discussion posts should be interactive, not just to affirm a user's belief or get a simple yes/no or right/wrong response. Discussions that simply state an idea, long or short, without asking anything, belong elsewhere. Some of these detailed opinion posts could go to /r/kpoppers, some belong in Town Hall, and some belong on a personal platform.

Personal reviews of albums go into the the new albums discussion post instead of creating individual threads to share opinions.

---

### CF Poll

In our previous Town Hall, we introduced CF as a new link flair. However, we do not have established rules for CF submissions for the subreddit.

Therefore, we have setup a poll to generate what type of CF content you want to see on the subreddit.

Fill out the poll here: [poll.redditkpop.com](http://poll.redditkpop.com/)

Poll instructions: The poll will ask you to authenticate with your Reddit account. We are checking that you have accounts that are greater than a year old. We are not logging what your actual Reddit account is. The poll is anonymous, filled with questions and optional answers in multiple choice format.

---

This is the end of the Town Hall for May.

* Do you have any new ideas, gripes, complaints, suggestions, or random thoughts you may have about r/kpop?  
* How do you like things lately?  
* Do you like the direction the sub is moving in?  
* Any changes you want to see?  

The mods are listening.  You have the floor.",142,104

I also made a [handful of tables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D5cUBBi7TA1WRl1sxjRG4t-uxFcAFIY5/view) separating each group out for those of you whod like to see individual member stats. I organized it by rounds survived then total accumulated points, but I want to mention that this is not a hard list of the most popular members in a group. Longevity was determined by who got matched with who early on (some had it harder than others), and Bracket A got a lot more voters than Bracket B (especially early on). For more context on the data, I suggest checking out [this](https://animebracket.com/stats/r-kpop-ultimate-bias-male-edition-/).

435,2019-05-03,2019,5,3,23,bk980e,Why debut a group with more than 10 members?,GonzoPunchi,1556894392,"Can someone explain to me why korean entertainment companies debut groups with that many members?

Its worse for the group because profit gets divided much more. While each indivdual Blackpink member gets a fourth of the group share, WJSN gets a thirteenth of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Its worse for the company because it costs much more. Some groups have revealed that they pay insane amounts of money on food on a monthly basis. You also need more managers, stylists and other staff. Transport as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The group is less likely to be successfull with that many members. Thats more of a subjective point I guess but I personally really like Loona\`s music for example but I don\`t wanna get into them cause they are 12 members - thats just too much. I don\`t wanna remember 12 names, its also more likely that you dont like some members in a big group. If you have a bias in a 12-member group, you\`re gonna get so much less content (song lines, variety shows, stage performances) than with a smaller group.

&amp;#x200B;

The only argument that would suggest a big group has its advantages would be that the group could have more ""charms"" overall or more individual talent. But thats kinda not true, if you take some small groups like Blackpink as an example: They have 2 rappers, 2 vocals (altough Jennie and Lisa are also quite good), 4 visuals and one amazing dancer   (Im not some crazy stan, just statin facts). What exactly do you need other than that? Why add more members?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like as soon as its 2 digits, its too much. Debut SNSD and twice are the maximum. More than that just scares people away from getting into the group. If every group with 10+ members would be stripped to the 5 best ones, I claim that that would make them more successfull (obviously before debut).

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about all of this? If you know something I dont know, please go ahead and educate me.",32,0

1.Sns-  Even though bighit and bts probably use SNS more efficiently than any other boygroup this can't be the whole reason for this massive breakout because I feel like you follow a group on sns after you love their music first.

2.Lyrics/Self Made Idols- Another reason is the lyrics that bts write themsevles have have deep messages and themes. Other Idols do this as well thought, especially some even earlier than bts.

3. Vocalists and Rapline- Bts has an amazing rapline and a great vocaline but there are also other 2nd and third gen boygorups who have just as strong as a rap line imo.

I'm trying to figure this out, was BTS just lightning in a bottle or do you think there is some exact reason why other boygroups haven't broken out in the west.",21,0

I only watch variety shows where they made their appearances in, and stream only their songs.

However, theyve just announced to be going on an indefinite hiatus after the next comeback.

I honesty do not know how to feel about this. It just feels like Ill stop following KPop after this, since I could not resonate with the newer groups at all.

I suppose you guys who linger around this subreddit are still pretty much into KPop. Has anyone of you experienced a loss of your bias group, but decided to keep yourselves abreast of KPop development?

Basically you register for either category and they will (supposedly) write back with audition details under that particular category (i.e. Global auditions have dates in JAPAN, and obviously the China auditions are in CHINESE CITIES). 

Has anyone tried registering for multiple categories at once before, meaning you are alright to audition in ANY of the cities listed in all the categories? i.e. If I register for global auditions AND the china auditions, will they assume you are alright to audition under all the possible places &amp; timings in those 2 categories, and assign you a single slot from a larger pool of available slots?

558,2019-05-05,2019,5,5,8,bkrfer,VAV in SF Concert 5/3 Fan Account,irisfang,1557014049,"  

So let me preface this all by saying that VAV was amazing, please look into them and support them cuz they deserve it. I am really, really glad I went to this concert because they put on a great show. But before I begin my account of that, I need to give a shout out to Studio PAVs horrible management. Skip to after the line/the part in bold if you just care about VAV.

To make a long story short, I got a ticket from a friend as a gift, essentially. And there was no place for a name on the confirmation ticketjust their billing info, an order number, and a barcode in the email they sent. Tickets were apparently will call. So I tried to get in contact with Studio PAV for days before the concert asking if they were going to check ID and whether this would be a problem. Nope. Nothing. The email they provided to contact them bounced back because it had a typo. I think I tried calling 15 times in 3 days, they never picked up. I tried messaging them on FB. Nope. No response. I call the venue, they basically shrug and say Studio PAV has told them nothing, theyre just providing the space for a private event. Finally, day of the concert, a different friend gets in touch and they say they will be checking ID and it has to match the billing info, no exceptions. Im crushed, thinking I cant go. But then another person hears that PAV has never checked ID before for a GA ticket. Which is it? My friends (who deserve an award for how much they supported me through this) basically mounted a war campaign trying to get into contact with Studio PAV to clarify things. Shout-out to them because the power of friendship is real. Anyway, they tried Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, calling on the phone, you name it, they tried it. Did PAV ever respond? Nope. Just sent back an automated message about not responding quickly when its not work hours*when it was literally hours before a concert they were organizing.*

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my friends convinced me to go to the venue and try to figure things out there. I arrive (took like an hour on public transport). I find a staff person and ask what the ticketing process is like. Sorry, I just work for the venue, I have no idea, please go stand in line. Great, ok, I go to stand in line. I stand in line for a while. Eventually staff comes by to check and see whos over 21 because the venue serves alcohol. I show them my ID. They give me a wristband that says merry Christmas on it. It is May. I have to laugh at this. I keep standing in line. Towards the front, I can see Studio PAV staff checking peoples names off a clipboard. I find out that this is for VVIP. I wait some more. The PAV staff come by, and the girl behind me asks how GA are supposed to get their tickets. Sorry, we havent been given instructions for that yet, we dont know, says the Studio PAV staff, less than an hour before the concert is supposed to start. I see them huddling around their phones, typing furiously. Maybe Studio PAV HQ is leaving them on read as well. Finally, they come back, do VIP peopleagain with names off clipboards. I wait some more. The staff disappear into the venue. Finally, they reappear and start doing GA. They ask you show your order number on your phone and then tell them the associated last name. Thats it. Then they stamp your hand with a stamp that says great day. [This is what my hand looked like in the end.](https://i.imgur.com/jSFviDO.jpg) The e-mail has a barcode, but they dont have a barcode scanner, because that would imply a bare minimum level of organization that clearly far surpasses anything Studio PAV is capable of. To be clear, I want to say that the PAV volunteers seemed perfectly nice and pleasant; I have nothing against the volunteers. They were being left in the dark too obviously. But the actual management company is a disgrace that cannot communicate properly with anyone, be it customers or their own staff. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rant about PAV over, the part about VAV starts here**. The show actually started on time, which giveneverything about the management, was a shock. Despite having a GA ticket I was actually quite close to the stage. [This was my view.](https://imgur.com/PUjzHUm) VAV came out (just six of them, Jacob is in China for individual activities) and immediately started performing an intro + remix of Thrilla Killa. People immediately started doing fan-chants and singing along, it was a great atmosphere even though I think the concert only had about 350 people in attendance. They all sounded great live, special shout-out to St. Van because my jaw dropped a little at how good his voice did.

The concert was technically a meet and live so they would perform songs and then have a little intermission and do something for the fans. They had a segment where they answered fan questions, for example. They all spoke English and didnt use a translator! Lou translated whenever they spoke in Korean, but that wasnt too often, they made a real effort to speak in English. They also had a segment where they each picked a fan to bring on stage for, and then each fan picked a card that had something on it and they did whatever that thing was. They actually brought a dude on to stage (he got the selfie with VAV card) which I thought was nice! Some other options were they take a video on your phone for you (I think they recorded a happy birthday message?), one member sings for you, that kind of thing. During some of the other breaks we got Ayno freestyling while Ziu beatboxed, the members talking about what they loved about the area, and that kind of thing. During performances Lou kept having to ask people to step back for safety because apparently the crowd at the front was really pushing? I saw him asking some people if they were ok, as well. I was several rows back and had plenty of space, luckilyI didnt get pushed or shoved at all. Im glad VAV being attentive and called fans out for crowding, though.

They basically performed all of their songs from 2017 and onwards minus like one bside from Thrilla Killa. VAV is basically pretending they debuted in 2017 at this point and I cant blame them. They also did some covers, including Despacito! They talked about what a challenge it was to prepare for a song that was in Spanish and English but they said it was worth it in the end, and I have to say it was a really great performance!

Its hard to pick a favourite performance because they were all so good. Lou said his favourite song to perform is Give It To Me, which is already a song of theirs I love and that made me appreciate it more. But honestly I thought the entire concert just had a really great consistency in quality to it; even towards the end when the boys were covered in sweat (and St. Van had long since said goodbye to his jacket), they performed super well. Side not, its interesting because St. Van is the leader and the boys obviously treat him as such; theyd come up to him and whisper in his ear/ask him questions. But he doesnt stand in the center (always off to the side), is pretty quiet, and generally just kinda laughs a lot and watches over the rest of the boys. He seems quite reserved but also really sweet. 

That being said, he, like the rest of the members, would take peoples phones from the front to record videos with them and suchthey did that a lot, especially as the concert drew to a close. They talked about how they wanted to come back to a bigger and better venue as seven, and made the crowd pinky promise that we would come back. Lou announced they had one more song, which of course was an emotional/slow song. They left the stage, people chanted VAV, and then they came out to perform Senorita and Thrilla Killa again. They thanked us all and then left the stage again (although St. Van stayed after and kept waving). Overall, they put on a fantastic performance and I would absolutely go to a VAV concert again. I just hope next time it has a different organizer. 

&amp;#x200B;

VAV themselves get a 10/10, though. Please check them out if you haven't before!",6,48

It got me thinking - with the rapid pace of the Kpop industry and lots of small companies that launch groups without the resources to promote them, what other gems have debuted and then disappeared?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not talking about groups that have had multiple comebacks/EPs/Full-Albums and strong careers that ended too soon, this is about nugu groups that seemed to have what it takes to succeed but for some reason never did.  

&amp;#x200B;

My choice, and the one that made me think about this, is Bella.  They launched with [Don't Let Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM98JLBmEsU), which is a cover of the En Vogue song, but better than the original IMO.  Their vocals are just flat-out amazing, I can't believe people slept on these girls, they absolutely slay in that song.  They then followed up with [Get Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9gOT2XQAcg), which is a perfectly respectable 2nd Gen Dance Pop track with some easily above-par vocals.  Then they disappeared.  It looks like one of the members, who went by Miuu in Bella changed her stage name to Bo Hye and then joined Kiss &amp; Cry (which also just fell apart after a couple of songs) and has since joined [Destiny](https://kprofiles.com/destiny-members-profile-facts/).  I can't find out what happened to the other two girls, if they left the industry or joined other groups, but with a popular member of Elris calling herself Bella it's hard to shift through the noise.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, what are some other groups that coulda woulda shoulda been great but somehow just never made it past the first step?  Bonus points for video links!",179,175

Sort of like how I thought Dara is really adorable and then read somewhere she saves stray cats or cares about the Philipines. Meanwhile I've never liked Seungri...I'll lie now if I say ""I knew it, he is a perv!"" but he had this cold/repulsive ""aura"" around him idk. And now with the scandal I can say he is the only idol I don't like I really don't mind anyone else.

A week ago, I just happened to click on a Super Junior video and I have been absolutely obsessed ever since. I don't know why they just caught my eye after 10 years of listening to Kpop and I really didn't think I would be obsessing over a kpop group as a college student but theres something special and different about suju that makes them soOOOO attractive (yesung is my ultimate bias omfg that man could legit step on me). 

Anyways, it makes me kind of sad that they're an older group and I was wondering if there was still anybody who actively follows and supports the group? Their newer MVs are not getting as many views as they should be which makes me super sad but it would be really comforting to know that there are still people who actively stan them??",14,11

The ones I do find, are from here, or from youtube. But the problem is that they tend to be from mid to high tier agencies.

a) Sending in an email

b) Applying via their online form.

I haven't received a confirmation email for either stating something like ""Thank you for sending in your application bla bla we will let you know of your audition date/time soon!"" - does anyone know a) if we're supposed to receive this after APPLYING b) if we don't ever receive it, does it mean it's an immediate rejection?

I'm not asking about the email with the exact audition venue/time/date yet, just wondering if there will be a confirmation email sent after applying and if yes, how long did you guys wait before getting this?

* N from vixx  learning to accept his skin tone and stopping his efforts to change himself, we dont know if it still hurts him but im sure there comes a time in an idols life where they know how to deal with the same insult theyve heard for years. We dont know if or how it still affects him, but he seems to not be ashamed about it anymore. 



* This also reminds me of Taemins beautiful growth and maturity in the public eye from such a young age, every called him girly but as he gor older he flipped that to ""theres a spectrum of how men can be, yknow."" Not sure what his turning pount was but we know Jonghyun had a big part in helping him be less self conscious. 



* I believe it was JB that said when he first started his career as GOT7 leader he wanted to win all the time and win shows and awards as much as possible but then he realized the competition is really high. Then he started to focus more on being the best artist he can be to the people that listen to his music",62,95

This contest will determine what people think is the best K-pop music video. There will be a separate contest for boy groups. You can vote for co-ed groups in this contest if you want. When choosing your top 5, please **DO NOT** take into account song quality. A song that's not as good may have an amazing music video and vice versa. Try to think about things like aesthetic appeal, color scheme, set/budget, storyline, choreography, etc.

The first round will be the qualification round to determine which music videos should be nominated. Please nominate your top 5 girl group music videos using the following format:

Song Title - Group name

For example, here are my nominations  
1. 4 Walls - f(x)  
2. The Light - The Ark  
3. Goodnight - Dreamcatcher  
4. Lion Heart - SNSD  
5. Peek-a-boo - Red Velvet

You can only vote **ONCE** in this round. There is also a question on the form asking how many music videos per group should be nominated once the qualification round is over.

But I think things are changing really fast. I don't think it's accurate to put these three groups on the same category anymore.

Both Twice and BP became so big they're now playing in their own league, but RV didn't catch up. I am not saying RV is not popular anymore, but that Twice and BP skyrocketed and RV did not.

Don't get me wrong, please. I am no hater. I actually enjoy RV songs. But there's no deny a huge gap appeared between the three. RV is in an odd position right now, because even the rookies are catching them. Iz One already sell more than RV in Korea, and Itzy's debut was something I never saw in my life.

Honestly, if their next comeback goes RBB way, RV will definitely lose some ground. Rookies are already making noise and Twice and BP are too far away from everyone else

Is this the end of 3rd generation holly trinity? Did RV lose its status of big three? What groups are gonna form the 4th generation holly trinity? (I think Itzy and Iz One are really good candidates, but I will wait for more debuts).

Anyway, just wanted some discussion. Again, I don't intend to disrespect anyone. This is just my opinion. Feel free to attack my ideas, but no me. Peace. ",5,0

##Seungri was questioned regarding embezzlement for 16 hours.

##JTBC spotlight reported that Hwang Hana was a VIP at Burning Sun who also enjoyed so-called ""House Parties""

[/u/imtooyoung2die translates that Hwang Hana was known to have enjoyed a particular relationship with Burning Sun CEO Lee, and there were even times when she wore the Mansour set golden belt. A burning sun internal informant made it known that ""she came to the club wearing mainly a hat and mask. She's also associated with Madam Lin and play at the VIP table often. Hwang Hana and the club's MD Jo used Philopon even inside Burning Sun, and Jo told other people with his own mouth that he used (drugs) with Hwang Hana."" Another informant asserted that ""in the case of Hwang Hana, she's very close to many well-off friends or people at drinking places. Because they have many good houses or sponsors give them houses or they have money to spare, they rent places like hotels to play, take drugs and do house parties where they have sex with each other."" More than anything, the informants said ""if Hwang Hana just only took drugs, it wouldn't be like this. Because of Hwang Hana, not just one or two kids have their lives ruined. She didn't even apologize about that.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bj0gxb/burning_molka_21_police_to_apply_for_arrest/emdzcp9/)

##Hwang Hana's father's company employees are also under investigation as 2 of the phones she handed into police are under one of these employee's names.

[/u/btsstory translates that it was the only phone she used for drug-related and drug dealing messages. The prosecution is trying to find out how she did that and if she got help from someone. The messages of that phone were all questions and replies about giving ecstasy and injecting meth to acquaintances. Hwang Hana insisted those messages were fabricated but the authorities are investigating to see if there are more accomplices. 2 have already been booked.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bj0gxb/burning_molka_21_police_to_apply_for_arrest/emfw7uz/)

##Choi, the first assailant of Kim Sang Kyo, has a close relationship with Lee Moonho

[/u/btsstory translates that they have a hyung-dongsaeng relationship, and he's co-CEO of a cafe that is of the same brand as Lee Moonho's. His cafe is in Seoul, but the flagship cafe is in Apgujeong, Gangnam and Lee Moonho was the co-CEO until the case started when he stepped down from the cafe's management and handed down it's shares. It is a famous cafe which had its co-CEO as a baseball player who is Seungri's Friend. Choi was presented earlier as a non-celebrity guest not related to BS staff but this has been confirmed alongside his close relationship with BS MD KIM as well, one of the group chat members.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it because of their marketing? International fans finding them more appealing somehow? Or is the kpop scene different in Korea itself? ... ?

873,2019-05-07,2019,5,7,22,blqvgf,A rant towards the International K-pop community from a Korean.,LeftDrink,1557236660,"So I just decided to write this message to get these feelings off my chest. This is for International K-pop fans but may be relevant for anyone who is interested in Korea.

I am a mixed race Korean who has experienced both aspects of Korean and European life and my feelings differ from that of a normal Korean person because of my unique upbringing, so are in no way representative of the average Korean person.

Basically, I personally am so tired of how ridiculously overblown everything is in Korean Entertainment. I particularly dislike how opinionated and ""crazy"" people become over idols who are in the most part hardworking normal humans with all the flaws and merits as anyone else. I really dislike how quick the international community comes to condemn idols (mostly female idols - which I can't seem to get my head around). I have friends who work in this industry so I feel obliged to write this.

So here are a few things I'm going to point out to the international community:

1. If you like K-Pop groups in general - You probably like them because of how **visually appealing** they are. **It's fine**. Don't deny it, that's part of the industry and game of Korean entertainment which makes it unique - the stunning visual display. Don't try and tell me you listen just for the music because if that were the case you should be able to name numerous musically talented Korean bands or singers popular on the MeLon music charts in Korea. 
2. **Korean Music is very diverse**. Korean Pop and Idol culture is a fraction of the culture as a whole here in Korea. 
3. **Misinterpretations** of translations are **extremely common**. If you don't know Korean well, please restrain from judging people based off of a translation. Languages are very different. I see this way too often.
4. This should apply to everything but please don't assume things to be true because you read something on the internet. Just be aware as with the point above, there is a huge amount of misinterpretations from translational misunderstanding. If you really want to experience - travel if you can.
5. **Female Idols** receive a huge amount of criticism from the media for doing virtually nothing. This doesn't make sense to me because most people in the K-pop Community are female themselves.  The only way I can see this making sense is **jealousy.** Please don't be like that, you make an already cruel reality a little more miserable.
6. As with point 3, 4 - if you use websites such as AllKpop or Soompi and see titles like ""netizens say..."" be careful when interpreting these articles. **Very rarely do they represent common opinion here in Korea**, and more often than not they have ""cherry-picked"" particular comments and opinions from various websites.
7. Lastly, you don't know Korean culture well if you know K-Pop. Please don't lecture me about social issues in Korea, if you haven't lived here and/or don't know the language very well. That automatically signals that your opinion means very little... **I'm very sorry but that is the truth.** The culture here is different and is rooted in Confucian, hierarchical and even Christian values. There are complex issues that require sophisticated insight and not a s\*\*\*\*\* translation, and your opinion rooted in your own culture's way of thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here ends my rant. As with most things, this is an opinion that is not representative of Koreans and is just what I've observed. In the end, I'm very happy we can all interact and share our culture and opinions but the way quite a few international K-pop fans acts makes me sad. I hope people can read this and understand where I am coming from.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know your opinions ;) I love a discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

Many Thanks :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm putting out a request for writers on my new blog,  [KPOP Observed](https://kpopobserved.com/). This blog is dedicated to covering the latest news about Kpop and the Korean entertainment industry as a whole, as well as posting just fun content for fans. If you go to the site, you can see a handful of articles I posted. However, it is quite stressful for one person to attempt to cover all sorts of news in the industry. I am looking for dedicated writers who could post creative and newsworthy articles to my site. For now, the position will be voluntary, but once the site breaks even, pay can be expected soon after. 

Email me at [edisonlee@kpopobserved.com](mailto:edisonlee@kpopobserved.com) if you're interested in becoming a writer for my site. Thank you!

Hello everyone,

I'm putting out a request for writers on my new blog, [KPOP Observed](https://kpopobserved.com/). This blog is dedicated to covering the latest news about Kpop and the Korean entertainment industry as a whole, as well as posting just fun content for fans. If you go to the site, you can see a handful of articles I posted. However, it is quite stressful for one person to attempt to cover all sorts of news in the industry. I am looking for dedicated writers who could post creative and entertaining articles to my site of any variety. For now, the position will be voluntary, but once the site breaks even, pay can be expected soon after.

Email me at [edisonlee@kpopobserved.com](mailto:edisonlee@kpopobserved.com) if you're interested in becoming a writer for my site. Thank you!

----

I have rearranged the digital charts and have gotten rid of Naver since that is no longer on the iChart (finally!). It was replaced by Flo, but I do not have access to Flo's data so until it is made available online or to Android users, I won't be including that data on these posts. If you have a source that reliably gives Flo data let me know!

Now as you know, BTS is THE BIGGEST BOYBAND IN THE WORLD  NO UNIVERSE  NO MULTIVERSE *Queue marvel timeline scene in Endgame*, but that doesnt mean our star studded, perfect skinned, 7 member music gods will not get wrapped up into something. Now yes, this is just for fun, some rambling from a random fanboy of BTS  and K-Pop and also theyre tv shows  but that doesnt mean I cant cast out a little spicy net just for fun. 

PREDICTION #1 

East Meets West: The Queen of Pop w/ The Golden Boy from Busan 

Now Ill be honest with you, this is FARFETCHED  Nah, more like a Fanfiction  but Ill be honest, these two looked cute with each other, then again when two beautiful representatives collide with each other, its really more of a force of nature rather than cute couple. If you dont know what Im talking about, its Jeon Jung-Kook and Ariana Grandes #Flawless photo-op that was bestowed by the Instagram gods on my feed. Why do I think this? In simple terms, they would be a FIRE couple, like JayZ and Beyonc FIRE. In my terms, its just a gut feeling, itd be comparable to the royal couple of Meghan Merkle and that British prince (Harry?) 

PREDICTION #2 

Daegu boy snaps with a full fledged solo album 

I just need a big hit labeled solo album by Suga pls 

PREDICTION #3 

Mochi also goes Solo

No indication this will be true, but Jimin going solo as well. If I could get an album with the same vibes as Serendipity and Promise Ill be forever indebted to you Jimin-nim. 

PREDICTION #4 

3Jack Unit 

3 referencing our 3 vocalists V, Jimin, and Jung-kook, while Jack references the Jack of all Trades  Jeon Jung-kook himself  as he can rap as well (I think hes good at least",2,0

I'm not sure whether it is having to sign-in to Google or because the form now allow you to vote up to 7 times or just people are missing it, I'm only having 198 votes for this first round. Hopefully, the votes will pick up these next rounds. Reminder that the first elimination will take place on Week 4.

Here are now the results from 101 to 1.

It will be on this [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/kpoproduce-2).

It's voting time again. Just like last week, each redditor has up to SEVEN votes each. You can choose to vote lesser than 7 times if you wish. 

For this week, it's also group evaluation time. Using Random.org, all of the 101 idols has been split up into 16 groups. For groups that have different number of members, the average vote will be counted. Each idol will also add on the number of votes during the group evaluation voting they receive to their overall total during the elimination round at Week 4. The number of votes of each idol will be revealed next round as well together with the 2nd week ranking. You can only vote ONCE for the group evaluation. The winning group will add on 50 votes to their overall votes.

I messaged the mods asking if I could post this but didn't get a reply So I VERY MUCH hope mods will let this stay.**

As of November 15, 2018 [EXO is the highest selling artist.](https://www.soompi.com/article/1263601wpp/top-10-artists-highest-total-album-sales-since-2010)

Top 3 are:

1. EXO : 10,617,948 (as of Nov 2018)
2. BTS : 9,815,626 (as of Nov 2018)
3. TWICE : 3.7 Million+ (AS OF MAY 2019) [VERIFIED] (YAAAYYYYY!!).

(*Wanna One was a really close no. 4 with 3.57 Million album sales. TWICE recently surpassed them with FANCY YOU.*)

Now, taking BTS and EXO's ONLY major releases numbers (that is the albums that have sales that can actually affect the rankings) SINCE Nov 2018:

**(NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SALES ARE THE SALES THESE BTS and EXO ALBUMS HAVE HAD SINCE NOVEMBER, 2018 TO NOW)**

BTS:

1. Map of the Soul: Persona : 3,229,032
2. Love Yourself : Answer : 165,857
3. Love Yourself : Her : 129,742
4. Love Yourself : Tear : 114,324

Total 'major' sales since November 2018 = 3,638,955

EXO:

1. Love Shot : 505,615
2. Don't Mess Up My Tempo : 256,696
3. The Power of Music : 5,014

Total 'major' sales since November 2018 = 767,325

Thus,

**Total Estimated EXO sales as of May 2019 = 11,385,273**

**Total Estimated BTS sales as of May 2019 = 13,454,581**

I don't think I need to make this more clear but yeah, it is VERY, VERY safe to say that:

**BTS is the now the highest selling artist in Gaon Chart history.**

(*Note that this estimate does NOT include BTS's other albums' combined sales after Nov, 2018 which will actually be easily close to 175K since they sell a LOT long term. On the other hand, researching the chart led me to find that EXO does NOT sell well over time, at least compared to BTS that is. And their combined sales for other albums sales hardly reach around 35K since then.

It's my first time buying a kpop album and i'm looking to get it from Amazon. Amazon.com (US) prices are significantly cheaper than Amazon.ca... I was wondering if any Canadians have experience purchasing from AmazonUS, and were you hit with any extra fees (ex. Customs, import fees, etc.)?

Thanks!",1,1

**Age**

* **CB:** has the youngest member out of all the groups with May, an 04-liner (they have the third &amp; fourth youngest as well). They also have the largest age gap between the oldest &amp; youngest members (8 years), with birth years ranging from 1996-2004. Fun fact: they have at least one member born in every year from 96-04 as well.  
Breakdown by year: 96(1) 97(1) 98(1) 99(1) 00(2) 01(1) 02(1) 03(1) 04(1)  
&amp;nbsp;

* **Itzy:** 3 year age gap between oldest &amp; youngest members, ranging from 00-03. They are also the only group out of the four with no members born before 2000.  
Breakdown: 00(2) 01(2) 03(1)

&amp;nbsp;

* **EG:** they have the smallest age gap, just 2 years. And with 4/6 members being 00-line, I'd expect them to be a pretty tight-knit group.  
Breakdown: 98(1) 99(1) 00(4)

&amp;nbsp;

* **Bvndit:** has the oldest overall, 95-liner Yiyeon, age gap between oldest &amp; youngest is 5 years.  
Breakdown: 95(1) 98(1) 99(2) 00(1)

&amp;nbsp;

* Avg age at debut: CB 18.1 Itzy 17 EG 18.7 Bvndit 20  
Bvndit is an outlier here with a rather high average debut age. It would be nice to see them hit it big because maybe then we'll see more companies take a shot with older trainees with a more mature sound/style out the gate.  

&amp;nbsp;

I feel it's worth looking at ages as there are always discussions around it and about what's typical in the industry. Here we see every year from 95-04 represented, so basically ages 24 to 14 can be considered 'debut eligible'. I think most would look at the older end as rarer. Out of the 26 girls, 9 of them are 00-line, by far the most represented. Outside of that, what's interesting is that the groups still feature more pre-2000 girls (10) than post-2000 (7). So the 2000s have not taken over just yet. That being said, Itzy's probably most representative of the future here, as older trainees will find fewer and fewer opportunities to debut.  
Overall Breakdown: 95(1) 96(1) 97(1) 98(3) 99(4) 00(9) 01(3) 02(1) 03(2) 04(1)

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Nationality**  

* **CB** has the most foreign members with 3 from Japan (Kokoro, Remi, May) and 1 from Taiwan (Linlin) (which is *very* similiar to one group in particular...). FNC seems to like Japanese promotions, and with 3 Japanese members I'd look for CB to start promoting there sooner rather than later.
&amp;nbsp;

* **Itzy** is all Korean, which is worth noting given they're the follow up to Twice. No foreign members implies a different marketing strategy will be applied to them, which makes sense to avoid being too closely compared to Twice. It also makes me wonder if they'll leave foreign markets alone for now.
&amp;nbsp;

* **EG** has 1 foreign member, from China(Yiren). A bit surprising there aren't more Chinese members considering it's Yuehua, perhaps this is their way of showing they are committed to promoting in Korea?
&amp;nbsp;

* **Bvndit** is also all Korean, not much of a suprise given the company. Probably the least likely out of the four to do international promotions, outside of a KCON here or there.

&amp;nbsp;

So overall about 19% of the girls are from outside Korea. I don't have any hard numbers but I'm willing to bet that percentage is in line with kpop groups overall. I have a theory that bigger groups are more likely to have foreign members, as Korean companies want to reach other markets without taking spots away from Korean talent, resulting in ""extra"" spots reserved for foreign members. Not a hard rule by any means, but it could be a tendency companies have when forming their groups. 

&amp;nbsp;
  
**Dance**    
Itzy, Everglow, and Bvndit have been better than average dance-wise, something that I feel has been highlighted in the marketing of each group. With Itzy, Ryujin and Yeji both appeared on shows where they got to showcase their dancing skill. I didn't watch Sixteen, but given that her sister is considered a top dancer I imagine Chaeryeong is at a similar level, and they at least showed they had potential back then. Everglow had their title track choreographed by Lia Kim which was hyped up a little, with Lia doing a [behind-the-scenes](https://youtube.com/watch?v=aaIBsk_kR_k) video with the girls. I thought the dance for Moon was advanced as well. Bvndit are labelmates to Chungha, and have spoken about working to maintain the dance pedigree of the company. Through their title tracks I think all three have shown themselves to be capable of top-level choreography. As for future girl groups, I don't know if this will bring about a rise of more groups with highly-touted dance skills (though I'd like to see it). It may just be part of the natural evolution of idols as the trainee system continues to improve on developing talent. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Vocals**  
Obviously a small sample size from all of the groups, and it's almost a given that their singing ability across the board will improve. That being said, here's what I think of their vocals at the moment.  
&amp;nbsp;

* **CB:** Haeyoon and Bora are the top vocalists of the group, they sing the most and have the most 'vocal moments' in the songs. After them it's Yuju then Jiwon &amp; Mirae. Everyone else just gets basic lines here and there.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Itzy:** I'd say Lia's alone at the top, though Yeji is featured a lot in Dalla Dalla. Everyone else is at a similar level, below those two. Personally I feel like they are a weaker group vocally, but Twice pushed past criticisms of their singing to be successful, and I expect Itzy to do the same. With their dancing they do not need to be a vocal-heavy group anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

* **EG:** Mia is definitely number one, she's kind of hard carrying the group vocally at the moment (D+1 is the clearest example of this). Interesting that E:U is solely rap focused, hopefully she'll give us some good raps on future tracks. For now her small verse on Moon shows promise. Seems like the rest of the group is just okay vocally.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Bvndit:** The best overall vocally out of the four. All members are equally capable, at a better than avg level to boot. The way they switch lines on both Hocus Pocus and My Error is a testament to that.

&amp;nbsp;

Overall vocals are a bit of a mixed bag, with some standouts, some just okay, and most tbd. This will probably always be the case with idol groups, not everyone can become an amazing singer after all. I feel that vocal flexibility is a huge advantage on the music front, so I'm most looking forward to Bvndit continuing to mix it up on their tracks.

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Survival Shows**  

* **CB** - only one member has a survival show background, Haeyoon (final rank #19) who was on PD48
&amp;nbsp;

* **Itzy** - Chaeryeong was on Sixteen, Ryujin was on Mix9 and made the final girl group which lost to the boys (though in the end no one debuted). The biggest Produce connection the group has is that Somi, IOI member and PD101 s1 #1 overall, was most likely going to be in this group (she left JYP a few months before Itzy's debut). Due to Somi's high-profile status the two will probably always be connected, even though she nor Itzy will ever speak about the other.
&amp;nbsp;

* **EG** - Onda(40) was on Idol School, and Sihyeon(27) &amp; Yiren(28) were on PD48. Sihyeon was also on PD101 s1(40). Additionally, in something like a reverse of the Somi-Itzy situation, there is current IZ\*ONE member Choi Yena who is also with Yuehua and could possibly be added to Everglow after IZ\*ONE is finished.
&amp;nbsp;

* **Bvndit** - No members appeared on survival shows, though funnily enough Bvndit may have the biggest connection to them out of all of the groups. There's no question that Chungha, who also made it into IOI back in PD101 s1, has put MNH on the map. She changed the trajectory of not only her own career but the company's as well. Without her solo work the company probably wouldn't even be in a position to debut Bvndit as they are now (though MNH would have gotten off the ground eventually imo). Smartly, MNH has played up the connection between Bvndit and Chungha. Some might even say the group's sound is reminiscent of her's. I think it will help the group attract some attention. For further Produce connections there's also Lee Haeun(48) who appeared on PD48, and Hwang Soyeon(60) who was also on PD48 and signed to mnh recently after being on the show. On the sub there was speculation that one or the other (or both) would be in Bvndit, but that did not happen. It does lead me to wonder whether Bvndit will see a sister group sooner than the other 4.  
&amp;nbsp;

I think survival show connections are worth looking at as we continue to live in a post-produce kpop world. While the produce series obviously has a huge impact on idol groups (who does/doesn't debut, etc.), there still seems to be a path for idols to have success without having to appear on these shows.

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Promotions**  
I just wanted to note that Cherry Bullet are the only ones with a pre-debut reality show, [Insider Channel Cherry Bullet](https://vlive.tv/video/100608). I think it's worth mentioning because it seems like FNC put a decent amount of money into producing it, so hopefully CB will continue to receive strong support from the company.

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Company**  

* **CB** - FNC has definitely taken a hit, with scandals involving members of FTISLAND and CNBLUE. AOA's status is still up in the air, a source of frustration for fans of the group. Plus it's putting a bit of a stigma on Cherry Bullet as some believe AOA is being neglected in favor of the newer group. But there are some positives. N.Flying and SF9 look to be gaining steam, and Seolhyun is still making money for them through CFs. I feel like FNC has some public awareness in Korea, in part because they do more than idol groups. I think Cherry Bullet will see a decent level of support from the company going forward. Also FNC seems to like bands, and some of the girls do play instruments, would FNC try the band sub-unit again?
&amp;nbsp;

* **Itzy** - JYP is obviously in great shape, being home to Twice, GOT7, Stray Kids &amp; more. The only question is how much attention/care will they receive from the company under their new system.
&amp;nbsp;

* **EG** - Yuehua's not been so great on the Korean side. UNIQ kind got shipped to China and now the members are appearing as contestants on survival shows. C-line of WJSN is making money, but not with WJSN. I don't know much about Hyeongseop X Euiwoong but it seems like that project's done for now. Basically Everglow is their first real attempt at establishing themselves in Korea. Whether it will work out is yet to be seen, but at least they have the money to back Everglow for now.
&amp;nbsp;

* **Bvndit** - MNH probably has the most uphill battle out of the 4, Chungha can only do so much to lift the company's profile, but at least the money from her helps support Bvndit. That being said I think Bvndit is the group that could use a hit the most out of the 4. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Size**  
Cherry Bullet is the only big group, with 10 members. Perhaps we'll see a shift back to smaller gg sizes going forward?

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Sound/Look**  
I'll start off by saying that *of course* everyone is x on stage but really y in real life (where x is fierce/sexy/cool/etc and y is cute/soft/dorky/etc), so these points are talking solely about presentation in MVs, performances and things of the like.

&amp;nbsp;

* **CB:** Clearly a youth-oriented concept, which makes sense given they have members on the younger side. They also have cutest concept of the 4, and sound-wise I feel like they're running incredibly close to Twice's wheelhouse. Could they pull out a CU/TT level hit? Probably not. But if Twice does make gradual changes to their sound &amp; style as they get older I could see CB filling the upbeat, bubbly-cute void they would leave behind.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Itzy:** I like to call their style 'In your face' girl crush. It's a *little* more agressive ([watch Chaeryeong sweetly punch you in the face](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PWiM2DuWFsc)) and has the true mark of girl crush, which is a style and message that makes you look cool to young women/girls. Or at least it's supposed to do that. I should note their clothing too, they wear pants a lot more than other girl groups, and avoid high heels. Typically this kind of fashion is seen as a more female-friendly alternative to the cute or sexy styling preferred by guys who just want to look at pretty girls on stage. Not that that's a bad thing, but when seeking more female fans it helps not to cater exclusively to the male gaze. Sound-wise Dalla Dalla is a little bit of a wild ride, and Want It's rock elements give that 'I do what I want' attitude which is also a hallmark of girl crush.

&amp;nbsp;

* **EG:** Concept is pretty much a hybrid of sexy and girl crush. By which I mean they've got the girl crush cool, but the 'men find us attractive' aspect is a little more emphasized than the other groups. And even that coolness is different, especially when contrasted with Itzy. Itzy's cool is like ""they look like fun, I want to hang with them!"" while Everglow's cool is like ""I am simultaneously drawn to and imtimidated by them"". Sound-wise they've already worked with some great producers, it's the kind of edm/synthpop influence that's pretty standard in kpop, but I think they do it well. The use of autotune on Bon Bon Chocolat is a bit of a throwback, perhaps that will continue to be a feature of their music. 

&amp;nbsp;

* **Bvndit:** This group is really interesting to me, considering most groups don't start out with a more mature vibe like they have. I think their concept is most in line with what they're really like. As for their concept, the best way I can describe it is that it's like those TV shows/movies where the main character is a recent college grad living in the big city. They've got that kind of vibe. I could also see Bvndit taking on different sounds, for example My Error leads me to believe they group would do well with R&amp;B-influenced tracks. I'm also curious to see how much they and Chungha overlap sound-wise going forward. Comparing Bvndit and Cherry Bullet, we see how age can determine the concept. Where Cherry Bullet goes cute to fit their youngest members, Bvndit goes more mature since they are older. I believe that if groups that are older than average can find success, then there will be more of them, which will help improve the diversity among girl groups.  
&amp;nbsp;

##Police say that Seungri received prostitution service himself, additional parts of the case confirmed to be investigated still

[@Oh_mes2 summaries that Seungri reportedly called prostitutes to his own home in 2015](https://twitter.com/OH_mes2/status/1126448134064750592?s=19)

[/u/imtooyoung2die translates that an official said he offered prostitution in 2015, and it's hard to confirm if he had offered prostitution multiple times. However there is still room for argument in the Palawan case, so it was not put on the warrant. Only the parts that precisely expose the charge are included. Also police have secured statement from related people that a written contract was made at the end of January (possibly 2018, not clarified in the article) in order to provide a basis for the Burning Sun rent increase, and rent was paid from March 2018 after opening in February. It appears that rent paid after the increase in May is embezzlement. /u/imtooyoung2die also explains how it is clear that sites explain how he received prostitution himself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bllx7i/burning_molka_22_yoochuns_narcotics_case/emvw8k8/)

##The police officer who received bribes to suppress the case of minors entering a club has been arrested.

[/u/imtooyoung2die translates that Lieutenant Yeom who has been previously mentioned received millions of won of bribes in December 2017 through broker Bae, and transferred the case of minors entering the club to prosecution with the opinion of non-indictment. His arrest warrant was issued as he's feared to have destroyed evidence and escape. He's the first police officer to be arrested related to close relationship with Gangnam clubs. Arrest warrant for the sergeant who worked with Yeom was denied, as prosecution deemed it unnecessary to arrest him, looking at the evidence secured.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bllx7i/burning_molka_22_yoochuns_narcotics_case/emvymp3/)

##The arrest warrants filed by the police have been approved by the prosecution and the prosecutor has filed the warrants with the courts. The last stage is for the courts to approve.

What songs would you want to see your favorite groups (or certain groups that have broken up or on hiatus to come back for one single performance video) to fully redo? 

Some I would love to see:

* SEVENTEEN - ""Pretty U"": the whole couch and cute concept would be so fun to see Seventeen do again especially since they have been doing more complex choreography, they grasp all concepts so well 
* NCT U - ""The 7th Sense"": the choreo was already breathtaking as a debut track, i would just love to see them dance it again because they have definitely all grown as performers since they last time they performed this song 
* Super Junior - ""Mr. Simple"" or tbh any of their old songs: all the members are finally done with their military service and they need to perform them old bops 
* f(x) - ""Red Light"", my fav song from and  tbh i wanna see them come back or have like a performance",9,16

1340,2019-05-11,2019,5,11,4,bn2ego,BTS is now (as estimated) the highest selling artist in Gaon Chart history.,imakegraphics,1557515457,"**I worked on this for quite a bit and found NO ARTICLE TALKING ABOUT THIS when this is clearly true.**

As of November 15, 2018 [EXO was the highest selling artist.](https://www.soompi.com/article/1263601wpp/top-10-artists-highest-total-album-sales-since-2010)

Top 3 are:

1. EXO : 10,617,948 (as of Nov 2018)
2. BTS : 9,815,626 (as of Nov 2018)
3. TWICE : 3.7 Million+ (AS OF MAY 2019) [VERIFIED] (YAAAYYYYY!!).

(*Wanna One was a really close no. 4 with 3.57 Million album sales. TWICE recently surpassed them with FANCY YOU.*)

Now, taking BTS and EXO's ONLY major releases numbers (that is the albums that have sales that can actually affect the rankings) SINCE Nov 2018:

**(NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SALES ARE THE SALES THESE BTS and EXO ALBUMS HAVE HAD SINCE NOVEMBER, 2018 TO NOW)**

BTS:

1. Map of the Soul: Persona : 3,229,032
2. Love Yourself : Answer : 165,857
3. Love Yourself : Her : 129,742
4. Love Yourself : Tear : 114,324

Total 'major' sales since November 2018 = 3,638,955

EXO:

1. Love Shot : 505,615
2. Don't Mess Up My Tempo : 256,696
3. The Power of Music : 5,014

Total 'major' sales since November 2018 = 767,325

Thus,

**Total Estimated EXO sales as of May 2019 = 11,385,273**

**Total Estimated BTS sales as of May 2019 = 13,454,581**

I don't think I need to make this more clear but yeah, it is VERY, VERY safe to say that:

**BTS is the now the highest selling artist in Gaon Chart history.**

(*Note that this estimate does NOT include BTS's other albums' combined sales after Nov, 2018 which will actually be easily close to 175K since they sell a LOT long term. On the other hand, researching the chart led me to find that EXO does NOT sell well over time, at least compared to BTS that is. And their combined sales for other albums sales hardly reach around 35K since then. Since the raw difference in these estimates is **2.06 Million copies**, the ranking won't be affected by these sales.*)

--------

*After the reported number from the source below, the new ranking and sales look something like this:*

**Highest selling artists in Gaon Chart history:**

1. BTS   :  14   Million+
2. EXO   : ~11.5 Million
3. TWICE :  3.7  Million+

I personally love reading fan accounts and NCT is .... dare I say... my ult group, and dammit by the end of this fan account they're gonna be ur favs too!! Apologies for the length, I'm dividing this into sections so feel free to skip around (though I'll be putting some advice in each section if you guys are curious about each step). The fancams are some mine some other people's!

&amp;#x200B;

\--**Ticketing + Venue**\--

Honestly when I first found out that they were coming to the Bay Area-- and for TWO nights at that-- AND on my sister's birthday... AND ALL SEATED... I knew the stars were aligning and I had to go all out and get P1. The San Jose theater was the only one that used their own ticketing system-- personally I never have luck with Ticketmaster or AXS so I was actually really happy about this... at first... I had the  impossible task of getting not one but FOUR tickets (for my sister+friends). When actual ticketing came around it was impossible to figure out; It felt like all the P1s disappeared before my very eyes and I was powerless to stop it. Turns out their system is just a little slow and you have to wait a bit for the selection to process and not double click like a [dumb panicky idiot](https://i.imgur.com/qYFmnZe.gifv). So yeah, **Tip 1** If your faves ever go to the San Jose theaters, remember to keep cool and just click ONCE on any tickets you like, since double-clicking will cancel out the selection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, all's well that ends well bc they released more tickets 40 minutes after and I managed to snag pretty excellent seats (4 P1s)-- AND on twitter I saw a girl literally get Row B the day of on the SJ ticketing site. **Tip 2** KEEP CHECKING the site after the initial ticket release, they get released in waves and sometimes payment processing falls through and they get re-released into the fray. The venue itself was very intimate so every seat was a good seat-- THAT SAID I was on the aisle and... omg... **Tip 3** DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE AISLE SEAT. I had a largely unobstructed view for the ENTIRE show. This is the first time IN MY LIFE where my own eyes were better than my phone camera. So yeah, if you're choosing between seats and there's one a few rows down but at the aisle? I'mma just say it. Go for the aisle.

&amp;#x200B;

**--THE CONCERT!!--**

So... and I know this sounds crazy. I think this was The Perfect Concert. How else to I describe it uh. ""Stellar"" ""Riveting"" ""Excellence distilled"" ""Five Stars"". I've been to many kpop concerts but this one had so much polish and like --  Not to tangent but HOLY SHIT THE SET DESIGN WAS PRIMO. I know people are divided on NCT's graphic design but the concert visuals were PERFECT. Very tasteful, not cheesy like concert bgs sometimes are but still fitting them perfectly. The VCRs were God Tier. 0 Mile's video was SO cute and frankly Official MV quality. They had a cringe-funny VCR about being transported back to the 90s and battling eachother in parkas and bucket hats and it had subtitles like ""Got the Horses in the back lol"" (verbatim)... Whoever designed this concert was a fucking genius. I've seen concerts on similar sized stages but NCT made it feel ENORMOUS and grand but still intimate w/ audience interactions. In other words, perfectly executed, u win this round SM.

&amp;#x200B;

I LOVED the Cherry Bomb remix that individually highlighted each member; it was a perfect intro to the concert. The choice to have 1 member out at a time for Limitless was really interesting and kind of awesome. Regular's dance break was also great; almost every title track had a spin on it and made it feel special and just for the concert, not like you were watching the TV performace. The Regular/Irregular interlude felt like being transported to a timeless dimension, like... Idk how Johnny did it but he sent me to the damn Shadow realm just by playing some chords and putting on a jacket. Also, anyone who feels they can't get into NCT should listen to the setlist in its entirety. EVERY SINGLE SONG WAS GOOD. Fly Away with Me, Back 2 U, 0 Mile, Mad City. Also Chain? More like OFF THE... Chain. At one point after what felt like 30 minutes Mark was like ""we're halfway through the concert"" and I was like ""How in the f is that possible"" but that's just how it be when a concert has NO filler. 

&amp;#x200B;

I deliberately didn't spoil myself for the new songs because I wanted them to be a surprise for the concert and... wow... Highway to Heaven and Superhuman Hit Different. Highway to Heaven was a VCR and thank god because if they had performed that one I might've embarrassed myself and burst into tears-- which I basically did for Superhuman LMAO; I'm really excited for this comeback, guys. It's a different direction in terms of title track but the B-Sides are the same excellence I've come to expect from 127. Sidenote but the crowd was off their damn rockers like **Tip 4** Bring earplugs, you'll thank me for this one. NCT kept saying that our screams energized them haha Doyoung at one point was like ""normally by this point of the night I'm tired but you guys are giving me energy"" So big ups to the 5/9 crew (even if y'all did destroy my eardrums)

&amp;#x200B;

SORRY I lied the concert wasn't perfect. What idiot forgets to put Whiplash on the setlist?? Also with all the new songs they actually dropped Sun and Moon... kinda gutted but getting to see Superhuman live made up for it. Also a notable lack of Winwin, unfortunately to be expected but damn bussing it for a real one just ain't the same without him.

&amp;#x200B;

**-- The Members--**

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly? Fansites are stronger than the marines. I literally COULD not focus on a single member for very long because then someone else would pass in front and Id be like OMG focus : CHANGED. Like... the group is so balanced? Everyones so charismatic ??? Imma be honest if Winwin were there it mightve been a different story but the race for 2nd place for me is TIGHT!! Going in (no real) order:

&amp;#x200B;

 Yuta and Taeil were on my side a lot and I really felt a new sense of appreciation for them. Yuta is SO flirty and constantly playing w/ the audience (big ups for always acknowledging the upstairs, he rocket launched those balls to them too, wow). Also lest we forget his [Vampire Knight chemise](https://twitter.com/nastaeyong/status/1126555006809800704) that stole the show. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Taeil is just... damn. A VOICE. And he would just look into the audience with serene but kinda serious energy... like surprisingly intense? Idk his eyes had something behind them, if that makes sense. I was in his line of sight multiple times and it's an [Experience](https://twitter.com/multifandonjuan/status/1126752427888132096). Also s/o to him [Asserting Dominance](https://twitter.com/shbups/status/1126769475552829440) and flexing+yelling as his merch pose

&amp;#x200B;

 Jaehyun... looks like a fansite picture come to life. The SJ crowd was NUTS for him and his deep ass dimples. Like every time he came to our side I thought wow he actually just looks like that. Also I love that his contribution in Mad city after the beginning is to walk around angrily for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

 Johnny was SO cute and smiley the whole night. Imma be honest I was a little worried because I thought since we were the next show after his hometown he might be a lil down abt leaving but he was joking and smiling the WHOLe night and like. The power of Johnnys smile. Kind of a bias wrecker ngl. At one point he pretend cried and the other members (Mark) were like Ohh and then Johnny was like oh I guess its bad timing for this joke (considering he cried on stage like a day ago lol;) but honestly otherwise u wouldnt have been able to tell anything was up. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Mark... and I say this in the best way... has big baby energy. LIKe! HES ADORABLE during one of the ments he was trying to come up with things to talk about and he made some corny joke abt not needing to see the Avengers because were all \~Superhuman\~ and then he repeated it again later and was like Its cheesy but I like it :)  jdhaidnekfb Unfortunately I think Mark doesn't have a solid grasp of time because not only did he say we were halfway through 30 minutes in but he also kept saying \~THIS IS OUR LAST SONG\~ and then performed [a literal 40 minute encore...](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cig0lTJVAAAFsZQ.jpg)  We pointed at eachother (I think??) during Replay during the 'I just want to be loved' part through which I conveyed ""don't worry king u GOT my love and support""... It was meaningful in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

 I wish I saw more of [Haechan](https://twitter.com/multifandonjuan/status/1126755771268472832) and Jungwoo on our side but they were adorable from what I remember. Haechans a cheeky chappie. He's just so mouthy with Mark LOL like he doesnt miss a chance to subtly take the piss. Jungwoo just up and [picked up Taeil](https://twitter.com/taerru/status/1126736859252445185) at the end LOL. He's taken over a lot of Winwin's parts but I'm hoping he get's to shine even more in the future because DAMN that boy [puts in his all.](https://twitter.com/multifandonjuan/status/1126754313974403073) 

&amp;#x200B;

 Doyoung Streep knows how to fucking [EMOTE](https://twitter.com/multifandonjuan/status/1126756611131727872)!  At one point he said he got a really good fortune cookie message and [pulled it out of his pocket to read to us](https://twitter.com/taerru/status/1126721220903202817) LMAO and then failed at translating ""touching the hearts"" in Korean-- ""touch the heart ?"" He also has a charming smile but that is news to no one at this point lol

&amp;#x200B;

 Finally, [Taeyong](https://twitter.com/multifandonjuan/status/1126726856512655360). Tbh Ive always had an inkling abt his personality, and tonight confirmed it. Hes really funny? His sense of humor is kind of different from the other members, like when the Mark said oh here come the old ppl when 95line came out, TY mimed having a walker and said Get out kids!. At the very end of the show, when everyone was leaving he put a rose in his mouth and walked seductively but then tripped and lost the rose and then had to walk off seductively again but w/o his rose... idk how to describe his vibe but its kinda a particular line between being confident and awkward at the same time? Also Yuta (wise as he is) was totally right abt him just wanting to be loved haha. He's also [soo cute with the fans](https://twitter.com/jaebootiful/status/1126731907033489408) lol

&amp;#x200B;

Anddd that's it! If anyone's going to tonight's show (5/10) PLEASE comment and tell me how it is!! Even though I wasn't able to get tickets for both days, I'm almost glad because yesterday was SO perfect I think more people deserve to see it so, Whenever u guys get the chance. GO SEE NCT!!!!!!",25,101

&amp;#x200B;

**Mine**: ***I wasted too much money on a Red Velvet show.***

I live in Norway, and I really wanted to celebrate me finishing my bachelors with a trip somewhere. Red Velvet was touring US at the time (February 19') so I decided that I'd visit New York alone and watch their show. I had to buy show tickets, but everything was sold out on their ticketmaster page, so I went to stubhub. 

Now, I usually say to the people that ask me about the trip that the ticket for their show was cheap - it wasn't, I bought it from a scalper. My trip (Airbnb 5 nights, plane, food, transportation etc) was cheaper in total than the ticket for the show itself.

Basically, how would all the members of your favorite group do if they did a ranking evaluation (assuming they were unknown with the same skill and talent)?

I'm fairly new to the whole 'live performances' situation in the k-pop seen.

I've recently READ that most performances are lip-sync'd and that sometimes they even pre-record their live voices and play it back while performing. 

Now, I'm not used to this seeing as in most other genres / cultures this isn't good, but I've read/heard that for the K-pop scene, this is normal and acceptable and I completely understand this seeing as they are doing much more movement compared to other genre's.

So, I've tried to find mostly LIVE performances of the groups that I know of and am still getting a little confused as to what are Legit Live and what are pre-live and would like your help.

Mainly, just to know how to tell what's legit and what isn't, but if you would like to discuss this, please be my guest, I would love to talk about it :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Please add links to your favourite 100% live performances of K-pop groups, so I can enjoy their live voices :)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks In Advanced y'all",65,26

Their debut single only had 951 copies sold and their comeback around 2,000.

You realise that they arent making money, but since you saw them train so hard for years you decide they deserve another chance.

You decide to give them one more EP, just to see if maybe people will like it. Maybe a miracle will happen. The risk is high, since now youre in a HUGE debt. 

Finally the EP is released and they gain mediocre attention. A total of 100k views in 24 hours. You fall asleep and check the charts, they made it to the char- nvm just another group with a similar title track.

You know what? They havent finished promotions yet! Maybe if people hear the song they might like it. So, you waited and... it didnt work. People didnt notice the group at ALL.

The sales for the first week were 817. Maybe its time for disbandment.

BUT THEN! SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED. Ros of BLACKPINK shared the title track through her Instagram Story and everyone loved the song! Somi decided to share it too, then Kyla of PRISTIN, Jackson of GOT7 and suddenly everyone did. In just a few hours, the song was trending and it hit a million views! The first time EVER for the group.

Once refreshing the chart you hit #1 on all charts and got a RAK. But, what do I do now?",8,0

I also once read this news that BTS is preparing for their comeback, they are currently in the process of selecting the title track of the album. Do they not record the title track knowing that this song will be the title track? What makes a song the title track? Easy to listen? Replay value? Music Video?

You recruit trainees, train them, pick the tops, let some go, recruit more etc. Wouldn't it be cool ? You act as a CEO. I know SM did it with SMRookies but i think it would be really cool to have a game like this..! 

Let me know if there is already existing game like this or liiiike, maybe maybe it could be a project to develop... ? ",6,3

Here's a quick recap of last week. Artists featured included 2YOON, Block B, Dreamcatcher, Spica, and more! The highest rated song of last week was **MAMAMOO's Dcalcomanie** with an overall score of __9.14__, making it our 10th highest rated Jukebox song of all time! Congrats to MAMAMOO!

*This week, on Season 5 of Super Subtle Friends With Love:

A boy and a girl might make it obvious  he's a punk, and she does ballet, what more can I say? He wants her, but she'll never tell, even though secretly  *gasps*  she wants him as well. All her friends have their noses stuck-up to him, and they don't like his baggy clothes. Will the Dream Girl finally get her Naughty SK8R Boy, or will she say ""see you later, boy""? Find out on this week's episode of SSFWL!

Here are this week's songs:

1. [Oh My Girl - The Fifth Season (  )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phXzu7GQAPc)

First time watching with us? Here's some rules: each week there will be seven songs up for review. Leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, please give the song a score between 1 and 10. 1 being this song is as bad as the finale of How I Met Your Mother, and 10 being this song is as good as Season 3 of Avatar: The Last Airbender! If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can also use the MV to inform your overall score  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do feel free to [check out the very first Jukebox thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/).

Song reviews are open up until this Friday at 11:59 PM PST. This is not a strict deadline, but please try to get your song reviews in by then!

That's all for this week! Is our Dream Girl going to miss out? Will that Boy be someone else's now? Can they be more than good friends? Is that going to be how their story ends? Will the Naughty Boy be good enough for our Dream Girl? Will he finally become a superstar slamming his guitar? Will her pretty face see what he's worth? Or is there more than meets the eye? Can they see each other's souls inside? 

And will Oh My Girl continue their streak this week of having all their songs score greater than 8.00? 

Find out and listen to this week's Jukebox songs! Thanks for listening, have fun reviewing and participating, and hope you have a great week!",55,18

But is there any styling and hair on an idol where you just think of them, and a particular style comes up in your mind, no matter the comeback?

For example, whenever anybody talks about Seulgi from Red Velvet, I ALWAYS imagine her in Peek-A-Boo era outfits and black hair. I loved bangs on Seulgi and so it has never left my mind even after comebacks of Power Up and RBB, and I still think of those bangs. It seems jarring whenever I look at picture of her now without bangs.

1613,2019-05-13,2019,5,13,23,bo3wqn,2019 hasnt delivered,halkenburg,1557756371,"I believe kpop has regressed. In 2017 and some of last year, I believe the sound and everything about kpop started improving and it was just booming with great music and choreographies. There was a stage where Id only listen to kpop because there were so many great releases in every month.

All good things come to an end. I believe that the downfall began in the latter stages of 2018. Kpop has just been repetitive, weve seen many groups really be underwhelming. The recent comebacks have been absolutely trash. Theyre releasing low quality music and lazy choreographies. The music is repetitive, theres nothing outstanding about any group comeback this year. 

Kpop isnt about the music anymore, its really just became a matter of clout. 

Theres too many similar groups, every group has the same vibe, no single member stands out from these new groups, they all behave the same way to get clout. Its a shame because we thought kpop can only get better but if anything, its gotten worse. Nobody shows their real personality but rather create fake personalities to attract the audience - its a shame but its obviously fake. 

The new boy groups are trying to be the next BTS, the new girl groups are trying to be the next BLACKPINK or TWICE. By the way they carry themselves on and off the stage. The concepts are dull now.

Kpop just isnt interesting anymore. 

This is my personal opinion anyways, I have significantly lost interest in kpop but I know for some, its only getting better and thats great. I still have respect for groups such as EXO, RV and SHINee as theyre constantly going out of their comfort zone and making sure they deliver something unique and out of the ordinary, not catering their music to what other people want. Thats what I respect. 

Too many groups wanna be safe nowadays with their music and choreographies and I just cant respect that.",25,0

K-Pop band [BTS](https://bts.ibighit.com/eng/profile/index.php) were No 1 in the UK and US music charts in April 2019. Justin Sun's [TRON](https://tron.network/about?lng=en) was ranked No 11 in blockchain at the time. So, what can Crypto learn from Korea's most successful K-Pop export and from blockchain's most brazen self-publicist?

Hey everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about this for a while, and wondered if anyone every had the same thought - admittedly I was too afraid to bring this up as A) I could just be blowing things out of proportion or B) This could rub A LOT of people the wrong way. However, I'm here anyway, and I'd like to bring up something I've noticed in this community. Just a warning, this is mostly my opinion :D

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that whenever you delve into the k pop community on any social media platform, you'll have the people that are there for the music, and the people that are there for because they stan this person or the group they belong to. One group will focus more on the actual music - such as You-tubers like Form of Therapy - and discuss differences groups might be taking or anything really that falls into the nature of just the musical element of Kpop. On the side of the spectrum, there's the stans who focus more on the Idols as individuals as well as the journey of their success and their overall presence in the industry rather than in their music. Now, obviously there's people that can fall into both of these categories, or neither, but that's not my point. My point is I feel some individuals who strictly follow this ' stan culture ', have created this behavior to focus too heavily on a group's success business wise. I've seen people constantly bring up things such as the 100 most beautiful faces list or album sales - things that are irrelevant to the group's content really, and make it an incredibly big deal. IT IS a big deal for a group to excel in any of these, but is it important for a fan to focus so much on this? 

&amp;#x200B;

People have used this information to compare, prioritize, and bash groups that they like/dislike - it's one of the reasons why the community can get so toxic when it clashes with each other. We see that even as I'm writing this people are using the fact that Jennie reached 300 mil. views on Solo prove her worth. Should that be the crowning factor that puts her above everyone else? Should it just be because she put out an amazing song and it reached many people because of it?

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that just putting out great music isn't going to bring fame to all the kpop artists out there, I'm just wondering if focusing on the aspects of them that they probably don't even put on a pedestal as much as we do should be a habit of this community? Should it even be viewed negatively?",20,16

1817,2019-05-15,2019,5,15,9,bor5de,How do you think we can work to end fan wars?,sppwalker,1557881754,"Background on me: I stan BTS and TxT and listen to a couple of songs from a bunch of other groups but dont really follow any of them. 

I want to start this by saying I have nothing against BlackPink or Blinks in general. I dont stan BP but its not because I dislike them or anything like that, I just havent really gotten into them. However, since getting into kpop I have seen a TON of negative interactions between ARMYs and Blinks. Blinks saying BTS arent talented, they dont deserve anything they have, theyre stupid, ugly, etc etc etc and some ARMYs responding by attacking BP. There was a tweet made by a BP fan account that basically said this guy died of cancer because he didnt stan BP and when it went semi-viral and they started getting hate for it, they changed their profile to look like an ARMY account and said in another tweet I did that so those stupid ARMY b*ches would look bad. 

Obviously this does **NOT** represent Blinks in general (and I understand every fandom on the planet has toxic awful fans that do this stuff) but it just puts groups against each other and makes people hesitant to reach out to other groups. I dont know of any beef between BP and BTS so why should their fans fight? 

I used BP and BTS as an example because thats the conflict I, as an ARMY, have observed but this applies to many other groups/fandoms. So how do you think we can work to end this stuff?

So Girls doesn't appear under Rainbow's page, so put their name in korean in the search bar (  ), sort by **albums** and scroll to the bottom of the page and you'll find So Girls and Rainbow Syndrome pt. 1.

## CF Submissions Poll

In our previous Town Hall, we introduced **CF** as a new link flair. However, we do not have established rules for CF submissions for the subreddit. We want to create a clear rule for what kind of 'commercial films' or advertisements can be posted, but there are so many kinds!

Therefore, we set up a detailed poll to find out what type of CF content you want to see in our subreddit. The results will give us more confidence in making CF-related rules that will serve the best interests of /r/kpop.

###Fill out the poll here: [poll.redditkpop.com](http://poll.redditkpop.com/)

**Poll instructions:** The poll will ask you to authenticate with your Reddit account. We are checking that you have accounts that are greater than a year old. We are not logging what your actual Reddit account is. The poll is anonymous, filled with questions and optional answers in multiple choice format.

**The poll will run approximately to the end of May. Make sure you make your voice heard before then!**

While she did not renew her contract with YMC, this album will be promoted and distributed with/under them as her final album under the label.   


I just also want to add that since her last comeback (the 2016 EP *Home*), she has been on several OSTs, CF, and TV shows. Between 2016 to 2018, she released some 15-20 songs under Hyena on the Keyboard, The Call (which has an incoming new season, I think) and several OSTs.

As a result, I feel like there have been lots of chances for people who were not originally fans of an idol/group (for whatever reason) to have possibly jumped ship at this point. If you have, what made you do it?

**This can also include December award show performances** since lots of those were very unique and interesting compared to most of the regular music show/tour stages. Unless you feel it absolutely applicable, try to limit this to just performances/comebacks from this year. While not directly in line with the question, debuts from this year could also count. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me, personally, the group that has made me a fan for this year was Loona. Specifically, Chuu, who has basically completely taken my heart (half-pun intended). I don't want to say I disliked them previously, but I definitely didn't really give them much attention either. Butterfly, though, is just so... beautiful. The song itself is good, but the choreography and the music video for it just overtook me and within a few days I had listened to all of their stuff (solo, subunit, and group) and knew their names. I'm really looking forward to what they have coming. [Also here is possibly one of the happiest videos you'll ever see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTpYn8e9M1A). 

&amp;#x200B;

For individual idols, Sejeong from Gugudan. I still can't get myself into their music (I'm sorry, don't chastise me), but this girl is an incredible vocalist. As to what she did this year, [her singing Taeyeon's ""U R""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6SPz0ueHFc) on Knowing Bros. Those notes are as on pitch and gorgeous as anyone could do. To quote my comment from the original post ""I don't know really know that much about gugudan, but U R is one of my favorite K-Pop songs, and this was really impressive. Those ""You are..."" notes she sang were perfect."" 

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note; As a TWICE/Momo stan, I know that TWICE nor Momo's dancing has ever really been underrated, but seeing all of the overwhelmingly positive comments [from their ""Move"" cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTfzryUBlO0) made me very happy to see.",149,112

Homepage master is fan who follows artists and take pictures or video of them, and upload that on their own SNS or hamepage. Normally they upload on SNS, especially twitter. It is very common things in Korea idol culture. 

Do you know there are some conflicts about this problem between korean armys(BTS fanclub) and internationa armys? It has happened recently and also onging now. International army(IA) says all of armys shouldn't spend master's pictures, video and they have to close their home. So IA sending DM and mentioning to their twitter account. Even some IA terrorized master's SNS account. The reason they did that is because masters are saseng(it is who follows artists and stalking badly). So many BTS master's closed their home, lot of Korean armys get upset to IA.

Korean armys say not all of masters are sasaeng and IA don't have right to make them to close home. They say that is cyberbullying. And IA has misunderstanding about masters.

Again, not much votes as only 121 this time. I'm trying to do one more time to see if I can get more votes as too little votes doesn't seem to make it worth it to continue as the voting pool is too low though. Those who took part in my survey were okay with doing it the same time as Produce X 101 but seems the turnout is significantly much lesser. Not sure also if the boy groups is the case but then the number of people who chose boy groups in the survey is much higher than the one voting now.

Anyway, Here are now the results from 101 to 1.

It will be on this [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/wiki/kpoproduce-2).

It's voting time again. Just like last week, each redditor has up to SEVEN votes each. You can choose to vote lesser than 7 times if you wish. I have reverted back to the previous season's voting, of only including one time voting. That would require people to submit multiple times if they wish. This is to see if it will help or actually make it worse. I make all the voting on one form actually since people said it's easier than submitting so many times. But will revert to last season's style and see how it works.

I'm also extending another week to vote for the Group Evaluation since I have only 20 votes. It's still one vote per person so those who have voted the previous week are not allowed to vote. That also means that elimination now is pushed back one more week to Week 5 instead.

Head [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhd5WSGrxUgvt8En-27EDE1selVFcxQbyBmzLh-j5PprGOpA/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the weekly voting and [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6q8S88YQqlktO8bBm1RARmq2i1ysbcKU1reX02f-INS1WQg/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the group evaluation voting ! You have until 23/05/2019, 7 PM KST to vote!

Do help to upvote this post as well as post your comments about current rankings and groupings. And also remember to google for KPOPRODUCE or check out ""This Week's Stickies"" thread if you can't find the weekly thread! Really hoping for better turnout or I might need to take a break and see if it's better to do it much later. Do give your comments also on if I should continue or not if the voting pool is low. Thanks.",2,18

Hi, my name is JOJO, owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w/featured?view_as=subscriber) I rotate between translating kpop songs and kpop videos. This week is kpop song. I do this to help out kpop community. If you have a song that you want to see translated, please leave a comment.

Some things to consider...

1.One song at a time please. Leaving a link and lyrics would expedite the process.

2.for the sake of time,I do summary translation rather than word by word. My idea is to get the song's meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.

3.It must be a original song with lyrics. So I cannot do live, remix, free style.

4, Ill not translate or reply to any comment where translated song is already on the web. If the current translation is hard to understand, leave a link and Ill check if the lyrics myself before translating

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. good luck!",14,24

#####MelOn daily chart info is missing for all songs and days, except for first day for BET BET and second week for Universe. So this data is likely lower than it should be.  
#####Minhyuns Universe was a pre-release track and charted at release as well. However, for consistency only the past two weeks has been tracked.

Kpop is for crazy obsessive preteen girls

Why would you listen to music in a language you cant understand?

Kpop music sucks

The list goes on and on. How do you personally deal with the negative stigma that Kpop has?

During Lovelyz's ""Ah-Choo"" performance at Seongju Life Culture Festival yesterday (190516), two stage fireworks went off during the chorus. I believed the members were not briefed about this arrangement and were startled by the sudden fireworks, some of them even stopped singing for a moment. Yein was the one who stood particularly close to the machine at that time.

2262,2019-05-18,2019,5,18,6,bpx2qj,In your opinion what is preventing K-pop from becoming more diverse?,tumblrwalked,1558128922,"A couple of weeks ago I saw BoA had uploaded a picture with Crystal Kay who I thought was an up and coming actress. I remembered her from the movie Seoul Searching but was confused on how she knew BoA. Little did I know Crystal Kay is a huge J-Pop star! I had no idea that was even possible.

I am also a fan of 1990's Cantonese films but also did not realize that Leslie Cheung was a popular singer and queer icon. Additionally, there is Li Yuchan who, although I do not know her sexuality, has really been praised because of her gender non-conforming fashion. For people not familiar with Mandopop she is a huge star!

I am more than certain that all these people have faced adversity because of their gender expression and race. They have more than likely been discriminated against because of it. However, the fact they have been able to reach such success in their respective countries is amazing.

I guess my question is what is preventing K-pop from following suit and becoming more racially/gender/sexually diverse?",25,0

The reason I ask is because I'm collecting inspiration photos for a kpop themed photo shoot this weekend. I would love to see some girl crush ones in particular, but looking for any in general.  


Personally, my favorite was the Itzy debut photos with Jennie's solo debut as a close second.",104,31

2334,2019-05-18,2019,5,18,21,bq390z,"What Songs, MVs, Idols, Actors, Etc. Were Pivotal in Your Discovery of Kpop?",Kleha,1558180861," 

Today marks the one year anniversary of my discovery of kpop! (I dont count being weirded out by Gangnam Style in 2012 as a proper introduction, lol.) I didn't plan it this way, but I will be crowning this milestone by seeing BTS tomorrow in NJ (It's gonna be rainy, ARMY, get ready). Today also marks one year since Fake Love was released. This is not a coincidence! The Fake Love MV was the reason I fell down into the kpop rabbit hole in the first place. I have yet to emerge. In short, it was my gateway MV.

As the title suggests, what were the songs, MVs, idols, actors, etc. that first introduced you to kpop or changed the way you thought about or viewed the genre? 

There were three main instances that did this for me:

1. Fake Love MV - BTS.  I saw when DNA was trending on Youtube in March of last year but I did not watch it. The whole idea of kpop was still foreign to me, so I didnt even touch it. It wasnt until May, the day Love Yourself; Tear and the ""Fake Love"" MV were dropped, that I decided to see why it was trending. That decision honestly changed my life.
2. Dont Wanna Cry MV - Seventeen. After being steeped in BTS for over a month, my sister suggested I check out some other groups. She showed me a couple of Seventeen songs, but they didnt really do anything for me at the time. And then I found Dont Wanna Cry. I watched that MV six times in a row! The vocals, dancing, and cinematography blew me away.  Seventeen opened me to that fact that there were many, many other talented groups out there for me to discover. I have found so many amazing groups since then and I listen to many of them.
3. Move MV - Taemin. So, Lee Taemin...dancing Move...my eyes were blessed! But, more importantly, solo artists were now under my radar. I have found some soloists that I now follow eagerly.   

So there ya have it, my big ones.  What about yours?",134,58

I thought this must have been EXO's style but then I saw NCT 127's ""Regular"" and Red Velvet's ""Really Bad Boy"" that brought me to conclude SM's aesthetic. It's very mature, cool, claustrophobic, and a little bit of sexy all combined at once. All of those things can I point and say, ""This is definitely an SM music video!""

With other companies, how would you describe their aesthetic/music video style? Perhaps also describe SM's style better than I can?",26,37

Im following kpop for 4 years now, we can denied how sharp and visually stunning the kpop dance performances are. 

Nonetheless I generally think the choreographer doesnt keep in mind that the group will be singing the song live (at least theyre supposed to..) for years with the same routine.

I know some dance has been changed from the original music video version to suit a live performance (such has Tiffany I Just Wanna Dance or Rose not (always) sliding on the floor in Boombayah). 

But my main issue is for boygroups were i find unrealistic to think they can perform live some hardcore routine. For exemple NCT with Cherry Bomb, where being stable vocally is nearly impossible because of the choreography being hardcore 

Yall thoughts on it ?",11,0

Which artists do you really like that deserve *so* much more? And why?

I'll start: 

Speed: Probably the most criminally underrated bg in the history of Kpop (don't @ me lol). 

Their songs? Total bops. 
Their choreos? Iconique and insanely good. 
Their vocals? that high notes in what u speaks lengths

The highest rated song of last week was **Oh My Girl's The Fifth Season** with an overall score of **8.82**! Congrats to Oh My Girl for, once again, consistently being our highest ranking artist on Jukebox!

And, uh, well, um...now, we get to the uh...sexy songs...

For this *special* edition of Jukebox, I took submissions for _sexy songs_ and uh...boy did y'all deliver. Actually this is probably the most male artist we've ever had on Jukebox at once LMAOOOO well, here's this week's oh so sexy songs:

1.  [MV] [Brown Eyed Girls - Warm Hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflLXh1M-is)
2. [EXO - Playboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXvhnlePPxc)
3. [Jooyoung - Wet (feat. Superbee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzDfe-caCBw)
4. [Taemin - Sexuality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrdtR49x0GY)

7. [Monsta X - Blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THepkNYVjFQ)

Is it your first time? Maybe we should set up some, uh, rules...each week there will be seven songs up for review. Leave your thoughts, opinions, and comments on the song(s) as a reply to the comment with the song in it below. Feel free to say whatever you want! Just remember to be respectful and keep your review to the song itself. Alongside your review, please give the song a score between 1 and 10. 1 being they seem like good friends, and 10 being you have, uh, many THOTs today. If a song has an [MV] tag in front of it, you can also use the MV to inform your overall score  totally optional though, if you want to just review the song by itself then that's okay too! As always, if you are confused about what to do feel free to [check out the very first Jukebox thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/703i6t/jukebox_1_its_a_sweet_sensation_oh_what_a/).

2460,2019-05-20,2019,5,20,6,bqlzz7,"In light of BTS' recent western success, who do you think could make it big there next?",squidwardsghost1,1558299616,"There's no debate anymore.  K-Pop is slowly taking over the West, largely thanks to BTS' recent and well-deserved success.
I myself as a westener am proud that we have slowly begun to be accepting of music and individuals from different cultures and hope that will be a trend that will continue.
So to my question, which K-Pop acts do you think could make it big there next?  And why?  What about them would make them appealing to a western audience?

For me, TXT could be the next big thing in the West.
Of course, being BTS' little brother group, you're going to gain a lot of traction and attention.  But I believe regardless of that, they have a charm to them that would be appealing to westerners.
Their music is very catchy and takes after more to western trends in music.  Outside of that, their choreo is very creative and engaging.
And if they go a similar route with their music to BTS' (as far as symbolism and the message goes), people are going to eat that up honestly.  Because, thankfully music is becoming more ""woke"" nowadays; where people want more than just catchiness and a good beat in a song.
TXT carries a very similar trait to BTS, to where their energy and positivity is just infectious.
There are not many acts right now in the West where goofiness and almost child-like positivity is a focal point in their identity.  So that would help make them somewhat stand out to other music acts.
So for those reasons I believe TXT could be the next big K-Pop act in the West.",2,1

2467,2019-05-20,2019,5,20,8,bqnjh3,I saw BTS in concert last night and am now a stan.,eoljjang,1558307769,"I had the pleasure of seeing BTS in concert last night at MetLife. Ive always been a casual fan of them, and moreso prefer their earlier work; although their latest album is def a hit for me. As a long time fan of Kpop I just had the urge to be able to see at LEAST one group perform in my life time. 

I already had a group of friends who were going to make the drive from NC to NJ to see them and I decided to save up the money to go. 

To sum this all up, I was CRYING at the end of the concert. Everything was perfect. Their charisma, singing, choreo, fan service. It was perfect. 

I purchased the army bomb and had such a fun time just singing along with the fans and just felt connected with everyone in the room. 

Ive always been mostly a Tae fan, but literally EVERY member makes you fall for them somehow. Watching them perform on YouTube does no justice to showcase just how beautiful they are and how powerful they appear when they perform. They literally never missed a beat it was amazing.  

The concert felt like it was 2 seconds. I was screaming at the top of my lungs because I couldnt believe they were actually REAL people. Like here they were. 

10/10 would recommend to anyone. Even dads that looked angry they were there ended up jamming along to BTS in the end.",4,0

Although I am very happy for her, I feel really troubled. Like I wanna cry bc I didnt go, but Im also mad at myself for being mad about not going. Which brings me to this question. Is post-concert depression real? If its just slang and means nothing, then Ill just rant anyway. If it does mean something, lemme tell ya sumn. Post-concert depression is NOTHING compared to actual depression. Sure its sad that its over, but be happy that you went. If you went to a Stray Kids concert, I hope you feel great for going bc you were able to get a ticket(s) despite the hundreds and thousands of fans who cant afford it. Stays, be happy for going and making memories at a Stray Kids concert..because thousands of Stays cant. Post-concert depression isnt real depression. Maybe I ranted about it cause Im diagnosed with depression but either way be careful with what you say about the concerts. Stray Kids want fans to be happy that they came, not sad because its over.",5,0

2600,2019-05-21,2019,5,21,4,bqzx2b,Red Velvet's Wendy Nylon Korea Interview [ENG],Rigby_k,1558379755,"""

**Q. Red Velvet's season, Summer, is fast approaching. How have you spent your time?**

**Wendy**: I (we) did an America tour and received a break. Also, I (we) am (are) currently preparing for the new album. We recorded not long ago.

**Q. Amongst fans, they call you the 'concept-gangster'. You also did a variety of looks today.**

**Wendy**: I like it a lot. Even though I've done many concepts in our promotions, today's pictorial is different. I like to transform into different types of appearances, and it is also my first time doing a pictorial alone. It's a different feeling to what I've done before up till now. I like everything till the point where it is impossible to choose one favorite. (T/N: 'concept-gangster' refers to someone who is able to look good in any concept)

**Q. Amongst the fans, you were picked as the kind\* member. Where did Wendy's kindness come from?**

**Wendy**: My mom gives me lots of love, of which the amount exceeds kindness. My dad is similar too. Thanks to the disposition of my family, I think I just became like that unconsciously. (\*T/N: Adjective used can be explained as kind/warm/friendly. You get it \*wink\* )

**Q. There's nothing you can't do, ranging from singing, dancing, playing instruments and cooking.**

**Wendy**: Nope. Actually, there are lots of things that I can't do. Amongst those, aegyo is really difficult because it's embarrassing. (laughs)

**Q. What do you usually do on rest days?**

**Wendy**: Nowadays, I'm challenging myself in new hobbies. I connect a piano to the computer and listen to a wide variety of instruments, and I am continuously looking for good music. Also, my parents came to Korea for a while, so I meet them almost every day. I like to watch my parents being happy to see me, seems like I've matured a little.

**Q. Do you have any methods of your own you use to maintain your condition during promotion periods?**

**Wendy**: Honestly, I still do not know the method. That's why I'm the type to attempt new things often. I consistently do Pilates to improve my fitness during rest days, I get healing from meeting my family, and I enjoy myself my taking pleasure in looking for good music. I overcome with these methods.

**Q. Are you the type to do your own make-up on normal days?**

**Wendy**: My skin is on the sensitive side, so I don't do the base often. I apply a thin layer of tone up cream, and I only apply a little of blusher and lip (products), just enough to look lively.

**Q.  If you have a favorite beauty item?**

**Wendy**: Blusher and lip (products). Even if they are of similar colors, there are still fine distinctions. The textures are also different. For lip products, I like matte types that have outstanding colors, but my lips are on the dry side, so I mix it with moist products before applying.

**Q. What are your perfume preferences?**

**Wendy**: I'm not the kind who likes a specific type of aroma. Compared to familiar aromas that can be commonly smelt, I like new and unique ones. I'm the type to look up the story behind the perfumes and the perfumer's intentions.

**Q. You're famous for your mochi-like skin.**

**Wendy**: It's passed down well from my parents. My skin tone is taken after my Dad, and the texture after my Mom. I do the fundamental care, but since my skin is sensitive, when there are troubles, I go for professional help instead of home care.

**Q. There are lots of clashes of conflict amongst the fans about whether you're 'wan-puppy or wan-chipmunk'. Which side are you leaning towards now?**

**Wendy**: I think I'm a little less of a wan-chipmunk these days. So maybe wan-puppy now?

**Q. Do you have any plans after today's shooting?**

**Wendy**: I'm going to a caf with the staffs and then do Pilates in the evening. I am also going to meet my parents.

* Date Project Ends: May 22, 2019

Who is NeonPunch?

NeonPunch is a five member girl group signed to A100 Entertainment. The label's first girl group, NeonPunch debuted in June 2018 with the song ""[Moonlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQnm_qvTFNE)"".

Prior to the group's debut, three of the members (Dayeon, Baekah, and Iaan) auditioned for YG's *MixNine,* though only Baekah (under her real name Kim Sua) made it past the auditions. Baekah did extremely well on her time on the show, ranking #22 before being eliminated.

Her most notable performance on MixNine was part of team My9 Me with the song ""[Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dH3GHgv5I8)"".

Soon after the group's debut, Terry decided to take a break for ""personal reasons"", eventually leaving the group in January 2019. She was replaced by Dohee in order to keep the five member lineup intact.

The group's most recent comeback (and first with Dohee) was with the mini album *Watch Out* and accompanying single ""[TicToc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kYuagah3pk)"", which was released January 2019.

You can check out their various SNS pages by clicking [here.](https://kprofiles.com/neon-punch-profile/)

**NOTE:** Chon Yeim, also participated in *MixNine* as a A100 trainee but was not added to NeonPunch after the conclusion of the show.

[**MASC New Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_masc_02/)

* Date Project Ends: May 30, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: No.

Who is MASC?

Whoo boy, getting into the details about MASC is going to be...fun.

So anyway, MASC (which stands for **masc**uline) is a four member boy group signed to Lotus Entertainment. The group debuted under JJ Holic Media (currently known as J Planet Entertainment), with the original lineup consisting of Woosoo, 26, ACE, and Heejae.

The group debuted in August 2016 with the mini album *Strange* and accompanying single [of the same name.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfmGJbqr0k) The group had one more single with the original lineup in 2017 (""Tina"") before J Planet announced the addition of four members to the lineup amidst [the Makestar project](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_masc/summary) for their follow up single was running.

The additional members added to the lineup were Chibin, Doeun, Ireah, and Moonbong, and the group's first release as an eight member group was with the single ""[Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bfiYgnCQrw)"", which was released in October 2017. This would also be their most recent single until this project.

The group was on a de facto hiatus after that release until [news broke out](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207043wpp/mascs-ace-reveals-left-group-physically-assaulting-chibin-chibin-responds) in July 2018 that Chibin had been physically assaulted by ACE after Chibin had posted about the incident (which took place in March 2018) via his Instagram. After much back and forth via social media by Chibin and ACE, JJ Planet [released a statement](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207547wpp/mascs-agency-releases-official-statement-assault-incident-chibins-decision-leave-group) that ACE had been removed from the group after the incident (though ACE's [own statement](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207043wpp/mascs-ace-reveals-left-group-physically-assaulting-chibin-chibin-responds) stated that he left the group voluntarily) and that Chibin had decided to leave the group in June (a month prior to the news breaking out).

While Chibin's legal proceedings against ACE were [in the works](https://www.soompi.com/article/1209895wpp/mascs-chibin-takes-legal-action-ace-provides-additional-information-assault-incident) as of August 2018, nothing had been updated about it since.

26 would then [announce](https://www.soompi.com/article/1207583wpp/mascs-26-announces-departure-group-addresses-assault-incident-ace-chibin) his departure from the group shortly thereafter, wanting to pursue a career as a director (for film and television).

Douen quietly leave the group in October 2018, citing ""personal reasons"" as the reasons behind his departure.

The group's current lineup consists of Woosoo, Heejae, Ireah, and Moonbong.

Some more lighthearted information includes:

* The group's fandom name is MaBling
* Woosoo is friends with Block B's U-Kwon

[**Choi Jin-Hyuk Fan Meeting Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/actor_choijinhyuk_01/) **(Pre-Order)**

* Date Project Ends:  May 31, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Choi Jinhyuk?

Choi Jinhyuk is an actor signed to G-Tree Creative. He is known for his supporting roles in *Gu Family Book* and *The Heirs*, and for his lead roles in *Emergency Couple*, *Pride and Prejudice*, *Tunnel*, *Devilish Charm* and *The Last Empress*.

I wasn't able to find too much else about him outside of his acting credits, but you can check out his [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Jin-hyuk) for a more robust look at his filmography.

[**BLACK6IX 2nd Mini Album Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_black6ix_03/)

* Date Project Ends:  June 4, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is BLACK6IX?

BLACK6IX is a six member boy group signed to Black Hole Entertainment. Their group name is supposedly tied to the idea of a black hole, as their group name reportedly means six boysof infinite possibilities. The group's fanname is blackpearl.

The group debuted in April 2017 with the song ""[Please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSfQ-OjlfXk)"", with their most recent comeback being ""[Swamp of Despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg01r3bVswY)"".

The group also ran a [very successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_black6ix_01/) in the past for their first mini album, making 221.12% above the initial goal. However, their 2nd project for a ""fan-con"" didn't do as well, and was [unable](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_black6ix_02/) to meet their funding goal.

I haven't been able to find too much about the group in English, but I was able to find that member Taeyong is a former I-REX member and Ziki appeared in Mamamoo's ""Piano Man"" MV.

The group has various SNS pages, which can be viewed [here.](http://kprofiles.com/black6ix-members-profile/)

&amp;#x200B;

[**LIMITLESS Debut Support Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_limitless_01/)

* Date Project Ends:  June 5, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is LIMITLESS?

As many people watched both Produce 101 (Season 2) and MixNine - and know of Moonbok's legacy, I'm just going to do a quick summary of LIMITLESS as people are likely familiar with the group's members.

LIMITLESS is a four member group signed to ONO Entertainment. Originally promoting under the pre-debut name ONO BOYZ, the group gained notoriety by participating on survival shows prior to their debut.

Three members of LIMITLESS, Jang Moonbok, Seong Hyunwoo, and Yun Heeseok, participated on the second season of Produce 101. While none of them made it into Wanna One, the members did decently well on the show. Moonbok placed #27, Hyunwoo (who participated as a The Vibe Label trainee) placed #61,  and Heeseok (who participated as a Jellyfish trainee) placed #46.

Lee Huichan (Lee Hwichan), meanwhile, participated on MixNine, though didn't make it past the audition rounds.

In order to keep the survival show hype high, Moonbok had both a solo debut and was a member of a sub-unit with Seong Hyunwoo.

Moonbok held a [successful Makestar](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_jangmoonbok?locale=en) for his first solo album, earning 110.9% over the initial goal. His solo debut was on March 6, 2018 with the release of the album *Peeps.* Meanwhile, he and Hyunwoo debuted as a subunit on December 8, 2017 with the song ""[Don't Be Afraid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xer0eKW3cB8)"".

[**Jinyoung Special Photo book Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/artist_jinyoung_01/)

* Date Project Ends:  June 11, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Jinyoung?

Jung Jinyoung, most notably known as a member of B1A4, is very well known on this sub, both for being a singer and for his producing/writing credits. So if you'd like to know more about him, please [check out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung_Jin-young_(singer)) his wikipedia page.

[**Sunny Hill Comeback Support Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_sunnyhill_01/)

* Date Project Ends:  June 27, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

Who is Sunny Hill?

Sunny Hill is very well known on this sub, so please check out the group's [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Hill) for more info.

&amp;#x200B;

[**We In The Zone Debut Support Project**](https://www.makestar.co/projects/singer_witz_01/)

* Date Project Ends:  June 30, 2019
* Has Project Reached Goal?: Yes.

We In The Zone is a five member group signed to Choon Entertainment. The group previously promoted as WITZ, though now go by the full name of We In The Zone.

The group has some pre-debut hype due to member Shihyun. He auditioned for Produce 101 (Season 2), but had to leave the show early due to health concerns. He was unranked at the time of his departure. He then was in a duo with (former?) labelmate Longguo that was created after JBJ disbanded and Longguo returned to the agency. Shihyun made his official debut as part of the duo on July 31, 2017 with the song ""[the.the.the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmap2sdhgc0)"".

However, as Longguo underwent a scandal late last year, it is assumed the duo is disbanded. This likely allowed Shihyun to audition for the survival show *Under 19*. Although he did not make it into the debut group 1THE9, Shihyun did rank #10 in the finale, which is very respectable. 

While slightly less notable, member Eson has been able to get some idol experience prior to debut, as he is featured on two of Longguo's tracks, ""[Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGXeYwLih-s)"" and ""[To Love Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0ZrLqJXSVc)"".

I am Martin Ong, and I am a junior in high school at Villanova Prep in Ojai, California.  (Yes, I know I just wrote some personal shit, but IDGAF at this point).   
 My parents are very hard at me, and will stop at nothing to make sure that I am studying.  They will constantly whip me, beat me, or even tell me I'm absolutely useless and pointless.  This last Sunday, I told them that I got a B on a test, and they told me that I should go kill myself.  I found this subreddit, and saw that everyone was so supportive for everything.  I am at the point of actually just going AWOL and I want to just run away at this point.  I need help.  Who's in the Ventura County Area (California) who is willing to allow me into your home.  I just want to avoid all the despair, and focus on what's better for me.  This may seem dramatic, but please consider.

Yours Truly- martiniong (Martin Ong)",1,2

Jennie should have never had a solo before an album, and she's clearly his favorite member. I'm a Lisa Stan but its painful to watch videos where Jennie is the star and gets most of the lines. 

YG is a shit guy. The more I read about his dungeon and how he likes to kill people's dreams it's sickening. 

Do you think blackpink or any other successful YG band can make it on another label? Maybe in the US?",9,0

But if you dont mind driving from your hometown that was not listed to one of the places listed then that is fine as well. the age range is going from 13-17.we would start our group officially over the summer. we need a camera man/women, editors, and someone to help with outfits. we would start off as a dance cover group and work our way up to making our own music. we would be performing at events. Also we are going to need to find a place to practice at. You can be a male or female. I just want to have fun doing something i love while meeting new people just like me , you know.

There are some instruments and sounds that are more prominent on my worse/different headphones, and that I actually LIKED when I listened to Black Dress by CLC. This doesnt hold for most songs, but for a song like Black Dress I actually prefer listening to it on the bad ones. 

I love the chorus alot more on the bad ones and it has less of a distinctive deep bass line, which made the song more enjoyable and flows better to me. It sounded less crowded and I could enjoy the singing better.

I say bad because they WERE an awful pair of headphones I had, but it could easily just be another pair that sounded different.",8,17

2729,2019-05-22,2019,5,22,3,brds5t,A real discussion about GOT7 and their stagnant growth.,kruton93,1558462304,"I read a few articles recently about GOT7 and their worries. One thing that stood out the most was this statement from JB: 

&gt; ""There's definitely something to be learned from our hoobaes. That also applies to TWICE. TWICE is well known domestically and I believe we need to follow that. I wonder how we can make ourselves better known domestically....I honestly never thought we lacked in our performance or talent, but I do think that our popularity is lower than we expected.""

&amp;#x200B;

Before I continue, please know I like GOT7, and this is not just random hate.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, GOT7 had EVERYTHING they needed to be on top.

* Resources, power, and publicity of JYP.
* Talent: particularly in dancing and vocals.
* Extremely good looking (best looking boy group IMO).
* Members are all likable, charming, funny, and good at variety.
* Large fan base before debut thanks to JB and Jinyoung in a hit drama.
* Strong debut.

Knowing all this, I think it's quite obvious why they haven't exploded; their music is just not as appealing. Ever since ""If You Do"" in 2015, all their releases have been unmemorable to many, especially those actually living in Korea. They don't have the catchy ear candy that their hits like ""Just Right"" and ""Girls Girls Girls"" had. I don't believe anyone thinks their music is *bad*, but I also believe that most people won't go back to listen to their new releases after hearing it once or twice.

&amp;#x200B;

TWICE is popular in Korea because their songs are extremely catchy, and I'm not just talking about their style of music since i know it's not for everyone; I'm talking about hooks and being memorable. This applies to all of the TOP K-pop groups in Korea, and that expands across all genres. I listened to ECLIPSE the other day and I seriously cannot remember anything about it musically. It's been this way for me for all their recent tracks, and I know I'm not alone since this is the general feedback I see about GOT7.

&amp;#x200B;

I know people HATE when people compare groups, especially BTS, but comparisons are useful when used in context. The fact is that GOT7 and BTS were branded as ""rivals"" around 2015 (7 member boy groups) and one group came out superior. There are a plethora of reasons for this, but the main one is the music. What sucks is that I'm 100% certain that GOT7 thinks about stuff like this too and that's why they feel they are lacking.

GOT7 is clearly comparing themselves to other groups as well since they mention TWICE, but they need to realize hard-work alone is not enough to garner the favor in Korea. I think they should let an outside source create their title track again instead of them producing it themselves if they genuinely want more popularity in Korea.

&amp;#x200B;

The hard decision is this: Should GOT7 change to achieve this goal?

 If GOT7 didn't care about stuff like this, then their current actions are perfectly fine. It's not like they're unsuccessful: they have plenty of fans and make good money. They are not obligated to please everyone, and since they create their own music, it's truly a representation of their own art.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, if they truly want more popularity, they need to accept a shift in style and appeal to the majority of KPOP listeners. It doesn't mean they have to be fake or hate the music they create, but they do need to change *something* musically in order to be as popular as TWICE or EXO.

So my explanation for this is:

1. no promotion from big companies
2. low budget videos
3. just bad songs 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, I mostly care about female artists so maybe the male ones do better who knows but most of this will hardly get 500,00 on youtube ever: 

Eunjung's j-rock solo

The last from Jiyoon (4minute)...Jiyeon too with her Chinese solo (T-ARA), 

Hara's ""wild things"" etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe Minzy is doing better and that's only her 2nd song. I'd say any female artist after disbandment who gets over 5m views should be considered huge success, it's easy while in a group though. I bet Lisa can get 500 million once she comes up with a MV.",60,49

I dont think the traffic to the stadium was too bad. I was 15 minutes away from the stadium and on the day of the concert it took our uber \~50 minutes to get to the stadium.  

&amp;#x200B;

**At the Venue**

Stepping out of the uber and walking towards the stadium I was absolutely shocked about how big it was. This was my first concert ever so I didnt know what to expect, but the stadium blew me away. It was huge and just walking through the gates made it feel like you were a part of something bigger than just yourself. 

We reached the venue at around 6 (concert started at 7:30) and getting though the ticketing gate was pretty easy (although some of yall need to learn to check the rules about bags before getting to the stadium). After getting through the gates we went into the line to pair my Army Bomb to the concert! The line moved pretty quickly and there was only a little confusion about getting in line (there were gaps in the line to make room for people to walk past so it was a little hard to figure out where the line ended, but the staff was really nice and helpful!). Merch and pairing booths were scattered around the stadium so it was nice to traffic not centered in just one area. 

After pairing the Army Bomb we walked into the stadium. It was a little confusing finding the right spot (this was my first time in a stadium) and we accidentally got in a merch line thinking it was a line of people waiting to get to their seats. Once we finally found the right stairs we made it up to our section (140) and got to our seats!! I sat down for a few minutes and looked around the stadium to take in that yeah, this is real and Im going to finally see these amazing artists live!! 

After taking everything in for a minute I back back to get some drinks ($5 for a bottle of water/soda/gatorade is wayyyyy too much imo) and got back to my seats as fast as I could. Looking around at the crowd I was really happy to see just how diverse the crowd was!! I know that some people didnt expect to see just that diverse of a crowd, but it was a happy surprise!!! 

At around 6:45 we were watching everyone come in and watching the music videos playing on the LED screens. As soon as a music video started people started cheering and singing along and it was really fun!! There were a few scattered fan chants going around, but nothing too organized.  

Now, I dont have a lot of room left on my phone and there was no way I would be able to record the entire concert without running out of space. My plan was to live stream/periscope everything on my twitter account so I would be able to record everything and rewatch it whenever I want without worrying about space. Didnt really account for hearing my own voice singing along when I rewatched the videos haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Concert (7:30 - 10:30)**

&amp;#x200B;

*Dionysus*

The absolute fucking best way to start a concert. Everyone was hyped as soon as they started inflating the cheetahs. Im generally a reserved person who has a hard time being outgoing in public (with my friends is a whole other story haha) so I was a little nervous about not being as outwardly excited as others, but as soon the fireworks went off and the boys showed up on the screen all my worries disappeared!!

I was bopping along as soon as the music started and anxiously waiting for the long ohhh wahhhh intro to be over. Like a million fireworks go off and the fire shoots up before the song starts and the boys are on screen owning everything. Looking over my video Im surprised at how much Im singing along to haha. I was 100% gone and this was only the first song. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Not Today*

*Not Today* is amazing live. As soon as Namjoon started doing the intro Im thinking, Damn right. Today is special. Today I can do anything, and I had that same energy throughout the song!

Just watching the boys rap and sing as they walked down the catwalk to the center stage was great. They make just walking seem so cool. When they started dancing there was just so much energy in the stadium that it felt like the boys were leading us into battle haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Ment*

* The Hello, we are BTS, was everything to me
* Namjoons smile after introducing himself is my favorite thing in the world
* Everyone was going absolutely crazy when Hobi was doing his iconic intro. I was screaming along
* Taehyung looked amazing and Ill never get enough of his deep voice, even when hes speaking English. His little dance after introducing himself was too cute
* Yoongis intro was a little short (like Yoongi), but very sweet (again, like Yoongi)
* Kim Seokjin with even a little bit of an exposed forehead is everything. He gave the camera an intense stare before blowing a kiss and then turning sweet and saying \~Hellloooo\~ Im Jiiinnn!!
* Jungkook had such a satisfied smile looking around at the crowd before introducing himself 
* I was shocked by how great Jimins English is! He introduced himself before shouting Were finally having a stadium tour in here. MetLife make some noise!!!
* Hobi had us keep on making louder and louder cheers, Yoongi said were a friendly crowd, Tae said thank you and we purple you and the Army Bombs turned purple, Joon thanked us for the love from the album. Jin called us their wings (tm) and Jungkook and Jin started sping around on stage as if they had wings before they moved onto the song 

&amp;#x200B;

*Outro: Wings*

This song was more chill than *Dionysus* and *Not Today*, but it was still great at hyping everyone up and making us a little emotional at the same time. The boys were having the absolute best time on the stage and even people who didnt know the lyrics were singing along at Flyyyeyyye\~

&amp;#x200B;

*VCR*

This VCR was absolutely the cutest thing ever. I didnt manage to get record a lot of it, but I will never forget an army near me saying Namjooonnnnn!!!! Youre so handsome it should be illegal. Im like 100% sure that the loudest cheers of the concert were when Yeontan made a cameo. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Trivia: Just Dance*

Hobi is amazing to watch on stage. Its so natural for him and his energy immediately transfers to everyone else in the stadium. He looked so cool in the pastel suit with the sunglasses and his natural energy. Everyone burst into a spontaneous chant of Jhope in the middle of the song and the surprise fireworks tied with the water cannons was great.  

&amp;#x200B;

*Euphoria*

Jungkook literals flying above the crowd with a satisfied smile is something Ill never forget. I knew that Jungkook was going to fly over the stage before, but even then as soon as it happened my heart dropped and was put together seeing just how happy he was flying over the crowd and taking everything in. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Serendipity*

Jimin is absolutely amazing. The dance for *Serendipity* is so touching and he does a great job on emoting the feeling of the song into his dance and expression on stage. Im in love with every little thing he does on stage, especially because its obvious just how much effort he puts into his performance. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Trivia: Love*

Namjoon was on the center stage rapping and we were all singing along with everything in our heart. Confetti strips started raining down on us towards the end of the song and only made everyone more hyped. I managed to catch 2!!

&amp;#x200B;

*Boy With Luv*

This was when it started getting darker so the army bombs looked even better bopping along to the song. I can hear myself completely lost in the song singing oh my my my! oh my my my! You got me high so fast. (bad Korean pronunciation) oh my my my! oh my my my! You got me fly so fast. (bad Korean pronunciation) Yoongis rap was amazing and got everyone so hyped and the boys looked so natural and comfortable up on stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Dope*

Amazing. When Namjoon says First time with Bangtan I felt it at my core. The lights rapidly strobed between red blue and rap line had me weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Baepsae*

I got to see *Baepsae* live!!! I've officially lived a complete life!! 

&amp;#x200B;

*Fire*

No matter how many time I see Fire I can never stop being amazed at just how much energy they bring to a song that theyve already performed hundreds of times. It always feels fresh and like the boys are giving it their all. Going from *Dope* to *Baepsae* to *Fire* was otherworldly. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Idol*

*Idol* is a completely different experience live. I was singing along to every line. Taehyungs entire expression during Running man, running man, running man, sends me every single time. Its an amazing song to get lost in. 

&amp;#x200B;

*VCR*

Kim Taehyung. I had to stop typing and rewatch the VCR a few times because I repeat: Kim Taehyung. From the start it seemed like everyone was stuck thinking, Damn. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Singularity*

Taehyungs voice is so special and sultry and its even better with the choreo to the song. This time he didnt have the coat hanger, but he started out on a bed and woke up. The camera repeatedly changed between normal color and a mirrored red and blue version and Tae completely owned the stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Fake Love (Rock Remix)*

I think at this point it was entirely pitch black at the concert and the boys shined even brighter. Everyone was shouting I dont know, nan mola. I dont know why I was singing along to the Korean lines so much because my pronunciation is very poor.  

&amp;#x200B;

*Trivia: Seeaw*

O.M.G. Yoongi made everyone start dancing, even the older people who were a little more stiff during the rest of the concert. I dont even know if they knew it, but they were moving a long to the song as much as armys. It was impossible to turn away from Yoongi, although I did for a second to take in the amazing sight of the tens of thousands of purple army bombs shining in the dark and waving long. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Epiphany*

aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Hearing the chants of Kim Seokjin as the song started was everything to me. Seokjin was on the piano and singing his heart out, and we were there doing the same. His voice is absolutely beautiful live, an international treasure, and hes so expressive on stage. 

The background to the stage was rain, and at one moment the rain stops and starts going up instead of down and everyone immediately started chanting Kim Seokjin faster and faster as he made his way up the stage and started singing his heart out again. The fog lightened up by the light from the LED screens with the army bombs waving in the air, with Seokjins beautiful voice (and my far less beautiful voice singing ahhhh along with him) is the experience of a lifetime. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Truth Untold*

BTSs vocal line is absolutely amazing. This song highlights just how different their voices are, but how beautifully they all come together. For this stage the 4 LED screens were focused on a specific member and didnt change through out the song. The boys gave their absolute all during this song and it was wonderful. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Outro: Tear*

Just going from *The Truth Untold* to *Outro: Tear* is an experience. The lights for this song were all green the boys were completely decked out in Dior with the screens in black and white. Similarly to *The Truth Untold*, just seeing how a rap line of such distinct rappers comes together into an amazing song was great to watch. Even the CGI from when the camera switches from one member to another was great. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Mic Drop*

Kim Namjoon literally had the gall to say This is our last song as if we dont already know lol. All the boys were in Dior and black and white on the LED screens but this time the lights were red instead of green. Ive watched this music video and made the hand movements they make during the dance so many times that it was hard to record and keep my hands stable. When the fireworks go off with the last beat drop I ascended. 

Kim Taehyung in a headband will be the death of me.  

&amp;#x200B;

*Love Yourself: Speak Yourself*

The LED screen was on the tour logo of Love Yourself: Speak Yourself for a few minutes while they got the next stage ready. Most people got up to take pictures, but no one actually thought the concert was over haha. It was a quick break before the last part of the show. 

&amp;#x200B;

*VCR*

This VCR was the boys against the background of the album and with a lot of abstract colors. Reminded me a lot of DNA and it was a great way to lead into Anpanman. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Anpanman*

Here theyre on an inflatable playground playing around and performing at the same time. Its so much fun watching them have so much fun and goof around on the playground. 

&amp;#x200B;

*So What*

*So What* is so great live. Everyone really gets into it and the lines we are we are we are, young and wild and free really hit home. It feels like youre going to live forever. The cute little interactions between Taehyung and Seokjin that they do on every stage are great and absolute fun. This time they gave one another piggy back rides!!!

&amp;#x200B;

*Make it Right*

I dont really know how to best describe this song. Its the boys having fun on stage and having fun interactions with the camera and blowing everyone away at the same time. It makes me feels things about a relationship I was never in haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Ment*

* Jimin said that it was an unforgettable night and I can hear myself absolutely melt in the video
* They took a few pictures with the crowd as the background
* Hobi had us wave our army bombs
* Hobi and Jimin and Namjoon started ribbing on Halsey (Hobi and Jimin (mostly Hobi) kept on repeating I want it and Namjoon said we have Halsey with us tonight)
* Namjoon had Jungkook instruct us on how to wave our army bombs. I think they wanted us to do it with them as they ran up the stage, but we were a lot farther than them haha. After that we made waves with our army bombs along the stadium!
* They kept on repeating that this is the last day of the American tour and making us sad :( 
* Hobi said that he was nervous because this was their first stadium tour, but hes nervous because we made him feel very comfortable!! He also said that theyll be back, that they love us forever, and asked us to please be happy!!
* Tae said that if they come back next year, we have to show up. He wanted to feel that same moment next year. He also said we purple you and dropped his hat and all the army bombs turned purple
* Yoongi said that when he first came to New York he saw a theater that looked familiar and it was the first theater they went to in America. From that small theater to MetLife Stadium. He was the only one who spoke in Korean (had a translator translate it into English) 
* Seokjin blew a kiss to the camera (always on brand). He said that were a family and he loves us 3,000.
* Jimin came on screen and everyone started chanting his name. He said that the journey was truly amazing and that they promise to come back. He also said to always stay amazing and that he loves us all. 
* Jungkook pulled out a roes that Jin and put in his hoodie. He said that he looked up at the clear sky and it got him excited. He also said you smile, I smile and that we made his day. He said that hell always remember the memory. 
* Namjoon had to wait a bit for everyone to stop cheering for him before starting and said that some people say that weve reached the American dream and some say not, but we never dreamed it because it was always considered something that we could never dream of, it was impossible, but the army look at this, we made it together. Dear America, thank for embracing us, thank you for having us, thank you for accepting us. 7 boys from Korea to who sing in Korean and have different looks, speak different languages but you guys proved that music transcends language. This moment and you guys here become our real dream. The most important thing is this moment, breathing with you guys, singing with you guys, just vibign and enjoying the same thing. This moment will forever be my dream, thank you so much. Each one of you have your own life story, we can see countless lights in front of us. And he had us put our cell phone lights up for technology time 

&amp;#x200B;

*Mikrokosmos* 

This song was even more emotional after Namjoons speech. It felt like a goodbye, but a goodbye for now, but dont worry well see each other again. It started off with a simple stage with the boys singing and a sea of lights from armys. Jimins voice is incredible and I want to cry thinking about that moment when I took in just being in that see of light with the boys. Jungkook started crying and the boys waved goodbye and tried to cheer Jungkook up. They bowed to everyone before waving and saying thank you and going down below the stage. Yoongi kept on repeating thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. They kept on waving and smiling and posing in front of the camera and saying that they loved us that it made it made it even harder to see them off!! 

A giant BTS symbol was put on the stage and fireworks started going off as soon as the boys went under the stage (someone on twitter said that they used the fireworks so wed feel less bad about them leaving) and it was so beautiful. They started getting louder and faster before ending. After the fireworks were over everyone sort of took a moment to take everything in before starting to leave!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

Im glad I live streamed the concert because I was able to record so much of it, but my phone kept on cutting in and out so Ill probably save some other fan cams. Getting out of the concert was horrible, uber crashed and it started raining. The line at the Line Friends store was a block long on the day after the concert with all the armys in town.

I'm currently preparing to pitch a documentary on UK kpop fans and how kpop has boomed in the UK over the last few years. The documentary aims to discuss what Kpop means to both Korean and western fans alike, how people got into kpop and how the music &amp; culture is connecting the eastern and western world etc. 

At the moment, I'm looking for London-based super-stans, but  in the future would also expand that search to the rest of the UK!

Let me know if this sounds like anything anyone would be interested in getting involved in!

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-Concert Traffic** 

I dont think the traffic to the stadium was too bad. I was 15 minutes away from the stadium and on the day of the concert it took our uber \~50 minutes to get to the stadium.  

&amp;#x200B;

**At the Venue**

Stepping out of the uber and walking towards the stadium I was absolutely shocked about how big it was. This was my first concert ever so I didnt know what to expect, but the stadium blew me away. It was huge and just walking through the gates made it feel like you were a part of something bigger than just yourself. 

We reached the venue at around 6 (concert started at 7:30) and getting though the ticketing gate was pretty easy (although some of yall need to learn to check the rules about bags before getting to the stadium). After getting through the gates we went into the line to pair my Army Bomb to the concert! The line moved pretty quickly and there was only a little confusion about getting in line (there were gaps in the line to make room for people to walk past so it was a little hard to figure out where the line ended, but the staff was really nice and helpful!). Merch and pairing booths were scattered around the stadium so it was nice to traffic not centered in just one area. 

After pairing the Army Bomb we walked into the stadium. It was a little confusing finding the right spot (this was my first time in a stadium) and we accidentally got in a merch line thinking it was a line of people waiting to get to their seats. Once we finally found the right stairs we made it up to our section (140) and got to our seats!! I sat down for a few minutes and looked around the stadium to take in that yeah, this is real and Im going to finally see the boys live and in person!! 

After taking everything in for a minute I back back to get some drinks ($5 for a bottle of water/soda/gatorade is wayyyyy too much imo) and got back to my seats as fast as I could. Looking around at the crowd I was really happy to see just how diverse the crowd was!! I know that some people didnt expect to see just that diverse of a crowd, but it was a happy surprise!!! 

At around 6:45 we were watching everyone come in and watching the music videos playing on the LED screens. As soon as a music video started people started cheering and singing along and it was really fun!! There were a few scattered fan chants going around, but nothing too organized.  

Now, I dont have a lot of room left on my phone and there was no way I would be able to record the entire concert without running out of space. My plan was to live stream/periscope everything on my twitter account so I would be able to record everything and rewatch it whenever I want without worrying about space. Didnt really account for hearing my own voice singing along when I rewatched the videos haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Concert (7:30 - 10:30)**

&amp;#x200B;

*Dionysus*

The absolute fucking best way to start a concert. Everyone was hyped as soon as they started inflating the cheetahs. Im generally a reserved person who has a hard time being outgoing in public (with my friends is a whole other story haha) so I was a little nervous about not being as outwardly excited as others, but as soon the fireworks went off and the boys showed up on the screen all my worries disappeared!! 

I was bopping along as soon as the music started and anxiously waiting for the long ohhh wahhhh intro to be over. Like a million fireworks go off and the fire shoots up before the song starts and the boys are on screen owning everything. Looking over my video Im surprised at how much Im singing along to haha. I was 100% gone and this was only the first song. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Not Today*

*Not Today* is amazing live. As soon as Namjoon started doing the intro Im thinking, Damn right. Today is special. Today I can do anything, and I had that same energy throughout the song!

Just watching the boys rap and sing as they walked down the catwalk to the center stage was great. They make just walking seem so cool. When they started dancing there was just so much energy in the stadium that it felt like the boys were leading us into battle haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Namjoons smile after introducing himself is my favorite thing in the world
* Everyone was going absolutely crazy when Hobi was doing his iconic intro. I was screaming along
* Taehyung looked amazing and Ill never get enough of his deep voice, even when hes speaking English. His little dance after introducing himself was too cute
* Yoongis intro was a little short (like Yoongi), but very sweet (again, like Yoongi)
* Kim Seokjin with even a little bit of an exposed forehead is everything. He gave the camera an intense stare before blowing a kiss and then turning sweet and saying \~Hellloooo\~ Im Jiiinnn!!
* Jungkook had such a satisfied smile looking around at the crowd before introducing himself 
* I was shocked by how great Jimins English is! He introduced himself before shouting Were finally having a stadium tour in here. MetLife make some noise!!!
* Hobi had us keep on making louder and louder cheers, Yoongi said were a friendly crowd, Tae said thank you and we purple you and the Army Bombs turned purple, Joon thanked us for the love from the album. Jin called us their wings (tm) and Jungkook and Jin started spinning around on stage as if they had wings before they moved onto the song 

&amp;#x200B;

*Outro: Wings*

This song was more chill than *Dionysus* and *Not Today*, but it was still great at hyping everyone up and making us a little emotional at the same time. The boys were having the absolute best time on the stage and even people who didnt know the lyrics were singing along at Flyyyeyyye\~

&amp;#x200B;

VCR

This VCR was absolutely the cutest thing ever. I didnt manage to get record a lot of it, but I will never forget an army near me saying Namjooonnnnn!!!! Youre so handsome it should be illegal. Im also like 100% sure that the loudest cheers of the concert were when Yeontan made a cameo. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Trivia: Just Dance*

Hobi is amazing to watch on stage. Its so natural for him and his energy immediately transfers to everyone else in the stadium. He looked so cool in the pastel suit with the sunglasses and his natural energy. Everyone burst into a spontaneous chant of J-Hope! J-Hope! in the middle of the song and the fireworks tied with the water cannons was great. I felt a little bad for everyone on the floor cause it was starting to get cold around this point too. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Euphoria*

Jungkook literals flying above the crowd with a satisfied smile is something Ill never forget. I knew that Jungkook was going to fly over the stage before the concert started from clips on twitter, but even then as soon as it happened my heart dropped and was put together seeing just how happy he was flying over the crowd and taking everything in. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Serendipity*

Jimin is absolutely amazing. The dance for *Serendipity* is so touching and he does a great job on emoting the feeling of the song into his dance and expression on stage. Im in love with every little thing he does on stage, especially because its obvious just how much effort he puts into his performance. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Trivia: Love*

Namjoon was on the center stage rapping and we were all singing along with everything in our heart. Confetti strips started raining down on us towards the end of the song and only made everyone more hyped. I managed to catch 2!!

&amp;#x200B;

*Boy With Luv*

This was when it started getting darker so the Army Bombs looked even better bopping along to the song. I can hear myself completely lost in the song singing oh my my my! oh my my my! You got me high so fast. (bad Korean pronunciation) oh my my my! oh my my my! You got me fly so fast. (bad Korean pronunciation) Yoongis rap was amazing and got everyone so hyped and the boys looked so natural and comfortable up on stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Dope*

Amazing. When Namjoon says First time with Bangtan I felt it at my core. The lights rapidly strobed between red and blue me weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Baepsae*

I got to see *Baepsae* live!!! I am officially content with life!! The boys had so much raw energy on stage and we were all losing our minds. I hope its on their tour set lists forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Fire*

No matter how many time I see Fire I can never stop being amazed at just how much energy they bring to a song that theyve already performed hundreds of times. It always feels fresh and like the boys are giving it their all. The montage of *Dope* \-&gt; *Baepsae* \-&gt; *Fire* was great and we were only halfway though the concert!!

&amp;#x200B;

*Idol*

Idol is a completely different experience live. I was singing along to every line. Taehyungs entire expression during Running man, running man, running man, sends me every single time. Its an amazing song to get lost in. 

&amp;#x200B;

VCR

Kim Taehyung. I had to stop typing and rewatch the VCR a few times because I repeat: Kim Taehyung. From the start it seemed like everyone was stuck thinking, Damn. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Singularity*

Taehyungs voice is so special and sultry and its even better with the choreo to the song. This time he didnt have the coat hanger, but he started out on a bed and woke up. The camera repeatedly changed between normal color and a mirrored red and blue version and Tae completely owned the stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Fake Love (Rock Remix)*

I think at this point it was entirely pitch black at the concert and the boys shined even brighter. Everyone was shouting I dont know, nan mola. I dont know why I was singing along to the Korean lines so much because my pronunciation is very poor. I was a little surprised that they did the rock remix rather than the original, but I still loved it

&amp;#x200B;

*Trivia: Seeaw*

O.M.G. Yoongi made everyone start dancing, even the older people who were a little more stiff during the rest of the concert. I dont even know if they knew it, but they were moving a long to the song as much as armys. It was impossible to turn away from Yoongi, although I did for a second to take in the amazing sight of the tens of thousands of purple Army Bombs shining in the dark and waving long. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Epiphany*

aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Hearing the chants of Kim Seokjin as the song started was everything to me. Seokjin was on the piano and singing his heart out, and we were there doing the same. His voice is absolutely beautiful live, an international treasure, and hes so expressive on stage. 

The background to the stage was rain, and at one moment the rain stops and starts going up instead of down and everyone immediately started chanting Kim Seokjin faster and faster as he made his way up the stage and started singing his heart out again. The fog lightened up by the light from the LED screens with the Army Bombs waving in the air, with Seokjins beautiful voice (and my far less beautiful voice singing ahhhh along with him) is the experience of a lifetime. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Truth Untold*

BTSs vocal line is absolutely amazing. This song really highlights just how different their voices are, but how beautifully they all come together. For this stage the 4 LED screens were focused on a specific member and didnt change through out the song. The boys gave their absolute all during this song and it was wonderful. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Outro: Tear*

Just going from *The Truth Untold* to *Outro: Tear* is an experience. The lights for this song were all green the boys were completely decked out in Dior with the screens in black and white. Similarly to, just seeing how a rap line of such distinct rappers comes together into an amazing song was great to watch. Even the CGI from when the camera switches from one member to another was great. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mic Drop

Kim Namjoon literally had the gall to say This is our last song as if we dont already know lol. All the boys were in Dior and black and white on the LED screens but this time the lights were red instead of green. Ive watched this music video and made the hand movements they make during the dance so many times that it was hard to record and keep my hands stable. When the fireworks go off with the last beat drop I ascended. 

Kim Taehyung in a headband will be the death of me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Love Yourself: Speak Yourself

The LED screen was on the tour logo of Love Yourself: Speak Yourself for a few minutes while they got the next stage ready. Most people got up to take pictures, but no one actually thought the concert was over haha. It was a quick break before the last part of the show. 

&amp;#x200B;

VCR

This VCR was the boys against the background of the album and with a lot of abstract colors. Reminded me a lot of DNA and it was a great way to lead into *Anpanman*. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Anpanman*

Here theyre on an inflatable playground playing around and performing at the same time. Its so much fun watching them have so much fun and goof around on the playground. It almost doesnt feel like a concert anymore but just us watching the boys have a great time. 

&amp;#x200B;

*So What*

So What is so great live. Everyone really gets into it and the lines we are we are we are, young and wild and free really hit home. It feels like youre going to live forever. The cute little interactions between Taehyung and Seokjin that they do on every stage are great and absolute fun. This time they gave one another piggy back rides!!!

&amp;#x200B;

*Make it Right*

I dont really know how to best describe this song. Its the boys having fun on stage and having fun interactions with the camera and blowing everyone away at the same time. It makes me feels things about a relationship I was never in haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ment

* Jimin said that it was an unforgettable night and I can hear myself absolutely melt in the video
* They took a few pictures with the crowd as the background
* Hobi had us wave our Army Bombs
* Hobi and Jimin and Namjoon started ribbing on Halsey (Hobi and Jimin (mostly Hobi) kept on repeating I want it and Namjoon said we have Halsey with us tonight)
* Namjoon had Jungkook instruct us on how to wave our Army Bombs. I think they wanted us to raise them in sync with them as they ran up the stage, but we were a lot faster than them haha. After that we made waves with our Army Bombs along the stadium! Jungkooks English was really good too! Hes obviously been studying a lot! 
* They kept on repeating that this is the last day of the American tour and making us sad :( 
* Hobi said that he was nervous because this was their first stadium tour, but hes not nervous anymore because we made him feel very comfortable!! He also said that theyll be back, that they love us forever, and asked us to please be happy!!
* Tae said that if they come back next year, we have to show up. He wanted to feel that same moment next year. He also said we purple you and dropped his hat and all the Army Bombs turned purple
* Yoongi spoke in Korean (but there was a live translator) said that when he first came to New York he saw a theater that looked familiar and that he realized it was the first theater they went to in America. From that small theater to MetLife Stadium
* Seokjin blew a kiss to the camera (always on brand). He said that were a family and he loves us 3,000.
* Jimin came on screen and everyone started chanting his name. He said that the journey was truly amazing and that they promise to come back. He also said to always stay amazing and that he loves us all. 
* Jungkook pulled out a rose that Jin and put in his hoodie. He said that earlier that day he looked up at the clear sky and it got him excited. He also said you smile, I smile and that we made his day. He said that hell always remember the memory of that concert. 
* Namjoon had to wait a bit for everyone to stop cheering and chanting Kim Namjoon! Kim Namjoon! before starting and said (rough transcript) some people say that weve reached the American dream and some say not, but we never dreamed it because it was always considered something that we could never dream of, it was impossible, but the army look at this, we made it together. Dear America, thank for embracing us, thank you for having us, thank you for accepting us. 7 boys from Korea to who sing in Korean and have different looks, speak different languages but you guys proved that music transcends language. This moment and you guys here become our real dream. The most important thing is this moment, breathing with you guys, singing with you guys, just vibing and enjoying the same thing. This moment will forever be my dream, thank you so much. Each one of you have your own life story, we can see countless lights in front of us. And he had us put our cell phone lights up for technology time 

&amp;#x200B;

*Mikrokosmos* 

This song was even more emotional after Namjoons speech. It felt like a goodbye, but a goodbye for now, but dont worry well see each other again. It started off with a simple stage with the boys singing and a sea of lights from armys. Jimins voice is incredible and I want to cry thinking about that moment when I took in just being in that ocean of light with the boys. Jungkook started crying and the boys waved goodbye and tried to cheer Jungkook up. They bowed to everyone before waving and saying thank you and going down below the stage. Yoongi kept on repeating thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. They kept on waving and smiling and posing in front of the camera and saying that they loved us that it made it made it even harder to see them off!! 

A giant BTS symbol was put on the stage and fireworks started going off as soon as the boys went under the stage (someone on twitter said that they used the fireworks so wed feel less bad about them leaving) and it was so beautiful. They started getting louder and faster before ending. After the fireworks were over everyone sort of took a moment to take everything in before starting to leave!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Random Thoughts**

Im glad I live streamed the concert because I was able to record so much of it, but my phone kept on cutting in and out so Ill probably save some other fan cams just to have a better reminder of the concert. Getting out of the concert was horrible, the uber app crashed and it started raining. I missed the Game of Thrones finale episode, but I watched it later that night and it was disappointing. The line at the Line Friends store was a block long on the day after the concert with all the armys in town. The next time Im in NYC Im going to recreate all the pictures that they took around the city haha.",12,99

##Prosecution sent inspectors and investigators to Suseo police station and SMPA to perform a search and seizure

[/u/imtooyoung2die translates that prosecution has come forward with a large scale search and seizure on the 15th and took hold of the circumstance that a currently-serving police officer has released crackdown information to the people who run prostituion businesses. However as today is also the day when police publishes the investigation report on the Burning Sun case putting the organization's fate on the line, a response has also come up saying that the start of prosecution's investigation is coincidental. It feels like it's not revealing police's disgrace at the dramatic moment. **More information about who park is, and how its unrelated, and police reaction at source.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/boe2ub/burning_molka_24_seungri_attends_his_arrest/eo3oony/)

##Protests have started

[/u/btsstory translates that protesters 8 civic organizations including the Korea Cyber Sexual Violence Response Center, approached the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in Jongno, Seoul on May 17. At a press conference, they criticized the results of the Burning Sun Scandal investigation, saying that there's no suspiction of collusive relationship between the police and the sex industry, the ""police chief"" superintendent Yoon is also not suspected and the core figures of the Burning Sun club, including Seungri, are roaming the streets freely. Shin Ji-ye (co-chair of the Green Party), who participated in the press conference, claimed that the police, which showed such incompetence at a time when the prosecution and the police investigation conciliation was being discussed, can't have authority to investigate from prosecution. They also urged Min Kap-ryong (the chief of the National Police Agency) and Won Gyeong-hwan (the chief of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency) to resign. Criticism to the police investigation is expected to continue for the time being.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/boe2ub/burning_molka_24_seungri_attends_his_arrest/eo3hmao/)

##There were large protests in front of Blue House over the current results of the Burning Sun investigation

[/u/imtooyoung2die summarizes that women were enraged at the results of the investigation and ruled it as a typical cartel by men. About 1,700 women (estimated by sponsors) protested in front of the mens part of the Blue House on the 19th at 2pm saying the victims are women, all the perpetrators are men, and the the people in power are also men and they let them free - including male perpetrators as celebrities, powerful men implicated in the case, male police officers at Gangnam police station, male civil servants implicated in the Burning Sun case, the legislative body that made laws putting female victims at a disadvantage, and the judicial body that does not punish male perpetrators enough - and call them ""&gt;!rape!&lt; cartel"" as a whole. These women protesters are not from any specific political party or union.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/boe2ub/burning_molka_24_seungri_attends_his_arrest/eo3r9fg/)

Some that come to mind are:

* Kesha - Run Devil Run (SNSD)
* Bebe Rexha - Lucifer (SHINee)
* Carly Rae Jepsen - When I'm Alone (f(x)
* Kim Petras - Young and Wild (TWICE)
* Charli XCX &amp; MNEK - Girls Like Us (TWICE)
* Ed Sheeran - Make it Right (BTS)
* Halsey technically counts cuz she's featured on Boy With Luv but also probably wrote her lyrics, and she's credited so

Song: EXO - Tempo

I went through a period where I didnt listen to much kpop for a few years, so I missed a lot of comebacks. When I got back into it, I just skipped to the most current comebacks for the groups I knew of. That was a huge mistake. Tempo is a masterpiece and is easily one of my favorite kpop songs of the past year &amp; probably ever.

So today at school was playing basketball and all of a sudden this big white car passes by and slows down quite a lot. I look in the car and there's an man and lady and I swear they're looking right at me. I stared for a couple seconds then continued playing and like twenty seconds later I look and they barely moved (they were driving real slow) and i'm like what okay this is creepy. However soon after they leave and i'm like okay thats good.
BUT then 20 mins later, they come back and the lady and guy pull up and leave the car. They approach only me and ignore my other friends and the guy is like ""Hey, do you know the band bts?""
and I reply ""yeah its the kpop group"" (I'm not familiar with kpop at all but I definitely recognize popular names)
So hes like ""oh cool, we are from the label that manages BTS and we would like to invite you to an audition this Saturday for modeling singing, dancing or acting, we really like your image and encourage you to come, can you give us your contact information? We will message you with details.'
then im like ""uhh okay""
We talked a bit more about my background and had some cool convo.
I thought it was a scam, the largest red flag being they contacted me through Facebook and did not hand me any sort of business card but I searched them up and the audition is real (I was unaware of this audition before).
I'm not really sure what to make of this over strange encounter but this opportunity sounds exciting, any advice or comments from anyone?

Also both ambassadors we're extremely friendly and cool (I hope I didn't make them seem like bad people!)

So yeah that's the end please tell me what you guys think.",108,272

It was horrible back then to try and support groups from the U.S. as the internet was still shiny and new, there were no online music stores like itunes or Google play or streaming music sites, and if you were lucky enough to live near a Korean store of any kind, you were limited by their generally tiny, tiny stock of CDs or tapes, if they even carried music. Online shopping was still getting off the ground.

My sister and I were teens then and dreamed of the day when Kpop would be easier to get ahold of and enjoy. Wouldn't it be amazing, we thought, if someday music that wasn't even in English would be something you could easily obtain here? If people would give it a chance? Hahaha, yeah, that'll be the day, we thought. We'll never see that happen in our lifetimes.

Today I was at Target and to my shock, there was an entire shelf of BTS's new album prominently displayed on an endcap. You could have knocked me over with a feather.

Funny how our dreams come true.

I've been a fan of g idle for a few months but I've noticed the general lesser # of likes/comments in group photos compared to (certain) individual/2/3 member posts. Generally, group photos get more or equal likes than individual posts for groups that only have a group account. (This pattern is broken in group photos w/ awards and birthday posts and just a few posts that tbh are really aesthetic or cool; everyone has their golden posts every once in a while lol)

I know ig and likes/comments are more ""indicators"" than fact (plus I think most chinese fans are out of the equation bc weibo), and I also know it's inevitable for member popularity disparity, which tbh usually gets less noticeable when the group becomes ultra popular (aka bts lmao, don't quote me i don't follow bts nearly as much). Anyways, I just wanted other people's opinion on this trend and their thoughts on if this should be considered as implications of a perhaps lesser fanbase of the group as a whole in the present/future. I'm more worried bc this can dampen more individual activities specifically solo debuts (someone like soyeon is definitely suitable for solo projects - ik she debuted before - but at this rate, she can only get so far  unless she hits it big)

However, trends can reverse (which is my hope) and I believe a comeback would always help but I think they're going for a japanese debut first which to be frank doesn't help popularity growth in korea and int'l  + I know a fair bit of korean so japanese songs aren't really my thing.. but that's just me

3125,2019-05-24,2019,5,24,19,bsfc05,K-POP is not mainstream,adfsafsafsafasf,1558694381,"So I've been checking out K-pop recently because my parents were talking so much about how BTS is such a big deal and how they're so famous.

Now I do want the best for K-pop as a Korean. But as I read around a bit about the subject, there seems to be frequent use of hyperbole when describing K-pop. Like how K-pop ""conquered the world"" or it is a global phenomenon.

What they often cite is a curious number of $5 billion. That the industry is worth $5 billion. Or some say that that is their annual revenue. I was a little skeptical. So I searched annual revenue of the 4 biggest K-pop entertainment companies and found out that each company only generates revenue between $100~$350 million, which barely surpasses even half of $1 billion. Maybe the companies' net worth builds up to $5 billion. Certainly not revenue. According to research done on the global music market, annual revenue of all music sales is $19 billion in the same year. So K-pop has about 3~5% of the global music market. Which is admirable but hardly something to write home about.

Furthermore, I've checked out the music charts of countries that are supposedly 'obsessed' with K-pop or at least have a solid following: Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, the US, the UK, Germany, France, Russia, Mexico and Brazil. What I discovered was more or less what I've suspected. Music charts from Southeast Asia, China, Taiwan, Europe are dominated with American artists in the top spots. The only K-pop artists in the top 100 were BTS and BlackPink. And it was only one or at most a couple of songs. In Thailand and the Philippines, there were a few more but even there, they were dwarfed by American artists. Interestingly with Mexico and Brazil, most of the spots were occupied by Spanish or Portuguese sounding names with about 3~5 American and 1 BTS song. In Japan, there seems to be about a dozen from BTS, BlackPink, Twice, and just a couple of others.

Now *mainstream* suggests that it is the dominant music in the market. K-pop is one of 3 types of music that breaks into the charts of countries all over the world, alongside American and the UK. Which is pretty impressive. But British and Korean get completely dominated by American music and their presence is limited to 3 at most for most countries. (None for European countries outside of the UK) That's not really mainstream. That's barely 'popular'. In stark contrast, almost every single name in Korean music charts are Korean and American music dominates about 50% of every music charts in the world (minus Latin America). THAT's mainstream. But the illusion that K-pop is as big as I was told it is by the articles I've read and from other Koreans are mostly dissipated. 

I wish K-pop all the success in the future and that's why I so obsessively researched it. It is certainly impressive but the hype is much louder than the substance.",13,0

Full Message from Kyla on IG:

Dear HIghs, 
I am so devastated that I have to be uploading this post and I know that so many of you have a million questions. For now, I just want to say I am so sorry and also incredibly grateful to all of you who have supported us from the beginning from when we were Pledis Girlz to now. While Pristin has officially disbanded, I would like to ask you all not to be upset and angry, but rather joyous of the memories that we've had together and all of the amazing things we have accomplished. Moving forward, I hope you all will find it in your hearts to support me as Kyla Massie instead of Pristin Kyla. I had been with Pledis for approximately 9 years now and I am very lucky to have had this amazing experience and to have had such a wonderful second family. Thank you. It has been a rollercoaster ride the past 2 years and I couldn't be more grateful to all of the people who have supported us over this time. Thank you so much. I love you with all of my heart.   .

Twitter Message:

This year my choices are between ""Monologue"" by Taemin, ""She's In The Rain"" by The Rose, ""Time"" by Gaho, or ""Heart Is Beating"" by Gaho. My range isn't great with any of these, but female songs are too high. Which of these do you like? Or is there another song I should look at?

   So my first Kpop groups I stumbled upon by accident , was big bang and 2ne1, they made a song called lollipop. And at first I actually didnt like it.... then it just stuck in my head, at first I was drawn to 2ne1 because of Park Bom. Idk why, but I liked her voice a lot! I searched up 2ne1 and her and boom! I was into kpop like that lol, Ive heard most of the 2nd generation songs. Snsd, shinee,Girls day, sistar,4minute,secret, after school.... God I miss the old days ... they all you to bang...


BACK To TOPIC.
At first I straight up did not like Blackpink...  I refused, I felt so hurt as a 2ne1 fan that they (YG) just threw them away like trash and made a new, prettier and better group... which compared to 2ne1 there NOT.... and they still got Big Bang ... even tho most are in the military... shit there still a group under them, except for Seungri.... but still man...
Example, when boombaya or however its spelt , when it came out I couldnt pay attention to how good it was or sounded, I probably didnt listen to anymore black songs until KILL THIS LOVE literally. Thats when I was like hmmm..... LOL ... this is pretty good. I like kill this love and as if its your last but thats all... 
just was sharing it was a process to like them NOT because of them as a person ... just YG lol my favorite I think is Rose tbh, Im a vocal person , I usually like the vocialist in the group.

Also I havent really listened to ANY new kpop... like




SUGGESTIONS?!?!?!



Cause  I like kpop but ugh it so different now... i like Itzy and ummmmm red velvet but Ive literally only heard there song ,dumb dumb, ice cream cake , and that first song happiness. Once all the groups were disbanding , I was like.... wtf am I gonna listen to lol...",1,0

Not all numbers are pulled on the same date.  If you want to do more advanced sorting than what reddit allows, please copy the table into Excel and sort to your heart's content.

As you probably know, Google Translate doesn't always play nicely with Korean to English and I'm not necessarily up on the correct name for every release.  (For instance, for WJSN it gives me Space Girls or for Ryewook's latest album it gives me Drunk to You instead of Drunk on Love).  So if there's something wonky below, please let me know so I can update it.

There is a soft cut off for albums selling under 5K, for sanity's sake.  I'm still pulling out albums that I know you guys might be interested in (like debuting girl groups!), but I don't know every group out there.  If there is *new release* that I missed and you want to know if it's there, please request in the comments.

3226,2019-05-25,2019,5,25,19,bssvy1,I think the way that this sub handles rumours is very irresponsible.,reverentreverer,1558778536,"I lurked for several months before creating this account and something I noticed that really bothers me is how lazy and dangerous this sub is with allowing rumours to get posted.

It seems like nobody checks the veracity of these rumours a lot of the time, a lot of the time it seems click bait and it's no coincidence that the rumours that get most attention are ones that rely on ethnic tensions or serious career decisions and every time a big one comes up it feels closer and closer to brewing up a witch hunt by fans.

But despite how serious some of these rumours are this sub doesn't seem to have policies to temper them. Apparently it doesn't matter how sketchy the outlet is that's reporting the story (still allowing AKP to be posted, not caring that Koreaboo has a long record of mistranslations and falsifying stories for clicks, and there's no double checking or stickying other translations either. By the time things get corrected a lot of damage has already been done and this sub just moves on its merry way to the next thing acting like it didn't have a part to play.

Currently there's a thread up about a rumour that WinWin from NCT isn't allowed to do solo dances or singing. Of course it's full of people clamouring that this is OBVIOUSLY discrimination because he's Chinese and SM being racist and using idols like slaves. But there are also people trying to point out that the entire story comes from one post Chinese post by WinWin fans, is very poorly translated, has incorrect facts, and doesn't even make sense because other Chinese and foreign idols are allowed to perform and WinWin has done solo performances before, actually it might be that the show he is currently on hasn't paid the fee for him to perform and the fact is that he might have been debuted for visual purposes which fans might not like but which isn't a crime or even uncommon in kpop (think of Sehun or Kiseop or Jaehyo). Given the sentiments it's very easy for them to get drowned out by the herd of people just reading the headline and confirming their own biases and looking at the trend of posts in that thread they are being drowned out.

It's stupid and it's irresponsible. Fans can carry a lot of power in kpop and fans spreading false information or heavily warped versions of the facts about something can only make a situation worse. This sub should make more of an effort to verify rumours and make sure other translations and clarifications of things are very visible, not an after thought. Especially because this sub is already a hub of false facts and forced Western perspective on Eastern things, the ignorance and outright lies about Eastern politics, cultures, and countries on this sub and the experiences of Asian people in general is shocking and falls into racism far more often than people will own up to. 

The way this sub handled Burning Sun news should be an example for how it handles all rumours or one day we're going to see someone's career ruined partly because of something spread here and everyone's just going to ask how it happened because surely it couldn't have been us. It doesn't matter that something isn't as important as that scandal, it still affects peoples lives and care should be taken to make sure people aren't getting fed false news or allowed to astroturf a topic to sway opinions about something.",29,61

3262,2019-05-26,2019,5,26,1,bsw5sq,I'm so into Kpop that I need a place to discuss further that just fan-war or idol's fact,fluffy_blackat,1558800415,"Because I don't know anyone understand Kpop as I do. So here the point:  
I'm kind of a SM-stan, I like how they manage their business.  JYP is more marketable: make a group with visual position, vocal and stuff, a certain concept with OK songs... just basic things. YG is just living for the past with Big Bang and 2NE1, now Blackpink is both overrated and overhyped, just visual and trendy concept, Winner and iKON is doing fine but YG has no impact on them. 

But this is how SM works: find trainee by their visual or *super* talent, train hard af, eliminate anyone can't reach the standard, so when they debut, there're just crazy-talented one and decent talented with good visual one. Plus they always have the best musical-wise songs, but never be the public's taste. But SM don't care, SM just need great music performed by great people, they'll have the money back from the huge fanbase anyway. SM's group always have big fanbase because their visual. Such a cycle, how smart ! 

I mean they could easily make marketable songs, but they don't, that means they want to invest in music more than just making money. 

But it seems to go too far with NCT. They debuted 3 years ago but never be given a marketable song, compare to EXO's Growl came only 1 year after debut. NCT's songs keep doing better and better musically, but NCT don't get any fame by those (I know NCT is pretty famous in America but it's more about their lifes or concept or talent than the song itself).   
I think I'm annoyed by Korean keep asking who NCT is or thinking NCT is famous in US because they're SM. I wish they soon have a hit song and rise even faster.  
Off the subject but is it weird that I enjoy both NCT's and Seventeen's songs? They seems to be opposite.",4,0

You may have been indifferent or an outright hater of a certain soloist/idol/group, but now youre a fan or at least have come to like them.

In my case, its IU. Ive always known shes a great singer and all (thanks to Dream High), but Im not one to appreciate high notes + soloists in general.

Flashback 2015, her 23 comeback coincided with f(x)s 4 Walls. Since I was (still am... ) an f(x) fan, I read and watched stuff about them while promoting, so I naturally came across IUs IMO nonsensical pedophilia scandal.

I got curious, so I scoured through articles about the issue to fully get a context of why she was being branded. I listened to the song in question (this version of [Zeze](https://youtu.be/zfRs5hJuh98) in particular) and... loved it... and I will forever raise an eyebrow at people who came into such a warped conclusion.

Anyhow, Ive been following her since then, and  is my current favorite Korean song.

Calling myself a Uaena is a reach, but she has certainly earned my respect and Ill be looking forward to hear her more and more from her.

**TLDR** thanks to a scandal, I saw IU as a genius.",14,6

3332,2019-05-26,2019,5,26,22,bt7n41,Michael Jacksons legacy in K-Pop,MrNovator,1558875600,"Just a thought that crossed my mind: Nowadays, I feel like MJ has more influence on Korean artists than on western ones. One reason for which people appreciated Jackson so much was because of his clips. They were well-crafted and did a good job of showcasing the choreography. The dancing was really highlighted, it had some weight in the final product (check the Smooth Criminals dance sequence, its absolutely mesmerizing). 

In the recent western pop clips that Ive checked, dancing has a reduced importance. Even artists with excellent skills like Chris Brown tend to treat it like a side element. And the general quality of the routines is nowhere near as good as what the King of Pop used to execute.
Meanwhile, the korean clips keep putting emphasis on the dances. In a typical idol MV, there are phases where the group goes full dancing, like look at how cool we and our routine are.  Just like MJ did. And we get dance practices, every idol must reach a minimum level in order to succeed, choreographers have plenty of work to do ...

Im no music industry expert, so Ive probably missed some stuff. Maybe I didnt check enough western artists. Its not a comparison to say one is better than the other. I just think its a bit curious how one of the greatest western artists legacy feels more alive in a country far away (and with a different culture) than in the musical industry where he worked. What are your thoughts on it everyone ?",53,21

Is it because they are korean?
I remember one time in primary school i had put on a kpop song (hellavator by stray kids). At the time this song was very up-lifting for me, i don't know everything especially the rapping really hit me with a bang. I had put it on because it was rap and i knew everyone loved rap in my class. One of my classmates had started making fun of the members for wearing earrings and makeup and everyone had laughed with him. It had really hurt my feelings and i just started crying. Since then i knew that everyone in my class was so close-minded except my best friends, they were very accepting. Kpop has made my life feel more filled and less empty. Kpop has definitely made a massive impact on my life. I feel much more happier. Watching kpop idols going through hardships really hits my heart. Being in fandoms with incredibly kind people really makes me feel welcome. Seeing multiple fans from different fandoms come together as one big family really feels surreal. Watching trainees working hard to debut and seeing them embark on their journey of being a kpop idol is truly inspiring.
Kpop isn't just a sub-genre of music it's a family of talented musicians who sing for their dedicated fans. I don't care if i can't understand korean because all music speaks in its own language that everyone can understand.",1,1

First off, thank you everyone who gave me advice, this sub is super welcoming and friendly. Secondly, I decided to go through with the audition and hey guess what, I made it back without getting kidnapped :D

The overall experience was super fun and i'm really glad that I decided to go. I met some great people i'll call J and E and surprisingly I recognized a few people auditioning there as well. Funny enough, it turns out both the people that approached me were judges and they recognized me when I walked into the audition room with one of them even commenting ""hey look you came"".

Here are some unimportant details for those of you who are curious about the audition process. When you first arrive at the venue, you are greeted by someone outside the door guiding inside the right building. The place was a fairly decent sized studio and you first go into a general waiting room where you fill out an online survey in order to sign up. For some reason, my phone had a lot of trouble signing up and the two new people I met J and E were nice enough to lend me their phones.  Next, we waited in line for our turns to audition. I was humming and beatboxing and J asked if I was that guy that posted on reddit as he remembered me mentioning something about beatboxing and Jeez this is a small world.

I think my audition went alright, it was a pretty quick 2 mins. A friend I went with asked about the odds of making it to the next round and they said 0-2 people will probably go on (0 lol). If I remember right we'll all be contacted in three weeks. Not to let you guys down but i'm really just an average guy!! Shout out to J and E if you're reading this. This will probably my last post on this sub so thank you guys for reading this and yupp, cya!

 **tl;dr** This was a super fun experience and i'd like to thank everyone for giving me advice and encouraging me to go.",70,580

## CF Submissions Poll

In our previous Town Hall, we introduced **CF** as a new link flair. However, we do not have established rules for CF submissions for the subreddit. We want to create clear rules for what kind of 'commercial films' or advertisements can be posted, but there are so many kinds!

Therefore, we set up a detailed poll to find out what type of CF content you want to see in our subreddit. The results will give us more confidence in making CF-related rules that will serve the best interests of /r/kpop.

###Fill out the poll here: [poll.redditkpop.com](http://poll.redditkpop.com/)

**Poll instructions:** The poll will ask you to authenticate with your Reddit account. We are checking that you have accounts that are greater than a year old. We are not logging what your actual Reddit account is. The poll is anonymous, filled with questions and optional answers in multiple choice format.

####The poll will only be open for a couple more days! The results and any rules rendered from them will be announced in the upcoming June Town Hall",20,20

Have a K-pop question that you need answered?  Ask away!

There are only two rules.

Hi, my name is JOJO owner of [thisguykpops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpHDAvNDsFQ8bMzVFI5t_w?view_as=subscriber). I rotate between translating kpop song and kpop video. This week is kpop videos.

\- Anything within 1 minute, i will translate word for word.

\- Anything within 3 minutes, Ill do summary translation. This means a video might have 1 minute worth of conversation spread in 3 minutes, not straight 3 min Q&amp;A that i'm going to summarize.

\- Will not translate anything outside of 3 minutes.

1. One video at a time. please leave a link so i can view the video.
2. no songs, I rotate between the two, so wait for next week for song request.
3. It must include a link I can look into, not ""I remember this one clip...""
4. If I have not replied to your post, its b/c you broke one of the three rules

Be back in 48-72 hours to check. Good luck!",15,16

[Former YG rapper Prhymes Post Exposing YG Entertainment Resurfaces In Light Of Recent Controversy-Koreaboo](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/prhyme-rapper-expose-yg-entertainment-yang-hyun-suk-post-resurface-recent-controversy/)

##Burning Sun co-CEO Lee Sung Hyun testified to court that he sent 20 million won to a former police officer Kang in order to supress the case of minors entering Burning Sun last year

[/u/imtooyoung2die translates that he did not report it to Seungri, and that Kang used to work at Gangnam police station and denied that he received money from Lee.But Lee testified that, on July 25th last year, Kang asked him for money, and he sent 3 million won to Kang on August 9th, and again 17 million won on August 17th. Lee told this to co-CEO Lee Moon Ho and not Seungri, saying he's not in the position to report to Seungri. When it was pointed out that there was no proof of sending 20 million won, he said that back then everybody knew that Kang turned a blind eye at the case, and he didn't think that (Seungri) would believe that he paid for it, knowing how big the damage is if they're stopped from doing business. Lee said he simply made the statement faithfully, saying it's just a mistake of tracing his memory that his statement changed a few times, when asked by his lawyer if he was forced to made a false statement.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/bs07pm/burning_molka_25_multiple_burning_sun_protests/ep2r7kk/)

##A Rumor started that Mnet was boycotting YG, This is not true and is not an official Mnet statement.

Mnet gallery is a fan forum, and the message was posted by a user who was not even logged in. Somehow it circulated on Twitter and then to Koreaboo indicating that Mnet themselves were boycotting YG. An Mnet Gallery manager has indicated that it's not related to them/Mnet proper. 

Logically, and practically speaking, if Mnet was going to boycott YG, they would not declare it on a random fandom board that no one besides it's users have heard of until today, and would hold a press conference or do a news release instead.

# FAQ

### How The Chart Works:
These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

[Here is a link](https://github.com/mattfwood/weekly-lastfm-charts) to the source code, which I'll do my best to keep documented and up to date.

### How Can I Join?

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit is a bit different due to it having rules and also some questions are not exclusive to k-pop but pop in general.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Why do you become obsessed about certain people?

When I look at some YT comments they act like x person is their lord and savior. Ex ""when x person is happy i'm happy""

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you act so toxic towards people who like different groups?

&amp;#x200B;

What makes the music special?

It just feels like I've heard it before but that is just a thing with pop in general. Or do you just like to listen to your ""idols""

&amp;#x200B;

The cringe:

I really don't like using this word but in some situations like this it's almost necessary.

3627,2019-05-29,2019,5,29,0,bu1d3e,Why is the use of English in song titles so much better than in lyrics?,zakuropan,1559057234,"Okay, so I'm a bit of a language nerd. I've long since gotten used to (and dare I say come to appreciate) the prevalence of random English words sprinkled throughout lyrics that make little grammatical or sometimes even thematic sense.  

However, something that's occurred to me recently is how a fair amount of English song titles for kpop songs are actually really good. They're not only grammatically correct, they're evocative and nuanced in ways my English lit teacher would appreciate. I'm not even talking song names like ""Vibrato"" and ""Lucifer"" that have pretty English words but are straightforward in meaning.  There's some titles like ""Dope"", ""Hard Carry"" and ""Kingdom Come"" that just fill me with satisfaction at how succinct and evocative they are. They're current and idiomatic in ways that successfully translate to Western relevance, yet surprisingly they effectively convey the essence of songs written for another language and culture entirely. 

Whereas in the actual song lyrics, we're graced with literary masterpieces such as ""I'm genie for your wish"" and ""I want you pick me up"" (no hate, I love these songs). The contrast is pretty jarring.

I have a theory on this phenomenon - first of all, titles are obviously much shorter and thus easier to make grammatically correct. There's also a lot more riding on them, when a song title can literally make or break a track. Whereas a lot of the time, lyrics aren't paid much attention to and are sometimes even used just to fill in musical space (something Max Martin, one of the most prolific songwriters in pop music, employs this tactic shamelessly). 

My question is, who's actually titling these songs? Whose niche job is it to sift through the Korean lyrics and come up with an English song title? Moreover, who has the language skills in *both* languages to come up with something sharp and idiomatic?

Some more examples of song titles that have impressed me with their idiomatic English :

- Dally
- My First and Last
- Mach
- Save Me, Save You
- Oh! My Mistake
- basically all of Gfriend's English song titles (seriously, Rough?? who came up with that?)
- Playing With Fire
- Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears
- The Truth Untold

As an addendum, it seems like SM's foreign songwriters are coming through with the English lyrics that mean that their newer songs have a lot more lyrical consistency: 

- Tempo (ugh, what a pretty word and so much nuance)
- Simon Says
- Cherry Bomb
- Wakey-Wakey
- basically all of Red Velvet's English song titles (Cookie Jar, Rookie, Ice Cream Cake, Be Natural, Sappy, Dumb Dumb, Peek-A-Boo, ugh so on brand and so good)

What are some other English features in kpop that just get you brimming with satisfaction at the deft use of language? I'm definitely overthinking this, but hey that's what fandom is for right?",42,47

I'm looking for K-pop songs in that have an equivalent (cover, original version, alternate version, whatever) in another language, and where the two language versions have a similar sounding lyric but actually different meanings in each respective language.

I looked up if there was a well-known term for this and got https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soramimi, so maybe that's what you can call it.

Here are some examples.

[TDC's remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxr9tvYUHcg) of [Yoko Oginome's Dancing Hero (Eat You Up)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMpv4T1r92g) -&gt; [Celeb Five's I wanna be a celeb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsqG9k6LOE0).

I love the goofy versions when gg and bg exchange songs but sometimes I come across stuff that is just insanely beautiful and give a completely different vibe from the original. I'd love to find more of these. Do you guys have any suggestions?  


Here are mine:  
[Giantpink - Dumb Dumb Dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPONcsFfUzw)  
[SNSD - Sorry Sorry](https://youtu.be/acvPgEbXtD8)  
[Lovelyz - Bonamana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbecg9UHYIc)  
[BTS - Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiN5hPrZgw8)  but I think more people know the cover haha, so I leave the original too: [Urban Zakapa - Cafe Latte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5SE5Ds8d9w)  
I recently learned that [Red Velvet - Rebirth](https://youtu.be/bLtRsfnTnlU) is also a cover, of [Yoon Jong Shin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5lqm-39_JM)  


Another thing is when the original artist twist their own song:  
[Taeyeon - Devil's Cry (Run Devil Run intro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbHbt1egxXQ)  
[Suju - Don't Don (hard rock break)](https://youtu.be/wliyKLNgVOU?t=171)

I feel all their songs follow the same formula and its gotten so repetitive to me. Anyone else feel the same?

Fire Truck skirts, kilts, shiny leather pants, and straps should be burnt and never brought back, but Limitless hair was...something else, to put it kindly. In no universe would Jaehyun ever be considered an unattractive man, but while that blonde bowl cut didn't make him look *ugly*, per se, it definitely wasn't pretty. Let's not even get into WinWin and Mark's hair.

Besides Wolf, I think EXO have actually been fairly lucky with their styling. There've been a few weird outfits over the years, but their clothes usually at least fit the concept. I don't really like the whole Kokobop aesthetic, but the one that really gets me is in Love Me Right when they wear football jerseys and Yankees baseball caps. I couldn't stop laughing the first time I saw them like that because of all sports their stylists just had to choose to mix those two. But like I said, compared to some of their label mates (cough cough NCT and Red Velvet) EXO have consistently good outfits.",170,64

[a video clip of the first shooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YIpxhPhln0)

Yeeun, Nam Taehyun and 2 Thai actors, James Theeradon and Kitty Chicha will become food truck merchants in a Thai variety show to promote Thai tourism, Food Truck Battle. The show Is hosted by Ten Chitapol and Chef Gunn Sorawit. The first episode has filmed some days earlier at Asiatique, Bangkok. They will move to another city of Thailand, Chanthaburi, for the next shooting.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, Yeeun was teamed up with James and Taehyun with Kitty. With the help from the pro, the 2 teams will create new menus, which they will cook and sell on the food truck. The menu also will be available at 7-11 for a limited period of time and the sale via 7-11 will be combined with the sale from the food truck to decide the winner.  James said he cooked for the first time in the show.

&amp;#x200B;

The show will aired on every Tuesday and Wednesday on PPTV, premiere on July 16. The episode will be available on Youtube a week after the TV broadcast.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if it will be a change of cast as it is not specified.",7,84
