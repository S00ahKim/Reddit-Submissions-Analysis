21,2014-5-2,2014,5,2,9,24i2tt,"Hey guys, I'm writing a blog focusing on high quality editorials, reviews and guides to non-idol Korean music and I'd love your input!",BoraFan,1398990204,"Link to the site: http://koreanmusicreview.blogspot.co.uk

Whilst there is a lot of good quality, analytical content posted here and elsewhere focusing on top tier idol industry music, I really felt that we could use more expansive content concerning Korean music at large. So about a week ago I set about designing and writing my own blog, aiming to provide just that! I wanted to put up a fair amount of content before posting here so you could get a feel for the site before I went any further. Content is [currently] split into several sections:

---

* **Artist Spotlights:** These articles aim to introduce you to artists you may not have heard of - or if you have - serve as a highlight reel of some of their best work. I currently have a Younha spotlight up as an example ([link for the lazy](http://koreanmusicreview.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/artist-spotlight-younha.html)). The bulk of the articles will focus on the interesting parts of the artists history and a kind of overview/review of their releases past and present.

* **Beginner Guides:** Hopefully these will span a variety of genres and topics, aiming to provide an entry point into genres of Korean music you might not have any experience with at all. Currently I'm in the middle of writing a somewhat extensive guide to Korean hip hop which will hopefully prove useful to anyone interested in learning more about the industry. [Here's Part 1](http://koreanmusicreview.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/a-beginners-guide-to-korean-hip-hop-pt1.html) for the curious!

* **Eyes On:** This is the primary section I would love your input on. I'm planning for this to be a series of articles focusing on up-to-date key issues within Korean music in general. As I feel there can never really be enough high quality editorial pieces for K-Pop, I'd love to write about any topics you'd find interesting (idol-related or not). What kind of material would you like to see explained and discussed here, basically? Sajaegi, representation of race/gender in the industry, or something else entirely?

* **News:** Title is probably a little bit misleading. I'm not planning to do any kind of exhaustive news or anything - I don't think I'm capable of [nor do I see a need to] step on the toes of big sites like allkpop, soompi etc. which people will go to for news on their favourite artists anyway. Really this section is hopefully useful as a way for me to highlight new releases that I find particularly interesting or feel could use attention.

* **Reviews:** I'm aiming to do in-depth album reviews covering a wide range of Korean music - currently I have a review for AKMU's *Play* and the KOXX's debut album *Access OK* available for you guys to check out. [Here](http://koreanmusicreview.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/review-akdong-musician-play_26.html) and [here](http://koreanmusicreview.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/review-koxx-access-ok.html) respectively. If you have an album you'd particularly like for me to take a look at, I'm completely open to suggestions.

---

So that's it, basically! If you have any ideas or critique to send my way (as mentioned before, I'd love some ideas for editorials you guys would be interested in seeing) I'd gladly accept it. If you find anything factually awry or generally off in anything I've put up so far let me know; the strength of this blog format is that I can easily change things and shift stuff about. My core philosophy with this is to put out articles and opinion pieces to a consistently high standard, so you'd be helping a lot by pointing out any potential issues along the way.

Thanks, and hope you guys find the blog useful!

Is it because they are this good, is it because '200%' is awesome, or is it because the entertainment industry has been silent these weeks. There haven't been any real new releases, promotions or music shows so there also isn't any competition, right? And when there is no competition it is easy to stay first place. (this sounds a bit harsh, sorry, I don't know how to say it in other words) Or is it because of both, Akdong Musician is a good artist and because there isn't that much competition?

If I offended anyone by this, I am truly sorry, it was not my intention.  I just wondered what you guys think about this. ",2,0

That being said, I fear I'm not the only one. 
My advice is to continue emailing them or send  /u/flowsion a message!
**I should also note, they are sending me the T Shirt for free!**


I would delete this thread, but I feel like it might help others that had the same issue and I would like to update those that saw it earlier and are seeing it again.

-----------------------


I'm submitting this because I just got off the phone for the 3rd time with PayPal and I really don't want people to encounter these issues in the future.

Before the KBS concert I ordered from Koreaboo a KPOP DREAMS hotel package along with a T shirt. The total charge was $120, as I ordered 2 nights. 

The KPOP DREAMS hotel was awesome and the overall experience was something I would recommend to anyone! It was the funnest time I've had in my life, period. 

However I had ordered a T shirt from the website for $20. At first I thought it was going to be shipped to me, so I waited for a shipping confirmation. When I got no shipping confirmation I emailed them and they replied saying that it was supposed to be picked up at the festival. Sounds good. So when I get to the festival I look for the Koreaboo venue, I must have asked 10 staff if they knew where it was and everyone told me they have never heard of them. I wasted a good hour looking for that stupid venue/booth/whatever it was. I then went to the concert as usual and went home.

When I got home I found out it was only being given to people that got there at specific times in the morning! Why didn't they tell me this? So I emailed them and explained my situation and they said they were issuing refunds to everyone that didn't pick up their merchandise, I should receive a refund that night and an email. 


I waited, and waited. 

9 days later no email or refund.


I emailed them again and told them about this. I haven't received a reply, that was on April 23rd. 9 days go.

So on April 24th I called PayPal and disputed the transaction and had to send a letter, now I called them again because PayPal still hasn't replied and supposedly I will get an update on May 7th.

81,2014-5-5,2014,5,5,9,24qhig,Linguistics Project: K-pop vs American pop,smilezsosik,1399250167,"Hi! I am a student that is an avid fan of K-pop. For my final project in linguistics, I have decided to demonstrate how culture can be shaped by language and vice versa through the medium of music. I need some sources about Korean culture that can help support my analysis. Ex. Seasons have much more significance in subject matter in Korea than in the U.S. 

They do not have to be formal sources such as scholarly journal and the like since there don't appear any at all. (I know I should be conducting research alone, but it doesn't hurt for some insight.)
Note: I felt it it was appropriate to ask here since the subject matter is k-pop


**Main ideas:**

* Language influences culture and vice versa (concept I learned in class).

* Translation is difficult due to cultural differences (example).

* Music is used as the medium that reflects language and culture in this analysis.



**Guidelines:**

**Your data:**

You should obtain original data relevant to your topic. For example, you could ask people to perform a communication task and record their behavior. Or you could interview people about their beliefs and record or summarize the interview. Or you could use data selected from any form of the medianewspapers, brochures, websites, etc. You do not need to obtain a large amount of databut it is valuable to have more than two sourcese.g., 3 or more interviews, 3 or more examples from the media, etc. whenever possible.

**Your analyses:**

Your analyses should focus on issues in language and communication. They should demonstrate that you have understood the material in our course and that you can apply concepts to new examples. They should also demonstrate your ability to look at the data from more than one perspective.
Your analyses can be modeled on examples in your readings or our class discussions. I do not expect formal statistical analyses but rather a basic description and comparison of relevant information.

**Your paper:**

**Your paper should include the following sections:**

1. Title Page with Title of Paper and Your Name

2. Statement of Topic

3. Background (including relevant material from this class)

4. Methodology and Data

5. Analysis and Limitations of Study

6. Conclusions and Further Issues to Explore (should include discussion of at least two
disciplines, in terms of how they would approach the topic)

7. References used (including references assigned in class and class notes; references to
class notes can be informal)

8. Appendix: Include a copy of all the materials used and data obtained

The expected length for the paper is 5-7 pages, not including the title and references.

My original plan was to have a few discussions a day, 1 of which is a highly popular song, maybe during midday, then two others in the morning and at night which are on the less popular side. For now, I have been using 3 popular songs in order to get the thread going.

Is this frequency too excessive? Or should something be changed in that, or maybe in the format itself? I appreciate any feedback and I will change it accordingly. Thank you all for participating with these song discussions.",14,0

145,2014-5-7,2014,5,7,17,24xro4,Can the Kpop fandom please stop with the Konglish? (Warning: rant inside),[deleted],1399451657,"I've been in the fandom for going on 10 years now and I've noticed an increase in adoption of Konglish by fans, some of whom aren't even aware that their English is wrong. Anyone else noticed this?

The worst example is probably ""title track"" or ""title song"" which is a misused loanword in Korean. A title track would be a song that shares the same name as the album or EP that it's from, or a movie that it's featured in. Koreans use the word to mean ""lead single,"" which is a different concept altogether. MAMA was a title track (from the MAMA EP) while Fire (from the 2NE1 EP) was not.

Another is the use of ""schedule,"" which is used in Korean to mean an appointment, prior engagement, event, etc. In actual English it means a plan of events. Saying ""Celebrity A had a schedule on the 5th"" is not at all correct.

I know this looks like a pet peeve but I wondered if any other English speakers were annoyed by it.",8,0

I am a pretty casual K-Pop listener. I am not a super mega fan, I just listen to what interests me. Now, when I heard about G-Dragon I was still pretty new to K-Pop but I loved his ""One of a Kind"" EP he released back in 2012. It sounded exciting and fun and I loved every track on it.

When I heard about his new album ""Coup D'etat"" through his Complex interview I was excited but felt it was a little bit weird that he was going to release an album just a couple months after his last effort but, I remained hopeful. Then when I listened to the album I felt nothing but disappointment. Out of the 12 songs I only felt good about 4-5 tracks and reading his Pitchfork review I felt like others felt the same way. 

So, instead of completely shunning away his new material I included it with his ""One of a Kind"" EP and felt that it was more of a solid album. I only recently found this community on Reddit and felt as a way to properly indoctrinate me to the K-Pop fandom that I share this with you. I hope you enjoy.

All I'm asking for is shipping (probably somewhere from$3-$6 in the US), otherwise the album is free. I'll leave submissions open for two days. All you have to do is comment here, and at 3:00 PM CST on Sunday, I'll choose someone at random via dice roll.

Good luck, everyone!

Edit: As I've gotten a few questions on shipping to places other than the U.S., I wanted to clarify: I will ship anywhwere as long as you don't mind paying the shipping costs. For whomever wins, I will mail it out and then send a picture of the reciept to confirm the actual shipping amount. Method of payment is up to the recipient, but Paypal is probably easiest.

Edit II: The die has been cast! I rolled a 100-sided die for 84 submissions, and the first roll, 97, resulted in a re-roll. Second roll came out a 34, which makes our winner /u/ShatteringBlue! Congratulations, and thanks to everyone who participated!",80,21

234,2014-5-10,2014,5,10,17,2572p7,EXO should be the next break through artist in the united states,[deleted],1399711273,"Really, they should. The only barrier is that initial exposure. I feel as if for asian artists the main hurdle is getting past that dismissal and prejudice against asian males. Also, it's a lot worse for twenty something's and up. The younger generation grew up with the internet since 5+ and inevitably have less prejudice than many of their older counterparts.

I watch overdose and growl, and see absolutely no reason One Direction  or Bieber would do well here and EXO wouldn't. . . Other than two factors: 1) they are not prejudiced in the US as they are white males; 2) they have mega companies that could make anyone popular enough with marketing.  Literally, even with the prejudice against asian males in the US, there is literally very little criticism one could give to EXO when watching Growl, and for me, even overdose. It's amazing, because I feel like even someone whose been told their whole lives by Hollywood that attractive asian males and amazing acts don't go together, WOULDNT be able to deny the swag of these 12 individuals. 

99% of mainstream artists these days don't write their own songs. The exception with EXO is that despite this they hone their craft to the dot (dancing, singing, stage charisma and performance) that mainstream singers in other regions don't even come close to. The other part is great production values from SME.

So, what will it take to finally tip Exo into a status that they deserve, and FYI, I am not a long time exo fan, so this post is as objective as I can possibly be.",0,1

There is one boy group that I enjoy a lot, but everytime they come on, I'll be doing work around the house and am never able to catch the name of the group or song.

It's a rather short song, very bass heavy. On the Mnet live performance all of them are wearing red shorts and shirts. After a while a team of police officers come in and they all get shot down. A few seconds later they all seem to get revived and continue on with their performance. During the second half of the performance, the music reminds me a little of Kanye West - Black Skinhead with the heavy drums and even singing style.

I hope I described it well enough and someone can help me out, it's been driving me nuts.",2,2

Apparently this could be real, then? SM Entertainment has not said anything official yet, but if you look at the invoices and images of Kris's complaint in The National Court (allegedly public records? Don't quote me on this!), you can see there is a complaint.

I think the word ""allegedly"" is key here since this is a firestorm.

Shit really is hitting the fan hard...and with other SM artists getting stock options from SM due to their contract, everybody in SM is losing money. Kris is in for a lot of hate from his own labelmates

###Overall Summary

EXO-M's Kris filed a lawsuit on May 15, 2014 against his company, SM Entertainment, through Seoul Central District Court. Being the leader of a popular idol group, this has become very complicated. Reasons for the lawsuit are unconfirmed at the moment. Members of EXO (especially Tao, Sehun, Suho, Chanyeol) have reacted strongly. Kris is working with the same law firm that Hangeng used when he broke off his contract with SM in 2009. They have expressed their desire to finish everything as quietly as possible. EXO's first solo concert takes place from May 23-25. SM has stated that they will continue with the concert without Kris, although they would prefer him to cooperate. As of the 15th Kris is in Beijing, he cancelled his flight back to South Korea.

###Who is Kris?

Kris is the Chinese leader of EXO-M, subgroup of EXO, one of SM Entertainment's popular boybands. They are known for their slogan 'We are One', and for their large amount of numbers (12 in total). They debuted in April 2012. Kris was born in China, grew up in Canada and moved to Korea to pursue his idol career.

###The facts
* Kris filed a lawsuit for contract termination on May 15, 2014 at Seoul Central District Court. [\[source\]](http://www.soompi.com/2014/05/14/chinese-media-reports-that-exos-kris-asked-for-contract-termination/)[\[source\]](http://fy-exo.com/post/85839609067)
* In an interview following the event with Suho, leader of EXO-K [\[source\]](http://blog.koreaboo.com/post/85812632743/exos-suho-speaks-up-about-kris-actions-of-filing-a) : 

&gt;Suho seemed particularly disappointed, in which he described Kriss actions as irresponsible and that nothing was wrong between EXO and their agency. He also expressed that he believed Kris should cancel the lawsuit and apologize to the agency and members immediately. [...] Suho commented, Our slogan is We are one, and so we will strive to be unselfish, and always put our fans first. 

* Sehun posted [this photo](http://instagram.com/p/oAjwLZrkH6/) on instagram.
* Chanyeol posted [this photo](http://instagram.com/p/oAyikZrmei/) on instagram, the description translates to ""reward virtue/good and punish the bad/evil"". The first half is written in Korean, the second half is written in Chinese.
* Tao has posted the following on instagram [\[source\]](http://instagram.com/p/oBGwcthPTt/)[\[trans source\]](http://fy-exo.com/post/85815560107) : 

&gt; ""The road is long, and no one can decide where you want to go. The public will always be left in the dark, but it might be that the public will side with who is in the minority. However that's not the truth. Only those who have experienced the truth are able to understand, such as our 11 members and SM employees. To those on the outside, the right and wrong could be reflected oppositely. They probably won't know what it feels like to be betrayed by another person and then to have everyone side with the person who has betrayed us. Everyone can have their own perspectives and opinions. However, the truth is pointing to what is right and wrong. We have a clear conscience. We can't stop someone who wants to leave, and he kept this from us. As we were sweating and practicing hard for our concert, we learned that one wouldn't be coming back. We have to restart preparations for the concert as 11 members. So tired. EXO, let's love.""

###The Rumors 

* SM employees are confiscating phones of the members and have been posting messages on sns on their behalf.
* The location attached to the weibo posts that Tao made are nowhere near Seoul, which is where EXO lives/practices. [\[source\]](https://twitter.com/NheSica/status/466940221095817217) 
* SM is using the two maknaes (Tao, Sehun) and making them release their frustration so that the argument is more credible. If the youngest are angry and the leaders are angry then it is more real. 
* Details about the lawsuit [\[trans source\]](https://twitter.com/mystifize) :

&gt;""Kris' lawsuit states that SM did not treat him like an artist but as an object"" [\[...cont\]](http://pastebin.com/yzApHZcm) 

* The reasons as to why Kris wants to leave are [\[source\]](https://twitter.com/nuguyixing/status/467118778803691520)[\[source\]](http://twishort.com/XGtfc) [\[source\]](https://twitter.com/nuguyixing/status/467121049805410306):

1) SM restricted Kris's personal interest in acting despite attempts to negotiate 

2) Unfair earning distributions 

3) Health issues, SM refused his requests for medical treatment

* Kris is backed by a Chinese media agency. [\[source\]](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s1pa3b)

###The Disproved Rumors

* BoA, Eunhyuk, Onew, Ryeowook, Seohyun did NOT unfollow SMTOWNGLOBAL on twitter due to Kris. They never followed or unfollowed a while ago. 
* Tao owns both Android and iOS phones, explaining the weibo posts.
* Weibo's headers change automatically, Luhan's header being a picture of a galaxy is merely a coincidence.
* Tao never posted ""I love you Wufan!"" on Weibo. 
* The circulating angry Tao phone recording is very old, unrelated to the current situation.

447,2014-5-17,2014,5,17,1,25q2vi,[Discussion] KPOP and SOs,mfigzz,1400259089,"I've been pondering this for a while, but I was wondering what role kpop plays in your relationship with a SO.


**For those with a SO:**

* What is your/your SO's opinion of kpop? Does your/your SO's taste in music affect each others?
* What is your opinion of your SO having a bias?
* At what point do you think your SO's affection for their bias negatively impacts your relationship?
* Do you think your/your SO's financial investment in kpop can affect your relationship?
* Would jealousy in your relationship ever be a concern with regards to kpop?


**For those without a SO:**

* Are you interested in a partner who shares an interest in kpop?
* Do you think your infatuation with your bias interferes with future relationship opportunities?
* Or are you perfectly content with supporting your bias without pursuing romantic relationships with others?

I have a friend whose SO is interested in about 3 bands that she follows. She's very involved in the kpop community and has many biases, and her SO is supportive of her interests. I have another friend who has one ""ultimate bias"" and has told me that she is uninterested in a relationship for the time being. As for myself, I'm single and indifferent towards romantic relationships, reasons being unrelated to kpop.

I know it's common for people to have posters of singers/actors on their walls and have a celebrity crush, but I feel like there's more intimacy (or illusion of intimacy) when it comes to kpop.

I tried to state these questions in a general, non-judgmental tone. I am not critiquing anyone's lifestyle; I'm just curious about everyone's opinions. Now that I've put my thoughts into words, I feel like this is a really stupid topic for discussion but I'm just gonna post it anyway...

According to Chinese media outlet [QQ (Tencent)](http://ent.qq.com/a/20140517/014787.htm) and also picked up by Korean media outlets, EXO-M confirmed the earlier reports that they did not expect Kris's lawsuit as they shared their thoughts:

Lay: ""Our EXO members are carrying out our activities and have no issues with our agency.""

Chen: ""All of the members are having a difficult time and were hurt by this. It is sad that this happened right before our concert which we've been dreaming about for a long time.""

Tao: ""Pulling this kind of action without consulting any of us as we await our world tour which is important to all of us is unacceptable and it is a bad act of betrayal.""

Xiumin: ""It's very bewildering that such a thing has happened. But even during a time like this, our 11 members will unite and put our all into preparing for our concert to keep our promise with fans. We are One!""

Luhan: ""Our 11 members all think the same way and will focus on preparing for our concert. We hope that there will be no more malicious public sentiment.""

With Kris' status as a member of EXO currently uncertain, the other 11 members will have to make up for the missing spot in the midst of all of this turmoil while preparing for their upcoming first solo concert as scheduled at Olympic Gymnasium, Seoul on May 23-25.

The members have already chosen a lawyer to represent them, even though it cost them a lot of money.

&gt; The biggest friction between the two is the problem of money balance. Even though the group has had multiple Korean and overseas concerts, they have not been paid properly. However, on the label's side, they are at a loss of what to do because even though they have invested a lot, there is not much profit. 

&gt; There is a difference in every contract, but in the case of idol groups, many labels take the profit and then distribute it later. In this case, the label has put forth that because of the high costs of promotions, there was no profit.

&gt; There are just a few groups who fit the description relatively ""new"" and has had concerts both in and out of Korea - who do you think it could be?

568,2014-5-21,2014,5,21,14,263ifu,DSP Media loses lawsuit filed by KARA's previous endorsed clothing company,picflute,1400649987,"DSP Media lost the lawsuit against them by KARA's previous endorsed clothing company 'ASK' and its parent company Real Company, which previously sought compensation for damages following negative press surrounding KARA's lawsuit against DSP Media in 2011.


To recap the situation a few years back, the clothing company claimed that because of the controversy surrounding KARA at the time, it had suffered losses. In addition, although KARA was scheduled to have several rounds of photoshoots with the clothing company, they were only able to partially carry out their activities before three of the members filed against DSP Media.

The Seoul High Court sided in favor of Real Company, ruling today (May 21, 2014), ""DSP Media should pay Real Company 50 million KRW (~48,700 USD).""

The court stated, ""Prior to KARA's dispute, they possessed a bright and friendly image and following the controversy and the negative press, their image substantially dropped... The dispute between KARA and their agency's over their contract was a breach of the endorsement contract for violation of the maintenance of their integrity as a default on one's obligation.""

However, the court rejected the claims by the clothing company that said their company's image as a whole also deteriorated.

Regarding the ruling, DSP Media rep revealed that they are reviewing the decision and are looking into the next steps to take.

In 2013, the VIP1 tickets [were $300 and you got pretty good seats](http://visual.ly/kcon-2013-ticket-information). However, I heard the actual con was disorganised and the events you get (signing, hi-touch, etc.) are randomly allocated so you might not get the band you want to see. I'm aware that you can swap vouchers though, so it may be possible to see what I want.


Anyone else been to KCON before? Can you share your experiences?

**UPDATE 2: [Raina's fansite](http://890507.com/) is on hiatus following this incident. 
Keun might be in trouble too for being involved in this incident (she re-tweeted Raina's tweets) Her [fansite](http://www.940820.com/) has been taken down.**
  ^Credit: ^/u/dreammeower

&gt; **Fan account:** Pledis apparently called a fanclub night before and asked if they could make a banner. fan club did a quick turn, made one late night and picked it up in the morning on the way to the event. throughout the 12 hour event, no members come near the AS/OC section nor greet them. Apparently all the other groups do. Fans wait wondering if they'll see them after the event. AS/OC leaves. No one tells the fans. Some fans miss the last train. (Some say that Hello Venus apologized to AS fans but not sure that's true.)

832,2014-5-29,2014,5,29,12,26r888,Why do k-pop fans take netizen comments so seriously?,ellemae93,1401332967,"I realize that Korea is a very wired country and that netizen opinion is particularly important in a celebrity culture like Korea's. But people are failing to understand that the same 15 people do not comment on every netizen article and that random comments on the internet don't really represent the beliefs and opinions of every Korean person. People are generalizing the ""k-netz"" as a whole and villianizing them as if international netizen are any better, or any different. To be honest, the average Korean probably doesn't even care or know about every little in and out of celebrity/idol culture unless they follow it. I have a Korean friend who is a casual SHINee fan, and when I asked her what she thought of the Onew/Jungah scandal she told me she had never even heard about it and no one around her had, but that she was glad he had a girlfriend. 

Reading netizen comments is fun and everything because it provides a perspective non-Korean fans can't provide, but lately I feel like kpop fans are taking them waaaaay too seriously. Why do international fans feel like we have to live or die by what Koreans think of our favorite idols? ",4,3
