4,2014-9-1,2014,9,1,12,2f4xxj,What would happen if nudes of Kpop stars got leaked?,golazo32,1409540425,"By now, you may have heard that many A-list celebrities (most notably Jennifer Lawrence) have had nude selfies hacked from their iCloud accounts and posted all over the web.  Given that this isn't a taboo thing in America (who hasn't sent nude selfies), I'm willing to bet not only will these celebs recover from this, they are also probably seen in a more sympathetic light.  

However, what would happen if A-list Kpop celebs (SNSD, 2NE1, etc).  had their nudes hacked and posted everywhere?  Given the outcry of idols even dating, Kpop stars are probably a bit more careful about this sort of stuff.  Still, if it did happen, would they even be able to salvage their careers?  The only time this has happened was with Baek Ji Young's sex tape, but it took like 5 years for people to move on and she's not really an ""idol"" in the traditional sense.",32,17

10,2014-9-1,2014,9,1,12,2f51jo,What do you think is the perfect number of members for a k-pop group?,Parsleypants,1409543143,"I noticed this summer has really been the summer of the 4-girl group: Sistar, Secret, Girls' Day, BESTie, (the new) KARA, Red Velvet. It's got me thinking about what number is ideal as far as k-pop groups go.

When I think of Western pop, five seems to be an iconic number: Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Spice Girls, NKOTB, One Direction. After five members, it becomes harder to keep track of everyone and line distribution gets messy. Girls' Generation is an obvious exception though.

What are your thoughts?",35,6

**All news before 9:30AM KST on September 5, 2014 is in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2fay4e/megathread_ladies_code_car_accident/ck9gx9f). I've reached the character limit for this post, so I've archived all old info. This post will continue to hold the newest information.**

*****

## Summary of older news. Read the archive comment for detailed information.

A wheel of Ladies' Code's van fell off and they lost control and crashed. EunB passed away. RiSe is unconcious and in critical condition in the ICU. Sojung has regained conciousness and stablized. Ashley and Zuny only sustained minor injuries. EunB's wake is being held through September 5th.

## News  

# September 5

* **Update 10:01AM KST:** Sojung was examined this morning and will undergo facial surgery later today. She is NOT in critical condition anymore. ([Source](http://isplus.joins.com/article/339/15746339.html))

* **Update 5:00PM KST:** Zuny and Ashley were by EunBi's mother throughout the service and that they hugged her when she was crying. Confirms that Super Junior, Girls Day, Secret, Kara, actor Yang Dong Geun and composer were at the funeral. ([Source](http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/society/2014/09/05/0701000000AKR20140905045551005.HTML), thanks to /u/lovingu)

* **Update 10:00PM KST:** Sojung has successfully finished facial surgery, but she has still not been informed about EunB and Rise. Upon seeing family and staff members continually going around in mourning attire, she reportedly asked ""why does everyone keep wearing black?"". Nobody has yet informed her, and she has not asked again. (T/N: it seems that Sojung is conscious and communicating with those around her as well as picking up on her surroundings, which is good to hear.) ([Source](http://isplus.joins.com/article/959/15749959.html), translation via /u/evenastoppedclock)

# September 6

* **Update 12:04AM KST:** Polaris has released a new statement saying that Ashley and Zuny have returned to to the hospital for further treatment following EunB's funeral. ([Source](http://news.nate.com/view/20140905n28162))

  &gt;I met EunB, who has left to heaven, for the first time today through a picture. She was very cute, and seeing her smile kindly brought tears to my eyes. The person who is having the hardest time more than anyone, EunBs mother, said EunB [Your] seniors came to see you, EunB. and comforted us instead, and watching that made me feel very sad and many thoughts passed my mind. To be honest, I have been thinking a lot since yesterday whether I should post on SNS or not about this tragedy that doesnt feel like anyone elses business. What I want to say is, please make sure to wear seatbelts. We, more than anyone else, have personal ties with car accidents. 8 years ago, when I had a car accident, if I wasnt wearing a seatbelt Even I have times where it feels bothersome to wear a seatbelt but I think about the past and always wear one. I want to say this again, so I am leaving a post like this.. I sincerely hope EunB resst in peace and for those around EunBg to become happy. And I hope RiSe, who is still going undergoing treatment, to wake up soon. Our member Kyuhyun said when he was in an accident, he wasnt conscious for 4 days.. and that RiSe will definitely wake up.. Really.. Like Kyuhyuns words.. Like Kyuhyun.. I pray that she will have strength and wake up.

Shame idols on social media for not wearing seatbelt. See instagram selca in a car with no seatbelt on? - tell them to #BuckleUp in comments. Watch them ride in vans with no seatbelts on in reality/variety/drama shows? - hit personal/company/tvstation twitter with screencaps and #BuckleUp message. Maybe draw a red seatbelt in paint over screencaps and photos to make it loud and clear. Even if they don't care about their own safety they will care about their public image.

If Eunb hadn't been ejected from the car she might have lived. Even lap belts reduce the risk of being ejected from the car in a crash by a quarter.",39,113

279,2014-9-7,2014,9,7,7,2fo8mg,Anybody interested in starting a crowdfunding effort for Ladies' Code and Polaris Entertainment?,RidgeBoy,1410043167,"I was a huge American fan of Ladies' Code and was sad beyond belief to hear the about the car accident that affected the group. Ashley, Rise, Sojung, Zuny, and EunB all meant so much to me and it breaks my heart to see this misfortune affect them. While very little could possibly fix all the damage that's been done to Ladies' Code and their friends and family, I want to help in whatever way I can. At the same time, I want to show that the fans of the Western world are fully supportive of Ladies' Code and will be with them every step of the way.

As somebody who's actually been in several car accidents in the past and has also used crowdfunding to moderate success, crowdfunding, especially for those in dire need, is close to my heart. I have coordinated the actions of a charity in the past and adept at social media use (ex. Facebook, Twitter, etc.). With recent coverage of the culture of Korean idols and traffic playing a part in the accident as well as updates on the conditions of Sojung and Rise, I wanted to help coordinate crowdfunding effort to raise money for the following:

1) For the relatives of all the members of Ladies' Code affected by the accident, particularly EunB, Sojung, and Rise

2) To pay a chunk of the medical costs that are currently being spent for Sojun and Rise as they hopefully make their recovery

3) To support Polaris Entertainment, an entertainment company that was surely extremely dependent on Ladies' Code

4) And finally, lobbying efforts to improve the situation of Korean transportation and its lax traffic laws


I was thinking that we could start a crowdfunding campaign on a site like GoFundMe and Indiegogo (I'm leaning to these two sites over any other because they seem to be more oriented on community and emergency causes, rather than sites like Kickstarter that focus on private development). I think that on we on Reddit can do a lot for this movement including:

1) Spreading the general word about this tragedy to not only prevent something similar in the future, but also alleviate the suffering of those involved

2) Coordinate efforts as a team on a crowdfunding campaign

3) And most importantly, through these efforts, get in touch with Polaris Entertainment. I have attempted to communicate with them in the wake of the accident but it's naturally hard as an American resident and English speaker. Our cooperation with Polaris Entertainment is critical for our end goal and to ensure transparency in the process.


I hope we can unite as the Western world to truly show that we care about KPop beyond purchasing music: we sincerely love our artists and would sincerely do anything within our power to help them.",2,0

I had to do something for myself and for the others this week, so I just decided I would just re-watch all the interviews/shows Ladies' Code were in and try to find some new ones and compile the best moments in 2 videos, one focused on RiSe's and EunB's moments, the other on Sojung's, Zuny's and Ashley's moments. I really hope this 2 videos can give all Lovely's, other Ladies' Code fans and just anyone in general a bright happy smile and leave you with great memories of Ladies' Code, and specifically of RiSe and EunB, contrasting with all the tears and sadness this past few weeks probably brough you! I really hope you enjoy this videos featuring the Amazing Ladies' Code!

For my AS-Level in Media Studies coursework I'm making a music video, and we're allowed to use pre-made songs if we want, but edited to 2 minutes or so to cut down on the workload for us.

I was thinking of doing Spica's Tonight, but with the second verse and chorus cut out to make it more manageable. Unfortunately, I don't have the software, knowledge or skill to be able to do that myself, so I was wondering if any if you guys could possibly help me out? You could make it yourself, or direct me to a tutorial on how to do it maybe?

Like I said, I don't know if this is where I should put this, but I guess since it's related to kpop I thought I should try. If this breaks any rules please tell me and I'll remove it, or move it somewhere else.

Thanks guys!

Runner up is [Love Dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIg6HtzBcFo) by Big Bang.

[Girls Day Female President in 60fps streaming](https://ia801401.us.archive.org/19/items/GirlsDayFemalePresidentFullHDGomTV/Girl%27s%20Day%20-%20Female%20President%20%28Full-HD%20GomTV%29.mp4)

The site is called Archive.org [\(link here\)](https://archive.org/) and it's free to sign up and upload things [\(upload link here\)](https://archive.org/create/)

It has 60fps streaming capability and no file size limit, so every 60fps Kpop video you have can be uploaded. I searched around and found full movies, books, tv shows, etc. The site is supposed to be a record of everything on the web.

I also made a community-driven website so we can have all these 60fps Kpop MVs to watch streaming in one place. 

It's called KPOP60.com: http://kpop60.com (zoom out if it looks too zoomed in)

Right now it has around 30 MVs, live perfs, fancams, dance versions with lots of different groups. The reason I made it is so all the 60fps stuff can be organized in 1 place and you can easily find the artist you want. and of course, STREAMING.

There's also a page where you can post links to streaming MVs you want added. 
http://kpop60.com/submit

Or you can post the links in this thread and I'll update the website with them.

Two months ago, my mother said ""It's better than American pop including that 12 year old crack kid from Canada and corrupted Hanna Montana."" (She's referring to Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus.) Ten weeks ago (I think), I watched SISTAR guest on After School Club on the TV (via Xbox via YouTube app) and my dad asked me who are they and where are they from. I told them SISTAR and they're from Korea, she liked the show and suddenly sing ""Nobody"" by Wonder Girls. Although, he only sing ""Nobody, nobody but you."" and not the Korean lines.

However my life as a kpop fan is pretty much all by myself. None of my friends listen to it so that makes me not talk about it with them. sometimes I feel like I'm by myself with it. I live in New York and sometimes I feel like there's no one else who's into kpop when I know thats not true. I know there are forms that people talk about kpop stuff but I wish for something more than that. I would like to have a friend who I can go to meet ups and concerts with cause I personally don't go because I don't have anyone to go with. Basically with this discussion I wanted to know if their are others out there that feel this way and if anyone would like to start a meet up so others like me won't feel so alone :) ",2,1

I actually was thinking how this is a problem *before* I heard the news about Seungri. Right now, Seungri's crash and Ladies' Code are obviously at the top of our minds. But going back a bit further...

09/2014 - Seungri (Big Bang) in car accident

08/2014 - Ladies' Code in a marjor crash. EunB perishes in crash, RiSe passes from injuries

08/2014 - G Dragon (Big Bang) was in a minor car accident

06/2014 - Woohyun (Infinite) in minorcar accident

02/2014 - HwaYoung (T-ara) hospitalized after minor accident

10/2013 - Jinwoon (2AM) in car accident

04/2013 - Jonghyun (Shinee) in car accident, breaks nose

12/2012 - Secret in car crash. Hyosung seriously injured

10/2012 - Miss A in accident

09/2012 - 4Minute in car accident

08/2012 - SoYeon (T-ara) in serious accident, had to be hospitalized

07/2012 - Nichkhun in accident after driving under the influence

08/2011 - Sooyoung (SNSD) was injured in a car accident

05/2011 - Daesung in car/motorcycle accident

04/2011 - Kyuhyun in another car accident

01/2011 - Leeteuk &amp; Heechul (Super Junior) in minor car accident

10/2009 - Beast in minor car accident

01/2008 - Jaejoong &amp; Changmin (DBSK) in car accident, not injured

09/2007 - Wonder Girls in car accident. No girls hurt, other driver dies

04/2007 - Kyuhyun, Leeteuk, Shindong, Eunhyuk (Super Junior) in car accident. Kyuhyun in critical condition, in a coma for for days

01/2007 - Jaejoong &amp; Yoochun in an accident because of fans

08/2004 - WANTED and DBSK, Soh Jae Ho (23) of wanted is killed

This is a very small sampling of k-pop idol car accidents based off of some quick Google searches. I searched groups that came to mind as some of the top idols and almost all came back with articles about crashes. Obviously idols are on the road more than the average person, but I feel like I hear about K-pop accidents way more than any US celebrity accidents. What do you guys think is wrong? Idols &amp; their drivers being too exhausted? A problem with driving in Korea in general? Something else?",28,2

Description: ""I'm all calmed down from last week.. The fact that my BIAS group cameback helped me a lot in it. This chart is a bit late but anyways we count with 6 new entries (Not so many entries because of Chuseok)! Who will get number 1? It's probably quite obvious if you follow my channel but :| . Shout out to Ladies' Code with Kiss Kiss (it hurts to even write their name :( ) who got the most votes last week!""

 How to vote in a nutshell: -You have 10 points you can use to vote on songs from the chart towards the monthly chart, you don't need to use all the points. You can't give more than 3 points to a single song.

Thanks to all those who check my charts out and sorry to all those who are bothered by my weekly posts! Please leave a comment with your opinion if you feel like it :D",2,5

Here's a list of my favourites I've seen:

B.A.P: Warrior, No mercy, Power

Shinee: Lucifer, Sherlock

EXO: Growl, Overdose (currently my favourite of all)

Also despite not being dance focused, I really like Big Bang.

I also haven't listened to many girl groups, I think I've only seen SNSD Gee, so some good girl groups/songs would be cool.

Thanks!",38,17

Been playing this for the past couple weeks, highly addicting!

However, its a bunch of SMTown artists (old and new).   
EXO-K/M, Super Junior/-M, SHINee, TVXQ!, BoA, Girls' Generation (:D), f(x), Red Velvet, TTS, etc...  
Great replay value.  Obviously offers in-app purchases, but all songs are free, and gameplay is good too!

Game is only officially available in South Korea (Google Plan and iTunes).  
You'll have to change your locale for iTunes, or just d/l an .apk for Android.

This is one of the few places (in english) that is talking about it.  Hope you guys enjoy this post :)

789,2014-9-22,2014,9,22,2,2h1sbn,ZE:A's leader Lee Hoo announces big changes to Star Empire and their contract,[deleted],1411321292,"ZE:A's leader Lee Hoo (Junyoung) posted an explosive series of tweets earlier today detailing the abuses he and his group faced under the management of Star Empire, which ended with him going into discussions with the agency's president.

After several hours of anxious waiting on the part of his fans, Lee Hoo returned to post the results of his meeting.

""[I finished speaking with President Shin Joo Hak,"" he posted. ""It has been decided that Star Empire will be operated by me, by us, as a ZE:A company. I promised all of you that ZE:A's Day will be coming, I said I will either knock it down or absorb it ... now is the time for you to protect us.. But the truth is...](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513733854889115648)""

""[Lastly, President Shin Joo Hak who lost everything and was left with empty pockets... I still deplore and hate you but you were our President for 8 years. You were my responsibility and.. that responsibility.. I'll take the shaming from the public and the fans. Myself and President Shin Joo Hak will take the responsibility. The contract has been flipped, we now receive 7 to every 3 for the President.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513735640207200256)""

""[What I want to say is, with this incident, I know that many other agency presidents are having problems with contracts. I will close my mouth so please fix the problem and treat your artists better. I will make this last request politely. If they can hear my heart ..](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513736889853947904)""

""[We will start fresh from the very beginning.. put everything down and consider it my baby.. I humbly request that you do it one more time.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513737660020449282)""

""[And to everyone, the fans, the reporters, who helped us.. thank you. Thank you so much for revealing our truth. To everyone reading this... in the name of ZE:A, the singers, the actors, the dancers, the variety people, and in the name of our seniors, friends, juniors and all of the artists... putting ZE:A and my name, Lee Hoo, on the line, I wanted to tell you that we will live bravely.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513738492937916416)""

""[I'm not a coward... but I will be quiet for the time being. I will be watching.. To all of the agency presidents and management, take care of your issues, fix your mistakes, apologize and acknowledge them.. what I, what we want is to put down everything and get the hearts of your artists.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513739868456116224)""

""[If something like this happens again in the future, this entertainment industry that I know, that I see, that I feel... please keep in mind that I have a weapon that will flip the entire industry on its head. I'm sorry for causing trouble.. and thank you again. Because of you, we found again.. the words of hope, dreams, goals. Thank you and please take care of us.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513741501600235521)""

It looks like there are big changes on the horizon for K-Pop contracts, and especially Star Empire. 

**[UPDATE 1]** ""[And there are some people that are misunderstanding.. this is about ZE:A internally. It's not that the ones playing around are splitting the money.. when I got hurt, I didn't receive payment for two years.. zero won.. it's not an issue of division. I won't say any more and remain quiet. Thank you.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513744349603954691)""

**[UPDATE 2]** ""[Media makes you become a hot issue, and also makes you an idiot in a second. I didn't show you anything stimulating, so now there's shaming going on.. It's the same. People say, 'He's the same. In the end it's for money'. I won't pay attention to those kind of statements.. Even when I was young, I didn't get slapped by my father..](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513747979006906368)"". 

""[I was a student who started this because I liked music.. But now the level is that I'm going on, shuting up about getting slapped and keeping it inside.. Everyone, help me stay quiet.. I beg you.. I'm sorry. Now, I call a break to this war and I'll see you next time.. I thank you all sincerely again.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513748688649191424)""

**[UPDATE 3]** ""[Yes, that's right. I'll slam the nail into your hearts. Because I was a man, because I was a leader, as the representative of ZE:A, I got slapped by Star Empire's President Shin Joo Hak. It wasn't just once or twice. This kind of strong, stimulating things... I'm human, too, so if I just wanted money, I would have said this from the beginning. Sigh...........](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513753082417520640)""

""[Also... Don't curse out the members.. They aren't at fault, and they're good kids who do everything they're told to.. Curse me and curse President Shin Joo Hak. Think again about who did this for who and what.. Please.. If I was at fault, I'll receive the punishment.](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513754077344178176)""

""[Sorry. And thank you..](https://twitter.com/ZEA_leader/status/513755175228420096)""

Lee Hoo, the leader of ZE:A fought for his rights and was able of, in just 2 days, get more than 2x more revenue for ZE:A and better conditions for his group!) Anyways, music wise this week had some great comebacks! Some of them that I even might've underrated this week and should go up next one! We count with 9 new entries, one of them that even surprised myself xD, you'll see why soon! Congratulations to T-ara with Sugarfree for getting the most votes last week!

There seems to be many people who believe that I am only thinking about myself and suppressing my thoughts after receiving money. That is not true. I have witnessed the tears of CEO Shin Joohak yesterday. This all happened within a day? No. This is the result of oppression that has spanned over years. Am I avoiding anything? No.  This is merely a ceasefire.

Now, this is mostly funny because I realize I'm a (very) white female who looks absolutely nothing like T.O.P., but I've learned to enjoy making an ass of myself, so why not?

Anyway, for those who are curious this mostly involved half a metric f*ckton of concealer and some very heavy contouring, especially the nose area. Also involved a lot of eyebrow and dim lighting to achieve the desired effect. I wasn't planning on showing this to anyone, but looking at these a day later, I've decided it's too hilarious to not share with my fellow redditors.

Member L(Jessica) from a popular girl group has not been on friendly terms with her management, staff and fellow members (everything is strictly professional). Member L(Jessica) was told to go under the knife when she received a drama offer late last year. She was not keen on receiving the role and more so did not want to go through any plastic surgery procedure. She was also told that she was going to work on a musical project once she finishes filming all her parts. However, when she became adamant about the role and the surgical procedure her agency threatened her pull her off the musical project. So she went along with the agencys decision. She was miserable with the initial surgical result and to make matters worse Member K(Taeyeon) who was also a part of the musical project requested the agency to replace L(Jessica) from the project with M(Seohyun), because L(Jessica) was unprofessional and argumentative during rehearsals. The agency also decided that it would be more profitable if they released the project earlier then planned. To top that Member K(Taeyeon) felt that M(Seohyun) was more deserving and the agency agreed. L(Jessica) was told about this change while she was shooting for her show, and as a result she felt she was back-stabbed by everyone involved excluding member M(Seohyun). Collaborative project was an instant surprise hit and L(Jessica) was not happy.",13,0

Best read from the top down, new stuff in each section at the bottom of each divide...

###What we know:

* [Around 5am KST a post on Jessica's WeiBo account was posted explaining briefly her departure from SNSD](http://www.weibo.com/3547642417/Bpknsn8y8): 

&gt;I was excited about our upcoming fan events only to shockingly be informed by my company and 8 others that as of today, I'm no longer a member. I'm devastated - my priority and love is to serve as a member of GG, but for no justifiable reason, I am being forced out.

* At around 6:30am KST Jessica updated her WeiBo once again with another message to fans [source](http://static1.allkpop.com/upload/2014/09/content/Jessica_1412038094_20140930_jessica.jpg): 

&gt;You guys are very special people that I love dearly, therefore you deserve to hear the truth from me. I'm deeply saddened and hurt by those who I trusted and hope that you don't ever have to experience this kind of pain. 

* [Around 8am KST, 8 members were photographed at Incheon Airport leaving for Shenzhen, China. They have a fanmeet there in the early evening.](http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1109968411) 

* [SM stock has now dropped 3% on news of this](https://twitter.com/instiz/status/516746642897125377/photo/1) which probably will mean that SM will address this situation sooner rather than later. 

* [Tiffany at airport spoke apparently](http://www.tvreport.co.kr/?c=news&amp;m=newsview&amp;idx=575662). I saw someone say she said ""No comment"". 

* [AKP](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2hunad/statement_from_sm_on_jessica/ckw60xe) received a statement from SM which gives no new information 

&gt; ""We cannot disclose what is going on yet, but we are reaching out to the proper people to find out the truth of the matter.""

* Jessica was been located according to [Dispatch](http://blog.koreaboo.com/post/98774748313/breaking-dispatch-finds-girls-generation-jessica-in). She was in New York and landed with Tyler in Incheon around 4am September 29th KST (yesterday). **NOTE: There is a 23 hour gap between her arrival in Seoul and her WeiBo post, Korea is GMT +9)

* [Jessica Jung has left Girls' Generation and will continue as 8 while supporting her solo activities](http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=001&amp;oid=311&amp;aid=0000390308)

* [Jessica haults activities with SNSD. The group will continue as 8, SM will continue to manage Jessica](http://wstarnews.hankyung.com/apps/news?popup=0&amp;nid=01&amp;c1=01&amp;c2=01&amp;c3=00&amp;nkey=201409301343211&amp;mode=sub_view)

* [English translated statement from SM](http://www.soompi.com/2014/09/29/sm-releases-official-statement-regarding-jessica-girls-generation-to-continue-as-8/)

&gt;This spring, due to her personal situation, Jessica said she would stop group activities after one more album. Despite Jessicas sudden statement, Jessica and the Girls Generation members continued to work hard and carefully think over so that the team can continue to work in the best direction. However, recently with Jessica starting her fashion business while there was a lack of specific mediation regarding the interests and prioritization of Girls Generations activities, a situation has been reached where the team cannot be maintained, despite continued discussion. As such, we could only pull up the plan for Girls Generations activities as 8 members, and while we were discussing the timing of the announcement, Jessica wrote the message in her own perspective earlier today. We plan to continue to support and manage Jessicas individual activities and Girls Generations activities as 8 members.

&gt;Sigh, I guess we'll have to try this yet again: I have no plans of marriage anytime soon, whether it be this year...next year... If that wasn't clear enough, let me know. I'll just keep trying...[] [6:47am October 1st]

&gt;@Sy__Jessica Hey, hang in there~! The truth about what really happened will be known - we all got your back! [07:28am October 1st]

* Jessica Jung released a statement [From koreaboo](http://blog.koreaboo.com/post/98851137128/breaking-jessica-releases-first-official-statement):

&gt;Hello, This is Jessica.

&gt;I was given a notice of departure from Girls Generation by my agency on September 29, and I cannot hide my shocked and upset heart about this, so Im here to reveal my feelings.

&gt;I have always put Girls Generations activities before my business or personal life as a member of Girls Generation. However, despite my efforts for the team, I have been asked to leave the team by the agency.

&gt;While I was planning my business that Ive had a lot of interest in since before, I had sufficiently consulted SM as well as the members about my preparation many times and asked for their understanding.

&gt;Up until the beginning of August when I was launching BLANC, I had made agreements and received permission from SM, and congratulations from the members as well.

&gt;However, in early September, after only a month since the launching, the members suddenly changed their position and held a meeting, and told me to either quit my business or leave Girls Generation without any justifiable reason. 

&gt;I explained that I had already received permission from the agency, that I had never neglected Girls Generations activities, and that I could not suddenly halt my business due to my contract with my business partner after a month. 
Ultimately, I pleaded that it was unjust for me to have to make a choice. Becoming a Girls Generation member was the best thing in my life, and I had never thought about quitting.

&gt;Shocked about this, I had met with the agency CEO on September 16 to convey my position, and once again confirmed their permission for carrying out my business.

&gt;However, on September 29, I was given a one-sided notice asking me to leave Girls Generation. Due to this, I was also unable to attend the fan meeting in China on September 30, and I have also been excluded from following Girls Generation activities.

&gt;I have received great pain and cannot hide my sadness that I was asked by the agency and fellow members, whom Ive spent 15 years with putting in all my passion and effort, to leave Girls Generation just because of the reason that Im starting a business.

&gt;I also want to apologize for causing concern to all the fans. Please understand that this situation is not at all what I had wanted, and that Ive always treasured Girls Generation, and that I will continue to do so. Thank you for always supporting and loving me.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;Jessica

And I'm going to have to blame SMent for this decision, along with the rest of SNSD and their respective parents. I have just lost all my respect for Girls' Generation and SMent. This is an outrage. Things could have been worked out in a calm fashion, but no, everything had to be dramatized, and on top of that, SNSD's members and family along is SMent cannot seem to accept the fact that everyone has their own goals. And they should have worked out some sort of agreement, leaving Jessica in SNSD yet allowing her to slowly drift from it as her business becomes more successful, or fully started up. I completely disagree with the ill-mannered booting of Jessica out of the group the second she has intentions in pursuing other career paths. I find this completely disrespectful to all the fans out there, along with dishonoring themselves. They are acting like a group of little five year old imbeciles, who can't deal with a fact that someone doesn't like their toy, or the fact that sharing is a thing. People who forced Jessica to make this decision don't deserve anything, they don't even deserve to be able to call themselves human beings, let alone a company and eight girls who are some peoples idols. They should be ashamed of themselves for what they actions. Again, I repeat, I have lost any and all respect for SMent and SNSD: members, family, and friends. I really am truly disappointed in this decision, and I wish the best of luck to Jessica. #StayStrongJessica",5,0

Given the excellent videos for Nu Abo and Electric Shock, and given how well produced and compelling Red Light is, I think all of that material would have been really special.  
Maybe it's just that my own knowledge of kpop isn't nearly as broad as many of the fans around here, but in my opinion Red Light was unique and very ambitious. It seemed like a real maturing of F(x) as a group - and I love their previous stuff anyway.
