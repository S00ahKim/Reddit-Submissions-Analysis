The FB page sidebar has the following:

JISOO/ (VOCAL) 


JENNIE/ (RAP, VOCAL) 



ROS/ (VOCAL) 



LISA/ (RAP, DANCE)




-----------------------------------------------------------------------



So we already knew Rose would be a vocalist, Jennie would be a rapper and vocalist, and Lisa would be a dancer, but now we know that Jisoo is a vocalist and Lisa is a rapper.


There's not much to go off of since we've never heard Jisoo/Lisa, but what to you guys think of the role distribution?


Also, it doesn't seem that a leader is designated. I wonder if that announcement will come later, or will we have a leaderless group (like MissA)?",2,8
