[BLACKPINK - BEHIND THE SCENES #001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bOfCLnOQnI)


I'm still sad and mad about that BLACKPINK TV only have 1 episode. I feel like during these times when they have no promotions, BP TV would be perfect for us blinks to keep up with the girls. 
We had BIGBANG TV, 2NE1 TV and WINNER TV and they got closer with their fans through it. 
Just look at how BTS and Big Hit Ent. does it, they have their own BANGTANTV YouTube channel and a new episode of ""Run BTS!"" every week. With all that it builds a connection between the fans and BTS. I wish we had something like that so we could get closer to BP. This is my opinion.


A lot of groups are having travel shows these days. I really want Blackpink to have one as well.
Lisa really wants to bring the girls to Thailand, so let them travel instead of letting them do nothing in their dorm and watch spongebob. *if someone from yg is reading this, take note.*

And we also know they have been working on new songs since months and that they mentioned SQ3 before AIIYL dropped. 

BUT, it sounds weird to me, if SQ3 would be their next comeback (which is very likely), that they've been working on only 2-3 songs since months. I mean, at the end of SQ2's promotion, YG said they recorded new music right after and in August, BP said they've been working on an album (even if an album in Korea can be literally everything). Plus, the Square songs are ready but we don't know if they will release them someday (which might be the reason why they recorded new stuff this year).

Anyway, my question is if they've been sitting on several songs during the entire year, does it mean we could possibly get a mini-album (at least) next year? (meaning no comeback during the 2 months left though).",2,15

The scene plays out almost exactly like was said in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/7b62ct/as_if_its_your_last_mv_and_song_to_feature_for/) - when Bruce Wayne goes to recruit Barry Allen, it starts playing in the background. No one in the scene acknowledges it (or a scene from Rick and Morty, which is on another screen in the same scene), but the music is going for about a minute, while the video is only visible for maybe 10 seconds, if that. 

My girlfriend and I lost it when the video came on - yes, I saw the screenshot from that trailer, but still had some skepticism about it being in the American version of the movie.

EDIT: Cannot believe I misspelled the name of the song in my post title. Really should have caught that, for as unreasonably long as I spent on this post. Um... I guess if a mod can fix it for me, I'll be very grateful? ",9,42

While ikon could use a few lessons in humility, Winner has made the best of a member loss and drought-like hiatus. But let's be blunt here: The remaining BB members are enlisting in the next year, Blackpink will be YG's most popular group by a long shot, and frequent promotions are critical for today's up and coming groups.

Blackpink is the first group I've followed since day one. Consider me paranoid, but I am somewhat terrified of the possibility of our girls suffering what Winner suffered. I see TWICE and Red Velvet having three comebacks with great songs in one calendar year, and I'm just shaking my head at what may happen to Blackpink.

Daesung had his Japan tour, GD and Taeyang held their own solo world tours, and the four active members are holding a huge 2 day concert at the end of the year.

All of Bigbang's activities have no doubt taken serious time and resources, so is that a possible reason as to why Blackpink had such limited promotions this year? Or is it another case of YG 's dungeon in full force?

Hearing Jennie talk about Netflix was just so disheartening. It's so obvious the girls want to release new songs and MVs at a more frequent pace. I get that Bigbang is YG's financial breadwinner, but they all have to enlist in the next year or two. I really hope YG realizes how big Blackpink can really get with proper comebacks.",5,20

143,2017-11-25,2017,11,25,2,7f8vg9,BLACKPINK'S DIGITAL PERFORMANCE: AN ANALYSIS,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/7f8vg9/blackpinks_digital_performance_an_analysis/,gills__,1511544132,"These days, I've been seeing a lot of people downplaying BLACKPINK - especially their domestic performance - going as far as to say YG needs to give them content soon to keep them alive, they're not being able to get to the top because YG doesn't give them an album etc. - it was very weird to see all this as someone that observed the digital charts year long. If someone doesn't include BP in their top 3 kpop ggs...their delusion is hella strong - and that seems to be the case on r/kpop and sites likes NB, AJ, Pannchoa etc. And its frustrating. But more frustrating is BLINKS doing the same.

Therefore, here's a breakdown of BLACKPINK's actual performance - against releases by their competitors Red Velvet and TWICE and an analysis of BLACKPINK's performance.

**Streams:**

[Visualisation](https://imgur.com/0vMYDSH)

**Observations:**

**PWF:**

-Started out with really less numbers of streams per week. Consistently below TT for a very, very long time.

-However, at week 39, PWF overtook TT in number of streams per week. PWF consistently started getting higher streams than TT per week.

-Eventually, PWF was higher in charts than Rookie and Knock Knock which is incredible because they were both released WAY after PWF.

-In August 2017, PWF was STILL in the TOP50 of Gaon. That's in its 10th month of release.

-At some point, PWF was charting higher than MAMAMOO's 'Yes, I Am' which was released at the same time as AIIYL. ~(0_0)~

-PWF spent 54 weeks on the chart - the highest out of all these songs. They only got out of TOP100 this week - and I think by next update, it might even be back on TOP100.

-At some point, BP was the only group with two songs on TOP100 - PWF and AIIYL. Thats with the least amount of releases out of all these girl groups.

-Thanks to PWF's longevity, BP had 2 songs in Gaon's TOP100 consistently for all of 2017.

**AIIYL:**

-Contrary to popular belief did EXTREMELY well. Well enough to be a good enough contender for SOTY.

-2nd most streamed gg release of 2017 after Knock Knock. And thats only because it was released later in the year.

-Is the 4th most streamed idol group release this year after FXXK IT, Really Really and Knock Knock (O_O)

-In the long run, its catching up with Really Really which is currently the second most streamed release of this year after FXXK IT. Yall know what that means. It means soon enough it'll surpass KK and become third most streamed idol group release of the year and the most streamed gg release of the year.

-Is the 3rd most downloaded idol group release of the year. 2nd most downloaded gg song of the year. (o.o) AND STILL GOING STRONG.

-in comparison to RF which people have been claiming is the biggest gg release this year - AIIYL pales in initial streaming numbers but RF only had higher streams per week in comparison to BP for a while - int he long run, BP is ahead. This week, AIIYL actually ranked above Red Flavor for weekly streams. Despite being released almost a month before RF and despite RV releasing something new this week.

**Tl;dr:**

-BP is doing fckn well with 2 songs on the digital charts this year. Its actually crazy and scary how well they're doing. They're the QUEENS of longevity on the charts.

-PWF spent an entire year on the charts and the most weeks out of all these girl groups's releases after Cheer Up. It might even reenter the TOP100 in the future.

-AIIYL is the second most streamed gg release of 2017. And thats only because it was released late in the year. It is doing phenomenally well in the long run so we can ~actually~ expect it to overtake Knock Knock eventually.

-AIIYL is also the 4th most streamed idol group release for 2017 and 3rd most downloaded.

-BP is the only girl group that had 2 songs on Gaon TOP100 for all of 2017.

-People need to stop downplaying BP's digital success. They're the #1 group when it comes to longevity on the charts and this just goes on to prove it :) It is amazing that as a gg with not even 2 years of a career already has a release with above 100m streams, has a song that has spent some of the MOST weeks on the chart of ALL time, about to have 2 releases to have above 100m streams /(O_O)/

STOP. DOWNPLAYING. BP'S. DIGITAL. PERFORMANCE. IF THESE NUMBERS ARE ANY INDICATION - THEY'RE MASSIVELY LOVED BY THE KOREAN PUBLIC. ",23,25

1) Is the Hawaii trip only a short break, meaning they'll be back in Korea sometime in their new dorm and go on filming there?

2) Do you think they will film something else during their stay there (photoshoot, CFs, MV...) apart from BPTV? I mean, Lisa just changed her hair color right before the departure for Hawaii so it could mean something. 

3)Plus, if they're filming now and knowing it'll broadcast in Mid-December, does it mean we'll get (at least) a new song S***? I remember the ~~mediaplay~~ article saying ""the announcement of the new song is coming closer and they hope both foreign and K-fans will love it""

Heres a few of mine:


 Although its unlikely, a minimum of five songs PLEASE. I still cant fathom that these girls have yet to release a MINI album at least.


 Skinny goddess Jisoo getting more lines! They did her so dirty in As If Its Your Last with the line distribution. She deserves better. #JusticeForJisoo #ImWithHer


 Icon Ros getting a shot at a sub-rapper position (similar to Yeri from Red Velvet or Jungkook from BTS) where she tries out some rapping. At least just one song.


 Dancing legend Lisa getting some more vocal lines! I loved hearing her sweet voice in their cover of Loser and hope she gets more opportunities to sing, even though I love her rapping. Also, maybe some shots of her getting a dance breakdown solo in one of their videos (similar to Momo from TWICE).


 Queen Jennie getting to rap again! I love Jennies dynamic voice and think she adds to the vocal line of Jisoo and Ros, but I think we can all agree rap is really where miss Jennie Kim shines.


Overall, I just really miss our girls and will take anything honestly.",7,25

(Itune's Streaming service) However, they're now open to the public on SQ2 to be added to playlists. It's very weird, but it seems that they might be trying to appeal to US markets in a more streamlined way?

A weird note is though, once added to a playlist, you cannot listen to them. You also cannot listen to the MADE albums, or several 2NE1 or CL albums. Hopefully it's a mistake.
