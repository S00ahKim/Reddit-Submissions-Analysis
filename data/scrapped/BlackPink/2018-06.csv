I just wanted to share how well known Blackpink are in Perth,  Australia.  Generally,  kpop in Perth is only known by Asians or those with Asian friends.  BTS doesn't even play on radios like they do in the US.  So it is quite rare for white suburban families to come across kpop. 

I work at an after school care and during my work,  some kids asked to add songs onto a playlist to dance.  Two of the songs were Boombaya and Playing with Fire. I then asked how they came across Blackpink.  They said they just searched online (I'm guessing YouTube) and found these songs. Those were also their favourite songs. 

So all in all, great work in the number of views.  Blackpink really has a strong digital footprint.  I hope that through this comeback we can work together with kblinks to strength the fan base and make BP more well known.  ",12,53,False,self,,,,,

80,BlackPink,t5_3f8po,2018-6-9,2018,6,9,3,8pmcr7,self.BlackPink,Do you guys think Jennie should be the leader? (A general discussion on the roles and positions of BlackPink members),https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/8pmcr7/do_you_guys_think_jennie_should_be_the_leader_a/,Im_Currently_High,1528482840,"So I just wanted to start this discussion to get your opinions. Obviously the girls have talked about why they specifically didnt choose a leader, and for the longest time I kinda thought it made sense. But recently Ive been feeling more and more like Jennie is the unofficial leader of BlackPink. In general she just acts a bit more dominant than the other 3 girls and seems to take charge the most. I feel like it would also make the positions in BlackPink a bit more meaningful:

Jennie = Leader and secondary Rapper/Singer

Jisoo = Visual, Variety Queen, secondary Singer 

Lisa = Main Dancer and Main Rapper

Ros = Main Singer

To me, the raw musical talent in BlackPink is more with the maknae line, but this is NOT to take away what Jisoo and Jen bring to the table. (Im actually a Jisoo bias with Jen as a close second). But where Lisa and Ros bring the music/rap/dance prowess, Jennie and Jisoo tend to fill the Idol roles of the group. Kpop is about so much more than just the music, and thats what makes JenSoo so important. Jisoo makes BlackPink a pleasure to watch on variety and her Vlives are the best solo Vlives out there. Jennie brings the group together. She also perfectly personifies the duality concept of BlackPink. Jennie owns the black concept like a sexy model one minute, then flips a switch and immediately embodies the adorable pink concept. Jennie IS the BlackPink concept. For that reason, and the others Ive listed, I think she should be the leader.

Finally I just want to round this off by saying the beauty of BlackPink is that all 4 members are multidimensional and can fill any of these roles. I think thats the main reason we dont see more specific roles enforced in the first place, they just dont have to. But if we were to put more labels on their roles, what positions would you give them? And would you agree that, if they had a leader, it would be Jennie?

I'm itching to know.

Current sales we know:

* Japanese Package: 74K+
* Pre-order for 'Square Up' on Ktown4u: 18K+

* KTown4U is only one of the many sites people can us to pre-order the album.
* These are just pre-order numbers.
* Sales are naturally their highest in first 2 weeks of release and Korean sales will likely be highest at time of fansigns (which YG intends to do this time.)

Jennie expressed, I think thats why we feelconfident and have lots of expectations. Im happy that we can show BLACKPINKs musicality in a variety of ways.

Jisoo also commented on how she has personally been preparing for their comeback, saying, I have been practicing dance even more than I do normally since we have to show a powerful side to us that is different thananything we have doneup until now.

Long time J\-pop fan, pulled into k\-pop via TWICE (am sure I'm not the only one) and  just in the past few days started getting into BlackPink, binge watching everything on Youtube.

You here's my terrible confession. With the obvious exception of Lisa, I'm having a little trouble keeping track of who is who. Honestly it's mostly Jennie and Rose. Now Jisoo and Rose have the most obviously similar faces, but hair colour and Jisoo's snarky expressions means she's harder to miss. But when Jennie and Rose are dancing about I find I'm constantly second guessing myself. 

Am I the only one who had this problem when they first discovered the group?  I'm sure as I get more into the fandom, it will all become clearer, but right now I wish Rose would go back to the blonde hair she had in the earlier videos. Less confusing.",14,17,False,self,,,,,

As an American blink, I was so looking forward to Friday being the big day but since the release will be at like 3am CT that means the music services wont have the song available by their update time at around 12am EST. It just sucks the songs wont likely be out in the US until SATURDAY here.

&gt;Ros commented, I worked hard to stay fit during our break. The choreography for this [title] track requires a lot of energy. I made lots of effort to exercise so that I would be able to perform the choreography till the end.

&gt;In regards to their break, Lisa shared, We got to make a lot of good memories. Recently we started raising a cat, and weve been having a great time.

&gt;As their upcoming title track DDU-DU DDU-DU is set to be released on June 15, Square Up will be BLACKPINKs first release in about a year, and is produced by Teddy.

&gt;Jisoo said, Weve never formally released an album so the fans must have been waiting a lot, but while we were participating in the making of the album, we also really thought a lot about what the fans would like. We decided to let go of [any] burdens. If we felt burdened, we wouldnt be able to show everyone what weve prepared. When we first debuted, we had that kind of [mindset] and so this time our attitude has shifted.

&gt;Jennie added, We wanted to present a high-quality album. We felt sorry to our fans for the delayed comeback, but we will work hard during promotions so that [fans] wont feel like it was such a [long] break.

&gt;In regards to Teddy producing the album, Jennie replied, From the beginning, we consulted with Teddy for the concept and music, and he took the ideas we had to write the songs.

&gt;BLACKPINKs title track DDU-DU DDU-DU is a refined, powerful hip hop track that incorporates onomatopoeia in a refreshing way and includes lyrics that give off a chic and confident vibe. Jennie explained, You can interpret DDU-DU DDU-DU as either the sound of a gunshot, or the sense that were casting a powerful spell.

&gt;In terms of the performance, Jisoo commented, This song has a long dance break. For that part, we will be able to show a powerful performance. In the second verse, theres rapping, but it also includes some awesome choreography. If you watch our performance, it will leave a good impression and perhaps make people want to watch it more.

&gt;BLACKPINKs first mini album Square Up is set to have double title tracks DDU-DU DDU-DU and Forever Young, as well as b-sides Really and See U Later.

During their comeback press conference held on June 15 at Seoul's M-CUBE, the BLACKPINK members were asked about any behind episodes from their MV filming. **Lisa replied, ""A parrot appears in the MV, and it was so cute and sweet. I was thankful it stayed still.""**

**Ros shared, ""You'll be able to see it in the making-of film, but I had a lot of fun riding the chandelier. I like heights, so I was excited when I heard I'd be riding the chandelier. But when I arrived on set, the chandelier wasn't as high up as I'd expected, so I asked for it to be raised up, and I rode it higher up than it was supposed to be. I wanted the thrill!""**

&gt;The dance break during the interlude is also very impressive. JISOO displayed confidence by stating, Well present a strong performance during the dance break. The rap part became fiercer compared to our previous releases, and our choreography will complement that. It was fun practicing our choreography and vocals, and we became closer to each other. People will look for the song if they watch us perform.

&gt;BLACKPINK stated, We know that the fans missed us. We will have our first fan signing event. Were excited to meet the fans at a closer range during the event. We are preparing various events, since the fans have been waiting for us for a long time.

&gt;They added, Us members traveled and spent time with family while preparing for this album. We had time to heal ourselves. We feel happy to show ourselves with a degree of completion, and well be happier when it becomes 6 PM today.

At least thats what they say on Forever Young, one of the four songs off of their second EP Square Up, released today (June 15). It marks their first new music since last Junes chart-topping As If Its Your Last.

&gt;Square Up features four songs, all co-produced by YG Entertainments in-house producer Teddy Park, and is fronted by the single Ddu-Du Ddu-Du, a fierce hip-pop track overflowing with charisma from Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo, and Ros. Lyrically, the song is a banger of an anthem all about BlackPinks success, based around the hook of Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du.

&gt;When you say Black, we say Pink, says Jennie in her first verse. We are pretty savage. Our two hands are full of a fat check, raps Lisa in the following stanza. If youre curious, fact check.

&gt;When you say Black, we say Pink, says Jennie in her first verse. We are pretty savage. Our two hands are full of a fat check, raps Lisa in the following stanza. If youre curious, fact check.

&gt;The EP contains three other tracks, including the beachy, moombhaton-based ""Forever Young,"" within which they declare that BlackPink is ""the revolution."" It's followed up by ""Really,"" a chill hip-pop track that serves as a more feminine counterpart to labelmates iKONs Love Scenario."" The album's final track See U Later is a cutting breakup track with a playful vibe that weaves between numerous genres, with 00s-laced dance-pop leading into the dramatic, trap-laden chorus, and a hypnotizing, horns-laced breakdown. Overall, the album has a more aggressive, hip-hop slant than the act's prior releases, emphasized by the use of English-language profanity in Forever Young and See U Later,"" a rarity in music put out by K-pop girl groups.

&gt;Despite only having five songs to their name prior to Square Up's release, BlackPink has proven to be immensely popular since their start in 2016; each of their prior tracks have peaked within the top 5 of the World Digital Song Sales chart.

(Disclaimer - I am a huge huge hugeee fan of BP, to the point that I actually stayed up to watch the new MV at 4am, which I haven't done for literally any other group in *years,* not even BigBang. I love BP, I want to be them \[who doesn't\], etc etc.). HOWEVER, the one issue that comes up the most for them amongst kpop fans is that they have little to no stage presence. Nothing about their performances really shakes you to your core and makes you want to watch a certain stage time and time again. Of course, they're only two years into their careers, but I honestly think that they've somehow managed to actually *lose* what little charisma they had at debut. I've watched every single music show performance they've done since debut, and after I watch that day's performance two or three times, that's it. I don't have any interest in re-watching it; in fact, after about 3 days I seriously can't even remember what the performance looked like, not even what the stage looked like*! (save for the weird giant head projection from debu*t). 

As much as I hate to make a 2NE1 comparison, I simply have to in this case considering they're A. 2NE1's successors, and B. being touted by both YG and stans that they're incredibly different from other girl groups, similar to how 2NE1 was viewed. Let's take just one part from today's [Forever Young performance](https://youtu.be/n7ukhNJvQ8s?t=185) as an example: this part of the choreo just feels awkwardly lifeless, and it's not the fault of the choreo. Even Lisa, BP's primary source of stage presence (imo), can't make this look any better than the rest of the members. Had this choreo been done by CL or Minzy in particular, it would've looked cool, sultry. They have that gaze during slower dances that holds your attention and begs you to wonder what's going to happen next. BP as a whole, on the other hand, literally has two facial expressions they make nearly every. single. time: a blank-faced stare or a smirk/smile. I'll even be generous and acknowledge that Jennie and Lisa will occasionally do the well-known [rapper snarl](https://i.gyazo.com/c2ba5b5f89f57f50672362802ada3906.png). They're all so pretty that that's literally all they have to do to get your attention. The issue lies in the fact that there's simply nothing there to KEEP your attention after you stop focusing on their looks. There's no feeling behind the lyrics; no passion in the dancing; no emotion in their faces. 

[Watch this performance of CL](https://youtu.be/1zwHZ39b-_k?list=PL0D8CC90D599AF1CD) from just over FOUR years ago. Yes, this is a performance from FOUR. YEARS. AGO. that I can recall almost every detail of: it makes you want to be there to actually witness the hype itself. Now I've never been a fan of CL's yelling rap style, but regardless of how you feel about the style, you truly feel like she's calling out to you. You feel the energy in her words, she dances with no regard to whether she's going to look pretty and put-together afterwards, and she truly looks like she wants to be there. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o1LnPKgGtY) are [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBjKcN_Nbu0) of 2NE1's older performances as a group comparison to compare where they were around 2-3 years post-debut. The difference in power and charisma is simply off the charts. Even if you compare 2NE1's weakest member Dara, while she may not have the natural force that CL has (which is overwhelmingly greater than any other female idol pretty much), you can at least tell that she's *trying*.  BP looks like you should be grateful they decided to even show up when they perform; 2NE1 looks like they never want to get off the stage when they perform.",29,10,False,self,,,,,

They not only conquered music charts in Korea, but also foreign charts in 44 different countries, proving their worldwide influence. They also surpassed 40 million views in the first 27 hours in YouTube, which serves as an index of global popularity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite being vacant in the K-Pop scene for 1 year, BLACKPINK is showing massive influential power. Their first mini album SQUARE UP released back on the 15th topped iTunes Album Charts in 44 different countries. The countries include Germany, India, japan, Netherlands, and New Zealand.  
&gt;  
&gt;YouTube and iTunes serve as indexes that objectively represent global recognition and popularity. BLACKPINK achieved positive results on both platform without special promotional activities overseas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their achievements in Korea are also untouchable. The title song DDU-DU DDU-DU topped music charts including Mnet, Melon, Genie, Naver Music, Soribada, Bugs, and Olleh Music in 2 hours since its release, while other tracks from the album were also ranked high in various music charts.  
&gt;  
&gt;The MV for the title song hit 10 million views in 6 hours, 20 million views in 13 hours, 30 million views in 23 hours, and 40 million views in 27 hours, re-writing every existing record set by K-Pop girl-groups.

&gt;  
&gt;Members of BLACKPINK have previously stated, We prepared with sincerity for the fans who have waited for us for 1 year, so please show love and support at a press conference. They added, We love every single track from the album, so please look forward to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;JENNIE stated, We felt like it was a long time as well. But we worked on many songs while preparing for our comeback. We have done more than 4 songs we are releasing with the album. We wanted to meet the fans as soon as possible, but we wanted a degree of completion, so we had to pay attention to detail. We are now confident that we can make up the time we were absent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, BLACKPINK will actively engage in promotional activities in Korea from now on. They have received positive reviews from the fans and related officials through their comeback performances at MBC Music Core and SBS Inkigayo.

It has been a few days since, and it still has not been uploaded to their V Live channel. I realize some people have uploaded it on Youtube, but Ive only seen sub par quality ones, and Im not trying to watch those. I was wondering if anyone knows if/when it will be uploaded to Blackpinks V live channel? Does it usually take this long? Maybe Im just impatience. Anyways, any info would be appreciated.

I think all the girls are great &amp; super talented and I'm not trying to say they aren't through this post.

With their latest comeback, I've noticed that Black Pink don't seem to be improving their performances to the level of other YG artists. I want to know if you guys have noticed this and why you might think they haven't?

When you compare their stages to those of 2NE1, Big Bang, iKon or Winner, they aren't as involving or as enjoyable to watch. By this, I'm referring to things like audience interaction, not sticking so strictly to choreography 100% of the time, and looking like they're having fun while performing. When you compare their performances to those of other YG artists at award shows there's a clear difference of stage presence. Out of all the YG line up, I think BP is the worst at putting on performances.

I used to think that maybe they'll improve over time, but I then I consider how iKon &amp; Winner were both great at performaning since debut. This might be the fact both teams went on the YG Family Tour so got firsthand experience with Big Bang &amp; 2NE1 on how to perform though.

Anyone else have thoughts?",13,0,False,self,,,,,

&gt; The four members posed stylishly in various dresses, sneakers, colorful leggings, and over-sized shirts.

&gt; In the interview following the photo shoot, the members were asked what was the biggest change since their debuttwo years ago. Jisoo responded, We gaineda sense of responsibility to meet thefans expectations. Before we debuted, wesimply wished there was a stage we could perform on and that we just had fans, and we wondered if they would like us or not. Now, we feel like we have to make a lot of effort to satisfy more people.

&gt; When asked if they ever missed Korea while promoting in Japan, Lisa replied, There were times when I wanted to eat Korean ramen. I like Japanese food. I like sushi, tempura, and rice bowls. However, I found myself thinking, This would be perfect with [Korean] ramen and kimchi.'

&gt; On when they felt the most grateful to each recently, Jennie answered, We each had personal time to ourselves for awhile, then when we got together in a room to chat for our promotions, it felt like the switch of unity was turned on. It was reassuring that we were on the same wavelength even if we had been apart. Since the members are each doing their parts, I feel responsible, as well.

&gt; Ros shared, The members are very important people in my life. Sometimes were friends, sometimes were family, and we can also learn from each other and grow. When I have a hard time, I go to Jisoo in the next room, and I go to same-aged Lisa to talk about aspects we empathize about. When I need advice, I go to Jennie.

&gt;During the show, Ros revealed, My actual ideal type is Goo Yoo, and explained, I have liked him since Coffee Prince, and I am a huge fan. I saw the drama once in Australia and two more times after coming to Korea.

&gt;She continued, I cried when Gong Yoo fell off the train at the end of Train to Busan. I also cried watching Goblin.' She sent him a finger heart as she added, I love you.

&gt;The other BLACKPINK members chimed in by commenting that they are all fans of Gong Yoo, as well.

&gt;Ros also shared that if she had a free day without a manger, she would want to go to an amusement park and continuously ride rollercoasters. When asked what she would do if Gong Yoo passes by, she shyly responded, Then I would just have to let it all go and stare at him.

&gt;BLACKPINK displayed their unique individual charms through the celebrity style magazine HIGH CUT, which will be published on June 21. They looked perfect wearing unique outfits including glamorous dresses and sneakers, colored leggings, and oversized shirts long enough to cover ones feet. JISOO displayed elegant girlish beauty, JENNIE displayed cat-like eyes, LISA emitted strong aura, while ROS displayed a mystic vibe. The unique individual charms by all members completed a fan becoming entrance in 4 different ways.

&gt;BLACKPINK made comeback on June 15 with their first mini album, SQUARE UP. On the question asking about the biggest difference between now and 3 years ago when BLACKPINK first made debut, JISOO stated We now have responsibility to meet up to the fans expectations. Before debut, we just thought I want to perform on stage, I wish I had fans, and Will the people like our music. Now, we have to work harder to satisfy our fans. Even when youre perfectly ready, that doesnt mean youll be able to display your 100&amp;#37; to the audience.

&gt;When asked about the most appreciative moment from other members, JENNIE answered We had our personal time for a while. When we gathered in a room again to discuss our comeback, we felt like we turned on the unite switch. I felt reassured when I realized all of us had the same mindset even though we were away from each other. I also felt responsibility since all members are performing well on their given roles.

&gt;On the question Did you ever miss Korea while working in Japan, LISA answered, I missed Korean ramen. I like Japanese food, including tempura gyudon and sushi. But I also felt, this would be perfect with ramen and kimchi.

&gt;ROS revealed her affections on the members by stating Our members are really important people in my life. They are friends, family, and people I can learn from to become a better person. I visit JISOO next door when I go through hardships and empathize with LISA as a friend. I go to JENNIE when I need advice. We are positively influencing each other in various ways.

&gt;BLACKPINKs pictorial will be available through the 224th edition of HIGH CUT being published on June 21.

&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINKs comeback with the mini album Square Up and title track DDU-DU DDU-DU is doing incredibly well, killing charts and breaking records with music video views for DDU-DU DDU-DU on YouTube. However, their first performance wasnt as good as theyd hoped, said BLACKPINK.  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked if Yang Hyun Suk complimented them after their first music show, the BLACKPINK members said, It wasnt a compliment, but advice. He said that we were so nervous that we didnt perform to our potential. We were a little disappointed after watching our first performance, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;The members then talked about what kind of variety shows theyd like to appear on, highlighting their strengths and interests. Lisa wants to appear on a show where she can dance, while Ros wants to join a mokbang program, since she likes to eat.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie said, I like babies, so I want to join a childcare program. I think Id be good at watching the kids, while Jisoo said she wants to be on an easy-going variety program that wouldnt make her nervous. A show with animals would be fun, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jisoo went on, saying that broadcasts have gotten much easier for her lately, and that shes become more confident. But wed have to see about variety shows. Jennie added, \[Jisoo\] is really funny, and Ros said, She has a unique style of dad jokes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie also talked about the visuals of the group. When asked if she thinks that she is number one visual of the group with no makeup, she said, I dont think so. I think everyone has their own style. If I were to pick the number one visual in the team, it would be Jisoo.  
&gt;  
&gt;But upon being asked, Jennie said she wouldnt want to be born again as Jisoo. I would want to be born as me. I think Jisoo just has a certain charm that I dont have. Talking about the charms of the other members, Jennie added, Lisa has large eyes, and her features are very distinct, like a Barbie. You can see her clearly even from afar. Ros is mellow, but sexy. Shes normally \[cute like\] a squirrel, but when were doing photo shoots, she changes.

I love this album so much, and the girls of Blackpink. They're so charismatic and awesome. However, the more we learn about this album and the more I listen to it, the more my heart is aching about it. It's become glaringly obvious that these songs were meant for 2NE1. I can hear their voices as clearly as Jennie, Rose, Lisa or Jisoos during the songs. 
I am almost curious if 2NE1 even completely recorded this exact album and when YG dicked them over, decided he wanted to replace them with a new group to remake it because he knew it would be popular. (""2NE1 is the revolution"" rolls off the tongue pretty easy, doesn't it?)
I'm sure a lot of people are thinking at least something similar, and I'm not doubting BP at all by this post. I love them like crazy... but I also remember feeling this same way every time 2NE1 dropped a new track and how the world went crazy for it. I also don't want to be eternally comparing the two groups, and I never have before this album, but it's just on my mind so much I wanted to vent to others who might understand. 


TLDR: I am feeling very bittersweet listening to Square Up. I love BP so much and they killed it, but I also feel like I am reliving what 2NE1 should have been thru this album and it makes me sad for what they weren't allowed to do. ",9,0,False,self,,,,,

&gt;  
&gt;On June 21, the girl group spoke about their similarities with the DJ and comedienne Lee Guk Joo.  
&gt;  
&gt;Talking about how much she likes the comedy program Comedy Big League, Jisoo said, I like imitating. So when I watch it, I become ambitious about comedy. Its so fun watching it, so I want to go and try doing it. I like saying \[funny things\], using popular phrases, and like everything on Comedy Big League.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lee Guk Joo replied, Were always ready, so when you get the time, Ill put you in the segment that you like.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie praised Lee Guk Joos cooking skills and the comedienne said that shell visit the YG Entertainments company restaurant.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ros said, Instead of eating a lot, Im the type that enjoys what I eat. When I eat something yummy, my eyes tear up. There are times when Im so touched that I cry. These days, I really want to eat spicy noodles. Hearing this, Lee Guk Joo joked, Youre worse than me. I dont even cry while eating. Ive eaten 10 bowls of spicy noodles before.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisa chose cuteness as one of her similarities with Lee Guk Joo and sang BLACKPINKs DDU-DU DDU-DU with a cute voice. The title track off BLACKPINKs first mini album Square Up has been topping domestic and international charts.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are many dance cover videos of BLACKPINK songs on the internet. Jennie revealed, Whistle is difficult. Boombayah has big movements, so its easy to follow, but Whistle has a lot of grooves, so its the most difficult for me on stage.  
&gt;  
&gt;After choosing Lisa as the most playful member, Jisoo explained, She likes to lean on me, spin me around, and plays with me like a toy. Lisa commented, Her reactions are fun and I think she likes being attacked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie chose Lisa as the member with the most memorable first impression. She had short hair and tied a bit of her hair to create the apple hair, she said, She appeared with really wide-legged pants and danced, so I remember her the most. Jisoo added, The point of that hairstyle is that the happier she is, the looser it gets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisa then picked Jisoo as the most memorable member. She explained, She looked so innocent and wore a red hoodie.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ros named herself as the member who is easily pranked. Jisoo added, Its definitely not Jennie. If something seems suspicious, shell say, Wheres the camera?  
&gt;  
&gt;When a listener asked what language she dreams in, Lisa answered, I was also curious about that myself. Two days ago, I dreamt in Korean. The members added that when Lisa gets scared, she reacts in Korean and says, Mom, wait a minute in Korean to her mom over the phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;For their No. 1 promise, Jisoo said, I say this a lot, but I like the other members rap parts a lot, so I want to swap parts and do it as I want to.

&gt; This makes it the fastest K-pop girl group music video to hit this milestone, beating TWICEs previous record of about 22 days, 14 hours, and 40 minutes with Likey.

&gt; The music video has been consistently breaking records for every subsequent 10 million milestone, having surpassed 70 million views just two days ago on June 20. It also currently holds the record for the most amount of views in the first 24 hours for a K-pop girl group MV.

&gt; Congratulations to BLACKPINK and BLINKs! Give the music video another watch in celebration!

&gt;  
&gt;In an interview with 'E Daily', Yang Hyun Suk sat down and talked about the elements surrounding Black Pink's successful comeback.  
&gt;  
&gt;""*This is only the beginning for BLACKPINK. They have just begun to bloom, so we believe that they will soon bear fruit,*"" said Yang Hyun Suk. ""*Our fans tend to call them 'the jewel box', but the box hasn't even been opened yet.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding their latest song ""DDU-DU DDU-DU"", Yang Hyun Suk confessed that he was doubtful about the song's impact at first. ""*The decision to choose the song as the title track was a big challenge, as well as a gamble for us,*"" he said. ""*We thought that the rap portions were too strong to suit the preferences of the masses.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the girls of BLACKPINK had revealed that they fell in love with the track at first listen. When the reporters talked about BLACKPINK's rather 'soft' personalities, the CEO answered, ""*Since BLACKPINK does not have much experience in social life, their mentality is rather weak. To put it nicely, it is because they are pure and innocent.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;Yang Hyun Suk also compared the tactics of BLACKPINK to heavy preparation for a soccer game. ""*I am making this comparison as it is currently the World Cup season, but the most important thing in winning a game is to make a surprise attack. I believe that BLACKPINK's key to success is that they have a totally different tactic to take the other by surprise, every time.*""  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, the CEO refuted any suggestions of comparing BLACKPINK to **2NE1**. ""*I was certain that people would make comparisons at first,*"" said Yang Hyun Suk. ""*But the only reason was that Black Pink's debut slightly overlapped with 2NE1's disbandment. And that there were four members. Beyond that, I believe that the differences in the strengths and weaknesses of each member will eliminate such similar comparison in the future.*""

&gt;  
&gt;This old man who appeared on Yoon Ohyoungs essay shaped his bat until his product became the best, putting in time and effort despite the buyers urge and demands. He did not give up shaping the bat, although the buyer urged him to stop by saying thats enough. The buyer was mad at the old man who made him miss his train, but gets surprised when his wife praises the bat in the end. It was craftmanship.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the criticisms YANG HYUN SUK faces often is that he takes too much time. Artists from YG always takes a long time to release a product. The fans urge and demand while complaining thats enough, but it often takes over a year. Girl group BLACKPINK, known as YGs jewel box made debut 3 years ago back in 2016, but was vacant for 1 year until recently.  
&gt;  
&gt;The product released by the producer shaping the bat proved that JENNIEs wasnt bluffing when she stated, Im honestly confident. Music charts all over the world were colored in black and pink when BLACKPINK released their first-ever mini album SQUARE UP on the 15th.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of today (23rd), the title song DDU-DU DDU-DU is maintaining its all-kill status in major real-time music charts including Melon, Bugs, and Genie for 9 consecutive days. The album SQUAR UP set a milestone among K-Pop girl groups by topping iTunes Album Charts in 44 different countries, while proving the groups popularity in Japan by topping Japan Oricons Digital Album Chart. Furthermore, they were placed at no. 17 on UKs Official Trending Chart Top 20 for the first time as a K-Pop girl group, while topping 5 charts including the Comprehensive New Releases Chart, Popularity Index Chart, and KPOP Weekly Chart of Chinas QQ Music.  
&gt;  
&gt;The group not only captured the ears of listeners, but also the eyes. The MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU surpassed 10 million views in 6 hours since the album was released (MV release) and surpassed tens of millions of views approximately 5 times faster than the previous record held by K-Pop girl groups, and finally surpassed 80 million views in 160 hours on the 22nd. The previous record holder for the MV with the fastest 80 million views was also BLACKPINK, with their song AS IF ITS YOUR LAST.  
&gt;  
&gt;While it seems certain that the MV will surpass 90 million views this week, they are also expected to shorten the previous record (36 days) held by girl group TWICE, up to approximately one fifth. Furthermore, they will add one more MV into their over 100 million views MV collection, in addition to BOOMBAYAH and AS IF ITS YOUR LAST that have over 300 million views.  
&gt;  
&gt;Only FAKE LOVE by BTS can compete with BLACKPINKs unstoppable rise in MV view counts. They not only swept titles for the shortest amount of time in K-Pop girl-group history, but also had the highest rank among all girl groups in the world and was ranked 4th among all artists in the world according to the Top 10 Most Viewed MVs in the First 24 Hours announced by U.S. Billboard.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite achieving so much, representative producer YANG HYUN SUK states, Its only the beginning. The 1 year was a period of improvement and growth rather than a simple vacancy. On the interview he had with EDAILY on the 22nd, he made us expect more for tomorrow rather than being carried away by stating, The flower just began to bloom, so the tree will soon bear tasty berries.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- 80 million views in 160 hours, 4th** **best record in the world, and even more. What meaning do they have.**  
&gt;  
&gt; Firstly, I would like to thank everyone that supported BLACKPINK. Im looking at results that are hard to believe, and feel that the K-Pop scene has become a market that is unpredictable, even by relevant experts. The overseas expansion of K-Pop has changed a lot in the past couple of years. And even now, its changing very fast. As a ball player who gets behind gets less chance to score goals, its hard to win opportunities in the content business if one gets behind the trend.  
&gt;  
&gt;Who would be able to clearly explain how a geographically small country like Korea fosters so many artists that are popular in Asia and worldwide? I really dont know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since its the World Cup season, Ill compare it to soccer. If you want to win against your opponent, youll need talented players but its equally important to have strategy that can take your opponent off guard. In the case of BLACKPINK, I believe their popularity comes from something the fans cant find in their own country Its a team with entirely different tactics and strategy.  
&gt;  
&gt;The journey of BLACKPINK begins now, in their 3rd year since debut. They started blooming beautiful flowers, and I believe they will soon bear delicious berries.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- The members said that as soon as they heard DDU-DU DDU-DU, they knew it was it. How did you feel when you first heard the song.**  
&gt;  
&gt; I didnt know BLACKPINK said that. (Laughs) Actually, it was more of a gamble and challenge for me and TEDDY to select DDU-DU DDU-DU as the title song.  
&gt;  
&gt;We felt that since the track is fierce and contains a lot of rap sections compared to BLACKPINKs previous releases, it may lack popularity among the public. At the same time, we felt that its a big mountain well have to conquer, eventually.  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing I was confident about was that the songs BLACKPINK has been practicing for the last 6 years were closer to BLACK rather than PINK. We successfully conquered the mountain, so well aim for higher mountains and present more bold music in various genres from now on.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- Not only the song and the performance, but also the color, fashion, and the MV were like a total package.**  
&gt;  
&gt; Me and TEDDY have worked for over 20 years as producers, so we just know each other too well. We know what kind of facial expressions we have and how each other feels even without looking. In the case of BLACKPINK, TEDDY plays a huge role. He is in charge of the music and MVs, which is the most important. I take care of the other things, but we share each others progression and opinions throughout the process.  
&gt;  
&gt;It took approximately a year until DDU-DU DDU-DU was released to the public due to various circumstances, but I am pleased with the results as I personally think that the MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU had the highest quality among all MVs released by BLACKPINK. The video for DDU-DU DDU-DU was directed by Seo Hyunseung who has been working with YG for 20 years, and since we understand each other and the color of the music well through long meetings, we were able to come up with a great product in the end.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- During the 1-year vacancy, how did BLACKPINK grow and develop.**  
&gt;  
&gt; Its more like a process of revealing their talent accumulated during their 6-year training, rather than displaying their growth that happened during the past year. They are like a jewel box that hasnt fully opened yet, as the fans refer to. BLACKPINKs hidden talents and skills will soon shine even brighter.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- TEDDY and BLACKPINK, do they have a unique synergy effect.**  
&gt;  
&gt; TEDDY is YGs main producer that stayed relevant for the past 20 years, while creating numerous hits. For a designer like TEDDY, BLACKPINK is the perfect model and brand to dress the latest trend and music. Many people compared BLACKPINK with 2NE1, and it was inevitable since their break-up and debut timeline were crossing and each group were consisted of 4 members. But the models are different and each member has different strengths, so the comparisons will soon disappear.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- The charismatic 4 women on stage are girls full of tension, when they are at a press conference.**  
&gt;  
&gt; BLACKPINKs strength and weakness is that they are mentally weak, since they did not experience social life that much. In other words, they are pure and innocent, but I often demand them to get tougher on stage.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- How would you like to lead BLACKPINK, in a producers perspective.**  
&gt;  
&gt; As one can see from YouTube view counts, BLACKPINK is popular not only in Korea, but also popular overseas. Since 3 out of 4 members are fluent in English, that will work as a strength in running promotions overseas in the future. It may be too early to say this but since many foreign labels and producers are paying close to BLACKPINKs success, we will soon be able to share good news in the near future. They will release a new song this year one more time, and actively participate in tours overseas. Its an artists dream to meet, communicate, and sing for the people supporting them from far away. I would like to thank the fans again, for all the love and support.

712,BlackPink,t5_3f8po,2018-6-23,2018,6,23,21,8t9hw6,self.BlackPink,"Yang Hyun Suk Candidly Speaks About BLACKPINK, Their Success, And Future Plans",https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/8t9hw6/yang_hyun_suk_candidly_speaks_about_blackpink/,BrrrrRAMBO,1529755419,"&gt;Yang Hyun Suk recently sat down for an interview where he talked about BLACKPINK and their most recent success.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK released their first mini album Square Up on June 15, and so far it has been a huge success. Their title track DDU-DU DDU-DU recently became the fastest K-pop girl group music video to reach 80 million views on YouTube. The group also achieved perfect and certified all-kills and their mini album topped over 38 international iTunes charts. BLACKPINKnot only topped Oricon and QQ Music charts as well, but they also became the first K-pop girl group to enter the United Kingdoms Official Singles Charts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yang Hyun Sukstarted the interview by thanking those who had supported and loved BLACKPINK. He explained that their success was hard to believe as the music scene was changing significantly and rapidly, and that it was difficult to be one step ahead in such an industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;He compared the group to soccer and commented, If you want to beat your opponent, its important to have players that are skilled, but I also think its important to have a strategy that will beat the other team. If I were to form a small opinion on BLACKPINKs situation, they are probably receiving so much love because they have a completely different skill set and strategy that has never been seen before in this country. He added, This is only the start for BLACKPINK, who are in their third year of promoting since their debut. Theyve only just begun budding, soI look forward to seeing how they blossom.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yang Hyun Suk was then asked how he felt when listening to DDU-DU DDU-DU for the first time, as the members had previously shared that they had immediately thought it would be a hit when they first heard it. He commented, My thoughts were the complete opposite of theirs. For Teddy and myself, the decision to use the song as the title track was a huge challenge and gamble. He explained, Compared to the songs that BLACKPINK has released so far, its very strong and is rap-centered, so we thought it might not be mainstream enough. At the same time, I thought it was something we had to overcome sooner or later, and so we made our decision.  
&gt;  
&gt;He added, Although I was nervous, the one reason I was confident was the fact they had practiced more music that was closer to the black than the pink side of their name during their six years of being trainees, so I put my trust in the members. Thankfully, we overcame it and we will work towards a bigger challenge and more diverse music.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yang Hyun Suk then talked about the groups music video, and credited its color, fashion, and performance to Teddy. He explained that they had worked together for so long that they were extremely familiar with each other when working, and that they tended to share their ideas and thoughts freely.  
&gt;  
&gt;He expanded on the importance of Teddys role at YG, saying, Teddy is YGs main producer who has unwaveringly released many hit songs over the last 20 years. If Teddy were a designer, BLACKPINK is the amazing model and brand that he clothes with the newest and trendiest music. In the beginning, many people compared BLACKPINK to 2NE1. Their respective debut period and disbandment overlapped and since both groups had four members, there were certain pointsthat we couldnt avoid having them compared. However, the members as well as their strengths and weaknesses are all different so I believe that comparison wont last.  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked how the group had grown during their one-year gap between releases, he commented, Rather than saying that they grew during the year, we think its a process of showing the things they accumulated during their six years of training little by little. The fans refer to them as a treasure chest, but as of now, the lid hasnt even been opened yet. I believe that their skills and talent will continue to shine brighter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yang Hyun Suk also honestly talked about the groups weaknesses and shared, One area that is both BLACKPINKs strength and weakness is that they have a softer mentality than people think. Perhaps its because they arent havent experienced much of society as adults. If I were to put it nicely, they are innocent and pure. I believe they will become stronger the more they stand on stage.  
&gt;  
&gt;The YG Entertainment founder concluded by discussinghow he wanted to lead the group asa producer. He answeredby touching on their future promotions abroad, explaining how BLACKPINK has been seeing a strong response abroad and it will be to their advantage that three of the four members could speak English fluently.  
&gt;  
&gt;He added, Its a bit early to mention this, but many famous foreign music industry representatives have been watching BLACKPINK, so we think well have good news soon. We plan on releasing another new track within the year. We are also planning on an international tour after that to meet fans who have supported BLACKPINK from far away places, as meeting, communicating, and singing for those fans is a singers happiest dream. I want to thank everyone sincerely once again.

&gt;  
&gt;On the June 23 episode of JTBCs Idol Room, the girl group talked about the unique design of their recently unveiled light stick, which resembles a toy hammer with two pink hearts.  
&gt;  
&gt;When host Defconn asked the idols about the concept behind their light stick, Jennie began to explain, We were inspired by Weekly Idol before realizing her own mistake and abruptly cutting herself off in horror.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apologizing profusely for having accidentally mentioned Weekly Idol, which Jung Hyung Don and Defconn left earlier this year, she jokingly hit herself on the head with her light stick and corrected her earlier statement. Im so sorry, she said. We were inspired by a certain variety show.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie went on to elaborate, \[During our appearance on Weekly Idol,\] I was hit on the head with a toy hammer. Later on, when we were designing our light stick, I kept remembering that moment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jisoo and Ros laughingly chimed in, We thought, Thats it!'  
&gt;  
&gt;Jung Hyung Don then asked the BLACKPINK members if he could keep one of the light sticks, calling it really pretty, while Defconn enthused, I think the idea \[for the light stick\] is great.

&gt;BLACKPINK grabbed the viewers attention by bringing cheering sticks. They completed promoting their new song while explaining the behind story of making custom cheer sticks. The members posed in front of the spinning wheel to choose the heroine for the close-up camera. JISOO was selected as the Pick-dol.  
&gt;  
&gt;While challenging the Nano dance, BLACKPINK did not understand the rules completely, so they re-challenged with tension. BLACKPINK succeeded in the Nano dance while emitting charisma. When challenging the 357 dance, BLACKPINK failed since they were flustered by Thai and Chinese attacks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then it was time for the fact check corner. ROSs comfortable voice was mentioned as the 1st fact check. Jung Hyeong-don was fascinated by ROSs voice and raised his voice while stating You should really be a DJ. Your voice is perfect for a DJ.  
&gt;  
&gt;To fact check JISOO on her wish to release an album of childrens songs, 5-year-old children visited Idol Room. Members of BLACKPINK performed childrens songs, and checked their reactions. In the end, all members of BLACKPINK received 1 point each, resulting in a draw.   
&gt;  
&gt;JENNIE shared her thoughts on making appearance on Idol Room by stating It was an opportunity to find my new strengths. JISOO who was selected as the pick-dol displayed her expectations by stating, What did I do today? They were even filming me when I was taking a rest. Im nervous how it will show on screen, cant wait to see.

&gt;  
&gt;When BLACKPINK appeared with custom toy hammers, Connie asked What took you so long. JISOO explained It took us a while to bring out cool music. When asked about the toy hammers, JENNIE made a mistake by mentioning MBC Every1 Weekly Idol, the previous program, and made the people burst into laughter by repeating Im sorry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Donnie and Connie requested BLACKPINK to bring something for the Signal Song theyve been recruiting since May. LISA presented them a signature pose. LISAs pose was unique, but it was already performed before.  
&gt;

Donnie played cute jokes when JISOO kept on lagging. The MCs yelled 0 in Thai, and the members failed since LISA did not understand. BLACKPINK challenged once again with the song PLAYING WITH FIRE, but could not complete the mission due to Chinese attacks by Donnie.  
&gt;  
&gt;Donnie and Connie pretended to be sorry by stating Im sorry you failed the mission. We wanted to do everything for you, including the food truck. JISOO responded, Well accept your kindness although we failed, making the people burst into laughter.  
&gt;  
&gt;During the fact-check corner, ROSs golden voice and JISOOs children song singing skills were proven. LISA was also checked as the dance supercomputer. Members of BLACKPINK also challenged an arcade rhythm game called Pump.

&gt;  
&gt;The song they challenged was AS IF ITS YOUR LAST. However, JISOO made a mistake from the start and fell into the number trap. She described the games difficulty by stating Its a really hard game.   
&gt;  
&gt;When the game started, the members started to adapt and Jung Hyeong-don yelled soon, Thai for 0, as a fatal blow.  
&gt;

We have been gathering all the proof of malicious comments, posts, articles, etc and documentized them in pdf form and emailed(spammed) yg's office and now we are also commenting on yg's IG so he can act fast. This wasn't just Blinks idea but YG asked fans to report if any of this happens recently.

SO, if you want to participate you can copy and past this text and comment on YG's IG or like those comments Korean Blinks posted so it can be on the top. Thank you! Just letting all International Blink know what is going on in Korean Blink community right now.

They not only topped iTunes Album Charts in 44 different countries as soon as they made comeback, but was also placed at no. 17 on The Official Trending Chart Top 20 announced by UKs Official Chart, as well as entering the Official Singles Chart Top 100 as no. 78, proving their special presence in Europe.   
&gt;  
&gt;The MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU is also setting milestones by sweeping all time related records previously held by K-Pop girl groups. The video surpassed 90 million views in the first 8 days of its release, and will soon surpass 100 million views.   
&gt;  
&gt;The group also started their all-kill engine on Korean music broadcasts. BLACKPINK successfully won no. 1 trophies in MBC Show! Music Core on the 23rd, and in SBS Inkigayo on the 24th.

""DDU-DU DDU-DU"" wasone of four tracks on*Square Up,*along with the anthemic ""Forever Young,"" the breezy ""Really"" and theplayful ""See U Later.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The interest in BLACKPINKs return, which came a year after last Junes As If Its Your Last release, saw six of the groups songs rank on Billboards World Digital Song Sales chart. Not only did DDU-DU DDU-DU top that chart and the three other songs off of Square Up break into the Top 15, As If Its Your Last re-entered at No. 10 and Boombahya returned to No. 19.  
&gt;  
&gt;As one of K-pops most prominent rookie girl groups, BLACKPINK is the definition of quality over quantity. Though they have a sizable followingthroughoutthe globe, thefoursomehas only nine songs to their name ever since their debut in 2016 with the release of their first singles Boombayah and Whistle. Since then, theyve released five singles and two EPs, *Square Up* and last years *Blackpink,* which featured Japanese versions of five of their songs.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK now joinsBTS as thehighest-ranked Korean all-female and all-male teams, respectively, on American music charts. The girl group's success comes just a month after popular septet *Love Yourself: Tear* album became the first-ever Korean album to top the *Billboard* 200,and their track ""Fake Love"" appeared at No. 10 on the Hot 100 chart.

&gt;  
&gt;It goes without saying that the streets were packed for BLACKPINKs appearance. The group spent time with super fans of the group, and also did some shopping.  
&gt;  
&gt;They then changed location to a rooftop pool, where the members grabbed some drinks and sat down for an interview.  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked if they dont want to go on vacation, Jisoo said, We came back after a lot of rest, and Jennie added, We were missing work, and we really wanted to promote.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jisoo expressed excitement of the Square Up mini album being the groups first. Its our first after debuting; we had been releasing title tracks through singles, so its so nice having an album, and we really wanted to give \[an album\] to our fans.  
&gt;  
&gt;The interviewer said Jennies like YGs female G-Dragon, with her talent for rap and her incredible fashion sense. Ive liked clothes and looking at magazines since I was young. Im doing what I love, so I think thats why people are liking it, said Jennie.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the visual of the group, Jisoo was asked to pick what she likes most about her appearance, and she said her lips, to which Jennie said she was also going to say the same. When I smile, theyre kind of in the shape of a heart.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also on the show, Ros sang her version of B.o.Bs Not For Long, showing off her unique voice, and Lisa did her famous taxi dance.

They are setting milestones day by day, shaking the music industries Asia, the United States, and even Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK released their first mini album SQUARE UP on June 15 at 6 PM, through various music platforms. The album was produced by hitmaker TEDDY, who has been working with BLACKPINK since debut, and contains a total of 4 tracks including the double title songs DDU-DU DDU-DU and FOREVER YOUNG.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK made comeback in approximately 1 year, and the response from fans were explosive as they have waited that long. The group is currently displaying global influence by debuting on main charts in the world. What records have BLACKPINK set in 13 days since making comeback.  
&gt;  
&gt;**#Korea**  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK conquered music charts as soon as they made comeback. BLACKPINKs DDU-DU DDU-DU not only topped 8 real-time charts including Melon, Naver Music, Bugs, Olleh, Genie, Soribada, and Monkey 3, but also swept daily charts and are maintaining their perfect all-kill status for 13 days.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK set the record of surpassing 1 million users in a 24-hour period, which is the highest record among girl groups after the music chart reformation. The number of users during the 24-hour period is still far higher than previous no. 1 records, surprising people in the music industry. The song FOREVER YOUNG is also placed at no. 2 on various music charts, creating waves along with DDU-DU DDU-DU.  
&gt;  
&gt;**#United States**  
&gt;  
&gt;According to Billboard on June 25 (local time), BLACKPINKs DDU-DU DDU-DU will debut as no. 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 on June 30. The song DDU-DU DDU-DU was streamed 12,400,000 times and was downloaded 7,000 times in the United States, according the Nielson Music. The song debuted the Streaming Songs chart as no. 39.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is the first time BLACKPINK is entering the Billboard charts. It has been 9 years since a K-Pop girl group entered the charts, since Nobody by Wonder Girls was released back in 2009. BLACKPINK also entered the Billboard 200 as no. 40 with their album SQUARE UP. Its been 4 years since a K-Pop girl group entered the according chart, since 2NE1s Crush back in 2014.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moreover, BLACKPINK renewed all pre-existing records by K-Pop girl groups as they debuted at Billboards main charts including the Hot 100 and the Billboard 200. The record has more meaning since they achieved these results with songs in Korean, not in English. On the matter, BLACKPINK expressed their feelings by stating, We cant believe its really happening. It feels surreal.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK also entered other charts by Billboard. The group proved their influence by listing not only the tracks from their mini album, but also previous hits in the World Digital Song Sales chart. BLACKPINK also topped the Emerging Artists chart for the first time as a K-Pop girl group. The chart announces new and upcoming artists that are currently trending.  
&gt;  
&gt;**#UK, Europe**  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK also fascinated music fans in the UK and Europe. According to UKs Official Chart on the 22nd(local time), DDU-DU DDU-DU was placed at no. 78 on the Official Singles Chart Top 100.  
&gt;  
&gt;UKs Official Chart which is known as the 3 biggest charts in the world along with US Billboard and Japans Oricon is known for its conservatism. However, Official Chart emphasized BLACKPINKs success by writing, Congratulations. BLACKPINK becomes the first K-Pop girl group to enter the UK Official Singles Chart, through their official social media.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, BLACKPINK also entered Singles Charts in France and New Zealand for the first time as a K-Pop girl group, proving their massive influence worldwide.  
&gt;  
&gt;**#Setting New Milestones**  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, BLACKPINK set milestones as a K-Pop girl group by topping iTunes Album Charts in 44 different countries, Japan Oricons Digital Album Weekly Chart, Recochoku Album Daily Rankings, and by winning 5 crowns in QQ Music, which is Chinas largest music platform.  
&gt;  
&gt;With BLACKPINKs popularity, the MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU surpassed 100 million views on YouTube, on June 25 at 11:45 PM. The view count was achieved in 10 days and 5 hours, which shortened the previous time record by one third.

People were so enamored by hercelebrity statusand were busy taking a photo of her huge, glammed-up portrait in the background, failing to realize that the real person is just right in front of them.

BLACKPINKs Jisoo explained that both personas are versions of herself. One is her as a celebrity, and the other one is her as anordinary person.

So even when Im walking right in front of them, they just point their cameras at my picture on the wall, Jisoo explained during BLACKPINKs appearance on Arirang TVsPops In Seoul. People are only crazy about my celebrity look.

But when the ordinary Jisoo accidentally tripped, it gathereda lot of attention. In fact, all of the people who were admiring her portrait earlier suddenly directed their camera phones at her. However, their phones were turned into guns.

The metaphor behind this scene is that although in reality, people are just using their cameras to shoot her, there were moments that made her feel that she was shot by a gun because she felt attacked. Jisoo went on to say that people only care about her celebrity persona and would only show interest if her ordinary self-messed up.

As soon as I fall down though, they point their cameras at me as though they are about to shoot me, Jisoo shared. They show interest in me when Im a celebrity and are about to shoot me when Im down.

Jisoo's explanation just goes to show how hard it is to be a celebrity. People usually think that being rich and famous is the best feeling in the world, but the BLACKPINK singer revealed that being a part of the entertainment world is not all rainbows and butterflies at all.",3,62,False,self,,,,,

&gt; On the incredible response that theyve gotten for DDU-DU DDU-DU, Jisoo said, It was our first comeback in a year, so we worried a lot. After about six months, we just thought, we need to hurry and make a comeback, and once it became a year, we wanted to give our fans something new and fresh, since they waited for so long. Were so thankful that they liked it.

&gt; Jennie said they had a close eye on the charts. We were most worred about the song charting. Because thats how you know how many people are listening to the song. We wondered if people still remembered BLACKPINK, since our hiatus was long, so when we first saw our ranking, we were so surprised. When we saw that a b-side was also charting high, we were so moved.

&gt; The group also put forth a first place promise for this week, if they were to be No. 1 again. Jennie said, During filming for our music video, we throw popcorn up. If we have the opportunity, we want to try to have a fun performance where we throw popcorn up and catch it with our mouths.

&gt; According to news outlet OSEN, a high-ranking source at the agency revealed that the company is currently discussing potential overseas promotions for BLACKPINK with American record labels. The source stated, We are actively in contact with a number of leading American record labels regarding BLACKPINK. It looks as though we will be able to announce some good news in the near future.

&gt; However, the source added, **Since BLACKPINK has returned after a yearlong hiatus, for now, their domestic promotions come first. Because they had plenty of time to prepare, theyve already finished recording their next title track. Please look forward to it.**

&gt; As previously mentioned by YG Entertainment founder Yang Hyun Suk, BLACKPINK has reportedly received a great deal of interest from American music producers and industry representatives. The groups latest hit DDU-DU DDU-DU also became the highest-charting song by any K-pop girl group in history on Billboards famous Hot 100 chart earlier this week.

&gt;  
&gt;On the June 28 episode of SBSs radio show Boom Boom Power, BLACKPINK appeared as guests.Their MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU recentlyset a record for K-pop girl groups when it reached 100 million viewsin just over10 days since its release. Its also been topping music charts in Korea and it achieved the highest rankingfor a K-pop girl group on Billboards top song chart the Hot 100.  
&gt;  
&gt;Host Boom asked the membersif they can feel the enthusiastic reaction to DDU-DU DDU-DU. Jisoo said that rather than necessarily feeling the reaction personally, theyre often told by people around them, This happened! Did you see? She explained, It makes us go, Whoa. I cant believe it!'  
&gt;  
&gt;Boom brought up the amazing number of views on their MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU (which is now 114.9 million).Jennie said, I dont believe it. Its such a big number, so it doesnt feel real. I particularly couldnt believe that it reached 100 million views in 10 days.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK also shared stories from filming the music video for the song when Boom said hed heard it had been hard work. Jisoo said, Rather than it being hard work, it took a long time. It was tiring because there were different sets for each part and person.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the most talked-about scenes in the MV is the part where Jennie holdsa fennec fox. The fennec fox was like an adorable kitten or puppy and it was really well-mannered, so it was fun to film, she said. It got used to my hand faster than I thought, so there werent any problems while we were filming.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie also talked about the scene where she throws popcorn before she starts to rap. She explained, I was playing around, and they said it was funny and asked me to try it. It ended up coming out well in one take, and it made it into the music video.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another particularly memorable scene was the one where Lisa throws powder. The members explained that theyd all tried to do it, but it was really difficult, and Lisa ended up being chosen.Ros said, She did it in a cool way, and Lisa explained that shed practiced a few times.  
&gt;  
&gt;During the show, the members also talked about how Lisas Korean skills have improved a lot. Ros said, When something surprising happens, I thought that Lisa would react in Thai, but she naturally says things like Oh, Im surprised! or Oh my gosh! in Korean. Shell even call her mother mom in Korean on the phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most recently, BLACKPINK earned their third music show trophyfor DDU-DU DDU-DU on M!Countdown and swept Gaons charts.

&gt;The girl group returned to the music scene on June 15 and swept charts with their first mini album SQUARE UP. Their title track DDU-DU DDU-DU earned trophies on music showsand rose up on the Billboard with fantastic results.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie explainedthe reason why they chose DDU-DU DDU-DU as their title track, saying, The other songs were produced a long time ago. DDU-DU DDU DU was our most recent production, and it has a new vibe that we really needed.We thought it was appropriate. Its more powerful, and the performing parts are also different. We received great synergy from it.  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked if they had predicted the song would receive so much love, Ros said, We really hadnt expected it. We were actually very nervous. Because of our year-long break, we were worried that we might have been forgotten.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK also talked about their title as thehighest charting K-pop girl group on Billboard Hot 100. Lisa said, I heard that news in the morning andwas shocked. I still cant believe our name is on the website that I used to check out ever since I started to like music. Jisoo admitted, I thought wed never get on the main Billboard chart. I really cant believe it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ros stated, I thought my heart was going to stop. It encouraged me to work even harder with a new mindset. Jennie revealed, Its a chart that I, too, check once a week to see what songs are loved. Im so amazed and honored that our name is on there. It made me realize just how much love werereceiving.  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked about the reaction of Yang Hyun Suk and YG Entertainment, Jisoo answered, The agency congratulated us, but they didnt make a big deal out of it just in case we might get too excited. They kept telling us to focus on this weeks promotions. I think thats right. Still, Yang Hyun Suk congratulated us on social media right away. He always takes care of us silently, but when theres good news, hes the fastest one to congratulate us. Yang Hyun Suk promoted us a lot on his social media account this time. Were very grateful. Please pay attention to his social media account.

BLACKPINK shared their thoughts on these recent developments and more in an interview with OSEN.  
&gt;  
&gt;On their goals, BLACKPINKs Jisoo said, We dont intentionally choose a specific goal. If we set a goal and we achieve it, I think we may think, What do we now? I think its good to work hard at every second rather than being confused.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie added, Just the fact that we released a mini album makes me happy every day. I do imagine a bigger future, but Im working hard not to miss whats in front of me. Were starting our tour in Japan soon, and its one of the things that I dreamed about. One of the things on my bucket list is coming true.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie also commented on the excitement about year-end award shows by saying, If we get to go to the award shows, it would definitely be a really grateful thing and an honor. At last years awards, I was sad that we could only sing one song. Since we released many songs with our mini album this time, I think well be able to show you a variety of things if we were to perform at this years awards ceremony. So, were looking forward to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the groups recent success and interest from overseas, many are wondering about the possibility of BLACKPINKs entry into the U.S. market. Jisoo answered, We didnt come out planning to enter the U.S. market. Whether or not we go to the United States, were going to work hard to promote like were doing now.  
&gt;  
&gt;She continued, I think that entering the U.S. market will happen naturally like how water flows. Of course, wed be happy if we went to the United States, but were trying not to dwell on that too much. Were happy when we receive many good opportunities, but right now, focusing on our promotions in Korea comes first.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jennie said, We cant miss the present. Instead of being excited about future events, I want to try my best for promotions for this album. My goal is to achieve the things in front of me one by one.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINKalso talked about some of the reasons for their popularity. Ros answered, I wonder if its because we try new things. If you just look at our music, we try to attempt things that may be difficult forother girl groups. I also think people like seeing us perform with powerful choreography and vocals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead of just doing what were good at, we want to challenge ourselves, said Jennie. Since we attempt music thats challenging for us as well, I think fans welcome it thinking, Theyre doing these kinds of things too. We also pay attention to the details in our MVs. I think people search for and watch them because theyre fun to watch.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the difficulty of trying new things, Jennie explained, It fits our tendencies so well. I like that all four of us pursue the same things. We like to try new things and enjoy it. We come up with a variety of fun ideas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jisoo elaborated on some of BLACKPINKs changes in their appearance for this comeback. She said, For the outfits, we tried to give off feminineand hip hop style vibes. We also used lots of colors.  
&gt;  
&gt;We wanted to show a lot of our girl crush sides, added Jennie. I think we showed our gentle charms during our last promotions. This time, we tried to positively try many new things, so I feel happy about that.  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked if their agency, YG Entertainment, reflectedthe opinions of the members, Jisoo said, They listened to our opinions since our debut. They allowed us to do the music and concept that we wanted to do. I think these kinds of things became our foundation. I think just coming up with ideas gave us a lot of help.  
&gt;  
&gt;She concluded, The most memorable words I remember \[from a fan\] arewhen someone asked us to continue to create music that can be enjoyed for a long time. Those wordsare basically our goal. We want to put out good music that is good for anyone to listen to and people wont get sick of at any time. I feel so proud when I read praise from our fans and it sets my mind straight again.
