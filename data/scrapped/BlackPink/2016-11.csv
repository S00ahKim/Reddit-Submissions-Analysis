We have to go on a long journey for the same goal together and were good friends. That gives us many strengths. I think the best part about being BLACKPINK is being with these members. 

That is JENNIEs answer to a question about what the best part of being a member of BLACKPINK is. It has been only three months since BLACKPINKs official debut, but the members have built deep bond and friendship among themselves during the time of their training for four to six years. Therefore, the one who best understands BLACKPINK is the members themselves. This is BLACKPINKs stories told by BLACKPINK themselves about their appeals, ideal types of guys, and so on.

**- The teams name is BLACKPINK, who do you think best fit color black and pink?**

JISOO: I think black is the color for JENNIE. She likes to wear black clothes and her charisma on the stage fits the image of color black. Pink is for ROS. In French, ROS means pink, so even her name goes well with color pink. (What do you think is the color for you?) I think its pink and for LISA, its black. 

**- You had spent a long time being trained, what was your secret for healing yourselves from hardships in the process?**

ROS: The best time for me is when I cook and eat with the other members, and when I laugh with them watching TV.

JENNIE: I like to eat at small but good restaurants. Eating at those places with the other three are the best memories for me.

**- What kind of restaurants do you mostly go to?**

JENNIE: I find out information about good restaurants on the Internet. Weve visited many Thai restaurants as well. Thats not just because of LISA, but I really like Thai food. I think weve eaten at almost all good Thai restaurants. (Any recommendations?) We mostly eat in the Hongdae area, and there are many good Thai food places there.

**- LISA, do you like Korean food? What is your favorite?**

LISA: My favorite is gamja-tang (spicy pork back-bone stew). Ive never seen gamja-tang in Thailand and I first tired it in Korea. It was perfect for my taste. 

**- All of you seem to like eating very much, but you are in great shape. What is your secret?**

JISOO: We dont even need to do exercise, because we practice dance really hard. Everyone in our team really loves to eat, so we have to eat delicious foods. We control our shapes by reducing the amount we eat when necessary.

**- Please tell me whats good about the member sitting next to you.**

JENNIE: We shot Weekly Idol show yesterday and JISOO was so easy-going and humorous there. I think she will show such free and easy appeals much from now on.

JISOO: LISA is so charismatic on the stage, but shes actually like a little brother, not even a little sister, when not on the stage. She is so mischievous and she is cute like a little child.

LISA: ROS is friendly and talks very well usually, but she is also a shy girl. However, shes so cool on the stage and shes also very cool when paying guitar. Her voice is husky and attractive.

ROS: JENNIE may look not that friendly as she is confident, cool, sexy, and talented on the stage and on TV. However, she is actually a warm-hearted and cute girl. She is a charming and easy-going girl but I dont think many people know about what she is really like. She has such unexpected and unlikely appeal.

**- You sing love is like playing with fire. What kind of guys attract you?**

JENNIE: I like a man who does his best for his work.

JISOO: Im attracted to a nice guy who really likes me.

LISA: I like a man much older than me, who can take care of me.

ROS: I like a man with good voice. Im less attracted to those who have voices that dont match their images. (Whose voice do you prefer for duet?) Ive always liked songs of senior YG artists. If I could have an opportunity, I want to do duet performance with BIGBANG. That would a great honor for me.

**- All idol groups have their own nicknames. What kind of nickname do you want?**

JENNIE: Most nicknames are taken by other idol groups. So, I hope people see us and intuitively give us a nickname that perfectly matches us, like Oh, these girls should be called something!

30,2016-11-4,2016,11,4,1,5axn8m,"BLACKPINK talks about the #competition between 3 major music labels in Korea, #YG #2NE1",https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/5axn8m/blackpink_talks_about_the_competition_between_3/,BrrrrRAMBO,1478189855,"LISA whose favorite Korean food is gamja-tang (spicy pork back-bone stew), JISOO who threw a microphone away while swinging her arm during a rehearsal, ROS who was touched by fried chickens sent by DARA, and JENNIE who says right now (the interview) in a shaky voice when asked about what was the hardest time since BLACKPINKs debut. The real BLACKPINK out of the veil of secrecy triggered fandom with their cute appeals, not just with the intense performances on the stage that trigger girl crush.


Interviewers were even curious about how these shy and tender-hearted girls could present such powerful and intense performances on the stage.


In the interview, BLACKPINK was not just the monstrous rookie that dominated stages with overwhelming charisma. On the surface, the girls are like charismatic black, but inside, they are like shy pink. Girl group BLACKPINKs members in the interview, not on the stage, were cute shy girls who were even hesitant to speak about what it was like to come back.


The girls said that their happiest moment was when they were with fans. Even though BLACKPINK swept No.1 on music charts upon their debut and took No.1 in a TV music show in the shortest period of time since debut ever for a Korean girl group, they were rather excessively modest and knew how to appreciate the big support from fans.


**Its our first comeback after debut. Weve worked really hard for it, so please enjoy our new songs. Thank you. (ROS)**


**Just as you mentioned, this is a comeback like debut. Weve come back with new songs. Thank you for listening to our songs despite the fact that no performance has been unveiled yet. We were worried as we havent been exposed to the media after our comeback, but people like our songs. I really thank them. (JISOO)**


**Weve worked hard on our new songs, so Id like you to look forward to our performances as well. (LISA)**


**Weve come back with new songs PLAYING WITH FIRE and STAY. Were nervous but excited. (JENNIE)**


BLACKPINK members talked about what it was like to come back, with quivering voices. They were shy and cute like most other girls, somewhat differently from the charisma they displayed on the stage. Many people at the interview shouted, These girls are cuter than I expected. Then, what would have YGs CEO YANG HYUN SUK who directly picked and trained them felt like?

**Mr. YANG? Haha. Hes like my father. He shows us captured images of our good performances and says he feels satisfied, and when we make mistakes, he also sends us the images, asking what is this? He takes care of us like our father. (JISOO)**


**He was the first one who sent us the captured image when we took No.1 in a TV music show for the first time. We checked the message on our phones after receiving a trophy and found out that he sent the message right after we were announced as No.1. Haha. (JENNIE)**


The reason why BLACKPINK could take No.1 trophy in a TV music show within the shortest period of time ever for a girl group in Korea was because they had endured many years of hard training. Couldnt it be very hard for them to wait for indefinite debut and future?


**I had difficulties with communicating as Im a foreigner, but the other members helped me a lot. We relied on each other and that was how we could endure those days. (LISA)**


**We could rely on each other, as we had the common goal, interest, and objectives. (JISOO)**


**We went through inner struggles about if we could actually make debut. Once, our photos were unveiled to the public and news articles were written about us, so we thought we were making debut then. However, month after month passed with nothing happening, and then, five years have passed. Once the team was formed and the concept of our team began to be established, we could feel relieved. (JENNIE)**


The members also smiled, talking about other names that were candidates for the team other than BLACKPINK.


**Am I allowed to say this? Actually, we could have been pink-funk. There was baby monster as well, and the most shocking name was magnum. The name was like were transforming into something, but fortunately, we got this name of BLACKPINK. (JISOO)**


The members say that they feel like they are still trainees, even though it has been three months since their debut. BLACKPINK members lives are still the same with their lives before debut, going to practice when there are no official schedules.


Hard work always pays off. BLACKPINK swept seven music charts with their new songs PLAYING WITH FIRE and STAY. BLACKPINK also talked about the competition between the girl groups of three major music labels in Korea, which has been a hot issue recently. BLACKPINK said that building bigger recognition is more important now than thinking about that competition, showing a modest attitude.


**Were really grateful. Even though we havent presented any performances yet, many people are listening to our songs and loving us. Were really grateful. (JISOO)**


**As its been not that long since our debut, there are still many people who dont know who we are. So the most urgent thing for us to do is to expose ourselves more to the public, to make us better known. (JENNIE)**


LISA was asked to talk about what she remembers about the performances of WHISTLE and BOOMBAYAH. She humorously answered, JISOO threw away her microphone!


**Haha. When I was doing the dance of swinging my arm during a rehearsal, I threw away my microphone by mistake. Since then, I grab a mic so hard to the extent that my hand turns red. Haha. (JISOO)**


In the interview, BLACKPINK members were so cute, but they were not just innocent girls. They are feeling burdened by the fact that their label is YG Entertainment. They are also matured girls, who are struggling to follow the footsteps of their super-star seniors.


**We always monitor performances of senior YG artists. I believe that they display great energy and presence on the stage and that is the thing we need to learn most of all. Of course we feel burdened as all senior YG artists have achieved great success. We believe that we have to follow their footsteps quickly, so that were not left behind. (JISOO)**


To a question whether senior YG artists support BLACKPINK, ROS answered, Yes, everyone takes good care of us, as were the youngest team in the company. She also smiled, saying, Ah! Yes! We were practicing during the Christmas holidays and DARA sent us fried chickens. That was a very big support for us. BLACKPINK went on to talk about 2NE1.


**Were honored to be compared to them and we dont want to be different from them. Rather than wanting to show a different color, we just want to display YGs unique color. Even though it seems that were just following, I dont think that is bad. We want to follow their charisma and presence on the stage. (JISOO)**


Then, what are different strengths of each member of BLACKPINK?


**LISA speaks a good Korean. She uses Korean proverbs well, and that is really cute. (JISOO)**


**I think Im almost Korean now. (LISA)**


**She even eats gamja-tang (spicy pork back-bone stew), haha.**


**I think JISOO is the most different from what people think about us. In real life, she is full of humor and she is mischievous. She likes playing games and she is really easy-going. (JENNIE)**


**People at yesterdays shooting for Weekly Idol show said so, too. They said I looked wild on the stage but I was actually like a little child Haha. Everyone was a little bit surprised. (JISOO)**


When asked about the hardest time since their debut, JENNIE answered Right now in a quivering voice and smile shyly. She picked the time spent with fans as the happiest moment since BLACKPINKs debut.


**I feel the most nervous in interviews. I think that is because were on our own, without any direction from Mr. YANG. (JENNIE)**


**The happiest moment for me was when I met fans. I was surprised that so many people came to see us, and that was really exciting. (JENNIE)**


**I was impressed by our fans feedback for us. Their comments relieved and comforted me. I really appreciate them. (ROS)**


Then, what would be the feedback that BLACKPINK wants to get from fans the most?


**For PLAYING WITH FIRE, we put much focus on the choreography. I want hear from fans that our performance has been upgraded. STAY is an acoustic ballad and I want to hear that this kind of song is also good for BLACKPINK. (JISOO)**


**I hope BLACKPINK will be a girl group welcomed by many people any time. Also hope to be a girl group that everyone likes no matter what genre we perform.**

What do the other members mean to you?

(JISOO) Weve been together and relied on each other for such a long time, so we just cant live without the others. Every one of our team is so important. I wanna be with them for my entire life. 

(JENNIE) Weve spent more time together than with our own families, so were like real sisters in our everyday lives. I feel as if were close friends who became one team, rather than were bound as a team by somebody else.

(LISA) Every one of our team has different strengths, so we talk about good things about each other. 

(ROS) As the four of us are all different, we make up for the others weaknesses, while trusting and recognizing each other as well. 

- You got this AAA rookie award thanks to fans great support. What do you want to say to fans?

(JISOO) Im really grateful that weve been loved so much even though its been only a few months since our debut. Well continue to show you better performances, so please keep your interest in us. Love you!

(JENNIE) From the days of training, Ive always been concerned about whether we will be able to actually make debut and be loved by people to receive a rookie award. Now, my dream has come true, so Im so happy and grateful. I really thank BLACKPINKs fans who have long waited for us and all the people who listen to our song and love us. Weve never thanked our fans personally yet, but there will be many opportunities for that from now on. So, please look forward to it and please continue to love BLACKPINK. 

(LISA) I really thank those who have supported us since our debut. Im so happy that were receiving this big love and well keep working hard to continuously show you even better BLACKPINK. 

(ROS) Im always so grateful for fans and Im sorry that there is no way to better express my gratitude. I just wanna say thank you and I love you for fans who have always been supporting and waiting for us. 

- Whats your goal for the rest of the year 2016?

(JISOO) Its not limited to 2016. I have a lot of things to achieve from now on. I hope for BLACKPINKs growth as an artist. 

(JENNIE) I wanna present good performances that can leave a long-lasting impression in all the people. 

(LISA) I wanna give more performances. 

(ROS) I think there still are people who dont know who BLACKPINK is, as its been only a few months since our debut. I hope more people can know who we are. 

- As what kind of idol group do you want to be remembered by fans?

(JISOO) A team that fans always wait for and look forward to seeing each and every performance

(JENNIE) I hope BLACKPINK will be a group who is always worth listening to and who is loved by fans any time with any song.

(LISA) I hope BLACKPINK will be a group that fans can always look forward to. 

(ROS) I wish BLACKPINK could make each and every performance impressive. I wanna be an artist whom fans always wait for and look forward to seeing. 

- What is plan from now on?

(JISOO) Well keep presenting diverse and good performances. Please keep your interest in us. 

(JENNIE) Well show diverse performances on the stage. 

(LISA) Well show diverse performances on the stage.

(ROS) Well always work hard to grow as an artist and constantly show you a new BLACKPINK.

Often testimonies of their 'friends' from the same school are questionable to disturbing, plaguing the idols for years. 

However, in the case of Jisoo of Black Pink, testimonies from her friends online are making fans fall in love with the idol even more! 

Here are some of the stories from Jisoo's pre-debut days: 

""I went to the same middle school as [Jisoo], and she was pretty but became even prettier. Her older sister also looks like Han Hyo Joo. [Jisoo] was really nice!! When kids like these become successful, it feels great."" 

""Jisoo was nice. We were in the same class. Not really close, but she was good-natured, nice, and pretty. She did fall asleep a lot in class though lol (I saw her drool often). She was kind and had good relationships with classmates. She had a wide spectrum of friends, everyone from ones who sits and reads books to kinda 'those' kids. [Jisoo] was bright and funny. Her image is girly, but she's actually like a puppy. She smiles like a puppy, too."" 

""I went to the same middle school as Kim Jisoo and even then, she had huge eyes and was so pretty. She's prettier now...Her older sister is super pretty, too."" 

""How was her personality?"" 

""She was nice! When I first went to middle school, I didn't know anyone in my class, but she was in the class next door!! There was a person I didn't get along with, and Jisoo was friends with her. And the friend wanted everyone to talk badly about me and hate me, but when we had classes together, Jisoo would talk to me first. It was the first year of middle school, so we were all sensitive, so it was me who was more careful about talking to her.""
