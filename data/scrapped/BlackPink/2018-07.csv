&gt;BLACKPINK's latest chart accomplishments bring additional accolades that indicates the girl group is on its way to being one of K-pop's brightest acts in America.

&gt;With the success of new single ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" -- which makes history with a debut on the Hot 100 chart -- the group also match records set by some of the music scene's biggest successes. As ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" debuts at No. 1 on the World Digital Song Sales chart, the quartet now join PSY and BIGBANG as the K-pop act with the second-most No. 1s on the tally. BTS only has more with eight at the moment.
&gt;What's notable about the accomplishment is that BLACKPINK has done this in record time compared to the other act's debuts, with the ladies going four for four by snagging No. 1s on the chart for every new release so far, including their debut single.
&gt;See a breakdown of the K-pop acts with multiple No. 1s on World Digital Song Sales below.

&gt;K-Pop Acts With the Most No. 1s on World Digital Song Sales:
BTS - 8
PSY, BIGBANG and Blackpink - 4
EXO and 2NE1 - 2

&gt;Also notable is how BLACKPINK's Square Up EP is No. 1 on the World Albums chart, which means Jennie, Jisoo, Ros and Lisa own the top slot on both of Billboard's main World charts. With No. 1s on both the World Albums and World Digital Song Sales chart, BLACKPINK score an accomplishment only three other K-pop acts have managed, including only one other girl group. To date, only BTS, TWICE and J-Hope have earned No. 1s on both World charts among K-pop acts. 

&gt;The following weeks -- and follow-up releases -- will see if BLACKPINK can surpass their seniors, but at the moment they're sitting pretty (""and nasty"") among some of K-pop's most accomplished.

The foursome recently spoke to Billboard about their new release and what fans can hope to see from them in the future.

&gt;Regarding their newest EP, Ros says that BLACKPINK is, ""Going for a much more stronger look. And I think that's portrayed mostly in the music video. We tried to pull off some looks that we, that we wouldn't have even imagined coming out with previously.""

&gt;The music video for Ddu-Du Ddu-Du was one of the most extravagant ones the quartet has put out to date and explored a variety of themes as the foursome sang about their prowess, and was heavily focused on dancing, including a fierce finger-shooting move. ""As far as the choreography goes, we had a little dance break at the end, which we've never done before, explains Jennie. So we put a lot of effort into it, and we're so happy everybody's enjoying it.""

&gt;Each member was featured in her own distinct sets, and Ji Soo explains that there was a deeper meaning to her scenes, where she represents celebrity culture in this day and age. ""I'm wearing a pink wig, standing in front of a huge photo of me on the wall, she says. The message is about how people can go crazy about the celebrity figures and how they will aim at the celebrities if they make mistakes. We wanted to portray a scene which is interesting and meaningful to us.

&gt;The foursome also tell Billboard which song on the four-track EP correlates to which member: Ros likes ""See U Later"" and its sassiness, Jennie prefers ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" because ""It's good to be back rapping. Meanwhile, Lisa relates to ""Forever Young"" because it reflects the group being 20-somethings, while Ji Soo choses ""Really"" because she likes the ""Cute vibe.""

&gt;The women also discussed which outfits they'd want to take from the set, a bit more regarding the album, and what they hope to achieve in the future. ""We would love to have any opportunities as we can to perform in front of you guys, not just in Korea but maybe one day in front of everyone around the world, says Jennie. I feel like we'll just keep going on with what we're doing right now.""

&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK confirmed to hold an extra concert in Japans Kyocera Dome Osaka on December 24, as part of the BLACKPINK ARENA TOUR 2018. In 23 months since making debut, BLACKPINK will become the first foreign girl group in Japan to hold a concert in Kyocera Dome Osaka.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prior to the concert in Kyocera Dome, BLACKPINK will hold a total of 7 concerts in 3 cities including their performance at Osaka-jo Hall from July 24\~25, Fukuoka International Congress Center from August 16\~17, and at Makuhari Messe from August 24\~28. They are expected to meet their fans in Japan from this Summer until the end of the year through the arena tour.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINKs popularity in Japan was hot from the beginning. The group fascinated local fans by running a large-scale debut showcase in Budokan, last year on July. They not only sold out 14,000 tickets, but also had approximately 200,000 people entered for tickets. Their debut album topped Oricons Weekly Album Rankings, proving the high interest and explosive response of Japanese fans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their first-ever mini album SQUARE UP released last month on the 15th also won the honor of topping Japans iTunes Album Chart and Oricons Digital Album Chart. Due to popular demand, BLACKPINK will release an album in Japan on August 22, which contains a Japanese version of their title song DDU-DU DDU-DU.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK established themselves as a global girl group with their album SQUARE UP. The set milestones as a K-Pop girl group by debuting at Billboards main charts including the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 as no. 40 and no. 55, respectively. Foreign press including the economy journal Forbes, also highlighted BLACKPINKs global success. In Korea, the group is maintaining their no. 1 spot in major music charts for 22 days.

The young girl group's runaway success hints at a larger message.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK debuted on the K-pop scene in 2016 with a subtle but clear declaration.""BLACKPINK in your area"" was coolly slurred by member Jennie over zippy synthesizers at the top of their debut ""Boombayah"" video. The double-single release of""Boombayah"" and the smooth pop cut ""Whistle"" solidified the long-awaited girl group as an instant success in their home country -- with the latter track hitting No. 1 on the Korean charts -- as well as pulling off an unprecedented feat in America: The quartet was the first K-pop act to send their debut single to No. 1 on *Billboard*'s World Digital Song Sales chart. With just six singles and one EP to their name, BLACKPINK are breaking major ground for K-pop girl groups -- and girl groups at large -- with a certified hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, a top 40 album on the Billboard 200 and the most-viewed Korean video in its first 24 hours on YouTube.And the key may be chalked up to their loud-and-proud embracingof their identity as a girl group.  
&gt;  
&gt;From the get-go, BLACKPINK branded themselveswith catchy self-shout-outs. There's Jisoo's ""Black to the Pink"" hook on ""Boombayah,"" Lisa's ""A little bit of Black with a little bit of Pink"" line on their ""So Hot"" remix and multiple shouts of their name on ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" and throughout their just-released *Square Up* EP. The groupitself was designed to showcase the duality between the group's dark and fierce side (the black) along with their light and lovable side (pink), felt in their extremely accessible hip-hop/dance-pop sound. The ladies themselves fit the image with rappers Jennie and Lisa blending nicely with vocalists Ros and Jisoo. Furthermore, BLACKPINK embrace the fact that they arean all-female act with lines like ""We the only gang to run the game in high-heels"" on ""So Hot.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The blatant, proud declaration ofgirl poweris reminiscent to some of the most successful girl groups of recent years who always seemed fully invested in the group identity. Starting in the late '90s, the Spice Girls had their five different spices, with each girl having a polished image and performance style. Plus, their two smash albums, *Spice* and *Spice World,* all played off their name, not to mention the lead singles from both introduced the different members (see Mel B and Geri Halliwell's rap on *Spice*'s ""Wannabe"") or became agroup anthem(*Spice World*'s ""Spice Up Your Life"").  
&gt;  
&gt;TLC had their T-Boz, Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopez and Chili with each member's part instantly identifiable in a song. Destiny's Child may have been ultimatelyoverpowered by Beyonc, but the group's story was one of pop's most well-known with the ladies putting their story into music (the group'smember exitswere addressed on ""Survivor"") and eventually began shouting out the different members (""Kelly, can you handle this? Michelle, can you handle this?""), making a reunion performance like Coachella 2018 all the more welcome. The Pussycat Dolls committed to their theme and had clear branding in their look, merchandise andsongs; look back to verses from collaborators like BustaRhymes, Missy Elliott and Snoop Dogg.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, the most successful wave ofWestern girl groups of recent years did not use those same tactics. The two obviousfront-runners,Fifth Harmonyand Little Mix, typically do not publicly pushthe fact that it's a group singing their insanely catchy singles on the record, with the collective identity feeling more like a backdrop. While tracks like ""Wings,"" ""DNA"" or ""Salute"" touched and alluded totheir personal story as a group (member Leigh-Anne Pinnockhas a ""Wings""-inspired butterfly tattoo), it was only recently that the LMladies seemed to lettheir narrative -- or the public's perceived narrative -- directly creep into the music with ""Shout Out to My Ex,"" an apparent kiss-off anthem to the media's obsession with Perrie Edwards and her ex-fianc Zayn Malik. That single was voted British single of the year at the 2017 Brit Awards, yetBLACKPINK was able to send their latest single ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" to No. 55 on the Hot 100, out-peakingany release from Little Mix to date though LM has four albums that have charted higher than BP's *Square Up*.  
&gt;  
&gt;It also feels like some of K-pop's biggest and most globally successful girl groups have their team branding in mind too, as seenin now-disbanded acts like 2NE1and 4Minute.But also look at groups likeTWICE crafting hooks around their names (their debut single ""Like Ooh Ahh"" included the ""I aint no easy/ Better think about it twice"" bridge), while Red Velvet have done a nice job by embracing both sides of their name with bright pop and slick R&amp;B tracks, andPristin opened their debut single chanting ""We are Pristin!"" All three of those groups, along with BLACKPINK, scored impressive debuts with their first releases on the *Billboard* charts.  
&gt;  
&gt;All in all, it feels like BLACKPINK may be hitting on a larger sentiment when it comes to their girl-group identity and clear pride as a girl group. There's an excitement in any group owning their identity, but BLACKPINK is doing it in a way that feels like the listener is joining in on the hype and helping craft this story. Four women coming together to declare""BLACKPINK is the revolution,"" heard on the new track""Forever Young,"" is powerful -- it's not one person changing things; it's BLACKPINK.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moving forward, it seems like it would only help the quartet to put more of themselves into the music. There are topics the group could address that could fit to their personal story, perhaps their frustrations or worries for their long-awaited debut that was teased for years, pressures of the industry or maybe the worriesthey feel as potential global stars. But BLACKPINK's runaway success does not seem to be a fluke and touching on something larger than just uber-catchy hits -- there's a power in them being confident and proud of their power as a girl group in a way that only the best, and most global, girl groups can.

&gt;This means BLACKPINK now holds the record for the fastest K-pop group music video to reach this milestone, beating BTSs previous record of 24 days and two hours with Fake Love.

&gt;BLACKPINKs DDU-DU DDU-DU has consistently broken records of being the fastest girl group MV to reach milestones on Youtube. It was also confirmed to have garnered the second most amount of views ever on a music video in YouTube history, which means it also recorded the highest official number of views in 24 hours ever for a K-pop MV.

Maybe it's just me, but I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the styling this comeback. The MV I liked for the most part, but for the lives I'm a bit disappointed. Some of the outfits just seem messy and disjointed, like yesterday's Music Core, with Jisoo's mangled sweatshirt and Lisa's recycled pants from Idol Room. And I'm not in love with the color-coordinated outfits either, as part of what I loved about BP's styling previously was that they didn't need to rely on gg fashion tropes to look cohesive; the all-pink and all-white clothes, while not terrible by any means, just didn't look creative.

I know a previous criticism of CKW was her grandma dresses and floral patterns, but while she had her misses, I personally liked the touch of femininity especially since it was a large distinction from both 2NE1's styling and any other K-pop group. But Ji-Eun's styling is a huge mess both in the past and present. I know that Ikonics were ecstatic when they got a new stylist for Love Scenario, and even as a nonfan I could tell their fashion improved dramatically. Right now, I just feel like BP is lacking the refinement and sophistication that made their style famous.

So, does anyone agree or disagree? Am I alone in not liking DDDD's styling? Would love to hear your thoughts on this!",8,14

&gt;  
&gt;As they prove their nickname the view count fairies which was received by surpassing 100 million views for all MVs released since debut, BLACKPINK set another milestone with their new MV.   
&gt;  
&gt;The MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU reached 150 million views in 21 days and 7 hours, setting the fastest record among all K-Pop boy and girl groups. They shortened the previous record by 3 days.

&gt;  
&gt;*According to YG Entertainment, BLACKPINK will wrap up their promotional activities related to the title song DDU-DU DDU-DU this week, and will extend their activities with the sub-title song, FOREVER YOUNG. After receiving a lot of love and support from the fans after making comeback in 1 year, BLACKPINK will repay the fans by extending their promotional period.*

&gt;  
&gt;As Inkigayo places a song that reached no. 1 for 3 consecutive weeks into the hall of fame and removes it from the chart, people are wondering whether BLACKPINK will win the crown once again with the song FOREVER YOUNG following their success with DDU-DU DDU-DU.  
&gt;  
&gt;Along with their great performances in music broadcasts, BLACKPINK is also achieving great success in music charts.  
&gt;  
&gt;DDU-DU DDU-DU was placed at no. 1 on major Korean music platforms as of July 9, maintaining their top position for 25 days. SQUARE UP and DDU-DU DDU-DU previously set a milestone in K-Pop girl group history by debuting on Billboards main charts including the Billboard 200 as no. 40 and Hot 100 as no. 55.  
&gt;  
&gt;The MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU became the 2nd most watched MV in 24 hours since its release in the world, while becoming the fastest MV in K-Pop history to reach 150 million views, in 21 days and 7 hours since its release.

They're one of this generations most-followed acts, with hit after hit, and the recent release of their single DDU-DU DDU-DU in June led to the group [making history](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8462635/blackpink-k-pop-history-hot-100-billboard-200) on the *Billboard* charts.

As they grow more prominent internationally, here are a few introductory facts to know about *the revolution that is BLACKPINK*:

**1. Theyre the best-charting female Korean act ever**

Since they dropped their first two songs[Boombayah and Whistle](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7476115/blackpink-debut-boombaya-whistle-world-digital-songs-chart) on Aug. 8 two years ago, BLACKPINK has rapidly become one of the most popular girl groups of this generation, thanks to their charming swagger and dynamic songs. Their most recent single, Ddu-Du Ddu-Du, made history last month when it debuted at No. 55 on the Billboard Hot 100, dated June 30; it was the first time since 2009 that a Korean girl group has appeared on the chart and the first time any female Korean artist ranked with a predominantly non-English song.

They also are the highest-charting female Korean act on the [Billboard 200](https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200), where *Square Up* recently debuted at No. 40.

**2. They have only nine songs**

As popular as they are, its hard to believe that BLACKPINK hasnt even released 10 original songs yet. But its a matter of quality over quantity when it comes to this quartet, with their bright, bombastic electronic dance-meets-hip-pop sound -- plus a look at their softer side on the folk-pop ballad [Stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzVR_fymZw4) -- and their captivating performances drawing in fans.

**3. Four members, four flavors**

Living up to their name, theres a bit of a powerful edge to the quartets girlishness with each of the four -- Jennie, Ji Soo, Lisa and Ros -- bringing something to the team. All of them sing, but Jennie and Lisa also serve as sharp-hitting rappers, while Ros and Ji Soo offer more feminine tones. The group's members are allimmensely stylish and have served as models for numerous high-end fashion brands, with each of the women bringing her own distinct vibe to the mix.

**4. Both Jennie and Ros are fluent in English**

Ros is Australian and Jennie studied in New Zealand for several years, so the girl group has a bit of an edge on the international K-pop scene because both of them are able to communicate directly with English-speaking fans. Thai member Lisa also speaks some English along with her native Thai and Korean.

**5. BLACKPINK is from a Big 3 K-pop label**

Hailing from YG Entertainment, BLACKPINK is the companys first girl group since they revealed 2NE1 in 2009. Theyre lablemates with the likes of BIGBANG, CL, Winner, iKON, Epik Highand and, until recently, Psy.

**6. Theres a sense of duality within the group**

The name BLACKPINK is representative of the acts desire to surpass the typical perceptions of pink by reclaiming the color and turning it into a symbol for what they stand for: fiercely beautiful women who overflow with talent and set their eyes on dominating the industry.

**7. Blink and fall in love with BLACKPINK.**

The girl groups fans are known as Blinks, a combination of both parts of their name: BLackpINK. Theyre extremely dedicated to the group and are so populous that BLACKPINKs most recent music video, for the song DDU-DU DDU-DU was viewed so many times within the first 24 hours upon its release that [it made history](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8464130/blackpink-youtube-record-ddu-du-ddu-du-video).

**8. They havetheir own television show**

New Blinks looking to get closer with the act can cozy up and spend some time living in the [*BLACKPINK House*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBdQnhwO4gQ&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLNF8K9Ddz0kJWl_ftRAo0aNJCSZlQVkRd), a short reality series starring the foursome. A total of 11 episodes have been released, and a 12th is expected in the future.

**9. The music video for their latest single Ddu-Du Ddu-Du contains some social commentary**

In their recent [interview](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8463862/blackpink-square-up-ddu-du-ddu-du-video-interview) with *Billboard*, Ji Soo addressed how her scenes in Ddu-Du Ddu-Du reflected the life of celebrities, where all eyes are on them and want them to be perfect but then pounce the moment something goes wrong.

**10. They recently returned with their** ***Square Up*** **EP**

After a variety of single albums and one Japanese EP, BLACKPINK released their first Korean EP on June 18, revealing not only DDU-DU DDU-DU but three other tracks: Forever Young, Really and See U Later. All of the songs on *Square Up*were written by YG Entertainments in-house producer Teddy Park in collaboration with various songwriters. Itis currently the highest-charting album by a Korean girl group ever.

I would add all the points up and then release the results if enough people participate. Thanks for reading, this is just meant as a fun little thing, so please don't downvote anyone for their opinion/list.

296,2018-7-13,2018,7,13,17,8yi47v,"Whenever I see comments like ""Rose/Jisoo is underappreciated or Jisoo has too little lines""",https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/8yi47v/whenever_i_see_comments_like_rosejisoo_is/,9epiphany8,1531469058,"I've been wanting to talk about this for a while, so here it is.  
Remember, All four members of BP are talented AF -- they all had to audition and then get through trainee days to get to this point. Rose and Lisa ranked number #1 in their respective country's audition (As i'm sure many BLINKs have researched themselves)

Why can't we appreciate all of them as a whole and understand that j*ust because people will have 'biases', does NOT mean they underappreciate the people they don't 'bias'?*   
Even if it isn't explicit, 99&amp;#37; who enjoy blackpink really do appreciate/think highly of every single one of the members. YOU ARE ONLY AS STRONG AS YOUR WEAKEST LINK. If it was the case that certain members of BP were not as talented/great as the other, I don't think Blackpink would be so popular/famous right now. Their collective prowess is a key factor to their current success.

But Why does it seem to some people that some members aren't getting recognized as others? Or why does it seem Jisoo has less lines? I'll break it down to you this way: It boils down to some psychology.

First, everyone obviously notices the rapping more because it's something Girl groups don't often do these days. So when you Lisa, who has ridiculous flow and has a great voice for rapping, and Jennie - who's also amazing at it, this psychologically diminishes the singing parts - which Jisoo and Rose specialize in - to some people.  

Regarding Rose; Again, I think most fans who've actually listened to multiple of BP's songs realize how blissfully mellow her voice is. It's something we all are 100&amp;#37; inherently are aware of and again, people are **more likely at first** to point out a girl's rapping flow and swag than her beautiful voice. It's current society's psychology - a girl rapper is not seen as common as a girl singer. 

Regarding Jisoo; There's a lot to write but I'll keep it short as possible. Even in the vocals, you have to split time with none other than Rose. Psychologically, people see her as the poster ""pretty girl"". (Even as a trainee, it was clear). Psychologically, especially in the first few songs like Boombayah or Whistle she's had more typical ""girly"" lines and may seem less exciting than rapping. But Just because Lisa is the best dancer, or Jennie can rap better than Jisoo, or Rose has an amazing voice does **NOT** mean Jisoo can't dance or sing well. And on top of that, Jisoo has also gotten better at her dancing stage presence over the past two years, which is the only thing I could probably nitpick when I first saw the dance practice videos. DDDD especially has clearly given relatively equal time and lines to all the members.   
And Psychologically again, Lisa Jennie and Rose all have more foreign appeal because they've spent a lot of their lives outside Korea and are fluent /near fluent in English. Or when a foreigner sees blonde hair they sometimes immediately are more interested. It is a familiarity cognitive bias. 

Without taking a step back, some people will have initial one-sided attention/love toward only a/a few specific group member(s). But it does not mean they dislike/don't appreciate the other members.

**So yes, there are psychological factors playing in, but just know that objectively, they are all freaking amazing, as a team AND individually. Don't let other people's explicit/impulse comments stray you from this objective truth that everyone ends up actually realizing and internally cementing it.**

&gt;  
&gt;When the panel celebrated Jisoos appearance, she showed that she was brimming with confidence with her self-introduction, Im already the ace, Jisoo. MC Jun Hyun Moo asked if it was true that she had approached the production staff first about a guest appearance and Jisoo replied, Icame out here to be the ace. Yoo Se Yoon said that he was thinking about leaving the show and Im eyeing that spot.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the team selections were done, Jisoo shared that she had wanted to be on the same team with SEVENTEENs Seungkwan, which unfortunately did not end up happening. Instead, Jisoo was on Lee Soo Geuns team with Heo Kyung Hwan and Yoo Se Yoon.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first quiz was an emoticon quiz and Eun Ji Won commented, Ive never seen anyone do really well who say beforehand that theyre going to do well. Jisoo replied, Youre going to see that person in me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although Seungkwan answered the first question with his fast reflexes, Jisoo was quickly able to answer others, including her own song Play With Fire. The two idols stayed head-to-head until Jisoo took the lead with a question about BLACKPINKs latest song DDU-DU DDU-DU.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jun Hyun Moos team then took the lead in the subsequent quizzes to win the show, but Jisoo was unanimously voted the MVP of the episode by the entire cast.

I've searched and haven't found any dates. It's been a solid month since the DDU-DU MV came out. There aren't even live performances of Really and See u Later that I could find.

Secondly, is there anywhere to see the line distribution? I swear Ros got robbed on this one. As great as the mini-album is I feel like she got very few lines on every song but DDU-DU after all the rapping + giving Jisoo some more vocals and giving Lisa some vocals as well along with the rapping.
Specially in See u Later it looks like Ros got two lines or so.",11,10

&gt;  
&gt;On the July 15 episode, the cast and guests paired off to compete in a couple race for the shows summer special.The couples were Hwang Chi Yeol and Song Ji Hyo, Han Eun Jung and Yoo Jae Suk, Bora and Ji Suk Jin, Pyo Ye Jin and Yang Se Chan, Jennie and Lee Kwang Soo, and BLACKPINKs Jisoo and Kim Jong Kook.  
&gt;  
&gt;For one of the races challenges, eachperson had a cup of water attached to theirhelmet. The couples then had to go through either a horror room or mirror room, and the couple who had the most water left in their cups at the end of the challenge would be the winning team.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it was Jennie and Lee Kwang Soos turn to choose between the horror room and mirror room, Jennie chose the horror room after hearing HaHa say, The horror room isnt scary at all, and you can get out quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the entrance, she confidently told Lee Kwang Soo, Ill take the lead, but began to cry as soon as she entered the room.  
&gt;  
&gt;While sobbing, she said, I think theres someone here. I think theyre going to surprise me. Lee Kwang Soo was startled by her tears and told her, Ill go first.He then shed his scaredy-cat image to lead her through the room.  
&gt;  
&gt;When they finally made it out of the horror room, Lee Kwang Soo threw the remaining water in his cupat the staff and yelled at them for making Jennie cry. Jennie protested, They said downstairs that there wasnt anything that was going to scare me.  
&gt;  
&gt;The staff told the couple that they had lost, to which Jennie replied, I know. Lee Kwang Soo added, I gave up from the beginning. I didnt know that Jennie would be like this. She was sobbing as soon as she went in.  
&gt;  
&gt;The couple then reunited with the rest of the cast, and Jennie once again shed some tears. Lee Kwang Soo commented, Shes the biggest scaredy-cat out of everyone I know. The cast members asked if she was okay, and Jennie pointed at HaHa and repeated that he had told her that the room wasnt scary.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the cast members yelled at HaHa for lying, he got up and said, But isnt she so cute? I cant believe I made this happen.You should buy me a meal.

No. 1 on Daily Charts For 30 Consecutive Days!,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/8z7q5q/blackpink_sets_another_milestone_no_1_on_daily/,BrrrrRAMBO,1531712910,"&gt;BLACKPINK, the new record generators, set another milestone.   
&gt;  
&gt;As of today (15th) at 2:30 PM, the title song DDU-DU DDU-DU from BLACKPINKs first mini album SQUARE UP kept its no. 1 spot in the daily chart of Melon, which is Koreas largest music streaming platform. The group maintained their top position from June 15 when they first released their album, for a total of 30 consecutive days.   
&gt;  
&gt;It is unprecedented for a K-Pop artist to maintain their no. 1 spot in Melons daily chart for 30 consecutive days since its release, after the chart reformation that happened last year on February. Most releases often failed to maintain their no. 1 position on daily charts, despite topping real-time charts that update streams and downloads on an hourly basis. However, BLACKPINK is still marching at the top as if they just released a new song, although it has been a month since the album was released.  
&gt;  
&gt;After dominating major music platforms, BLACKPINK started their extended promotional activities with the song FOREVER YOUNG on SBS Inkigayo, which aired today. The heated popularity of DDU-DU DDU-DU which led to a triple crown is now being passed on to FOREVER YOUNG.   
&gt;  
&gt;The song FOREVER YOUNG is a dance track in Moombahton rhythm. The songs beautiful verse and its contrasting charismatic chorus grabs the listeners attention.   
&gt;  
&gt;The lyrics contain the positive message of lets spend our youth without regret. The bright and light choreography in the beginning and the charismatic moves in the end balances well with each other, and is great enough to capture the hearts of fans.   
&gt;  
&gt;After presenting explosive stage manners through a music broadcast, members JENNIE and JISOO will appear on the summer special couple race episode of SBS Running Man today, at 4:50 PM. BLACKPINKs unexpected charms and variety senses will make the viewers forget about the sweltering heat of the summer.

&gt;  
&gt;On SBS Good Sunday-Running Man aired on the 15th, JENNIE performed a custom dance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unlike her charismatic image she displays on stage, she revealed her cute and sloppy charms. Her bright and innocent charms captured the hearts of not only members from Running Man, but also the viewers.  
&gt;  
&gt;JENNIE selected the bag herself after becoming partners with Lee Gwangsoo. However, the bag had a bomb, making Lee Gwangsoo grumble while stating, I picked another one, and you gave me this bag. JENNIE explained, Well have another opportunity to change it. Isnt it our advantage to have the bomb in the beginning and Lee Gwangsoo replied, What are you talking about, making the viewers laugh.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first mission to exchange bags was a clash of talents. JENNIE displayed extreme aegyo during the Aegyo Acrostic Poem challenge, and took the no. 1 spot. On the following challenge, JENNIE chose the horror room and stated, Ill go first to win, leading the team while telling her partner that shes not afraid.  
&gt;  
&gt;But that did not last long. JENNIE was surprised as soon as she went inside and shed tears, making the people laugh. JENNIE was too scared that Lee Gwangsoo, known as the official coward of Running Man, had to soothe JENNIE. JENNIE stated, They said they wont surprise us, while shedding tears.  
&gt;  
&gt;After bringing JENNIE outside, Lee Gwangsoo admitted, Shes the most scaredy-cat Ive seen in my life. He continued, She started wailing as soon as she got in. She speaks in familiar form to me now and imitated JENNIE scared inside the horror room, making the people burst into laughter.  
&gt;  
&gt;JENNIEs losing hand continued during the final race. When the members stated, JENNIE is also a losing hand, JENNIE put the blame and Lee Gwangsoo by replying, His soul is affecting me. JENNIE took the name tags of Yang Sechan and Pyo Yejin, but took another bomb. With the death match ahead, JENNIE told Lee Gwangsoo that Im sure we wont receive the last penalty, but lost the rock-paper-scissors game.  
&gt;  
&gt;The final selection result was also a bomb. The members invited her to the losing hand club while stating, JENNIE herself is a losing hand.

Right now they are up for preorder, but I live in the US and they are sold on Japan only websites. I never preorder from Japan before, so I was wondering if someone with more experience knows any ways I can preorder them?

Also, I know that on YGEX's official store preorder benefits include message cards and a sticker (at least that's what google translated the text into). And on HMV it said there will be a set of postcards as preorder benefits. I was wondering if anyone knows If the message cards are different from HMV's postcards? 

I want to get the CD+DVD set and the Jennie version CD. If anyone knows what sites I can preorder off of (that allows for US addresses) that gives preorder benefits I would greatly appreciate it. 
(Ideally I would want to order the CD+DVD off of YGEX for the message cards and the Jennie Version off of HMV for the postcards.)

PS: As the info I got was google translated, if any clarifications or corrections can be made about the preorder benefits. Please let me know.",13,15

&gt;Each of the BLACKPINK members graced her own individual cover of the magazines August issue, showcasing the four idols unique charms and styles. Jennie contrasted a daring black bustier with classic pearl jewelry, while Jisoo tapped into her inner goddess in a vibrant blue dress. Lisa rocked a diverse mix of textures and fabrics for an unpredictable yet elegant look, and Ros added a modern edge to her romantically old-fashioned velvet dress with a pair of striking cutout boots.

&gt;After the photo shoot, BLACKPINK sat down to talk about their recent success on the charts with their latest hit DDU-DU DDU-DU. The members reported being surprised and thrilled by the publics reaction, explaining, It was our first comeback in a year, and we felt even more honored [by the songs success] because we werent thinking about chart rankings while preparing. We worried a lot because our concept this time was fiercer than before, so we were really happy that people liked it.

&gt;They added, It also gave us the courage to think, Lets try something new next time as well.'

&gt;BLACKPINK went on to reveal the little things that make them happy on a day-to-day basis. Lisa replied, Talking with my mom on the phone everyday! Seeing me work hard makes her happy, and seeing that gives me strength.

&gt;Ros shared, I search for music I like or interviews by artists I like on YouTube. I think watching those videos has a healing effect.

&gt;Jisoo revealed that she enjoys reading in her spare time. I feel a small joy when I read books, she said. Right now, Im reading Trapeze by Hideo Okuda.

&gt;Finally, Jennie reported, My favorite thing to do is spend time with my dogs at the dorm.

Was Originally Given To BLACKPINK + His Affection For The Group",https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/90k153/seungri_talks_about_how_1_2_3_was_originally/,BrrrrRAMBO,1532122539,"&gt;In a recent Naver V Live broadcast, Seungri talked about his friendship with the BLACKPINK members, his music, and more.  
&gt;  
&gt;On July 20 at 5 p.m. KST, Seungri spent the hour before the release of his first solo album, communicating with his fans through a live show, Hello, This Is Seungri Season 2 (literal translation).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He began the session by saying, This is BIGBANGs Seungri, who has returned with a solo for the first time in five years. The idol shared how he came to release an album despite the fact he didnt have any plans for solo promotions, and talked about how the other BIGBANG members had encouraged him.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Seungri also talked about how his title track 1, 2, 3! hadnt originally been meant for him. He explained, When I first heard 1, 2, 3! I found out that BLACKPINKs Ros had already recorded for it. It was originally BLACKPINKs. But people thought that it would fit better with a guy, so I sang 1, 2, 3! and it came out well. Thats how the song came to be. He added, It was originally a song that had a very scary and awesome vibe to it. But I added my own refreshing energy and feel to it, so it became a more energetic and confident song.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While on the topic of BLACKPINK, Seungri then shared that he enjoyed listening to the groups Forever Young these days. Seungri commented, I like the lyrics, Forever Young. Thank you to BLACKPINK for creating a great song. He talked about his affection for the group and continued, I told BLACKPINK, I want to be friends with you guys. They really are good to me and really treat me like a friend. Its great. I want to join BLACKPINK as their fifth member.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Seungri talked more about his music as well. He shared, I participated in all the songs in this album. I worked hard to show my sincerity. Ive promoted as BIGBANG for more than 10 years. I put in a lot of effort to make music that is more mature and experienced. People will probably be surprised that I have this kind of musical talent.

I chose this playlist because I want to experience more of this group. Not BTS, not GOT7. 

I. Want. BlackPink.

&gt;  
&gt;During the July 22 episode of SBSs My Ugly Duckling, Seungri was eating in the YG Entertainment cafeteria by himself when the members of BLACKPINK approached him to share their meal together.  
&gt;  
&gt;The atmosphere surrounding the members of BLACKPINK was light and full of laughter, and Seungri remarked, You guys seem to be really happy around each other. Youre about 1.5 years into your debut, right? Those are good times. I suddenly miss the other \[BIGBANG\] members.  
&gt;  
&gt;Seungri captured the attention of the BLACKPINK members when he offered to share some of the wisdom hes picked up in his years as a public figure. First, he opened up about how to deal with scandals. He said, If you wake up one morning and you have hundreds of text messages on your fun, that means a scandal has happened. When that happens, dont start reading the texts right away, take a drink of water before you start.  
&gt;  
&gt;He also added the importance of breathing in and out after every text message. He explained that the more messages you read, the drier your throat gets and you may hold your breath. Seungri shared relatable advice through his own personal experiences in a fun and lighthearted way that had the BLACKPINK members laughing along.  
&gt;  
&gt;Seungri said, Sometimes, you might want to talk to a boy, and thats okay. In order to sing about love, you need to have been in love. Then he joked, Just dont get caught. Ive gotten caught for everything, but dont be me.  
&gt;  
&gt;He also shared tips about interacting with Yang Hyun Suk, the founder of YG Entertainment. Seungri said, In the past, Yang Hyun Suk was like a tiger. But after having a kid and starting a family, hes mellowed out a little. He added, Begin your conversation with him with a compliment. He likes it when you say things like, Youve lost so much weight these days!' Seungri also swore BLACKPINK to secrecy as he added, What Yang Hyun Suk likes hearing these days is, Your hair looks so thick these days!'  
&gt;  
&gt;Seungri had the members of BLACKPINK laughing with his quick wit and relatable humor as they enjoyed the rest of their lunch together.

Considering that girl groups usually remain active for 2\~3 weeks, the groups market power is noticeable.  
&gt;  
&gt;The title song DDU-DU DDU-DU from BLACKPINKs first mini album SQUARE UP is currently ranked high in various music charts. The group reached an all-kill status in music charts as soon as they made comeback and are maintaining at the top 3 for over a month. The record is very impressive considering that many popular idols and artists have released a flood of new songs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, the MV for DDU-DU DDU-DU surpassed 210 million views on YouTube as of July 23, setting milestones day by day. On the 19th, the video gathered attention by becoming the fastest MV to reach 200 million views in K-Pop history. This proved BLACKPINKs strong fandom that surpass fandoms for boy groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, JENNIE also topped the girl group member brand reputation rankings released on the 22nd. The rankings were announced by Korea Business Research Institute and were based on 131,479,525 big data collected from June 12 to July 13, analyzing consumer participation, media coverage, communication, and community awareness points.  
&gt;  
&gt;As she proved this fact, JENNIE surprisingly surpassed over 5 million followers on her social media, in a month after she first made her account. Recently, she also became the new variety rookie by displaying various unpredictable charms in SBS Running Man as the losing hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;The album SQUARE UP and its title song DDU-DU DDU-DU also debuted at Billboards main charts including the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 as no. 40 and no. 55 respectively, setting a milestone in K-Pop girl group history. The group also won a total of 11 titles in music broadcasts, proving themselves as the global girl group that represents K-Pop.  
&gt;  
&gt;To thank and repay the fans love and support, BLACKPINK decided to extend their promotional activities with the song FOREVER YOUNG and will release the Japanese version of DDU-DU DDU-DU today (23rd), while continuously communicating with the fans. Some people are expecting that BLACKPINKs influence will continue throughout the year, considering their future schedules including concerts and tours.  
&gt;  
&gt;BLACKPINK is everywhere. From variety shows to communication with fans to their main job as musicians. As they have reached the 2nd month since making comeback, people are wondering what kind of milestones the group will achieve once again, to surprise everyone.

Can someone explain to me how to get tickets for the concert? My girlfriend and I are going to be in Japan and were really excited to hear about their concert. If its not possible I understand but I would really appreciate some help. I dont speak Korean or Japanese and I live in the US if that matters.

Coupled with the Billboard interview where they were asked what's their favorite song from the album and Rose was quick to answer first that See U Later was her favorite these days.

 I know it's non of my business to presume but during that performance I couldn't help but feel the emotions she was conveying. That could just be because she is a fantastic performer but I think it might be something more. 

Seungri did mention to them that in order to sing about love, you have to be in love. Or in this case have been in love.

This post might be just a waste of time and that there really isn't anything there but I just wanted to see if anybody else thought the same.",9,0

I was wondering what apps/services they use to stream? As I would like to watch them consistently as well. 

I only know of V Live. Other than that do they have any other platforms where they live stream? 

Also if anyone happens to know, do they have a lot more streams on v live+ (premium) compared to the free version? Havent had the money lately to get premium but I would like to get it some day, assuming they do stream on it very often.

&gt;According to the director, the team prepared approximately 20 pairs of backup outfits directly on the set of the MV filming. She relayed, ""We began image projects about a month before the MV filming, after receiving word that it would be a song with a 'strong vibe'. We normally have no choice but to wait, since we are a team who needs a fixed title song to be able to dive into the specific work. It took about 2 weeks to purchase the outfits for the MV. When considering outfits for all 4 members, it was a short amount of time, but for YG, it was a longer amount of time than usual. We've often had a much shorter period of time for BIGBANG."" She also added, ""The scene with the powder from Lisa's outfit was created on the spot during the filming. We made sure to prepare so that we could conjure up various combinations on the spot, and our strict preparations paid off."" 

&gt;On BLACKPINK's image transformation for their comeback, the director said, ""We went through numerous fittings in order to confirm the right kind of 'strong' concept that would get rid of their original, pretty image.""

&gt;As the interview continued, the stylist team director gave details on the individual members' outfit concepts. With Jennie's outfit choices, the director shared, ""We chose outfits that would emphasize her cute and pretty, yet chic mask. I also pulled out the 'Vivienne Westwood' 14FW collection check-patterned suit that I've had my eyes on, to give her a slight 1990s feel. When you consider the outfit choices alone, it's not completely girl-crush. The girl-crush image was completed through her attitude in the MV."" 

&gt;For Ros, the stylist team maintained her original, feminine image the most of all the members. ""One of her charms is that she is very feminine and has a lean outline. But depicting femininity with just a dress alone has its limits, so we gave more emphasis on accessories, like hair pieces and dramatic shoes."" 

&gt;Regarding Jisoo's outfit choices, the director explained, ""Many people think of Jisoo as having a calm image, but we get a very stylish and sophisticated vibe from her. I tried giving Jisoo a bit of my own wannabe image. I was happy that Jisoo gave off a newer image in this MV.""

&gt;Finally, the director had only compliments for Lisa's styling. ""She has the best visuals for someone who does fashion styling. She can depict so much visually because of her great proportions. This is why whatever didn't fit with the other members ended up becoming Lisa's. It was difficult to choose because every reference shot we took of her wearing our clothes options ended up being best shots. I'm not exaggerating when I say I was able to style clothing to my heart's content through her.""

680,2018-7-28,2018,7,28,13,92jl6l,Let's discuss Blackpink's line distribution.,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPink/comments/92jl6l/lets_discuss_blackpinks_line_distribution/,Joaoseinha,1532753650,"I raised a question about this here the other day, but I'm interested in hearing how other people feel about Blackpink's line distribution.

Before I get into my own opinion, I wanna state that I don't think Blackpink's distribution is bad in general, specially compared to some other K-pop groups. However, I do think it has some room for improvement.

For the record, here's how they stand:

Jennie - 2 1st place (FY, SUL), 6 2nd place (DDDD, Whistle, PWF, Stay, Really, AIIYL), 1 3rd place (Boombayah).

Highest %: 40.3 (SUL) (!!) 

Lowest %: 23.3 (Boombayah)

Ros - 4 1st place (DDDD, Boombayah, Stay, Really), 5 3rd place (Whistle, PWF, FY, SUL, AIIYL). 

Highest %: 36.6 (Stay)

 Lowest %: 19.7 (Whistle)

Lisa - 3 1st place (Whistle, PWF, AIIYL), 3 2nd place (Boombayah, FY, SUL), 1 3rd place (Really), 2 4th place (Stay).

Highest %: 31.0 (Whistle)

Lowest %: 11.8 (Stay)

Jisoo - 2 3rd place (Stay, DDDD), 8 4th place (DDDD, Boombayah, Whistle, PWF, FY, Really, SUL, AIIYL)

Highest %: 24.9 (DDDD)

Lowest %: 10.4 (FY)

If the group was a 3-Piece, this would be great distribution. However, it's not, and it's clear Jisoo getting the least lines is a big trend. Her highest % in any song is nearly Jennie's lowest %.

It's puzzling, considering she's a lead vocal like Jennie, yet she's consistently 4th while Jennie is 1st or 2nd in every single song except Boombayah. Sure, you can raise the argument that Jennie is the main rapper, but that doesn't explain why she gets so many singing lines in songs where she raps. 

In FY for example, Jennie opens up the song and has many singing lines, while also having part of the chorus AND a rap. Meanwhile most of Lisa's lines come from repeating Whatta bum bum at the end. Before the dance break Jennie is sitting at over 60 seconds of lines while Ros is at 30 and Lisa and Jisoo are at 20.

There are some songs where the line distribution is understandable. In Stay, you expect the main vocalist to have a big chunk and the rapper to not have as much. Once again though, Jennie has the 2nd highest amount of lines over Jisoo and Lisa could have definitely had a few more singing lines. In Whistle you can understand the rappers having more lines.

Boombayah in my opinion was the best distribution, and it went downhill from there.

Brought this up because of Square Up in particular, since in my opinion the line distribution is at its worst so far.

In DDDD, despite having 2 raps Jennie is given part of the chorus. In fact, Jisoo seems to be given credit for DDU sounds before the dance break that don't even sound like her and add something like 10 extra seconds that are honestly irrelevant. Honestly, the chorus should have been entirely split between Jisoo and Lisa, and I think the distribution would have been close to perfect like that.

Mentioned FY's distribution problems above, so moving to Really. I think this song's distribution was actually pretty good. Could have maybe given one of Jennie's lines over to Jisoo, but eh.

Lastly, See U Later's distribution is pretty bad too. Jennie gets one of the first lines, a small rap AND the chorus. Everyone ends up taking part in the chorus in some way except Jisoo, which leaves her with far less lines than everyone else. Giving at least part of the chorus to Jisoo and Ros would have evened things out a lot, instead of the ridiculous 40% of the song that Jennie got. 

Anyway, this turned into a huge rant but I felt like looking a bit deeper into the line distribution. What are everyone's opinions on the distributions overall and in Square Up?",14,0

&gt;The third season of Real Men willmake its comeback alongside theelite 300 warriors of the Korean army.  
&gt;  
&gt;On July 27, a source from MBCs Real Men 300 revealed, Today we signed an MOU (memorandum of understanding) for the Real Men program with the army headquarters in Gyeryongdae and we will begin shooting for the show. Previously, the show confirmedits cast lineup.  
&gt;  
&gt;Real Men 300 will work together with the army headquartersto pick 300 of the finest combatants in hopes to build a strong army.  
&gt;  
&gt;Previously, the army planned to select excellent soldiers from different sectors for the 300 warriors, but Real Men 300 will participate themselves in the selection match from the special forces, Korea Army Academy at Yeongcheon, and the general units to receive the 300 warrior evaluation.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the Real Men 300 members go through the same process of being evaluated as the 300 warriors, those who pass the final test will become honorary 300 warrior soldiers.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is special about the return of Real Men 300 is that viewers will be able to meet soldiers from not only the special forces, but also the Korea Army Academy at Yeongcheon.  
&gt;  
&gt;A source from Real Men 300 stated that in their aspirations to showcase the great image of Koreas army in this new generation, they collaborated with the army headquarters. Some of those who have been confirmed for Real Men 300 are undergoing their own training for the warrior 300 test.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first filming for the cast members of Real Men 300 will begin July 29 atthe Korea Army Academy at Yeongcheon.  
&gt;  
&gt;A source at Real Men 300 commented, Through many peoples interest and support, we have gone through the process of trying to pick the finestsoldiers together with the Korean army. Please show lot of love and support for the really cool members of Real Men.
