I've re-watched Gilmore Girls on and off for the past 5 years. Sometimes it can be a bit much and there have been times where the dialog and egos are too much for me to enjoy, but this past year I've been traveling and homesick and got into it again.

Anyway, so I've been slowly rewatching seasons 2 - 3 for the past weeks, and I suddenly noticed how often Jess's scenes seem to involve the dock on the pond/lake. Now that I've noticed it, I can't unsee it. Jess sometimes seems practically glued to the lake.

I haven't been officially keeping track of these scenes, but I just wanted to list some that come to mind and to see if anyone has noticed similar scenes, and to hear what they mean to you. I get that some of these points are likely a stretch, in terms of tying them all together. All the same, I am finding it interesting to think about.

**Aquatic scenes involving Jess**

* Pushed into the water by Luke
* Rory and Jess sit on the dock during the basket lunch, and Jess picks up Dean's bracelet that she's left behind
* At Sookie's wedding, after Rory and Christopher have been talking and Christopher leaves, the camera pans down and -- surprise -- Jess is standing down a slope next to the shore. Not to be all dramatic, but it's like he's almost comically emerged from the water, some kind of Lady of the Lake. I don't understand where he came from, and I didn't even realize that Rory and Christopher had been standing near water until Jess shows up.
* Jess turns off the sprinklers for Rory when she's watering the neighbors yard, and then turns them back on again for her when she tells him Dean is on his way over to help. (S03, E05: Eight O'Clock at the Oasis)
* After the dance marathon, Jess finds Rory on the bridge, where she tells him she's broken up with Dean and he leaves to go break up with Shane
* Jess allegedly gets ""beaked"" in the eye by a swan (near the lake?)
* Jess brings Luke to paddle around the lake looking for the swan, where Luke tells Jess he needs to start communicating with Rory if he wants to keep dating her
* When Rory's annoyed that Jess hasn't been calling and he shows up after the hockey game, he's got tickets to a band called The Distillers
* When Jess goes to find his dad in California, he spends some time sitting on (what I think is) the Venice Beach Boardwalk

&amp;#x200B;

**Where's the lake??**

It's funny, and maybe I'm just imagining it, but I don't think I've seen any other characters next to the lake. I feel like I didn't even realize that Stars Hollow had a body of water until I kept seeing Jess sitting on the docks, etc. I don't know what the geography of Stars Hollow is like, but it feels to me that often when Jess turns up, suddenly a magical lake appears. I've started assuming it's probably in the park near the gazebo, or something, but I don't really have a grasp on where it's located.

On [this fan-created map](http://web.archive.org/web/20011206014118/http://www.geocities.com/ltlstargg/StarsHollow.html), there's two parks mentioned. Is there a lake in the park near the church? Is that where Sookie got married? And/or is there a lake near the park next to Luke's Diner, and Jess is always hanging out there since it's right next to his home?

On a [Stars Hollow wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_Hollow), there isn't mention of any bodies of water in Stars Hollow (though the page is mostly just a list of establishments). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Symbolism?**

What all of this brings to my mind, is that the dock where Jess hangs out may be some kind of representation of how Jess is trying to work out his emotions in Stars Hollow. Just like a lake is a small version of the ocean, Stars Hollow is supposedly a microcosm of small town New England life. 

From what we know, Jess hasn't known what it is like to have a stable family before he enters the show. All of a sudden he's got Luke in his life: a very steady (read, ""resists change"") father figure. He's also got Lorelei, who from the get-go is (over?) involved and telling Jess how he should feel about Luke. Lorelei involves herself in Jess's life even before Jess arrives, giving Luke unsolicited advice on how to raise a kid. All this is in contrast, obviously, with Jess's absent father and neglectful mother. 

As a disclaimer, I'm possibly projecting too much here, since this is something I've been trying to do in my own life lately (process some mom / dad issues from my childhood). Anyway, bear with me.

From what I can tell, the lake is a place where Jess retreats to sort out what must be a cascade (or blockage) of emotions and feelings about what he's gone through growing up, and to sort out feelings about the present and future. It's where he goes to figure things out about (or together with) Rory. He's really not equipped to have a healthy relationship, and of course Rory isn't equipped to sort out all the problems that Jess is still trying to figure out. Even if Jess  knew how to talk about the childhood trauma he's trying to sort out instead of keeping it all hidden under the surface, Rory couldn't be expected to be his therapist. In any case, they seem to meet at this lake to try to figure it out.

I don't know what the lake specifically could be said to represent. Deepness? Emotional blockage? An oasis after a troubled childhood? Maybe it's just a place where Jess goes to find peace. Maybe water, in general, is symbolic for ""emotions"" in this show. 

Jess gets attacked by a swan, whose medium of travel is this lake. Is this swan-attack representative of self-sabotage?  A wake-up to himself that he needs to figure out his emotional issues if he wants to have healthy relationships in the future? In any case, he lies to Rory about it. He's very embarrassed to have gotten ""beaked"" in the face by a swan, which never really made sense to me. I mean, I never quite understood why this was a plot point in the first place, and I didn't understand why it would be so embarrassing for him to talk about. When I think of it through this scope of Jess the Aquatically Challenged Merman, I can see why he would be pretty embarrassed about getting hurt by unprocessed childhood trauma. It's hard stuff to talk about, and it's especially hard to talk about with someone you're romantically involved with. When you feel like you have someone who loves and supports you, it can feel like a very big risk to share your feelings. If you have been abandoned in the past, it's scary to do something that might ""make waves"". 

This is as far as I've gotten so far on this rewatch, so I'm not sure how this water theme develops. I do remember that Jess goes to California eventually, and faces the Pacific Ocean. What could the ocean represent? I see it either/both as:

* a ""to scale"" version of the Stars Hollow water that Jess has been practicing with. I mean, maybe Jess's issues are larger than a little lake, but because of the gift of staying with Luke, he's had access to a more manageable version of his issues. 
* Jess's dad's version of ""emotional issues,"" which have grown to the size of an ocean because they weren't addressed early on?

I'm not trying to say that a free-spirited guy who is resistant to settling down necessarily has issues... just that the show presents Jess's dad this way, somewhat.

**Other characters and water**

OK, so to balance this out a little, I wanted to include some other water-related moments and themes that I remember from the show, or found mention of today while doing some research about this. These are probably just random, but still interesting.

* Luke loves fishing, and at some point teaches Lorelei how to fish in a kiddie pool in preparation for a date she has (S03E12, Lorelai Out Of Water)
* Rory goes to jail for stealing a yacht with Logan
* For some reason, Dean and the random water cooler in Lorelei's house are inextricably linked in my mind. He's often replacing it for them?
* Lorelai loves snow and loves to smell it before it comes 
* Apparently, the name ""Lorelei"" comes from a story of [a woman sitting on a rock, luring fishermen to their death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorelei_(name)).
* Luke has this boat from his dad, that for a long time he keeps in Lorelai's garage
* &amp;#x200B;

**Slightly unrelated: fire?**

Finally, and probably truly a stretch to go here, but I thought it was interesting that the fire at the inn happened while Rory and Jess were dating. For me, through the scope of Wet Jess, this speaks somewhat to Lorelai's intense dislike of Jess. 

Fire is somewhat of a theme in the episode ""Tales of Poes and Fire,"" which shows the aftermath of the fire of the inn. I just watched it and it's fresh in my mind, and there's a mention of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in there, as well as the gift of the mocha-scented candle that Tobin gives Lorelai. Speaking of Tobin and the candle, there's a thread I found just now saying that maybe [Tobin started the fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/4wlvth/what_caused_the_fire_at_the_independence_inn/). In the episode ""Swan Song"", where Jess originally gets beaked by the swan, Lorelai is apparently wearing a tshirt that advertises fireworks (mentioned in the comments here).

Side note... I've seen on this subreddit that there's sometimes a focus on Team Dean vs Jess vs Logan, which isn't really what I'm looking to touch on here. I think the whole narrative of ""girl chooses between boys"" is a bit overplayed and though it's certainly a \*really\* big part of this show... yeah, not something I'm touching on much in this post. I'm more interested here on the relationship between Jess (and other characters), some kind of water theme, and emotional growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Aquatic scenes involving Jess**

OK so to start off, here are some scenes or moments that involve Jess and an aquatic theme. Like I mentioned before, some of these are likely kind of a stretch, but I thought I'd mention them all the same. I tried to put them in chronological order.

* When Luke is inflating an airbed for Jess before he arrives, - Lorelai tells Luke something like [""Jess needs a bed, not a raft""](https://gilmoregirls.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_%26_Nora/Sid_%26_Nancy) (S02, E05: ""Nick &amp; Nora/Sid &amp; Nancy"")
* The famous ""pushed into the lake"" scene ([quote from fandom](https://gilmoregirls.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_%26_Nora/Sid_%26_Nancy), also S02, E05: ""Nick &amp; Nora/Sid &amp; Nancy"") 

&gt;As Luke and Jess are walking across the bridge, Luke tells Jess that Taylor called and accused Jess of stealing the money from the ""repair the bridge"" donation cup. Jess says that it's not true, and Luke believes him. Luke and Jess exchange some words, and Luke gets frustrated and pushes Jess into the lake.

* Rory and Jess sit on the dock during the basket lunch, and Jess picks up Dean's bracelet that she's left behind (S02, E13: ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"")
* Jess cleans the rain gutters at Lorelai's house (S02, E15: ""Lost and Found""). Later, I think he tells Luke that he's cleaned the rain gutters for all the residents in Stars Hollow while saving up for his car. This occurred to me at the last moment before posting this, and I \*do\* realize it's a stretch that this connects Jess and a reoccurring theme of water. (I really hope no one gets annoyed reading this post, or if it is just too much for someone, they've stopped reading by now...) 
* At Sookie's wedding, after Rory and Christopher have been talking and Christopher leaves, the camera pans down and -- surprise -- Jess is standing down a slope next to the shore. Not to be all dramatic, but it's like he's almost comically emerged from the water, some kind of Lady of the Lake. I don't understand where he came from, and I didn't even realize that Rory and Christopher had been standing near a body of water until Jess shows up. (S02, E22: ""I Can't Get Started"")
* Jess turns off the sprinklers for Rory when she's watering the neighbors yard, and then turns them back on again for her when she tells him Dean is on his way over to help. (S03, E05: ""Eight O'Clock at the Oasis"")
* After the dance marathon, Jess finds Rory on the bridge, where she tells him she's broken up with Dean and he leaves to go break up with Shane (S03, E07: ""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"")
* Jess allegedly gets ""beaked"" in the eye by a swan (near the lake?) (S03, E13: ""Swan Song"")
* Jess brings Luke to paddle around the lake looking for the swan, where Luke tells Jess he needs to start communicating with Rory if he wants to keep dating her (S03, E13: ""Swan Song"")
* When Rory's annoyed that Jess hasn't been calling and he shows up after the hockey game, he's got tickets to a band called The Distillers. (I get that this show has band and other pop culture references every other sentence, and I'm sure there's water-y bands mentioned by other characters.) (S03, E14: ""Face-Off"")
* At some point, Kirk is sitting in the diner not doing anything, and Jess recommends that he reads Moby Dick. (Ditto what I said about the Distillers.)
* When Jess goes to find his dad in California, he spends some time sitting on (what I think is) the Venice Beach Boardwalk near the ocean

&amp;#x200B;

**Where's the lake??**

By themselves, maybe these are just coincidences and don't mean much. What's interesting (though maybe I'm just imagining it) is that I don't think I've seen any other characters next to the lake. A lake is often referenced (Luke talks about going fishing, etc), but I guess I always assumed it was outside of town. I didn't even realize that Stars Hollow had a body of water until I kept seeing Jess sitting on the docks, etc. I don't know what the geography of Stars Hollow is like, but it started feeling to me that when Jess turns up, suddenly a magical lake appears. I've started assuming it's probably in the park near the gazebo, or something, but I don't really have a grasp on where it's located.

On [this fan-created map](http://web.archive.org/web/20011206014118/http://www.geocities.com/ltlstargg/StarsHollow.html), there's two parks mentioned. Is there a lake in the park near the church? Is that where Sookie got married? And/or is there a lake near the park next to Luke's Diner, and Jess is always hanging out there since it's right next to his home?

On a [Stars Hollow wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_Hollow), there isn't mention of any bodies of water in Stars Hollow (though the page is mostly just a list of establishments, so I don't know if a lake should be grouped in there anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

**Symbolism?**

So... water is a pretty universal thing, a life-giving thing, and I'm sure it shows up many times in the show in many shapes and forms. I don't think Jess is the only character on the show that hangs out near the lake or drinks water. I listed some water-themed moments that showed up involving other characters at the bottom of this post, and I'm curious whether these other moments and story arcs tie in with what I'm thinking about Jess.

As a disclaimer, I'm possibly projecting too much here, since some of these topics are things I've been trying to work out in my own life lately. So, bear with me.

OK, so the first thing that comes to my mind regarding Jess and this water motif is that the dock where Jess hangs out may be some kind of representation of how Jess is trying to work out his emotions. From what we know, Jess hasn't known what it's like to have a stable family before he enters the show. Now, all of a sudden he's got Luke in his life: a very steady (read, ""resists change"") father figure. He's also got Lorelai, who from the get-go is (over?) involved and telling Jess how he should feel about Luke.

All this is in contrast, obviously, with Jess's absent father and neglectful mother. 

To be fair, I guess Lorelai's over-involvement isn't really a contrast to Jess's relationship with his own mom, as Lorelai discourages Luke from the beginning against letting Jess into his life. Not necessarily the opposite of neglectful. But anyway...

From what I can tell, the lake is a place where Jess retreats to sort out what must be a cascade (or blockage) of emotions and feelings about what he's gone through growing up, and to sort out feelings about the present and future. It's where he goes to figure things out about (or together with) Rory. He's really not equipped to have a healthy relationship, and of course Rory isn't equipped to sort out all the problems that Jess is still trying to figure out. Even if Jess knew how to talk about the childhood trauma he's trying to sort out instead of keeping it all hidden under the surface, Rory couldn't be expected to be his therapist. In any case, they seem to meet at this lake to try to figure out and attempt to have a relationship.

I don't know what the lake specifically could be said to represent. Emotional blockage? Deepness? An oasis after a troubled childhood? Maybe it's just a place where Jess goes to find peace. Maybe water, in general, is symbolic for ""emotions"" in this show.

Jess gets attacked by a swan, whose medium of travel is this lake. Is this swan-attack representative of self-sabotage? Is it a wake-up to himself that he needs to figure out his emotional issues if he wants to have healthy relationships in the future? In any case, he lies to Rory about it. He's very embarrassed to have gotten ""beaked"" in the face by a swan, which never really made sense to me. 

I mean, I never quite understood why this was a plot point in the first place, and I didn't understand why it would be so embarrassing for him to talk about. When I think of it through this scope of Jess the Aquatically Challenged Merman, I can see why he would be pretty embarrassed about getting hurt by unprocessed childhood trauma. It's hard stuff to talk about, and it's especially hard to talk about with someone you're romantically involved with. When you feel like you've found someone who loves and supports you, it can feel like a very big risk to share your feelings. If you've been abandoned in the past by parental figures, it's scary to do something that might ""make waves"" and lose you another shot at love.

&amp;#x200B;

This is as far as I've gotten so far on this rewatch, so I'm not sure how this water theme develops. I do remember that Jess goes to California eventually, and faces the Pacific Ocean. 

What could the ocean represent? I see it either/both as:

* a ""to scale"" version of the Stars Hollow water that Jess has been practicing ""emotional processing"" with. He's had a little microcosm of his traumas in Stars Hollow in the form of the lake, and now he has to face the real thing -- the ocean. Jess's issues were always larger than a small lake, but because of the gift of staying with Luke, he's had access to a more manageable version of his issues.
* Jess's dad's version of ""emotional issues,"" which have grown to the size of an ocean because they weren't addressed early on?

I'm not trying to say that a free-spirited guy who is resistant to settling down necessarily has issues in need of processing... just that the show presents Jess's dad this way, somewhat.

Maybe water doesn't necessarily mean ""unprocessed emotional issues..."" but that's where I seem to have drawn these connections to at this point. I'm very curious what others' thoughts are.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other characters and water**

OK, so to balance this out a little, I wanted to include some other water-related moments and themes that I remember from the show. These are probably just random, but still interesting.

* Luke loves fishing, and at some point teaches Lorelai how to fish in a kiddie pool in preparation for a date she has (S03, E12: ""Lorelai Out Of Water"")
* Rory goes to jail for stealing a yacht with Logan
* For some reason, Dean and the random water cooler in Lorelai's house are inextricably linked in my mind. This puts an interesting light on Dean's character (compared with Jess and the unfiltered/uncontained water at the lake)
* Lorelai, in general, loves snow and loves to smell it before it comes
* Apparently, the name ""Lorelei"" comes from a story of [a woman sitting on a rock, luring fishermen to their death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorelei_(name))
* Luke has this boat from his dad, that for a long time he keeps in Lorelai's garage (and later, I believe, sells to Kirk when he starts thinking he's been stagnating for too long)
* [Luke isn't a good swimmer (?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/byzj3h/luke_doesnt_know_how_to_swim/)) which is kind of interesting in light of how April becomes pretty passionate about swimming

&amp;#x200B;

**Slightly unrelated: fire?**

Finally, and probably truly a stretch to go here, but I thought it was interesting that the fire at the inn happened while Rory and Jess were dating. For me, through the scope of Wet Jess, this speaks somewhat to Lorelai's intense dislike of Jess.

Fire is understandably a theme in the episode ""Tales of Poes and Fire,"" which shows the aftermath of the fire at the inn. I just watched the episode and it's fresh in my mind, and there's a mention of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in there, as well as the gift of the mocha-scented candle that Tobin gives Lorelai. Speaking of Tobin and the candle, there's a thread I found just now saying that maybe [Tobin started the fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/4wlvth/what_caused_the_fire_at_the_independence_inn/). In the episode ""Swan Song"", where Jess originally gets beaked by the swan, Lorelai is apparently wearing a t-shirt that advertises fireworks ([mentioned in the comments here](https://gilmoregirls.fandom.com/wiki/Swan_Song)).

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

OK, anyway, I thought that this has all been interesting to think about, in terms of understanding Jess's character arc, as well as in understanding other characters' emotional transformations throughout the show. This post is more disorganized than I'd like but I hope it's clear enough to get the general idea across, and I'd love to hear others' thoughts on the general topic.

Lane couldn't seem to catch a single break through the whole run of the show, like she couldn't have anything good or any of her dreams or goals come to fruition. Let's take a look:

1. Lane falls for Henry Cho, the relationship falls apart because Lane can't talk to her mother about it.
2. Lane meets Dave, they get to have an actual relationship but then he moves away to Californiaaaaaaaaa (and they presumably break up, but that plot line is kind of dropped?)
3. Lane's band books a gig at the legendary CBGB's and she decides to take a big risk to go, but the show ends up getting cancelled. When she comes clean to her mother about where she was and tries to heal their relationship, her mother kicks her out.
4. Lane's band books another massive gig that record industry execs actually attend, but Zack acts like a baby and ruins it.
5. The band then goes on tour, Lane hustles and scrimps and saves to scrape together a $900 profit for them to record an album. The boys take the money and spend it on a computer instead.
6. Lane and Zack get married, she has sex for the first time, it sucks and she swears off sex thinking that it's always going to suck. Then she gets pregnant. With twins. (Zack then gets to go on tour while Lane has to stay home with the babies).

Not to mention that throughout this she's forced to conceal who she really is from her family because they won't accept her otherwise (though her mother eventually comes around), has to go to an Evangelical college anther best friend is Rory who doesn't seem to really notice or sympathise with anything that Lane goes through.

90,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2019-9-8,2019,9,8,2,d0z4gc,self.GilmoreGirls,"Thoughts on alternate Lucy, Olivia &amp; Rory storylines?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/d0z4gc/thoughts_on_alternate_lucy_olivia_rory_storylines/,crowdchatter,1567878411,"One of the things I wish GG had done differently was Rory's college experience. Paris' character was a great comedic twist and I'm thrilled they kept her around. I also loved her relationship with Doyle. But to be honest I thought the continuation of their relationship was kind of weird. For one, I still find it hard to believe that Yale would arrange them to be roommates. I remember at my university if you wanted to be roommates with someone you both had to list each other as ""desired roommate"" on the application form otherwise you wound up with a random stranger. But perhaps it's a money thing and her father bribed someone?

However, what I really really didn't like is that Rory's entire social life revolved around Paris and, in 2-3 episodes Marty and then Logan. It was so under-developed and sort of 2 dimensional. Instead, Lucy and Olivia would have been PERFECT as Rory's college pals. Rory didn't need to be a social butterfly but it'd have been great if she had 1-2 really close friends at college that were on her level socially/emotionally. Paris was well, Paris. And Logan's friends were more ""we're here if you want to party"" type of friends. I think Lucy &amp; Olivia could have been the college equivalent of her childhood/teen friendship with Lane. So I was thinking how they could have been written in earlier, and here's what I came up with:

Rory and Paris are roommates. During the ""open door party"" at the start of season 4, Lucy and Olivia and Rory start chatting (instead of those obnoxious twins) when Paris freaks out and kicks everyone out. A week later or whatever, they bump into each other in the dining hall while filling up on cereal or something and strike up a conversation about how intrigued Lucy is with Paris for being so, well, Paris. So they chat and that begins the starting point of their friendship.   
They advise Rory about things like being herself when she's writing that article so she can make it onto the daily news, they're there for her when she begins things with Dean, Marty joins their group as 'naked guy' when he becomes Lucy's boyfriend somewhere in season 4/5 and it's just a joke that Rory saw him naked but no one cares and we can avoid that whole awful Marty-lying-to-Lucy-and-still-being-in-love-with-Rory plot-line. Lucy and Olivia can be there for Rory when she feels like Logan cheated on her, and obviously the writers can develop their characters a little bit more, too. They could really add something more substantial to Rory's college experience. They can be there when she drops out of Yale, or perhaps they drift a little bit during that time. But either way I love the idea that they would be a solid part of her entire undergraduate experience. They were great characters and seriously good picks as Rory's college friends as opposed to her hanging out with Logan's vacuous/obnoxious social circle.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi y'all! I read the comments from last week, and I've changed things a little bit! There are still four levels:

1- Basic (this is 5 multiple choice questions, 1 point each)

2- Simple (this is 5 short answer questions, 2 points each)

3- Specific (this is 4 short answer questions, 3 points each, and they're about specific episodes/moments/lines)

4-Oh Shit (this is 1-3 REALLY hard short answer questions. Almost no one got these last time, that's kinda the point).

I'm keeping it mostly short answer because I think that GG is so specific with their references that everyone can remember the answer given the choices and it's supposed to be a little hard ;)

Also, **PLEASE NOTE**, I am the only one doing this. I have to type in every single variance of a response. Example:

Question: What is the name of the show?

Answers I have to enter so that Google doesn't mark a correct answer wrong: Gilmore Girls, Gilmore girls, gilmore girls, gilmore Girls.

So, if your spelling is off, it will be marked as incorrect. I can't account for all possible spelling errors because I have a full course load. Names are always capitalized. Lorelai is not spelled Lorelei, at least for my quizzes. Numbers are always '8' not 'eight', but I will try to remember to add the spelled out version as well.

You will be still be able to take last week's quiz [here](https://forms.gle/f9MPz55muwfVJ2ac7), but your answers will not be counted my the summary of the week below.

If you have questions, please let me know.

***Week's Summary:***

**First place**: u/BernieRoundbottom (31/39)

**Second place**: u/billmaks92 (30/39)

**Third place**: u/WhimsyPooh (28/39)

&amp;#x200B;

**The average score**: 14.23

**The median score**: 13/39

**The most common score**: 8/39

&amp;#x200B;

**The questions most people got wrong (correct answers/takers)**:

*Who did Lane have to go on a hay ride with?* (2/151)

Accepted answer(s): a future proctologist (I'll admit, doctor could have been correct)

Your answers: Her cousin, Patrick Cho, Young Chui, A future doctor

*Who was the irritating lady that kept asking Lorelai invasive questions at Rory's birthday party in 1.06? (*6/151)

Accepted answer(s): Mitzi

Your answers: Missy, Mitsy, Idk

*How many proposals do we see take place on the show?* (7/151)

Accepted answer(s): 8, eight

Your answers: 4, 5, 6

&amp;#x200B;

**My favorite poll answers:**  Which episode is the best episode &amp; why? 

Season 5: episode 17 - Pulp Friction. It has so many classic events happening a single episode. Kirk collects the pink and blue ribbons only to chase Lou Lou down the street screaming this is bigger than your love for pink. Luke and Lorelai get back together. Michels one hundred thousand dollars in cash and prizes shows up to ruin an important photo shoot of the dragonfly inn. They find Kirk sleeping naked in Lukes boat. The Quentin Tarantino party happens.  (no name)

""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"" because it's when Dean finally calls Rory on her shitty treatment of him and breaks up with her. Then she can be with Jess. :) ( u/cascadewallflower )

 Friday Nights Alright for Fighting- the dinner scene when everyone finally vents about whats been bugging them &amp; they all end up laughing about Emily ripping into Logans mom is a real family scene! ( u/jeanetteck )

Everything blows up, every issue they have had and I think it is something they all needed.  
Here's the script:

(....)

LORELAI: You're obviously upset about Christopher paying for Yale and I get it. We should have told you earlier, but let me just explain how it happened.  


RORY: No. It's my responsibility. Let me explain.  


EMILY: I don't think anyone needs to explain anything except why I'm not being allowed to clean myself.  


RORY: He came to me, and he asked if he could do anything and  


RICHARD: this really isn't necessary.  


RORY: I let him pay for Yale. He's my father.  


EMILY: \[Laughs\]  


LORELAI: You know something I don't, mom?  


EMILY: How convenient that he's her father now.  


RICHARD: Perhaps your father can reimburse me for the five cases of scotch I had to send the men in the bursar's office.  


RORY: I sure he would be happy to.  


EMILY: You know what else I find amusing?  


LORELAI: ""Reno 911!""?  


EMILY: I find it very amusing that Christopher is suddenly such a wonderful person.  


LORELAI: Mom!  


EMILY: It seams to me when I was in cahoots with him, everyone thought that I was a villain, and now suddenly you're in cahoots with him, and that's perfectly fine.  


LORELAI: Please don't say ""cahoots"" anymore. It's disturbing.  


EMILY: You're being hypocritical, don't you think?  


LORELAI: No I dont, you were trying to break Luke and me up, and I'm trying to put Rory through college.  


RICHARD: Rory was already being put through college by us.  


EMILY: Thats right.  


RORY: I didn't want you to pay for it anymore.  


EMILY: There, there it is.  


RICHARD: So you went to Christopher.  


RORY: He came to me.  


EMILY: Oh, please. You just wanted to hurt us.  


RORY: By taking money from my father?  


RICHARD: Yes, exactly!  


EMILY: I've had enough of this. I'm going back out to touch up my moonscape.  


RICHARD: I have some work to do.  


RORY: Fine I have to go anyhow.  


\[They all start waling away\]  
LORELAI: Hey! This is not gonna happen. You're not going back out to your moonscape, you're not going back to work, and you're not going home. Now, we all agreed to have Friday night dinner, and we're here, and I smell dinner, and, yes, apparently there are some issues to be worked out, but no one, and I mean no one, is leaving here until we do!  


\[Cut to the dining room and diner has started\]  
RORY: Things were out of control.  


EMILY: Not the point, simply not the  


RORY: It is completely the  


RICHARD: Rory, do not cut your grandmother off.  


RORY: Im just saying  


EMILY: You come running to us, begging us to take you in because you can't possibly deal with your mother.  


RORY: That's not what happened.  


EMILY: We take you in we pay to redecorate the pool house so you can have a place all your own.  


RORY: I did not ask you to do that.  


EMILY: You accepted it you did not turn it down. I didn't hear you saying, ""grandma, stop."" I didn't see you throw yourself at the decorators while they were putting up your very expensive wallpaper! And then when you don't like how things are going, you leave!  


RICHARD: With no notice, by the way, and you leave two strange boys in our house unsupervised.  


EMILY: We're missing two picture frames, by the way.  


RORY: Colin and Finn did not steal your pictures!  


RICHARD: \[yelling\] Do not raise your voice to your grandmother!  


EMILY: I never realized how spoiled you were, Rory, but I guess that's to be expected. Only children are always spoiled.  


RORY: I'm sorry I didn't leave a note.  


EMILY: My, that sounds heartfelt. Doesn't that sound heartfelt, Richard?  


RICHARD: Well I've never been more touched in all my life.  


RORY: I apologize. You don't believe it. I try to defend myself, and you don't want to hear it. So, apparently, there's nothing I can do here.  


EMILY: Oh, there's plenty you can do.  


RORY: What? What can I do?  


EMILY: Well first of all you can admit what you've done. You can apologize!  


RORY: I was just trying to apologize!  


LORELAI: Cut her some slack, mom! Rory was going through something terrible!  


EMILY: Life is full of terrible things, Lorelai.  


LORELAI: She was emotional when you're emotional, you don't think clearly. I remember a woman who tried to buy a plane when her granddaughter moved out.  


EMILY: I tried to time-share a plane. It is in no way even close to the same thing.  


LORELAI: \[The maid comes in\] I've never been so happy to see a salad in my entire life.  


\[Cut to later in the meal\]  
LORELAI: Ugh! I can't believe what I'm hearing!  


EMILY: If we'd known the extent of the issue, we might not have taken Rory in.  


LORELAI: I tried to tell you!  


EMILY: You did not!  


LORELAI: I came here and I told you exactly what happened with Mitchum, and you didn't want to hear it.  


RICHARD: I don't remember that!  


EMILY: I don't either!  


\[change of seating\]  
LORELAI: \[reenacting the scene, Lorelai is quite worked up\] ""The Huntzbergers told her she wasn't good enough, and Mitchum told her she didn't have it."" ""He what?!"" ""Yes, and now she's dropped out of Yale, but the three of us can knock some sense into her."" ""Of course we'll help you. This is not happening."" ""I'll call Charlie Davenport tomorrow."" ""Thank you, guys, so much. Just thank you."" End scene! \[Hits the table\]  


\[Cut to desert, every\]  
LORELAI: This is really good sorbet.  


EMILY: I know isn't it? Theresa made it herself.  


RORY: Mango?  
EMILY: Passion fruit.  


LORELAI: Delicious.  


RICHARD: It certainly is.  


\[cut to Lorelai and Rory in the dining room drinking coffee, Emily and Richard can be heard shouting off screen\]  
RICHARD: What are you thinking, buying an airplane?!  


EMILY: I didn't buy it. I looked at it!  


RICHARD: Well, what were you doing looking at a plane?!  


EMILY: I can look at a plane if I want to look at a plane!  


\[cut to the living room, everyone is laughing\]  
EMILY: So I lead her over to the good table, smiling like we are the best friends in the world, and I tell her, ""Shira, you don't think Rory ""is good enough to be in your family? ""She is. We are just as good as you are. ""After all, you are nothing but a two-bit gold digger, and how you managed to bag Mitchum I will never know.""  


LORELAI: You did not.  


RICHARD: Oh, yes, she did.  


EMILY: I told her Mitchum still plays around.  


LORELAI: \[gasps\]  


RICHARD: Oh, no no no. Tell her exactly what you said.  


EMILY: What did I say?  


RICHARD: About her weight going...\[jesters up and down\]  


EMILY: oh, yes, yes. I got it. I told her, ""Mitchum still plays around, you know."" Well, of course you know. ""That's why your weight goes up and down 30 pounds every 3 months.""  


LORELAI: \[excited\] Oh my  


RICHARD: Ruthless woman! \[Laughs\]  


LORELAI: I bow to the foot of the master.  


EMILY: I only wished I'd remembered to call her a cocktail waitress.  


LORELAI: Ooow. That's my mother's version of the ""c"" word.

RORY: I don't want to quit the D.A.R.  


EMILY: Well, too late.  


RORY: I was accepted and certified grandma. You can't just kick me out.  


EMILY: I can to.  


RORY: I know the rules backwards and forward, and I have done nothing to lose my status except argue with you, plus I'm in contact with more members than you are.  


EMILY: That is not true.  


\[They reach the living room, Lorelai and Richard and sitting on the couch\]

RORY: I talk to Tweenie Halpern all the time.  


EMILY: What are you doing talking to Tweenie Halpern?  


RORY: Im friends with Tweenie Halpern, I'm helping her daughter look at colleges. I'm gonna give her a tour of Yale.  


EMILY: You have no right to talk to Tweenie Halpern or anyone else in the D.A.R. That is my organization. \[she walks off\]  


RORY: I'm not quitting!  


EMILY: Oh, yes, you are!

LORELAI: He has a kid.  


\[Cut to Lorelai and Emily yelling off screen, Rory and Richard are sitting in the living room.\]

Dean was nice at the start. Cute and dependable. But his poor self-esteem got in the way according to me. And on top of that he cheated on his wife and then fought with her for checking his phone.

Jess. God I hate Jess so much. I hate his behaviour. He was irresponsible, flighty. And the way he just turns up at Rory's dorm and asks to run away! No you pathetic person, she won't do that.

Logan is also a prick. The way he treated Marty all those times. And he was such a rich snob.

And most of all I hate Rory.
She broke Dean's heart and went with a fellow like Jess who disappeared on her (karma). Then she just stood by as Logan and his rich loser friends made fun of her friend Marty. Honestly, she goes after the dark and twisty guys coz she's charmed by them and then cries when they're not boyfriend material.

For this reason, I think this story arc of Luke's is a great reminder of the kind of thing the show got right. Even now, many movies and television shows push the narrative that an emotionally closed off guy just needs the right woman to ""open him up,"" but GG addressed this in a positive way and took the burden off of the woman.

I also love how he then gives the books to Jess, since up until that point, Jess also fit the trope of a ""bad boy"" who needs a ""good girl"" to save him. GG subverts this by then having Jess work on himself away from Rory (he hits a road bump there, coming back to town and groaning ""i love u"" at her, but then seems to really become a better person).

How is the Dragonfly equity divided? Mike Armstrong's unrealistic wooing of Lorelai to the Durham Group raises the question, especially since Lorelai should be pondering not just for herself, but also on behalf of Sookie and Luke.   


Here are my assumptions/calculations:  


Cost of old Dragonfly property: $300,000  
Additional Cost to Renovate and Furnish: $800,000  
Initial Capital Investment by Lorelai &amp; Sookie: $100,000 each, giving them 50% equity  
Outstanding Loan Principal Assumed by the Business: $900,000

Additional Capital Provided by Luke: $35,000  


Total Cost to Restore Dragonfly: $1,135,000  


Lorelai &amp; Sookie each have 50% equity to start, but with Luke's investment (assuming he was given equity, as was implied by approving Dragonfly stationary), should give him 14.89% equity. If each of the ladies loses 7.447% of their equity in the process, that leaves the investors as follows: Lorelai: 42.553%, Sookie: 42.553%, Luke: 14.89%.

Or maybe Luke accepted no equity and wasn't a true investor, but rather just a loan facilitator (big mistake on his part).   


And how much would Mike Armstrong and the Durham Group offer them after 1 year of operation? I would guess only about $1,500,000--which would be a very generous offer, I think. That would create surplus owner's capital of $365,000, which would be distributed as follows: $155,318 to both Sookie and Lorelai, and $54,348.50 to Luke.

Not a bad return on capital for a one-year investment, and shelters them from risk. So why is Lorelai mulling without Luke's input? And why are the savvy business ladies only discussing the ramifications of sunning topless on European beaches?   


Anyway, this is what I do with my brain sometimes. Please let me know if you dispute and of my calculations or assumptions. (Then we can launch into a discussion of how much the Crap Shack cost to buy in the 90s, and how much the Chilton education cost for 2+ years).",9,21,False,self,,,,,

1- Basic (this is 5 multiple choice questions, 1 point each)

2- Simple (this is 5 short answer questions, 2 points each)

3- Specific (this is 4 short answer questions, 3 points each, and they're about specific episodes/moments/lines)

4-Oh Shit (this is 1-3 REALLY hard short answer questions. Almost no one got these last time, that's kinda the point).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm keeping it mostly short answer because I think that GG is so specific with their references that everyone can remember the answer given the choices and it's supposed to be a little hard ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, **PLEASE NOTE**, I am the only one doing this. I have to type in every single variance of a response. Example:

Question: What is the name of the show?

Answers I have to enter so that Google doesn't mark a correct answer wrong: Gilmore Girls, Gilmore girls, gilmore girls, gilmore Girls.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if your spelling is off, it will be marked as incorrect**. I can't account for all possible spelling errors because I have a full course load. Names are always capitalized. Lorelai is not spelled Lorelei, at least for my quizzes. Numbers are always '8' not 'eight', but I will try to remember to add the spelled out version as well.

**My favorite poll answers:**  What is the worst quality about your favorite character?

&amp;#x200B;

**Lorelai-**

Lorelai - keeps too many secrets from people who are important to her ( u/sleepykittycat )Lorelai doesnt seem to appreciate what a good friend and neighbor Babette is.

Lorelai is my favorite character, but her worst quality is her self sabotaging her relationships and generally being self centered.

**Paris**\-

Pariss worst quality, her neuroticism, is also what makes her a fun, compelling character to watch. ( u/Levanw01 )

Paris is obviously crazy mean, but has the best lines in the show! ( u/beeksandbix )

**Emily-**

She has too much pride, and it stands in the way of her true happiness.

While Shiras approach to Logans relationship with Rory was to attack her and let her know she wasnt wanted, Mitchums was to try and turn her into someone who would be beneficial to the Huntzberger company. Mitchum probably recognized that Rory would not become a trophy wife and instead of risking her working for another news outlet outside The Huntzberger Group decided to try and familiarize her with the company so that she could help Logan run the business in the future. 

I dont think Rory not getting a position at the Eagleton Gazette was because she didnt have it (although I dont think she was a particularly good journalism intern, just a good assistant). I think even if shed blown Mitchum away with her initiative and writing, he still wouldnt have given her a position. I think he was grooming her to become familiar with the operations of what his company did so that once it came Logans time to run it, Rory would be able to sufficiently support him.

1. Lorelai and Chris have sex and conceive rory somewhere around January 1984, when lorelai was 15.

2. Lorelai turns 16 in April of 1984, the age she gives birth to rory. 

2. Lorelai tells her parents in maybe May of 1984, when she was 4 months pregnant. 

3. Rory is born in October of 1984, and Christopher asks lorelai to marry her, and its safe to assume lorelai says no. 

Heres where it gets a little confusing for me.

So lorelai and Chris didnt get married, but how exactly did the rest of Rorys upbringing go?

When rory was 17 and mia came to town, This conversation went down: 

&gt; MIA: I miss you. Hey, do you realize it was fifteen years ago almost to the day?

&gt; LORELAI: Yes it was.

&gt; RORY: What was?

&gt; MIA: To the day when this skinny little teenage girl showed up at the inn. She had this tiny little thing in her arms.

&gt; LORELAI: A little thing named Rory.

So lorelai came to the inn when rory was 2, asking for a job, got it, and lived in the shed. But what about the previous two years? Did lorelai live with her parents? Did she just stay home all day and take care of rory, or did she attempt some kind of schooling while emily or a nanny looked after rory? 

this also brings up what exactly happened to Christopher, did Christopher just never visit rory or lorelai when rory was a baby even though they lived pretty close together? Did emily and Richard not force Francine and strobe to make Christopher visit rory? 

Lorelai did say that she left to escape Emilys abusive remarks, so who made the first move to contact each other after lorelai left? According to rory in season 1, they saw each other during holidays before Friday night dinners became a thing. Lorelai was independent with a job and had no reason to talk to emily or Richard, so i always wondered who made the first move to talk to each other and when it happened.

I think this season Lauren and Alexis are most comfortable in their rolls, they have been at it for 3 years and its before big changes.  I love Lorelai/Luke essentially co-parenting the Rory/Jess relationship, it shows me had ASP kept both of the characters in character in 6/7 they would have made great parents.   It's also nice to see Lorelai and Rory not agreeing about Jess, but Lorelai tries to help Jess as a boyfriend anyway. 

Rory has her most interesting season between Dean v Jess and her college decisions, and I usually don't care about Rory so that's big for me.  

Lorelai doesn't have much of a love life, Alex is a potentially interesting character but nothing really happens with it, which is realistic, sometimes that happens.  The Max stuff is a bit dumb but whatever.

Ding - Season 5

I'm a sucker for Luke/Lorelai so I def ding this season.  It has it ups and down, and ASP does a poor job showing them as the couple we all know they'd be, but it's a guilty pleasure for me.
(Runner up season 1: Where is all began)

Kill:  Season 6 and 7 are a hard debate. But I think I kill season 6.

I looked up to her and wanted to be like her when I got older. I thought the boys she dated were so old and mature and I couldnt wait to grow up and date. I couldnt wait to go to college and eat in the dining hall and read under a tree. Then, I continued to watch Gilmore Girls through high-school and college and related to so much of what Rory and her peers were experiencing. Without even realizing it, I was on the same page as that group in the show. It felt normal to witness their experiences because I was at the same exact age. Now, I have graduated college. I STILL watch the show, but now with a whole new perspective. It is strange and also very neat to watch being so much older. I still see Rory, Jess, Logan, etc. as so much older than me. Even though now, I am several years older than they are in the showin an entirely new phase of life. I think fondly of when I gazed at Logan on screen and thought how lovely it would be to have such a mature and adult boyfriend. I think about where I am in life now and how different it all turned out. But watching this show always makes me feel the same way. All of those nostalgic feelings re-emerge :) I am constantly amazed by this show and howno matter when or what age I watch itit always feels like home. I always come back.

Shes great in the first few seasons, but it all goes downhill when Jess comes into the picture.

Then, after all the heartache shes put Dean through, she realizes what a great boyfriend he was when he becomes someone elses husband.

She has an opinion and a big mouth every time Lorelai makes a mistake but the second Lorelai gives Rory her opinion on something Rory cuts her off. She quits Yale and goes crying to granddaddy and has no problem enjoying all the benefits of Richard and Emilys privileged lives, until she changes her mind and it no longer benefits her. The way she just moved out without a word and then proceeds to treat her grandparents always disgusts me. 

She doesnt tell her mom about big decisions she makes until after shes made them yet throws a big fit when Lorelai and Chris get married without telling her before. 

She is a bad friend to Lane and basically always makes everything about her. The list just goes on and on.

2- Simple (this is 5 short answer questions, 2 points each)

3- Specific (this is 4 short answer questions, 3 points each, and they're about specific episodes/moments/lines)

Question: What is the name of the show?

Answers I have to enter so that Google doesn't mark a correct answer wrong: Gilmore Girls, Gilmore girls, gilmore girls, gilmore Girls.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if your spelling is off, it will be marked as incorrect**. I can't account for all possible spelling errors because I have a full course load. Names are always capitalized. Lorelai is not spelled Lorelei, at least for my quizzes. Numbers are always '8' not 'eight', but I will try to remember to add the spelled out version as well.

I'm sorry, but I'm VERY tired of the whole ""OMG HE WAS A TERRIBLE ABUSIVE NEGLECTFUL BOYFRIEND BECAUSE (insert absolute crap)"" that is directed at all 3 of Rory's boyfriends. 

1. None of them were abusive to her. None of them tried to assault her. None of them neglected her. They were all stupid teenagers, just like Rory. 
2. Gilmore Girls isn't about that type of character. It's not even implied that there's abuse in the entire show toward ANYONE because GG is a feel good character show, not the Clockwork Orange or Pulp Fiction. Chill.

Dean- The whole not able to let Rory focus on school thing was irritating. He always had a complex about Rory being smarter, more driven, and more able than he was. He also had an issue with the wealth of her family. If they'd gotten together, she would have earned more and he would have been able to be a stay at home dad to his millions of kids and work on fancy cars and blah blah blah while Rory earns money being famous and good at her job.

Jess- He's so bogged down by his issues with his family that he can't give her the attention that he wants. He's always on the defense and it makes him too aggressive, he doesn't feel accepted so he ostracizes himself. He isn't in a place to be anyone's boyfriend. He tries, but he has his priorities so out of whack and he fails senior year without telling anyone because he wanted to pretend he wasn't struggling. If he communicated, he and Rory could've had a billion study dates. And Luke would have given him more shifts at the diner.

Logan- the dude needed to grow tf up sometimes. He had to grow a spine and talk to his dad about the fact that he wasn't going to be who Mitchum wanted him to be. He worked really hard on himself at some points, but it just wasn't possible for him to be a happy and functional boyfriend/husband while he was under his daddy's thumb.

None of my friends watch this show, so I'd like to have a discussion about this with someone haha 

In the episode *after* Max proposes to her with the thousand yellow daises at the inn, lorelai is just a complete mess. she's one of my favourite characters, but this episode made me want to just slap her in the face. 

From the beginning of the episode, when she gets mad at Luke in the diner after she tells him that Max proposed. At times during that conversation, it's like lorelai was waiting for him to have a nervous breakdown because of it? I know that 2 mins before that, Rory tells her while they're eating, that Luke has always had a thing for her and that's why the whole of Stars Hollow was peeking through the windows. Lorelai completely denies that. Are we REALLY supposed to believe that despite Rory, Sookie, Emily and Babette etc ALL telling Lorelai that Luke has feelings for her several times and over many years, she *just can't* fathom the idea of luke liking her. If she really didn't believe it, then why was she expecting Luke to be upset or feel a type of way about Max proposing to her...  

Later on in the episode when they are at the Gilmore's for Friday dinner, and Emily is clearly excited about something. Lorelai is lowkey expecting her parents to know about the engagement? And then when Emily and Richard are giving Rory all the attention by celebrating her being in top 3% of her class... she zones out and moves a ring from her index finger to the ring finger RIGHT INFRONT OF EMILY expecting her to say something about it. she couldn't handle all the attention being on rory at that moment, and wanted to snatch emily &amp; richard's attention towards her getting engaged DESPITE not even telling them about it until a couple of episodes later. Has anyone else analysed this particular scene? Do you think that Lorelai was being jealous of Rory having her parents' attention or was it just typical Lorelai behaviour? She isn't dumb, she wanted her mother to make a comment about the ring thing. 

The real cherry on top is the absolute disrespect moments later, when she came back from her phone call with Max and started screaming with Rory .... right infront of emily and richard and then lying about it when they asked. I will never get over the fact that lorelai thought that was an appropriate time let alone that she wouldn't tell her parents right away. I'm really lazy at typing and could go deeper about this all. There are other moments that make me believe that Lorelai gets jealous of Rory. sorry if none of this makes sense oops",7,2,False,self,,,,,

And to think about the weirdness of when Luke and Lorelai's first date happened.

In ""The Incredible Shrinking Lorelai's"", Lorelai tells the person on the phone that the opening day for the Dragonfly is May 6th, and the reservations made are for the 8th and 9th. That means the test run of the inn is the weekend before (we know it's a weekend based on a FND conversation), making it May 1st and May 2nd. Luke leaves that Sunday (May 2nd) for the Renaissance Faire. According to ""A Messenger, Nothing More"", Luke is gone for 7 weeks. Giving a few days wiggle room, he's back, at the latest, end of June. 

Even if we were to assume that the Dragonfly didn't meet the timetable and had to open slightly later, taking into account Yale's academic calendar for 2004 and Rory's finals and how she was still in finals sleep schedule at the beginning of ""Raincoats and Recipes"" (her last final at the latest would be May 8th because she was a Saturday orphan, meaning the test run would be the 15th), the timeline still has Luke coming back early July. The test run being in mid-May also lines up with Jason telling Luke that he and Lorelai had been together for 6 months, since the Harvard-Yale game is mid/end-November (it was November 22nd in 2003). The point is, no matter how you slice it, Luke is getting back early July.

Luke and Lorelai don't go on their first date until Rory is moving back to Yale. Move in date for Yale is around the end of August. Are we supposed to believe that for two months, Luke and Lorelai didn't go out? Lorelai confirms that  Sniffy's night is their actual first date:

&gt;LORELAI: This has been a really great first date.

and her conversation with Rory seems to indicate that as well:

&gt;LORELAI: We were just talking about our date for tonight  
  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: A real date? Finally!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Yeah, finally.

I can't see it being possible at all that Luke and Lorelai, for two months, didn't find an opportunity to go out. Or, was Sniffy's not actually their ""first date""? Did they actually have movie nights and other hangouts as a couple but not ""a real date"" in the two month interim between ""A Messenger"" and ""Written in the Stars""?

So Rory has dropped out of Yale and is living with Richard and Emily. She is doing her community service hours and isnt working. There is a scene where she is in the kitchen and begins talking in Spanish to the maid that is cleaning the silver. Rory begins to help her and then Emily walks in. She yells, Rory! and becomes visibly upset that Rory is speaking to this woman and helping her. She tells Rory to stop and to go swim.

BUT, after watching a few scenes later I made a new connection. Soon after, they are all sitting in the living room when Richard and Emily offer Rory their help in finding her a job. She happily accepts their help. It seems innocent enough; they know Rory needs to work and make money so they offer to help. BUT, seconds later, a new maid walks in and Emily introduces her as Draguta from Romania. She is obviously very unfriendly, likely to deter Rory from engaging in conversation with her. 

Now the connection: when Emily walked in on Rory helping and talking to the maid, she IMMEDIATELY had a flash of Rory following her mothers footsteps and throwing her life away just to become a maid. She didnt want Rory to go down this path, so she and Richard had to put a stop to it. Thats why they offered to help find her a job in their world. The world of business and DAR and upscale living. They would have been ashamed to let Rory end up like her mother. I think this is what Emily was thinking in that moment where she paused and stared at the silver. She was livid and got Richard in on her plan to make sure Rory doesnt end up like that.",7,19,False,self,,,,,

An important caveat: I am probably not capable of staying awake for the whole run, but I will try. I hope you will forgive me a hyperbolic headline.

I am going to live-tweet this experience; you can find me on Twitter [@sixangryghosts](http://twitter.com/sixangryghosts). You can also email me at StarsHollowOrBust (at) gmail dot com. If it seems like people around here are into the idea, I will check in with y'all as things get interesting, I already have one person just waiting for me to get to the tragedy (?!) of Paris Gellar, whatever that is. 

Some details:

**Which Charity:** Intentionally unspecified! Pick something thats important to you and send them a donation. Forward me the receipt (obscuring your personal info if you so choose) so I can keep a running total. Please note political candidates and/or parties are not, for our purposes, charities.

**Whats In It For You:** Good feelings about donating, and also a post card! If you leave your info on the receipt or otherwise include your address, I will send you a postcard bearing custom Gilmore Girls-themed artwork and haikus about coming of age or something. If you include a social media handle I will certainly give you public thanks. 

**Who I am:** Im Pete. Ive done a sleepless marathon three times, once with Dawsons Creek (actually kind of fun!), Gossip Girl (less so), and Star Trek: TNG (so much fun.) All told we have raised more than $21,000 for various charities! Also one time I ate pancakes for 24 hours (an incredible amount of unfun) and raised $5,000 for a domestic violence charity. If you're curious about what my twitter looks like mid-marathon, [here is a sample from the Dawson's Creek run](https://imgur.com/a/pRMkpFx). I think by that point I had been up for about 32 hours, collapsed for about 5, then had been up for another 22. I had become suspect of the limits of Dawson's charms.

I was just wondering what the timeline for Luke's love life is?

Bare with my math as I'm not 100% positive and did a lot of eyeballing.
He knew Anna Nardini at LEAST 12 years ago (in 1996?) (but probably longer since he's a ""serial monogamist"" according to Liz). He was on-again-off-again before ending things with Rachel 5 years before season 1 ( in 1995). So at what point was he with Rachel and then at what point was he with Anna? And if he met Lorelai 8 years before their first date, they would have met in 1996, which is cutting it really close between Rachel AND Anna.
This is a side note but I also don't understand how Lorelai would have lived in Stars Hollow in the late 1980s and never walked into Luke's until the mid 90s? Was that when she moved into the house (out of the inn)?

&amp;#x200B;

NOW! 

When Jess left (end of season 3) it was a spin off, but that didn't take off. I think that the only reason he left was because of that &amp; the fact that he wasn't actually an original plan but a character meant to keep Luke and Lorelai apart for a while. However**, I think Jess changed as a concept.** Two examples I can think of are: 

Family Guy- I know a lot of people don't watch this and I am no expert, but in that show there is Brian (a dog), Peter (the dad) and Stewie (the baby). Originally, Brian was supposed to be the straight man for Peter's crazy plot-controlling antics. However, one episode was created where everyone was busy doing stuff except for Brian and Stewie, so they got stuck together (season 2). This ends up changing their relationship from mutual loathing to being best friends because the writers never realized how well Stewie being an insane/insanely intelligent and homicidal baby goes with Brian being a stuffy know it all who doesn't actually know anything but likes to look smart. 

How I Met Your Mother- if you know the show, you know the outrage surrounding the ending. Basically, in season 1 (and a lot of other seasons) Barney will f\*ck anything that moves. Anything. He hits 200 women at one point in the series, he has a playbook to get women into bed, he hates commitment, he's a caricature of a person (and I think that's played up by the fact that he's Ted's romantic rival and Ted is telling the story, but that is another post for another subreddit). Barney falls in love with Robin over time and it changes his perspective on life. He wants love, he wants a family, he starts dealing with the trauma from his past, etc. It gets to the point where he abandons his grossness and becomes a different person because Robin deserves it. Then, they toss that crap away so that the trope of main-guy-gets-his-girl can live on (similarly to ATLA (Which could be another example, but this is too long already). 

**Jess is a foil for Dean.** I know that Dean looked like he was nerfed for Jess's arrival. The issue was that this didn't just happen for Jess. If you look at the timeline, Dean's issues started when he got berated by Richard at dinner. He was made to feel less than and that started this whole complex that made him feel stupid and poor. He started to be uncomfortable thinking about Rory's goals (Harvard for example) because he felt like he was being left in the dust. This conflicted with the previous times he was proud of Rory and created a cognitive dissonance because he would just get upset with himself for being upset with Rory and then it would pile up onto his stress and turn into a vicious cycle that ruined their relationship ([picture explanation](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9baaa94dce0ef2f0ae8fd460a123271/2cd78a7e020c78ef-39/s540x810/99af08ded08f0698e6dafff269c93ec840f7596f.png)).

Now, I think that if instead of getting upset about Jess, Dean shrugged it off? No one would ship Jess and Rory nearly as much as they do now. I'm saying that as a die hard Jess fan. [When Jess meets Dean for the first time](https://youtu.be/hsrHEWAVmHw?t=109)  Dean shrugs him off. He's secure in his relationship. You would have seen Jess as annoying. But when Dean gets put on the defensive, it legitimizes the threat to his relationship both to Rory and the viewers. It's alright to have a crush when you are in a relationship, you're human. But when Dean made it clear that he didn't want her and Jess to hang out, that he was uncomfortable with Jess even being around? That's when he started to lose Rory's attention. She wanted to hang out with Jess because he was a smart guy that liked what she liked (Dean did know about some literature, but he wasn't ever a huge fan. He preferred other things &amp; Rory tended to introduce him to a lot of stuff that Jess already knew) and making it clear that she shouldn't wasn't a healthy way to deal with it. Should have talked to her.

**Instead, the writers chose to legitimize the threat of Jess to Dean** and eventually Jess ousted the guy. Then he disappeared for reasons not related to his relationship with Rory (the whole 3.19-3.21 arc is only because they had another show for him, it didn't make sense to kick him off the show like that if he wasn't going to resolve his character issues on his spin-off show). 

Rory then returns to the safety and comfort of Dean while things in her life are turbulent, etc. Not good choices on anyone's part if you just remember the fact Dean *is married*. Then, Dean leaves for good when he sees Logan and Rory hanging out and it reminds him of the insecurities he had before with Jess. Dean's exit is clearly final and he isn't shown in his best light yelling at Luke. Either way, it's clear he is not coming back &amp; it probably would have gone a similar way if Jared didn't have to leave because their relationship was on the downslope because of the way they got together (again, he cheated on his wife so being with Rory made him feel guilty). 

Then we have Logan. Love it. Good guy. If Jess never returned again after season 3 or only returned as a family member (because he's basically Luke's kid and you can't tell me he wouldn't come to holidays, meaning Rory would see him a few times a year) then Logan would have been the CLEAR winner. The Dean/Rory relationship was abandoned, bleeding in the gutter, Jess was off doing who knows what, and Logan was there to grow and evolve with his girlfriend, her making him responsible and him bringing her fun.

**HOWEVER**.

**They bring Jess back 6 times.** This is where the whole please-don't-think-I-think-I'm smarter-than-anyone thing comes in. From the books I've read, my own experience, and the classes I've taken, I have learned that shows/books/movies don't do anything without a reason. 

Example: Shadow Hunters series. There are 6 characters: 3 monster hunters, 1 werewolf, one girl who found out she was a monster hunter's daughter, and her super nice human friend. They talk about how the human friend is boring and useless. Then they talk about how they *haaate* vampires. Guess who turns into a vampire 4-5 books later? The boring nice human friend, who goes on to prove them wrong about vampires. 

Jess keeps coming up, just like that whole vampire-hate thing in the book series.

1. 4.12: He is CLEARLY not over Rory
2. 4.13: He says I love you to Rory.
3. 4.20: He ends the episode by admitting to Luke that he told Rory he loved her.
4. 4.21: He begs Rory to go away with him (I imagine this is just for the summer? He wouldn't take her from school).
5. 6.08: He goes on a quasi-date with Rory that Logan tags along with, yells at her that she's being stupid (which gets her back to school despite her mother already having talked about it). 
6. 6.18: They kiss, she apologizes for almost using him to cheat, and he says ""I don't deserve this"" and ""It is what it is. You. Me.""

**Why would they bring him back if it didn't have a point???**

This is what makes me think that Jess might have been end game. They had so many options:

1. Jess never comes back- doesn't make sense because of Luke and Lorelai's connection, but c'est la vie. Maybe he's a surfer dude in California with blonde streaks and a puka shell necklace.
2. Jess comes back as a family member- Makes sense. He would be in 1-2 episodes a season, he'd apologize to Rory, and they would be friends that trade book suggestions and text maybe once a month. This would make it CLEAR that they didn't have any lingering romance
3. Jess come back and they have it out- Similarly to Dean, Jess would come back and they would have a connection-ending moment. She'd yell at him for leaving, he'd yell at her for always trusting Dean instead of her (Swan Song is evidence). Then it'd get quiet and he would leave, similarly to how she did in 6.18
4. Jess comes back and has moved on- if Jess had a new girlfriend then it would be clear that he was over it, maybe Rory would cry, then it's totally over.

**But they chose to keep bringing him back as a romantic adversary**. Jess made Logan uncomfortable just by existing. Logan could tell that they used to date by their vibe the way that Dean could tell they were digging each other in season 2.

There was literally no point in bringing him back if they didn't have plans for him.

My theory is that Jess would have appeared again in season 7 if ASP was in charge, then becoming a recurring character in the last 3/4 or 1/2 of the planned season 8. They'd have gotten together at the end, maybe after trying to be friends for most of the season because Rory was licking her wounds from breaking up with Logan. Or maybe Jess would oust Logan the way he did Dean if Rory and Logan didn't break up. I don't see how Jess was anything but a waste of airtime if they didn't plan on doing anything with him. There was so much going on in the episodes that he was in that unless he had a point, they wouldn't have used him.",20,0,False,self,,,,,

In some Gilmore Girls alternate universe what do you think would happen had in her teenage years Rory started  developing more of a life and world view outside of Lorelai? Lorelai  says that her and Rory dont do sports and they dont eat healthy. Lets  say Rory found she liked eating salads, and (since Alexis Bledel plays  soccer) actually found she enjoyed soccer. What if she started hanging  out with people her own age. Im not saying her personality has to do a  complete 180% but less of an extension of Lorelai and more like her very  own person. 

How do you think Lorelai would react? She always  talked about how her and Rory were like one complete person and how they  were almost exactly the same. What if Rory had started showing some  difference, maybe ones that were completely harmless but Lorelai didnt  understand?

But about two years ago, my friend told me his dad, who he hadn't seen in several years, was back in town. I said that's great and the only response I got was an eye roll. The following week we were at a coffee shop when an extremely good-looking man came up to us and introduced himself to me. It was my friend's dad. He was only nineteen when my friend was born, and I'm four years older than my friend, so his dad was just fifteen years my senior.

The following week I was at a bookstore and ran into his dad. We started talking, small talk mostly, but he asked me at one point if I was aware of how beautiful I am. Like my friend, my response was to roll my eyes. This man was one of the most shameless flirts I have ever met in my life. With me, with any woman that was even a little bit attractive. All while popping in and out of my friend's life.

I got a call from him one night begging me to talk to my friend, who had cut off contact with him. I told him I'd see what I could do, but couldn't promise anything at that point.  My friend was living across the country in Los Angeles. I did finally get him to talk to his dad.

His dad is now out in LA trying to get famous. (I wish I were joking.) He still likes my pictures on Facebook, and loves the ones where I'm wearing a bathing suit. I'm flattered, but it's also really gross.

1- Basic (this is 5 multiple choice questions, 1 point each)

2- Simple (this is 5 short answer questions, 2 points each)

3- Specific (this is 4 short answer questions, 3 points each, and they're about specific episodes/moments/lines)

4-Oh Shit (this is 1-3 REALLY hard short answer questions. Almost no one got these last time, that's kinda the point).

I'm keeping it mostly short answer because I think that GG is so specific with their references that everyone can remember the answer given the choices and it's supposed to be a little hard ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, **PLEASE NOTE**, I am the only one doing this. I have to type in every single variance of a response. Example:

Question: What is the name of the show?

Answers I have to enter so that Google doesn't mark a correct answer wrong: Gilmore Girls, Gilmore girls, gilmore girls, gilmore Girls.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if your spelling is off, it will be marked as incorrect**. I can't account for all possible spelling errors because I have a full course load. Names are always capitalized. Lorelai is not spelled Lorelei, at least for my quizzes. Numbers are always '8' not 'eight', but I will try to remember to add the spelled out version as well.

The entirety of human language cannot begin to express my disdain for her. That sniveling worm, that grunting ape, that whining dog. She's insulted, demeaned, and outright mocked forces beyond her comprehension, and an end shall soon be upon her. As we speak, the legions of Hades come against her, there will be no mercy, no recompense, and no respite, for her transgressions against Stars Hallow are beyond forgiveness, and she will answer for them. Eternal torment and woe be upon you Lorelei, lowliest of fools, weakest of mankind, dirtiest of filth, for oblivion's embrace is beyond you. One might be tempted to apply conventional insults to her, you are an idiot, a shameless attention whore, an ugly motherfucker, a whiny bitch, sleezeball, and so forth. But the fact of the matter is that those insults and the various colourful variations and combinations of which never the less give her too much credit. Even idiots can be put to good use, even if just as projects to cheer people up or sweaping the floor. An attention whore might be amusing in some way even if just by accident and plenty of ugly people are decent and respectable and better despire their asthetic deficiencies. Whiners can contribute too, even if they make a fuss over nothing and are annoying as fuck and a sleezeball might have some good ideas despite his loathesome mannarism and attitudes. Not that these terms could not be applied to Lorelei, no, no. But because the people that those words described can be put to use in some small way to make this world a better place, or at least have some vaugely redeeming qualities. Lorelei, however does not. Never before in the history of the universe have the forces of nature come together to create such an abyssmally substandard human being such as her. I can't watch this show anymore. I wince every time she opens her mouth. Never in my life have I despised a character as much as Lorelei. I cannot wait until Disney+ comes out and I cancel my Netflix and that way I'll never be able to accidentally watch this atrocity again.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

If you're part of any of the GG facebook groups then you most likely know what i'm on about. Most the time it seems like they are arguing over who the father is and whether or not a new series will be made. 

Whereas over here on reddit you can have an in depth conversation on character development and how their emotional state at that current time could effect their decisions etc etc. 

So i guess i just wanted to thank you, Reddit GG community. For just being brilliant for discussions and everything GG",26,146,False,self,,,,,
