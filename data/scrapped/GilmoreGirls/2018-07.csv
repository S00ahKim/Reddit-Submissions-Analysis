The premise of the episode - Richard in the hospital - is grounded precisely because of how it brings everyone together, laying the groundwork for a lot of layered and authentic interactions.

My thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/8wdv29/i_rewatched_here_comes_the_son_my_thoughts/,Bookbringer,1530822839,"Usually, I skip this episode, but I recently saw a few cute clips that made me question if my vague memory of disliking it would hold up.  Last night, I gave it a rewatch.  And it's real mixed bag.

The Gilmore Girls half of it is very average.  There's a few gems like Lorelai forcing a hug on Paris (Give in to it, baby) and Rory telling Emily she's being stupid to drive Lorelai away.  Rory and Luke's subtle sadness at Jess's departure is painful, but satisfying.  Rory's intense busy-ness and overscheduling also reminded me so much of her first break up with Dean, I wonder if she'd already kind of figured they were over.  All in all, it's no better or worse than the average episode.

The Jess half is a horse of a different color.  I love the raw concept of Jess trying to figure his shit out in a house full of strays named after characters, getting his edges softened.  And there's a few nice moments (I definitely chuckled when Jess told the dogs he'd bite back, and I love him marveling at the room full of books).  But overall, it falls pretty flat.

Everything from the sets to the wardrobe lack the subtlety and lived-in feel that makes Gilmore Girls feel grounded.  Sasha's garden is cool, but her home is way too bright and undamaged for me to believe all those animals live there. Her random comments to neighbors seem forced not friendly. I hate her 'quirky' headwrap, and Jess's ""angsty teenager"" costume makes me cringe.  Any outfit he wore in any past episode would've worked better than two layers of black topped with zipperific leather and an inexplicably unbuckled belt.  He could've been overdressed for the beach without looking like a 13 year old who'd just discovered Hot Topic.

The dialogue is actually pretty good, but only Milo seems up to delivering it.  I know some people love Sherrilyn Fenn and think Rob Estes mimicked Jess's mannerisms really well, but I don't see it.  She seems like she's trying too hard to seem warm; it feels fake.  He plays every line way too straight, and his mannerisms just seem hammy, like he's doing an impression of Jess.  Both performances ring really false to me.

However, the biggest problem with it is that the central shtick - parent and child grow up together - doesn't translate well to this context.  Lorelai works as a child-like parent who makes a lot of mistakes because her genuine love for Rory saturates every scene.  Jimmy has no such redeeming value.  Child abandonment is a starkly heinous act.  He needed either an exceptional excuse or a metric fuckton of remorse to make me not hate him.  Instead, he gives a blase admission that he didn't feel up to fatherhood, and an audacious complaint that Jess is busting his balls, all while making his desperate child beg for a floor to crash on.

All in all, I guess my original impressions mostly held up.  I maintain Jess was a strong enough character (and Milo a strong enough actor) that a spin-off about him getting his life together could have been really cool.  But shows need more than one good character to work, and this one just didn't have enough going for it.  It's frustrating, but it is what it is.

That's crappy both to Lorelai and even more so to Sherry - and I'm always baffled by how Lorelai doesn't call him out on it.

From the episode transcript:

CHRISTOPHER: I know I should've told you.  
LORELAI: Oh no, that's fine. That's totally your business.  
CHRISTOPHER: No, I meant to, butLor, it's just that you and I are so connected and...  
LORELAI: Chris, please, I get it. I think it's really great, I really do. 

Having this in mind, he does something similar in ""It Should've Been Lorelai"" - not mentioning the fact that he'll be attending Rory's debate in Chilton with Sherry. Was he deliberately trying to make Lorelai jealous? Was he hoping for her to tell him to ditch Sherry? His motivations have never been clear to me.",6,14,False,self,,,,,

**Always a Godmother, Never a God** - Missing Rory (Alexis Bledel), Lorelai (Lauren Graham) tries to call her and is upset to find that Rory's cell phone is no longer in service. Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) asks Lorelai and Rory to be the godparents to her two children in the hope that they will reconcile when they see each other at the ceremony. However, mother and daughter end up fighting when Lorelai realizes that Rory gave her new cell number to Sookie but not to her. Logan (Matt Czuchry) learns that his father expects him to graduate this year and enter the family business. Wanting to break free from family pressures, Logan whisks Rory off to a weekend in New York.

Like constantly talking about things to do with herself, obsessing over her own successes and even putting that before anything else- even doing so at a funeral.
I felt like it would be interesting to go into a little more depth on my opinion of it. I feel like a lot of her selfishness really comes from the fact that she had Rory so young. Most teenagers have selfish streaks like Lorelai has. And I feel like the writers wanted to show some of the more negative sides of having a child so early- like missing out and having to grow up crazy fast, but also holding onto some of the qualities that go away from progression into adulthood. I feel like she also obsesses over the things that she cares about because she came from a background in which Emily does a similar thing. Mainly about more materialistic things. But also about groups and things she's involved with. I feel like they also wanted to show that the way someone is raised shows through in certain cases regardless of the person. Lorelai didn't like the wealth, she didn't like how her parents obsessed over it, mainly Emily. But even still, those selfish, maybe even entitled streaks come through, even though she's a kind, bubbly and loving character.

I also love the casual outdoor piano, and Sookie's giant floral wedding cake.

My only complaint about Sookie and Jackson's wedding is Sookie's long sleeves. It's a summer wedding, and I think Sookie's dress would have been perfect sleeveless.

There are many to choose from.

For Dan it's a smaller list, but he wrote some great ones.  One of the best, I think, is *Christopher Returns* (S1, E15).  There are several pivotal scenes in that episode my favourite is the one between Richard and Lorelai where Lorelal really shows her childish side (""I get it. Im horrible. So why dont you disown me and adopt Christopher, you love him."").  I understand how she feels, as if she's being blamed because Christopher agreed to give in and she didn't. But Richard is trying, in his way, to express how angry and hurt he was for her running away, and what it did to Emily and you really feel for the first time in the series what they felt and how hurt that they were, not just that they were controlling. It's so well written, word for word. The last fight between Chris and Lorelai also really worked on so many levels, as well as the way they part and her conversation at the end with Rory said so much. And I love Emily's attempt to comfort Rory by calling Straub a big ass then really showing she had a loving side.  If I had to pick 5, I'd say

1. Christopher Returns
2. Last Week Fights, This Week Tights
3. A Festival of Living Art
4. Lorelai's Graduation Day
5. It Should've Been Lorelai

For Amy, it's very hard to choose among them.  We've written many things about the best ones. But I'd say:

1. The Big One
2. Raincoats and Recipes
3. Let the Games Begin
4. Nick &amp; Nora / Sid &amp; Nancy
5. A House is Not A Home

Many many I left off the list, but I also know she probably ""edited"" and wrote parts of many of the good ones.

Whilst I agree that Sandee was extremely pushy to get Rory in for an interview I was surprised that Rory didnt bring new ideas to the meeting. A bit strange that she couldnt think of anything to add. 
IMO Rorys look was a bit too casual perhaps for a job interview and added to her thinking that she already had the job and had to do minimal preparation for it.

But I did feel bad for Rory afterwards when Sandees tone clearly changed.

I think that Rory probably outgrew the idea in the middle of high school and pretended that she felt the same way she did earlier for Lorelai's sake. After all, Rory did apply to other schools (more for practicality, though) and seemed to have already decided to attend Yale before consulting Lorelai.

I don't think Rory didn't want to go to Harvard, I just think that she was pretty receptive to the idea of going somewhere else. After all, she accepts Richard's offer to tour Yale, and is only upset about his surprise interview because it was a surprise and she had no time to prepare herself.

Rory is shown to be pretty pragmatic, and she probably figured that attending Yale made more sense, seeing that it was close to home and her grandfather was an alumnus. I wouldn't be surprised if Christopher and Sherry (both of whom she was in a confusing situation with) played a role in her final change; they might have even secured a position on her pros and cons list for Harvard.

Rory might have held onto Harvard, not only for Lorelai's sake, but because it was a fantasy she'd had for a long time. However, as someone pointed out in another thread, she wasn't a fatalist.

Rory only knew him for the better part of a year, yet she seemed as comfortable around him as she did around Christopher when Lorelai and Max got engaged. She even told him that she wanted him to be her stepfather after the breakup. 

I understand that Max was much more parental and openly warm in front of Rory -- but it was quite obvious that Luke saw himself as a father figure to Rory; he refused to let Dean enter the diner after the breakup (I don't think this was sensible by itself, but it does demonstrate how protective Luke was of Rory), he felt proud of her after all her acceptance letters came in, he rid of the mattress she replaced in Yale, and he warned Jess to stay away from her. In fact, one of his first concerns when Jess left was Rory's feelings -- hence his rushing to the house to make sure Lorelai informed her.

Obviously I don't think Rory *had* to see Luke as a father figure. Before the whole Sherry saga, she probably solely saw Christopher as her father, since that's all she knew -- so she likely regarded Luke the same way she did Sookie and Jackson: one of her mother's friends who looked out for her.

But what I was most struck by was her talking about the rumor circulating around the school that she was the gardener's daughter. It provided some important meaningful insight into her character that could've made her much more sympathetic if it had been explored during the OS - it's easy to imagine that she was as popular and well-liked as a child/teenager as she was as an adult by the Stars Hollow crowd, but she didn't. 

Lorelai growing up as a sort of misfit who was (somewhat) bullied and looked down on by her classmates for being ""loud and weird"" and went around saying that she wasn't ""a real Gilmore"" (not to mention the amount of gossip she had to endure after she got pregnant) adds more layers to her character, and it explains some of her issues with her parents - I imagine that the words ""a Gilmore does this"" and ""a Gilmore does that"" were thrown around a lot, and that such combined with Richard's emotional neglect and Emily's critical remarks worsened her feelings of inadequacy and insecurity (issues she carried over well into her adulthood).

Mainly Rory and Lorelai, and how self indulgent they've become...almost irredeemable. I know many people have said the same.

Couldn't finish Winter because Rory pissed me off so much. 

What happened to Rory: the people pleaser, the go getter, the girl with a very strong identity (circa Chilton mainly) and goals. The Rory who was kind to strangers.

I just hate the Paul jokes/how she treated him. A 2 year relationship with a nice albeit bland guy who a past Rory would've been kinder to or at least had better banter with. 
And we're expected to believe she was flitting between London (Logan), NY (barely) and elsewhere (Stars Hollow?) the whole relationship?
Indecisive, rebellious and rude Rory OG
S5-S7 could be excused put down to naivety/age. But even Emily notices... dude, you're 32 now. With no real place to live and no end goals.

Then there's Lorelai and how she embarrassed and hurt Emily at the funeral.

And how she and Luke go to the surrogacy agency when neither of them want that. And a hard to believe 10 year relationship with no talk of kids. If you live with someone that long how does that convo not happen.
Lorelai, you're nearly 50... wtf are you thinking.

Also, she shouldve majored in journalism, I think that would have opened so many doors for her. But Rory was one of those people that doesnt want to go out of their comfort zone too much  just like Lorelai.

**The Perfect Dress** - Feeling that he has missed too much and wants to get to know his newly discovered daughter April (Vanessa Marano, who does not appear in the episode), Luke goes to have a talk with her mother, his former girlfriend Anna Nardini (guest star Fenn). Meanwhile, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) sets a date for the wedding after finding the perfect dress, but she is worried by the nagging feeling that something is about to go wrong. Back at Yale, Rory (Alexis Bledel) happily moves into a dingy off-campus apartment with Paris (Lisa Weil) and Doyle (Danny Strong), and tries to avoid running into Logan (Matt Czuchry). However, when Logan shows up at her apartment and declares his love for her, Rory breaks down.

ALSO it will relate to the revival later on. 


For those that don't remember, ""Partings"" is the episode where Logan moves to London leaving Rory at Yale living in his apartment. Also, Lorelei issues Luke an ultimatum - marry me or we're done - and then she sleeps with Christopher.

Luke had been putting off setting a date for the wedding because he learned about April. Lorelei was inpatient to get married. Luke says he can't marry her on the drop of a dime and Lorelei walks away.

Do you think that's too fast? They hadn't been dating for that long, less than 2 seasons, with an interruption because of Emily/Richard's meddling at their vow renewal.

Issuing an ultimatum seems too fast after that kind of time, and, she had been delaying it herself because of Rory dropping out of Yale.

Revival spoilers, turn back if you haven't seen it.

And then, in the revival, about 10 years later, they still haven't gotten married!? How do you go from issuing an ultimatum after less than 2 years, to being cool with not even talking about marriage or kids for 10 years?

It's on my mind because of something in my personal life, [haha](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/91o7eq/me_and_my_boyfriend_m25_and_f25_relationship/), but I won't get into that here.

Overall I find the revival makes me look too closely at other episodes of the main series. I think I've read this opinion before, but adding April into the mix sort of sets Luke for delaying marriage, and then gives Lorelei an excuse to jump ship so that Luke and ""make amends"" with the season finale.",40,25,False,spoiler,,,,,

I didn't like many of the things he did, but I did sympathize with him sometimes.

Although he could be kind of infuriating at times, I think that the way adults handled Jess was quite unfair at times, considering he was much younger than them. Lorelai, for example, never hesitated to grab the opportunity to yell at him. Everyone probably remembers the infamous instance of her telling him how she wished she had a cream pie to smash in his face. Besides that, she accuses him of stealing Rory's bracelet as a way to come in between her and Dean, she tells him off for being a bad boyfriend, and she confronts him for the way he spoke to Luke. I know that Lorelai was looking out for Rory and Luke, but I think that it's pretty inappropriate of her to speak to someone her child's age as if she were too a teenager.

Luke pushes him in a lake (which I know was supposed to be funny but it was quite harmful), often hits him, and literally gets in a fight with him at TJ's bachelor party. Speaking of which, I think TJ was being pretty brash that night. I understand that he was trying to make an impression on Jess, but who smacks a book out of their to-be stepchild's hands, before beginning to fight with them when they push you away? Jess might have not been very responsive, but it didn't seem as if he'd have much to talk about with TJ and his friends anyhow.

I know Jess was frustrating, but he was also half Lorelai, Luke and TJ's ages. It was weird to see them treat him as if he was also an adult, regardless of how independent he thought he was. It's even stranger than everyone seemed to give each other a pass to treat Jess harshly. I was certain that Luke would feel angry at TJ for fighting with Jess, not pounce on Jess himself.

**Just Like Gwen and Gavin** - Knowing he has let too much time go by, Luke (Scott Patterson) is still unable to tell Lorelai (Lauren Graham) about the existence of his 12-year-old daughter, April (Vanessa Marano), and he is thrown into a panic when April wants to hang out with him at the diner. When April and Lorelai both show up at the diner and begin chatting, April innocently explains that Luke is her father. Lorelai tries to be supportive, even offering to postpone the wedding date, but Luke's reaction to this idea leaves her confused and hurt. Back at Yale, Logan (Matt Czuchry) takes unusual steps to win Rory (Alexis Bledel) back, and the newspaper staff rebels against Paris (Liza Weil) reign of terror at the Yale Daily News. Meanwhile, Stars Hollow holds its annual Winter Carnival, and Lorelai and Rory run a booth featuring their dog, Paul Anka, as a fortune teller.

Nearly getting into a fight with dean who yes is gross but also was a teenager), wanting to kick out women from his diner for breastfeeding, get arrested for kicking Nicoles lovers car, yelling at his sister/lorelai on multiple times.

There's so many reasons I don't even know where to begin. In no particular order (just what I remember first) lets begin.

1) In season 4. 

When Luke moved out of town into that apartment, he didn't tell Lorelai. Honestly, not THAT big of a deal, and Lorelai didn't make it that big of a deal either. But Luke just has a total temper tantrum!! ""You think everything is your business. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU. Well here's a newsflash, some things aren't about you. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU ANYTHING. And you don't have the right to make me feel guilty because I didn't tell you anything. I have been tying my own shoes since I was 4, I have been making my own decisions since I was born, I owe you NOTHING. NOTHING."" wtf man. He's a total brat. 

2) He's Super Jealous.

Look, I get that you don't want Lorelai cheating on you. I get it, alright? But you don't have to keep her from seeing every single guy on the planet. Of course she's going to see Christopher sometimes. Even when they weren't together, he hated Max. If you want Lorelai, tell her. Don't have a hatred for her boyfriend. And if you really don't want to tell her, then stop acting like a bitch that she's with someone else.

3) He's got it out for Dean.

Always. There was never a time he didn't like Dean. Even before he had met him. He has a right to hate him if he wants. But he has no right to interfere. He's not Rory's dad. Speaking of;

4) He thinks he's Rory's dad.

But he's not. He did this waaaaay before he was with Lorelai. He was always trying to mess around in Rory's life, but its not his to change. Just because you hate Rory's actual dad doesn't mean you get to act like her dad. I don't ever recall Rory ever acting like she needed another father figure. She loves her dad. 

5) He was totally messed up with Rachel.

wtf? He knows he has feelings for Lorelai. But he goes with Rachel anyway. Probably to make Lorelai jealous. Rachel got used af. 

6) He doesn't want parenting advice

So he basically forces Lorelai to do all kinds of things with Rory, always giving advice, but Lorelai says one thing about Jess, and Luke goes off on her insisting he's not a jerk. 

7) Breastfeeding women creep him out.

Nuff said.

8) He forces Jess on Rory.

He totally forces Jess on Rory even though Lorelai clearly does not want it. Again, being a dad. Waaaay out of line. He actually states that he wants Rory with Jess because she'll make a good impression. You can't just sacrifice a girls attitude to save your little nephews identity. You can't just take advantage of the fact that she's single.

9) He has no right to tell Lorelai what she can and can't eat.

Look- Ik this one is kinda silly. But Ill say it anyway. Who cares if she drinks too much coffee. You weren't even together yet. You can't just give her healthier food. She asked for unhealthy food, and she's paying for it too.

10) He takes advantage of yet another woman.

He goes and marries Nichole while he's still in love with Lorelai. Seriously?

11) The whole boat thing

yes, she bought your boat. you're a total dick about it, plus you wanted it back anyway. yeesh.

12) He dumps Lorelai for no reason.

She didn't plan the whole Christopher/ Emily thing. They did. Why take it out on Lorelai?

13) WHY TF DID HE NOT TELL LORELAI ABOUT RACHEL

I dont trust him. I don't. This makes me super duper triggered. He just doesn't trust lorelai with anything.

14) He doesn't want Rachel talking to Lorelai. 

If she cut off communications with rory, he'd be pissed. He already acts all over rory,why can't lorelai do the same?

15) He postponed the wedding.

What kind of jerk does this. Im not even going to get into it.

This is only 1/5 of the list. I just can't go on without screaming.",18,0,False,self,,,,,

So I just finished the show like 5 minutes ago. Ive cried and sobbed enough in twitter and irl, and now its time for reddit. I really just want to put down some thoughts.

I loved the final. It seemed... perfect. People had their chance to say good bye to Rory and theyll did a wonderful job to honor her. I was so overwhelmed with the town and the love they have for my little girl. 

It sucks that we didnt really see Rory and Lorelais proper goodbye, though. I was expecting something even more dramatic so I could, you know, drop a few more tears, who would care at that point? I was literally covered in tissues. But all jokes aside, maybe it needed to be done. Or not. But I wish I had had the chance to see it.
I wouldnt change the last scene in the diner for anything in the world though. It was perfect, it ended just as the pilot ended. And Luke was there.

Lorelai is been my top character forever, and really close there was Luke. Ive developed and immense love to this man over the seasons. I was the superior javajunkie b*tch. I waited (as you) for four seasons to see it happen. Weve gone through all the fights and drama but theyre endgame.

Javajunkie are endgame and they kissed to a beautiful song and I just cried again. It was probably my favorite part of the finale. As Rosa said in b99, i just want to see Lorelai happy. And I really do.

Id loved to see Luke give Lorelai Lizs necklace, since he kept it in his pocket and I just thought hed give it to her in Rorys party.

Anyway, this show has meant a lot to me. I started it right after finishing highschool, when I was feeling pretty empty and I had several free time, and it has just filled my life with entertainment and joy. I owe the gilmores so much.

**Friday Night's Alright For Fighting** - While Luke (Scott Patterson) deals with the reality of having April (Vanessa Marano) in his life, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) tries to pretend she doesn't mind the repercussions the new situation is having on their engagement. Rory's (Alexis Bledel) concern over Paris' (Liza Weil) lack of management skills at the Yale Daily News finally reaches a crisis point when most of the staff quits in protest. With Logan's (Matt Czuchry) help, Rory makes a valiant attempt to get the paper out on time. Meanwhile, Lorelai breaks the news to Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) that their money will no longer be needed for Rory's education, and the resentment starts to build. The subsequent Friday night dinner erupts into an emotional confrontation where all four Gilmores finally get their issues out on the table.

1. Lorelai/Richard - I just love the warm moments we get between them. There are definitely still old wounds festering between them that sadly never got resolved before Richard's passing but I adore when we see them let their guard down and enjoy some warm moments together like laughing over Emily seeing Trix kissing a man, shopping for office supplies, him looking proud when she graduated, and letting her sneak out the window when that boring guy was at the dinners. 
2. Luke and Jess- I love how Luke took him in and cared for him when he could have just said no to Liz.  I loved watching their relationship grow from where Jess was aloof and barely saying two words to Luke to slowly warming up to and trusting Luke enough to where they would tease each other.  Underneath that teasing was love for each other and wanting each other to be happy. I love how Jess realized how much Luke did for him and  thanked him and Luke telling Jess he will always have him.
3. Rory and Paris - They were more like frenemies at times but I really like how they became friends and kept up their friendship even in college.  I also loved when they were sitting and talking with Jess about books.  That whole scene was fun. I think Paris was less intense when she was around Rory especially when she felt comfortable enough to let her guard down.  I think she also helped Rory and the competition between them lit a fire underneath Rory.  Also Rory never would have been Vice President if it weren't for Paris so in a way Paris helped her get into Harvard.",16,23,False,self,,,,,

All of the really obvious problems with the pool scene in Summer aside, it just doesn't make sense. For me, Rory and Lorelai having these two little boy (slaves? servants? whatever) just crosses the reality line in the same way the LADB sequence does - lots of crazy things can happen in Stars Hollow, but it's the real world. Crows (ravens?) don't talk and little boys don't hold parasols for grown women who they call ""Khalesi."" I remember an interview with Lauren Graham where she talked about the revival having more of a theater-like quality ... and maybe that's the problem with these scenes. There are expectations set forth by Gilmore Girls and the world in which it's set - the real world. A nutty, quirky real world, but one constrained by real world conditions. The revival switched worlds on us. I read something, somewhere, about this as it related to the LADB sequence, but I think there's more of it to a lesser degree throughout.

**You've Been Gilmored** - Emily (Kelly Bishop) tells Lorelai (Lauren Graham) that she'd like to get to know her future son-in-law better and asks her to invite Luke (Scott Patterson) over for dinner. Wanting to avoid an argument, Lorelai purposely fails to mention that the wedding has been postponed. The Yale Daily News staff finally fires Paris (Liza Weil) and chooses Rory (Alexis Bledel) to be the new editor. A furious Paris kicks Rory out of the apartment, and Rory has no idea where she is going to go until Logan (Matt Czuchry) convinces her to move into his apartment. When Rory gives Christopher (David Sutcliffe) a tour of Yale, he learns of the new living arrangement and tells Lorelai.
