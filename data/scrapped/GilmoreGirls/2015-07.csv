You may think it's a straight forward show, but nahhh... My theory is that this is Lorelai's bizarre dream/nightmare.  She's currently in prison for the murder of her wife/partner, Rory.  Now, before you say, ""C'mon that's preposterous"", hear me out:

In reality: Lorelai and Rory were lovers (not mother/daughter) and in a jealous rage, Lorelai kills Rory via a fire at the Indepdence Inn.  Lorelai is linked to the fire as the arsonist and it's unclear if Rory had been killed in her room by Lorelai before the fire or due to fire. All of the men Rory meets (romantically) on the show, are just friends that Lorelai is suspicious of.  If I forget any characters feel free to ask. 

**Rory** - Lorelai's wife.  Killed in the fire at the Inn.  Potentially bi-sexual and Lorelai is extremely jealous of this notion.

**Luke** - FBI Agent who frequently visits Lorelai at the jail for further questioning.  He is the one who discovers Lorelai did the arson.  He is the lead agent on the arson/homicide case.  Lorelai has developed a crush on him, naturally, because he brought her a coffee one day.  It's unclear if he's got feelings for her as he's got a daughter (April Nardini) and a wife (Anna Nardini).

**Jess** - Bookstore owner.  Good friend of Rory.  He wishes for romance with Rory but understands she is not available.  High school drop out and ex junkie.

**Dean** - Grocery store clerk.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  He is slouch as hell.

**Kirk** - He is Luke's FBI partner.  Lorelai finds him repulsive and annoying.  He's a hard nosed guy who hates b.s. and is a ""by the book"" federal agent.  Luke doesn't always love their partnership, but they are a well oiled investigative team.

**Lane/Zach** - They are the diner owners.  Lorelai/Rory cultivate a great relationship with Lane through the years.

**Mrs.Kim** - Same role only in reality is super nice &amp; is supportive of Lane's choices.  Her husband is alive &amp; very much in the picture.  

**Emily &amp; Richard** - In Lorelai's dream (the show) she dreams of them being more compassionate as time goes on, but unfortunately they are truly conservative jerks who kick Lorelai out at 16 for being a lesbian.  Richard is a slime ball business man who has a cocaine addiction and Emily is gold digging socialite who frequently takes Oxycontin. 

**Christopher** - He was Lorelai's last boyfriend before her coming out.  He has legally adopted Gigi after Rory's murder.  Richard and Emily want nothing to do with Gigi.  

**Sherry** - Christopher's wife who cannot have children.  Gigi is her adopted daighter (via Rory/Lorelai)

**Gigi** - Rory and Lorelai's daughter.  Rory was the one who gave birth to her.  The father is unknown.

**Max** - He is a teacher at the Hartford night school Lorelai attends &amp; is indeed Lorelai's teacher.  He is infatuated with Lorelai but she's obviously not interested.  Much like the show, he desperately &amp; awkwardly asks for her hand in marriage.  That leads to them not talking again.  He's also a crappy teacher.  Surprise.

**Jason Stiles** (Digger) - Lorelai's lawyer.  A total dolt.  His Dad is still a gigantic wanker.  He's a serious alcoholic and makes love to golf clubs.

**Sookie** - This is the prison's head chef.  Lorelai and Sookie develop a friendship and even potentially talk about breaking Lorelai out.  

**Jackson and Michelle** - Prison workers.  

**Logan** - He is Rory's last male sexual encounter.  Never a boyfriend, but he indeed was a rich boy who tried to get Rory to be with him long term.  Rory never truly loves him but appreciates him.  He knows this, because really, he's a little rich brat who hangs out with total douches.  

**Paris** - Rory's crazy ex girlfriend who is vicious and crazy competitive.  Won't leave Rory alone in her new life &amp; is extremely depressed.

**Miss Patty** - She doesn't run a dance studio but in reality runs a brothel.  Truly sad, but we all saw this coming.

**Tristan** - A local bar tender who has flunked out of military school, but hey, dude came up with an impressive cocktail list.  Lorelai love's his Manhattans.  

**Taylor** - A psychologist for Lorelai in prison.  Dude has a gray beard, balding, wears sweater vests, and thinks he knows everything.  Yeah, seems like a psychologist to me.

**Town troubadour** - This is like the ultimate David Lynch character.  He's the equivalent of the little man from Twin Peaks.  He is full of advice but only tells it through obscure Elvis Costello &amp; Yo La Tengo songs.

**Babette &amp; Morey** - Indeed are the Gilmore's neighbors, but they are awful.  Morey plays avant garde piano all night, Babette is loud as hell, and they have more than just Cinnamon (cat who dies in season 1) running around.  They have a litter of cats and this angers Lorelai &amp;.   She dreams of a peaceful and endearing relationship with them.  Her ideal neighbors...cute, quirky, and silly.

**Mayor Porter** - He is completely made up in Lorelai's head.  The town has no real mayor and only sometimes she wishes they had a surly old man (Porter) to act as one.  He's only around for two episodes until his mysterious disappearance.  

**Drella** (harp player) - Fired shortly before the fire at the Inn.  She is the initial suspect in the case and Lorelai believes she can get away with the arson/murder and blame it on the disgruntled ex employee.

**Gypsy** - Lorelai's cell mate.  She's in prison for the murder of a client after deliberately uninstalling breaks in a customer's car.

**Tom (construction guy)**- Stars Hollow Sheriff who is the first on the scene to the Inn's fire.  She finds Lorelai out back in a manic state.

**Liz Danes** - Lorelai's sister who has her life together.  Always treated well by Richard and Emily.  Lorelai has always resented her.

**Madeline &amp; Louise** - Paris Geller's triplet sisters.  Extremely successful business partners who invent a dating website that led to Rory and Lorelai's initial meeting.  

**Lucy** - Rory's first girlfriend and still best friend.  Kirk is cheating on Lu-Lu with her.  

**Brian** (bass player) - Forensic Investigator for Luke &amp; Kirk's team.  Is an extreme online gamer and pot head.

**Gil** - He's Sebastian Bach, but Skid Row is Lorelai's favorite band growing up.  She dreams of a friendship with him.  

**TJ** (Liz's husband) - Owns the Soda Shoppe but it's a front for his illegal bath salt ring.



Alright, that's all I got for now.

In hindsight, I think we can all see that Rory is not nearly mature enough to handle the stress and requirements to be a real reporter. Papa Huntzberger is an expert in his field and nothing he says contradicts what we see throughout the series and he's clearly not malicious. He says she would make a great assistant, which is a very difficult job in that field. That statement is high praise, but she doesn't even listen to him compliment her and instead spirals out of control.

While it's not a real place, I am still working to be a good citizen of Stars Hollow, if that makes sense.

I care about all of the characters - since the end of the show, it feels like I have lost contact with old friends, and I do miss them. Especially Lorelai. This probably means I am a little strange, but part of my heart will always belong to her. And lately I feel like she would be disappointed in me. I have never told anyone this, but when I am working to be a better guy, my goal is to be someone she would be proud of. If I were Luke, I would have wanted to be the best man I could be for her. That thought has (in the past) made me want to be a better man in real life.

Tonight I must admit I am feeling a little down. I wanted to tell someone that I will now be trying harder. By telling you, my fellow citizens of Stars Hollow, I feel like it means more. From this day forward, I will make a conscious effort to be the best person I can be. I may not always be successful, but I will keep trying for Stars Hollow, and for Lorelai.

There are a million possibilities but I think Rory would have still dropped out for the semester, but a united front from Lorelai/Emily/Richard may have gotten her back on track faster. Especially if Richard believed sooner what Mitchum had done. I'm not sure about the engagement. I almost wonder if Emily and Richard would have pushed to get Christopher involved which would have led to a Luke and Lorelai breakup even sooner.

I must know if I'm crazy or if this is real! The Erika Christensen look-a-like is Class of 1992, two pictures to the right of the Class of 1990 one that the camera eventually focuses on. She gets a nice close-up, hard to miss. ",6,12,False,self,,,,,

I'm in the planning stages of a Halloween/Dragon Con costume for my boyfriend and me, and I'd love to do a Gilmore Girls cosplay.

Boyfriend hasn't seen the series yet, but he's willing to sit down and marathon it with me one day.  Should we be Luke and Lorelai?  Kirk and Lulu?  Sookhee and Jackson?  Furthermore, which episode/outfit would you guys choose?

Thanks in advance!",23,20,False,self,,,,,
