A Year in the Life went in on the wrong premise: the appeal of GG was its early freshness, the freshness of its heroines, their youthful mistakes and rare but compelling sparks of maturity.

I think she was making up her mind that whole episode about what to do with the baby, leaning towards being a single mom.

I guess it's because I feel that your teenage daughter should not be your best friend, but now I'm also seeing how toxic this is for their relationship. Lorelai shares things with Rory that I honestly feel she shouldn't, but then disciplines her like a mother once Rory is too involved. 

For example, when they have the termite problem, Rory is present for the whole discussion about how much it will cost to fix and Lorelai's subsequent meltdown over not having the money. This would probably be very stressful for a teenager, but then when Rory tries to take control and help her mum (getting Emily involved) Lorelai pulls the mum card and tells Rory to butt out.

Don't get me wrong, I have and still do criticize the show's characters, and I don't mean to discourage people from shining a light on the shadier sides of their personalities, but I think more conversation would thrive if there was less pure hatred being thrown around. 

Lorelai and Rory both have flaws, I get that.

I'm sure I'm not the first or last to make a post like this, but I just feel like the whole community of this sub would have a better time debating and talking about such a great show if we all held back just a little bit of hate. I know there are things people hate about the show, and there are things that didn't happen the way everybody wanted them to happen, but I'm just happy that I have such an awesome show to watch and a community to discuss it with.

Anna says, when Luke goes over there for the first time, that April ""pieced everything together from my old letters."" For any of these men to have been her father, they would have had to have been in a relationship with her around the same time. And I say ""relationship"" rather than one-night stand or something because I'm assuming the relationships had to be meaningful if there are letters. Even if when she said ""letters"" she meant her own letters or diaries or something, there would have had to have been three men in the picture for April to need to narrow it down, and I'd guess they were significant if she's writing about them and keeping it for over a decade. 

Why was Luke never angry about this? Even after the shock had worn off. Either she was going around behind his back or she ran off and had relationships with two other men in a short time period after their breakup, a la Logan sleeping with the bridesmaids or Lorelai running to Chris as soon as she and Luke broke up. Come to think of it, maybe that's why he was so torn up about Lorelai and Chris that time round....

The revival suggests this life was not 100% what Emily wanted. E.g., her DAR breakdown felt like it had been festering for quite some time.

And what's interesting is that Emily finally finds peace on Nantucket after she leaves the house she shared with Richard and gets a portrait that's less overwhelming; a smaller portrait that takes up less of her life/space and a house filled with children that don't fit into the DAR lifestyle.

I know it isn't confirmed to be his, but all signs are pointing that way. To me this is not only the saddest option, but one of the least interesting. 

One of my favorite parts of the revival before this point was when rory finally realizes that her relationship with Logan is toxic and she decides to cut him out of her life. It was a sign that she was trying to be independent and take back control of her life. Having her raise Logan's baby all but guarantees she will have years of an even more complicated and tumultuous relationship with him. 

On top of being a disappointing character development,  I also think it's kind of boring if it were to develop into more episodes. We've already been there, done that. Do we really need to see more of the huntzbergers? Haven't we had enough of rory's codependence on men? After the revival, isn't it pretty clear rory and Logan aren't good for each other and further examination of their relationship is beating a dead horse? I think rory being pregnant with Paul  (a boyfriend she never truly loved) or the wookie (a one night stand) would be more interesting. It would force her to be more independent and would free her of the emotional baggage of a logan situation.  We could truly see what kind of mother she can be on her own. ASP says we focus too much on the men in rory's life. Wouldn't having the baby's father not be logan be a good way to put the focus solely on rory and her child and not on her relationship? 

I get ASP wanted that FULL CIRCLE ending, but I think a pregnancy would have been enough. Adding logan to the mix is just a boring and unnecessary setback. ",45,11,False,self,,,,,

This is a reoccurring theme when he visits SH and judges Lorlelai's way of conducting business. He is portrayed as a terrible person to work with or for which makes me reject the idea that he was meant to be ""a good person"" after all. When his company is pushing him out of the business, he basically admits that he started the cycle by doing it to someone else. ""I invented phasing out for this company"". The show does a good job of making you feel sorry for him but, really, this is apparently a common practice that he started and it's come back to bite him. Then the whole refusing to pay Margie her current salary but thinking she's ungrateful for not wanting to leave her job... But the Jason Styles storyline was the final straw for me. He had no qualms about destroying this person's career and good reputation (for no good reason since Jason did not actually do anything illegal or wrong) and happily rejoins the company that he was ousted from that caused him so much pain just a few years before? He didn't just decide to end his partnership with Jason but actively goes around town destroying him. Also, when Lorlelai was OK with this turn of events and dumps Jason because she can't date someone that is rightfully suing her dad? The whole I recognize my parents are conniving, controlling, terrible people only applies if it effects random unknown characters like whoever they kicked out of that ballroom for the wedding renewal or Lorelai and Rory themselves is the main lesson we learn from this. It's easy to look at Richard being kind to his family and think that he was a good person after all but being good should extend further than the people you have a blood relationship with and it never did with him.

1) I was never a big fan of Rory, especially during the revival.  I adore Lorelai and all her quirks, but Rory always seemed too much like the golden child.  I hated how everyone seemed to fawn over her.  

2) I was team Logan during the series,but I love what they did with Jess in the later series/revival.  Maybe becuase I'm a huge Milo fan, but I wish they would have explored Rory and his relationships after he had matured and wised up a bit.  

3)I am probably in the minority here, but I actually loved Lorelai and Christopher together. I get that the end game was Lorelai and Luke, but Lorelai and Christopher just had so much chemistry (especially before they finally got together).

I cringe when I hear Sasha use that drawn out Wizard of Oz reference when she meets Jess. Is it too hard for ASP to imagine the existence of culturally illiterate people? I also didn't like how similar Jess's dad was to Luke. And then finding out Jess's mom is kind and warm and maybe just a little eccentric? But this is supposed to be the SAME woman that disowned her son?

And what is with Sasha, Anna (Luke's baby mama), and Lorelai ALL being single moms who just magically popped out these wise-beyond-their-years daughters? Obviously Rory is one thing, but to repeat the concept twice is just lazy and hard to believe.

All these added characters just seem SO boring to me, and they could've had a lot of potential. The writers could have used them as opportunities to tell us MORE about Luke and Jess, or even just add some freshness and contrast to the principals. But instead they just recycled the same old familiar tropes.

My thought process was that Logan has been burned by impulse desicions before, jumping off a cliff, buying a company and losing $3000000, proposing (perhaps not an impulse decision, but a risky move all the same). 

The way I see it, Logan has three choices he can make with Rory:

* Do nothing, and don't be optimistic about Rory and the future. Admit that the likelihood of that relationship is small. You're engaged, she's in a long term relationship.

* Do something. Profess your love for her. It is a risk and you have lost before, but take your chances while you still can.

* Do nothing, but leave plenty of chances for her to say something. You want to be sure that at the very least she likes you back. She needs to take the first step in order for you to truly trust her. 

**DING DING DING.**

With Logan's history of crashing and burning, he would definitely be optimistic about a possible future with Rory, but Rory just didn't take the chance. He was forced to say goodbye to her, and despair over his lost love, who he just didn't take the chance for in fear of pushing her away for a long time, like before. Sure, he wouldn't take a step like proposing, but to an adult in their early thirties, most relationships are hopefully permanent.

I thought he was okay, but never a great character, and now, I just don't like him at all. 
Does anyone else feel the same way?",31,28,False,self,,,,,

I want to see if anyone disagrees or agrees! Either way, I don't mind. It's all opinions!! 

Lorelai: I love her, honestly. She's probably one of the only characters I have very minimal complaints about. That's all, I simply really like her. 10/10

Rory: She's mostly great, but sometimes I feel like she can be annoying. She tends to not realize when she's wrong, for e.x when she slept with a married Dean and when Lorelai (very nicely might I add) told her that sleeping with him wasn't okay, Rory instead ignored her and acted like Lorelai was being rude. She, sometimes, will be a mary-sue, too perfect, with three guys pining for her (not including Marty). All in all, she's a really interesting character, and is definitely smart for someone of her age. 9/10

Lane: I've always loved her, her character is such a non-stereotype. I adore her, nothing else. 9/10

Luke: Luke's okay. He's very noble, and secretly a softie. My heart hurt when he came to Lorelai asking for them to elope but left without her. Sometimes he'll do something, for e.x going to Christopher's apartment and punching him, or hitting the car of his ex's boyfriend(or her car, not sure). Basically, he's not my favorite. 6/10

Paris: What a queen, really. She's so powerful and strong. I wish I had a Paris for a friend, could you imagine the satisfaction once you've won her over. She's genuinely incredible and genuine, and incredibly non-sexist which I LOVE. Seeing Sookie, or Rory (not talking about the guys in this situation) be slightly sexist towards woman without realizing was a pain, but Paris was always around to balance it out. 7/10

Sookie: Sometimes, I love her. Other times, I get annoyed. She can be frustrating, yes, but most of the time when she's frustrating she's pregnant. Not too sure how to feel about that. When she left the kitchen to yell at the man about the iced tea ordering situation, I rolled my eyes. She didn't bother listening. But she was pregnant, so I couldn't even be mad! She's definitely a great friend to Lorelai, but for e.x when she wouldn't listen to Jackson about how he didn't want to redecorate and then she put up taxidermy heads around the house and painted the walls blue + added guns, etc. It got me a bit iffy about her. But anyways, 6/10. 

Dean: Don't even get me STARTED ON DEAN. I liked him at first, he was a great first boyfriend to Rory and a sweet guy, but once he mentioned that he wanted to come home and have his wife cook and clean for him I immediately began to dislike him. When he built the car for Rory, I slightly liked him more, then he continuously got jealous and it was annoying. And then he got creepy altogether! He married Lindsey, then slept with Rory. If someone cheats once they'll be sure to cheat again. It's not worth trusting him. He was definitely not a good boyfriend at the end of the relationship, and not a good guy. 3/10

Logan: Logan started off annoying, incompetent, frustrating, and then he became incredible. He was sweet and tried his best in a relationship. He had a hard time, but really tried, and you could see that throughout the show. The fact that he was even raised with an ounce of decency even though he had parents like that is incredible to me. He continues to be a bit confusing here and there, lacking communicational skills, but is pretty great either way. 8/10

Jess: In the beginning Jess was incredibly rude, annoying and stubborn. I thought I would HATE him. Nope, turns out I was completely wrong. He grew up without a father and his mother was a complete asshole. When he was practically dropped at Luke's place like a bomb he didn't take it well, he had pranks placed around the town, and did stupid things altogether. He skipped school to work at walmart, and then practically begged to be taken back into the school rather than being kicked out altogether. When he went to his step-fathers bachelor party, he read instead of watching the strippers. Later on, he began to grow and change into more of a mature and nice person. Every time he was in a relationship with Rory he would eventually get used or be told ""I still like dean/logan"" poor guy, but he didn't give up so what did he expect. Especially in season 6/7/8 you can tell he's grown as a person and is completely different now. He wrote a book, has a good job, lives in a good area and keeps in contact with the people he likes. He's good. Although, not great, he's still good. 9/10

I know almost everyone hates/dislikes the revival for a slew of reasons but for some of us, the story hit home.

I am the same age as Rory. I started watching the series when I was a teen and like many of her fans, I want to be her. I grew up with the show. She has almost the perfect life I wanted.

November rolls around and since I am a huge fan of the show, I wanted to see the revival. But the bitter part of me did not want to have the reminder of the perfect golden girl who certainly has it all. I mean, how can Rory screw it up?

Imagine my suprise when our shining golden girl has't figured out her life after 30 yrs with all the wealth and the brilliance she has (I wish I have her money and intelligence). 

I pretty much had a great life in my 20s but when I turned 30, a major decision in my life caused bad consequences that forced me to move back home with my parents and lose my job. I was engaged and was supposed to move 5000 miles but it was called off. Moved back home with my folks but I've been struggling with finding a job ever since. I lost the drive or my ""mojo."" I am a career driven person who I thought has her life figured out and just ONE measly bad decision because of a man turned my life around for the worse.

A Year In The Life probably isn't for everyone but for some of us, the show served its purpose. It showed me it's perfectly alright to screw up because you can rebuild your life. The show gives me hope.",40,101,False,self,,,,,

This of course brings us back to her mother, Lorelai's choice regarding Christopher being a part of Rory's life. In the OS, this subject does come up a lot. However it seems to change from season to season. In the beginning of the series, it seems to imply that Christopher only calls/sees Rory very rarely and had not visited Stars Hollow until she was almost 16, which I find hard to believe/understand. Lorelai goes on to tell Christopher that she had always had the door open to him but he had hardly ever used it, implying he was the one not making the effort to be a father to Rory. Later on it seems to imply that Lorelai had made that decision for him, only because he wanted to marry her when she got pregnant at 16 and she didn't find it was the right decision for either of them, having been young and unprepared for marriage. Lorelai decided to have and raise Rory on her own, working as a maid at the Inn she went to later run before opening her own. 

This brings us now to Rory who just recently found out she was pregnant and it seems almost certain that it is Logan's. We do not really *know* for sure that Rory will be keeping this from Logan. We actually don't know if she will be keeping the child, though I do not see her going through an abortion myself. Point blank, we do not know anything that is going through her mind at this point. We just know she knows she is pregnant and told Lorelai this after her wedding to Luke at the end of the season.

A lot of assumptions are made I assume due to the conversation Rory has with Christopher when she asks her father how it felt for him to have experienced her mother raise her on her own. I personally feel Christopher's response is quite the cop out but I admittedly have never been a big fan of his. I am a believer that even IF you do not have a relationship with the mother of your child, it is not the child's fault and it is up to you to make the effort to be in the child's life. Using the broken relationship as an excuse for you not being there for your offspring is petty and childish. But.. make of it what you will.

I see this as Rory weighing out her options not making a final decision. Will she tell Logan? Will she not? Will he decide to be a part of the child's life? Will she ""let"" him? We will not find out unless it is decided for a second season and I am not sure I really want one given that I was not a huge revival fan. But.. it will help us tie up loose ends, so I guess there is that.

During OS Mitchum didn't seem to care about Rory as Logan's girlfriend. It was Shira and Elias who disapproved. Shira threw around words like ""image"" and ""responsibility"" and ""discrepancy"".  In the S5 episode she says, ""this isn't at all about her mother."" I still don't quite get it. Beyond the ""there's Gilmore wealth and then there's Huntzberger wealth"" is part of the angst because she's illegitimate? Elias seems like a constipated old coot. Who knew at all what he was thinking?  Mitchum married Shira who -  was either a debutante or a golddigger Mitchum picked up at a bar (per Emily's narrative). We know Mitchum's a player - he probably cheats on his society wife with women he comes into contact with via his work (he's a busy guy, clocking out at 8-9 pm -where else is he going to meet women?) It's entirely possible the reason we don't know the reason behind the Huntzbergers' disapproval is because there is no real reason - because the writers didn't really have anything in mind and they knew they could get away with fudging it. But I am curious on others opinions if anyone has put any thought into it. Thanks

I'm writing my fanfiction about an imaginary scenario after the revival. I've always read them, but decided to concentrate the amount of ideas in my head. I would very much like to share it with this passionate GG sub.

The story portrays how Rory's life, from Rory's POV, would take place immediately after the FFW and how it impacts her and the people around her, like: Lorelai, Luke, Lane, Emily, Paris, Logan and Jess. I'm trying to represent the characters with the most realistic features possible from the point of view of Amy Sherman Palladino, so be warned beforehand that the characters are dense, complex and very human.

**PS: The story has an essence focused on Team Logan/Sophies, but it is very fair with other characters too.**

I have to say that English isn't my primary language and I'm working very hard to do a good job with it, so I'd really like your input to help me improve, criticism is very welcome.

Please read if you can and give me your opinion, the first 5 chapters are already available.

As you can tell from my username, I'm a Gilmore Girls superfan, and I've been hanging out around this sub for a really long time. So I am HUGELY, MASSIVELY excited that two of my favorite things, Gilmore Girls and [Geeks Who Drink Pub Quizzes](http://www.geekswhodrink.com/) are finally, finally coming together! Geeks Who Drink is holding a huge [Gilmore Girls Quiz on Jan 19th](http://bit.ly/GWDGilmore) in cities all over the U.S.

In case you aren't familiar with Geeks Who Drink, it's a fun pub quiz that covers a huge variety of subjects. It started here in Denver and is steadily taking over the country--for real, we're adding venues every day and, in a lot of cities, having a GWD night is considered standard practice for bars to bring in clientele. I've been a quizmaster for a little over two years, and the quiz is always fun, funny, and just the right amount of hard to make it interesting. They do regular theme quizzes on a ton of different subjects--the Harry Potter quiz, for example, gets bigger and harder every year. I've been pulling for a Gilmore Girls Quiz since before I started hosting, and it is finally, finally happening! Eeeeeee! I'm on the hosting team here in Denver, and I have been participating in a thrilling flurry of emails about how we are going to make the quiz special and fun. There will be costumes, activities, prizes ... basically heaven for any GG fan.

If you are interested in the event, I suggest you go to the [Registration Page RIGHT NOW](http://bit.ly/GWDGilmore) and reserve your spot. It's $5 per person, up to six members per team, and the top teams will win cash money (You don't have to pay in advance--bring cast to the quiz instead). Several cities have already sold out. But, if there's enough demand, Geeks Who Drink might add additional venues or bring the quiz to town in the near future. If the quiz isn't coming to your city, register under ""Other,"" which will help us determine locations for future quizzes. If you don't have enough people for a team, GWD can hook you up with teams who are looking for additional members. And start getting your costumes ready! I'll be posting threads before and after the quiz where people can share their pictures and fun experiences. 

Anyway, I could talk about how excited I am for ever and ever. I hope I've gotten you guys excited too--and if you live in one of the cities where GWD is hosting the quiz, come and join us! Thanks!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Does this line mean that the Palladinos are writing based somewhat on their own experiences? I mean they are married and Lorelai is not, so not that part, but the family parts perhaps. I am not saying you have to always draw on your own experiences to write, there is always imagination of course. But in many cases writers base character and plots on something they have seen or have experienced, or draw inspiration from something familiar. Like J.K Rowling saying that the ""dementors"" in Harry Potter are symbols of the depression she suffered in poverty or Tolstoj hearing about a jilted lady throwing herself in front of a passing train in his village etc. Again I am not saying its not a result of imagination, but they wrote that line and the revival the way they did so it just got me thinking. And I want to know what you guys think. PS ! I know Amy P pitched it based on a town in Connecticut. I am not talking about that part. More the interpersonal relationships and personality of the characters.

Just finished watching Spring and I'm confused by Lorelai's reaction to Rory telling her she's having an affair with Logan, who's engaged. Not only is Rory actually cheating on someone this time (Paul), but she's also repeating her mistake with Dean (who albeit was actually married, but in my opinion it's still basically the same), yet Lorelai doesn't really seem to care. She had strong opinions on it years earlier, but acts like it's no big deal this time. 

I also didn't like how she didn't seem to care that her daughter, whom she had just left a few hours earlier and was supposed to meet her back at the hotel room, just decided to go out, get drunk, and have sex with a complete stranger whom she went home with. I get that this kind of thing happens all the time, but most don't tell their mothers, and said mother's don't usually say things like ""it's about time"" and it's just really bizarre to me that Rory just decided to go have sex with a stranger in a wookie costume while her mother is waiting for her back at the hotel. 

I'm really hating the revival btw. Something is just off and it doesn't have the same magic of the earlier seasons of the OS. It's like ASP is just trying way too hard.",70,44,False,spoiler,,,,,

[POSSIBLE SPOILERS],https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5nm9jp/characters_you_feel_got_shorted_over_the_show/,isthiscleverr,1484257556,"We've had a lot of discussion about character assassination and characters in the revival who got the short end of the stick. While I will argue you to the death against Rory and Logan's character assassinations, I started thinking about OS characters who really got screwed over the course of the show not because of screentime or even plot, but out and out character assassination. 

The biggest examples I have are Liz and TJ. When we meet TJ, he's a quirky, strange guy, but he's far from dumb. He's smart enough to recognize that Luke harbors a lot of resentment for his sister that Liz either ignores or isn't aware of, and TJ tries to make sure Luke is nice to her. He's also sharp enough to realize that, when Luke gives TJ his ""approval,"" that he doesn't really need the jerk brother's approval. (I say that with nothing but love!) Two seasons later, he's dense as mercury and basically the court jester of the show in all the wrong ways. The last good episode is their wedding episode. The tights obsession is hilarious, and he shares some sweet moments with Liz. But it seems as soon as they're married, he comes back and he's so thick and stupid. The ""escrow!"" bit annoyed me, though it was just a transition to the truly stupid side of TJ. The contractor deal was what tipped it for me. 

Even Liz suffers from this, though less egregiously. We meet her and she's this hippy dippy woman who is far from a Stepford homemaker, but again, she wasn't stupid. Fast-forward to season 7 when Luke goes over to their house for dinner and both Liz and TJ *completely forgot that their kitchen appliance did not even work.* Not just forgot to turn it on -- which I know I've been guilty of -- but completely forgot that they never fixed it. For HOURS as they're trying to cook their tuna loaf. There are other examples, as well. It's like she can no longer relate to a normal human being; she and TJ are the only ones who understand each other because they're equally dumb.

It's fairly obvious that she models Rory and Lorelai after herself in some ways. For example:

1. She is incredibly smart and witty and makes tons of pop culture references in interviews, etc.
2. She posed both Rory and Lorelai with hats in not-so-subtle scenes in the revival. She is, of course, famous for her hats.
3. She's made a few references over the years in interviews that strongly imply that she sees a lot of herself in Lorelai. Because Rory is a writer, I've begun to wonder if maybe she sees a bit of herself in Rory, too.

As a show gains popularity, creative directors tend to feel more comfortable putting more and more of themselves into the writing, etc. (Even actors do this. That's why characters often feel ""off"" in pilots but gradually feel like real people.) So I'm wondering if ASP modeled Lorelai and Rory's decisions and stories in AYITL after her own experiences. Maybe she had an affair like Rory or couldn't get her life on track by her 30s. Maybe she struggles with immaturity like both women do at times. Maybe she makes fat-shaming jokes IRL and saw nothing wrong with the girls doing that, too. 

I've just noticed that, as the show goes on, I dislike Rory more and more. I like Lorelai, but she seems to have lost the spark she had in the early seasons. I wonder if this could be why. Maybe she's not writing characters anymore. Maybe she's just showing herself through the lens of the show.",4,36,False,self,,,,,

Rory has a girl named Fanny, based on a character in a book she was reading. Fanny is raised in Stars Hollow, and loved to dance so Rory put her at Miss Patty's Dance Studio where she fell in love with dance and competing. At the age of 15 her great-grandmother Emily Gilmore passes away. She, Rory and Lorelai are all very upset by the news. Fanny starts dancing for a competitive team. About 10 years later Rory develops a tumor and passes away. Lorelai dies a few days later from a broken heart. Super upset by losing both her mother and grandmother, Fanny moves to California, and takes a break from dance for a few months. There she meets a guy falls in love and gets pregnant. The guy runs away and Fanny is left as a single mom raising Hubble by herself just like Rory did to her and Lorelai did to Rory. Once Hubble grows up, Fanny opens a dance studio in a small town, similar to the one she grew up in, in California. As Fanny starts becoming in her 50s-60s, she basically starts looking like Emily Gilmore did when she was that age.

Some thoughts:

April says she wants to go to Germany. Lorelei pulls Luke aside later and asks how April is going to pay for this and suggests maybe she get a job. I'm sitting there thinking, did Rory ever get a real job for her trips to Europe? Rory was given a lot of things and I don't remember her working much. Maybe Lor realizes mistakes were made with her spoiled ass daughter, so she hopes April won't have the same fate, but I doubt it. Besides, I'm sure whatever degree April got from MIT, will be much more useful than Rory's expensive Yale journalism degree that she's, up until this point, wasted.

Then we have the pool scene where they both ridicule fat people. I'm sorry but I don't remember them being that mean in the OS. I mean Lorelei's best friend, Sookie was fat. Would they have made fun of Sookie at the pool? Apparently they would have. Also, what was the bit with the 2 kid ""slaves""? That wasn't cute or funny. They just looked like spoiled, entitled bitches at that point. Then the kids were following them around town. ASP has definitely lost the charming, quirky writing and just went for plain bizarre in my opinion. 

Then the oft mentioned musical. I was ready to hate it b/c I'd read about it so much, but it was the only part of the episode I found amusing to be honest. I was confused by Lorelei's reaction to it though. Seems like in the OS she would have loved this play as something to openly mock with her friends(like Kirk's movie). 

Let's not forget Rory's being ""broke"" yet looking at rentals in Queens, jetting back &amp; forth to London for what seemed like several times a week in the Winter &amp; Spring, having like 4 or 5 cell phones, etc. 

Then the ending with Lorelei telling Luke it's time for her to go Wild, b/c if not now, then never. I mean seriously WTF? This revival has jumped the shark. I'll watch Fall just to finish, but I truly wish this horrible revival had never been made. ASP ruined her 2 main characters IMO.",32,55,False,spoiler,,,,,

I don't know if anyone made that kind of post already; I have read a few comments about this topic, but after all this time it still bothers me so much. I know some of you guys think Jess is an underrated character and that he isn't special and I respect your opinion, but nevertheless, I really hated what the revival did to Jess. That look on the end where you can predict he's still in love with Rory (yes, I've heard the paralel theory) is just too much for me. After 10 years and an ending which was: you, me, we'll never be at the same place kind of talk, he couldn't get over her? Really, writers? If you like him or not, he's one of the characters that has actually had some character development, and yes it was because of Rory, but when we see him at the end of the OS, you can see he made it on his own, so I don't get why a character who has actually grown, is now responsible and is the most different from when the series introduced him would be still stuck with a girl such as Rory, which showed character back-development (if a word like that exists) and would be a horrible match for what is now Jess.

Spoilers for everything.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5ohunr/im_a_guy_who_lost_a_bet_with_my_sister_and_had_to/,walmartsucksmassived,1484657058,"Long story short, she's seen this show a bazillion times and I always ragged on it while it was on in the background. I made a bet with her that if she watched Supernatural, that I would shut up and watch this. Well, she did, so I had to follow through.

Note: this is mostly dumping on the characters. That being said, I actually did enjoy the show a lot. Even though everyone on the show has some pretty deep character flaws, none of the said flaws felt particularly contrived and had some decent narrative justification.

Lorelai is justified in a lot of her resentment for her parents. That being said, her parents are also justified in a lot of their resentment for her, and both parties seem to go out of their way to earn it several times over the course of the show. It's a toxic relationship and it honestly would have been better for everyone involved, including Rory, if she never went back to them to ask for money   to send Rory to Chilton. I was really hoping the therapy angle would play out, as both she and her mother need a lot of it. She can be a bit histrionic at times, which is really annoying. While I understand her desire to not be like her parents, there were a few times she should have been more in Rory's face about some of the shit she pulled. Her behavior throughout season 6 really pissed me off. I'm glad she ended up marrying Luke, but he's probably the only one who would be willing to deal with her bullshit.

Rory sucks. She's boring and has no real personality in the original series. Maybe that's more on Alexis Bledel instead of the writers, but I was bored to death whenever she was on the screen. She's a lot better in this regard in the revival, but unfortunately she becomes a terrible person in the process by banging Logan, (who is engaged), while not having the willpower or any real desire to break up with her boyfriend for a whole year. I could understand her indiscretion with Dean as an emotionally driven mistake that would serve to be a good learning experience, but they doubled-down on her homewrecker status in the revival and now she's pregnant with Logan's kid. Rory - 2, marriage - 0.

I was Team Logan all throughout the OS. He was mostly level-headed, unlike Jess, and wasn't a doormat, unlike Dean. I honestly really hate that they made him a cheating bastard in the revival. Sure, he's a bit of a womanizer, but he always seemed to take his commitments seriously, but he sucks now too. He and Rory should adopt the kid to Michel and his husband. 

Dean, like I said above, was a doormat with Rory. He was a really sweet guy at first, but he had some security issues that came out a bit ugly. That being said, Rory was completely insensitive to that, (which makes sense, since she was still a kid), and he made the right decision for himself to dump her after she started hanging around with Jess behind his back. Unfortunately, due to said insecurity, he got hitched at 19 to a girl he barely knew and ended up cheating on her with Rory. The bastard. Still, I'm glad he got his shit together by the revival. They really missed an opportunity to have him picked up in a '67 Impala by a cousin named ""Sam"" played by Jensen Ackles. I also couldn't shake the ""Sam Winchester"" vibe, since I saw Supernatural long before this.

Jess was a douche at first and the scene where Luke pushes him into the lake is my favorite in the whole series. Also, the goose that attacked him is my favorite character. The way he just took off without saying anything to Rory was really shitty, but he ended up turning out okay in the end. That being said, I feel like he never would have gotten there if he didn't leave in the first place, so it's a bit of a wash. He's a good example of how the right thing for ourselves can fall in a grey area and sometimes end up coming at the expense of someone else.

I HATED Paris at first. Always so obsessed with perfection and status. After her breakdown in which she ends up borderline homeless, she becomes much more likeable, although considering she started at zero, this isn't saying much. She's textbook OCPD and while I'm glad she made her way in medicine, Doyle made the right choice by divorcing her and I hope he gets full custody of their kids.

Lane was the most relatable character on the show for me. I grew up in a similarly religious and restrictive family and it was a bit cathartic to see her play both sides like I always wanted to, but was never able. I hope she and her band blow up and become huge because they're all cool dudes that deserve it.

Luke was probably the second most relateable, since he seemed to echo a lot of my sentiments about the show as it went on. Always calling out Taylor on his bullshit, making sideways remarks about how ridiculous everything was all the time, etc. Luke could be my homeboy in real life, I feel. That being said, I think he needed to smoke some pot and chill out a few times in the OS. Fortunately, he seemed to have found the hidden pot farm near Sookie and Jackson's old place and made good use of it between the OS and the revival.

Michel was insufferable, but I always felt like that was more a reflection of his surroundings. One of my favorites.

Kirk was always entertaining whenever he showed up. I hope he and Lorelai become therapy buddies. Not because it would help him, but because the idea is hilarious in my head.

I'm surprised Taylor hasn't ""gone mysteriously missing"" by now.

Sookie was really one-dimensional, but not bad. As a foodie, I enjoyed her food inspired rants and her spats with Jackson about veggies.

All in all, this was a good show. I enjoyed it a lot, and I'm glad I watched it. That being said, I don't really want to see it again. It would be too exhausting.",29,152,False,spoiler,,,,,

And the entire Odette situation is so frustrating!!! Rory acts like it's nothing for her and Logan to cheat continuously on Odette, who I'm 99 percent sure has no clue what's going on and probably thinks Logan is COMPLETELY loyal to her. 
I could tell Rory would continue to cheat seeing as she cheated with Dean on his fiancee (right? they weren't married yet?) and it's just so frustrating to see such an incredible, yet very mary-sue-like, character go downhill like that. Her character got annoying, she dropped all her good job opportunities in season 7, and that was that, she lost everything.

Welcome to my secret head-cannon.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5onq1z/i_told_myself_i_wasnt_going_to_do_this_but_i_need/,pseudo_meat,1484719777,"I'll try and keep it brief because I'm not partial to walls of text myself. But one thing that really bugged me about the revival was that Luke and Lorelai didn't have their own kid. And I don't mean their own too-late in vitro baby with a surrogate. 

I was sad to catch up to the two of them almost ten years later--their communication problems notwithstanding-- and they never accomplished something we knew they both wanted.

Lorelai admits she wants another kid in 6x22 to Jan from the Office in the car after FND. And we all know about Luke's Twickham House desires.

So when the revival catches up to them, I would have loved to see them with an eight or nine-year-old kid. 

The kid is a boy. He's NOT precocious (unlike every other child on this show). He's just a regular, normal kid. Nothing special in his dialogue for the most part. He's a mini-Luke.

After Lorelai had her mini-me for so many years, now Luke has his. And Lorelai--though she loves her son dearly--struggles to connect with him because he doesn't like TV, he likes to go fishing with dad and play sports. And doesn't really get her witty banter. He's amused by it--like Luke. But can't or won't participate.

Maybe there's even a scene where Lorelai is jokingly accusing Luke of hoarding their son's affections and he denies this, saying their son is just as much Lorelai as he is Luke. And at that exact moment, their nine year old son says ""damn it Taylor!"" and Lorelai deadpans a look to him.

And this is in addition to all of the grieving and Inn-related stuff she's already going through. Her and Luke never got married because they got swept up in raising their son and figured that having a child together was good enough. So it make their lack of a wedding make more sense. And it makes their eventual wedding more meaningful. Like 'hey, I know we BOTH know we're not going anywhere--we have a kid together--but let's get married anyway. Let's have a wedding for US. Because we've been through so much together and I want to spend a day celebrating that with our friends.'

Also, it would be neat to examine how Lorelai feels finally raising a kid with someone else. And having to take another parents wishes into account. How does she struggle with that? And how does she find comfort in it too.

Honestly I think them not having a kid was a huge missed opportunity and it made it hard for me to enjoy rewatching the OS. Knowing they never made the decision to be parents together, not because they couldn't. But because they ""never got around to it"". Like how you never get around to asking your husband to empty the dishwasher and then he's away for the weekend. It's not believable or satisfying.",32,173,False,self,,,,,

The first episode or so would cover the investigation, with the story being published at the end of the first episode.

Something you somehow missed and then when you noticed it, it was ""Wow! Of course!""

#1) During ""Friday Night's Alright for Fighting"" (S6, Ep 13) during the Friday night dinner - Emily and Richard go off on Rory for leaving Colin and Finn alone in the house to move her stuff. Emily points out that two picture frames are missing. Rory defends C/F saying they wouldn't steal Emily's picture frames. I don't know how I missed it - of course they did! for that LDB ""steal from the rich, give to the next rich"" game they play. [Side note: I also thought it was hilarious how when Rory moves in w/ Logan, Logan sends C/F to pick up her stuff. I guess it's partially due to the fact that Finn has the HUGE Escalade - but seriously those two wouldn't be the ones I'd think of when I have manual labor that needs to be done. I also think its great that Logan doesn't do any of the actual moving himself. He's totally the Godfather of the group.] 

#2) One one of the AYITL threads someone noted Logan had a guitar in the background - did he take up playing while in London? During S6, Ep 14 - about 21 mins in - Logan's in his apartment and a guitar is clearly visible behind him. So whether or not he ever plays, he's been carrying that thing around for years.

But theyre also six terrible hours of television. They tear up and throw out just about everything good about the show that the fandom relished, in service of a thoughtless artistic vision ripped from crappy early-aughts movie musicals. Its hard to even believe how bad they are.

 The set has disorienting differences, mainly of scale, and much of the camera work is genuinely ridiculous. It looks like half of the series was shot from the angle of a security camera, and the other half was shot with hand-helds in extreme close-up. (Often peering directly up someones chin, Mr. Robot style.) 

The draw of the series setting, Stars Hollow, is that it feels like a place that might exist if we werent too mired in our current dreary lives to go search for it. It looks like a real town, operates like a town, does everything a town normally does, except that snow falls on cue, and everyone there is super-charming. The new Stars Hollow is revealed as a backlot facade when Rory and Logan decide to stand on top of one of the fake roofs during a incredibly long, Baz Luhrmann-y steampunk musical sequence soundtracked by The Beatles With a Little Help From My Friends, the rights to which must have cost a small fortune. 

Netflix has a reputation for giving its content creators complete freedom, so its retroactively clear that the family-friendly constraints of Gilmore Girls primetime network days actually helped the team rein in some gaudier impulses. 

The new episodes are also clogged with long, expensive setpieces that add nothing to the plot. The introduction of a Stars Hollow musical is just an excuse for Broadway darlings Sutton Foster and Christian Borle to show off for 20 minutes.

There are some dark elements in the show like how Rory lost her virginity or how they dared the main cast to be seriously flawed at times (selfish). I think the deepness of the characters in combination with smart dialogue and the comfort made the show genius, unique. 

I believe that Amy planned to end with pregnancy. As a matter of fact, I believe she wanted them both to become pregnant in season 7. The song is about full circle etc. and the revival is full of clues about stories that would've been part of it but didn't fit anymore 9 years later. 

But she ignored how comforting we felt the show was. She went darker already in season 6 which gave backlash back then. If she wanted to tell a tragedy, she shouldn't have made the humour such a prominent element and sadness subtle, hidden in small moments. Because that's what she wrote all those years. With all the dark, cinical shows out there now that are widely popular, she maybe felt more free to be more cinical. But since the show started happy and felt happy for a long time, you can't erase that! It's the fabric of the show. 

And you know what, the older the show gets, the more uniquely genius it is that tragedy was in small moments and small stories were blown up (new traffic light), it made it stand through time and also makes it rewatchable. I wish that Amy could see, appreciate how amazing and different that is and is why it stands out in a good way. But the revival seems like ASP hold onto her idea that was set in stone that she wanted the show to be more cinical, the comforting aspect be damned. For me, the entire point of the show was that Lorelai tried to prevent Rory from making her mistakes, giving her everything she could give her and Rory trying to become her own person, finding her groove and learning to become more comfortable with the way she differs from Lorelai, because she did look up to her and wanted to be like her but couldn't because she had Christopher in her as well. Amy apparently saw that completely different which confuses me immensely. This is the reason I pretend the revival didn't happen honestly.

ASP must've known how fans feel about the show. Her explanation about life never wrapping things up nicely in a bow, tells me that she can't appreciate that her show became the warm blanket while it should've been cinical, more reflecting of who Amy and Dan are. I love cinical as well, give me cinical jokes in Gilmore Girls any day, but please Amy, I hope you'll understand that few people can write happy people on TV and keep it interesting! You can which is a big trait! It's genius and sadly, with the revival, you told a story that you wanted to tell and not the story you should've told.",12,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

He was ostracized from the family by their mother, Lorelai ""Trix"" Gilmore, when he fell in love with and married a woman from Waterbury, CT, whom their mother did not approve of. Cut off from the Gilmore fortune, the couple moved to the Boston area and worked lower middle class, blue collar jobs. Richard's brother became an avid hockey fan, like many of his new peers. He and his wife had a single son, who grew to love hockey as much and more than his father did. Unfortunately, as the years wore on, hockey became an obsession. So much so, that Richard's brother's bride from Waterbury filed for divorce, and moved to Egypt to get as far from a hockey rink as possible. Things soon worsened for the family when Richard's brother was killed when he was struck in the head by an errant hockey puck at a Boston Bruins game. With his father gone and his mother half a world away, the boy was sent to live with his maternal grandmother in Waterbury. She greeted him at the door in a Gene Simmons mask. That's right. Richard Gilmore's nephew, Lorelai Gilmore of Stars Hollow's first cousin, is Happy Gilmore. 

This theory makes sense chronologically. We know that Lorelai Gilmore was 16 when she gave birth to Rory in 1984, meaning she was born in roughly 1968. Happy Gilmore rose to prominence as a professional golfer in the mid-1990s, likely in his early thirties, placing his birth no more than five years before his cousin Lorelai. 

As you may recall, Trix Gilmore also did not approve of Richard marrying Emily, instead wishing for him to marry Panolin Lott, but realizing the mistake she made in cutting her older son off from the family begrudgingly tolerated his marriage to Emily. 

Finally, Richard Gilmore, an avid golfer himself, would often watch golf on television. He was also hopelessly devoted to his mother and no doubt shunned his own brother in accordance with his mother's wishes. Following his second heart attack, he began watching old golf matches on video in his bedroom. Feeling philosophical and perhaps regretting his estrangement from his late brother, Richard was watching tapes of his nephew, Happy's matches, wishing he had reconnected with his brother when he had the chance.

Working off the ground laid during S5-S6.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5p5hq9/os_discussionspoilers_my_theory_on_the_season_7/,MiralW,1484935490,"I've debated a bit on the premise of why exactly the Huntzbergers disapprove of Rory. (See previous post - https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5n8olb/why_do_shira_and_elias_huntzberger_disapprove_so/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=GilmoreGirls

**Elias** -is a stodgy old coot. Her status as illegitimate is probably enough for him to disapprove of her. 

**Shira** - probably sees Rory as similar to the working women that Mitchum routinely beds (i.e., a threat). Rory is not a vapid socialite that Shira will enjoy shopping with and generally being vapid with. 

**Mitchum**- has been my question mark. I did not see him as caring about the above. But the question is what does Mitchum care about? What Mitchum cares about is keeping Logan on his leash. So, would Mitchum have perceived Rory a threat to Mitchums control of Logan? 

- Logan demonstrated that he'd blow off Mitch/work for Rory (Valentines Day). 

- Then there was the internship. Why did Mitchum give her the internship in the first place and then tell her she didn't have ""it""? Did he mean it? Was he lying? Was he being extra harsh to prove a point? Maybe he was testing her mettle. Maybe he wanted to see if his slam would break her. It did sidetrack her. But then she returned to school. Got back with Logan and they were going stronger than ever after the Costa Rica accident. 

- She called Mitchum to b*tch him out about not visiting Logan in the hospital. 

- She tried to get the NYT reporter to write a retraction on Mitchum's interview where he insinuated he gave her her ""start."" (It was never picked up again but it had to mean something. Had ASP been around in S7 it probably would've come up again. Mitchum probably would've found out and likely been pissed. ""How dare she embarrass me?!"") 

- Finally, there was Rory and Mitchum's exchange on the elevator during Partings. He says sending Logan to London had nothing to do with keeping Logan from Rory, but maybe he lied. He said it was to get Logan away from Colin and Finn. Yes, they were his playmates but were they the real threats? Logan was their ringleader. They did what he said. Not the other way around. Mitchum using the ""dopes"" as the justification was a brilliant manipulation. He knew it was something Rory couldn't disagree with. It appeased her and got her on board with London supportive enough at least to not ask Logan to stay. 

So lets say Mitchum knew the only one aside from himself  who had any real influence over Logan was Rory.  And Logan asked Rory to ask him to blow off London. He probably would've stayed had she asked. Or at least delayed going. Mitchum probably knew that. Not that Logan asked Rory to tell him to stay, but that if Rory did ever tell Logan to stay, he would. (Follow?)

So thats my theory. Mitchum perceived Rory as a threat to his ability to keep Logan under his thumb. The S7 that didnt happen wouldve followed up on this. How far Mitchum wouldve gone to separate them wouldve been interesting to watch. The 4 words back then  under those conditions  wouldve been so, so different.

Now the way S7 played out rendered the above scenario as no longer viable. Hence, AYITL had to gloss over the Rory/Mitchum power struggle with murky, sinister ""dynastic plan"" references.  Regardless, it's fascinating to consider the season 7 that might've been.",3,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

I was re-re-rewatching the old seasons in search of new visions regarding the show. In season 3, a thing bugged my brain.

I already thought it was absurd before, but seeing it again, I realized how repetitive the script is and how some fans have selective views about their favorite characters. 

The season two transition shows a passionate Dean (with many flaws, of course) being sentimentally crushed by Rory because of the new and interesting Jess. Jess knew Rory had a boyfriend, he also had a girlfriend, whom he happened to treat like crap, and yet they kissed and were completely emotionally involved behind Dean's back, who was being ridiculed in front of the whole city. They took that shame on, until Dean couldn't play along with  that crap anymore and then Jess dismissed Shane  immediately like a trash. At this time, I remember, almost everyone wanted Rory to leave the ""boring Dean"" and stay with Jess.

The public has forgiven (or never saw) the real meaning of this terrible storyline. 

I know that many will use the age argument to justify the difference of this case to Logan/Rory, but I am not sure If 18/19 YOP  isn't able to realize that cheating is wrong. I agree that it is an age of immaturity, but that doesn't forgive the fact that it is an immense lack of character and cheating is always cheating no matter what.

Of course I'm not saying that everybody in ""team jess"" agrees with this or that people who like him are hypocritical, but I would like to know why people ""forgave"" Jess, and why people usually say that the affair ruined Logan, like he is lost case. As I remember, we can find a lot of ""reasons"" to justify both boys's bad behaviors, but deep down is almost the same thing, and Rory is a cheater in both.

The only sure conclusion I draw from this story is that people close their eyes to their fav character's huge moral flaws and ASP has a distorted belief that everyone is a potential cheater when properly tempted, and that character is relative in her eyes, then she creates dubious reasons to romanticize cheating and make fans argue until their fingers bleed. I would believe that Rory has magical lady parts, but then I realized that Rory isn't the only cheater, but also Lorelai, Paris, Logan, Dean, Jess, Christopher, Emily and Richard.

So, I ask you sincerely, why are Dean and Logan the only ones, besides Rory, to get all the huge moral hate in the fandom these days?",20,10,False,spoiler,,,,,

*Lorelai references ""the enemy.""* Rory: ""oh Republicans?""

And, Rory ends the season as a Barrack Obama campaign reporter. 

I do think it's interesting that although Lorelai is the clear protagonist of the show, she and Rory could never get by without the financial help of her  Republican parents (high school tuition, college tuition, termite house damage). Isn't that society? The hard working lower class relies on the tax dollars of the hard working upper class (to some extent). 

Lorelai's unconventional life (running away from home, little education, starting a business as a single parent) is frowned upon by her traditional Republican parents. This kind of mirrors the non-traditional liberal values (transgender rights, gay marriage) being frowned upon by Republicans. 

Richard and Emily's strongest values are tradition, family, education, and social status. Lorelai's strongest values are independence, freedom of will, freedom of speech, and her and Rory's happiness.

I hate this false savviness that she seems to have that in my opinion doesn't correlate with her character at all. She's never had a proper job before and yet suddenly fits in so well in her internship, with the DAR, and with her community service. 





I find it intensely annoying seeing this sudden change between a nervous, out of place Rory at first and then suddenly out of nowhere within what seems to be a day, seeing her gliding around in and out of others conversations, dispensing one-liners and patronising lines of advice/reminders to colleagues. For example when the other community service worker who she had previously had a fight with just 20 minutes of episode time prior, is asking for Rory's permission to have a cigarette to which she responds 'NO we agreed, not until the end of your shift.'
Or 'Is that bag half full or half empty, Jules? Ohh, you're making me an optimist, my friend!;)'.




It's at these points where I find her the most irritating. Especially given how she has no prior experience and yet walks about like she the owns the place and seemingly has developed a strong working relationship with all of these people out of nowhere.



I find it even more maddening than Digger's character. Who to me just constantly felt like he was trying to feign charisma - despite being extremely dull.

So far, Jess had been reduced to a couple of concepts here:

*Who is better: Logan or Jess?

*Who is endgame for Rory?

And to be honest, this is a really limiting way to look at Jess. Yes, he was one of Rorys boyfriends, but unlike the other two, Jess always served a greater narrative than this.

For a start, Jess is the only one of Rorys love interests who has storylines outside of Rory. He is not defined by his role in Rorys life and it is confusing to me why he should be solely defined by that here. Jess has narrative importance to other characters in a way that neither Dean or Logan do and I plan on breaking that down here.

**Rory**

Jess role in Rorys life goes far beyond that of boyfriend. Yes, when they are teenagers, they are mainly defined by this aspect of their relationship, although the key themes of their later relationship are laid here in how they consistently believe in each other and want better for each other. However to me, their final scene in Season 4 is the end of Jess mainly being a love interest. When Jess is reintroduced in Season 6, he has a far greater role in Rorys story. He is less potential love interest and more the character to bring Rory back from the rabbit hole she has fallen down. For me, this is the beginning of Jess being the person who grounds Rory when she needs it the most. Hes instrumental in getting her back on track. A role that continues in the Revival when he pops up in Summer when Rory is showing some classic signs of depression (self destructive behaviour (the affair, the interviews, the Wookie), procrastination, lack of motivation or clarity about herself). Again, as Rory threatens to float away, it is Jess who comes in, lends a sympathetic ear and gives her some much needed direction (although I am with Jason Manzoukas in that I wish Rory had come to the conclusion about what to write about herself. Jess could still plant the seed to show the narrative continuation as the person who grounds and centres her).

By the end of the Revival, Rory and Jess relationship is something much more than romantic. He has become someone she can always rely on regardless of what their relationship status is. He is that friend who you might not see for for 4 years but you can instantly pick up the threads with and get to the crux of your problems. They are always going to be part of each others lives and not just because his uncle is married to her mum but because they are important to each other. Important at believing and motivating each other. This is highlighted by the fact that Jess is the only boyfriend to not get a goodbye scene with Rory. Their parting in the Revival is very much a see you tomorrow and the week after. Unlike Dean or Logan, you are left with the feeling that they will chat regularly about the book and each other.

**Luke** 

*Alternatively titled: I have a lot of feelings*

Even when Jess was mainly a love interest for Rory, he was also narratively something more. In fact, it is Luke who introduces us to Jess and has the first scene with Jess - not Rory. This is important. It says this character is not only here to be the third side of a teenage love triangle, hes also here to add layers and depths to the main male character. And Jess continues to do that throughout all his appearances on the show. We get a beautiful and complex relationship between Luke and Jess that starts as antagonistic and full of misunderstandings only to culminate at the end of Season 4 with that scene between them where Jess is finally able to (semi) verbalise how much he needs Luke and Luke is able to reciprocate and tell Jess that he is always here. From that moment, every scene between them is mutually supportive and even more beautiful. Their next scene in 6.18 highlights just how far they have come from 2.05. Luke knows that Jess is finally on the right path and Jess now has a healthy headspace where he can express his appreciation for everything Luke has done.

Jess is also present at potentially the most important part of Lukes storyline - when he gets together with Lorelai. Jess is narratively built into that storyline with both the self help tapes and also in helping Luke pick out his tie (which Lorelai compliments). This is no accident - this is because Jess is narratively important to Lukes entire storyline overall.

Then in the Revival, we see a little bit of a season 4 role reversal. Luke is the one turning to Jess for advice. Jess is the person Luke can be honest with when his communication with others is failing. The revival scene in the diner beautifully parallels the one in Season 4 when it is Luke dishing out the self-help advice to Jess. They have become relatives who can rely on each other, who can speak honestly with each other and prop each other up when necessary and that is a beautiful beautiful thing.

**Lorelai**

Yeah, I can see the scepticism on your faces right now. This is less the importance of Jess on Lorelais narrative. Although he does have some in that hes the first major roadblock between her and Rory, which signals how Rory is growing up and away from automatically accepting her mums opinions on people/events. Its therefore quite ironic that Jess plays a major role in bringing Lorelai and Rory back together in Season 6. But anyway, I digress.

Instead, I am putting Lorelai in this because this subreddit has an obsession about who Jess is meant to parallel: Luke or Christopher. Obviously, this is not limited to this subreddit as ASP herself has spoken at length about who is meant to parallel who out of the boyfriends. Nethertheless, Im here to put forward a third option. Jess neither parallels Luke nor Christopher, he most closely parallels Lorelai. We are even told this during their first ever scene together in 2.05 when Lorelai tells him that shes already been there and done that - and in heels!

So heres my breakdown in bullet points as to why they parallel each other:

*Lorelai and Jess both have a penchant for running away from their problems. Lorelai from her parents when 17 and again from her wedding to Max in 2.04 (and no we never got confirmation of whether she told him or not!) at age 33. Jess from Stars Hollow when 18.

*Both are taken in by mentor figures at the age of 17 who help them grow as people. Lorelai has Rory by this age so she is quicker to buckle down and appreciate her breaks than Jess.

 *They both use humour as a defense/deflective mechanism. Lorelais humour is more outlandish and Jess is king of the biting sarcasm.

*They both drop out of high school before graduation. Lorelai because she has Rory and Jess because he has no academic interest.

*They both have different but deep seated parental issues. Lorelai with how stifling she found Emily, Richard and Hartford high society and Jess with abandonment (Jimmy and ultimately Liz) and neglect (Liz).

*Following on from the above point, they both have issues with authority figures. Jess are more pronounced when we first meet him with his I hate everyone attitude and because hes still a teenager, but Lorelai is just as rebellious in how she rejects what is expected of her as a Hartford Gilmore.

*They both manage to build a life for themselves away from familial support in completely new cities/towns. They also both run independent businesses.

**Conclusion**

So in conclusion, my premise is that this subreddit stops thinking about Jess purely in terms of whether he is endgame for Rory or not, better than Logan or not, and starts thinking about his larger impact on the narrative. Because they are bigger than the number of his appearances suggest. After all, he is part of the second family of the show - the Danes - and was introduced as the second character of that family. It is also clear from the character arc we do get for him, that ASP initially had much bigger plans for Jess as shown by her desire to spin him off into his own show and that she initially planned for him to be a series regular from seasons 2-7 but Milo Ventimiglia didnt wish to sign for that long.

I also want to end this ridiculously long post on a plea. Please dont turn this into the very thing I set out to reject at the beginning: whos better: Logan or Jess. If you are going to comment along the lines of x, y and z about Jess are all the reasons why Logans a, b and c then please dont! This isnt a post about Logan. Go and make your own post about Logan and feel free to title it Rethinking Logan. Thanks.

Someone suggested that we create a separate topic if we want to talk about Logan too. So here it is. First I'd like to say that this is not an anti-Jess topic, so please feel free to controvert my ideas, add other, and talk about Jess here, this is the reason that all we're here in the first place, to say whatever we want politely.

I'll synthesize some of my personal ideias and how I see this loved and hated blonde character, that as well as Jess, is what makes him so fascinating.

**Second**, I would like to say that I believe that the palladinos leaving the show was fundamental to make Logan so ambiguous. This is what I think Logan would be if ASP had the chance to finish the story in 2007:

As we know, the last time we saw Logan and Rory by the hands of Amy, Logan is leaving to London and Rory is broken hearted. Let's consider a scenario where she follows the course of her own history normally. At the beginning, Rory and Logan would struggle with their feelings until reach an agreement that they should stay in an open relationship to reduce the potential emotional damage of the situation, when deep down both would still have concrete feelings. Logan and Rory would run into each other often trying to hold themselves onto the comfort of what they had,  trying to ignore the fact that the time and the distance were exercising their power and fading their relationship and their importance to each other. Rory would feel the impact of losing Logan as her safe place while he would become increasingly attached to his work and they would have one last night of crazy love and lust to give a closer to their story, because Logan eventually would give in to his heir ""destination"" and succumb to the lack of motivation that Rory's abssence brought to his personality and marry some heiress he didn't love. Rory would end up pregnant anyway, but the story would suggest that she decided to raise the baby alone because both would be living in different worlds, leaving a bitter taste in our mouth and this would be the perfect parallel between Logan/Christopher that ASP wanted.

Meanwhile, Jared and Milo were playing a role in hit shows and probably wouldn't be there, suggesting that Jess had closure with Rory in ""The Real Paul Anka"" when she told him she was in love with someone else and Jess gave that acceptance look respecting Rory's choice and letting her go.

BUUUUT,

ASP quit and got bitter for 10 years about her story and create this scenario after all this time is a little unreasonable, but stubborn how she is, she probably thought: ""Damn It, let's adapt this and make my perfect end because these are my characteres and I'll do whatever I want with them, but first I have to sell my show, because you know, 10 years later people lost interest in this, and I have to seduce them back and of course, Netflix isn't doing any charity spending an obscene amount of money in my project, they need to sell signatures and have media attention, so I will call some friendly faces with dead purpose in the story such as Jared, Melissa (who doesn't care about GG anymore), and Milo, even If he only filmed one pilot in the whole year, I will give him such an small role, like 4 freaking scenes, and I'll use almost all of his new material to promotional matter just to make people believe he is huge in the story to catch audience and create strategically an atmosphere of nostalgia on my product, later I will complain about how much people care about the boys just to make more sensacionalism about my show and make more people watch for curiosity.""

Saying this, here is the **Third** thing. The original Idea wouldn't work It out, cause she would treat us like idiots, so she made some  adjusts in the story's context, like:

No one would believe that an yummy and rich man like Logan would be exclusively stuck to Rory specially after the ""end"" David Rosenthal gave to them. So she put Logan and Rory already in some relationship to give a good reason to the public accept their downfall quickly in 4 episodes and finally give them closure by her own hands without losing the opportunity to leave Rory knocked up by having sex with Logan like a bunny. 

So what's the point of this second ridiculous huge post here? Only drop another argument over the other topic and show another possibility about how Jess and Logan work for ASP, outside our feelings. Maybe they aren't really independent characters without Rory or really deep how we want to believe or a real heritage to her, she probably only cares about Lorelai and Rory, Emily second.

My point is, I think we all can sit and reach a consensus on the boring Dean in a few minutes, but we will never agree on Jess and Logan completely. While some will continue treating Jess as Holy phoenix, others will continue thinking he is a dangerous rapist. While some will treat Logan as the coolest guy of the world with his birkin bag power, others will continue accusing Logan to be a supporter of Trump with cheating satanic problems.

But let's be positive, maybe a next season will gift us not only with one, but two scenes of a shirtless Matt and a naked front Jess bathing. Just kidding.

ASP If you're reading this and I'm crapping by my fingers, please just DM me to relieve the shame.

PS: Guys, don't take this topic that seriously. :)

Lane/Jess: Love the look Lane is giving Jess here. Totally would be here for Lane and Jess to hook up and take that back of the classroom pen conversation up a notch. Plus imagine the hilarity of Mrs Kim and Jess as mother and son-in-law. And it would rescue Lane from Zach (I am all for rescuing Lane from Zach - sorry any Zach fans).

Emily/Logan: Those totally look like heart-eyes Logan is shooting Emily and I. Am. Here. For. It. The show obviously had no issues with relationships with a large age gap (hello Paris/Asher Fleming) so I would be totally fine with Emily having some post-Richard fun with the handsome Huntzberger.

(REVIVAL SPOILERS),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5qik4f/thoughts_on_a_third_rewatch_revival_spoilers/,isthiscleverr,1485539797,"Just a few weeks before the revival aired, my husband decided he wanted to watch the entire OS. So we got to work, but we only made it to about mid-season 2 by the time the revival arrived. So we watched the revival, then we continued chronologically in the OS. (In the meantime, I watched the revival again one weekend while he was away.) Last week, we finished the OS and capped it off with the revival for a third time (for me -- a second time for him). Here are my thoughts. ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5ex3hd/revival_spoilers_beware_my_feelings_and_boy_there/) is a post I did on my original thoughts on the revival immediately upon finishing it.)

- Winter and Fall are definitely the standouts, with Spring as a fairly close second place. Summer is the weakest of them all. The 30-something gang still grated me a bit, but really only because it was so overdone. They took what could have been an okay joke that also served to show how Rory viewed herself as somehow ""better"" and beat the dead horse until he fell. 

- Rory's and Logan's arc still feels very interesting and right to me. It was always in Rory's character to kind of implode like this professionally. Each time I rewatch, I see her floundering in a myriad of different ways, and it makes just perfect sense. I still like revival Logan better than OS Logan (though my husband had the opposite reaction). 

- Lorelai has always come across as the strong, independent woman who knows herself and what she wants. What I'm realizing now more and more is that Lorelai is actually, and has always been, a very insecure person. This could probably be an entire post unto itself, but Lorelai is strong and she is independent, but she's also very affected by what others say or think of her. She is actually deeply insecure, and that's really her main struggle in the revival: her insecurities that her friends are leaving her in the business, that her daughter has grown up and moved on (and later failed and returned home, possibly indicating her own failure as a mother), that her parents are aging and dying and she's had such a rollercoaster relationship with them. But, more than anything, she's afraid that what she's always believed to be comfortable happiness is actually her settling for less -- that she's peaked. Even the ""communication issues"" between Lorelai and Luke really stem from this insecurity rather than their problems as a couple. I feel like I understand Lorelai so much better with rewatching the OS and revival all together.

- I think I understand better why Lorelai and Luke never married. Throughout OS, one of the things Lorelai wants most is a partner, a husband. It's a strong theme throughout the show and culminates in two engagements, a wedding, and a divorce before finally getting with Luke in the season 7 finale. So, what if her marriage to Chris finally had Lorelai realize that marriage isn't really the important part of a partnership? Her finally getting married and then so quickly and disastrously divorced really dissolved her desperation to be married. She finally realized that it wasn't about having a ceremony or a ring. It was just about love and trust and partnership. So, when she and Luke are finally together and get their rhythm down, she doesn't feel that burning desire to run to the courthouse. This was one aspect that really irked me (that she'd wanted so badly to be married then waited a decade before doing so), but I excused it because we got her magnificent midnight marriage. However, I wonder now if it actually does make plenty of sense. 

- Surprisingly, the musical number has grown on me. Perhaps it was knowing that it was coming and knowing how long it would take, but I didn't find it nearly as horrific as I did the first two times. (The Hamilton ripoff was still too on the nose, however; the other songs were all fairly cleverly subversive, while this was just a literal, ""Hey, we're ripping off Hamilton, aren't we awesome?!"") 

- On that note, I still think the ""rewrite"" song that spurred Lorelai to California doesn't fit. One of two things should have happened: 1) Either the song should have been Sutton performing at the Secret Bar, where Lorelai hears her when she goes to drink alone after fighting with Luke and Rory and Michel getting ready to leave (this would have made way more sense and given Sutton's character a bit of validation as an actual artist). OR 2) It could have happened the same way, but there should have been some sort of significant glance or visual exchange between Lorelai and Taylor. 

Hear me out. 

Taylor writing this song and adding it to the musical makes no sense -- it in no way fits with the other songs, and not in a ""mismatched"" kind of way, but in the sense that two entirely people with two entirely different tastes and levels of skill and purposes in mind seemed to have written the bulk of the musical and this final song. I actually commented on several threads about my headcanon that Sutton should have been performing it at the Secret Bar. *However,* the way Taylor reaches out to Lorelai and asks her to come listen feels somewhat important. She was the only person who hated it -- why is he even bothering? Then when she arrives, this song is obviously Lorelai over the last 16 years to a t. It *is* her and seems to perfectly encapsulate her character's struggle at that very moment. Plus, the entire time, Sutton seems to be singing directly to Lorelai, at one point even raising her hand and motioning to her (seemingly), and her eyes never seem to waver from Lorelai. So, what if Taylor *did* write this last song, but he wrote it *to* Lorelai? As in, he's seen her struggles for nearly 30 years and has come to care for her (as a friend, obvs), and seeing the difficult time she's having now (perhaps the first really difficult time she's had in a very long time), he wants to reach out to her some way and adds in this song. Maybe he didn't know how to tell her that she would be okay -- Taylor isn't particularly known for being extremely thoughtful, though he has had moments of genuine care and kindness -- but wanted to convey that sentiment to her? So he and his writer dude write this song -- which so very obviously is based on Lorelai and so very obviously is not meant for anyone else -- for Lorelai, to comfort and inspire her in her current struggles? The only thing this scene needed to make this work was some indication that Taylor meant this song specifically for Lorelai. Hence, one meaningful glance exchanged, or even a shot of Taylor watching Lorelai hear the song, would have worked. 

Granted, it's got some holes. He seems a bit perturbed when Lorelai walks in late, and why would he gather all of the other committee members? (Except, if he was trying to subtly reach out, perhaps that makes perfect sense). Either way, this is how I reconcile that scene in my head. 

Overall, I still think the revival scores a B/B+ on my scale. I am excited that I seem to be enjoying it more each time I watch it, and I know not everyone has had that experience. I'm thankful I'll be able to continue appreciating this for years to come, just as I have for the OS.

**Ravenclaw** - intelligence, creativity, learning, and wit

**Slytherin** - ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness

Lorelai - Gryffindor 

Rory - Ravenclaw

Richard - Ravenclaw

Luke - Hufflepuff

Sookie - Hufflepuff

Lane - Hufflepuff

Good or bad


After weeks of reading reviews and thinking it over,  I've come to a conclusion about Rory/Logan in the revival. I wouldn't want another man fill Logan's shoes.



They were messy as all get out and there are so many things I'd change about how ASP handled them, but if Rory must go down this route, my pick would be to unequivocally Logan to accompany her. 



In a twisted a way, the affair with Logan in the revival could only make sense with him and no one else. They'd be no reason Rory would carry on with a random engaged man who lived a continent away, whereas with Logan, I can come up a myriad of them. The heart of which I personally felt were love, safety and familiarity. If it were another man, she'd be purely selfish but the shared past with Logan makes it more than a cheap affair. 



She could've gotten the last 2, comfort and familiarity, anywhere but Logan was the only one she could have all three. 



While I've liked them through the OS, there was added intensity in their scenes in the revival which was possibly because they knew they were on borrowed time?



Matt and Alexis played up Rory and Logan's love for each other more convincingly than some of their scenes in the OS imo. That is why, as much as I disliked the storyline, wouldn't switch roles for anything in the world. It is bittersweet and the way they ended, I can convincingly say that they'd be settling with anyone they end up with in the future.

The more I think about it, the weirder it gets. The whole tone of the series seems quite liberal. There are themes about acceptance, education and independence.

But as she gets pregnant fairly young, there is no mention of abortion. No talk of it. Not even once. Here is a girl that is evidently completely unprepared for a child and does not want one (!!!!!), starting out her life. But everyone just keeps telling her that she'll be fine, and I'd think with the show's general progressive attitude there would at least be a discussion. There is nothing - nada. And the more the storyline progresses, the harder it gets for me to watch, because I feel like they are portraying a girl who clearly, really, absolutely does not want a child right now and is being passively forced into it by everyone else around her. (And I get where they're going: *her life will change. She won't regret it. She will have beautiful twins. Yadda, yadda.* Not the point: She. Does. Not. Want. A. Child. *That* is the point.)

Then there is their attitude towards sex outside of marriage/serious steady relationship - the writers are clearly against it (Logan and the 'casual sex', Lane can't have sex not married and even then doesn't like it, Lorelai's freak out over Rory having sex with a married man).

I wonder what would happen if they made Rory pregnant and made her choose between her child and her prospective carreer. But we all know that wouldn't happen.

And then I thought, there was never any talk about it. Maybe the show's values are actually more conservative, but masked like something progressive and pro-women. At this point I got sick of that storyline because it was making me depressed and I stopped watching. I know it's just a TV show, but I feel like they've tricked me somehow. I am slightly disgusted. /rantover






Edit: an excerpt from an article I really agree with [SPOILERS IN LINK]: http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13793244/gilmore-girls-year-in-the-life-ending-feminism-discussion

**""Theres an unspoken assumption throughout Gilmore Girls that everyone wants to be a mother, planned or (usually) unplanned. Weve seen this happen with Lorelai, Sherry, Lane, Paris. Gilmore Girls has always been about mothers and daughters, but women are not defined by motherhood. Nor should they be.""**

I just finish the OS for the first time, immediately followed by the revival. Holy moly, do the romantic relationships in this show make me uncomfortable!

Rory and Dean. Rory and Jess, for a little while. Rory and Logan. Rory and Paul. SOOKIE AND JACKSON. LUKE AND LORELAI. Lorelai and Christopher.

Rory and Dean, Sookie and Jackson and Luke and Lorelai in particularly really get to me. It's not so much that their relationships are controlling and full of insecurity, because I get it, that happens. It's that this is kind of a model for an ~ideal relationship~ in GG land and it's touted as like... romantic. Honestly, other than Babette and Maury, which isn't delved into too much, the way ""meant to be"" couples on this show treat each other makes me cringe. 

And Sookie and Jackson, with all the lying and the vasectomy and not respecting or listening to each other's feelings about more kids? It's supposed to be cute, but it's totally not to me. 

That could just be me, projecting from years of an unhealthy marriage onto a poor, defenseless ten-year-old TV show. But yuck. I wanted Luke and Lorelai to get together for so long, and when they did, their relationship was nothing to look up to, and it didn't get any better in the revival. 

And Rory and Logan in the revival? Gah.
