She makes them pizza. They eat the pizza on fancy dishes by candlelight. And you can hear classical music in the background. 

The piece is ""batti, batti o bel Masetto"" from the opera Don Giovanni by Mozart. I felt proud that I recognized it. Please recognize and bow before my genius. I needed to tell someone. 

Also, do you think there may be any significance to the choice of music beyond just sounding right?",0,1,False,default,,,,,

And where else have you found plots line up where there are fallacies? This is the only one I've found with Gilmore Girls--other than that, I'm fairly impressed that the show remained true to its cast and plots over the long stretch of its primetime existence and despite its change in behind-the-scenes staff.

I think Rory became a much more dynamic character with getting into trouble, moving out, fighting with Lorelai, leaving and returning to Yale, all her meltdowns, etc.  I loved seeing a lot more personality and Alexis did a great job. 

I thought Lauren's best season was season 4 with buying and building the Dragonfly and the lead up to dating Luke.  Truthfully I don't think Lauren ever had a bad season but that stands out on my mind and is the first time I really felt Lorelai was who she was.  ",2,21,False,self,,,,,
