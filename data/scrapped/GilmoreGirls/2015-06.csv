VERY LONG POST,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/3act2j/what_do_you_imagine_the_gg_movie_to_be_like_if/,boohookitty,1434678305,"Mine would be like this:

Rory is living in New York- she works at the NY Times as a journalist.

The Dragonfly is still going strong - Lorlai and Luke are now married and have twins- just like Lorlai's dream!

Anyway- Rory is woken up at 3am and is told the sad news that Richard has passed away suddenly. Understandably she's very upset and she rushes back to Stars Hollow to be with Lorlai and Emily.

The plot will basically go along the lines that Rory is pregnant- but as her marriage is basically falling apart she doesn't want to tell anyone yet.

 Luke wants to stop working at the diner and Jess has come back to think about turning it into a hipster coffee joint- something Luke is vehemently against. He hates the fact Jess put free wifi in the place- but hey- you just need to move with the times.

Emily seems to be dealing with Richard's death pretty well, she's organizing the funeral and busy bossing everyone about. When Lorlai tells her that its ok to be sad- she tells Lorlai very rudely ""like you would care- you barely visited in the last 10 years since Rory left. We barely knew our other grandchildren!"". Lorlai gets mad and tells her this was her own fault- she never approved of Luke and they refused to come back from Europe for their wedding.

Turns out Lorlai got pregnant quickly by accident and she and Luke had a shotgun- but still happy- wedding. Emily goes off about how ""it wasn't enough that you refused to marry Christopher when you had the shotgun marriage but you needed a SECOND shotgun wedding! Did you not learn your mistake from last time!?"" Lorlai get mad that her children are called mistakes and storms off.

Rory has to tell people she was pregnant when she found out the Richard willed one of his super expensive super old whiskeys to her and everyone is pressuring her to drink it- for Granpa's sake.

She rushes out the room- Lorlai follows her as does Emily. Emily doesn't see the big deal because she is married to (insert bland young man's name who is a lawyer) and things will be ok- but Rory tells her they are getting a divorce. And then Lorlai sadly says ""just because they take all the right steps, engagement, marraige- wait two years and then baby, doesn't mean its right""

Emily doesn't say anything but sits down in understanding and puts her hand on Rory's shoulder. 

One of Lorlai's twins walks over and is talking like such an little old man and he smiles at his grandmother and says ""Well then Emily, shall we go into the dining room"". Emily whispers ""He's just like his grandfather (Lorlei can't help quipping ""except for the whiskey and cigar habit...we think"") but Emily starts to sob and asks the boy twin to keep talking because she wants to keep hearing Richard talk because she will never talk to him again. 60 years of marriage and she will never talk to him again.

In the end- Rory moves into her childhood home- Luke and Lorlai live at the Dragonfly. Rory will commute to New  York two times a week but be able to work from home other days. 

Also insert scenes of Rory and Jess sort of getting back together- obviously not going to while Rory is pregnant but promising to revisit the opportunity in about a year.

The very last scene is Rory and Lorlai walking up to Richard and Emily's house. Emily opens the door and asks why they are here. Rory says ""its friday night isn't it?""... emily lets them in and says ""good thing i prepared for this"" and the dining table is already set - places for everyone- Luke and the children included.

They all sit down for dinner- background conversation -Rory mentions she is having a girl. Lorlai smiles and says ""another Gilmore girl""
