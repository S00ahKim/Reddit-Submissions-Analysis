That's how he is perceived by other characters, he's always referred to as this great kid who cares so deeply about Rory. However I don't see him like that at all. He is crazy jealous of almost everybody Rory is in contact with, Tristan for example. I was just watching episode 2x16 where Rory has the house to herself and wants to do laundry and eat indian food. First he disapproves of her need to be alone for a night and later he calls her, doesn't take no for an answer and forces himself on her. I feel like he is like that all the time, he doesn't listen to what Rory wants or needs at all and always pushes his way through. I find it highly surprising that this is supposed to be the depiction of a great relationship. He constantly loses his temper and gets frighteningly angry and he justifies his oppressive behavior with nice gestures, as if they entitled him to something in return.
Furthermore, to me it seems as if Rory is such a sweet and caring girl that she can't stand up for herself. In these situations like the one in 2x16 she can't counter his attacks and feels guilty although she did nothing wrong. That never matters to anyone and everybody watches her jump through hoops to make up with him. I find that really disturbing because it always seems to be about his feelings being hurt, never hers. Dean indulges in his jealousy and Rory caters to it. Does anybody feel the same way?

Like if, after Jess's introductory episode, instead of Rory asking Dean to look out for him, Dean just kind of met Jess at school and started hanging out with him and at first Rory's just like, ""Oh hey, cool. My new friend and my boyfriend are hitting it off. Maybe I can get some studying done now that Dean's got someone to hang out with.""

Like if they had kept Dean the way he was in the first season, and toned down early Jess's douchiness a bit, I could *easily* have seen them getting along. You know, bonding over being new kids in a town where everyone else seems to have known each other forever. Bonding over both being fairly mechanically inclined (Jess managed to fix Luke's toaster, for example, so he must have had some interest in how stuff works) and having similar tastes in books.

It could have made for an interesting foil to Rory and Lane's dynamic.

Plus, think of how much more awkward it would have been for Rory, developing an attraction to the first really close friend her boyfriend's made in Star's Hollow. Or for Dean and Jess, watching this really solid friendship slowly deteriorate because they both like the same girl.

It also adds a lot more emotional heft to Jess and Dean's conflict in the latter half of season three, and Jess's struggles to live up to Rory's whole idealized ""perfect first boyfriend"" vision of Dean.

The OC used to do that really well: Ryan and Luke, for example, eventually developed a friendship despite both being into Marissa. Summer and Anna were still friends even though they both liked Seth. Seth and Zach were buddies while Summer was with Zach. Marissa and Teresa (and Marissa and Lindsey) got along even with Ryan in the middle.

It all revolves around them. 

Luke. Their main problem with him was that he wasn't rich and wasn't from a family like theirs. They didn't care that he loved Lorelai and Rory, that he wasn't a bad person, that he was an honest hard working person. They sure as heck didn't care that Rory and Lorelai loved Luke. The Gilmores wanted Luke gone because he didn't have blue blood. This becomes obvious when they ""accept"" Luke and start planning the diner chain so that it won't look so bad. You know, their daughter dating a common person looked bad and embarrassed them in their society. So they push Chris. It doesn't matter that Chris makes Lorelai miserable, it doesn't matter he was always a shitty dad and hurt Rory time and time again. It looks good on the Gilmores. To the point where Emily goes to Lorelai and basically tells her to tough it out even if she is unhappy with Chris because ""that's marriage"".

Dean. Jess. They were also simple boys. The Gilmores didn't know their faults but they immediately judged them and rejected them. Conversly, Tristan who did nothing but torment Rory, was immediately deemed a good friend by Richard because he was a DuGray(however you spell that). Logan was a dream come true because he was a Hunzberger. I am willing to bet Emily would have told Rory to put up even with physical abuse just to keep Logan because he was Logan dammit. 

People keep saying that the Gilmores send Lorelai to the best schools and so they wanted the best for her. No, they wanted their daughter to fit in the same pidgeon hole as all their friends' children. They didn't care what Lorelai wanted. She was to be a good student, well mannered girl, married to some guy like Chris or Logan and be a DAR member because that's what reflected well on the Gilmores. It was never about Lorelai and what was best for her, no matter what Emily wants to claim. Her first thought was always: ""Oh God, what will the world think of the Gilmores?"" I'd go as far as to say they had Lorelai because it's what you do. You have a kid(at least). It's another societal expectation.

I'm sure there's plenty more examples, maybe someone else wants to contribute. If you disagree, I want to read that too. I'm not saying it's all black and white and they didn't love Lorelai and Rory but it wasn't in a healthy way, my point is. They were toxic people(Emily especially) and Lorelai wasn't crazy to want to cut ties.

Jess is new to town, a young underage boy, obviously has had a rough time, and all people want to do is bad mouth him before he even gets to town without getting to know him. He's staying with a stranger in a strange town because his mom sent him away, and they expect him to be all cheerful and have no hint of an attitude when it's obvious that the whole town is against him and no one likes him? He barely did anything wrong besides have sarcastic humor and pull some pranks. Luke for the most part tries, and that's why over time they develop a good relationship, because Jess can actually trust an adult in his life for once. And I'm getting REALLY annoyed at Lorelai. You could tell when she tried to talk Luke out of letting Jess come she already had a negative image of him in her head, and she never tried to change that. From their first conversation she was giving him a hard time. Yeah, he's having a beer and has some attitude. It's not the end of the world. Then she has to pull her patronizing routine, not thinking that maybe what she went through with her parents is totally different than what Jess has gone through with his mom. And after that she never gives him another chance. She's always talking bad about Jess to Rory and Luke, calling him bad and messed up. Acting like Jess isn't good enough to fix her roof. And then the way she treated him over Rory's bracelet? Okay, maybe he took it, which she has no proof of. He obviously returned it when he found out she was upset. He obviously didn't mean to hurt anyone, and is just a kid with a crush. It's not the crime of the century. For all she knows, he found it. Then she calls him, a TEENAGER, a ""little jerk"". How can she not have any compassion for him? And don't even get me started on the way she treats him after the car crash, like he's the only one that could ever happen to. She can be so cold and cruel to him for no reason. She obviously doesn't want him anywhere around her perfect family (lol perfect yeah right Lorelai and Rory have plenty of issues themselves). Ugh, I love Lorelai, but she can be so wrong and mean and immature. When Rory asked Jess why he was only nice to her, he should have said because she's the only one who's nice to him!

Kevin and Demi have their own sort of dorky charms to them and they have a good back and forth / on set chemistry which is nice to see.

However, as much as I do like Kevin, he does get under my skin a lot more often than Demi has (which I don't think has even happened yet), mainly about the Anna Lore thing? I get that not everyone loves that ep, but Anna was fun; they've had worse / uncharismatic guests. I get Kevin's POV to be frustrated with them being off topic, and maybe it's just because it was early on which made him feel pressure to meet a level of quality that he imposed on himself, but the way Kevin was acting was really unprofessional. They could have had an off the record talk like ""hey, guys, can we please stay on topic?"" instead of getting increasingly annoyed and gritting his teeth but trying to play it off like he's in on the joke.

I honestly feel awful for Anna Lore because Kevin kinda treated her like garbage while she was on, and continually bad mouths her on air which is really hard to sit through (iirc she even apologised a few times during the episode? It wasn't like she was dismissive or cussed out Kevin). It's nice that Demi is quick to call Kevin on his shit, but it sucks that despite that he still jumps at every opportunity to rag on Anna.

I find it pretty hypocritical that Kevin got hung up on getting off topic and not discussing the episode in 109 when there have been episodes where they miss some segments entirely, go minutes on end at the start without even discussing the show, or do bits of their own- all approx. the same level as the Anna thing. The show barely has any structure at this point, and they get so off topic they even have a jingle / catchphrase to get them back on topic now.

It seemed more like Kevin was getting upset that he was becoming the third wheel on his own show than it had anything to do with Anna being a distraction. And his jokes about her in later episodes are really... juvenile, I guess? Like, mean and obviously pointed, but played off in a ""oh, I'm just kidding! It's just a joke!"" way.

I didn't mean for this to become a big pro-Anna post, but most of my complaints about the show lead back to 109.

Does people really think that having a very open relationship with your parents, or have your parents constantly commenting on your life is remotely close to ""obnoxious, creepy, unhealthy..."" (list goes on)?

I wanna know if this is a common idea in American culture. I have many American and European friends, but in my country it's totally unlikely that anyone will actually cut off relationships with their parents or spend more than two days without calling them even when we are adults. It's also extremely unlikely that people will spend holidays without their family or move away from home too early.

Here people usually always try to be physically close to their familes and Rory-Lorelai and Jane-Xo relationships are very common indeed.

Yes, it was an extreme portrayal at times, but something about it hit close to home. Her guilt, her struggle to find her own path, her loyalty and love for her mom which only reinforces the guilt she feels for being a ""bad daughter"", living a double life.. It was amazing watching her slowly take steps towards standing up for herself, giving in to fear at times (purple hair experience comes to mind), trying again and expressing her needs, and finding a way to live her passion of being a drummer. It was amazing to see! I was so attached to her and her story. I especially loved how even when she moved out and asserted her independence, she still in a lot of ways feared her mother, respected her, and yearned for her approval (like when Mrs Kim was visiting her in her new apartment for the first time). That's so so realistic, speaking from personal experience. 

I guess it felt underwhelming when she got pregnant from her first time. Sex was also very taboo in the Kim household, and I would've loved to see her explore that side of herself, be more empowered, enjoy her sex life. Why did they have to make her pregnant from so early on? Why was abortion never an option? It felt like two steps forwards, ten steps back. She was on her way to living a kickass life with her husband, being a rock n roll couple, going on tours, and all of a sudden, it all disappeared. She was again doing her best to please her mom, and in a lot of ways, it was like the ""empowerment"" she went through didn't really happen because she ended up living the lifestyle her mom wanted for her in many ways. (The only difference being, Zach wasn't a Korean doctor.)

I get that pregnancy is a realistic thing that can happen to anyone, but did it really have to happen on her FIRST time, when she thought sex was awful and terrible? Did it have to seal her fate as someone who had to stay home and raise the kids? I can't help but be disappointed. ",26,12,False,self,,,,,

I keep holding onto the thought that AYITL fell flat because of the time lapse. ASP was in her element with the OS of GG but inevitably, after the show ended life moved on. Pop culture, fashion, political correctness (the pool scene, anyone?), the cell phones (considering the revolving door of cell phones the GGs had in the OS I can't see them with smart phones) have all changed with the times. We had such high expectations for the revival of the show that was a landmark in the early 2000s that updating it in any way felt... I don't know what the word is... bad? 
Lorelai moved to Stars Hollow as a means to separate herself and her daughter from the life she was born into. She wanted to avoid becoming a product of the elite but she couldn't shelter Rory from it as much as she tried. As a result, Emily and Richard fawned over Rory because she was the daughter they didn't get, she represented everything that Lorelai didn't exactly want to be and everyone knew it, including Lorelai who in occasion pointed it out. 
Rory became a product of a life that she wasn't meant to have. She went to a private school, had a coming out party, had a trust fund, got into several ivy leagues and had countless opportunities most of which provided by her grandparents and THAT is why in AYITL it felt, at least to me at first, like a blatant character assassination. She was perfect, groomed to be successful by grandparents and her mother (and an audience) who only meant to love her, but inadvertently grew her ego to the point that when we do see her flaws and we do watch her make mistakes that seem out of character, we too become disappointed. She wasn't built to handle falling from grace because when she did, it looked forced. 
The Rory we see now is a result of seven seasons of that. Someone who readily makes mistakes but is not accountable for them. Someone who has been given a lot to the point it's just expected. 10 years is a long time to evolve and I think Rory just never did given her vast amount of privilege from seven seasons prior. 
I had a lot of problems with AYITL and it took me about a year to kind of just accept it for what it is. But I don't think it was bad due to laziness or shitty writing.

For me it's: 

-- Kirk having a new job every episode. I don't get the appeal of the schtick. 

-- Sookie's flakiness and thoughtlessness throughout the entire show. I'm generally disappointed with how her character was fleshed out. Also: her love interest with Jackson never convinced me and seemed to form out of an afterthought. It would have been nice to see her struggle with being single for a while in season one instead of immediately finding love with the most convenient guy.

-- Luke pushing Lorelai away in season six. It just seemed so out of character for him. ""A Vineyard Valentine"" (ep. 15, season 6) was the worst episode for his character, I think. Throughout the entire duration of the episode, he acted selfishly, thoughtlessly, and without regard for Lorelai's feelings.

Since the beginning of the ballet show, the ballerina's weight is the joke that woukdn't end.  What little we hear about Rory's review is really vicious.  I won't atribute this to fat shaming because talking about a ballerina's size, weight, and difficulty performing lifts is a legitimate observation.   If the ballerina stumbles and her partner struggles to lift her within five minutes of the performance, is it safe to assume that her instructors, and the director would have replaced her long ago?   It's strange that she hasn't been told before she doesn't have the grace nor build for her craft.

It's even more sad when she talks about training for fourteen years.  That's a long time to work towards a dream,  very much like a certain Harvard-bound toddler.   

The whole thing was just an episode long joke by two women with perfect bodies despite an aversion to exercise and a love of junk food and take-out.      

I was happy when Mitchum ""crushed"" Rory.     I just felt so sorry for  the ballerina having her dream killed in a such a vicious way; Mithum's review felt like sweet payback.   Maybe she is better at current affairs and hard news,  but that is never shown.

I have Ideas about how I wish they'd done it.

Rory gets her bad review, flips out, steals the boat, has her estrangement from Lorelai. Luke supports her through that, they get engaged. Rory comes to her senses, they reconcile, Lorelai and Luke get married (maybe that's the season 6 finale?). 

Season 7, Rory re-evaluates what she wants to do, and maybe throws herself into a new, related major. Various shenanigans happen so it's not a total snooze of a season, maybe Luke and Lorelai argue more about where to live and if/when to have kids. The April storyline never happens. Liz and TJ are never heard from again, except maybe in passing/one episode of hilarity and frustration. Lane doesn't get pregnant, does get married, keeps playing with the band, they get some good gigs around the state, but at the same time her mom maybe gets sick and needs help, so she helps out with the store and realizes she actually knows antiques really well and is good at that. 

At the end of the season, Logan proposes (there are so many freaking L names on this show, I just noticed), Rory says no, because she doesn't want to move to California, she has [some great opportunity in whatever she's doing]. She also is maybe tired of his immaturity and the LDB (I just watched the episode where they go to dinner and he steals the antique sewing box, so I'm a little annoyed at him). Very last episode, finds out she's pregnant, we get the silly final four words. The series ends. 

But wait, the fans clamor for more, the cast loves working together! 10 years later, we get AYITL. Rory is doing whatever. It's a watered down version of what she wanted maybe- or else a crazy high-powered version (alternatively- she's lost, and then gets Headmaster Charleston's offer, thinks about it, and goes back to get her masters, either in education or literature). She has a 9 year old. I don't care about gender, but it would be interesting to see her with a little boy. Or, a girl, but they don't have the super close relationship, their's is a more normal parent-child. She is conflicted about this. She and Logan aren't together, but he has not at all been the absent father that Christopher was- he's around a lot. He travels a lot, but they co-parent well. She's been dating Paul (who is a really good guy that she actually remembers), but it falls apart (Ooh! Maybe they were married, and the season opens with finalizing the divorce, and maybe Logan decides to try to get her back). Now that I'm thinking as I'm writing- the year opens with her finalizing her divorce, and stuck at a job that sounds great and should be her ideal, but is actually soul-sucking and she hates it. She spends some time lost, then gets the offer to teach. 

Lane has 4 year old twins. She runs the antique shop, and Hep Alien just released their first record (small local label) and she's really torn because it's an opportunity to go on tour, but she doesn't want to raise her kids on the road. Jess moves to Rhode Island, then reconnects with Rory. Series end with them getting together (I hate hate hate young Jess, but older Jess has his shit together, and I think he'd be a great partner). Logan is mildly heartbroken, but hides it. Luke and Lorelai... I'm not sure. Maybe they have a kid? And maybe it's 1-2 years younger than Rory's kid? Or maybe they're just over-involved grandparents? Emily's story stays the same, except they cast someone other than Gypsy, and get rid of the stupid language joke. Dean's cameo is the same. Taylor writes a musical, and while it's terrible, it is terrible in a funny way. Paris and Doyle are married, and cheerfully argue. Paris does cancer research.

 She does horrible things.  Presumably, due to being raised as if she were perfect and never quite understanding the value of money or taking responsibility for her decisions because she's never had to.  

Episode 11, Season 2 - when the Lorelais house has termites, Rory goes against her mothers explicit wishes to ask her grandparents for the money.

Rory doesnt understand at all why Lorelai doesnt want to be obligated to anyone, especially her parents, for the money - she just knows that its there for her to grab.

In Episode 3 of Season 3, Rory decides to write her Harvard application essay on Hilary Clinton.  She then shows up, unprepared, to a seminar she has supposedly helped organise, and is shocked to find that writing about Hilary Clinton is unoriginal. 

Also, shes too scared to call a Harvard Alumni just to set up a dinner.

Season 3: Rory is mad that Jess has tried to move on with someone else, after she kissed him but stayed with Dean.  This culminates in They Shoot Gilmores, Dont They?, where it becomes obvious even to Dean that Rory is obsessed with Jess.  She just wants to have her cake and eat it, refusing to give up Dean until she is forced to, and, as we see in later seasons, not even then.

It both mirrors the way Lorelai tells Christopher she always thought of him as her fallback, and the way Rory impregnates herself with no thoughts whatsoever as to the other parents feelings.

(I am very much of the opinion that Rory got pregnant on purpose.  I think its very suspicious that she successfully avoided pregnancy for 14 years and then it magically happened when it was convenient for her.

Edited to add, from my comments below;  Because having a baby can then become the purpose of her life; not finding a job, not trying to make her career work, nothing difficult. Just, exactly what Lorelai did. Her safe option. It's also a way of holding on to Logan, and we know she doesn't let men go.

I didn't say it was the only explanation; I said it was my preferred theory. Obviously, contraception has a fail rate, though for perfect use, it's typically extremely low.).

In episode 14, at dinner with her grandmother she demands that they talk there and then about Jess black eye, making both Jess and her grandmother uncomfortable, and forcing him to leave.  She refuses to give him the benefit of the doubt or to listen to a word he says.  Again, mirrored in the way she repeatedly ignored Deans requests that she stop talking about Jess.

In this season, we also see the young Lorelai - key moments from her pregnancy and Rorys birth - contrasted with Sheri, Christophers new baby mama.  Lorelai is mad because Sheri is totally accepting of the fact that Lorelai and Christopher are friends, with no jealousy whatsoever, even trying to bond with both of them.  Lorelai is mad becausewhat?  Because of course Sheri should know that Christopher is really Lorelais and that Lorelai will be feeling raw about it?  How would Sheri know that?

Anyway, young Lorelai shows a drive that we never, ever see from Rory, presumably because shes spent her whole life fighting.

Rory also shows that she makes a great admin assistant and struggles to stand up for herself when Sheri goes into labour, though she does get a pass on the latter for being sixteen.

Season 3, episode 18 - Rory is genuinely confused and belligerent about the idea that a loan needs to be paid back.

Series 3; Rory cant survive her first night at Yale without her mother, and her grandmother decks out her dorm room with furniture way too nice for a student.  Lorelai doesnt help; the only difference between the rug and the entertainment centre is that Rory was there when she delivered it.  And that its in Rorys room, not a common room.

On the other hand, at least one guy has no interest in dating Rory, Lorelei fills her room with quiche, and another guy doesnt feel the need to give up the place hes sitting because shes designated it her study tree.  Its a shame she doesnt take advantage of these life lessons and goes with the first paragraph instead.

S04E08 - Rory is genuinely shocked at the fact that her writing isnt instantly good enough to be in the Yale Daily News.  She accuses Doyle of hazing her and of having a vendetta.

When she writes a really mean review, she thinks shes being cute by claiming its only an assignment from her editor and nothing personal.  Absolutely no sense of personal responsibility.

Season 4; Rory doesnt write articles until shes told to.

She could have been writing loads about her trip to Europe for instance, but didnt bother until she was back in a formal setting, with an editor telling her to do it.

When she does have someone telling her what she needs to do, she has very few original ideas.  Writing about Hilary Clinton for her Harvard essay, wanting to write about illegal downloading for the Yale Daily Newsher review, the mean one about the ballerina, quoted some of the most praised lines from Lorelai, not from Rory (paving the way for a year in the life).

The Life and Death Brigade article falls into her lap.  Shes lucky to see the girl in the gorilla mask, and shes lucky that Logan already had a thing for her and gives her a big break.

Rory is not cut out to be an investigative journalist.

Season 4, Episode 21.  One of my favourite episodes; Mrs Kim visits Lane in her new place with the band and slowly starts to accept Lanes life.  Liz marries TJ, who is now arguably the healthiest and sanest person in that entire family, and Jess and Luke bond a little over insulting him.  Lorelai insults Jess for reading a self-help book - can the kid do nothing right? He gets a job, its not good enough, he tries to help himself do better in relationships, not good enough - not realising that its actually Lukes, and that Luke is trying to have a better relationship because hes just got divorced.  Rory steals from a random person with absolutely no sign of guilt; her grandmother introduces her to the grandson of a friend, they go out with his friends, dont hit it off, and she adds what she eats with Dean to their tab with absolutely no sign of guilt or second thought.  She has no idea whose card that is, apart from not-hers, but apparently the world owes her a free lunch, with someone elses husband.  Before then, she was going to have him buy her dinner - no protest whatsoever, or suggestion of at least going somewhere cheaper, or heading back to the dorm to get money, and why the hell is she out with no money anyway?  Did she go out expecting other people to pick up the tab?  Apparently so - with no thought about the fact that he and his wife are having money troubles and hes working every hour god sends, which is why he dropped out of college in the first place.

Season 5.  Lets not even dwell on the whole Marty thing (promised him an evening together after neglecting him for months, ditched it to hang out with Logan.  Ill give her a pass on the paying thing though, Logan offered, which is fair as he invited them both, and its only Martys pride and feeling of competition for Rory which stopped him accepting it, which isnt her fault, as she had no reasonable way of knowing he felt that way) and look at episode 16.  Rory comes home to do laundry and her mother has found her a job (Rory rejects the first two choices).  Perhaps this sort of thing is why she didnt bother to prepare for her interview in Year in the Life.

S5E12 - Rory uses Christopher as a proxy to predict Logans reaction.  She also explicitly uses the exact method Lorelai used to get together with Christopher in the first place, and agrees to have a casual, non-girlfriend relationship with Logan, the first time she resists the commitment-mould shes always been in before.

I dont think Rory has ever actually known what she wants.  She didnt decide she wanted to go to Harvard when she was two - Lorelai did.  She resisted that, but only to the point of going to Yale instead.  Did she decide she wanted to be a journalist?  Did she decide she wanted to be a good, committed girl?  Rory seems to spend a lot of time in a pre-existing mould rather than striking her own path, which is what makes her weak as a journalist, as well as causing other problems.

Putting Rory in that mould is one of the many, many ways in which Lorelai resembles Emily.  Rory resists less, so its not quite as obvious.

S5E19 - Rory objects to Logans family rejecting her because shes a Gilmore!.  She went to Chilton, and to Yale, dont you know.  It would have been totally understandable if theyre rejected Josh instead.

General: Rory asked Jess to go faster, and they ended up getting into an accident.  Rory asked Logan to steal a yacht with her.  Rory is not a good girl, but people in-universe keep insisting she is.

She *does*, at least, take responsibility both times, and tells Lorelai the truth - that it was her idea.  Lorelai - and Luke - absolutely refuse to understand this.  Im not sure anyone else does either.  Which explains a lot about Rory.

If I recall correctly, next season, her grandparents lawyer insists that hell get her off.  He doesnt because the judge is sick of seeing kids like Rory get away with stuff like that, which everyone thinks is really unfair, because its Rory!

Also, Mitchum is absolutely right.  We see that in Year of the Life, and, right now, when she accepts what he says and is grateful for it rather than going fuck you, I can prove you wrong, or turning it into an article.

Lorelai interrupts her friends childrens baptism to row with Rory.  Sookie can hardly be surprised after she and Lorelai pestered the casket bearers at Frans funeral to try to buy her inn though.

S6E2

Richard:  We know you need money and would rather earn it than be given it, so wed like to help you find a job.

(Lololololol)

Rory: Oh, but the job thing was before the community service thing [she was given 300 hours for stealing that yacht] so

so what Rory?  You actually wanted a job just to fill in your days and didnt really think or care about how you were going to fund your lifestyle?  She does exactly the same thing in Year In the Life; does a bit of volunteer work to keep herself busy and doesnt actually connect money with paying bills.  Of course, shes never had to.  Especially over the later seasons we see a lot of Lorelai hiding things from Rory, protecting her, like when she pretending to be over Luke much earlier than she was, when she panicked to Sookie but was calm to Rory, and when she repeatedly insisted that she was the one who would deal with problems.

Its admirable, in many ways, but it has resulted in Rory being totally removed from reality.  Shes known, in theory, that theyre poor, but shes never actually seen the struggle.  At the point where she should be learning how to be independent and manage things herself, both Emily and Lorelai swoop in and buy her furniture.  Shes constantly given free lodging, throughout her entire life, right up to the ripe old age of 32.  Rory has never, ever, had to take responsibility for finding money for food or bills.  She can do those things if she wants to, but her experience, for her entire life, is that if shes too busy, or she just cant be bothered, she can go and ask her grandparents, or her mother will sort it out.

S6E3 - Rory has suddenly gone from fighting with another girl at community service to magically being loved and leading the group.

One thing this does show is that her skillset is very similar to Lorelais.  Shes good at anticipating needs, figuring out how people work together, and getting stuff done, as long as someone tells her what needs to be done (Lorelai is better about that last thing - she runs her own business).  Rory only does things when shes told its what she needs to be doing.  She consistently fails to self-start, or come up with original ideas when left to herself.  She is not a journalist, but shes not without skills.  

S6E5 - Lorelai comes across a large pair of underpants and quips that theyre probably hiding from their owner because Id hate to be around the woman who fits those.

She then answers a call from her friend Sookie, played by Melissa McCarthy.

I wonder if Sookie knows that her friend is disgusted by the idea of bodies like hers?

Lorelai also uses the word spazzy in this episode, which I gather is more acceptable in the US, but is horrendously offensive in the UK.

In S6E9, Rory crashes with Lane.  This is the first time shes ever lived with someone who isnt able and willing to support her indefinitely.  She makes no offer to pay rent, even though shes been working at the DAR, and only tells Zach that its just for a few days.  At least shes looking for a job.

Oh, and Lorelai tries to coax Luke into fighting during dinner instead of waiting until their guests leave.  These Gilmore Girls are incredibly inconsiderate to the comfort of others.

S6E12 - Logan is the boyfriend Lorelai most approves of while knowing the worst there is to know about him.  She thinks she likes Dean, but neither she nor Rory know about how creepy and menacing Dean is to both Jess and Luke at different times.  Lorelai doesnt approve of Jess at all, and that seems to be based purely on prejudice rather that knowledge.  She takes against him immediately, and very little of it is based on anything he actually does.

I also noticed that Luke and Lorelai have the exact same reaction to Jess and then Rory dropping out of education.  Namely you cant live here *boot*.

Lorelais jealousy over April and Anna is very similar to Lukes reaction to Christopher calling.  I think most of their problems come from the areas in which they are similar.

One last bit of foreshadowing for Year in the Life here; Rory says that Lorelais letter should be anthologised.

S6E13 is one of my favourite episodes.  Its the one where we see how absolutely terrible Paris is at managing people, and how good Rory is at it.  Its one of the very, very few times we actually see Rory do something really well, as opposed to being told shes good at it.  Its something weve seen Lorelai do quite a lot as well, so we know where Rory learned it.

My absolute favourite is probably the one where Mrs Kim decides that, while she doesnt approve of what Lane is doing, shell be damned if Lane is going to fail at it.

S7E7.  Lorelai and Christopher are in Paris, reminiscing over how they planned to come here as teenagers.  Prior to this, Lorelai was being overly controlling and buttinski about Gigi and Sherry.  Even earlier, Lorelai claimed Sherry was copying her by naming Gigi Gigi (short for Georgia) as its too similar to Rory (short for Lorelai).

In short, I think Lorelai is playing that she and Christopher stayed together when Rory was a baby, with Gigi as a surrogate Rory.  She knows, deep down, that it wont work, but shes given up on Luke, and as she told Christopher a few seasons ago, hes always been her back up.

Christopher, for his part, stayed with Sherry because he didnt want to walk out on another child.  Maybe its the same for him.  Hes playing that he didnt.

(Although, by other accounts, he didnt; Lorelai pushed him away and refused to let him be a part of their lives, as Rory will later do to the father of her child (obviously, the Wookie)).

In one of Nick Hornbys books, a character states that a relationship shouldnt end until its completely rotting and stinking.  Otherwise, youll always be tempted to go back.

Lorelai and Christophers relationship never reached that stage.  It ended first because of Rory and then because of Gigi.  It never ended because they simply got to the point where they couldnt stand one another any more.  You can see why they were tempted to try again; maybe they did have a chance, if no surprise pregnancies or other bad luck came along.

S7E10 - Rory, who has had Logan paying her rent for the entire year, and has wealthy grandparents and a generous mother, plans to steal food from Yale.  Like she stole from that guy who left his card behind the bar back when she first started.  Rory really does not grasp the concept of funding her own lifestyle.

S7E19 - Rory genuinely doesnt get why Paris wants support opening her post-grad applications, despite having witnessed what happened when she didnt get into Harvard.

Winter: Lorelai mocks the concept of trigger-warnings.  Okay, nothing traumatic has ever happened to you (to the extent of developing post-traumatic stress), do you need to mock the people it has happened to?

Spring:  Lorelais rant about actors names.  Apparently they should all have Caucasian names because theyre better.

Summer - Rory throws a tantrum when her mother refuses to hand over her entire life.

She also scoffs at the jobs shes been offered - like teaching at Chilton - and does a poor job of running the paper by assuming she knows best and not bothering to listen to feedback.

I haven't commented on Rory's relationships in Year in the Life, because I don't see any evidence that she isn't having an open relationship with Paul and that Logan doesn't have the same arrangement with his fiance.  Rory's relationships have usually been her form of rebellion from the mould her mother and grandparents try to put her in, so it makes sense to me that she'd go for an open relationship and keep it a secret.",79,2,False,spoiler,,,,,

 His Mom had died when he was young (maybe before he was 10) and Christopher was pretty much non existent as a father to Rory so they had really no support from him in the eyes of Luke.

&gt; LORELAI: Hey, are you good at dating?

&gt; ... (Luke says no)

&gt; LORELAI: I don't have it down either. I've never been very good at it really. I've never even really liked it. Too much 'what if'. I like things I can count on. I mean, uh, actually, with Max, it was the first time I was finally like 'Hey, here it is, that one person who will always be there for me.' And then, I turned around, and it's suddenly 'Oops, wrong, keep moving.'

&gt; LUKE: Why are you telling me this?

&gt; LORELAI: I don't have very many people in my life who are in my life permanently forever. They will always be there for me. I will always be there for them, you know? There's Rory, and Sookie, and this town and ... you. I mean, at least I think I've got...

&gt; LUKE: You do.

&gt; LORELAI: Good. Just checking 

As a reminder, it comes after Lorelai is told very plainly:

&gt; SOOKIE: Don't you understand that Luke is so into you?

&gt; LORELAI: Okay, stop.

&gt; SOOKIE: He has had to watch you go from one guy to another, and then the engagement, and then the engagement was off, and patiently he's waited. And now in walks this kid and he says, 'My God, will she date anyone else in the world before she'll date me?'

&gt; LORELAI: Sookie, that

&gt; SOOKIE: Hey, maybe it's crazy, maybe it's irrational, but it's there. Just look the guy in the eye, it's right there. 

With that in mind, I think it's an important scene for understanding Lorelai's attitude towards Luke at that point....but, as always in the first four seasons, it's a bit tough to decipher. So what do you think Lorelai was trying to say? 

It's possible that she continues refusing to believe Sookie, and simply wants to make Luke feel better by showing that he's important to her. That would makes sense based on how she continues to act in later episodes. But maybe she finally took it to heart, in which case there are two possible meanings IMO...

* 'I love you as a friend, but only as a friend.' I read a comment on another forum that cited this scene as proof that she isn't interested in Luke romantically at that point, and it's her way of gently letting him down. 

* 'I know we could be a couple, but you're too important to me and I don't want to risk ruining it and losing you.' Is she cryptically admitting that she *wants* to be with Luke but is too afraid? It would make sense based on the comments about ruining past relationships.

Advice for graduates and reflections on staying true to yourself from the beloved Gilmore Girls actress and New York Times bestselling author of the memoir Talking as Fast as I Can and the novel Someday, Someday, Maybe.

If youre not where you want to be on this day  dont worry about it. Because the spotlight aspect of life? Thats not the satisfying part.

In this expansion of her 2017 commencement speech at her hometown Langley High, Lauren Graham reflects in her hilarious, relatable voice, on growing up, pursuing your dreams, and living in the here-and-now. Whatever path you choose, whatever career you decide to go after, the important thing, she writes, is that you keep finding joy in what youre doing, especially when the joy isnt finding you. She reminds us to be curious and compassionate, no matter where life takes you. Whether you hope to be an actor or a politician or a mathematician, Ive learned that empathy and kindness are your most valuable tools. Grounded and inspiring, this is Grahams roadmap to a happy life: Be a fan, not a theater critic.",10,25,False,self,,,,,

As soon as Rory leaves that sheltered world and starts living in the real word, she seems to have problems adjusting to life outside.

So, my question is: if Rory and Lorelai had lived in - lets say New York City - do you think she would have been just as well behaved? Or would she have met people that could have gotten her ""in trouble""? ",8,11,False,self,,,,,
