Whereas with Chris, they have chemistry too, but are so obviously are compatible based on interests, jokes and banter, Rory, background, etc. Plus with them, they often showed verbally and physically that they loved each other, which we rarely saw with Luke.

Rules:

* You may only have one prediction post here at a time.

* If you want to change your guess, delete the first comment and add a new one (don't edit!!)

* Only guesses made a week before the official date announcement count.

* Post in this format: MM/DD (sorry for anyone used to the opposite format but we need to pick something for the sake of consistency, and the show is filmed in the US so I thought this was the most fair)

* If no one guesses the right day, the person whose guess is closest wins. 

* In the event of a tie (same day guessed or same difference between guess and actual date) the person who posted first wins. 

* If you want to add a comment, I suggest making a second post just for the comment so it's easy to see all the predictions!

* rate each episode from 1-10 (where 5 is OK, so not everything should get 7+)
* see average ratings per episode and per season
* rank the seasons and see consensus season rankings 
* search transcripts by keyword, exact phrase, and character
* mark lines from scripts as favorites, and see which lines have the most favorites
* add notes to script lines (useful for annotating references)
* and for fun, the characters page shows # of speaking lines per character

He's a timid man who doesn't say much and tries to stay out of the house so he doesn't have to deal with mama Kim.

Yet somehow, I can't stop watching. I still carry torches for Tristen and Maaaax Medina, but I'm sure they're gone for good. I looked up the cast once and it showed how many episodes each character was in...speaking of that - when I realized the grandparents were in every damn episode, my heart sank. I think it's mostly due to the grandmother's voice. I think she means well, but it would be nice if she appeared/spoke less. 

As for Maaaaax Medina - I thought he was a cutie pie! I feel like his character got screwed over when he and Lorelai got back together...they just made him super clingy and propose in the most lackluster way possible. 

I thought Tristen and Rory would have been cute since they initially bickered for so long. 

Another thing that irritates me is when Lorelai and Rory go to Luke's and he has to run to the store to get more groceries. Why don't they offer to run to the store for him since he's working and they'd just sit there longer waiting for him to come back? It's not like he did random maintenance on her house or anything. 

Next up, we have Dean. Let me tell you, I was *so* excited when they broke up the second time. I thought to myself, ""Finally! I no longer have to stare at Dean and his two emotions [bewildered or angry]!"" I was stoked. How nave of me. Now he's convinced Rory to be ""friends."" Because they were in each other's lives for two years and bla bla bla. Couldn't he have gone away for one episode? Did the writers want this or did they have to fulfill some type of contract? What did Rory see in him, besides the height? Were they really together for two years? Wouldn't the honeymoon phase wear off by then so she could realize he was dumber than a box of rocks? Not to mention a poster child of red flags...first, there was the whole ordeal with the homecooked meal, then the inappropriately premature car gift, ""oh but nevermind, you won't say I love you back, so we're over."" Then in late S2/early S3 was him getting pissed off all the time. The house-building project, the lunch basket, her having to study instead of watching him go play softball or whatever, the bracelet, the car accident, etc. His angry face looks even dumber than his bewildered face. I can't do it. Make it stop. Please?

On a more positive note, I really like Paris. Paris is my favorite. ",10,6,False,self,,,,,

If it were cheating, they'd have been together while he slept around.  If they were together in any meaningful sense of the word:

1) Rory's insistence on cutting off contact him wouldn't have made *any sense*

2) He wouldn't have to get her *back*.  She'd already have been there.

3) There would be *some* symptom of these two being a couple, but I honestly can't think of one other than Rory's insistence that she has a claim on his behavior, who he can be with, and what he can do during this time.  That being the only sign of a relationship doesn't make a couple-relationship--it makes an entitled, unfair, controlling, mutually degrading relationship.  How many of you feel you can choose with whom your exes spend their time?  I don't, because if I did, I'd be a huge jackass.  Rory's been finding all kinds of ways to piss me off lately.

I especially see this with Jess/Logan fans. I just typed this in another thread, because I think the most pervasive thing I see is that each team wants to say their choice grew and the other did not and it's absolutely PAINFUL to read. 

""Ok, sorry, I'm a not a team Jess person (or team anyone, as I don't have myself invested in who Rory ends up with), but I HATE when people say that people are saying Jess grew because he wrote a book. Are you kidding me? It has nothing to do with him writing a book. Sure, it's good to see that he found a passion and obviously worked hard enough to make something happen, but I think we see the real growth of Jess in his relationship with Luke. You can tell that he is getting over being all ""the world is out to get me"" and becoming more vulnerable and willing to show his emotional side, which I think is where we see the real growth in Jess as a character.

In addition, Whoever it was that said Logan didn't grow is also being short-sighted. Logan had a lot of growth, both away from the LDB kind of crap and then striking out on his own, learning to settle down, etc. We also see him as, honestly, the most sweet and thoughtful of Rory's boyfriend's near the end. I realize a majority of this growth is in season 7, so if you are someone who hasn't seen season 7 you may not be as convinced.""",35,11,False,self,,,,,
