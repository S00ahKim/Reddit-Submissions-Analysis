There's more than one way, but Lorelai talking about getting married ""this month"" and how that seemed odd because the date of the wedding was November 5th seems to be an easy go-to example. It's easy enough to ""let go"" of this detail, but it got me thinking.

We also have heard that the date of the wedding was modified in post-production. In my mind, that's due to them initially not taking into account the timeline of the election and then later deciding to want the series to end pre-election to avoid us wondering why the election was never mentioned. 

What if the original wedding date was supposed to be November 25th? Editing the 25th down to the 5th seems like an easier post-production graphics change than any other switch. Granted, I know that it would be totally possible to change it to anything they wanted - I'm just going with the thought that they were low on budget and would opt for the quickest/cheapest option.

The 25th was the release date of the series and it would have been a cool meta-acknowledgment to have us up binge-watching late at night and then see the middle-of-the-night-wedding and the final four words in ""real time"".

First post here. I read the rules, but if I'm out of line somehow, feel free to let me know and I'll correct as needed.

I know that this has all been discussed to death, but that's fandom for you. It's what we do. 

I am BEYOND irritated with what ASP did with Rory in AYITL. Yes, I understand that she made stupid choices and exhibited entitlement and possibly narcissism in the OS. I didn't notice it much as a teenager, but can see it clearly as an adult. Some of that, maybe even a lot of that, can be chalked up to being immature. We've all been idiots at one time or another.

But ugh. Rory in the revival. So bad.

I related with Rory so much during the OS run. If she were a real person, we'd be 2 months apart. My mom got pregnant with me when she was 18 and she has a difficult relationship with her mother. I was reserved and sarcastic and awkward (pretty much still am). Loved books. Went to a private school (not because I'm a genius but because the public school sucked). I dated a Dean-type, a Jess-type, a Logan-type. She wanted to be a journalist, I wanted to be a journalist. It was all very much #rorygilmoreismyspiritanimal.

I was so eager for AYITL. Didn't really have expectations in terms of the story (beyond the fact that Luke and Lorelai should have already been married, maybe with a kid). I just wanted to enjoy this world, these characters, again. What a letdown. 

I've got friends of all sorts of backgrounds, beliefs, orientations and the like - not one of them is sleeping with or would sleep with the person they rejected a decade earlier. Not one of them who was rejected by someone they loved and had moved on to another relationship would start seeing the person who rejected them a decade later. And while I know my fair share of entitled folks who won't hold a job, most in my circle (mid-20s to late-30s) understand that the bills gotta get paid. Maybe it's not the dream or ideal job, but you do it because you're a responsible human being. If you don't, there are nasty consequences - none of which Rory experiences.

In my eyes, AYITL was basically ASP flipping off all GG fans. She didn't care what would have made sense. She seems to loathe we millennials especially, which is odd since that seems to be the target demographic for both the OS and the revival. (Not saying that older or younger people can't enjoy). 

TL;DR - ASP sucks.

Edit to add: Logan isn't Rory's Christopher. Rory herself IS Christopher.",6,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

But I do love this show, and it has been a great help to me over the years. I have (hopefully) learned a lot from it, and it continues to motivate me to be someone better than who I am today.

But I do wonder sometimes if the deep connection I feel for these characters and stories has contributed to a deep loneliness that I can't seem to shake. I am very lucky in that I am with someone I love, who loves me back. And I do love her, and I want us to stay together. But we have our problems, and sometimes I feel very much alone. Even when I am feeling happy, which luckily happens pretty often, I still wonder - are we soul mates? Or even a worse feeling - Is she somewhere out there? I know Lorelai is just a character, but what if my Lorelai is out there? 

But maybe not everyone gets to be a Luke and Lorelai, sadly. I guess that could be true. Maybe I am Max. Or Rory - someone who tries but it's not in the cards. I hope I can at least live as courageously as Rory. 

Anyway, I will spare you from further crazy ranting. I just wondered if any of you feel something similar. I hope you are all having a nice weekend.

--(Spoilers for The Subterraneans)--

The Subterraneans is a love story, but not the kind with a romantic ending. It describes Leo Percepied's self-destructive choices that eventually lead to the ruin of his relationship with a woman he's very much in love with, Mardou Fox. Borrowing from Dostoevsky, Kerouac blurs the line between dream and reality when Leo dreams Mardou cheats on him with another man. His obsession with this dream, like Oedipus, brings it to reality. Ultimately, Leo ends up losing Mardou after a night of jealous fights as she runs to the other man for peace from Leo's outbursts.

While I understand her frustrations with Luke, what with him postponing their wedding and solely focusing on April and keeping Lorelai away from getting to know her, I feel her response of going to the diner and making a spectacle of herself ridiculous at best. The irony of all of this is when she discusses the fact that she feels her parents (Richard and Emily) have the worst communication skills while she is talking to the therapist, she and Luke pretty much have the same issue. Which to me, makes absolutely no sense since this woman is constantly talking. She should have spoken to him about her feelings starting with being honest about the fact that she was not ok with postponing the wedding in the first place.

UGH and let me not get started on Christopher. I understand he was allegedly so in love with her and perhaps he saw a window and took it, but it was so not the time for that. I feel he took advantage of the situation entirely and it honestly made him look like a total scumbag to me.

For someone who claimed to love someone so much and wanted to marry them so badly, her jumping right into bed with her ex after an argument with her fiance says otherwise. I don't see how an argument is a breakup. Which reminds me of the Logan/Rory situation re the bridesmaids.... but I digress..

I cant really form an opinion so I would like to hear your takes on it. I do have some conflicting feelings though:

- it is super cute of her

- also she never acts as if her going to college = being smarter or anything. she is just like, you can totally do it and I hope you know it

- on the other hand, how infuriating is hearing that from a girl who can afford to go to a fancypants private school and focus all of her energy into the single goal of college. and who is set to have a debt-free Ivy League education. I mean come on, it borders on insulting

- also it feels like she is forcing her values on both boys. from what we see Dean and Jess value other things - mainly providing for yourself. in Dean's case that also means providing for his family. in Jess' case that also means following his passion and not following the traditional middle-class path. both of them seem to succeed in those life goals despite not giving much value to formal education (we dont really know what Dean ended up doing tho so there's that)

- then again it seems all she means is, you dont have to settle, you can reach for more. it is just that she is blinded by her privilege. but she means super well.

also, does she ever do something similar with Logan?? I guess she does push him into wanting more but the money dynamics make the situation completely different???

so, endearing or condescending as fuck? do you guys have a sentence? or I am the only one who even thinks this detail is any interesting?",69,44,False,self,,,,,

Rory may have gotten in on her own merit, but it was only because of Richard and Emily's money she was able to attend. It brings up the question: would Rory have been able to achieve any of the things she did without her Gilmore connections? Because IMO Rory couldn't have been the only smart kid at Stars Hollow High but she may have been the only one with rich grandparents willing to fund her education. 

The mere fact that she HAS rich grandparents, whether or not she takes advantage of their wealth makes her far more privileged than characters such as Lane or Jess. 

Again, with college, Yale was her safety school because Richard was friends with the dean of admissions. Yale was her SAFETY SCHOOL! That is absurd!!! 

Lorelai is a more skewed example because she really did work for everything she had, but again, the fact she had rich relatives to fall back on if she really, really needed it makes her luckier than most, even if she was very stubborn and pigheaded about NOT taking their money, which sometimes was taken to ridiculous levels (the termite episode, for instance ) and the fact that she's in line to inherit everything once Emily dies. 

Logan, obviously, is the embodiment of wealth and white privilege, which usually I can appreciate (I really love Gossip Girl which is basically Wealth and Privilege: The Show) but in contrast to Jess who gets kicked out of high school for missing a bunch of days when he was working at Wal-Mart, Logan gets expelled from like five or six boarding schools, sinks a yacht, steals another yacht, and basically parties his way through an Ivy League education (which I totally get why he does) and still gets a future and a company basically handed to him on a silver platter because of his money and his last name, seems super unfair. 

But Rory to me is the most egregious, especially since she is adamant that she is NOT apart of the Hartford elite despite the fact that she actually enjoys a lot of that kind of life and despite the fact that pretty much everything she has is because of Richard and Emily's money. AYITL is even worse, when you think of the fact that she's presumably living off a trust fund and simultaneously saying she's broke. Rich White Women: the life.",84,119,False,self,,,,,

It would have fit their image very well.

Also, I wonder that if she was 'horse-mad' would she have been 'boy-mad' - horses may have provided her with a more subtle escape from E&amp;R's house.

Would Rory still have been born?

Or were her life choices always about rebelling about E&amp;R's/High society control and expectations?

They have been a source of inspiration and comfort for me for many years now. Like lots of people, it's more than a tv show for me. One thing it has left with me is a feeling of wanting to be a better person. I know this sounds a bit crazy, but I want to be someone my favorite characters would have been proud of. Especially Lorelai. I want to be someone who might have fit in, in Stars Hollow, and who would have been a good citizen.

As much as I love this show and the revival, sadly it might be time for me to let it go. This may be partly related to some emotional problems I likely have, but I think on some subconscious level I feel as though these characters are an extension of my family. I do love them - truly. Which perhaps is not healthy.

Maybe I am holding onto this show in part because it reminds me of happier times, when I was younger and I had so much more ahead of me. An expansive future full of possibilities. 

Anyway, I am not sure what my point is to be honest. Maybe it is just to say goodbye. A little piece of my heart will always be in Stars Hollow. ",21,27,False,self,,,,,
