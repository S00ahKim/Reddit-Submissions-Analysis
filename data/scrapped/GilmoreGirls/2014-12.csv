Sometimes she take more than 30 minutes to choose what to watch just because she can't decide the episode.

So to help her to go quick I made a simple tool to randomize a episode in the entire serie.

Instructions:

All the seasons are included in the default random, if you want remove some, just click on it.

Then click the Yellow Button: ""Randomizar Episdio.

The witty fast talking is adorable and cheesy and fantastic. I am currently starting up season 2, just finished episode two. Half the fun of this show is following the heavy hints to predict the future of the characters. I've done pretty well so far, but there are so many plot points to come. If any of my predictions are right don't confirm them or deny them

Yes, I know the series is over. With enough people rewatching it or watching it for the first time, maybe we can share our predictions!

Season 1-early2 spoilers here.

Short term series predictions. Luke and Lorelai are going to totally hook up and ruin the planned wedding. I bet it is going to happen in a single passionate kiss. And then Lorelai is going to be all OH MY GOD and probably tell no one why she is cancelling. A whole episode dedicated to this deception.

I also feel like Luke is going to leave town at some point. He has such a connection to the town that I feel like it is too easy a plot point to miss.

Rory has to break up with boyfriend. He is so boring and I don't think I can handle him for a hundred more hours of episodes. She will also need to get on the pill. I bet we have quite a few bad boy decisions in the coming season.

Lane is going to come back and meet her korean romeo and be destined to wed by season 4. 

Michel is a badass and we will probably meet some of his family at some point. He probably hates them. 

Christopher is going to stick around and complicate things for seasons to come. I dislike him. He is smarmy and tacky. I wanted him to get hit by a bus when he was ruining everything at the end of season one. I would still be okay if he got hit by a bus.

The parents are going to become more likable so that we can move away from them being significant antagonists.

WTF happened? It's like the show became an unbearable soap opera out of nowhere.

I feel like the show was great up until Rory and Lorelai stopped talking. A big part of what made the show great in the earlier seasons was the banter between Rory and Lorelai. Not having this was sorely missed.

And then randomly, Luke has a daughter he's never heard about? Talk about artificial plot inflation. Can't we stick to the numerous plotlines we've already developed and tie _those_ up, first?

Especially in Season 7, it's like everyone went out of character and became weird versions of themselves. 

Lorelai wasn't as witty. The France subplot was cliche and unnecessary. Christopher became _super whiny_ and insecure. Getting that upset over a _character reference_ for a legitimate purpose just... agghhhh. I didn't like Lorelai and Chris together anyway. To me, a big part of their relationship was the notion that the _timing was never right_, and this was pretty much ignored in the final season.

Also, I didn't like that Chris became super-loaded, either, as this felt like a deus ex machina. We already had the Gilmore parents for this. Whenever some big monetary obstacle came up, boom, the parents would just take of it (with strings attached), and this would help drive this-and-that development, whatever. But now it's like everyone's magically a gajillionaire and so I just stopped caring. This problem started even earlier though, in Season 5, when suddenly _Kirk_ was secretly loaded, too. 

And Christiane Amanpour showing up at the hotel, of all hotels, of all places, and meeting Rory, of all people? 

The cliche ""run into some hot prof in the library"" thing? What was that about? 

The whole Marty thing never made any sense to me, either. Felt very tacked-on and forgettable. 

Kirk's antics escalated to a point where I felt like ""too much of a good thing"" applied. Yeah, he's funny due to his quirky nature and countless jobs, but I felt like this was exploited to the point where it was no longer funny, as a sort of ""oh, it's another installment of Kirk's gimmick-of-the-week."" 

I also started to really dislike Rory. She's established a rather firm pattern for herself as a dishonest cheater who actually cares very little for the guys she's with.

I dunno, the final couple of seasons bothered me immensely. It's like the writers stopped giving a shit towards the end of Season 5.",0,0,False,default,,,,,

(Spoiler Warning),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/2o90io/predictions_part_2_late_season_2_spoiler_warning/,viciouscorndog,1417689943,"Alright. I made a little bit of progress ([First thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/2o19gk/gilmore_girls_prediction_early_series_spoilers/)) and I just finished Season 2 Episode 16. There's the Rub. 

Summary: Lorelai and Emily went to spa, danced with old man, strengthened relationship by crime. Rory has secret dinner with Paris and Jess. Gets caught. 

Predictions Thread Time
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Rory is going to break up with Dean fairly soon. It will be vaguely about Jess but more about control issues and really they are just not that compatible. 

Before they break up Jess and Paris are going to start dating. This will hurt Rory and Paris's relationship. Jess will be a smooth cat and be passive aggressive to Rory about her dislike for their relationship.

Rory will ultimately get between them. Though only briefly because he will eventually go back to where he came from. It will be a very sad la la la moment. We will meet Luke's sister and she will turn out to be an okay person. We will learn more about Luke's Dad and why she couldn't handle staying in the town where her family once thrived. She will leave with Jess.

I have a feeling that Tristan is going to re-enroll at Chilten and make Mary a Magdalene. He will be less awful this time.

Lane is back in town but she broke up with korean romeo. That might throw a wrench into things. I think he will be back. She will end up fitting her mother's mold uncomfortably well. Her mother will overreact to some future problem, find out that she over-reacted, and permanently change the way she views her daughter. Lane's mom is too one dimensional and I think the show is going to rectify that. 

Sookie and Jackson are going to get married. Things will go off without a hitch. It will be beautiful. Sookie will freak out over the food. While they walk down the aisle we will hear that La la la la la la song. Because why not? They will be the stable relationship in this show for quite a while. 

This might be a little off the wall and I'm probably reading too much into things, but Emily and Richard are going to have some marriage problems. Those problems will grow and climax around season 5. They will at some point become separated. I think there can be a hilarious few episodes when Emily stays at Lorelai's house. They will ultimately get back together. LOVE CONQUERS ALL.

Except when you are Christopher. His relationship is going to fall apart eventually. His girlfriend is too orderly for him. He likes spontaneity. I hope we see more of his girlfriend though. She was that uncomfortable kind of funny that I like in the show.

Lorelai's future is the most difficult to predict at this point. She just recognized the source of her commitment issues and might be ready to move on. I doubt she will see what is right in front of her face. Luke isn't going to happen for awhile. Jess is going to drive a wedge between them as soon as things start looking good. There are no good predictions for her at this point. That plot just isn't developed yet.

Lorelai will own and operate the inn that she currently runs. The owner will sell it at a reasonable price because she is wonderful. When that inn is successful she will also own the bed and breakfast. Old lady will take a literal long vacation and leave it to her.

Maybe she was exaggerating when she shared the details with Rory, but the way she described her aversion to the sex stuff felt so depressing... But, I thought, those things CAN change, if she and her partner are patient and understanding toward each other.

But oh no, thought the writers, fuck Lane, let's make her pregnant the first time she has sex. With twins, no less. Because, fuck Lane.

Where does that leave Lane at the series' end? As a mother of 2 at the age of 22, with no education, maybe a job at Luke's when the babies are older, a music career that's most likely to be on hold for years  and years (if not forever) and a husband that's going on a 2 month tour pursuing his dream.

Yay?

Maybe I'm reading to much into it, but if *I* was in Lane's shoes, I'd probably feel that my life was pretty much over and look forward to a a bit of depression and resentment in the future.",10,30,False,self,,,,,

Just wanted to post my thoughts on the show so far:

-The Friday dinner commitment seems soo unrealistic -- they're expected to keep this up despite Lorelai working full time, Rory in a competitive private school and being a teenager -- Friday nights are a big thing for teens...and I'd think Lorelai would want to just veg out on Friday nights after working a full week. I hate the dinners. I hope this stops once she goes to college. 

-I don't like scenes with Emily and Richard. I find them to be boring characters and way over the top--especially Emily. Hopefully they become more tolerable as I get further into the series. Also I'm under the impression that prior to giving money for school, Rory and Lorelai had nothing to do with them. Now they're a huge part of their life so fast? Seems weird.

-mrs Kim is way over the top. Holding Lane up in her bedroom, missing school for like a week? REALLY?

-Michel really annoyed me at first but I love him now

-Chris is so slimy. Also I just don't buy it that he all of a sudden got a great job and his life together out of the blue. 

-I love all the Chilton scenes. more Paris!!!! 

-I thought Paris got into the Puffs? 

-not a fan of the town hall scenes. Too over the top

-why is it always fall in Stars Hollow? It seems like on one episode it'll be summer the the next, they're decorating with scarecrows and pumpkins!

-the streets of Stars Hollow are always filled with people, no matter what time or day of the week. Makes me lol....real small towns are never that hoppin'

-it's fun watching the (lack of modern) technology in these early seasons...they're still using pay phones, using VHS tapes (just saw one in season 3!), referencing Palm Pilots and pagers! Love it! But to really makes me feel old.

-Rory's choice in men so far...ugh! Dean is a stage 5 clinger and Jess isn't a good match for her. I am enjoying the dean/Jess/Rory love triangle drama though. I'd chose Jess over Dean, so far...if I had to pick.",24,11,False,self,,,,,

I mean, she's pregnant for half of season 3 and 4, has Davey, finds out she's pregnant again halfway through season 5, has Martha beginning of season 6, and then becomes pregnant again halfway through season 7! 

So thats:
Half season 3, half season 4 = pregnant (Davey)
Half season 5, Half season 6 = pregnant (Martha)
Half season 7 = pregnant (unknown)

I hate to actually say this....but I can't help but feel this has something to do with Melissa's weight in real life. Why is she always pregnant? To make it okay for a fuller figure? I mean, when Lane gets pregnant she gets a ridiculously huge fake belly (yes, I know it's twins, and it's supposed to be a funny thing..) that seemed to develop overnight. Whereas Sookie's baby belly doesn't every really get noticeable until, like, the episode she gives birth. 

TLDR; I guess what I'm asking is, what was the reasoning behind Sookie's pregnancy? Was Melissa pregnant in real life so they had to write it in? Was Melissa's weight an issue? (for the record, I LOVE Sookie. I love how her character is not defined by her weight). Or are her pregnancies representative of a typical growing family?

Then, she remodels the entire poolhouse for her,  and she does nothing but party and screw Logan in it. And she has the audacity to get upset and move out when they move her into the main house.

* Lorelei taught me that there really is a light at the end of the tunnel and to tackle every obstacle full force.
* Kirk taught me that its okay to be myself no matter how quirky I may be.
* Rory showed me that hard work does pay off and to follow my dreams no matter how big or how hard I may fall.
* Luke taught me how to be a good friend.
* Jess taught me that I can find my way no matter how lost I may feel.
* Dean taught me never to rush into anything, especially marriage.
* Emily taught me that no matter how strongly I believe in my judgments I must learn to respect others points of views.
* Richard taught me that connections are extremely important in the real world.
* Paris taught me to speak my mind always.

Considering the amount of free-time I usually have, I pretty much spent all of it watching this show.

I'm not one for generalizations, but after reading some of the posts on this subreddit, I think it's easy for me to assume that most of the demographic here is made up of girls. Well....I'm a guy. A straight guy. So many of my friends have made fun of giRlmore girls, so it's kind of been a guilty pleasure. I started watching the show on Netflix because Lauren Graham is like...really damn hot. Rory became seriously good-looking as the seasons went on.

Anyways, I just thought I'd offer my perspective because this show transformed my view of relationships...and life as I went through the seasons. 

From the first season, the show made it clear that Rory was as close to perfect as a person could be. She was brilliant, beautiful, hilarious and somehow everyone loved her. I'm a dude and I wanted to be her. I think I would've ran home ready to leave Chilton if someone like Paris decided to try to ruin my reputation/life from day one. Not Rory. Rory gave no fucks, so Rory does what she wants. Just kills it at school, and let everything else fall into place. 

Jesus, if I had the mental faculties and the laser-like focus that Rory possesses...well I honestly wouldn't be where I am in life today. Yes, folks, I actually became envious of Rory and even started resenting her at bit. Everything was too perfect. Rich grandparents that would willingly throw away money for her, boys who just fell at her feet as she walked by.

That's another thing. The guys in this show....look, I'm not anti-feminist by any means. I'm certainly not sexist at all. But, the guys in this show got shat on continuously by the women. 

Dean- everything was going fine, but Rory just changed her mind because Jess was something new and exciting. Dean, the guy who was actually obsessed with her, got shat on.

Jess- I'm not sure about whether he really got shat on, but he did get mislead a little by rory randomly showing up in Philadelphia. If I were in his shows, I probably would have done the same thing. Rory was jsut trying to get back at Logan, so she just took advantage of his feelings for her. 

Max- straight up shat on. Yes yes, Lorelai didn't feel that it was *right* for her. Guys, she just left without saying a word, took a road trip and that was it. Max got straight up dumped on.

Luke- good god, this might turn into a luke-esque rant. Honestly, this guy got shat on by 1000 elephants throughout this show. If I were in his shoes, I would just turn into a hermit and live out my diner-owning days. 

At every junction in his love-life, he's gotten destroyed by women. I can't remember the name of the lawyer lady at the moment, but even after she came to HIM and wanted to try to continue the relationship, she CHEATED on him! Wtf, she's the one who wanted to continue the relationship! 

The Nardini lady. Goddamn, he had to fight for custody over his daughter because the Nardini lady couldn't handle another person being in April's life. I mean, the show didn't even allow April to tell her mom how much Luke meant to her. The mom just kind of assumed that Luke was a bad guy, and he deserves no interaction with April. Goddamn, Luke didn't even know he had a daughter until she showed up at his diner. That discovery ruined his relationship with Lorelai.

Finally, Luke and Lorelai. The entire show revolved around the interactions between the two. For continuous seasons, the tension between the two kept growing and growing, and I'm sure when fans of this show finally saw them together, they exploded in a fiery conflagration of satisfaction and YES HE DID IT! in golden letters. But people...Luke was blind. Lorelai repeatedly took advantage of his feelings for her, in my opinion. She denied it, but she knew of his feelings. Luke tolerated her antics, all because he was in love with her. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I could ever do that. Right now, I'm kind of dealing with a girl who's flirting with me mad hard, but isn't really *interested*. Kind of seems like she's just flirting for her ego. I'm not having any of it, though. I like her, but it's not worth it for me. She can be a friend, but I won't let her use me....like Lorelai used Luke! Lorelai CHEATED ON LUKE and he was still in love with her after, they were still friends and everything was fine even after. That doesn't make ANY sense. Just unrealistic.

Despite all of that though, this show is actually fantastic. It's seriously made me contemplate about all of my past relationships and pretty much taught me a lot of different perspectives that I hadn't previously considered. I was cheated on by my ex-gf about a year ago. It was one of the hardest things I've ever gone through, and it doesn't help that the guy she cheated on me with...they're going to get married. Kind of like Luke/Lorelai. Probably why I had such strong opinions. However, this show really dealt with problems in relationships in ways I wish I had dealt with them. It's taught me a lot.

Again, I'm a straight guy, but this show will probably be in my thoughts for the days to come. I think I'm going to try to emulate some aspects of Rory into my life, because man, she had a dream and she GOT somewhere. I hope I find someone that is like Lorelai. Tall, witty, confident. 

tl;dr: Im a guy. I like this show. It had Lauren Graham in it, showed me how people should handle relationships, showed me how to get what I want in life. Not a fan of how the guys in this show got shat on.

I'm so so sorry for the long post. If anyone made it through, awesome! Feel free to give me your thoughts! If you didn't like my thoughts, tell me! I'm down for a discussion. There's so much more to say, but that's what the reddit comment section is for.",21,17,False,self,,,,,

At the behest of my wife (she saw bits of it before), we've been binge watching the show. Just finished s02e04, with the Harvard tour.

1. I'm confused by Lorelei's finances. So she raised Rory as a single mother yet they seem to live in a decent-sized house and eat out all the time? Maybe it's the difference between 2000 and today, but shouldn't she be desperately scraping together Rory's health insurance premiums?

2. Relatedly, she signed Rory up for Chilton without checking out how much it would cost? How did she expect to pay for it? And if it's just the 'enrollment fee', why is she continually indebted to her parents?

3. (Saying this as an academic...) It's unbelievably irksome how everyone just talks as if Rory has already been accepted to Harvard. She seems like a smart girl, but admission there is a crapshoot and it's 95% likely that she'd be rejected. She seems like a straight-up unhooked white girl. In real life, this would be an unbearably cruel thing to do -- setting her up for heartbreak.

4. We are given no indication whatsoever that Rory is in any way suited for being some kind of intrepid international journalist. She seems more like a meek homebody.

5. Lorelei is just a straight-up bitch to everyone sometimes, but especially her mother. Sometimes her mum is not very nice either, but more often than not I find myself siding with Emily. And Lorelei's whole ""I'm just going to derail the conversation by saying increasingly *quirky* and *random* things until people pay attention to me again"" act gets very old.

Then she was sad for about a week before moving on completely...not that the show was ever good with break up emotions aside from the Luke-Lorelei situation. 

We're lead to believe that Luke and Lorelei end up together, which IMO is shitty for Luke because Lorelei could never seem to be fully devoted to him even when he was devoted to her. After all, she did marry Christofer just after their breakup. 

Aside from that, it felt to me that Rory left for a job that she settled for. It seems like she took it because she had no other options and because they wanted to end the show ASAP.

I included a brief reason for why I picked each episode too. 

 I also have 11 honorable mentions because it was so damn hard to narrow it down to just 10...

Disclaimer: I am a huge Luke and Lorelai shipper, and that's definitely obvious from this list. It's just my opinion, I'm sure everyone has different favorites. 

*Top 10* 

**1. 4.22 Raincoats and Recipes**- Hands down best episode in the series. Theres simply no contest. Its absolutely the perfect episode. Like the Bracebridge dinner and Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving it features pretty much every single character in the show, but it ends with Luke and Lorelai making out and I just love it. 

**2. 4.14 The Incredible Sinking Lorelais**- I adore this episode. I think its one of Lauren Grahams best episodes because she goes through so many emotions and she really does a great acting job. Of course I love the Luke and Lorelai interactions and its nice to see Dean taking care of Rory again.

**3. 5.3 Written in the Stars-** Probably the cutest/sweetest episode in the series. Luke and Lorelai finally have sex, and their date beforehand is so cute, and then the town meeting is ridiculous but funny. I love it.

**4. 3.19 Keg! Max!-** This is a great episode, mainly because it doesnt focus solely on Lorelai and Rory. A big part of it is about Jess and Dean, and their fight at the keg party is fucking awesome to watch. I love the whole episode because it has the throwback of Max, finally deals with the is Rory having sex or nah question, and is filled with drama.

**5. 2.13 A-Tisket, A-Tasket**- This is one of the best relationship episodes. First of all, Jackson and Sookie get engaged which is so cute. It also has Rorys relationship with Dean and her relationship with Jess juxtaposed nicely, and theres some very cute Luke and Lorelai interactions. 

**6. 6.13 Friday Nights Alright for Fighting**- In terms of acting, this is the best episode, hands down. Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop especially. The last 10 minutes of this episode where theyre all at Friday night dinner, fighting and laughing and yelling, is simply amazing. The way it was written, the acting, the director and the producers all did such a good job on this one.

**7.	5.13 Wedding Bell Blues**- This episode is a total train wreck in terms of the characters lives, but its so well done and so entertaining. I love watching everyones interactions, and the shit that goes down in this episode is crucial for the rest of the series.

**8.	3.7 They Shoot the Gilmores, Dont They?**- Ah, the 24 hour dance marathon. This episode is so infuriating to me because of how Rory acts towards Dean but I also love it because Dean finally stands up for himself. He was always such a good boyfriend to Dean and in my (unpopular) opinion he was too good for Rory (although that changes and he becomes a total dick). 

**9.	2.10 The Bracebridge Dinner**- Everyone loves this episode, and for good reason. Out of all of the episodes in the entire series it features the most characters because literally everyone is in it. Its a fun episode with a little bit of drama but overall just a good time.

**10.	3.9 A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving**- Like the Bracebridge dinner, this episode features pretty much every character. But this episode does a better job of really showcasing each characters personalities, especially their flaws and strengths. Its a fun episode and always makes me want to try deep-fried turkey. 

*Honorable Mentions (in chronological order)*

1.8 Love &amp; War &amp; Snow- I mainly love this episode because of Lorelai and Maxs date. I think its so adorable and their make out scene on the stairs is kind of hot. Its also great because it does a really good job of showing early on that Rorys relationship with Emily and Richard is way different from their relationship with Lorelai. It also shows that Rory can be pretty self-centered and is the beginning of her putting boys before everything else in her life.

1.14 That Damn Donna Reed- This episode is all around just hilarious and so cute. Its one of my favorite Rory and Dean episodes, but its important because its trying to show that Rory and Lorelai are not at all a conventional family and that they do what they want, how they want, when they want. Also has some super adorable Luke and Lorelai moments and is one of the first episodes foreshadowing their relationship.

3.13 Dear Emily and Richard- The flashback episode! It deserves an honorable mention because this is the only episode that features Young Lorelai and Young Christopher, and its just very entertaining.

4.7 The Festival of Living Art- This episode also deserves an honorable mention because its all about Stars Hollow and really shows the small town feel better than any other episode. Its also a very unique episode because its entirely based on one event, and its pretty funny.

4.15 Scene in a Mall- Honorable mention just because of Kelly Bishop. Her acting in this episode is truly phenomenal. This episode describes Emily Gilmore perfectly. Its everything you need to know about her, and its fucking perfect.

4.21 Last Week Fights, This Week Tights- This episode is just a fun one. Its so cute because Luke and Lorelai are finally getting it together, the wedding is fun to watch, and I kind of like it when Luke gets all mad at Lorelai for being judgmental about the book.

5.14 Say Something- Honorable mention because of one line is this episodeRory says to Lorelai (about Luke) he waited forever for you, hes not just gonna walk away. I loved that line since the first time I heard it and its so true and great and just sums up Luke and Lorelais relationship perfectly.

6.21 Driving Miss Gilmore- This is a great one, again because of Kelly Bishop. She is so hilarious in this episode when shes being a drama queen, and I love it. But when she tells Lorelai that she wants to buy her and Luke a house, I lose it every time. It shows how much their relationship has grown and changed over the years, and it proves that Emily really loves Lorelai and wants to be close with her more than anything.

6.22 Partings- This one gets an honorable mention because even though I hate to admit it, I legit cry every time. When Logan leaves for London, and he gets up early and doesnt wake Rory and then the whole elevator scene happensugh, its just so sad and so cute I cant help it. 

7.20 Lorelai? Lorelai?- Lorelais karaoke performance is my favorite part of season 7 and one of my favorite parts of the whole show. Its filled with such raw emotion and I just love it. I remember the first time I watched this episode it was like 4 am and I just didnt know what to do with myself afterwardsI had the chills and I was freaking out because I was actually so enthralled with Luke and Lorelais relationship and I didnt know if they ended up together. 

7.22 Bon Voyage- Although I hate season 7 and I overall hate how the show ended, I have to include this episode. It somewhat redeemed the final season and I was okay with it. Although the ending was so rushed and stupid, everything Luke did for Rorys goodbye party is just such a great representation of what kind of guy he is and how much he loves both of the Gilmore girls. And I love the fact that Rory said no to Logan, because for once she actually didnt let her feelings for a guy control her life. 

So that's pretty much it! Lastly, I know that a lot of people really love 6.5 We've Got Magic to Do because of Emily ripping Shira a new one (which is awesome) but I didn't include it because personally I think that episode is kinda meh. Mainly because I think Rory (and everyone else) completely overacted to how the Huntzberger family treated her. Boo-hoo, someone doesn't like Rory for once... who cares. 

Anyway, thanks for reading! I hope I inspired some people to go back and rewatch these episodes :) ",8,18,False,self,,,,,
