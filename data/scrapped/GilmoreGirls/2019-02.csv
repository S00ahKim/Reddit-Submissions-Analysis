I had always thought of Mrs. Kim as a widower or as a single/divorced mom, since we never see Lanes dad.

And Rory at some point also refers to both of them. But we never ever see the dad, (not even at Lanes wedding? Not completely sure about this one since I havent gotten that far yet) and then later we stop hearing about him a lot and is just Mrs. Kim. 

Also, in the episode when Lane is feeling jealous of the new Korean girl taking her place at her house and she breaks in in the middle of the night and kisses her mom while she is asleep, they clearly show that Mrs. Kim is sleeping alone.

Having just gotten into the meat of **season 5**, I couldn't help but think about the inconsistencies regarding Rory and Dean's relationship. The season beings with them showing signs of still being in love and Dean not being happy in his marriage. All fine and dandy. If Rory still loves Dean, that's fine. If Dean still loves Rory, that's fine. It's not the most original material, but it's fine.

Cut to a couple of episodes later and they finally have sex. Good for them. Now apparently Rory and Dean are set up for a new relationship because Lindsay breaks up with Dean. 

Dean was the absolute worst to Lindsay, so her demanding divorce makes sense. What doesn't make sense is how quickly Dean and Rory fall out of love again. I just finished episode 7 of season 5, so I'm not sure how this resolves, but I'm shocked that the writers are already focused on splitting up Rory and Dean and pushing her towards Logan. To me, that is poor storytelling. All that pining Rory and Dean did just to have it end immediately? 

Dean literally wasted away his marriage for a three episode fling, what an idiot! Lindsay was great to him! 

I started thinking a bit more about this, and I realized that maybe Rory and Dean weren't necessarily still in love, but they just had sexual curiosities about each other that couldn't be satiated. Maybe once the sex was out of the picture, all loose threads were tied up? My thinking on this was that Rory was clearly ready to start having sex in college, but didn't want to wait for a legitimate relationship to form at Yale, so she subconsciously pushed herself towards Dean?

That logic doesn't really work as well with Dean since we can assume he lost his virginity to Lindsay at some point, but the idea of there still being sexual curiosities with Rory makes sense. This just makes Dean even more of an asshole, but it is relatively accurate in regards to how some dudes think. 

Either way, this makes both Rory and Dean extremely selfish since Lindsay's life get's destroyed in the process. But since when do the writers care about Lindsay?

**TLDR**: Either the writers fumbled this storyline completely or after having sex a couple of times, Rory and Dean realized they had tied up all loose ends regarding their relationship and could finally move on.

I never watched the series when it was on originally, Ive only ever binge-watched it on Netflix. Im doing that for the second time now and Im seeing it completely differently since spending a lot of time on the raised by narcissists sub. 

Emily has such some extreme narcissistic tendencies: except for when she had to deal with Trix, all she thinks about is herself and what makes her happy, it doesnt matter what anyone else feels, wants, or thinks, especially Lorelai and Rory  she always has to have her way or she goes into manipulation and guilt overdrive. Shes completely incapable of seeing things from anyone elses point of view, and she has no sense of personal boundaries and interferes outrageously in Lorelais and Rorys life - their relationships, the common room in Rorys dorm, etc.

**Shes a bully**, *and everyone around her enables the hell out of her*, theyve taught her she can get away with it because they rarely set any boundaries with her.

Lorelai is generally very passive aggressive, and uses snarkiness as a way to try to feel like she has any power in her relationship with her mother. She does occasionally set boundaries with Emily, and sometimes actually sticks to them, but other times she completely gives into Emilys machinations  the enabling behavior. She is highly codependent in that she has internalized the belief that shes responsible for other peoples feelings, especially her parents, and shes passed this on to Rory.

Rory is even worse. Shes completely codependent, she cant set any boundaries at all and feels completely responsible for everybody elses feelings, and she constantly blames herself for things that are clearly outside of her control. The first time I watched the series I thought she was adorable, now I almost literally feel nauseated half the time when she opens her mouth. 

And ironically, despite Lorelais and Rorys indignation at how far Emily goes to disrupt, manipulate and control their relationships, *they almost immediately turned around and did the same thing to her* to try to get Richard and her back together. Hypocrite much?

Its fascinating and horrible at the same time, like watching a train wreck.",14,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm conflicted here even as I write this because this plot was meant to show that Rory wasn't perfect and that she was capable of making mistakes. Her mom pointed out her mistakes, but then once Rory recognized it, she backed off and then started coddling her. I don't know. I feel like once Lorelai backed off, the plot went back to coddling Rory, making her feel perfect again, and she never got the character growth that was really necessary here. She got into a relationship with the man whose marriage she ended, and then later in life, she had an affair with Logan who was engaged. She also cheated on her boyfriend Paul. I feel like this was a pivotal moment in her life that was too easily swept under the rug after she offhandedly admitted it was stupid, but she never felt any consequences for it. Later in life, she didn't seem ashamed to be a cheating party. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's not on Lorelai to open Rory's eyes to what's right and what's wrong, especially now that Rory is an adult, but Lorelai has the biggest influence on Rory. If anyone was gonna help Rory steer her moral compass in a different direction, it would've been her mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:  I feel that if Lorelai wouldn't have immediately started coddling Rory after she realized her error of ways, Rory may have held onto her acknowledge that sleeping with a married man was wrong. Her character growth to prove she was imperfect was dashed quickly. ",5,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

How do you feel about that? Does it ever get to you?

In one of the last episodes I watched, Lane mentioned Christian rock in the genres that shouldn't exist/be played. I know she's in a rock band, but Christian rock can be really good.

Lorelei called about Jess...
""Lorelai: It involves the J-word. 
Rory: Oh, not more about Jesus. I'm sick of him and Mel Gibson.""

Emily mentioned she had a Christian bumped off a flight so she could fly to Europe and then added that she'd get another Baptist bumped off so Rory could go with last minute.

Those are just a few, all from the few episodes I watched last night.

There was also an episode where Luke and Lorelei break into a Christian church and plan to break the bell so it wouldn't ring anymore.

And this post excludes other reasons why this isn't a Christian show because there are plenty. This show is played on the Up network, and it's supposed to be wholesome. I didn't like when they showed Bachelor and Bachelorette parties both having strippers. Or that Rory's first time was with a married man and Lane cheered her on for it although she was raised Christian. I realize they're best friends, but she was overly happy about the awful situation Rory was in. It doesn't matter that Dean was unhappy in his marriage or only 19, it was still wrong, and by doing that to Rory it proved that he didn't really love or care about her.

I have liked watching this show otherwise, so please don't hate on me. There are some good things about this show. I just don't think it should be marketed as Christian when it's not.

Rory goes to visit her professor's office hours under the guise of ""asking him about the lecture"" when she really wants to discuss her paper. When she walks in, she introduces herself by name and tells him which class of his she attends (this is important). He susses out why she's actually there, finds her paper, and begins to discuss it with her.

First of all, he *immediately* remembers Rory's paper without having to skim it or have her remind him of the points she made. He just automatically knows who she is and what she wrote, despite having no personal interactions with her before she walked into his office five seconds before. This is super unrealistic since freshman lectures at Yale are probably pretty large.

Worse, though, is that he not only remembers Rory's paper, exactly, down to the specific extraneous topic she included, *he somehow recognized from her paper that she was overworked and* ***looked at her class schedule.*** This doesn't even begin to make sense. He doesn't know Roryhe's never even personally met herand yet, he has the immediate impression that she is taking too many classes and goes as far as to look at her schedule. To top it off, he then meets with her advisor and discusses his concerns!

Not only am I unsure if professors even have the resources/ability to look into a student's information that way, but why would he even try? It's not like this is a professor Rory has a longstanding relationship with, has taken multiple classes with, has had discussions with, been to office hours, etc. From what we can tell, this is the first time he's even learned her name.

I appreciate the writers giving Rory a sort of ""Chilton moment"", like when she received a bad grade after starting there, but the way the scene with the professor plays is just so unrealistic.

On the whole, Rory is still a good person--flawed, certainly, but good at heart; her kindness, intelligence, and hard work are far more pronounced parts of her character than her shortcomings. 

Much of this stems, I think, from the fact that so many viewers identified strongly with Rory during the initial series. When she behaved badly in the revival (which, no question, she did), they felt disenfranchised and began to pick apart every decision and mistake she made in the original. The hate is a reaction to her long-believed perfection; if Rory hadn't been held to such a high standard, the vitriol wouldn't be so extreme. (To contrast this, look at Emily or Paris, both far worse people than Rory who are essentially let off the hook by viewers for their bad behavior.)

Does this make her feel more in control of her life, which she never felt living in the Gilmore house?

EG : During the sweater scene in season 1 , she says - don't take my things without asking. That was not for the sweater that was for Richard and Emily.

This is often touted as being one of Rory's most egregious flaws, but the more I think about her character, the more I just don't see it. This is probably gonna be long, so bear with me.

Rory is thought of as being entitled for several reasons: the (in)famous ""he's Dean, my Dean!"", going to Chilton and Yale, being allowed to live rent-free in Emily and Richard's lavish pool house when she dropped out, not having to hold down a job while in school (sans brief card-swiping), etc. Rory is definitely privileged, especially from age 16+, despite the fact that she doesn't consider herself privileged. She is rightfully called on this by Logan after she writes the article dismissing his group of friends as vapid, superficial, etc. However, Rory being given money and opportunity by her grandparents did not make her entitled, in my opinion.

Before the age of 18, Rory really has no control over what she is given. Lorelai goes to her parents for money for Chilton, and other than that, Rory does not live a very extravagant life. Though we come to see the girls at a more comfortable time in their life, it is definitely implied and often explicitly stated that they regularly scrimped while Rory was growing up. They literally lived in a shed. Rory was shown a great role model in Lorelai. Everything they had was because Lorelai worked hard and Rory learned the value of that. Throughout these years, we see that Rory has an incredibly work ethic. Maybe within the confines of the show, we aren't actually *shown* her studying for more than a few minutes per episode, because it'd be boring, but we are essentially supposed to assume that Rory is studying basically every minute we're not seeing her on screen. It is a fact that she has an amazing work ethic when it comes to school. She doesn't feel entitled to attending Harvard and knows that she has to earn it. Her work at Chilton earns her the praise of many adults, including the headmaster.

The first time Rory has the opportunity to show her entitlement to a sum of money, she does everything in her power to decline it. She actively refuses Lorelai's offer to use the Richard money to pay for Yale. She offers to apply for student loans from the bank. She places herself in debt to her grandparents' in order to spare Lorelai the money to buy the Dragonfly. She places a harsher repayment plan on herself than Richard would have. She is completely unwilling to receive the money as a gift.

Regarding her other moments of material entitlement, she was just accepting kindness from people who loved her. I don't think most people would expect their grandparents' to charge them rent. I know many people who live with their significant others rent-free or for a significantly lower price due to an income disparity. Hell, how do we know Logan even paid for or is paying for that apartment? He doesn't have a solid, steady job for a while; it is highly likely any money he has came from Mitchum, anyway. Additionally, while living with Paris, Rory lets her have her way. When they moved in to their second dorm at Yale, Paris switched their rooms while Rory was away because she wanted the bigger room with more light, and Rory didn't complain.

Furthermore, I don't find her emotional entitlement to be *that* atrocious, especially considering it's a realistic character flaw, especially for a young girl who has grown up sort of charmed in that department. She is used to receiving positive feedback from her mother, her teachers, her grandparents, etc. When she receives negative feedback from a professor, or from Mitchum, she acts out because she is simply not used to it. In Rory's mind hard work equates to success. Since she hasn't slacked off on the tasks on which she has received bad marks, she feels that she *earned* a good grade, a good review, whatever. In most school-related situations, however, when the initial shock wears off, she just ends up working harder. She doesn't even want a grade she thinks she hasn't earned when she assumes Asher gave her a high mark just because of Paris. The Mitchum situation is the only one that she never really fully recovers from, but her feelings were hurt. Not only is her boss disparaging her lifelong dream, her boyfriend's father is, as well, after she's had a terrible reception with the rest of his family.

The last point is Rory's big flaw, the thing most people hate about her: her penchant for infidelity. It is, in my opinion, Rory's worst trait. As previously stated, however, I think her proclivity for cheating comes from insecurity and ignorance, rather than an intent to hurt anyone. It is selfish, of course, but when she tells Lorelai, ""he's Dean, my Dean!"", I think people tend to forget who Rory is at this time. She's a 19-year-old girl whose entire life has changed within the last year. She moved out for the first time. She lives away from all of her best friends. She has Paris, but their relationship is complicated and not as supportive for Rory as her relationships with Lane and Lorelai. She's had a semi-difficult time adjusting at Yale. She is looking for comfort and she finds it with someone is incredibly familiar to her. She's just lost her virginity to her first love, someone who ""taught her what safe feels like"", and is immediately criticized by Lorelai in an incredibly vulnerable time. Rory doesn't double down on this attitude after, though. She doesn't proceed through this arc with entitlement for Dean. She removes herself from the equation and tells Dean to consider his relationship with Lindsay without factoring her in as a variable.

Her relationship with Logan in the revival has less background, but I do think it falls into the similar pattern of Rory running to her loved ones for comfort. She is obviously struggling, floundering in her career, and Logan is a familiar source of love. It is likely that Rory rationalizes it by reaffirming to herself that Logan doesn't really love his fiance and it's all just part of the ""dynastic plan"", but it is still selfish.

TL;DR Ultimately, I don't believe that Rory is as entitled as she is made out to be at times. I think, at her core, she is a generous, empathetic person who receives very harsh criticism for a lot of things that are out of her control. Her material privilege is really not her fault and she does her best to counteract it and become a generous, appreciative person. She works hard for her academic success, and while she does sustain shock when it doesn't pay off, she usually just works harder. In my opinion, it is really only the emotional entitlement she holds toward her ex-boyfriends that is as terrible as people say.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

- Lorelai trying to negotiate buying the Dragonfly DURING THE OWNERS FUNERAL. 
- The way Lorelai acts towards her parents in general
-The jokes Lorelai is constantly making in serious situations  arent quirky theyre disrespectful 
- Lorelai abandoning Max before the wedding. The way she treats her boyfriends in general is awful.

Just rewatched the first Jess episode, and it struck me how hes a character foil of Max. 
Bear with me: Jess challenged Rory. He pushed her to be more thoughtful, particularly when it came to literature and seeing the world through that lens. He also got her, meaning, he met her on her level of humor and intelligence, whereas Max (and Dean, now that I mention it) tolerated and was amused by a Gilmore girl but never really engaged with her on that level. For example when max and dean are talking about how to date a GG while the girls got ice cream, Dean had to instruct Max to just go with their bits, as if neither of them really understood the girls senses of humor but rather tolerated it. Jess interacted with Rorys wit and reciprocated it. Max was an admirer, Jess was a participant. 
Just as we are disappointed that max and lor didnt end up, or at least I was, we see what its like for a GG to interact with someone who truly gets them and can keep up with them. So for me anyway, it replaced the hope for the girls that Lorelais bailing on Max had lost.

She watched it every night before bed no matter how busy she was. I always joked about how the way they spoke annoyed me but one night I asked her if I could watch with her because I just wanted to spend time with her and try to understand her love for the show. After that we watched at least one episode a night but I never got to finish the whole series. Its been about 7 years and I only remember Jess coming into the show and absolutely loving Cat Kirk for some reason. Anyway, she was such an intelligent, charming, and goal-oriented person who came into my life at the perfect time because I was quite the opposite and needed a good influence to push me into the right direction. I have always considered her my first love. 


Last June I graduated from college but I felt more lost than ever. The contract job I was looking forward to fell through, my love life was in shambles, and I felt like all my hard work wasnt good enough. I thought about her and how she changed my life and I just felt the urge to watch Gilmore Girls again because it was comforting to her and I needed that. I finally finished the original series last week after a few months of watching from the beginning and I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I still love Cat Kirk but Id have to say my favorite character is Emily and I think Kelly Bishop is so intoxicating in every scene.



Anyway, I have no doubt that Ill be rewatching again soon. It really did comfort me and I'm doing better in life now. I've been having fun reading this subreddit and seeing everyone elses opinions on different aspects of the show and its nice that I finally understand everything. Also, I have seen people mention a Gilmore Guys podcast and I think Im going to give that a try too! I'm a fan for sure and I understand why this show is loved so much.

They did not deserve the constant sarcastic remarks Lorelai threw at them.

1. We all know Lorelai was a smart mouth (even during the flashbacks) and I cannot agree that Lorelai would have sat down quietly in a situation she was not happy with. So her whole ""oh my parents are hitler"" bit and ""I had to suffer"" is way overrated.
2. I don't see how any parents would have reacted differently if their 16 year old kid gets pregnant. R&amp;E reacted the same way anyone would. Infact if Lorelai would have been in their shoes she would have been much worse (coming from ""I have got the good kid"" statement when Paris had sex implying how badly she thought of her kid having sex) I don't think Lorelai would have been the quirky mom she is if Rory got pregnant at 16. R&amp;E provided for her and wanted her to have a safe settle life how is that wrong? She was 16 for god sake. Marriage does not mean she could have gone on a Europe trip and sleep on a bench , or that she could not have. a career. It could have just mean that she had at least one part of her life figured out as being pregnant at 16 must be overwhelming. 
3. Now I get it if she didn't want to get married. Fine no problem. But leaving for deliver baby without informing anyone? how did she drive the car? That was not a mature decision. Its not just her but even the baby's life she put in danger. That was not a cool rebilous move that was a STUPID move. first of all she was stupid enough to get pregnant at 16 and then even was obnoxious about it.
4. The ""oh my parents ruin everything"" bit. What exactly did they ruin so much for her? Gave her life ? wanted her to have a coming out party? wanted her to wear expensive clothes? way to ruin a life huh!
5. Running for money for Rory's education but snapping out if Richard has any view on colleges for Rory. Harvard was clearly the choice because Lorelai didn't wanted Richard's legacy to continue. Blaming the people without the proof , well thats what an ungrateful person does.
6. The whole Luke breakup thing. No it was not Emily's fault. It was Lorelai. Why did she hide the fact from Luke? There relationship was so weak that one person presence was enough to break it up. Lorelai just needed someone to blame it on while it was clearly her fault. 
7. Her snapping at Emily for the wifi thing at the salon. Totally uncalled for.
8. The whole loan thing and how rude she was to Emily while she was only helping her out which mind you she did finally took.
9. Her talk at Richard's funeral. That was the final nail. And her defence was she was caught offgaurd. seriously! he was her father for god sake who helped her financially and stood up for her when need be ( when Chris's parents came for dinner) and all she could say for him was that. She was ungrateful always.

What Loralai had was ""I AM SO RICH and I don't like it"" syndrome. Girl people don't have money to send their kids to prep school , people don't get 75,000$ check on birthday be grateful. This ""MY PARENTS ARE RICH AND THEY ARE AWFULL"" feeling is also a privilege only 1% of this earth's population has. So stop with his obnoxious behaviour.

Ya she made a life for her but remember she always had a net and she made use of that safety net too.

- Though Rory has many flaws, I dont think her privilege is one of them. To some she comes across as ungrateful and expectant of special treatment but I think she accepted help and assistance gracefully. I dont think she was nearly as spoiled as people made her out to be. She regularly did things to help/assist the town, she regularly enjoyed simple foods, her style was very down to earth and she never looked down on others for lack of means. Yes she accepted financial help but if someone was offering to pay your way through school would you not accept? 

- Many dislike Logan for his pompous entitled attitude but for me what made me not ship him and Rory was the lack of emotional depth in their relationship. It is often overlooked. They didnt really seem to have any deep bonding moments. Their relationship to me seemed very surface level. I kept thinking it would evolve past the casual dating stage but up until he proposed to her I still didnt see much of a connection beyond attraction. The only real shining moment to me was when Richard was in the hospital. 

- I really wish they had given Lane a better storyline. Her and Zachs relationship fell flat to me and you could totally see her unhappiness with the domestic life. I know she was just a supporting character but I really wish something more noteworthy happened. Her and Dave had such chemistry, too bad the actor left. I would have liked to see some kind of love triangle and maybe Lane having an opportunity to leave the band for higher music prospects. 

- Many think Lorelei was a commitment phobe but I think she was just very sure and who and what she wanted. Seeing that she raised Rory alone, she wasnt going to settle for someone that wasnt a good fit for her. She knew very early on that she wanted to marry Luke, shes very insistent when shes sure about something.   

- I always see people reprimanding Rory for the Dean/cheating situation (note: I know her behavior was wrong) but to me what was far more cringeworthy was Paris openly cheating on Jamie and having no remorse for it. Rory might have been foolish and fell for the typical Im gonna leave her guy game but Paris repeatedly had an affair with another guy and relentlessly strung Jamie along until brutally dumping him over the phone in a smug manner. Rewatching that episode I realized just how cringeworthy it was. 

- Paris and Doyle kinda sucked. No chemistry, relentless fighting, Doyles whiny voice was like nails against a chalkboard. I ended up getting anxiety during their scenes instead of butterflies.

192,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2019-2-18,2019,2,18,12,arsn8c,self.GilmoreGirls,Why I think Fall brings the series to a perfect conclusion,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/arsn8c/why_i_think_fall_brings_the_series_to_a_perfect/,HeartRiseAbove,1550460217,"I know the Revival gets a lot of criticism, and of course I agree that it isnt perfect by any means, but I think Fall was such a perfect ending to the series, and an brilliant episode overall that brought to a satisfying conclusion the arcs of the four central characters (Lorelai, Rory, Luke and Emily).

LORELAI  By getting her out of her comfort zone, she finally gains some perspective on her life and how lucky she is. I think much of her problematic behavior throughout the revival  including the distance from Luke and Rory  was brought by her grief over Richards death, and her ability to come to terms with it brings her back to her normal, happy self. By the end, she has decided to expand her business, strengthen her commitment to the man whos stuck with her through everything and mend her relationship with her mother.

RORY  I thought that Rorys main problems in the Revival were rooted in a lack of passion and aimlessness. So its fitting that by the end of it shes got two major purposes thatll keep her on her toes: the book and motherhood. I also like that though she indulges in the bliss of nostalgia for simpler times e.g. to the LDB and Logan, she finally makes the choice to stand on her two feet and get through the rough patches of adulthood without a security blanket.

LUKE  His speech was great, because it showcases his devotion to Lorelai and that he really would do anything for her. Their time apart spent in the beginning of the episode also shows that, much as they have their issues, hes practically lost without her. And I think that his fear of her leaving him is colored by his own experience on abandonment: almost everybody hes loved has left him - his parents died young, her sister left him as soon as she had the chance, Rachel came in and out of his life, Jess left him as well - its no wonder that she thinks Lorelai, who hes loved more than anyone, is going to leave him too. That makes it all the more awesome when he assures her that he will never leave her.

EMILY  I thought it was lovely to see her and Lorelai repair their relationship and bond over their love for Richard. For so long, her identity has been directly tied to being his wife and now shes left on her own, she is feeling utterly lost until she manages to find herself again and breaks free of the social constraints of her world and ends up someplace happy.

TL;DR: I love the characters journey and where they end up.

Lorelai marrying Chris in Paris

I had a question throughout the entire season. Does Lorelai love Max or Luke or Christopher? When she told Rory she'd always love Christopher, did she mean it in the way that a first love has a special place in one's heart? Then once Max was gone, Luke came in the picture and the show made it seem as though she'd loved Luke even before Max.

My dad got me into gilmore  girls when I was 12 or so. I'm a guy, 18 now. He had slipped a disc (back problem) so was whacked out on painkillers and on bedrest. He ended up finding GG on one of those sitcom/dramedy channels. He got all 7 seasons for his birthday/christmas. I quickly became a huge fan.

I've heard a lot of interesting opinions on this sub, so I thought I'd share some of mine:

1. Lorelai is a complicated character. So is Emily. So is Rory. And that's what makes them utterly brilliant. I'm never always rooting for them; sometimes I outright despise them. None of them have just one motive. There's more to think about than just ""Lorelai and Emily are different people and Lorelai and Rory get along like best friends"". Do I always like Lorelai? No, sometimes she's inconsiderate and selfish. Do I always like Rory? No, she lacks maturity and empathy in her romantic relationships a lot of the time. Do I always see Emily as the antagonist? No, I might side with Lorelai in a lot of their arguments but other times, Emily is the one who makes sense, or Lorelai is simply making a big deal out of nothing.
2. The revival was incredible. I absolutely love it and I'm really hoping we'll get a second season where Rory will grow as a person in motherhood and Lorelai and Emily will fix their relationship. Was it perfect? No. Did Lorelai and Rory act entitled and selfish at points? Definitely. But my first point still stands. I found Rory to be very relatable in the revival. She definitely wasn't perfect, but each of her actions made sense to me, even sleeping with Logan (as Lorelai says, he's the guy she ""just can't quit"").
3. Season 7 wasn't a weak season. It started out a bit rough, mainly due to the change in the writing staff, absence of ASP etc. but from episode 12 or so to the end, I have very few complaints.
4. While we're on season 7... Lorelai and Christopher's marriage was a brilliant ending to their relationship's arc. They explain it perfectly in 'Farewell My Pet' - Chris was always a possibility for Lorelai, but he was never 'the one'. They rushed into the marriage, and I think part of the reason behind that, was that Chris knew it wasn't right, that she belonged with Luke, and so he just wanted to tie her down as quickly as possible.
5. Lorelai and Luke's best chemistry was in the first three seasons... when they weren't actually together. Somehow, being in a relationship together took something away from their chemistry.
6. April was an okay addition to the show. I'm not saying I loved her, but I didn't hate her either. Honestly, Luke and Lorelai needed a hurdle. Imagine how boring season 7 and the revival would be if Luke and Lorelai got married at the end of season 6. And as characters go, April and Luke's relationship was brilliant, and seeing him fight for custody of her in season 7 was pretty moving.",8,27,False,self,,,,,

* Lorelai is an immature child/brat that really needs some intensive therapy. Her conduct at the dinner at the Gilmore house was cringe worthy (I was embarrassed for her). The inappropriate jokes and the tantrum she threw (in front of all of the guests) when she found out the Rory applied to Yale just made me dislike her even more.

She is guilty of the exact thing that she accuses Richard and Emily of but she uses guilt to manipulate her daughter. Richard and Emily have been there for her and Rory whenever they have needed help and she treats them like complete shit. 

*The *""this is my town""* comment that everyone likes to bash Dean for is taken completely out of context.

She decided not to tell Luke she was pregnant and never had any intention to do so, which in and of itself is, in my opinion, one of the worst things a person can do. Maybe the relationship didn't work out, maybe she didn't think he'd want to be involved, but at the very least, he had a right to know. Even if they'd had an awful, nasty break up, with cheating or something (which we have no evidence of), he'd still deserve to know about April, because unless there's been abuse, a father deserves to know about his kids. And what did she base this on? Him not liking crying babies in restaurants! I don't like crying babies in restaurants either, that doesn't mean that I'd be an unfit mother. Even if Anna had been sure she'd know his answer, even if she were right and he would have said 'I don't want to be involved', he still should have had the opportunity to make the choice for himself.

The way Luke kept April a secret and then didn't have her around Lorelai for most of season 6, that's on Luke (and bad writing, in my opinion), but Anna's reaction once she found out that Lorelai had been at April's birthday party? That is so over the line. Yeah, she's April's mother, but guess what? Luke is April's father. He has every right to make decisions about adults in April's life when she's with him. After my mother started dating, when I was about April's age, she didn't need to ask my father for permission before her boyfriend was allowed to meet me; she was my parent and was allowed to make that call for herself. Because my Dad's girlfriend ended up driving me to and from his place a few times, my mom did meet her pretty soon in, but she didn't interrogate her or anything, because there was an assumption of trust that my father wouldn't have let her drive me places or be alone with me if there were any possible cause for concern. If April were younger, and Luke were leaving her unattended with Lorelai, then I'd get Anna's hesitance a little more, but even then, Luke's proven to be a responsible guy. It's not like he's hanging around with crackheads and prostitutes who might say or do something harmful to April. Even if there'd just been a scene where Anna asked to meet Lorelai, I'd have thought that it was a little ridiculous that she thought that she could vet people who her child's father hung out with, but at least she'd have given an inch.

(I'd like to, at this point, say that my rules about 'one parent shouldn't try to control what the other parent does with their kid' goes out the window if there's ever been a history of any type of abuse or substance misuse, or something clearly dangerous or harmful going on, but since there hasn't been in this case, the rule stands.)

Then, when Lorelai tried to introduce herself to Anna, Anna told Lorelai that she just didn't want her to be around April at all unless she and Luke were married, because... Engagements fall apart all the time? WTF kind of logic is that? Marriages fall apart all the time. People die all the time. A marriage certificate is not a guarantee that things are going to last, and a lack of one is not a guarantee that things will end. And what a horrible way to introduce your kid to your partner! ""Hi, I'm your stepmom, your dad lives in my house now, and any time you visit, I'll be around, now smile, we're taking wedding photos here."" Was April supposed to meet Lorelai at the ceremony? Was she not going to be invited to the wedding, and only meet her after? Or would Anna's rule have a grace period so maybe April could meet her at the rehearsal dinner instead? What if Luke had been engaged to someone horrible, who April would have hated, and he wouldn't know until after they were married? I know people who were absolutely in love with their partner, but the way their partner treated their kids became a deal-breaker for the relationship. This rule makes absolutely no sense. And again, Anna might make that decision for how she's going to conduct her own relationships, but she doesn't get to tell Luke that that's how he's got to act too.

Then, after all that, once Luke and Lorelai are broken up, Anna suddenly has no problem with April spending two months living with Luke. During those two months, she sure did meet a lot of people who Luke's not married to. It's almost as if her behavior was only to drive a wedge between Luke and Lorelai, because she's possessive and insecure over April.

Finally, after everything that's happened, once April and Luke are starting to really bond, she decides that she's moving April to New Mexico. No discussion, no questions asked, and she's not even willing to work out a reasonable custody agreement. Then, when Luke tries to argue, she turns around and tells him that he doesn't even have a relationship with April because he wasn't present in the first twelve years of her life. UM. WHOSE FAULT IS THAT? She acts so surprised that he dared ask for a visitation schedule, too, and acts like he's being completely unreasonable. I'm not sure if she's just unaware of the planet she lives on, but while she's right that primary physical custody is usually given to the mother, especially since April never lived full-time with Luke, it's pretty damn common for the courts to give fathers joint legal custody these days. And once he has joint legal custody, she either needs permission from him or approval from the state before she moves out of state. She should be thanking him for being so reasonable and not trying to restrict her from making the move at all, but instead gets so toxic and tells April that she can't visit Luke at all, not even for Christmas, then throws his romantic history and his habits of solitude in his face during court, as if that could justify denying him access to his daughter.

Fortunately, the judge in the case has more than the half a braincell Anna seems to possess, so Luke gets his visitation. And hopefully this is the last I'll have to see of Anna on this show again.

I just genuinely cannot think of anything more toxic or evil to do to a former partner than to keep their child from them, willfully and maliciously. There are plenty of characters on the show that annoy the crap out of me, but I don't think that there are any that I genuinely hate more than Anna.",36,82,False,self,,,,,

Rory and Dean break up in late October/early November. Rory doesnt find out about Lindsay until the hockey game, but lets be generous and say Dean and Lindsay start dating in mid/late Nov. 

Dean tells Rory about the engagement around prom season, so May-ish, after dating six months max. 

Then we see that Lindsays mother is running around happily planning the wedding, which finally takes place not long after Rory starts Yale, so maybe late September or early November. 

When things begin to crack and Rory complains that Lindsay is making life difficult for Dean, she mentions Lindsay doesnt go to school or have a job and just sits home all day. 

I have to wonder what the thought process is here for Lindsays mom. What mother happily marries off her 18 year old daughter to the boy shes dated for less than a year, and doesnt encourage said daughter to work or go to school? The whole thing is so bizarre.

Obviously, Dean not being a virgin is not an issue. 

It's that both of them know he WAS a virgin when they were dating\* and the only reason he isn't now is because of Lindsay. His WIFE.

It made them feel more real. I love that the difficulties of a journalism career were represented and Rory ended up an author. I know its an unpopular opinion but i did prefer lorelai and christopher (he seemed more in sync with her humor) Luke looks like he just tolerates it or is mildly annoyed with it.

When Luke told Lorelai that Jess was coming to stay with him, he specifically told her that Jess's dad had run off and basically abandoned the family 2 or 3 years ago, that his sister was a nut job, and was just ridding herself of Jess and dumping him off on Luke to fix him so basically within 3 years, both of his parents abandoned Jess.  Lorelai seemed to have a firm understanding of Jess's situation yet when she busts him for swiping a beer, she comes off completely tone deaf and calls Jess on his attitude and tells him how lucky he has it and not to blow a good thing with Luke.  That just seems like a completely tone deaf thing to say to a kid when she knows that both of his parents recently abandoned him and he was just shipped off to a strange town with an uncle he barely knows and away from his friends.  Also, was this party a good idea to begin with?  It was his second day in town and she thinks Jess would welcome coming to a dinner party with people he doesn't even  know?  He's clearly angry that he was shipped off and having a difficult time dealing with his mom dumping him off on Luke.  I think Luke should have told Lorelai thanks but I don't think this dinner party is a good idea right now.  Let's hold off on that for awhile.   It was kind of Lorelai wanting to  do that for Jess but I don't think that is what he needed or wanted at that time. 

I also wished that when Jess asked Luke to play poker with him, that Luke would have said sure and played a few card games with him.  Jess was reaching out in that moment and Luke playing cards with him would have been a good first step in getting to know Jess, getting Jess to warm up and maybe even opening up to Luke a little, and starting to bond a little.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know some don't like Jess's attitude towards Lorelai after she busts him but I think she deserved it with that tone deaf speech.    She should have just asked for the  beer back and invited Jess to come back in side and eat.  She could have let Luke know she saw him take her beer and let Luke handle it the way he saw fit.   And then to tell Jess, she wished she had a cream pie to throw in his face?  Just ugh.  Jess should not have taken the beer but Lorelai shouldn't have told him how lucky he had it when she knew the situation surrounding his coming to town or told him she wanted to throw a pie in his face.

Don\`t get me wrong, the show establishes very early on that Rory is a good writer and I do not deny this. But she ultimately lacks certain crucial personality traits for her chosen profession and - in my opinion - this is a big reason for her unhappiness in the revival. After all Rory is a pretty introverted and high maintenance person, who seems to take criticism very personal and is not used to or good at facing crises. She also seemed to mostly want to become a journalist because she enjoys literature and working with language, but for the majority of journalists linguistic work is only a very small and often hardly appreciated part of the job.
