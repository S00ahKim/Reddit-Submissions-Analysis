If she did receive that money, it would make sense for her to own her house and to be able to afford her food habits when she's not working. Maybe she had no mortgage.

This show did such a wonderful job at getting you connected to all the characters (except a few, looking at you Anna!). I felt like I knew everyone who lived in Stars Hollow like they were my own neighbors. 

Another thing that Gilmore Girls did for me was reconnect me with old friends that I haven't spoken to in a while. I posted regularly on Facebook about watching the show giving my thoughts about what was going on, and my friend whom I hadn't spoken to very often started texting me asking my impressions as I carried on through the series.

Edit: Began this on my phone, but needed to finish it on my computer.

(Possible spoilers: sorry, not sure how to mark something a spoiler)

This show has stayed with like no other. It is flawed, like it's heroines (don't get me started on season 7, or April, or Jess leaving) but that's part of why I love it so much. These flaws make the Gilmore girls feel like real people, like friends. The characters grow, and develop, and make mistakes, and take chances, and fall down, and begin again all over again, with a cheerful lip gloss, flawless hair, and a quick-witted quip to hand. Witnessing their actions, gives me courage to keep persevering until I get my Dragon Fly Inn or dream travel-writing career. 

I studied English Literature, and focused primarily on rewritings of gender stereotypes. My main stereotypes were the ""fallen woman"" and the ""mother figure"". While writing my Masters thesis, watching this show and analysing the incredible mother and daughter relationships in the show was a welcome and guilt free (:p) break from my 50 000 word behemoth of a research project.

On my recent rewatching I thoroughly enjoyed the multiple well developed and strong female characters that people Star's Hollow. Gypsy the mechanic, the subversive Lane, Mrs Kim the powerhouse, Paris the incredible feminist heroine, Emily Gilmore standing up to that arse when he wanted Lorelai to have an abortion so Christophers life wouldnt be ruined So many examples... 

Stars Hollow itself is like the American Dream personified as a town. Growing up on the edge of a dusty mining town in the golden heart of South Africa, I certainly felt like I was Emily Gilmore wondering down in Wonderland when I joined the Gilmore girls for the first time. An awkward sixteen year old with my nose always pressed in a book,  I couldnt help but identify with Rory. I recently rewatched the show as a thirty year old, however, and found myself much more focused on Lorelais journey. That's the show's success, I think: evergreen issues and realistic characters.

It's my not so guilty pleasure, and I love it when my husband calls me his Gilmore girls when I'm hyped up and talking too excitedly about something.

So, confession time: how often have you revisited the Gilmore girls in Stars Hollow?

I hope I don't offend anyone by asking. ""Why does it matter?"" blah, blah, etc. I find it interesting though because if she is Asian she pulls off dyed hair much, much better than most Asian girls do, imo--her look is fairly seamless to me, while most dyed hair on Asians I find looks rather jarring (though coincidentally I thought Lane looked great in her purple hair, too, though I know that was a wig).

Anyway, this started when I moved away to college and discovered Gilmore Girls 10 years ago. I ended up buying the DVD's and watching the whole series, and have done so ever since. In a way I feel it got me through college (undergrad and graduate school). It was great background noise, and was always part of the back-to-school experience. And now it's a essential part of my life and is a comforting ritual.

I was expecting season 7 to be absolute trash like my friends warned and while it was sad, it wasn't all that bad. Sure, its obvious that stream of conscious style of dialogue goes away but the main plot points were good.

I did think it was weird that Rory wasn't at Christopher and Lorelai's wedding but Rory not being there is probably the only way she would have gone through with it. Rory is always Lorelai's sounding board and keeps her from floating away from earth, in my opinion. That wedding happened because Rory wasn't there to be her support.

Lorelai said she wanted to be married and have kids, so she did it. Not the way she wanted but isn't that the charm with our gilmore girls?! Independence and determination? I was a Luke/Lorelai shipper from the beginning but it was messed up the way he pushed her away and messed up that she went straight to her ex. But the things Luke says to her in 7 at the beginning like how he was indifferent to the break up, they never belonged together...damn. It is clear they just destroyed each other in that season and it is hard to watch. But I think some people mistake that sadness for bad writing and no it's not Amy but it certainly isn't bad. I think it gave more insight that Luke/Lorelai did belonged together because they both were so broken that whole season and still gravitated towards each other like they did in the olden days of their friendship. 

I also liked that after all of Luke's relationships ending because of Lorelai...her marriage ended because of Luke-I see what they did there and I like it. 

Then, just when we are thinking-is Logan still in this?!? Is Rory just going to ironically take on the life her mom ran away from?? Nope- she picks her career over him and that made me want to clap. The finale was perfect in my opinion. We had funny scenes with the beloved townspeople. Lorelai finally realizes her mom just wants to be in her life and she will continue the dinners. Then, we finally see the old, sweet Luke...pining after Lorelai again and going out of his way for her (looking at cars)...wanting to fix her bike with bells, but she, ""Wants a horn!"" (One of my favorite Lorelai moments btw). I just thought it ended the way it began, super John Hughesy and cute af.

Now, I do prefer the ASP's writing of course but let's give it up for the cast and crew keeping the soul of the show alive. Now I guess y'all can come at me with your pitchforks :P",13,18,False,self,,,,,
