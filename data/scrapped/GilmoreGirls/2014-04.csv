Just got to the woefully sad second-to-last episode of the third season where Jess takes off to California to see Jimmy (his dad).

I read years ago on the WB/CW forums that, at the time, this was the set up to a Milo Ventimiglia-helmed spin-off based on Jess's life on the West Coast and his new relationship with his dad. Anyone know if this was the case? Did they shoot a pilot and not get it picked up? Makes me wonder if they would have chosen to write Jess out of the show (effectively) had they not planned to give Milo his own series.",9,16,False,self,,,,,

I'm starting to go back to my obsessively analytic fanatic self of yesteryear and am longing for an outlet. Forums are obviously obsolete, so hopefully you all won't mind indulging me in a nitpicky-as-fuck post (this is a safe place, right? ;) ).  


I've always been curious about the timeline of Lorelai running away from home and where she and Rory lived, more specifically the time between her living at the Inn and getting her own house. It was implied in season 3 ""Dear Richard and Emily"" that she left Hartford when Rory was around 6 months old and found the Independence Inn 30 miles away in Stars Hollow. In season 1 we discovered that, upon first running away to the Inn, Fran allowed L&amp;R to live in the potting shed out back. Additionally, Sookie comments in Season 1 that Lorelai didn't know about Luke dating Rachel because she was ""just moving in"" to her house at the time and had a ""10 year old."" 

So are we to assume that Lorelai and Rory spent 10 years living in a potting shed? I always personally thought, back in the day, that it was their temporary home until Lorelai made a little money and could get an apartment, but they never really implied any other living situation aside from those two. 


Then there's the whole ""8 years"" Luke and Lorelai relationship. Luke says he had been holding onto the astrology card since the day they met, which was 8 years from season 5, 3 years before the pilot, making Rory 13. So Lorelai not only didn't know Rachel when they moved in, but I guess avoided going to Luke's diner for three years, unless he didn't open it until then, but that timeline was always ambiguous too. 


That was a bit tangential and rambly, I apologize, but what do you all think? Just continuity errors, or am I missing something? Or perhaps it's just how ASP intended it, which would make me a little suspicious, especially with Lorelai and Rory enduring a potting shed for 10 years of their life. They were troopers, but that's even a little far fetched for the master scrimpers. ",12,35,False,self,,,,,

The rigid interests, Emily's apparent inability to read facial expressions or body language, rigid set of interests and strict routines, lack of emotional closeness to her daughter, inappropriate behavior, etc. (in no way am I implying all autistic people have the traits of being emotionally cold or rude.)  If I don't look at the characters from this perspective they just come across as insensitive and Emily is actually kind of cruel.
    Or maybe I'm off and she could be better described as having OCD personality disorder (not OCD itself)...
  Richard Gilmore also has these rigid, cold traits but he connects so warmly to Rory and does seem to be able to have friends and bond to some people.
  Kirk, Luke and a few other characters also seem to have autistic traits, in fact Kirk is almost a caricature of what used to be known as Asperger's Syndrome: http://m.livescience.com/37333-dsm-aspergers-disorder.html

Here's a list of some autistic traits that overlap with the Gilmore parents: http://www.calgaryautism.com/characteristics.htm
