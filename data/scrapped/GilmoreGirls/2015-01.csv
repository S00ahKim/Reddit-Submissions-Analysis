That shows integrity. But...

I think Luke punching Christopher and purposefully hurting Lorelai when they ran into each other (twice) are not things Luke would do in the situation he was in. He would probably turn all the hurt to himself, maybe not talking to Lorelai for some time (which is justifiable) or even leaving Stars Hollow for a while, seeing as his diner was destroyed at the time also. There could be an interesting story here if they maybe tied it to what Dean told Luke two seasons ago: that he's not good enough for Lorelai, which is basically what Richard and Emily think as well and made sure he was aware.

At this point though, this just feels like a storyline every other, lesser show has ever done; missing the unique Gilmore Girls outlook on things. Season 6 had major problems finding storylines after Rory and Lorelai reunited (the Luke-Lorelai marriage storyline was awkward to say the least) but at least Luke wasn't happily beating on people and treating Lorelai like dirt. Because he wouldn't do that.

Since what's done is done, I have to at least hope that the show will harshly condemn Luke for that completely unacceptable behavior.",2,13,False,self,,,,,

and i heard that Alexis and Milo dated for 4 years? this was around the time after their break up i guess.

http://www.tvguide.com/news/milo-ventimiglia-qa-8457.aspx


Ausiello: Inquiring minds (read: TVGuide.com readers) must know: Are you single?

Milo: Yeah. 

Ausiello: How's single life treating you?

Milo: [ Chuckles] That's about all you'll get out of me. 

Ausiello: Any chance of you going back to Gilmore Girls?

Milo: Never gonna happen. 

Ausiello: Because the Palladinos are gone?

Milo: Yup. 

Ausiello: But what if the new show-runner, Dave Rosenthal, asks you? He might be a fan of yours.

Milo: I appreciate that, but I'm pretty busy this year. 

Ausiello: So you feel that Jess' story is done?

Milo: I felt that it was done a long time ago, but Dan and Amy kept saying, ""We got some cool things, and we're really hoping you'll be a part of it."" So I went back and I kind of enjoyed what Jess turned into. He turned into a grown-up. Watching [my] last episode, I was like, ""It's done."" 

Ausiello: Were you surprised that Amy and Dan left?

Milo: No. I think they thought that [Warner Bros.] was willing to take care of them like they take care of John Wells and Aaron Sorkin. Those guys have major empires. [Amy and Dan] had always been developing with the studio and trying to find some things to do, so the fact that they stepped away doesn't surprise me. Amy said she knows what happens in the last scene of the final episode, so who knows how that's going to turn out. But I'm not going to be part of it. It was always nice that they kept wanting me to come back. And I always had a good experience working with them. And, I have to admit, they gave me my first public push. All the work that I did [before Gilmore Girls] was very much under the radar, and still pretty much under the radar. 

Ausiello: Do you think next season will be the last?

Milo: I know Alexis' contract is up, and she really wants to leave. 

Ausiello: Lauren's contract will be up as well.

Milo: No, it's not. I think she bartered for more money one year to secure another [season]. 

Ausiello: Are you sure? I just talked to her, and she made it pretty clear that she was only contracted for one more season.

Milo: Eh, you probably know more than me. ",4,21,False,self,,,,,

I've been watching to see if other shows do this as much.

When a scene plays out in the show and characters take action, they often have another scene soon after where a character tells another character what happened. Usually it's Lorelai or Rory telling the other who wasn't present at the event. 

It makes sense sometimes. Like when Lorelai tells Luke about her and Rory's plan to go to Atlantic City for her 21st birthday and she lists all the little things they had wanted to do together. This conversation ends with, ""But I bet she doesn't remember that..."" 
Later in the episode, Rory relays this same plan with all the same details almost word for word; this is important/deliberate because it demonstrates (of course) that she DOES remember their plan. 

It seems other, more common, instances are just for the sake of filling time. When Logan brings Rory to a family dinner and they express how she's not a satisfactory addition to the family, we watch that whole evening play out. Later, Rory tells Lorelai what happened which makes sense because Lorelai wasn't there, BUT WE WERE.

STARS HOLLOW -- White lights twinkle in the trees around the bandstand. Ice cream is scooped at Taylor's Olde Fashioned Soda Shoppe. Coffee flows freely inside Luke's Diner.

Stars Hollow, home of The WB's ""Gilmore Girls,"" doesn't actually exist, of course, but it's easy to believe in the fictitious hamlet when wandering its streets (really the backlot at Warner Bros. in Burbank).

Magical as the setting is, the ""Girls"" have been in a funk this season. Characters have behaved out of character -- Lorelai (Lauren Graham) would never be interested in the cheeseball guy she's getting involved with -- and the transition to life as a college freshman for Rory (Alexis Bledel) -- is there ever a weekend she's not back home? -- was strained.

""Gilmore Girls"" creator Amy Sherman Palladino defends the show's recent storytelling, even the recent scene where Lorelai -- a single mother on a meager budget -- looked down her nose at people who clip coupons.

""When I was poor, I would never clip coupons,"" Sherman Palladino said, standing in front of Luke's wearing a Hello Kitty ring and necklace. ""I grew up with a mother with a coupon drawer and the clipping of coupons, and I said, 'You're nuts, you buy food you don't even want, you buy toothpaste that's disgusting, you buy four cans of peas and nobody eats peas.' To me, coupon clipping is a little nutty. [On 'Gilmore Girls'], you're talking about two women who do nothing but eat takeout; they don't even go to the supermarket.""

Sherman Palladino said she has mixed feelings about negative reactions to this season's episodes.

""I like that people are so invested in the characters that they even care, that there's a debate,"" she said. ""You couldn't have [Rory] live at home for a year because they'd both need mental counseling ...

""I personally liked what we did with their separation. I like the fact she kept going home for a while because I think in reality that's what would happen. Most kids, when they go to college, are like, 'Woo-hoo! Freedom! See you on laundry day!' But they didn't have that relationship with their parents that Rory has with Lorelai. It's very different leaving you very best friend, your biggest confidante. She doesn't view Lorelai as someone who's keeping her from freedom... I think Rory's always kind of felt like an adult. It's like leaving your best friend. It's a different transition and because of that, personally, I feel we were true to the nature of who they were.""

""Gilmore Girls"" has been in reruns or pre-empted since the end of November sweeps. A new episode airs next week. Upcoming episodes will feature the return of bad boy Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and the introduction of his mother. Dean (Jared Padelecki) will also be back.

Sherman Palladino hinted that Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) might get together someday, but she doesn't want to rush it.

""I think it's what we're all working toward, whether we do it before the end [of the series] or at the end,"" she said. ""It's one of the key touchstones of our show. You've got this woman working so hard to make it and her partner is right around the corner. If either one of them would just let the wall down for five seconds and keep the quips to a minimum and maybe say something real to each other, their lives would be very different.""
