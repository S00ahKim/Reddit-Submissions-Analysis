I dont know it just doesnt seem like a logical character progression for her.

Whats worse is that everyone seems basically ok with the new Rory and acts exactly as if she was the old Rory.

I dont know maybe its just that I really liked the fact that Rory represented a grounded moral compass for the earlier parts of the show, with just enough mistakes to make it believable or the fact that I think het casually cheating on Paul(who although not exactly her type was still her boyfriend and whom she at least could have had the decency to break-up with).

In general, it's safe to say Rory was a very moral and well-behaved teenage daughter but the few times that she thought Rory was hanging with a bad influence or making bad decisions, she reacts somewhat severely.

Now, let's compare that to stories that we hear about Lorelai as a child. She not only drank but she did things like stealing and breaking her parents alcohol, smoked, snuck out with boys before the age of 16. As a result, she also got pregnant at the age of 16. She wasn't just a quirky girl who rejected the stuffiness of old money, she was an poorly behaved child.

I 100% understand that when youre growing up you make tons of mistakes but personally I think if Rory hadnt met Logan lots of things couldve been avoided.

----

**It Should've Been Lorelai** - Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) are thrown for a loop when Christopher (David Sutcliffe) brings his new girlfriend Sherry (guest star Madchen Amick, ""Twin Peaks"") to Stars Hollow and she makes it clear that building a close relationship with Rory is her top priority. Meanwhile, when Emily (Kelly Bishop) learns about Sherry, she is furious with Lorelai for blowing her last chance of getting together with Christopher.

On the one hand, I wish Rory would have respected Lorelai's wishes and not told Emily, but on the other hand, without Emily, the situation wouldn't have been resolved. I also don't appreciate Lorelai's attitude that it isn't Rory's business. First, it directly affects her life and second, the dynamic Lorelai and Rory has is very open and honest and based on mutual respect. It irritates me that Lorelai shuts that down to avoid having to admit she's wrong. 

I feel for Lorelai in not wanting to tell her mom and being upset when Rory does. It's embarrassing to need help and there's so much bad blood between her and Emily. I completely get why she felt there would be strings attached, so the reluctance to have Emily involved is understandable. I imagine she was probably pretty frantic and scared as her opportunities for loans dwindled and that made her defensive. But I wish she would have been more appreciative towards her mom. The way Emily runs to her checkbook and offers to leave it blank so Lorelai can fill it in later gets me every time. It's generous, as is setting up the meeting and co-signing the loan, and Lorelai is extra ungrateful about it. 

And I wish Emily wouldn't have shown up in the meeting without telling Lorelai she would be there, and I really wish she would have been a whole different person while Lorelai was growing up so that this wouldn't be an issue. But I felt for her when Lorelai acted like such a jerk about that whole thing and I was glad when she apologized. 

Anyone else feel that way? I think it's really interesting that the episode is set up in a way that there are no ""good"" and ""bad"" gilmore girls, just a mix up of feelings and intentions. ",34,20,False,self,,,,,

LUKE: She picked you.

JESS: God knows why.

That line came across as something Luke would say about Lorelai.

Luke and Jess have a similar issue which is the emotional core of their characters - extreme insecurity &amp; fear of pain and vulnerability. It's why Jess didn't return Rory's calls and couldn't make the relationship work, why Luke took so long to admit his feelings for Lorelai and gets so affected by Christopher's ""we belong together"" speech in Wedding Bell Blues. 

So, the pivotal moment comes in 4x20 and 4x21 with Luke finally asking Lorelai out - and it goes wonderfully - and Jess tries to fix his relationship with Rory by asking her to run away with him - which ends disastrously - but the point of those scenes was about  both of them putting themselves in a vulnerable position, breaching the distance they'd build around those girls, knowing they could be hurt.",7,6,False,self,,,,,

**Dead Uncles and Vegetables** - Luke (Scott Patterson) is overwhelmed with funeral arrangements for his Uncle Louie, who was Stars Hollow's most disliked citizen, so Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) pitch in and work the counter at the diner, without much help from Jess (Milo Ventimiglia). Meanwhile, Emily's (Kelly Bishop) extravagant suggestions for Sookie's (Melissa McCarthy) upcoming wedding to Jackson (Jackson Douglas) cause everyone to freak out.

Revival Issue...: So many articles saying it is out of character, but it is NOT at all! The part in the revival where Rory and her mother are talking about a fat guy at the public pool.

There is an episode, specifically, in the original series, where Lorelai and Rory are watching a TV show called the Two Fat Ladies (literally it was the title of a real show lol), but Rory says ""Can't we find some other really fat people to watch?"". At another point, I remember when Lorelai was dreaming of being pregnant with twins that Rory says ""You are going to be so fat!"". There was a comment about how Richard takes things the wrong way and Lorelai says one time her dad wore a suit and wanted their opinion. Quote:

""And he wore it for us and he said, 'How do I look?' and I said, 'You look fat.""

More examples include when she bought ideas for her dad's birthday and one was a bathroom scale. Rory said it was a bad time to remind him that he had weight. Another time when the porch had termites Rory kept asking if her mom weighed a ton. They may have not done it very obviously, but they were always honest about how they felt about people and their looks, size, etc and obviously did not think fondly on the idea of being overweight... 

When Rory writes a review about a ballet, she comments on a fat roll the ballerina has and calls her a hippo... etc. Much more here in these articles I found because I can't remember them all, but it was not at all out of character, to me.

I just think it sends a bad message overall to younger girls/women who are watching the show and wonder ""Why can't I look like that when they eat crap all the time and look great?"" and who don't realize it's very unrealistic. 

I don't know. As someone who has seen people work very hard (including myself) to lose weight and stay healthy, it just irks me that ASP doesn't acknowledge the hard work that would realistically go into looking like Lorelai or Rory. Plus, all the fat shaming they do (even before the pool scene as others have pointed out) seems unfair because if they were real people with real metabolisms who actually ate like they depict on the show, they probably would be overweight, too.

Rory always had to bribe Dean to do things she wanted to do like she would watch battle bots with him if he would attend her coming out or that she would watch Lord of the Rings if he would attend the book fair with her.  He would sit there and pout while she was looking at books.  She also seemed frightened of him whenever he got mad and she felt so smothered by him. She looked so frightened when he threatened to kill Tristan and when he yells at her about Jess bring in her food.
  With Logan, she let him walk all over her.  He sleeps or makes out with Honor's wedding party and lets her walk right into that whole mess and she forgives him almost instantly. He gets drunk all the time because he's too immature to stand up to his dad and she is there to clean him up, get him home, and she stays with him despite the fact that he has a drinking problem and she deserves better than him.  We also see how she changes and becomes more like him. With Jess however, they both enjoy the same music and books and he doesn't expect her to change for him.  He lets her be who she is.  She even seems happier with him up until the contrived story line leading up to their break up so Jess could have his own spin off that never was.  When we see them sitting on the bridge talking in the bid a basket episode, she seems very comfortable and completely herself talking to him. Same when they are talking in the car in the Teach me tonight episode. She doesn't seem nervous at all.  Jess doesn't cheat on her or get drunk all the time, and doesn't have a bad temper.  She doesn't have to mold herself into someone she's not to be with him.  He's not perfect and he's not big on going to some of the events she wants to go but he owns who he is and lets her be her.  I have read different comments about Jess forcing himself on her at that party but I don't see it that way.  He was upset about repeating a grade knowing that means Luke will most likely abandon him too and he can't take Rory to the prom.  He goes to the party because she wants to go even though he is not a big party guy.  He goes up the bedroom to be alone when Rory comes up there and finds him.  They start kissing and I think in that moment Jess needs to feel loved and wanted so he tries to be more intimate with her by wanting to have sex with her.  The second she says no, he immediately backs off and doesn't try to sleep with her again.  He gets upset granted because he is feeling the sting of rejection/abandonment again but he doesn't yell at her or force himself on her.  He just seems really hurt and confused.  Rory runs out of the room crying although I'm not sure why she is so upset because he didn't force anything on her and stopped when she said she didn't want to go any further than kissing but as soon as Dean sees her crying, Dean flies off the handle thinking Jess did something and initiates a fight without knowing anything about the situation. Jess also knows her a lot better than her exes.  He shows that by talking to her about leaving Yale and he helps to get her back on track. He also calls her on her crap like when she came to see him to get back at Logan and make Logan jealous. He told Rory that he doesn't deserve to be treated like that and won't cheat with her to get back at some guy. He also called out her out for kissing him at Sookie's wedding and then expecting him to wait around her for while she is still with Dean.   ",35,0,False,self,,,,,

You can question things, be angry with things, etc -- but I see some people taking it WAY too far so my other question is: are you still continuing to enjoy it as *much* as you once did, or has your brain started to slowly make you hate the show/characters more than you've ever noticed?

Thankfully, I was able to ""re-train"" my brain in the past few weeks. I stepped away from any Gilmore Girls talk, and actually stopped watching the show. It was a Gilmore Girls mental break, if you will. I then began re-watching, and am happy to report that I fell back into my comfortable bubble, and it's awesome.

It's nice to have one thing in life not to think *too* hard about. I might not like a story-line, or even an action of a character and that's fine. I will not loathe them, or tear them down. I will still take part in discussions, and vent when/if I need to, but all in all I think this is the **one** thing I will look at in life with rose colored glasses forever. It's not that I'm ignorant and don't want to see the real picture, because I DO see it... but life is hard, stressful more often than not, and sometimes you just have to have ONE thing to rely on to make you happy and laugh always.

Which actor is your favorite? Which project is your favorite? 

Matt Czuchry had a long running part in The Good Wife and is currently set to star in a new Fox series ""The Resident."" which I for one am excited about. 

Melissa McCarthy had a very successful movie career and a long running series that did well. 

Lauren Graham had a few movies and the hugely successful run in Parenthood. She now voices the mom in Vampirina. 

Alexis Bledel is now an Emmy winning actress for her work in Handmaiden's Tale. 

Milo Ventimiglia is a fan-fave in This is Us. 

Jared Padelecki has maintained a lead role on Supernatural, a show that is still hugely successful on its network and has been running for 13 seasons. 

Liza Weil is apart of How to Get Away with Murder. 


So, who do you love in their role in GG and who do you love as an actor outside of GG? 

For me: I love Melissa McCarthy, Lauren Graham, and Matt Czuchry as actors. I think they excel in every part they take on and make me love their characters every time. 

I love Supernatural and Jared's character, but I haven't seen him in anything else, so I can't attest to his abilities. I also loved Parenthood with all my heart.

**Back in the Saddle Again** - When her school holds its annual Business Fair, Rory (Alexis Bledel) must create and market a first-aid kit for teenagers, so she turns to her newly retired grandfather Richard (Edward Herrmann), who is so thrilled to have a business project to work on that he decides to end his retirement and start a second career. Meanwhile, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) causes problems for Michel (Yanic Truesdale) when his flamboyant mother (guest star Janet Hubert) visits town, and Dean (Jared Padalecki) is miserable when he suspects that Rory is losing interest in him.

It's completely OOC for Lorelai to put so much weight on Rory's virginity. 

**ETA: I'm not talking about Lorelai's response to HOW Rory lost her virginity. Being upset someone you're close to is having an affair with a married guy is beyond normal. I'm talking about the comments she makes about Rory's virginity. Saying ""I've got the good kid"" when she overhears Paris talking about having sex with Jamie. The ""you've gotta tell mommy what happened in Kyle's bedroom!"" and the ""please tell me before you do"" and her obvious discomfort and strange panicky sadness every time Rory talks about it, which doesn't happen until Rory is 18 anyway.** 

You always worry about your kid, and having sex is a big deal, so I can understand why she would want to instill in Rory that it's a serious thing. I also don't think anyone is ever like ""YAY! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY!"" when they find out their kid is having sex, but Lorelai seems to place some of Rory's value in remaining a virgin.  I know she got pregnant young, but Lorelai is a realist, so I think that would (and did) manifest in educating Rory about BC. 

ASP is a feminist, so that also makes no sense. I think she said she didn't want teenagers to be having sex - which is anti-reality, judgmental, and idiotic considering Rory lost her virginity as a teen- but even if that were the case, there's no reason for Lorelai to be so concerned with Rory staying a virgin, and then once she is no longer a virgin, becoming obsessed with and critical of Rory's sexual habits. 

It doesn't even really add ""drama"" to the show. I cannot figure out why this was a thing.

The thing is every time I read interviews where Amy and Dan talk about the revival I have the impression that they are a lot more open minded than most of their fans. 

When everybody thinks Rory sucks as a journalist, Amy goes and says that they didnt want to write her as a failure but to reflect that she chose a profession that is very challenging at the moment (Im a 43 years old European journalist, working for one of the Cond Nast magazines in Spain, actually, and shes absolutely right. We are in a sinking ship, nobody knows whats going to happen in 10/20 years). They apparently love journalism and they are devastated about whats happening. In the revival they wanted to talk about that and also to show that Rory is lost and in denial about her situation. 

When everybody assumes Rory is the worst for cheating on Paul with an engaged man, they say (I read it in an interview) that sometimes when you are in a bad place in your life you do things that later you will regret. But that doesnt make you a bad person. Of course I dont support infidelity, but sometimes it happens and that doesnt mean you are a horrible, selfish person. Life is just difficult and messy. Feelings are complex.  

When they ask them about Emily, Amy says that she loves her and she understands her because she has never been able to overcome her daughter abandoning her.

So the way I see it the Palladinos made this loveable flaw characters going through life the best they can, trying to be happy. And the more the story evolves and the more they put themselves into it (the Palladinos), the more people hate the story. Specially the revival, thats more complex, messy, fatalistic in a way and heartbreaking. But good writing has always many layers and can be interpreted in different ways. Thats why we are still talking about this one year (15 years) later. Thats what make the whole thing more interesting, not only entertainment. Didnt Amy said that also? That the series was weekly entertainment but with the revival they wanted to tell more? I guess most people just wanted conforting entertainment, which is completely respectable and understandable.

She doesn't force Rory to do things her way the way the Gilmores did to Lorelai, but she's just as manipulative.

Since Rory was 3, Lorelai has pushed her to go to Harvard (and it's mentioned that when Lorelai was a child, she really wanted to go to Yale). For a woman who chose to live the lower middle-class life, shunning her own upbringing, shooting for an ivy league isn't (or shouldn't be) realistic. And then when she freaks out at Thanksgiving over Rory applying to other universities and (gasp!) Yale, it shows that she is not okay with Rory diverging from the path ""they"" chose ""together.""

Whenever Rory starts to date a new guy, Lorelai freaks out a little. They all seem to need her stamp of approval before she'll even be okay with Rory considering them. And let's not forget the whole Dean/cheating debacle. This was an action/choice Rory made. Heck, Lorelai was a teenage mother, and she decided to throw morality at that same kid?

When Rory went through her issues with Mitchum and dropped out of Yale for a semester, Lorelai didn't try to help Rory deal with her feelings. Either Rory went back to school, or she moved out and wouldn't be allowed to talk to her.

Lorelai is a great casual acquaintance and friend, but she honestly thinks she knows better than everyone else and is very judgmental. With Rory, she wanted a friend (and if you look at some of their interactions like when Lorelai breaks her engagement with Max and goes to Sherry's baby shower, she raised Rory to have the kind of personality she wishes her mother had).

----

**Help Wanted** - While Lorelai (Lauren Graham) volunteers her organizational skills to help her father Richard (Edward Herrmann) set up his consulting business, Rory (Alexis Bledel) slowly realizes that everyone in Stars Hollow blames Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) for the accident that led to her broken wrist, and her anger and guilt finally erupt in an outburst directed at her grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). Meanwhile, Lane (Keiko Agena) discovers a new dream of becoming a rock drummer when a former New Yorker named Sophie (guest star Carole King, record-breaking ""Tapestry"" album) opens the town's first music store.

1) Rory as a new mother. I could see Rory struggling a bit and not getting the hang of patenting right away, causing some interesting and relatable conflict for her and maybe between her and super mom Lorelai. 

2) The Gilmore Girls book comes out and becomes popular. Hollywood takes notice and wants to turn it into a show, with Rory and Doyle adapting it. I see it becoming a hilarious bizarro version of GG. Bonus Paris scenes, of course.

3) Luke has a bit of a mid-life crisis and wants to try something knew. Maybe he goes back to school, gets politically active, I don't know, but I want him to have a story were he is the ""doer"" and Lorelai is trying to be the ""supporter"". 

4) Hep Alien gets some underground fame and the band try to deal with the newfound notice their band is getting, after assuming the would just be music hobbyists for the rest of their lives. Hilarity ensues.

I've come to the realization that I would never want to date either of them. They seem to have a lack the understanding of how healthy relationships should look. None of the girls' suitors were great either but I'm addressing Lorelai and Rory's behaviors within those relationships.

Rory and Dean: She becomes invested in Jess and treats Dean awful. She chooses to go with Jess instead of Dean at the bid-a-basket even though she knew it was hurt Dean. She goes to NY to see Jess and then kisses him when he comes back to Stars Hollow all while dating Dean. She clearly isn't invested in Dean any longer and appears to want to be with Jess but continues to drag Dean along. She sleeps with Dean twice even though he is married and instead of dealing with it, she went off to Europe with Emily. 

Rory and Logan: She is jealous of Bobby even though she expects Logan to be comfortable with her hanging out with Jess or Marty. She reacts poorly to most fights her and Logan have. For example, instead of trying to dicuss the bridesmaid scenario, she up and moved out. She froze Logan out and went to Stars Hollow for days without telling him or answering his calls. She freezes him out when he goes to Vegas after he made the business deal. She kisses Jess while dating Logan.

Lorelai and Max: She called Chris during her Bachelorette party because she was unsure of her feelings for Max. She left him the week of their wedding. Then after all that kissed him after she broke his heart.

Lorelai and Chris: She kisses Chris and sleeps with him all while he had a girlfriend. She sleeps with Chris right after breaking off her engagement to Luke. She marries him on a whim while she clearly still has feelings for Luke. Again, refuses to move and appears  unwilling to be flexible.

Lorelai and Alex: She kisses Max while dating Alex.

Lorelai and Jason: She is jealous and treats Jason harshly when she discovers he brought a date to a function even though she refuses to tell her parents they are dating which leaves Jason with no choice but to bring a date. 

Lorelai and Luke: Before they were even dating she became jealous of women who appeared interested in Luke including the women he dated even though she felt it was acceptable for her to date other people. Once they were together, she hid the fact that she drank with Chris even though she knew he would disapprove and then blindsided him at her parents' vow renewal only because she was afraid Chris would say something. She sleeps with Chris the same night she broke off her engagement. She didn't seem to understand Luke's need for time after April came into his life. She went to Anna after Luke had asked her no too. Lastly, she once again refuses to move and insists on living at her house.

All in all, I'd say the girls hold their men to high standards but often hide things, cheat or help someone cheat and lash out when things don't go their way. 

EDIT: I'm open to hearing other people's thoughts but I'm hoping the conversation can remain civil. This is a pretty controversial topic in this sub, especially with so many people being unwavering Rory and Lorelai fans.",16,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

LORELAI: Get out of here.

EMILY: I will not get out of here.

LORELAI: No Mom, I didn't mean really get out of here.

RORY: Why is Grandpa in Akron?

LORELAI: I mean...

EMILY: I don't know.

LORELAI: It was just a saying.

EMILY: They sent him to deal with some problem with their local office down there.

LORELAI: A saying, you know, like 'save me' or 'get me out of here'. Things like that.

EMILY: Lorelai, would you like me to put a mirror in front of you so you can look at yourself while you have this conversation? 


It's tolerable when it's brief and at least somewhat relevant to the conversation, but there's another scene where Madeline goes on and on about how her mother can't make soup for NO REASON while Rory, Dean, and Louise completely ignore her.

It has always irritated me that Mia gets painted as Lorelai and Rory's savior. She gave Lorelai a job as a maid. Is that really all that..shocking? I mean, I get that Lorelai had no work experience or references, but plenty of people get jobs at 16 without either of those things. Still, I can buy that that was unlikely and a kind thing to do. 

What I can't get into is this idea that she is somehow a saint for allowing Lorelai and her infant daughter to live in a TOOL SHED on the back of her property. Nothing about that is nice or cute or sweet or romantic. Sending an infant or a toddler to an uninsulated shack in the middle of Connecticut winter is.. gross. There's really no other word for it. It's not like she let them stay at the Inn. It's not costing her money, harming her in anyway, or even being a general inconvenience, to allow them to sit in a shed. 

Now, here's what I'm NOT trying to argue: That Mia *owed* them something more. (though I think just being a generally-okay human would indicate that one shouldn't knowing let an infant and her teen mother be homeless- a tool shed qualifies as homeless) I get that she didn't know them and it wasn't her problem, so how some other people would have handled it may have been different. I know she was good and kind to them and I don't mean to discredit that. It's the way she's painted, as though she changed Lorelai's whole life that bothers me. Lorelai did that. 

What I AM saying is: Why is she so idolized? What exactly did she do for R/L other than give Lorelai a job? I get that at that job, Rory got to hang, which is nice, but we're also under the impression that the entirety of the town helped out with Rory. Is it more what Mia symbolizes?

Without any context for his breakup with Rory! I don't even LIKE Dean, but I can't believe that she would treat a high school sophomore that way. And she's often even worse towards Jess. Yes, she had a legitimate reason not to like him, but she definitely crossed the line at times. Openly mocking him for having feelings for Rory while she was still with Dean (Lost and Found) was cruel and unnecessary, she tried to confront him about the accident without even knowing whether or not he was okay (Teach Me Tonight), and she rubbed Rory moving on after their break up in his face (Nag Hammadi Is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels). Even the way that she talked about him to other characters felt really inappropriate, like when she told Luke that everyone hated him and that he should prioritize her family over his. She literally yelled ""I win!"" after he left Stars Hollow, and every time I watch that scene I think yeah, congrats, you bested a 17 year old, you should be so proud...

She was a parent in her 30s and she should have recognized that there was a more appropriate way to handle it when she had an issue with their behavior. I'm definitely not saying she needed to like them or even be nice, but it felt like she crossed the line occasionally. Idk, am I overreacting? I just know that I wouldn't be comfortable with someone talking to or about my younger siblings like that (and Lorelai wouldn't be either, since she tells Lindsay's mom that attacking Rory, who's almost 20 and slept with her daughter's husband, was inappropriate in A Messenger, Nothing More).

**Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days** - Returning from her summer internship in Washington, D.C., where she mingled with members of Congress, including Senator Barbara Boxer (guest-starring as herself), Rory (Alexis Bledel) faces a dilemma in her conflict over Dean (Jared Padalecki) and Jess (Milo Ventimiglia). Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is overjoyed to have Rory home, but the news that Christopher's (David Sutcliffe) girlfriend is having a baby leaves Lorelai questioning her future.

According to Scott, ""I gotta be honest with you, I didnt like it. I understand why it was there. It was such an awkward situation for me as a character, Patterson, 59, exclusively tells Us Weekly. They were thinking a lot of humor could come out of this and it did. I just think it was a little too far field for me personally. He also said ""In my mind its just a foregone conclusion that we are going to have a child but not like that, he continues. Those were tough days for me on set. I didnt settle into that part of the story very well. I know that guy very well and I know how he feels. Just the fact that he hung around for so long and the way he feels the way he does about her. I mean, of course he wants to have a child with her.

Patterson shared his opinion on set, but didnt really talk about it with Graham, 50. Nevertheless, he trusted in the creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino and what they wrote. I didnt like it. I just did not and I let that be known, he says. I love and adore the writing and I love and adore both of them. I just did have an issue with that. Not that it mattered and I absolutely get why they did it and I think it provided some really, really fresh humor. But I would have been happier without it.  I just remember being in conversation a little bit and being a little concerned about it.

But listen, thats the thing about the writing  when you think theyre going to go big they go small and vice versa, he adds. Its like how they handled the wedding. You didnt really see it, did you? That was the big thing and thats what the fans wanted for all those years. They just wanted a wedding and they got this charming little thing at the end in the gazebo with snow coming down on her with me nowhere to be seen. It wasnt what you expect but thats really the beauty of the writing and the beauty of the show. Its always what you dont expect and that keeps people on their toes.

He also said he if he was asked to come back for more GG shows he is 75% sure he would say yes but the other 25% of him would need to read the script first.

A lot of my feelings stemmed from having big hopes and dreams for her character and not seeing those play out in the revival. While I realize that this may be an accurate portrayal, as someone close to her age, I had hoped to hear of a success story. 

I know a small amount of her difficulties can be attributed to the Recession, which hit just as the show was going off the air. Some of it might be attributable to the death of print. But a lot of it seems to be in her attitude toward things. 

Now I am doing a re-watch of the original series and I am realizing that if I didn't like her so much as a character I might have predicted this from past behavior. Things I've noticed that may have put poor Rory on the wrong path:
-sleeping with her married ex (Dean)
-suffering few (if any) repercussions for this decision (yes, there is an awkward scene in the town square/ with Luke/ with Dean's mom) but the rest of the time people seem to tacitly accept them as a  couple. If I remember correctly, Rory seems to suggest Lindsey was a good person and also grew up there her whole life. Where is the rage for poor Lindsey (as misguided as her decisions may be)?
-Her whole hijacking a boat because my feelings got hurt by Mitchum situation. What is up with that? She spends her whole life crying over library fines and now she's hooking up with married guys and stealing boats? She clearly has not had enough experience with rejection up to this point. 
-The way that everyone assumes it was Logan's bad influence that caused her to make said insane decision
-The way she's celebrated by Logan's group for making said bad decision


-Also, one final thought:
Does it bother anyone that she assumed she would get the Reston Fellowship despite having a criminal record? I am sure many people apply for this Fellowship who have a clean criminal history. I was not at all surprised in the series when she didn't get it. Her lack of enthusiasm for other positions also may have been a bit predictive of her future. 

I am hoping she learns from her Mama and seizes on some of that motivation we saw at the end of AYITL to turn things around. Sad we won't see it play out on another season of AYITL.",41,31,False,spoiler,,,,,

Even rewatched all of it when the original season was available on Netflix.  In the Revival Season, I noticed a few problematic scenes but let them slide. 

When I started watching The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, I realized the problem must be a fault of ASP. 

Both Gilmore Girls and TMMM have lead roles of beautiful white skinny women (yes, Midge is Jewish but privileged)

In TMMM, Midge is obsessed with her measurements, talks awfully about her daughter's forehead, and even laughed at her husband's jokes about Susie. 

Also, when Shonda Rhimes calls out ""Bunheads"" lack of diversity ASP decided to say that Rhimes wasn't supporting her by calling her out instead of addressing the true issue. 

Am I the only one who feels this way?
