Made me super sad for her, and to be honest, kind of annoyed with Rory. Like, she's always telling Dean/Jess that they could do more and go to college and study hard. Why didn't she ever say something similar to Lane? Lane is just as smart as Rory, but I feel like Mrs Kim holds her back from achieving anything significant in her life. 

I think it's patently ridiculous that Mrs Kim didn't want to send Lane to a decent college (not Ivy League, necessarily, but there are plenty of good colleges/universities out there that aren't as restrictive as that horrid Seventh Day Adventist college she sent Lane to). The college Lane went to seemed to teach no actual life skills (based on the little we saw/heard about it), the people there seemed extraordinarily close-minded (remember that study group she was a part of?) and now I'm just wondering what exactly Mrs Kim wanted for Lane's life. 

Like didn't she want her daughter to get a good job, earn some money, and be an independent adult? Lane could've still been a mature, responsible adult who married a respectable Korean dude if she'd gone to a more academic, less intensely religious college. 

When Lane stays at Yale with Rory and says ""Look at what you've got; you have a life. I have no life."" it made me feel so awful for her. 
Just think about how far Lane could've gone if she'd gone to a decent, academic college (or perhaps Julliard or someplace with a good music program - forgive me, I'm not American so my knowledge of American colleges is limited). She could've gone out, gotten a good job, earned some money, moved away from Stars Hollow, taken some time to figure herself out, made some new friends and some great memories. 

Instead, she stays stuck in Stars Hollow under Mrs Kim's oppressive regime, at least until Lane moves out and does her own thing. But even then, she had to do it all herself. Think how much further she could've gone if she'd had Mrs Kim's support. 

I'm all for wanting to protect your kids from the world, but... Mrs Kim did not do right by her daughter, and it makes me sad for Lane. Thank you for reading my rant.",56,171,False,self,,,,,

So I watched a bunch of other shows.

I started with **Parks and Rec**, and don't get me wrong - I loved it. I thought it was funny and very enjoyable (minus the last 2-3 seasons). But dear god was it loud sometimes. I'm talking *random obnoxious loudness*. Whenever a character goes to a bar, or goes to dancing, or someone plays music, or anything resembling the need for music...it's like the volume on TV goes ALL THE WAY UP. And it totally annoyed me.

I love watching things in the background sometimes. Granted, that's totally possible with Gilmore Girls because I pretty much have it memorized.

But when I decided to rewatch it again 2 days ago, and watched about 5 episodes in one sitting, I felt so..incredibly...**calm**. It's *amazing*. It felt like it was soothing me. And for so long I thought it's because I'm biased and have been in love with this show for so long. But really, I think it's because of the music.

Gilmore Girls is so quiet, even when it's loud. Even when Lorelai and Emily are at each others' throats, yelling at each other, or whatever other ""loud"" thing happens throughout the show's seven season run, it never feels the need to force-stimulate our emotions by throwing obnoxiously loud music.

I've watched Gilmore Girls a billion times and it's amazing how my perception of every character hsa changed as I've grown up. 

I'm rewatching &amp; just REALLY needed somewhere to vent cause I'm on Season 6.

Rory is one of the worst characters. I like her a lot in 1,2,3 &amp; even some of 4! 

But I can't get over her temper tantrum over Mitchum Huntzberger saying she isn't good enough (btw I thought he said it REALLY nicely and was completely correct in his assessment at the time also in AYITL it turned out he was correct..?) and then wont talk to Lorelei, goes to her Grandparents but what KILLS ME

Is that she punishes her grandparents when they have done EVERYTHING for her.

They were amazing. Guess what, if you're 21 &amp; lost &amp; want to live at home &amp; not handle being an adult yet - that's fine! But You have to respect the rules of the home that is taking care of you when you are an ADULT.

I know Emily isn't amazing, but it just wrecks me as I get older (i'm 23) &amp; she's so mean to them &amp; critical &amp; i really think they did their best. &amp; when they realized she shouldn't be with them they fought Mitchum Huntzberger &amp; were figuring out how to get her on the right path and it just destroys me how abusive she is to them.

4-1
- i actually didnt take notes on this episode but from what i remember she liked it, she thought it was funny how kirk was a skydiver and she thought all the ice cream queen stuff was funny
- we also were wondering about why the girls liked biscotti so much because its just hard bread with no flavor. for girls that like sugar so much wouldnt they dip it into something??? idk one of our random thoughts

4-2
- she didnt like how they tried making Nicole a villain just because she broke up with him. especially when they had all those lawyers coming to lukes on her behalf (im sure she will feel differently on nicole in 4.17 but we arent there yet haha)
- she thought it was funny how paris had a life coach
- she felt bad for luke because lorelai kept taking his truck
- also that moment where lorelai walks into an empty house at the end is SO GOOD and she really enjoyed that. it made her emotional 

4-3
- we skipped this one but i summarized it pretty good i think. its one of the episodes i skip because i think its boring idk but i wanted to get to 404

4-4
- i said that taylor was being annoying and shes like oh i know i work with people like this
 my mom thinks its odd that dean got married at 18, - but i have a cousin who got married at 18 so shes like i cant really judge
- she was also like lorelais teeth are different the entire episode (she was actually right ive seen the show over 6 times and ive never noticed it. in her words i notice this stuff, im like a hawk. i notice if the shirt color is different in the same scene. they cant fool me)

4-5
- my mom thought it was weird that emily had a ponytail in her words ohhhh no i dont like that (her mom wears her hair in the same style as emily so it would be like if she wore a ponytail that would be weird)
- she does not like the name davey 
- she really thought when lorelai invited luke over they were gonna get together 
- also why does she say casablanca like casaBLANKa....i dont UNDERSTAND 
- my mom was laughing on how the guy sat at the same side of the table, and started giving me dating advice 
- she stopped giving me advice though as soon as luke and lorelai came on screen shes so hopeful that they are getting together this episode 
- rory: he looks comfy here doesnt he
lorelai: yeah he does
my mom: mhmmmmmm 
- overall she thought 405 was boring (its one of my favorite episodes though haha)
- she also was like oooooo rejected when they boy rejected rory

thats all from us today!! also a few fun things (gilmore related of course) 1. i convinced her to get us tickets to go to the warner brothers gilmore event in december and im SO EXCITED. we are going on the first day and i will definitely do a review of our thoughts (i just hope we get far enough in the series where nothing major is spoiled for her there) 2. there was gilmore trivia on HQ trivia tonight and i won (this is not significant at all i just felt like bragging haha). thanks for tuning in and we will see you in a few weeks!",4,15,False,self,,,,,

Lorelai kept Max away from her life. Not just her life with Rory, but her Stars Hallows Life. He wasnt her best friend for partner for all intents and purposes.

Their first break up was incredibly confusing. Max was indignant at first and the moment he found out their was the possibility of even being frowned at he abandons the woman hes been pursuing for the past few months... wtf ?

Their reconciliation while standard and predictable, was lacking. There was no conversation about how to fix the problem. There wasnt even an acknowledgement of the fact that they were just going to be okay with their dating being a point of contention for Maxs employment although thats exactly what followed suit. 

The viewer is then shown possibly the worst display of a romantic gesture that ASP could have possibly drawn up where Max proposes during an argument. How in the world would this ever have worked out????? In what universe do you fix a relationship by marrying the woman you are have an unstable relationship with? 

Then the real proposal I believe that it is very symbolic that the proposal is done over the phone. This act highlights the divide between Max and Lorelai. Of course they had chemistry Max is beautiful with words and Lorelai is in desperate need of a storybook romance but nothing about the relationship was practical or realistic.

Quite frankly, it had the power to turn the most secure of men insecure. Lets run down the scenarios and see why this moment was all kinds of wrong and Luke couldnt win no matter what he did:



1. If he gifted her nothing, he wouldve looked like an asshole sitting there and then there would be the unspoken consensus that he shouldve gotten her something. And everyone would secretly be waiting for a moment that would never come. (Is he going to give her something now? How about now? Its almost dinnertime. Maybe now? Oh, youre going to sleep?) Torture.



2. If he gifted her something he could afford, Lorelai wouldve loved it. Logan wouldve been nice about it. But Luke wouldve acted out. Hed make an off-handed comment about the rich the way Marty did about Logan. Hed make it awkward and continue to dish out his insecurity for the rest of the day.




3. And then theres, of course, the moment we got. When Luke whipped it out like, hey, its my turn! even he wasnt convinced it was something he could afford or choose. Lorelai was in awe, but you could tell the girls were thinking how the hell can he afford that. That almost matching comment made it worse although Rory didnt mean it. The way Luke pathetically went on with the lie, yup, same shop! Simply awful.




Suffice it to say, the second-hand embarrassment I get just watching it unfold, a tv show has no business being this painful.

Then she starts making really bad decisions. For me some of the worst are quitting Yale, sleeping with Dean, stealing the Yacht, and ignoring Lorelei not once, but twice.

I always figured this was just bad writing. I mean c'mon the Rory we know from earlier seasons wouldn't act like this.

After watching the revival though, I think Rory was always doomed to repeat a lot of Lorelei's mistakes (and make some new ones). The show starts with a single mom who wishes to do better for her daughter; and the show ends with Rory presumably in a similar (albeit much earlier) stage.

Would be interesting to see where Rory went beyond that. I always imagine that Logan is the father but that she'll raise the child on her own or with Jess.

April lived the first 12 years of her life without a father in her life. We never hear about any grandfather or uncles either, so it's assumed that she had no father figure at all.

At some point in her 12 years of life, April must have realized that most kids have both a mother and a father, if not directly involved in their lives, then at least who are aware of their existence. She must have realized that in small-town Connecticut, having no father and having no clue who he is was not typical. She must have asked the questions ""Where is my father?"" ""Why don't I have a father?"" or ""Who is my father?"" 

How did Anna respond to these questions? 

Clearly, Anna personally knew that Luke was April's father, but never told this to April. It must have bothered April, because she researched the identities of her mother's ex-boyfriends of around 13 years prior, found where they lived/worked, and traveled to them to obtain a DNA sample. Not an easy task for a 12 year old, no matter how brilliant! This isn't behavior you'd see from a kid who is indifferent about having a father in her life.

Now that I've realized this, it really bothers me to think of little April through the years, wondering about her father while her mother withheld this information from her. :(",11,1,False,self,,,,,

\*When discussing the family mausoleum, Emily asks what family member should be moved to the annex (to Rorys horror)\*  
Lorelai: Why dont we move Aunt Cecile? She was always so annoying at parties. She loved the knock-knock jokes.

Rory: Mom!

Lorelai: What?

Rory: You cant just kick out Aunt Cecile.

Lorelai: Knock-knock. Whos there? Pineapple. Pineapple who? Thats where it ended. Never fully grasped the knock-knock concept.

I dont want this to come across in a negative way, but Scott has been pretty involved with all of the GG stuff lately: doing GG marathon second year in a row, showing up at the WB lot and GG festival, coming up with his own coffee ( which I find to be pretty clever business move). 

And although I think its pretty cool and I wish some of the main actors would do the same, I cant stop thinking its more because he doesnt have much going on acting work wise and he is trying to relive his old glory days than him really caring about his fans that much all of the sudden.. Which dont get me wrong, its perfectly okay. Its just that his hard core involvement with it seem all of the sudden. I know that some of the supporting cast have been coming to GG festivals and stuff. 
Not sure how to describe it but for instance Emily, Chris, Lane etc.. arent too busy acting wise at the moment and still dont really engage with any GG related stuff. I know Alexis, Lauren, Milo, Matt, Lisa etc have other shows at the moment.

Watching the series growing up, Rory's studious nature, ambitions, and academic success was always such an inspiration for me when I was a young girl. It seemed like she was smart and hard-working enough to achieve everything she set her mind to - from getting into, and then getting through Chilton and becoming valedictorian, getting into Harvard and Yale, becoming the editor of the Yale Daily News, etc.

When the whole Mitchum-debacle happened it was the first taste of failure that Rory had ever had, and when I watched it as a kid I found it really out of character and depressing - because her characteristics had always been something to aspire to, and it was so very out of character and not fitting for who she was. She later bounced back with that whole job on Obama's campaign bus so everything solved itself, like it always did in her life. 

Then I watched the revival so many years later, and Rory was just completely different from her OG self. And while it initially was so weird to watch and I'd find her really annoying and fundamentally un-Rory like in a lot of scenes, I really enjoyed watching the realistic aspect of her career failure. After everything she achieved in her life, journalism just ended up not being one of them - which is the one thing she wanted more than anything. 

I LOVED that. Because that's exactly what real life is - unpredictable. Sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out in the end. Sometimes you try your hardest to accomplish a creative dream and it *still* fails. And it's so rare to see that portrayed, especially in someone like Rory, who everyone on the show considers ""Most Likely to Succeed"". I really like that we get to see that career paths aren't linear, and sometimes your initial dreams don't work out, no matter how much you and everyone else thought they would. And so you find something else, something similar, that fulfills you in the same way. 

While there was a lot of things I didn't like about the revival, I just really enjoyed that realism. Anyone else feel that way?",18,1,False,self,,,,,

He seems like the good guy to Logan and Rory, but he is just as scheming as the rest of the family, he is just more subtle about it. Also, Lorelei was dead on about the internship being a bad idea.

She was always the 'good kid' in eyes of Lorelai, 'a fine young woman' for Emily and Richard and the 'sweet kid' for the people of Stars Hollow. In the show, no one practically hated her. Everyone, even Paris, showered her with so much admiration, Rory herself never realizes that she is flawed just like everybody else. The only hate I saw was Lindsay because obviously. Until Mitchum came along and changed that for her. That level of criticism seems so first time for Rory that she turns it into an entire whole story of Mitchum manipulation. She, in her head can never ever see her own shortcomings because no one ever told her of it.

Also, I also feel that Rory never had any real passion for journalism, it was more like a childhood thing that Lorelai again validated and it sort of went with the perfect Rory image that Rory had of herself in her head. Yes, I agree she did read a lot, but a lot of reading is not a sure shot translator of a career either in writing or journalism. I also read a lot but I work in the Information Technology sector which is pretty technical. Reading is more like an escape; you do it because the real world is never as stable as it is in books. And considering Rory's circumstances, she sought to reading as an escape from the turmoil of Lorelai's unstable love life and all that came with Lorelai being a single mother.

It made a lot of sense for her to be in the AYITL the way she was. She never realized what a shitty thing cheating is so she did it anyway.  No one ever told her how she lacked grit, so she never developed it.

I made sure not to google anything or come on here beforehand so I knew nothing. There was a lot about it I liked and a lot about it I didnt and most of that had to do with Rory, she is such a self-centered, entitled person. 

I cannot get over how she denied Logans proposal but went on to cheat with him whilst hes engaged and then become pregnant with his child, we all know she proceeded to tell him and he broke off his engagement, not that she shouldnt tell him, but she shouldnt be pregnant with his child when hes engaged to begin with. Her cheating again showed that she had no remorse for ruining Deans marriage to Lindsay. She treated all of her boyfriends like trash, especially poor Paul, she didnt deserve him. She lead Marty on forever, all the while knowing that he had feelings for her. In the end he became a creep, sure, but he was humiliated by her rejection and went about it the wrong way. She was also a crappy friend to Paris, swiping the editor position right from under her, always talking behind her back and denying that they were close friends when in fact they were extremely close, so much so that they lived together. 

I couldnt stand how she constantly played the victim and continued to be praised by all of Stars Hollow no matter what she did. What was surprisingly refreshing about the revival is that it felt like she was finally held accountable for what she was doing and she didnt get everything she wanted, she got nothing she wanted. Her and Christopher tie for my most despised characters on the show.

I can definitely see an argument for it, particularly with regards to Rory's lack of desire to lead and her generally passive, people-pleasing personality. There are also times, though, when I've seen her act very much like Lorelai in the later seasons (or maybe I'm just thinking of all the party planning that each of the three Gilmore Girls does throughout the series and how similar they seem in those instances).

In the first season, Mia claims that Rory was a tiny baby when Lorelai arrived at the Independence Inn, but during a flashback in Dear Emily and Richard, Emily states that shed been tripping over Rorys stroller for a year - implying that Lorelai and Rory lived in the Gilmore house that whole time. Assuming that Rory was several months to a year old when she and Lorelai moved to Stars Hollow, what do you think life was like before then? Characters sometimes 
talk about the times before and while Lorelai was pregnant and the time she arrived in Stars Hollow; yet those several months to a year that Lorelai and Rory lived with Emily and Richard are never referenced, apart from the flashback that takes place right after Lorelai and Rory left. 

I think that it wouldve definitely been tense, because Emily and Richard were disappointed and embarrassed, and Lorelai resented them for their feelings and attempts to control her. However, they all mightve also bonded over raising Rory. Emily and Lorelai would definitely clash over their different parenting styles, though they mightve also occasionally agreed on some things - which would simultaneously relieve and terrify Lorelai. I could also imagine Richard feeling somewhat fascinated by baby Rory, because he likely wasnt around much while Lorelai was growing up, and would be amazed to see how quickly Rory learned things.

She tells Lorelei Maybe if Id sent him to Luke a little sooner. like shes saying oh you know I did all the right things for him but it didnt turned out in a way I wanted and the only reason I failed him is because I didnt ask my brother to parent him sooner.

But the S5 finale though, feels more cut and dry. The major conflict - Mitchum making Rory doubt herself and her deciding to drop out of Yale - seem to almost come out of nowhere. We dont really see her struggling with the Yale Daily News (and the one time we do with the music downloading story, its solved fairly quickly) and the overall season arc for Rory in S5 seemed to focus more on Rory putting herself out there and experiencing new things rather than whether or not shes capable of being a journalist.

claims Mother is allergic to Lulu so must keep them separate 
Lulu is exceptionally understanding of knowledgeable about imaginatory sorts
performance piece where he and Mother are one
difficulty recognizing Jackson while selling the basket
outright went by a different name at least once
fantasy film where dog narrowly escapes getting hit by car. in reality, maybe based off when Norman Bates stuffed that dog to keep him around. became a dogwalker of epic proportions

claimed to have loads of siblings, yet we never saw even one. claimed Mother made a basket for everyone but him. perhaps they were all him including Mother

I agree that she was a good girl in the begging of the show but as the show goes on, I started to think shes self centered and condescending.


She tends be occupied with her own stuff and ignores Lane even when shes being super excited to talk about her love life or when she needs to talk about her issues. 

She keeps being in a relationship with Dean while she grows her feelings for Jess. 
After she gets together with Jess, she doesnt believe what Jess says and goes to Dean to make sure if they really didnt get into a fight. (despite the fact she always complains everyone always thinks Jess is the bad guy.)
Then she sleeps with Dean while hes still married. It happens when things are going down between Dean and Lindsay but even so, he is still married and Lindsay is actually trying to work on their relationship making his favorite meal.
Same with Logan. She has no problem sleeping at his place while hes engaged. On top of that, she does have a boyfriend who she tends to forget about. Then she gets all bummed out when Logan calls her and tells her his fiance is back.
Did Rory ever have any boyfriends she didnt cheat on or cheat with?

She complains she doesnt have a job but turns down when shes offered. Its nice to pursue the career she wants but in real life, we need to make a living. We need to do what we dont want to do especially right after the graduation. 
She looks down on Kirk at the dance marathon saying he has no careers but he has had so many different kinds of jobs and tries to do his best whatever the jobs he has. Years later, she ends up being desperate to get a job. 

And fat shaming. Obviously about the ballet and also when she talks to Asher about her grade. In the end of the conversation, she says The red head has fat thighs. or something like that. I believe this was to attack Asher and it wasnt really about the girl but still, its not very nice.

I feel like if Rory did not have Lorelai as a mother, she would likely be regularly exercising. It might just be a cultural difference from the early 2000s to now, but I graduated from a similarly high-performing college to Rory, and all of my classmates who were similar to Rory in being perfectionists/high-achievers were into going to the gym, exercise classes, or running because it is something you are supposed to do to keep healthy and also it keeps stress-related anxiety down. It seems bizarre to me that someone like Rory would be so anti-exercise because I feel like anyone whos into rule-following and doing what youre supposed to do does at least a little bit of exercise.

I think if she had any other mother than Lorelai, Rory would regularly exercise. I dont think shed necessarily be an athlete, but she also wouldnt be as anti-exercise as she appears in the show. I think Lorelai just pushed all of her lifestyle choices on Rory and always made it a thing that they dont eat healthy or exercise and Rory was heavily pressured/embarrassed into following suit. 

The Marthas Vineyard episode particularly bugged me because Rory was finally doing things that a young adult should do (performing basic cooking and going to the gym) and Lorelai made a huge deal of it and was like lmao I want to go to the gym too I have GOT to see this, which just felt like a way to shame Rory out of these activities (even if not intentionally). You could argue that it was Rory changing herself for Logan, but I really think that was Rory starting to be her genuine self without influence from Lorelai.

Im curious on peoples thoughts on this. Particularly interested to hear from anyone who was in college around the same time as Rory, because I do feel like I might be overthinking this and its simply a cultural shift into exercise being more common now than then, but I honestly dont know.",21,1,False,self,,,,,

You would LL would have been more enthusiastic about the home-cooked, beautiful food she got to eat every friday since she lived off greasy food during the rest of the week, she acted like an ungrateful teenager who can't realize how good they have it. At least Rory mostly had enough maturity to not complain or be sarcastic about the food they were given..in a mansion for free .

Also it is unrealistic that Suki never offered to show the basics of cooking to either of the women considering she was LL' s best friend and was naturally helpful and and had spare time for years before Jackson and the kids.

I get that hes the dreamy guy. Hes rich, he has a private jet (or helicopter?), he buys her Herms, and so on. But hes capable of doing so because he was born rich.
Everyone says hes sweet but what would he offer if he wasnt rich? 
I like him for standing up for Rory when she gets attacked by her family though. 
He sure does care about Rory but so do Jess and Dean. (and even the poor boyfriend Rory tends to forget about.. and I forgot his nane too. Mark, was it?) 

Now I know this post is going to be downvoted as there are lots of Logan fans but this is what I think about him and Id like to know what you think so I can see new aspects.


And now the biggest question.
Who do you think Rory should be ending up with?

Id say Jess even though Dean is my favorite.
I think Jess is the only one who Rory never cheated on (though he cheated with him). 
And also, Jess is the only boyfriend who didnt cheat on her.
Dean cheats with Rory while being married to Lindsay.
Logan chats with her while hes engaged.
And obviously the boyfriend who Rory cheated on with Logan doesnt cheat on her, either but hes out of the question because he deserves better.

(Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/dzfqfv/second_binge_of_the_show_rorys_character_arc/,TheBee3sKneess,1574321078,"As a kid I loved the show. I was never emotionally close with my mother and I felt like Rory and Lorelai's was the dream. As an adult with a background in psych, I am able to recognize that their relationship is unhealthy as well, just a different type of unhealthy than emotional neglect. 

Honestly, I can write a whole essay on how Lorelai is the worse, but with the revival season I truly felt she finally grew as a person. The same goes for Emily and her final scenes made me incredibly happy for her. If the show was based just of those two characters, I would be completely content with how things ended.

However, Rory feels incredibly unfinished as a character and the revival just pushed her to the middle of her arc, not the end. I feel like Rory could be written much deeper than she is. When she went to go talk to her dad, I honestly got the impression she was asking him why he never fought for her. But the writers never clearly bring up how Rory feels about being raised just by her mom with her dad coming in and out. 

I feel like the story line is there for something deeper, but the writers wont actively say it and will just allow us to speculate. I mean look at all of Rorys relationships, they have been with men who are unavailable in one way or another. Dean scared her off with the I love you even though it's perfectly normal for teenagers to be saying that in the honeymoon phase. And ignoring Dean becoming possessive of her, she immediately went to jess whom is another great example of something deeper going on, but the writers never wanting to confirm. There are little dog whistles suggesting Jess had been in an unstable environment and abused. There was no way he could have a healthy relationship and was emotionally detached yet Rory tries to be with him anyways. 
After Jess, Dean is now unavailable, physically, and engaged which makes Rory want to be with him again. She sleeps with him while is married, he is now divorced to be with her, and she is emotionally moving onto another man-Logan.
Now, do to watching this show at a young age, I adore Logan even though there are so many red flags I now see as an adult. Like Jess, he is emotionally unavailable and clearly suffers from emotional neglect (really Gilmore Girls could be various examples of abuse if the writers wanted to go that road) based on his stranious relationship with the authority figures in the household. Also highlighted by the fact that he has never had a girlfriend which may sound charming at first, but incredibly strange based on how much he flirts with various women. 

The writers have written Rory to fall for men that will disappoint her and they never address where exactly this comes from. They never let Rory address any gripes with her childhood at all. I don't want to say she has Daddy issues because that is usually sexist and puts the weight of not having a dad on the child and not the parent responsible. However, you model romantic relationships based on what you have seen as a kid. Rory has seen her father come and go and her mom being extremely impulsive with her partners. 

I just really wish they would let this girl realistically analyze her life. Who knows, maybe that will happen with writing the book. But we as the audiance do now know. We dont know if she learns from her childhood and keep Logan out of their childs life.  We dont know if she ever confronts feelings that are seemingly there. Rory has the potential to be a great character. She could show how complex life is and sometimes parents make the worst decisions with the best intentions, but they only just let her start diving into that with the revival and never concluded it. 

I know there probably wont be a second season and the writers feel the story has come ""full circle"" but Rory feels like she has a tone of loose threads.

They say that Lorelei destroyed Christophers life because of the pregnancy. How can they say that if Christopher didnt participate in parenting at all?
They dont blame him for not playing a role as a father but they blame Lorelei (who raised their grand daughter) for ruining his life. Then because of that, they have no interest in Rory at all. 
If he had wanted to go to Princeton, he couldve gone. Its not like he wasnt making money to provide Lorelei and Rory anyway. Do they mention what he was doing after they found out she was pregnant? 
All I remember is he wasnt again the idea of getting married.


Second, April.

I just cant help but wonder how Luke or anyone in the town had no recognition of April.
I dont know exactly where she lives but she goes to the diner by bicycle, which means wherever shes living shouldnt be so far for a 12 years old kid to go back and forth.
Its a small town and everyone knows everything about everyone. Someone must have seen Anna with a kid once or twice at least. The shouldnt be slim.

Sorry first, my English not good much so maybe what I start to confess now, if have something wrong I hope u will skip. I'm Vietnamese, my husband's Romanian. We fall in love when he was travell in my country. After that, he took me come his country and we decided to marry. We live with his parent, I helped his mom everything such as cook, clean, wash clothes, ... It wouldn't be worth it if they didn't do these things to me (p/s: please read all before u tell me selfish)
1. His mom really lazy, she didn't cook anything. Before I always cooked for everyone in home, when I went to supermarket to buy materials, I always buy for 3-4 days. One time, she took all materials to makes soup, exactly is ridiculous soup, I didn't know what kind of that soup cuz it looks so terrible. So I not have enough time go to buy new and cook, then I told my husband eat what she cooked. After that, she told with everyone knowing me that I cooked nothing for my husband, so bad cuz her son married me. Yah u not read wrong, it just happen ONE TIME. From that, I just cooked enough for myself and my husband.
2. With my husband, his dad n his mom are everything. But he didn't know, they just looked him like a tool to make money. I really care about his healthy cuz he stay in laptop more than 12 hours per day. Do u thinking about they took from my husband 2.500 /month, sometime more? Just when they need, he will give them. So now in his mind, he needs to make more money to support his family. His mom like a rat around in home, no work, do nothing, spent all time for playing with cat. His dad work wooden furniture, not hard-working, always complain and addictive with alcohols. They lazy to work but spend money likes a king.
3. His mom always put in his mind how to against me. When she offended and louder with me, I still keeps silent cuz I don't want him hard between me and his mom. I don't know what she wants, I did nothing with her but she always found the way to makes me down. If my husband had decided for himself, everything will fine. But so unlucky that he think his mom always right and I always wrong. And one time, I saw the message between my husband and his mom. His mom said that I came here because his money. OMG, I have everything in my country: good job, friends, family, delicious food, ... I change everything to come here with him, and now I deserve what she thinks? 
4. Someone kind or take care of me, his mom will be rude with them too. I have 2 new friends in here, they're friends with my husband from kid and they're couple. When I came out with them, his mom always called and offended them. They don't care and fuck her hard back cuz they care about me more. Everytime. She's not my mom, even my mon never did that with my friends.
5. U will ask about where the money they bought apartment in the past. All of that, grandma support. Before my husband makes money, grandma support everything for them. They completely dependent on grandma. And when my husband can makes money, they completely dependent on him.

Still have so many things about his parent, but I think it's enough to makes u recognize what I been through. Just 6 months but I near to crazy. Don't ask me why I'm not return Vietnam to live, I did but I love my husband, when I return, he will back to the time order foods everyday, work like hell, drunk like crazy, so I keeps stay here and after 1 month we will move to new apartment.

why was rory so out of the loop about so many things? like when she came back to Yale from a *two month* long summer trip to Europe with Emily and realises that everyone had a productive summer but her. she even says on the phone to her mother that she hadn't even thought of an internship! what kind of academically driven/intelligent student, one who tried so hard to get into harvard and onto the yale paper, doesn't *even think* about a summer intern???? what's worse is she was completely aware of the fact that she didn't think. rory didn't think? the girl with her pros and cons lists and plans... didn't think? why does ASP always pull these bs out of character moves like the plot of rory and lorelai, the laziest people in the whole show, going... backpacking. *yeah right*

it then got me thinking and reminded me of when she was completely clueless about the franklin and having to take part in extracurriculars for her college application. there are probably other incidents too that i can't remember. are we really supposed to believe that rory is so sheltered and uninformed about the one thing she's been wanting to be for most of her life? i mean, if you have a goal, any goal, you do your research and carry out the steps you need to get yourself there. was rory expecting to just walk into harvard and be christiane amanpour. there are so many tiny things that irk me about the show but here i am... on my nth rewatch oops",70,1,False,self,,,,,

In the pilot when Lorelai says she found a job after running away, Emily says ""As a maid. With all your brains and talent."" and later in episode 15 Richard says ""I had to tell my friends, my colleagues, that my only daughter, the brightest in her class, was pregnant and was leaving school."" They pretty much make it sound like she was also bound for an Ivy League college and have some sort of high profile career. 

But then there are moments where they make it sound like they wanted her to be a wife like Emily. Also in the pilot Emily says ""Your father would have put him (Christopher) in the insurance business and you'd be living a lovely life right now.""

Marry a Yale man and get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny or Shih Tzu."" Emily and Richard are also still upset that Lorelai never had a coming out party.

The more you tell a teen or child no the more it becomes more appealing to them. I think Lorelai shoving Dean down Rorys throat made her not like him anymore or at least start to lose interest. And Jess was more mysterious and intriguing. I'm older now and guys like Jess no longer phase me as an adult at 23 I'd like someone less clingy and less hostile but more of Deans good traits.

I really liked Dean I felt like Rory wlda stayed with him if everyone didn't constantly throw him down her throat. I do realize they were 16 and each other's first loves so that made them so clingy and hostile and terrible at communication. I haven't gotten to the affair yet. This is my first time watching GG and I'm on S2E21. 

I think Dean was a good bf just he did need to work on his anger bc sometimes he made me think he was gonna hit her or something and he needed to learn to not be so jealous and insecure but then I wonder is it really him being insecure? Bc we all can tell when our SO are falling for someone else. Bc I hate when it's pretty obvious you're SO is liking someone else and you call them out and you're being called jealous and insecure. It's not healthy to act that way BUT I think that's how you wld act at 16. As an adult yes unacceptable but he was hurting bc he saw this girl he loved so much falling for someone else. I remember being 16 and that hurting like hell and spazzing out. I remember doing it at 22 before I finally went to therapy.

Rory is beginning to date Logan and Lorelei is not being the least bit supportive and she keeps saying things that give me the sense that she thinks she knows better than Rory. I get that she is a mom and wants to be protective but at the same time she has always been upset at Emily for having that same thought and pushing her own agenda. 

I just think that Lorelei lacks so much self awareness. In this instance she doesnt even give Logan a chance but instantly gets upset when Rory says that they are boyfriend-girlfriend. She always says that she trusts her and thinks she raised such a smart, trustworthy, intelligent, and insightful person yet, when given the chance, she doesnt give Rory the benefit
Of the doubt that she *gasp might know whats best for herself and what her heart wants at the moment. 

Granted, I dont know how the Rory-Logan situation ends up and Loreleis concern could end up being valid. However, at this point, I dont feel as if Logan has done anything wrong. He has been very clear to Rory about his intentions and who he was and what he wanted. Rory getting hurt was crappy, but also something she knew could happen. Im all for someone setting up clear boundaries. I am not for someone intentionally hurting someone or unintentionally hurting someone by lack of clear boundaries. He did neither of those and I feel thats important.

There is some passive aggression and obvious discomfort, but by the end of the evening Emily and Mia share a nice moment in which Emily subtly thanks her for caring for Lorelai and Rory. Lorelai overhears this and, combining that moment with the moment between her and Mia earlier (in which Mia informs her of Emilys visit to the Inn years ago), Lorelai seems to have a better understanding of Emilys feelings.  

The episode ends with the three of them returning to the hotel and watching The Pursuit of Happyness together. After a million rewatches, I made a connection that may or may not mean anything but Id like to think it does....

When Lorelai tells her parents about her and Luke splitting up, their reactions (or lack there of) result in Lorelai going through a mini identity crisis. Why does she like what she likes? Is it because she actually likes it, or because her parents dont? Included in the list of experimental objects were Poptarts, tying her shoes differently, and wearing her hair up in a clip. 

Emily comes to the Inn to bring her Cotillion group for tea, and notes Lorelais hair and that she likes it like that. At the time of course, Lorelai makes a face.
