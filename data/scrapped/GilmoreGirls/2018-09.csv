**Go, Bulldogs!** - Christopher (David Sutcliffe) talks Lorelai (Lauren Graham) into visiting Rory (Alexis Bledel) at Yale during Parents' Weekend, and Lorelai is surprised to find that Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) are also there. Trying to prove how cool he is, Christopher invites all of Rory's co-workers on the Yale Daily News to an expensive lunch where they all drink too much, and the meal ends abruptly when Rory insists they leave to cover a breaking story. Meanwhile, Luke (Scott Patterson) meets April's (Vanessa Marano) swimming coach (guest star Mia Cottet), who convinces him to take her adult swimming class. When the coach flirts with him, Luke asks her out on a date.

In 'Say Something' after Christopher causes a rift between the couple at Emily and Richards wedding, Sookie tries to comfort Lorelai with the story about the couple that broke up and got back together forty years later, essentially missing their middle.  Then when Lorelai is pleading with Luke at the grocery store in town, she says she's worried the two of them not communicating will cause them to miss their 'middle'. 

In season seven, you can see how the writers start to follow Sookie's story. Lorelai goes off and marries Christopher, Luke begins dating and bonds with his kid. Even though they back together in the final scenes of the original series we don't see them together again until AYITL and they've basically frozen in time. 

Its actually really harsh of the writers to do this, even though they got back together, in many ways they still missed their middle despite not being apart. They never fixed their communication issues (and still don't quite in the revival) , they never discussed having children or getting married. All things that help quantify the 'middle'. 

In summary, after re-watching 'Say Something', I dislike the revival even more . ",9,30,False,self,,,,,

I found it cheap that Paul would exist in the show at all knowing that Rory still was involved with Logan. And Logans fianc was completely unnecessary. They could have had Logan married to his work, if they needed something to keep Rory and Logan from being fully together. And it was so casually portrayed it hurt me just to watch neither of them care for their SOs in a significant way. It felt corny, brushed off, and lazy. Sigh. Nothing in the revival was untouched by the newfound ridiculousness/theatricality of ASP. Will not be watching again.

The rugged bad boy of Rorys boyfriends. I have struggled with my feelings about Jess since I started watching the show in second grade. The debate of which of Rorys boyfriends is best is a long time tradition among die hard Gilmore fans. Overall I think all of Rorys boyfriends have both wonderful and horrible attributes but Jess has always hit me differently from the others because of his potential to be so perfect. Hes so close and yet so far that the Jess fan club just cant resist. 

Now, theres no doubt that Jess has an annoying attitude. The whole the worlds out to get me vibe is way childish and tired out. He has zero concern about how he effects others which he proves by being incredibly rude to Lorelei when they first meet, not to mention Rorys grandma when he meets her for THE FIRST TIME. Who does that? He doesnt seem to have any ambition whatsoever. Hes perfectly fine working at Walmart for life instead of acing classes he could easily ace and bettering himself. He has extremely poor communication skills. Half the time hes too busy playing the cool guy to actually open up to Rory or Luke when its most important. Most of his relationship with Rory could have been solved if he would stop being so prideful and communicate. (Now I am fully aware that Rory plays a part in why they didnt last as well, but thats another discussion). So looking at all this, lets just be honest: Jess has A LOT of growing up to do.

On the other hand, Jess does make an effort in his own ways. Yes he was a jerk to Emily at dinner but he did show up for Rory despite not wanting to. And he does things for Rory more than once throughout the series (even if it is with a bad attitude). The point is hes TRYING and that goes a long way for me. I do believe that Jess whole heartedly cares for Rory and Luke, he just sucks at showing it. Leaving without telling Rory, while shitty, he did because he didnt want to hurt her anymore. Theres no doubt that hes very intelligent, which lets face it, is hot. He is sarcastic funny, which I adore and he pushes Rory to step out of her comfort zone. I truly think he makes Rory a little more daring, which ultimately helps her in the long run. Being a journalist requires cahoonas and Jess definitely helps her find that in herself. (This is also a reason I like Logan, sorry not sorry). 

Honestly, In the end Jess turns out great, it just KILLS me how long it takes him to get there. And Im sure a certain degree of why we love him so much is due to how charming Milo Ventimiglia portrays him, because lets be honest, he is attractive as hell and a great performer.

I just keep thinking about Rory's first lunch with Naomi Shropshire, where Naomi calls them kindred spirits and then remarks, ""Everything tastes so much better when it's stolen.""

&amp;#x200B;

And I can't help wondering if that line is meant to shine a little bit of light on Rory's motives and behavior.  (I mean, yes, in-universe Naomi is only talking about herself, but it was deliberately included in the script and maybe I'm reading to much into it, but it feels significant.)

&amp;#x200B;

And I know we've all been kind of baffled by Rory's relationships in AYITL.  Especially her and Logan's Vegas arrangement.  But I was thinking of all the times Rory is drawn to someone she shouldn't be - Jess when she's with Dean, Dean when he's married to Lindsay, Logan when she was still with Dean (arguably), Logan when he's engaged...

&amp;#x200B;

I think it makes sense that Rory, who spends so much time and effort being ""good"" and following the rules, and jumping through hoops to please authority figures, is also drawn to the idea of breaking the rules (especially at times of heightened stress), and has a drive to act out / rebel in this way.

&amp;#x200B;

In that light, I even think her one night stand with the Wookie makes a little sense.  At first, it was baffling because Rory has always been a relationship girl and it's hard to imagine her even being comfortable in a one night stand, especially with a random guy in a costume (and not even an attractive costume!)...  But, from the perspective that she was on a job she hated and frustrated that she'd even agreed to take it, I can see the ""I'm not supposed to do this"" factor being a powerful enticement.

Anyway, so that's my random thought.",31,70,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Introducing Lorelai Planetarium** - Lorelai (Lauren Graham) invites Rory (Alexis Bledel) over to dinner to tell her that she and Christopher (David Sutcliffe) got married in Paris. Rory pretends to be thrilled while Christopher is in the room, but later tells Lorelai how hurt and angry she really is. Back in town for the start-up of his new internet company, Logan (Matt Czuchry) invites Rory to the launch party, where she meets a magazine editor who suggests she write an article on the event. Rory writes a judgmental article, describing the guests as spoiled elitists. Logan is hurt and angry, accusing Rory of hypocrisy since she is living rent-free in his apartment. Defensive at first, Rory realizes she is living a double standard and decides to find her own apartment. Meanwhile, when April (Vanessa Marano) faces a medical emergency, a frantic Luke (Scott Patterson) turns to Lorelai for help.

"" Now I don't doubt that the work was good since Rory is a smart girl but I find it funny how they kind of mentioned the topic of Rory's entitlement resulting from everybody praising her for everything that annoys us so much. 

Also, even though it was an episode to show how Chris has improved aka being a functional adult, I found it really heartbreaking how excited Rory was when he confirmed to come to the ball. Like she's been disappointed so often by him being an absentee father that she barely could believe he'd really show up.

Same shy, introverted personality. Same face, big blue eyes, same everything. A genetic copy &amp; paste.

The reason I started watching Gilmore Girls, because of Alexis Bledels uncanny resemblance to my GF. 
_________________________________________________________

I was channel surfing one day, bored out of my mind, landed on ABC Family, and Gilmore Girls was on. Id heard OF it, but had never seen an episode, so I decided to check it out. This was back in mid-2008, so the show had just run its course. I dont remember what episode it was, but I just remember when Rory came onto the screen, it was like.whoa, just got a reason to watch this show now.  (*Terrible, I know.*)

 It was my way of seeing her, without her being actually around in-person.  I initially just started watching it for Rory &amp; her scenes &amp; drama, and just kinda tuned-out when any of the subsidiary characters were the focal point.

But starting from Season 1, all the way up to The Revival, Ive genuinely fallen in love with this show, all the wacky characters juxtaposed against the serious drama. 

Gilmore Girls is a great show. 
_________________________________________________________

And the whole reason I started watching it is (honestly) because of Ms. Rory Gilmores mysterious physical likeness to my EX. I could never get enough of her, so seeing Rory on-screen was my way of seeing her, when werent  together.
___________________________________________________

Well, as this show proves, things happen, things didnt last. After 10 years together, and finally getting her pregnant, she (rather cruelly and abruptly) decided to leave me back in June. She left, and took our unborn child with her. A bit of a blow to the heart.

Now, whenever I watch Gilmore Girls, and see Rory on-screen, it just reminds me of her. And its a rather painful experience. The very reason I got into the show, is now the reason its hard to watch.

At all. But as a long time viewer, I like to try to add my own depth to them based on what we see on screen. At the end of the day, most things the characters do come down to entertainment value. I get that.**   


I'm watching Rory's Birthday Parties and thinking about how upset Emily gets when Rory doesn't like the party. I think there's a lot of reasons for that, some of which include her flaws (she's prideful, inconsiderate, and controlling) but I also think there's a big factors for why Emily deals so negatively with perceived rejection: Validation. I think so much of Emily's behavior could be brought down to everyone constantly invalidating everything about her. She begins to over-react to literally everything, with no middle ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

Emily is regarded very poorly by her family. I know the story is about Lorelai's tragic upbringing, but I actually believe there is a great sadness in Emily's life. She went to college, got married, and became a corporate wife and SAHM. Which would be fine because she enjoys it, but her husband regards her entire lifestyle as frivolous and unimportant. Richard mentions her ""social engagements,"" ""frivolous parties,"" and is deeply saddened when Rory seems good at event planning (yes, what a tragedy. She's efficient, a good manager, and has an eye for design as well as marketing skills. Just like her grandmother. And her mother: But Lorelai gets paid, so it's different) and goes off about how Rory is supposed to have ""more."" He's ungrateful for the role his wife plays in his success and oblivious to the things she sacrificed to get their family to the place they were in. Again, don't get me wrong: The life Emily led was perfectly valid, and I don't think she wanted to be a career woman. But she gave up those options to be Richard's partner and create the life they both wanted and Richard seems to believe she's just a silly woman.   


And then her daughter grows up and hates/looks down on literally everything about her. **I am not blaming Lorelai for Emily's faults as a mother. I'm not even calling Emily a ""good"" mom.  I totally understand why Lorelai wanted to leave.** But Lorelai has a HUGE superiority complex about \*everything\* regarding Emily, not just her mother's faults. The kind of music her mother listens to, the music she enjoys, the food she eats, the activities she likes, the way she decorates, the people she associates with... Lorelai rags on every single bit of it with all the arrogance she accuses Emily of having and none of the self-awareness. It's so upsetting to watch sometimes, particularly after season one, when it seems like everyone is constantly gas-lighting Emily. Nothing about her is valid or worthy 95% of the time. It's upsetting.   


  
**Here's what I'm NOT saying: All of this would make it okay for Emily to treat people like trash, or makes her an eternal victim in every circumstance. No no no no no. Emily does terrible things and deserves the heat for them. I just think that the people in her life treat her with a lot of the same derision they accuse her of.** ",14,76,False,self,,,,,

The next day, Lorelai and Christopher get into a fight over whether they should exchange vows at the elaborate wedding party Emily (Kelly Bishop) is throwing for them. Luke contacts a lawyer over his custody troubles with Anna, then runs into Christopher and the two have an ugly confrontation in the streets of Stars Hollow. Meanwhile, when Logan (Matt Czuchry) discovers that Rory and Marty (Wayne Wilcox) have been pretending that they just met, rather than admitting their previous friendship to Lucy (Krysten Ritter), he reveals the truth to Lucy. Finally, Emily gives Lorelai a warning about her marriage.

Watching season 7 is weird for me for a lot of reasons, mostly because I feel like the dialogue is off and the pacing is really quick and choppy compared to the previous seasons.

Still, I think it's a very interesting season, and I like how new topics and new interactions are explored.

For example, I like finally seeing Lorelai and Chris in a real, committed, long-term-enough-for-them relationship. They will never be OTP for me, but I was fascinated by their attempt at being married, which was of course doomed for failure from the very beginning. I was very intruigued to watch the relationship unfold, up until its ending. 

I was also very, very curious to see how Lorelai and Luke will mend their broken relationship and overcome their mutual heartbreak. I mean, who wasn't? It felt like the mending of their bond was made with care and respect to the audience, even though it felt a bit rushed, which I believe to be inherent to the fact that it was happening during the show's final season. 

As for Rory's storylines, even though I find Lucy and Olivia unlikable and I believe ASP would never have created them, I like how Rory finally has a chance to make some friends in college, and in life - considering that even in the Revial she only has the same two (now distant) friendships she had since adolescence, with Lane and Paris. 

I also like seeing how Rory suddenly has to deal with a conflict (as strange as it was) in an area that was not family, school/paper, or romance, for a change. Before that, any friendship-related conflicts she had were very brief - except the one with Paris in season 3, a good 4 seasons before that (I consider their conflict in season 6 to be brief, since it lasted for only two episodes). 

Also, Rory's relationship with Logan seemed to finally find a balance. I was exhausted by it by season 6, and I liked how relaxed it felt in season 7. And I also appreciated the ecounters Logan and Lorelai shared, they seemed genuine enough. 

Overall, not a great season by any means, but I wasn't bored or super annoyed by it, but rather interested, something that I can't say about season 6 or AYITL.",24,73,False,self,,,,,

The only time I thought they had a possibility of being together and when they had their best chemistry was season 1 (the episode where he brings ice to Rory's party and then the episode where she offers to paint his place).

But for some reason, after that, I just got the sense that they were better friends. I thought it was an incredible friendship, and they were there for each other when times where tough. I could have even done without the obvious Luke is so into Lorelai overtones, and rather have him be her gruff almost family member. 

Something about them made me uncomfortable as a romantic pairing too. Luke did not seem like the right fit for Lorelai at all, and honestly, I'm not sure who exactly was right for Luke. I especially hated Season 6, especially when they go to Martha's Vineyard, I thought to myself, is this who Lorelai really wants to spend the rest of her life with? It was so awful to watch. It also was strange they made Anna like almost a carbon copy of Lorelai, like I get it show, Luke's into the same woman...but why? These women frustrate him to no end and make him angry. I think I am tired of the trope where it's ""grumpy man begrudgingly loves his quirky partner"" that I have seen a lot of lately. 

It would have nice to have Lorelai end up single, or always dating different people like seasons 1-4 on the show. Her life is so full of happiness and people, she never really needed a partner in her life to make it happier. And it would be right up ASP ally, as a lot of famous women in history had significant relationships in their lives, and they were all important and it was more than one person.

The thing that pisses me off about this scene is that Rory invites herself in, she reciprocates Jess' kisses and then WILLINGLY moves to the bed. Yes, I perfectly understand that no means no, but y'all act as if Rory had to fight Jess off of herself. He backed off after the second no. Then Rory proceeds to victimise herself by running off to Dean. She knows that Dean has it out for Jess yet she just has to air out their dirty laundry to the one person she shouldn't. 

I've seen people say that following the fight Jess feels badly for how he treated Rory which is why he walks away and doesn't talk to her. While I do think that he partially felt bad for how he treated her, I think that he felt humiliated more than anything else. I would, if the person I was with ran to their ex and then that ex sucker punched me in regards to something that doesn't and shouldn't even concern them. 

Viewers tend to vilify Jess in this scene without even realising that Rory victimised herself to make him look like the bad guy. Honestly, who runs off crying to their ex? She knew what she was doing by telling Dean, she wanted someone to coddle her instead of actually facing the situation. 

Also, people seem to disregard the fact that Jess was not in a good mood/right head space. You're not you when you're angry. I know that that sounds cliche (and that someone in the comments is going to say that I'm an apologist of some sort) but hey, it is a tv show, they're bound to use tropes. 

For me to actually consider this as sexual assualt, it would've had to be more graphic. I think that in this current social atmosphere; sjw's and third wave feminists exaggerate many things. I highly doubt that people would've considered this sexual assault in the 2000s. As people have revised the show in the 2010s, they've blown it out of proportion. 

Plus, if ASP had wanted the audience to register it as sexual assualt, Rory would have been traumatised and there would have been serious ramifications for Jess and a message would've been communicated.

Rory has a fight with Logan (Matt Czuchry) over his immature reaction to his business disaster, and agrees to go on the trip with Lorelai. Emily (Kelly Bishop) invites herself along in an effort to get away from Richard (Edward Herrmann), who is driving her crazy while he recuperates at home. At the wedding, Emily is upset by the close relationship Mia shares with Lorelai and Rory. Lorelai learns that Emily came to see Mia five years earlier to ask for pictures of Lorelai and Rory during the years they were estranged. Logan makes a surprise appearance and asks Rory to forgive him. Meanwhile, Lane (Keiko Agena) and Zack (Todd Lowe) ask Luke (Scott Patterson) to be the godfather to their twins. Finally, Lane goes into labor and Luke helps get everyone to the hospital.

**Hay Bale Maze** - As Stars Hollow prepares for its annual Spring Fling festival, Rory (Alexis Bledel) brings Logan (Matt Czuchry) home and shows him around town. Lorelai (Lauren Graham) sees how serious their relationship has become and worries that Logan is too irresponsible for Rory. Taylor (Michael Winters) angers the town by spending the entire Spring Fling budget on a huge hay bale maze. At an unexpected encounter in the maze, Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) apologize to one another and admit they both made mistakes that lead to the end of their engagement. Meanwhile, Rory has a job interview with the Providence Journal-Bulletin and struggles with decisions about her future.

Gilmore Girls has all of that in spades, and I feel is masterful at telling stories that unfold between people. It's easy to get pulled into their world and to root for our favorite characters, and fall in love with them.

I realize it is fiction, but I would like to think I have learned some real lessons along the way, and in some ways I believe it has had an impact on who I am as a person. When I am at my best I try to be someone who would have made my favorite characters proud. I believe I have gotten a lot of good things from the show.

But sometimes I wonder if I have also developed unrealistic dreams of love and romance. Now in my late 30's, I feel rather sad an unfulfilled and there are a number of reasons for that. But one of them is that I feel empty romantically, as though a piece of me is missing. I am with someone whom I love, and who loves me, and for that I am very lucky and grateful. But we do not connect in the ways I would have hoped. 

To see Luke and Lorelai go through everything they have, and overcome their obstacles and find love makes me happy, but sometimes I can't help but wonder - is my Lorelai out there? I feel like I have a lot of love and kindness built up that I will never get to share, that will just go to waste. I sometimes imagine how nice it would be to fall in love with someone who was feeling alone and struggling but getting by - how I would dedicate my life to helping her and trying my best to make her happy. Maybe that's some archaic 'guy brain' thinking, but it would feel nice to be needed or to be helpful in some way.

There are at least three occasions where Lorelai and Emily are just downright rude to healthcare professionals. Also, ASP seems to think, as many lay people do, that every woman in the hospital is a nurse. As a nurse, I can't help but be offended. I didn't go to school for four years and earn a degree in nursing to stand behind a desk and fill out forms.

-In S1E10 Forgiveness and Stuff:  Emily is arguing with Jane Lynch, presumably a nurse since she's got a stethoscope around her neck, about ""forms."" First of all, a nurse would not be getting insurance information. That's an entirely different department in the hospital - someone from the business office would be there, usually in the room (or ER cubicle) with the patient and the family member. They take a copy of the insurance card and some form of ID and might ask a question or two, and then they'd be on their way. In this scene, Emily is extremely rude and Lorelai comes up and basically threatens the nurse that if the nurse doesn't go see how Richard is, Lorelai will leave Emily there to discuss the situation with the nurse - obviously a fate worse than death. Not to mention that they would not withhold information about a patient from a family member because they didn't fill out a form.

-In S2E19 Teach me Tonight:  Rory and Jess get in a car accident and Rory is in the ER. Lorelai bursts in and demands to see Rory (not blaming her for that, anyone would do the same) but she threatens the nurse(?) receptionist(?) that she will act like Shirley MacLaine in Terms of Endearment if she isn't shown to Rory's cubicle immediately. Rude and manipulative. When she gets to the cubicle, she grills the MD about what tests he's performed (again, anyone would do the same) in an extremely condescending manner.  Also they say that the ""nurse"" will bring Rory to x-ray - I mean, when is a nurse pushing a wheelchair to x-ray? Another department, again - this would fall to the Transport department in any hospital, even a small community hospital.

In S7EP13, I'd Rather Be in Philadelphia:  Emily assumes the nurse (I think this is a nurse, she's wearing scrubs-usually a unit secretary doesn't wear scrubs) should know who her husband is because she says her name is Emily Gilmore. The nurse is supposed to assume that, because of her surname, she must be there for Richard Gilmore. Presumptuous. She then belittles the woman for being kind and cheerful and further insults her when she apologizes. Emily calms down considerably when the doctor arrives, and then asks this big cardiac surgeon if the room Richard will be transferred to after his stint in the CICU has a window - AND THE DOC APPEARS TO CONTEMPLATE IT AND SAYS THAT HE THINKS THERE IS A WINDOW.  Ok, come on. What cardiac surgeon would know if there's a window in a room on the floor? And what cardiac surgeon has time to squire a patient's family member around the hospital to show her the room?
