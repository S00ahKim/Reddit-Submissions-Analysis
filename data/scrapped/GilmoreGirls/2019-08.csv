- Lorelai becomes friends with Tweeny Halpern, makes Emily upset, so she does follow through on that promise to hold dar meetings at the inn 
- The inn starts to lose money, Richard decides to become a shareholder in it to help things out, which means he starts hanging around more. Him and Lorelai fight, a lot, but are able to hash some things out as his health starts declining
-Michel and Lorelai start to hang out more
-Kirk and Lulu decide to adopt after seeing what a great parent Luke is, and they buy the Twickam house to have a place for their family and Cat Kirk
-April and Lorelai begin to form a relationship 
-Luke begins to attend Friday night dinners, hijinks ensue 
-Kyon comes back, gets into a relationship with Brian, and gets a job at the inn. I think Kyon is hilarious

- Lanes grandmother comes back for another visit, stresses out Mrs. Kim

- Paris and Doyle move to Boston

4. Zach proposing to Lane
5. Logan proposing to Rory
6. Chris proposing in Season 1
7. The Parisian proposal- Christopher
*AYITL Lorelai telling Luke they should get married (does this count?) 

Weird thing about proposals on this show is they are mostly done spontaneously and to end arguments/lock someone down. There is no communication beforehand about marriage (which is just a TV trope in general) When Max proposed, he had just finished having an argument with Lorelai, which started with him being jealous of Luke. Lorelai proposing was after a blowout with her parents and Rory. Zach had just broken up the band and had a jealous moment with Brian, of all people. Even in AYITL, Lorelai proposing comes right after Luke has his emotional outburst because he thinks Lorelai is going to leave him. Christopher proposes to Lorelai when they are having an argument about his lack of reliability. Chris' proposal, second time around is so romantic, but as he admits later, he pushes her because he is afraid to lose her. Dean also proposes off screen, but presumably is not over Rory. Instead of talking these things out (another general TV trope) they go right in for the proposal. 

The show is self aware- Lorelai mentions when Max proposes that a proposal is ""not a way to end an argument"" and that it should be a grand romantic gesture. Whether you believe that or not, the implication still exists that it should be thought out.

40,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2019-8-4,2019,8,4,2,cll3l1,self.GilmoreGirls,Season 3 Dean is peak Dean. Let's applaud his patience.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/cll3l1/season_3_dean_is_peak_dean_lets_applaud_his/,ALonelyTrashApple,1564851983,"I mean, I'm not a big fan of Dean for most of the show. I think that he had a very lackluster personality before Jess (he's not shown without Rory or without being a facet of her love life) and then that whole Dean/Rory part 3 is just a disaster that ruins his character.

But season 3 Dean is peak Dean. He leaves Rory and then gets a personality, one that is hilarious and rivaling Jess's snark (let's pretend ""my town"" didn't happen for a second because that was weird). That scene where Jess takes his order and wants to murder him is one of the funniest in the show imo. (I think that if the writers really knew what they were doing, Jess &amp; Dean could have become a really unexpectedly hilarious and grudging friendship instead of having Jess f\*ck off to California and Dean become a moron)

No matter what I think, though, Dean has superhuman patience. I screech like something inhuman every time this scene happens:

&gt;Rory: ""You think youre bugging me sitting in front of me staring like that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Jess: ""You think youre bugging me dancing in front of me staring like that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: ""Im not staring at you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jess: ""Then how do you know Im staring at you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: ""I am dancing. I cannot control where my glance goes. And the few moments that I can control it, my glance goes to Dean, not to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Jess: ""So you cant control when you look at me, but you have to force yourself to look at him? Sorry, man. Thats cold.** 

If I was Dean, I'd have to beat the shit out of Jess. The fact that he doesn't is truly admirable. And the scenes after that are the first time I really felt anything for Dean (besides 'aww, that's kinda cute'). When he takes Lorelai's place on the dance floor and hugs Rory close, it looks like he could believe that she still wants to be with him. He definitely still wants to be with her.

&gt;Jess: ""Im gonna sit here as long as I like, and Im gonna do whatever I like, and if you dont like it, then just ignore me and pay attention to your boyfriend.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dean: ""She can't. I'm not her boyfriend anymore.""

Not only is this the peak moment of the show for me, it made me give a crap about Dean like I hadn't before. It's the first time he has a *great* line. And then he goes up and up and up... until he's married.",10,14,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

**Rory-**

&amp;#x200B;

The reason Rory is so much earlier, at least in my head, is because she didn't label the feeling as ""love"" even while they were dating. She eventually says ""I think I might have loved you"" in Those Are Strings, Pinocchio, admitting that she had feelings even if she didn't label them herself. Because she was with Dean, she didn't let herself think about her feelings and that just let them grow unattended, leading to the 2.22 kiss. That was her admitting that she had incredibly powerful feelings and after that she felt as though she had a claim over him (especially when she saw him sucking face with Shane). I think Rory stumbled through her feelings and only examined them afterwards, realizing that she was in love. 

Jess on the other hand was VERY aware that felt a lot for Rory and had probably never had that before, which would lead him to holding Rory in a special place that made his feelings linger for years afterward (not that Rory didn't also care for him in season 6, she just knew she loved Logan and didn't want to hurt him like she hurt Dean). He would have taken it slow with the labels, until he was sure.

I was so happy with Zach when he sacked up and admitted he was wrong and got Hep Alien back together!

Lane's weddings made me laugh so hard because of how Mrs. Kim basically turned into Lane in that moment and her comment to Rory to that effect made me chuckle quite a bit.

Bridesmaids Revisited was kind of a miss for me. Maybe I'll dig more into that one on a re-watch or a one off

The Real Paul Anka had me in stitches!

Luke hosting the birthday party was painful to watch and Lorelai saving the day was a wonderful turn of events.

Logan being a jackass and getting hurt like he did felt like a forced plot device to endear Rory to him. Although Paris making the nurse cry was one of my favorite Paris moments.

Rory giving Mitchum Huntsberger the business was one of my favorite moments of all time! She finally found her voice and became the woman she needs to be. 

Talking about the Rory Gilmore da da da at Yale is one of my favorite cold opens of the series and one of two in season six alone. 

The straight up troubadour turf war is HILARIOUS! Watching Taylor have a coronary always brings me joy!

Driving Miss Gilmore made me laugh so hard until it made me so sad. The jokes about the vehicle, the delayed phone call from Richard, and then the big reveal of what him and Emily were planning dropped the mood like a bomb.

OMG THE ASTRONOMY BUILDING! OH BOY! YIKES! 

Lorelai and Luke this season! Like OMG crap or get off the pot! You're not Luke and Laura!

Favorite characters this season: Miss Patty, Jackson, Michel (always), Lane (for being a never-say-die badass with that she wants), and Cesar (who finally got some great bits this season)

Least favorite characters: April (she could have not been in this season at all and nothing would have changed except the pace of the wedding of Luke and Lorelai), Sookie just wasn't much for me this season, Lorelai was kind of flat to me save for the reaction to Emily's plan."")",1,3,False,spoiler,,,,,

Gilmore Girls makes me genuinely feel safe and happy and I wanted to share. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you are looking for some sign that someone cares or that the world cares or you aren't looking for a sign, but you feel bad? You're gonna be okay. 

This is way easier than calling and you do NOT have to be suicidal to talk, I'm not and they still helped me. This is US based, not sure if it works for other places.

I haven't seen all the cast but ones that spring to mind are:

Luke (Scott Patterson) in Saw (can't remember which one) but he was fine in it even if the film wasn't  
Rory (Alexis Bledel) in Sisters of the Travelling Pants (I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would) and I really liked her int  
Lorelai (Lauren Graham) in It's kind of a Funny Story though she wasn't in it for that long  
Lane (Keiko Agena) in 13 Reasons Why though I didn't realise it was her until afterwards

There are probably more but this is what comes to my mind at this time.

What was really interesting was Logan's reaction when Rory came back into the pub after he and Jess argued. Rory comes back, obviously in inner turmoil about her life and where it's heading, and Logan just gets his back up and makes the conversation all about him. Instead of supporting her an recognising this is a turning point for her to get her life back on track, he just ignores that and plays the ""woe is me card, I will forever have a steady income"". I just find Logan insanely selfish and not looking out for Rory's welfare at all; need we forget the sleeping with 50 other women while they weren't broken up, the constantly perusing her afterwards although she said no (harassment!!), the actually letting her steal a boat without asking questions etc etc etc

Luke and Lorelai have an extremely close friendship, one in which they feel comfortable ribbing and teasing each other without fear of offense being taken on either side.

Rory-defenders, cover your eyes; you aren't going to like this.

I normally have just as much general disdain for Chris as the average (?) GG fan, but in this ep I felt like Rory was just desperate to get in a little (characteristically, for her) passive-aggressive dig at him and it showed. I am by no means saying it's okay that he voluntarily missed out on her entire life up until that point. I come from a very similar upbringing to Rory's in which I was basically raised by the village that is my mother's family, and my father was never around, either. And I still don't know if I ever will have a relationship with him even though I'm a good bit past the age Rory was in this episode.

However, by this point in her life Rory has learned - and, by accepting money from him for Yale, even indirectly enabled - Chris's habit of trying to use monetary transactions to get closer to her. So when he takes her &amp; the ENTIRE Yale Daily News staff out to a notably expensive restaurant and she forces them to stiff him with the bill because of an oh-so-important story before their food even comes? All I saw in that was a big ""fuck you, Daddy Warbucks"". Idk, I just watched this ep yesterday so it's still very fresh in my mind: the tension in that scene and how it seemed to be emphasized, at least from my standpoint, that Rory knew she was rebelling against Chris's (admittedly shallow) attempt to become intimately familiar with her life, rather than being just that eager to catch some journalism clout; how Lorelai knew it as well; how the protests from the paper staff just dragged out the moment (and highlighted Rory's stubbornness) to make it all the more awkward. Chris likely spent a few hundred dollars on all that alcohol &amp; crme brule; nearly every one of her peers at the table was already plastered; and you're telling me this girl couldn't wait 15 more minutes so that everyone could at least get doggy bags before she rushed them away?! It just struck me as rude, petty, &amp; ungrateful (that's Rory for you, particularly in the latter seasons) and reeked of all the resentment Rory undoubtedly still felt about Chris weaseling his way in and eloping with her mother (which I kind of get. But still. HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS).

Maybe it's because I'm speaking from a much more humble station in life, in which I clean any plate that's gifted to me because I know there aren't too many free ones coming. But I just disliked Rory a lot in that moment. I disliked Lorelai for sitting by silently and not pushing the issue (because, hello, letting Rory be Princess Rory instead of actually acting like a parent or a genuine partner in her relationship, per her usual). I empathized with the dude with the glasses who simply did not want to die ""a crme brule virgin"" (not to mention if *I* were at that table, I would've given Rory the side-eye to end all side-eyes and kept my ass planted there until I got my VERY EXPENSIVE meal that someone else's father, seemingly graciously, paid for, to go. She was all but done as editor at that point anyway, wth could she do to me?).

It could be a hint from ASP that Rory had this HUGE opportunity to travel abroad and explore the city, WITHOUT her grandmother at certain points (which Emily was *totally* ok with) and.... she doesn't come up with any newspaper worthy story about the experience or anything that happened. Rory had an ambition to travel the world and find stories, but when time came... she basically blew it. If I recall correctly, we even see Rory freak out that she was abroad and exploded thinking she did nothing (which is *partially* true).

TL;DR: ASP warned us that Rory didn't have the *Grade A reporter* badge on her Yale girl scout uniform.",16,83,False,self,,,,,

You probably know what Im talking about. The lists on various websites about the plot holes, things that dont make sense, flaws with the main characters, the seemingly never ending complaints about how Rory didnt turn out to be Emperor of the World. 

Remember why you liked the show? Remember all the reasons the diehard fans clamored for it to return? I do. It seems like a lot of people have forgotten that the show was an escape from reality...a place we went to take a break from our real lives. It was a place where we wished we could live. 

For myself, I discovered the show when I was in high school while it was in its 4th season. I was a closeted gay kid who still hadnt figured that out yet. I had an overbearing mother who was so toxic that I ended up leaving home at 16 and whom I wanted to make sure knew nothing about my life. I related to the dynamic between Lorelai and Emily. I wished I had what Rory did with Lorelai. 

And then after catching up on the previous seasons I wished I had a Dean lol. I know a lot of people hate him but the idea of having an attractive guy who was super into you and protected you from bullies (i.e. Tristan) was rather appealing back then for me.

I wished I lived in a place like Stars Hollow where everyone seemed to support one another and know each other. But aside from the story elements that I loved which I wont ramble on about, I loved how witty and funny and original the writing was on the show. I mean, you cant find any other show that has the Gilmore girls voice. The show revolves around relationships and I think we all, in our own way, could relate to some of them on some level. 

Yeah, Rory didnt conquer the world of journalism. Guess what? I was the editor of my high school newspaper...went to school for journalism...and could not afford life on my salary at a small town newspaper. 2007 was the beginning of the end for print media. Rory entered into that field at the exact wrong time. Also, she wasnt perfect. Nobody is - doesnt make her a horrible person (character). It makes her more real. Same with Lorelai. 

Sure, we can all look back on the show that was written years and years ago, and with the benefit of hindsight, point out everything wrong with the show. But why? I dont tear apart the things I love.

So let me ask everyone...
What drew you in to the show? What made you become a fan? What were some of your favorite things that maybe are out of the mainstream?

Lorelai's ""snow story"" about her wishing for something wonderful to happen when she had an ear infection is so sweet, and sounds so real to me. The girls' tradition of taking a walk through the first snow of the season is such a cute bonding moment as well, and the writers do a great job of carrying that little tradition throughout the series.

For that matter, who starts planning someone's wedding when they haven't started planning it yet? And then they reaction when she's not pleased.

Although some part of me definitely wants them to end up together (on ep 17 of season 7), i feel like I definitely liked their relationship less as the series went on. Season 6 killed was particularly awful and I usually like it when characters have flaws but it was done so bad. I also feel as if the actor who played Luke started kinda phoning it in after season 4 and all the chemistry they originally had just disappeared once they got together. Even his personality as the show went on got more basic and kinda cringe as compared to his season one performance (calling April sweetie was so unconvincing and the scene where he brings Lorelai food at the hospital just off puts me bc of his tone of voice and I dont really know how else to explain it).

Nonetheless, Ill never say the first half of the show wasnt amazing. I finished one season every two days practically once I started. Even the end of it is pretty good, especially with Laurens performance as well as Kellys (theyre basically saving the show for me right now - as well as Kirk who is hilarious). So what Im looking for are show recommendations with that slow burn will they wont they relationship in them where the actors actually have that burning chemistry throughout the entire relationship (aka done better than GG did it after season 4).

Ok I get that girls love a bad boy and it's a plot point that finds it's way into most shows like this. But I think Jess is on a whole other level. Here's why:

The way he treats people: Jess treats people with such blatant disrespect when they're so clearly trying to help him. He talks to everyone as if they're below him  which really pisses me off.

Especially with Luke who takes Jess in and is so patient and he rarely shows any appreciation.

I understand later in life he becomes a bit more normal but still has a disrespectful and somewhat agressive streak.

Lorelai: We know how much Rory values lorelai's opinions and Lorelai is right in thinking hes a bad guy. He knows her importance in rory's life but continues to treat her horribly 

Rory: *gasp* Jess treated Rory like well nothing. He was constantly distant and moody not to mention agressive. He forced himself on her in Kyle's bedroom and basically assaulted her and then started on Dean. I saw very little in the relationship other than the physical side and they basically never talked which would've been impossible because HES NEVER THERE.

Hes as bad as Christopher. Hes all over the place and he drags Rorys emotions around like its absolutely nothing and he shows up and hes gone and he never speaks to her and he drops I love you and runs off. There seems to be no real connection. 

I understand he matures a little but after the way he treats Rory how could you want him to end up with her hes such a sh*t guy.

1. It's unlikely the family would be running around locating the clergy or florist, that's part of our crazy job reading old pre planned arrangements and finding out how to make them happen. 
2. So glad Rory wrote the obituary, she got to research and really write something personal.
Death Notice: paid, simple notice usually done with a funeral home giving service info and reception/repass/shiva following. 
Obituary: usually requested by a family or in the case of prominent death the newspaper will contact a family and write it for you or work with the family to write one. 
3. Lorelei realizing she forgot underwear the morning of the funeral is completely unreaslistic. The funeral home should have asked them to bring clothing including undergarments and shoes (shoes are optional) , and if none is provided we usually have some extra (brand new/standard undergarments like underwear, undershirts, ect) because families do forget in the chaos. Lorelei buying some and bringing it the morning of would do basically no good because the deceased is already dressed and ready for the funeral by that time. 
4. The clergy says to Lorelei ""didn't I just bury you"" when it's mentioned a few times that Trix wanted to be cremated there was no burial after the funeral service. 

All of this being said....I LOVE that they had a funeral service and cremated afterwards because so many people don't realize you can do a full service in all their glory/traditional and can cremate after (if desired). There are so many options and a good Funeral Home will be happy to help and work with you to create the service you want and to give you options.

A lot of people in this sub love Emily. That is absolutely fine, everyone loves a villain, but it'd be laughably naive to pretend that your love for Emily is because she is actually a justifiably good character, particularly in the conflict between Lorelai and Emily. Or Rory and Emily. Or hey, \*any other character\* and Emily. Instead of pretending that you love Emily because her behavior is justified, Emily fans should just admit that she's a morally reprehensible person but they like her anyway because hey, we've grown up in a world that values glamour over integrity--we value style over substance to such a profound degree that even morally bereft characters seem admirable to us when they're presented in a sharp-tongued, socially-savvy, glossy package. 

Obviously Lorelai and Rory have their faults. All characters in any work of fiction should (if the story is any good), have faults, but there's a baseline degree of character weakness that averages out to make a good person, and then there is a villain, a foil, which is precisely what Emily is meant to be. Let's recap. Emily is first and foremost a spoilt rich woman: she throws tantrums over inane things like her granddaughter's own father wanting to pay for her university tuition. These tantrums make her unlikeable, but they're nothing compared to her more ugly aspects. The most disgusting example of Emily's character comes in the form of classism. When she has dinner with Luke and Lorelai, she uses coded language to imply that Luke's value as a person is less than her own value as a human being because he isn't in her social stratosphere\*. Let that sink in for a minute. Also consider how a huge portion of our political and social problems are the result of this mindset; really contemplate how propagating this attitude is a psycho-social poison to the fabric of our society. That alone is enough to make the entire character a spoilt, villanous, and disgusting person, but on top of that, she betrays other ugly aspects of her persona throughout the series. Her first impulse, for example, when Richard quits his job out of necessity for his mental health, is to be angry. *Her immediate impulse is to value hoarding money over the love of her life's mental wellbeing*. I don't know about you, but if my partner quit his job over mental health reasons my first thought would be ""Thank god, I hope he's okay."" She thinks a young woman's virginity is her most precious aspect, or at least vaguely supports the notion enough to facilitate that kind of violent patriarchal rhetoric being espoused to a young, impressionable adult. Please remember, that in an interview, Kelly Bishop said that Emily is truly an awful person, and that she plays the character to spite and throw back into the face of women like this, how awful they really sound, and when people say that they love her and have empathy for her vulnerable side, she does not even know what they're talking about.

Despite these disgusting demonstrations of Emily's values, I honestly don't think there's anything wrong with people for liking Emily, as long as they're not naive enough to actually not realize that the reason they like her is because of the delivery of her lines, her commitment to her style, her confidence, and her showmanship. Just don't pretend that these external qualities in any way negate her pathetic sense of morals, because that would be *seriously concerning* if you did.

\~

**In defense of Lorelai, I think that Rory's feeling of being adrift in the revival is not the result of Lorelai's parenting style, but the result of Emily's interference in Rory's life.**

I actually think Lorelai's parenting style is pretty good. She supports Rory no matter what. Yes, sometimes the show jokes about Rory being the parent, but she's not actually the parent in ways that count. Trust me, I've met friends who are the parent in the family, and they did not have a life as good as Rory growing up. Lorelai may be quirky, but there is always food on the table, she's never, as far as we know, left Rory in danger, the bills are all paid without Rory having to pay them, she has her shit together enough to send her to a good private school. None of this is the sign of a family where the kid is actually a parent. That's more of a quirky joke used to point out the difference in Rory and Lorelai's personalities, as opposed to an actual reflection of Lorelai's parenting style. Rory is extremely successful as a young teenager within her academic pursuits, the moment in life when she really starts going off the rails is the point when Emily's influence in her life increases. Emily throwing the party for her to mingle with wealthy boys in Yale society, Emily enabling her to drop out of school and not even trying to get her back on track, and instead simply encouraging her to join the DAR, Emily basically gives Rory a taste of the unfulfilling, cultural wasteland of WASP life, which exists in direct contrast to the grounded, down-home, supportive, values of Lorelai, a framework within which Rory had always thrived. 

Regardless of whether you agree with me, and think that Emily and her rich-kid-for-Rory lifestyle push vs. Lorelai's parenting style is the reason for Rory's aimlessness in the revival, I think we can all agree that 30 is still young, and despite the fact that the revival is likely the last we'll see of Rory Gilmore, we can assume that there are still many adventures down the road for our young Gilmore girl.  

&amp;#x200B;

\*Many people will say that she did that out of love for Lorelai, and not thinking that any one is good enough for her. The thing is, if someone didn't want their friend to date a black person because they loved their friend and thought they ""deserved better"", that still wouldn't make them any less of a racist.",63,83,False,spoiler,,,,,

If this post is redundant and a repost I apologize. 

Does anyone else feel like rory and lorelai have a sort of weird relationship? I constantly feel like lorelai is crossing a line. The whole point of this show is to show how close a mother and daughter could be, and they are. But i always felt like lorelai was crossing certain lines. Dont get me wrong, i love how close they are, and it probably has something to do with age. Theyre only 16 years apart which may seem like a lot, but this is because lorelai got pregnant as a teenager. A lot of moms and daughters have a 25-40 year difference. 

I was watching deleted scenes the other day and [theres a scene](https://youtu.be/eiQZMZNtwxk) where a younger rory and lorelai are dancing around the room and it makes them look more like sisters than a mother and a daughter.

I grew up with GG and started rewatching again from S1 recently.

I was really struck by the dynamic of Rory and Dean's breakup in Season 1, in a way that I wasn't when I was watching the show as a teenager. I get that he says he loves her and is disappointed to not have his feelings immediately reciprocated, but when Rory tries to open up and talk about her mom and dad and  the connotations that the word ""love"" has for her he snaps back saying ""You don't get pregnant saying I love you,"" which just stood out to me as a really cruel mockery of her difficult family situation. 

With them getting back together, there's the speech at the town meeting where Rory hints that maybe she hasn't said all she wants to say. Dean drives to Chilton and is pissed at seeing Rory with Tristan (which again, I get) but he only turns around and kisses her once she says I love you. 

Does it seem to anyone else that Dean basically put Rory saying I love you as a condition of their relationship? I guess it's hard to say since we don't technically see ""the breakup"" either, just the fight leading up to it. But to me, as a 16 year old in a relationship for only THREE MONTHS, I don't think Rory was particularly cruel at that point for not saying it back right away. She's also a kid with a lot of complicated stuff going on (more so than Dean frankly) and had the right to at least have a few moments to collect her thoughts before being punished for it.

Rory had outgrown him (not that they were ever truly on the same page, I guess) and her time at his house was plain awkward with his hovering mom, sister's music, etc. Her revisiting this place where she was once really welcome, and this person who she once really liked, was just a huge uncomfortable regression - a trainwreck to watch. I feel like we've all tried to revisit a part of our past (like a hometown, old job, school or old friends) that doing so just illustrates how much you've grown and changed, for better or worse.

Even though nothing happened between him and Rory, he has to lie to his amazing girlfriend? And Rory should have told Lucy immediately. She let that weirdness go on so long. If she had just been truthful, it would not have been a big deal between her and Lucy. Rory being upset with Logan was totally wrong, and then Lorelai agrees with her! This shows how strong the Gilmore girls' communication problem is. Rory and Marty made a fool out of poor, sweet Lucy with that whole situation. 

Logan could have approached the situation with more tact than doing it at a restaurant, but by that time, the damage had been done by Rory and Marty and their lack of communication. By then, Rory had waited a long time, so not telling her immediately just makes her look guilty (which she is). Lucy probably would have had a bad reaction no matter what. Lucy asked Logan a question, and rather than lie to continue the  screwed up situation, he told her the truth. If I were Lucy, I would have wanted Logan to tell me then, rather than a third person be in on a lie designed to keep me out of the loop. 

I loved that the show introduced Lucy and Olivia for Rory, but to have this situation hanging over them just made it hard. Rory's irrational avoidance of confrontation could have cost her two great friendships. Rory had so many opportunities to tell Lucy. I am not a Logan fan, but in this case, Logan was the only one who did the right thing in this situation. It's crazy to me that Rory and Lorelai don't see that, even with hindsight. Logan shouldn't have apologized in this situation.",16,7,False,self,,,,,

Also, just from a financial standpoint, not having to buy the inn and instead having a lease in the form of smaller payments or just give portions of profits to Fran, would have been much easier on them when also having to pay for the tons of renovations, furniture, and millions of other fees involved with starting a business.",12,3,False,self,,,,,

Even so, I wish Gilmore Girls had a better concept of timing. Below are just a few examples of when I scratch my head about it:

* Rory comes back to her dorm where Lane points out she has game theory class in 15 minutes. Rory states she wanted to rest for a bit beforehand. 
   * Uh, Rory, 15 minutes before the class is basically enough time to get to class, not go back to your dorm, rest and then go to class. What do you expect to get, a 5-minute nap? If I remember right, she does this a few times.
* The five-minute conversations at Chilton lunches from the time they sit down to the bell ringing. 
   * No lunch in the history of ever is that short at school. 
* Rory and Dean have breakfast before school at Luke's. They have that conversation about Rory eyeing Dean's breakfast, and they trade. Right after they trade plates, Lorelai comes in and they leave for school because it took her 30 minutes to come inside. 
   * One of my pet peeves with the show is watching them order food but barely eat it before leaving. I see this mostly happening at Luke's. 
* Rory is in Europe with Emily, and she mails Lorelai Dean's letter to deliver to him for her. Lorelai delivers it either the day Rory comes home or the day before she does. This one is hard to tell because during Luke's phone call to Lorelai on the day she delivers the letter, he says he'll see Lorelai later that day, and she doesn't see Luke until after Rory comes home. I say it's hard to tell because Lorelai wears two different outfits from the time she talks to Luke/delivers the letter to when she sees Luke and Rory. 
   * Either way, if Rory's arrival home was that quick to Lorelai getting the letter, Rory could've delivered it to Dean herself. Granted, I think the saving argument here could be that mail from Europe took longer than expected, so it just worked out that Lorelai got it around the time Rory came home. 

If you've noticed issues like this, let me know! I know this isn't that great of a ""hey, notice this!"" but I've watched the show for so very long.

He was in Philly for Keystone Comicon and he visited his hometown- was honored by the Mayor and spoke, answered questions and met many of his fans. 

 I wanted to share some of the things that Scott talked about during his visit, because I thought you might find his answers interesting. Scott spent a lot of the time he was with us answering the crowd's questions (and even after he said ""just one more"" several times- he went on to answer almost two dozen more questions). 

He came across as a down to earth, really GENUINE guy, (very sweet and humble). After the public ceremony- he stuck around, shook hands and said hello to about 50 people who took the time to stay and meet him. It was really kind of him to give so much time to his hometown- he's clearly VERY appreciative of his fame and the love he has for Gilmore fans. Then he took a walk around the down town area with the Mayor and some fans who decided to go with. 

So here are his answers to most of the public's questions);

- His favorite episode of GG has always been the pilot- and his favorite season was the 1st season ""because that's when the magic started- and that's when the limos first started showing up at the house and whisking me places.""

- He avoided answering any questions about Rory's baby daddy (Repeatedly joking that it was clearly Mike Tyson), and only when he was finally asked ""Of all her boyfriends, who was your favorite/least favorite""- he said that Jess (probably) because of course, he had ties to those scenes. 

- He tried to avoid answering who his least favorite character in the series was; turning it back on the girl who asked the question. When she laughed and answered ""Dean""- he came down out of the Gazebo, laughing, and shook her hand, saying it was a great question AND an equally great answer. 

- He admitted to NEVER ACTUALLY WATCHING the revival. He said that he only saw Winter, because it was aired at the release party. He said that he heard about all the dissapointed fans after the fact and that he was pretty bummed about it, and had put off watching it... And that because it seemed like the dissapointment only got WORSE as time went on... He never actually watched the last three episodes. He said that he felt that the Revival ""crashed and burned"" and that it was ""horrible""... 

- He went on to say that he felt that they SHOULD have done a 4 episode arc about the lead up to the wedding between Luke and Lorelai, the actual wedding, and then after the wedding... And that was it. He said it was what the fans wanted and that he fought for it and was very dissatisfied with what we got. He also said he was still open to doing something along those lines (but-sidenote from me here- that's pretty upsetting since clearly the series ended in a way that wouldn't really allow us to NOW film something separate about the wedding... As far as the series ended- it very much felt like the wedding was over and done with.) 

-He said that he was very open to doing more Gilmore in the future, but that ASP is ""winning all the awards"" for Miss Miesel that she never got for GG, and so there's pretty much no way it's happening. He said that he's suggested multiple times that they DO more, but that he doesn't think it'll happen. He also unequivocally stated that the series ended ""because the two girls just didn't want to do it anymore"". So if there was ever a question- it definitely sounds like Lauren and Alexis were just DONE by the time the series ended. 


- He was asked about his band and his music and said that as much as he enjoys it, and although he has quite a few songs he'd been working on, He mentioned that he's really not doing anything much with his music right now because his coffee business ""really took off"" and has totally taken over his life and become a ""full time gig"". 

-When asked if he was still acting, he said that he does have some more acting projects going on as well but that he couldn't talk about any of them yet- so STAY TUNED!  He said we'd see him in something else ""really soon"", and to check him out on social media because he posts about what he's doing as soon as he's allowed to. 

-He raved about his growing up in South Jersey and all the opportunities that growing up here gave him. He raved about the great education that he got here &amp; talked a LOT about his memories as a kid and young adult here. There were quite a few people in the crowd; including his old next door neighbors, his little league coach's son (who was on his team), several kids he grew up with, went to high school with, his old babysitter was there, and he talked about the family next door (the entire family showed up) and how he went to the Poconos with them because the dad, a local vet, would take him out of school when it snowed to go skiing when he was in grade school.  He had a ton of great things to say about South Jersey and said that he really wanted to raise his son here and was trying to talk ""the wife"" into it because she's a ""California girl all the way"". 

- He said when he went ""down the shore"" it was to Cape May, and Sea Isle City. (And that back then, Wildwood just ""wasn't thier thing""). 

-He said he got into acting after he was traveling the world after high school, and spent some time on a small island in Italy, where there's a US submarine base. He met a couple there who took him in, and were very kind to him- and when he got back to the US, The man enrolled him in his acting classes... And it all went from there. He suggested that others who want to get into the business go the ""classy route""- get a degree from a solid college (he mentioned NorthWestern, Julliard, etc)- and then to get on stage through New York - off Broadway, Broadway, etc- because from there, you can go into theatre, film, tv, etc- and that ""LA and the business out there is all political and isn't about talent- it's a whole different beast and if you don't know someone who knows someone... Not to bother.

-He said that he has two storage units and that he has almost ""all of Luke's diner"" in one of them. He said that he slowly but surely took home just about everything once he realized the show was ending... From his clothing, hats, mugs, diner menus- you name it. He offered to sell someone in the crowd the chair from Luke's Diner that he'd snuck off set in his trunk (and he joked that once they started checking the cast and crew to be sure they weren't taking ""souvenirs""- that he'd just slip security a $20 and leave with his car packed full off stuff... He started listing all the stuff he had before joking ""I have it all. For real. The whole diner more or less. I have everything."" 

- He said that his favorite regular cast to work with was Sean Gunn and Melissa McCarthy because they both have similar acting styles to his... Which is that his first re-take is as good as it's going to get, after that he starts getting bored and impatient. He said they were often given NO notes except ""Faster""

- He said that his favorite memory of working with Ed Herrman was on the golf course,thier first scene together. He called him ""the ultimate professional"" and said that he really enjoyed every moment they worked together and that it was a true loss to both the series and the entire world to have lost him. 

- He said that he stays in touch with everyone - that they don't talk regularly, like every week- but that they do all get in touch via text (usually) but that its pretty common for them to call or text and congratulate each other when something is going on- and that they all genuinely liked each other and got along, especially by the revival. 

- He agreed that there was some tension with Lauren especially early on... Professional disagreements about how to handle some scenes- but that often times that conflict translated into the chemistry that showed on screen. He said that he and Lauren always respected each other, that they did laugh and joke and that the extent of thier ""disagreements"" were about the actual ACTING within the scenes- and that often times they worked them out amongst themselves- often trying his ideas, then hers (or vice versa) and that neither of them won ""more than the other""- so it continued to happen for several seasons. Eventually, they got along better- but because there genuinely was never any ACTUAL sexual flirtation OFF SCREEN, that it led to great on-screem tension. He said that the way acting teachers and directors can tell if a couple is sleeping together is that thier scenes fall completely flat and the tension is gone- and then laughed off ""And so that's why I never slept with Lauren... You know, to keep the integrity of our chemistry on screen."" (He was VERY clearly joking and did not at all come across as mysogonistic- I just want to stress that.)

-He said that he was most like his character in that he's extremely laid back and that neither of them suffers fools gladly...  (and said that while ASP seemed to think that was a Connecticut thing- that his character was basically sold to him as a South Jersey type person and that's why he slid into the character so comfortably.) He said that unlike Luke, he likes to laugh and he doesn't feel nearly as strongly about junk food and cell phones. 

- He said that Michael Winters (Taylor Doose) was a great guy and that they loved working together because thier scenes were always hilarious and that he had a hard time acting like he hated the guy because in reality, they got along great and that he's ""a super great guy"". 

- He said his least favorite scene ever was the scene where Lorelei proposed to him... And that he hated it. He hated the idea, the execution and the way the scene played out. He said that he argued (repeatedly) and that he genuinely was very upset about the whole thing- he didn't feel it was a good scene, he didn't feel it was a good thing to do within the context of the show- and that he hated how it ended up.

- He was asked about how it was to be on an episode of Seinfeld...  He answered that he was shocked one day when he got a call asking to see if he could meet with Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David the next day, and he did- and to his surprise, they decided to cast him... Someone young asked ""who he played on the show""- and a woman in the crowd yelled out ""He was sponge worthy!!"" - without missing a beat- almost twenty women nearby yelled out ""He still is!!"" &amp; he blushed SO hard. It was hilarious hearing him try to describe the episode that he was in... Telling the kids to ""cover thier ears"" as he described Elaine deaming him ""sponge worthy"" after her favorite birth control was pulled from the market and became hard to get. He was very cute about the whole thing. 

-When asked about his ""favorite traditions or memories during his time at Haddonfield high school""- he answered that he and his buddy used to take loooooong showers after baseball practice. He laughed and told how they'd drag two folding chairs into the showers after baseball, and theyd just sit and talk for HOURS until the water went cold ""Solving the world's problems and shooting the shit about everything and anything""- and then to sum up he said ""So yeah -Showering with my buddy over there (pointing him out in the crowd) was my best high school memory""- his buddy was indeed there in the crowd. He was SO EMBARRASSED but it was a HILARIOUS story. 

- He pushed everyone to check out Scotty P's big mug coffee (on Amazon) and expressed interest in opening an actual coffee shop here in Haddonfield. After a coffee shop owner in Haddonfield lamented that they hadn't held one of the pop-up coffee shops here in his hometown- he told her they would ""talk business"" and that he'd love to work with her to bring his coffee to town and that he'd love to be involved. 

Oh, and...Last thing (I swear);  He got asked to choose between Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen... To which he said ""Oh no... No way!"" (Laughing) ""That's a trap- there's no way I'm answering that one...  I am not that dumb, my friend. There's no way I'm stepping on that land mine!"" - He went on to say that of course, they are both FANTASTIC and raved about both musicians, thier early albums especially, and thier importance to NJ. 

He took the time after the ceremony to say Hi and &amp; thanks to the many people who came to see him- and to hug a ton of the fans and old friends that hung out (myself included). It was A GREAT night and I genuinely am glad I could share a little bit of his visit to NJ with all of you all!! 

So that's it! Now you can all feel like you were there!
So much love!!!!

A while ago i started watching gilmore girls over my morning de-caff and i think it was one of the best decisions i ever made.
I start off my day in beautiful Stars Hollow and Rory's motivation to study and overcome her personal problems really helps me feel positive and grateful for all that i have:) 
I move on to my usual tasks like cleaning my room or studying with her in mind thinking to myself ""Rory can go from zero to studying in 0.2 seconds"" or ""Rory's stars hollow bedroom is so lovely"" or that she tends to deal with her boy troubles very well.
I know it must sound really odd but honestly it's really important to me that i find a way to enjoy and see the positive in even the smallest of my daily tasks and gilmore girls really helps with feeling like life can be a fun interesting adventure.

Was a sporadic casual watcher when it first came out.

Im almost done with Season 4 and I cant tell if I love it or hate it.

First of all, theres a dramatic shift in humor content - more crude, sexual in nature, lots of fat jokes, body digs, gay jokes, internet cracks, etc. I get it (written early 00s, Rory is older so dialogue is more mature, blah blah blah) but Im still annoyed by the cheapness. Lame.

Second, theres a disconnect between Lorelai and Rory and Im anxious to get back to normal with them.

Dragonfly, Davey, Digger, Gil... so many strange storylines.

Dean, Jess, Lane... so many old favorites losing their charm (for me). Im either bored or annoyed with most of the regular characters.

Emily though  This is by far my favorite season for her character. Im also enjoying Paris progression.

Curious- did anyone else have a shift in interest/likability around Season 4? Should I take a break from binge watching and revisit later? Am I just more invested in the characters now so I care more? Does this series jump the shark or does it get better and this season is just a growing pain that Ill appreciate later?

Was there anything more than sexual attraction and pressure?

In season one, we see how lorelai goes up to max in the streets and right away invites him back to her place. When theyre outside lorelai also immediately implies that shes dated and had sex since giving birth to rory, just not in her own house. once theyre inside, lorelai and max are making out while walking up the stairs and are *probably* gonna have sex when they get upstairs (the only reason they dont is because of lane). 

Lorelai seems to keep making excuses that she doesnt want to be with max, but ultimately it all just seemed that she just didnt like him. Like how she said that she was getting uncomfortable with rory snd max getting close, but rory was completely fine. 

Around the end of season 1, lorelai hooks up with max right after meeting up with him just once and tries to let him know that she probably wont call him again.

I honestly think she only accepted the engagement out of pressure. It does seem weird and immature to get engaged out of pressure  but if someone got you 1,000 flowers it would be pretty hard to say no. And after all, she didnt get married out of pressure, just engaged. To me it just seems like her whole relationship with max was one sided. Max was in love, and lorelai just seemed smitten by the proposal and fueled by sexual attraction and pressure.",7,1,False,self,,,,,
