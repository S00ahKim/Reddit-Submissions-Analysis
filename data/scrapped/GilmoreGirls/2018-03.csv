But they do make sense if you age the characters down 8 years or so. It makes sense for Rory to have no idea how to handle a career slump if she is in her 20s, and has had jobs and success fall into her lap. It doesn't make sense though while she is 10 years into her career. Same with her relationships. She doesn't know how to handle her first ""adult"" relationship with Paul, so she just ignores it and falls back on the familiar, aka Logan. A ""quarter life crisis"" is far more believable and acceptable than Rory just being a shitty adult. 

It makes sense for a mid to late 20s Logan to be letting his family's desires run his life. But a man looking down the barrel at 40 would definitely not marry some woman for his parents sake. 

Same with Lorelei and Luke. Ten years into a stable, cohabiting life together, you have had the kids talk, etc... But two successful adults who already have kids, might just be be at the point of thinking about kids and marriage a few years into it. 

Paris freaking out at an alumni event? Jess still maybe having leftover feelings? And hell, the 30 Something Gang makes more sense as 20 Somethings. I've known 30 year olds who move back home. They don't have ""support groups"", they buckle down and try like hell to get out of the slump. 

Obviously there are still a lot of issues with the revival, but subtract a few years and suddenly the characters we love make a lot more sense.

Hi, folks. I have a question I can't seem to find an answer to. In the episode previous the one I'm inquiring, Rory choose Yale. In the next episode (Lorelai's birthday) Richard gives Lorelai the 75,000 check, an investment he made in her name at her birth. Did he give her the check knowing it would hurt their financial aid? I ask because later in the episode, or perhaps it was the next, the check is the only reason Rory didn't get financial aid. 

So, that's my question: Did Richard deliberately foil the financial aid so he and Emily could continue paying for Rory's education, therefore keeping Rory and thus, Lorelai, in their lives?",16,9,False,self,,,,,

(https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/80r6nb/favorite_season_two_episode/)  The link for anyone who still needs to vote.

*The Bracebridge Dinner* is the runaway winner.  Mentioned on almost 2/3 of the ballots and almost as many 1st place votes as 2nd and 3rd combined.  In 2nd place was *I Can't Get Started*.  Picked on even more ballots than Bracebridge but couldn't overcome all the first place votes Bracebridge got. 

3rd-6th is still very, very close.  As of Friday, *A-Tisket, A-Tasket* is just beating out *The Road Trip to Harvard* for 3rd place.  Harvard didn't get as many votes as others but the votes it did get were very high up.  *Lorelai's Graduation Day* and *There's The Rub* are just one point back (and tied with each other).  Since it is so close I will keep in open in case anyone didn't vote yet and update any more voters we get.  

***Complete Results***

1. The Bracebridge Dinner (7,2,3,1,0) = 54 pts
2. I Can't Get Started (4,2,2,3,3) = 43 pts
3. A-Tisket, A-Tasket (1,2,4,2,2) = 31 pts
4. The Road Trip To Harvard (4,2,0,0,0) = 29 pts
5. Lorelai's Graduation Day (1,2,1,5,1) = 28 pts
6. There's The Rub (1,2,3,2,2) = 28 pts
7. Like Mother, Like Daughter (one 1st) = 18 pts
8. Dead Uncles and Vegetables (one 1st) and Presenting Lorelai Gilmore (one 1st) = 17 pts
10. Help Wanted and Teach Me Tonight = 14 pts
12. Red Night On The Wedding Night (one 1st) = 13 pts
13. Lost and Found = 11 pts
14.  It Should Have Been Lorelai = 9 pts
15. The Ins and Outs Of Inns (one 1st) = 5 pts
16. Back In The Saddle Again = 4 pts
17.  Nick and Nora / Sid and Nancy and Hammer and Veils = 3 pts (most surprising to me. I expected N&amp;N/S&amp;N to be higher).
19. Richard is Stars Hollow, Secrets and Loans, Run Away, Little Boy = 1 pts.

Only *Sadie, Sadie* failed to get picked by anyone.

Rory was 16 and had never had a boyfriend before. We know that Dean was in a relationship before he moved to Stars Hollow. So when Dean tells her he loves her after only 3 months, and she didn't say anything back, what is the problem? It's her first ever boyfriend, how on earth is she supposed know she's in love after just 3 months? If they had been dating for a year and she still hadn't said it then sure he had every right to be angry and break up with her, because after a year if she didn't love him what was the point? But to break up with her then it just really shows what a dick he is.

To be honest a lot of their relationship annoys me. I'm sure he knew he was her first boyfriend so when Lorelai, who is basically her mum and dad until Christopher shows up and after really, gives him 'the talk' and he gets lippy back to her I just think he's so rude! Don't get me wrong it isn't nice when someone just assumes that you're not gonna treat their daughter right and whatever but this is Rory's first relationship! Of course Lorelai is going to be protective! Especially as she is a single parent and Rory is all she has! Even if he didn't like the talk he should have just sat there and took it!

He feels guilty and wants to make one of his big gestures to make it up for it. Maybe he expects to keep connected to her somehow through the house? I honestly dont know.

From trying to beat up Dean after he dumped Rory, to THREATENING to beat up Logan at Emily &amp; Richard's vow renewal, to *that* V-Day episode, it comes across like Luke has reallyyy drunk the Koolaid on this whole ""Rory is an innocent little girl whose honor must always be defended"" thing. I have my own theories about why he is this way that go beyond ""everyone in Stars Hollow is like this &amp; he just sees Rory as a daughter"", but suffice it to say that sometimes I think the only thing Luke &amp; Lorelai have in common is their often overboard preoccupation with Rory's love life. And that the only time I think he believed - or wanted to believe - anyone was good enough for Rory was when she was dating Jess, who is of course his nephew &amp; kind of a younger, ""badder"" version of himself, so that sort of is justified...sort of.

So without just making this a sounding board for my own thoughts (to start, lol) what do ya'll think? Is Luke creepy or just caring? He sees Rory as a daughter...but does Luke see Luke as a father figure, &amp; should she? And what about April - she's in college in the revival (&amp; I haven't watched it in over a year) but from what we see, do you believe Luke ever got as up in her, his own biological daughter's, social/romantic business as he did Rory's?

**Keg! Max!** - With graduation approaching, Rory (Alexis Bledel) is happily looking forward to attending the Stars Hollow High School prom with Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), but he gets some surprising news from the principal (guest star Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, ""Welcome Back, Kotter""). Lane's (Keiko Agena) band makes its debut at a big party, but the evening ends on an ugly note when the long-standing animosity between Jess and Dean (Jared Padalecki) finally erupts into a fist fight. Meanwhile, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) gets roped into serving on the parents' committee for the Chilton graduation party, putting her back in contact with a very uncomfortable Max Medina (Scott Cohen).

In what I would consider an upset, *The Big One* took first place for season 3.  (I think u/jbs2725's passionate argument for it is the reason why people remembered what a great episode it was).

2nd and 3rd was neck and neck between the pre-vote favorites.  In the end, *They Shoot Gilmore's, Don't They?* edged out *Those are Strings, Pinocchio* by a single point.  *They Shoot Gilmores* received the most 1st place votes with 5 for the whole season.

*A Tale Of Poes and Fire* was 4th and *A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving* and *Dear Richard and Emily* were tied for 5th (with Deep Fried getting more votes but Dear Richard getting more first and second place votes).  After the top 6, there is a pretty sizable drop off.

***Complete Results***

1. The Big One (2,4,5,3,0) = 47
2. They Shoot Gilmores (5,2,1,1,3) = 41
3. Those Are Strings (4,3,1,2,1) = 40
4. A Tale Of Poe and Fire (2,3,1,1,0) = 27
5. A Deep Fried Korea Thanksgiving (1,2,2,3,1) = 26
6. Dear Richard and Emily (2,3,1,0,1) = 26
7. Let The Games Begin = 14
8. Take the Deviled Eggs = 13
9. Keg! Max! = 8
10. Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days = 6
11. Application Anxiety = 5
12. That'll Do Pig and One's Got Class and The Other One Dyes = 4
13. Happy Birthday Baby = 2
14. Swan Song, Lorelai Out Of Water, Haunted Leg = 1
15. 8 o'clock at the Oasis, I Solemnly Swear, Face-Off, Say Goodnight, Gracie, Here Comes The Son = no votes

And now, time for Season Four!. Same rules as before. The five episodes worked much better I think so we will keep that.

Seriously? Having kids carry their stuff for them? They've always been ""princesses"" (well, honestly Lor more than Rory) but they've both historically been hard-workers. It's just NOT them. 

I'm not going to discuss Rory's cheating too much because honestly, she did it in the original and it's just a character flaw. Lor's indifference is a little surprising... With Dean, she was so upset because Dean was married... But she would feel betrayed if Luke cheated on her so it makes no sense that she's so chill about Rory sleeping with engaged Logan. At least she does say it's ""slutty"". However, it feels unrealistic that Logan would be down for cheating with Rory. He's always been pretty straightforward. He is who he is. He was a player, but being with Rory really changed him. He was ready to commit. He's a smart guy and has always had good boundaries (unlike the Gilmore girls). I just don't see him carrying on in this affair with such indifference. He loves Rory. It would be all or nothing, I feel like, given the changes we saw in his personality in the later seasons. 

I wish she didn't turn out the way she did but she's a mixture of Lorelai and Emily. She is immature and impulsive like Lor but has the entitlement and disregard for others (and expensive taste) like Emily. None of the Gilmore girls are particularly emotionally intelligent but Rory puts Lorelai to shame in that department (more like Emily, I suppose). She's not the kind, responsible, passionate, and likeable kid she was in the first several seasons, which sucks. I think if she had stayed away from her grandparent's lifestyle, she'd be more responsible, down-to-earth, and kind (like Lorelai) but then, she may not have gotten into Yale (without Chilton and Richard and Emily's connections). Then again, would she be happier now if she'd worked her way up the ladder with her intelligence and love for learning she had as a teen? I think it's very likely. 

Can we talk about how Alexis Bledel is not a good actress in this? In the original series, she was monotone but it was just Rory. Has she lost whatever acting skills she did have in the last 10 years or is it just me? And OMG Raechel Ray- it was so bad. She was talking with her hands the entire time- it was cringey to say the least. 

I appreciated the continued dysfunction with Emily. She's so unforgiving and mean, as she always has been. She is so mentally ill and yet, I truly love her. She hurts the people she loves so much (true to her character), but she's realistically broken. 

Paris was great. I was saddened that she and Doyle were splitting up. I can't say it was unrealistic, because divorce is so common, of course... But still, they really did seem to love each other deeply. It didn't feel like infatuation with them, especially in season 7, when Paris felt compelled to end the relationship because she wanted to choose grad school unbias. I don't know. Still, I liked it. I was sad that she was repeating patterns of her disengaged parents with her own kids but again, realistic. 

I think we can all agree that the never-ending play was a shitshow. I honestly feel like ASP had something she wanted to communicate with us but I just DON'T get it. And why did the rest of the committee like the play? Since when are the townspeople complete morons (besides Taylor)? Such a waste of precious revival screen time. 

And Babette and Miss Patty were colder, right? Like not warm and light and cheery at all. 

A lot of things just didn't have the same lightness that they did in the original series. There's so much I had a problem with in every episode. And GG is my all-time favorite show. It was fun but I was ultimately so disappointed. 

Wish we saw more of Lane and they didn't just throw her dad in there with absolutely zero explanation.

Personally, I really liked the fight between Rory and Lorelai in Raincoats and Recipes. Neither of them raise their voices all that much, but from that moment on there is something that breaks (almost irreparably) between the two of them. 

Another one I liked was Luke and Jess in Say Goodnight, Gracie where Jess confronts Luke about hiding Jimmy from him and confesses that he is not graduating. The way Luke is in denial at first and then tells him that he is going to school and live in the diner for one more year all the while Jess firmly shakes his head is great acting.

When I first watched, I HATED April and Anna. Obviously anything getting in the way of L&amp;L was awful (I seriously cannot stand Emily) because OTP. And let me preface this with they honestly could have done ANYTHING else for drama with those two to keep it interesting and not have them completely break up, but after a rewatch, I have changed my tune to just Anna being the worst. April is just a kid (although, she pulls a move I want to smack her for. I'll discuss later). Anna is completely irrational about everything that has to do with April once Luke comes on the scene. The birthday party was INSANE. Like, there's no way that group of girls called to ask to sleep over at some strange person's diner (because I doubt every.single.parent knew Luke) and didn't get a chaperone count. 
Now, my thought process is that Luke, while being a serial monogamist, was never the marrying kind. They always talked about how hung up on Rachel he was, but there was never mention of how close those two were other than Luke being devastated when she bolted. Now, enter Lorelei. I honestly think had he asked her out when he was first interested, it probably wouldn't have lasted. Simply because of where they both were in their lives. So he held on. And his love grew and grew and my GAWD did it grow. Now, enter Anna. She hears about this guy that never came off as a family man or the settling down type. And he's engaged. I think Anna is livid for one, at herself for never giving Luke the chance to make right. For two, she's mad that Luke is able to take on the role so....I don't want to say smoothly because omg he's so adorably embarrassing about SO much...so well. I think she's mad that she doesn't have that part of Luke and that maybe she should have told him or tried or SOMETHING because ignoring the fact that he is April's father, she still loves him. We don't know why they broke up, or who initiated it so we're kinda left guessing. 
Now April. Okay, so the ENTIRE time April is around, our bumbling idiot will NOT introduce her to Lorelei. This is the one story line I CANNOT get behind because it just makes me so, so angry. And honestly I feel it's VERY OOC for him to be like, no you can't meet my kid, it's too soon. Because those aren't his words. He was terrified, but the look on his face when he sees that Lorelei switched the birthday gifts, well, I think BOTH L&amp;L needed some one on one conversation time to lay everything out before Lorelei emotionally vomited on him in the middle of the street. Once Anna has to leave, she automatically trusts Luke (oh, imagine that. He's suddenly single and NOW April can have a sleepover? Now Luke is trustworthy? Passive aggressive psychopath) but the second April gets into the apartment, suddenly she's like ""ohh....you need some candles and maybe you can bring someone home"". Like omg. Did you NOT meet his fiance and like her?! I feel like Anna had a MAJOR hand in that. Not that she outright suggested it to April, but April is a smart girl and kids pick up on A LOT more than adults would like to admit. It just sucked all around. He didn't handle the situation well. AT ALL. Neither did Lorelei. I know she wanted to give him space, but she still should have told him her feelings instead of just throwing them at him. But Anna knew what she was doing and I'm sure it didn't go unnoticed, and I'm sure she was doing the ""I told you so"" dance after they broke up because of the conversation she had with Lorelei ""engaged isn't married"". And omg I'm sorry but if I was a single parent and dating, I would NOT wait until we were married to introduce them together. That's just absurd and makes ZERO sense. 

Apologies. I had to get this out. 5 years of ""will they/won't they"" and BAM, that crazy ruined it all. Rips out my heart",51,46,False,self,,,,,

He would get so angry and sometimes violent or threaten violence at the very least that even Rory looked afraid of him at times.  The examples I can think of are:
1)Rory's Dance.  He got in Tristan's face and threatened to kill him. Granted Tristan obviously had a crush on Rory and was jealous to see her with Dean and he wasn't the nicest kid but he didn't do anything to deserve to have Dean threaten to kill him. In a later episode he makes a crack about Tristan being strangled with a Doose's market apron.
2) He gets mad at Rory because she doesn't say I love you back.
3) He yells at Rory in the episode where Jess brought her food while Lorelai was at the spa.  He got so angry that Rory looked scared and Paris intervened with her lie about having a crush on Jess to get Dean to calm down.
4) He hauls off and punches Jess just because he says Rory crying and Jess is behind her.  He has no idea why she is crying or that Jess even did anything but he just punches Jess anyway.
5)He yells at Lindsay for answering his cell phone.  This could partly be due to his guilt about cheating but he was so cruel to her and she looked so scared and confused I felt bad for her.
Not to mention he used to hang in trees outside their house all the time according to Lorelai and he calls Rory 12-15 times a day which is very excessive.  It is clear he has issues and there are red flags about him but no one is concerned and Lorelai acts like it's cute.  She also doesn't notice when Rory feels scared or uncomfortable with Dean.

In my opinion so many things in the show are based on an idea of motherhood that I dont share. I will explain. The whole premise of GG is that Lorelai getting pregnant is what gives her the strength to break up with her own dynastic plan. And Rory getting pregnant is what is going to give her the impulse to find herself, focus etc. 

Ok, Im a mom, and in my experience its just exactly the opposite. I know GG is fiction, is kind of a fairytale and Im ok with that, I love it because of that. But in the real world Lorelai would have break up with her parents a lot easier without a baby. When you have a baby your life choices are limited. You cant live everywhere, you cant work that easily because your time is limited. You need people, you need certain living standards, you need money, you need a support system that, usually, is your mother, your brother/sisters, your partner (not everyone is going to be with you at 3 oclock in the morning while your baby cries night after night). So you become more conservative, you need more stability, you dont have the strength to change many things (you are sleep deprived, for once). You are not free anymore. If you breastfeed on demand you have your baby literally glued to your body for many months.  

And a baby doesnt solve any problems, it creates others. Usually you dont run away from your mom, you get closer, you reconnect with her. Its difficult to explain, its pure instinct. 

This is what I have observed among my friends and myself, its my experience, but Im sure its different for others. I think we dont only idealize bad boys, we idealize motherhood also. And its intense and incredible and great and you love that little thing more than anything in the world but its also very very hard. It holds you back in a way (definitely in your job, also with your partner), at least for the first 3 years, it doesnt generally make you move forward. Its pure biology. You are pregnant, you make a nest, a safe one, and you stay. 
 

And if you want to be there for your baby (and we are told that thats what Lorelai did) you usually renounce to some of your independence because you need your parents or your partner to provide while you take care of the baby. Either you keep your independence and you cant be there for your kid all the time (which I totally respect) or you are 100% there for your kid but you depend on someone, also completely respectful option. Theres not I rejects my parents, Im 16 years old, I will work in a hotel as a maid but I will always be there for my kid. Its either one thing or the other, thats why its so difficult for women to have it all unfortunately.

Not because she became an adulterer and ""homewrecker"" who ruined a marriage. Not because this destroyed her character, she lost all of her integrity, blah, blah blah. No. I hated this story line because of how she was treated afterwards, not just by the Stars Hallow community, but by fans of the show.

Why did so many fans write angry blog posts calling Rory a homewrecker, but didn't direct even half of their anger towards Dean, the actual homewrecker? Dean was the one in a monogamous relationship. Dean was the one who chose to cheat on his wife. Dean is the one responsible for the breakdown of his relationship. Why then, does everyone, blame Rory? Why, in the 21st century, are we still blaming the other woman? 

Let me be clear, knowingly sleeping with someone in a monogamous relationship is ethically dubious. But this arc isn't unique to Gilmore Girls. From the Anniston/Jolie feud to the plot of pretty much every daytime soap opera, women get blamed for the menfolk's infidelity. In our cultural subconscious, we still think of women as the ones who ""tempt"" men, who are powerless against their sexual urges. And it isn't necessarily a sexist thing -- how many men direct their anger and even violence towards the 'other man' upon discovering that their girlfriend or wife is having an affair? 

Look, it's natural to want to blame the other man or woman. When you feel hurt and betrayed by someone you love, it's easier to blame a third party than to accept that your partner chose to cheat on you. But that's exactly what happened. If person A and B are in a monogamous relationship and B decided to have an affair with C, C is not at fault! C didn't promise anything to A or B. C doesn't owe anything to A or B. The third party is completely irrelevant. The *only* person at fault is B, the one who broke his or her promise. 

For a show that has always been praised for its feminist merits, this feels like a step backwards. ",54,25,False,self,,,,,

**FromS5E7:**

*LORELAI: Yeah, and I wasn't hiding it. The only reason I reacted to Kirk the way that I did is that he's not in this world, he's in my other world. It's as if I, out of the blue, told you I was having tea with Mrs. Van Uppity.*

*EMILY: Who?*

*LORELAI: Hortence Van Uppity, tight bun, lace collar, tiny poodle... fictional friend?*

*EMILY: You keep so much from me with these separate worlds of yours. It's not right.*

*LORELAI: I will try harder to merge the worlds. I promise.*

**From S5E13:**

*LORELAI: Rory, this is how it works in my parents' world. Trust me, the Sheldrakes are busy screwing someone at the Bluestone out of something as we speak.*

*RORY: If you say so.*

*LORELAI: These people live in a universe where they feel entitled to get what they want, when they want it, and they don't care who's in their way. I hate that world. Vapid. Selfish. It's like that Life and Death Brigade you wrote about.*

*RORY: What do you mean?*

*LORELAI: You know, like a bunch of selfish rich kids, the children of entitlement, blowing off school. Drinking for days. Spending thousands on a stupid and potentially dangerous stunt, knowing full well that they're not going to get in trouble, 'cause Daddy is important. They're all the same.*

*RORY: They're not all the same. You don't even know them. And that's not what I wrote. I didn't say all those things about them. You're just reading whatever you want to into it.*

---------------------

**My question is this: What do you think was the purpose behind that?**

Here's the thing: The Palladinos set up this premise - supported solely by lead character Lorelai's expressed beliefs and opinions - that the ""Gilmores world"" was vapid, selfish, incapable of real commitment. They reinforced it time and time again. As early as S1E3: Kill Me Now - Rory's outing to the club - she overhears and sees things supporting her mother's views. Later, when she's with the bridesmaids and the members of the LDB, she further sees/hears things that support Lorelai's assertions. 

BUT, then they show how things are not so different in Stars Hollow.  We have megalomaniac Taylor who certainly feels entitled to get whatever he wants and does whatever he needs to to ensure it happens.  Miss Patty has been busy getting busy, going through multiple marriages. Ditto for Luke's sister Liz. Liz's friends (most evidenced Carrie) have an interesting perspective on monogamy. Despite their marital vows, Nicole cheats on Luke, Dean cheats on Lindsay. We hear of other tales of infidelity in Stars Hollow - Art Brush, Fay Wellington and Margie, the fudge queen. Jerry Cutler who dumped his 35 year old wife for ""that tramp"" Annabelle who turned out to be a year older than the ex-wife. Etc, etc. 

My question is two-fold:

(1) Given what is portrayed on the show, do you perceive any validity to the assertion that the motivations of those within the ""Gilmores' world"" are any more morally suspect than those in the Stars Hollow world?  Simply put, are the folks in Stars Hollow inherently ""better""? 

(2) What do you think the purpose of the two worlds construct was? Keeping in mind, it very much centers around Lorelai. Regardless of how true (or not) it was, Lorelai seemed heavily invested in believing it to be an incontrovertible truth.  Did she hold onto it as a mantra to justify her actions over the years?

I bawled when the show ended (I was 14, leave me alone).  I waited basically 10 years for them to bring the show back in some way, shape, or form.  I **hated** AYITL.  I feel like the only people who enjoyed the reboot were newer fans of Gilmore Girls, and I'm interested to prove (or disprove) my theory.

IMO:

- There was no reason for the special to be 4 90 minute long episodes.  It could have been consolidated waaaaay down.

- Piggybacking off of this, I felt that so much of the special was just filler, and don't even get me started on the Sutton Foster musical extravaganza.  Broadway is my next greatest love after GG, and I couldn't even stomach this.

- I feel like they started destroying the character/integrity of Rory Gilmore in like season 5, but they went WAY overboard with this in AYITL.  As someone who looked up to Rory when I first started watching the show when I was 11 or 12, this was disheartening.  She went from a fantastic role model to a hot mess.

- Speaking of being a hot mess, didn't this chick have goals and aspirations??? What happened??? How did Rory friggin' Gilmore not have a career at 32 years old??? Didn't the series end with her following the Obama campaign?  The dude won, you would've thought the girl made some connections.  I mean, I know that people go through a weird limbo phase when they're trying to figure out what to do with their lives... I'm currently headed into my quarter-life crisis myself... but this was **not** Rory and it was entirely frustrating.

- Why weren't Luke and Lorelai married yet, ffs?  I would have rather them have been happily married for the last decade than to see their wedding (which wasn't even the *real* wedding).

- Rose Abdoo as Gypsy AND Emily's maid was not funny???? I feel like I'm missing out on a joke.  I don't understand why this was a thing.

Also, I was happy with the ending, which I feel like is an unpopular opinion.  Those *Last Four Words* definitely would have been more satisfying in 2007, but THAT'S how it was supposed to end.  I don't think it matters who the father is (even though it's obvious because she was only sleeping with one person, but ok).  Everything was tied together at the end the way it was supposed to be 10 years ago.  I'm fine with it.

But it's something I've been wondering about for a while. It's easy to see how Rory benefits from the relationship -- Logan is charming, witty, loving, and fully respectful and supportive of Rory's choices, even when he doesn't agree with them. He brings spontaneity and adventure into her life. What I don't understand is what Logan gets from Rory. 

What does Logan, or even Jess, for that matter, see in Rory? Is it some kind of reverse bad boy attraction, where the guy wants to ""corrupt"" and ""conquer"" the innocent girl, the same way the girl wants to ""fix"" and ""tame"" the wild guy? Because Rory seems far too bland, personality-wise, for Logan. Especially considering how everyone loves to point out that Logan is a parallel to Christopher, but even if that were the case, Rory is not a parallel to Lorelai.

While we don't definitively know anything beyond those 4 final words, that doesn't mean we can't speculate based on foreshadowing in earlier seasons (since ASP seems to love patterns/parallel characters/the concept of ""full circle"" &amp; all that jazz), what happens in the revival, the numerous film and book references scattered throughout the series, interviews (with the Palladinos or the cast), and I'm sure other things that aren't occurring to me at this moment. 

While ASP herself might not have fully known how she would've gotten our favorite characters out of the messes she placed them in before leaving poor David Rosenthal to bring out the Lysol and roach motels, that doesn't mean there aren't clues for what she and Dan might've done. So, fellow GG fans, what're your theories? Share them below, no matter how far-fetched they may seem, since the Palladinos seemed to gravitate toward far-fetched in season 6 &amp; the revival anyway. Since no one knows anything beyond those 4 words, it's not like any of us can be judged as right or wrong in our speculation. 

Keep in mind that one of the key details in the Palladinos' contract negotiations was securing a 2-year contract, so feel free to speculate about the seasons 7 *and 8* that might've been (in other words, they probably would've only stuck around if there had been 2 more seasons). 

Also, if you haven't watched all seven seasons of the OS and all four episodes of *A Year in the Life*, approach this thread with caution, because I imagine it will be ripe with spoilers. You've been warned.

So Lorelai just lost all of their deposits for the June 3rd wedding because she was holding out that it would still happen. Then when she's discussing the wedding with Luke he suggests that they elope instead of ""planning this whole big thing"" or come back to Martha's Vineyard in the summer to get hitched instead.

Two problems with this. 1) They don't have to plan a *whole big thing* because it's already been planned. It's ready to go if they want to go through with June 3rd. 2) Luke suggesting eloping or Martha's Vineyard signals to me that he is still very much ready to get married that summer anyhow. I just feel like this conversation makes very little sense to the plot. If he feels ready enough to commit to a summer wedding then they should have just agreed to stick to the original plans.

My so-called friends are growing tired of hearing me rant endlessly on the subject, claiming they havent seen the show or have no idea what Im talking about . pitiful. However my need to rant cannot be denied, so here I am. Id like to preface this by saying Im not team Luke..I know, Im sorry, but HEAR ME OUT. Fair warning this gets very detailed and lengthy, so enjoy!!! (p.s. there are no revival spoilers but there may be some series spoilers!)
Lorelai had some great love interests. Seriously, even the bad ones were good. The worst was probably Jason (affectionately known as Digger). I dont think anyone really thought he was the one for Lorelai. Their relationship was fun and had its cute moments, but I couldnt ever take him seriously. He always seemed a little skeezy to me, plus his character as a whole seemed kind of random and unnecessary, which I think is because he was written for the sole purpose of further postponing Lorelai and Lukes relationship. I do however think they couldve had an awesome friend dynamic.
Now for one of my favorites, Christopher! He wasnt always very reliable, but definitely improved as the show went on. I think its important to note that he was in fact willing to marry Lorelai when she got pregnant, but it was her who insisted he keep living his life. Do I think thats an excuse for his major absence in so much of the girls lives? No, but I think its important to recognize. I hated how flighty he was in his relationships with both Rory and Lorelai, but you could see his regret and his subsequent increase in efforts to make up for his past throughout the show. Chris and Lorelais relationship was so easy- they knew each other inside and out, and their history created this unshakeable bond between them that even divorce couldnt break. They both admitted at some point in the show that they felt the other was the person theyd end up with, and I think that means something. The biggest issue with them was timing: by the time Christophers life had settled down and hed matured, too much had happened for Lorelai to maintain those feelings. I do think if the whole Sherry pregnancy thing didnt happen they couldve had a real shot, but I also think Cece was integral to his maturation process. Oh also the whole revenge marriage plot was super weird and uncool. Tl;dr they were great together but I get why they didnt work out, timing was always off.
Next up is the famous Luke. The Luke so many seem to consider it for Lorelai I disagree. Dont get me wrong, I love Luke, Lukes great! I love his heart of gold and the way he always knows how to make Lorelai feel better. I love that he cared for Rory as if she were his own long before he and Lorelai even seemed like a possibility. But I have to say, I always felt like Lorelais love for him came more from a love for Stars Hollow itself than him. He was this constant in her life since she had arrived and eventually became comfort for her, not to mention he was the keeper of the key to her livelihood (coffee), so its only natural that over time they developed a bond that to many came across as romantic, but to me seemed simply familial. Their relationship was great and definitely deserved to be explored, but they were always just so different it didnt seem realistic. I get that opposites attract or whatever but there wasnt even much attraction between themtheir banter was more Lorelai being witty and him pretending to be annoyed which was cute for a while, but not sustainable. My main issue is that he was never really able to keep up with her. Luke was this stabilizing force in Lorelais whirlwind life who provided her the safety and comfort of Stars Hollow in the form of an attractive diner owner who also happened to make the best coffee. He was like her house that she refused to get rid of (uncoincidentally the house Luke had come over to fix up a million times), despite there being houses introduced that were better suited for her changing needs (more room for a family, stables, etc) also in Stars Hollow that would allow her to maintain the comfort of the town but also continue to grow (see next paragraph), she preferred changing what she had to fit what she needed because she was too comfortable for change. I definitely think Luke and Lorelai learned a lot from each other and understand the appeal of the relationship, but I feel like it was too heavily based on safety and how easy he made it for everything to stay the same. ALSO side note him being so weird about April and the wedding to Lorelai was super annoying and I supported the breakup DONT @ ME!!!!
Now, for the moment youve all been waiting for, time to discuss my #1 favorite Lorelai guy, the man who I think was best suited to be her one, Mr. MAX MEDINA!!!!! I just love Max you guys, I rlly rlly do. He was kind, funny, smart, mature, hot, had great chemistry with Lorelai, and treated her perfectly. Not to mention how great he treated Rory despite the obviously awkward teacher-dating-students-parent circumstances, or even after things didnt work out (need I remind you of I really wanted to be your stepdad. Ugh. sob). PLUS when he came back after she shattered his heart and the attraction was still too much for either of them to handle???? Oh come on. Max was definitely the best match for Lorelai both in wits and in emotion. He understood but also challenged her, which is the combination I think she most desperately needed. He was always very up front about his feelings and expected the same from her. Lorelai goes back and forth throughout the series on whether or not she truly loved him, but even if she didnt at the time I think things wouldve been very different after Rory moved out. I dont think anyone couldve made it to the final cut with Rory still at home, even Luke, because her and Rorys relationship was way too precious, any sudden movements wouldve scared Lorelai off- which is what happened. Lorelai didnt start showing serious doubt about the relationship until Max stayed over for the night and it finally hit her that his presence would mean a change in her relationship with Rory. Max was definitely the best guy for Lorelai, and if they hadnt rushed the relationship or if theyd instead met later in the series I think it wouldve worked out between them.",11,8,False,self,,,,,

Its so fascinating to me. Lorelei runs from her mother because she doesnt want to be like her, yet she is. Shes more like her mother than she would like to admit.

Meanwhile, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) take a job catering a kids' ""Lord of the Rings"" birthday party to make ends meet while their new inn is under construction. Finally, Richard (Edward Herrmann) announces that he is taking on a new business partner named Digger Stiles (guest star Chris Eigeman), who is the son of Richard's former business partner.

It's the kind of show that invites multiple viewings, and there are so many things you can pick out with each new viewing. 

So folks on this sub, what details have you noticed on multiple viewings that you didn't realize the first umpteen times you watched the show? 

For me, there are two: 

1) I only recently realized, when rewatching ""Bridesmaids Revisited,"" that Paris is left-handed. As a fellow leftie, how did I miss this important detail before? It's the scene when Rory shows up at the apartment after she's had a fight with Logan, and Paris has had a fight with Doyle, and the two of them share a ton of take-out together on the couch. 

2) In ""New and Improved Lorelai,"" there's a scene where Kirk chases after Luke, trying to get back the engagement ring that Luke has bought from him, shouting, ""Please, Luke. Please, please, please, please, please,"" which echoes the opening words of the pilot, when Lorelai says, ""Please, Luke. Please, please, please."" Nice callback, Palladinos! ",24,12,False,self,,,,,

For example:
1. In the first episode of Season 1, Lorelai says that Rory is 16, then a few episodes later she has her 16th birthday?
2. In Season 3 Episode 18 it's Lorelai's birthday, Richard says 'happy 36th birthday' but she tells him she is 35 this year. Considering Rory is now a Senior at school wouldn't that make her 17/18?

In Nick and Nora, Sid and Nancy, she's super condescending to him and tells him how good he has it and how she mastered the world can bite her butt in heels no less and then tells him she wants to throw a cream pie in his face. She calls him a little jerk and then goes off on Luke after the car accident and accuses Jess of almost killing Rory and asks Luke why he brought Jess to town.  She tells him that everyone hates Jess but Luke wouldn't send him home or make him leave. She tells him that Luke has an obligation to the town and to her and Rory. The town has a meeting behind his back to discuss the Jess situation.  Granted Jess wasn't an angel but he was a troubled kid and Luke wanted to be there for his nephew.  I love the Luke/Jess relationship and I think its telling that Jess keeps going back to the same lake Luke pushed him into.  He has this emotional connection to the lake and to Luke. I have always though that the way Lorelai reacted towards Jess and the town trying to get rid of him played a big role in Luke wanting to keep April to himself for awhile.  He wanted to enjoy getting to know his daughter and figure things out before the town and Lorelai butt in.  He was probably also worried that Lorelai would be upset April would take Luke's attention and focus away from her and Rory also or that Lorelai would insult April the way she insults Jess.  
I also had another thought.  I wonder if Rory actually told Jess that he shouldn't be anywhere near Lorelai when she found out about the accident and that's why Jess didn't go with Rory to the hospital.  ",9,8,False,self,,,,,

Her mother, a single mother like Lorelai who raised her along with the grandmother (Jane only knew her father until she was 22-23) auto-invited herself to the party. They are close but not as much as the Gilmore girls; 

So a lot happened during the episode and reached its dramatic climax when her mother got drunk and kissed a younger man (and an ex of a friend of Jane) 

Jane got angry and exclaimed to her mother:

""It's not fair! You know why I'm such a control freak, Mom? Because I grew up with you and you are so out of control!"" 

Can this be the case of Rory as well? Growing up with a carefree mother made her much more responsible at a young age? 

Lorelai is certainly more mature and responsible than the mother in Jane the Virgin (though I skipped episodes on the latter); but Jane also has a very maternal and responsible  grandmother who lives with them so her mother is not the only figure on her life unlike Rory. 

Then later on the episode the protagonist said to her fianc:

""... and my Mom keep telling me to lose control, but I couldn't until you got here. Because I know you're watching over me. 
Instead of me always having to watch over everyone else.""

So many people says Rory declined, personality wise, on her Yale days and even worst under Logan's influence.

3. what the heck are paris' politics? she seems like a fascist/monarch sympathizer at times, makes eugenicist-type jokes, yet has a noam chomsky poster on her wall.
4. lots of russian revolution and romanov jokes. did amy sherman-palladino or daniel palladino major in russian studies or something?

6. matt czuchry is a horrible actor. sorry. he has like 2 facial expressions. and i don't like logan at all; the show really starts to go downhill for me once he sinks his claws into rory (by manipulating her)
7. the episode when jess comes to visit rory made me realize that if she'd ended up with jess, she could have been surrounded by way better people
8. also realized that this show isn't very feminist at all at times; rory tends to escape into romantic relationships. i wish she had been single for a longer period of time (remember the jokes about the ""dry spell""? why couldn't that have lasted longer?!). she also doesn't have a lot of girl friends outside of lane (who she doesn't talk to super often or reveal much personal info to), paris (who ends up spending most of her time with doyle or academic stuff), and the hackneyed/forced friendships with lucy and olivia towards the end

I can only imagine what Amy would have done to fulfill her weird circle fantasy. Rory would be pregnant and divorced. Not that its a bad situation to be in but as a Logan fan there's no bouncing back from that! 


I just needed to get that off my chest because I before the revival at the rejection always bummed me out but now with the revival not so much!",29,20,False,spoiler,,,,,

I had the normal amount of burn out and finished. But I feel like most students should be able to take a break. If you're not motivated, it's not enough to go through the motions. I think Lorelai was quite unreasonable. Maybe she would have lost momentum, but if she never found her way back, it meant she didn't want it enough.

Whereas her grandparents actually did have a sensible plan. If she wants time off, take some time off. We'll find something constructive for her to do so she's not wasting all of her time.  

If Lorelai had given Rory some space and she hadn't ran off to be with her grandparents would the situation have shaped up differently? ",74,18,False,self,,,,,

Sherman Palladino hinted that Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) might get together someday, but she doesn't want to rush it.

""I think it's what we're all working toward, whether we do it before the end [of the series] or at the end,"" she said. ""It's one of the key touchstones of our show. You've got this woman working so hard to make it and her partner is right around the corner. If either one of them would just let the wall down for five seconds and keep the quips to a minimum and maybe say something real to each other, their lives would be very different.""

I think its interesting how she seems undecided on the direction of L&amp;L plot line, even though the season four finale (their first kiss in the Dragonflys porch) was months away. 

Was she not planning on them getting together that season? Im guessing that the ratings had to do with it, in that case.

Im curious as to what the original plan was, and how/until what point she was gonna have the will they/wont they continue to play out. Do you think she was considering it to resolve it in the series finale?

For instance, I adore Season 1 Rory. 

In Lorelais case, I feel that while shes great in most seasons, she was at her best in Season 4 during the Dragonfly arc. 

Personally, I believe that Emily is at her most nuanced in Season 1, very much like Rory. ",9,17,False,self,,,,,

**The Fundamental Things Apply** - What do you say when there's nothing to talk about? Rory's (Alexis Bledel) first college date is a dud. Meanwhile, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) asks Luke (Scott Patterson) to take Rory's place in a Gilmore tradition: Movie Night.

I'm a major fan of GG like my mother and sister and although we are not from the US, we are coming to visit the country next month. We were planning to rent a car for the trip Boston to New York from a Saturday morning till Sunday. Our only major stop until now is Martha's Vineyard - which I believe we could see in one morning till mid-evening (we are usually very time-efficient).

However, I don't know what else we should visit and am looking forward to making some stops in between that are famous in the series and to decide by those where we should sleep. I've seen that Hartford and Yale are on the way, but are they worth visiting? Is there a town with a Stars Hollow's vibe to it? I'm not looking forward to seeing any museums or lengthy tours, but to wandering around a town or a building with a charming New England vibe to it.

My mom would slapped the taste out of my mouth if I had said that. Rory runs off to her grandparents' house without telling Lorelai (this after she saw how freaked out Lorelai was when she was out all night with Dean) and she doesn't get into trouble.  She should have been grounded.  I know Lorelai was big on not being anything like her parents but it's like she took the opposite extreme by being too permissive.
