0,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2017-4-1,2017,4,1,10,62pl1e,self.GilmoreGirls,How much money do you think each of the characters/families had?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/62pl1e/how_much_money_do_you_think_each_of_the/,mintantoinette,1491008677,"At first, I was going to ask how much money everyone thought Christopher inherited. But then, I realized this question would be SO much more interesting!

Christopher  I think Christopher inherited somewhere around 38 to 50 million from his grandfather.

Gilmores - Richard earns $2 million a year annually (CEOs of insurance companies actually get about $10-17 million in real life, but I don't think that matches with the show), and then $8 million in stocks, investments, and bonds (Richard is good with saving)

The Huntzbergers - $200 million a year 

Sookie &amp; Jackson - $120,000 each a year (they both earned $60,000 a year). They never seem to struggle for money, but they're not exactly loaded either. I think they save most of it in college funds for their kids, as well as paying off bills, for the farm, mortgage, etc. It would not surprise me if Jackson supported some of his family members, too. $120,000 in America for a big family is comfortable, but not extravagant.

The Gilmores -- I think Lorelai earned 50k a year at the beginning of the show, but did not manage it well. After she opened her own inn (which she did without taking out bank loans), I would put her more at 60k or 70k a year.

Luke - This one was really hard! Luke is a small-town restaurant owner, but he lives very, *very* cheaply. He owns the building his restaurant is in &amp; lives in an apartment above it, so he does not pay anything for rent, and I would imagine his food costs are low because he buys everything in bulk for his restaurant &amp; probably eats from that. (You rarely see him grocery shopping.) I would guess that he probably earns 80k to 100k a year in profit (his restaurant is always packed!), but spends about $8k a year on himself. However, he does not do anything with his money, so I would say he has about $596,000 in the bank now. No holdings or stock.

Kirk - Last time we checked with Kirk, he had enough money to buy a house. However, after that scene, he began selling diamonds old ladies gave him. He is very industrious and willing to go far to make money, so I would say he has $800,000 in the bank now, and also some bizarre land holdings in other countries.

Miss Kim - Miss Kim donates about half of her money to the church, and then puts much of it away for Lane's future. I think she probably gets 80k a year from rare antique dealings, and she also owns her own house/shop.",129,38,False,self,,,,,

As someone who doesn't despise his character, it's kind of hard for me to agree with the statement. However, I have come to think that while Rory is of course to blame for the events that took place, it was Dean who kind of ruined the dynamic between himself and Rory. 

Early in the show, the first time they break up, he has a completely explosive reaction to Rory not returning the ""I love you"". It's not that Rory doesn't have feelings for Dean, she just isn't ready to say it to him. When she breaks down and says it to him a while later after moping for weeks, prompting their relationship's revival, it feels less like a romantic turning point and more like a desperate cry for loving attention from someone.  It may stem from her abandonment issues with her father. He kind of forces Rory into saying it just to get him back, with her knowing he will drop everything for her. 

In the end, it seems that his temper tantrum did nothing but push Rory further away. She does care for him, but I don't know that she ever felt for him what he consistently felt for her.

Since all the hype about the revival I decided to do a proper rewatch and finish the show. And I'm mad. Does everyone involved with this show hate women? 
So here's a list of things that make me angry. Sorry if some of this is incoherent or has been mentioned before, I just need to rant. 



1. You can have a family or have a successful career but not both. 

Emily is a mother but her career is taking care of her husband. To be fair this seems to make her happy for the most part. So maybe one could argue she had a successful career as a housewife, but still her relationship with her daughter is less than ideal. 

Lane dreams of being a drummer. She gets pregnant in her early 20s and instead of considering the fact that she is in no way ready for children and abortion is in fact an option for many people, she chooses to abandon her dreams and career goals and have children. Then she agrees to her husband going on tour with a band while she stays home with two newborns. She's fine with her man pursuing his career while she is unable to pursue her own because she had children. 

Paris is the most driven and ambitious female character on the show. I honestly don't even understand why she had children. Do the writers realize there are people who are happy and satisfied with their lives without ever having children? But Paris had to start a family too, and while she ended up successful in her career, her marriage is over. 

Sookie left the Dragonfly Inn, her dream job where she is co-owner with her best friend to pursue her husband's vegetable growing career? Also what the hell was that whole Jackson didn't get a vasectomy and Sookie got pregnant with a third child thing? Everyone just has to be okay with accidental pregnancies? She said she was done having children after the second one. Again, abortions exist. 

Sherry (Chris' girlfriend) is a driven career oriented women who abandons her child in order to work in France. Sure she tries to get back into Gigi's life later bit still the pattern continues, women can't have everything. 

Rory is struggling with her career but hey we just found out she's pregnant, I bet she's going to be a successful journalist while raising a child. /s

Lorelai appears to be the only exception to this rule. She has a successful career and relationship with her daughter although her love life takes a long time to get on track. 



2. It's okay to treat women like dirt as long as they're slutty or unintelligent. 

I'm not even going to get into the verbal slut and fat shaming that goes on in this show. Roy's highschool friends had no personalities aside from being slutty unintelligent frenemies, that's all they are, nothing else nor do they accomplish anything else. Jess dates a girl while waiting for Rory to break up with Dean, she is disposable because she's slutty and unintelligent. Dean longs for Rory who is ""so smart she will save the world"" and cheats on his less intelligent wife with Rory. Logan sister's bridesmaids all slept with Logan and they're all okay with it and are all still friends because they're slutty and slutty women don't have real emotions or personalities. The show teaches us women are disposable and of lesser value if they're slutty, unintelligent or fat so don't worry about them. 



3. It's okay if men treat you like dirt. And it's okay to treat men like dirt. 

I don't even know where to start. Rory cheats on Dean, Rory cheats on Jess, Rory and Dean cheat on his wife. Logan sleeping with a whole group of bridesmaids. Not cheating on your partner should be considered the norm, not a success. Logan fucking up Rory's friendship because he was  ""jealous"" of Marty. Rory tries to use Jess to cheat on Logan. Speaking of, when she tells Jess about Logan ""despite all the bad he's done I can't help it I'm in love with him"" sounds an awful lot like an abusive relationship. Controlling abusive relationships are already romanticized in the media (Twilight, 50 shades) and I understand that this is just a TV show but young women do look up to characters on TV shows and base life decisions on them subconsciously or otherwise. I just wish for better and stronger female role models on TV.

I just wanted to vent a little, I'll probably get crucified for what I am about to say but I just need to talk about it.

So I was watching the car crash episode (haven't watched it all, kinda late and need sleep) and I just have to say I hate Jess. I also hate Rory at this point. Everyone in the show treats Rory like an angel, she can't do no wrong and I'm kinda sick about it. She openly flirts with Jess, once even in Dean's presence but hey, it's ok. And fucking Jess, oh woe me I'm missunderstood, manipulating everyone including that moron Rory with his bad boy act. I know that this series is all about drama but it just irks me. Dean is clearly not the perfect boyfriend but everyone blaming him for everything including being paranoid about Rory and Jess, which clearly is a thing, but hey he's jealous and possesive and omg poor Rory is being abused.

Fuck this wound up not making much sense. Anyway, hate Jess's attitude and manipulative shit, hate Rory's holier than thou status and specially hate how unfairly (unfair for the most part, he clearly has faults) Dean is treated in this whole mess. Why couldn't Rory just break up with him and date Jess openly instead of doing shit like this.

So I've rewatched this series at least 15 times. I love having it play as I'm cleaning or surfing the web. Today I just noticed something that I never have before. So at the beginning of ""One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes"" S3E4, the girls are standing by the door at Luke's getting ready to leave. Then Shane (Jess's blonde girlfriend) rushes past them to go suck on Jess's face. Then Lorelai says, ""That girl's a freak!!""

I started last december and just finished the last episode and I am appalled. I can't imagine how everyone else who waited almost 10 years for this feels.

I can't even remember how many times I cried throughout the original show - but it was a lot! AYITL was just so unreal to me. Rory's character is now a loser, who still is in love with her college sweetheart, who still doesn't care about who she hurts in the process of getting what she wants (dean, his wife, jess, paul, logan, his fiance, who cares!) I was so excited for her to focus on herself for once at the end of s7, and be able to go out into the world and grow up a bit, and become successful. The only reason I started watching GG is because of how well Netflix usually makes shows, so I was excited to watch AYITL. Now I wish I would have stopped after s7! The characters were flat, the plot was boring. Other than Emily's story, that was something I definitely wanted to see. I don't know if the fact that I watched GG so close to AYITL made it that much worse, because of how different it was?

All the hate on Emily (I saw people on this very thread calling her ""a horrible mother"") is greatly exaggerated. 
She was far from being a horrible mother. First, putting Lorelai through all the best schools and even wanting to help raise her daughter so she can still have an education does not scream ""horrible mother"". Sure, Lorelai felt ""suffocated"" and whatnot but on the other hand, Emily's behaviour and attitude towards children education are completely understandable seeing the social class they're part of. And in the flashbacks we have of Lorelai being a teenager she is a pain in the ass: drinking, mocking her parents, laughing at them behind their back, sleeping around, getting pregnant at 16... none of this shows good character. And then she just up and leaves, without a note? I remember an episode when Richard said ""your mother couldn't get out of bed for two months"" which is a glimpse of the things we don't get to see since we mostly look at Emily through Lorelai's POV. And the hypocrisy Lorelai shows is just too much. When Lane runs to Rory at Yale, Lorelai says she will call Mrs Kim because she has the right to know, but I don't remember a moment when she apologised to her own mom for doing the exact same thing, and with a newborn baby. 
She never allows Emily to be in her life and shows nothing but contempt for her parents lifestyle. Granted, they might be uptight and elitist and sometimes downright cruel, but nothing so bad as to warrant such a behaviour from their only daughter. They never turned their back on her. They were ready to help raise Rory (not all parents would be so okay with their kid being pregnant at 16), they were always happy to help with money or anything else and they only got rejection in return. Emily complains on numerous occasions that Lorelai doesn't let her help.

My favorite episode, though I have a top 10 list, has always been the aforementioned for so many reasons. The music, the costumes, the contest, Luke and Lorelai discussing children, Dean and Rory's breakup, Jess and Rory finally admitting to each other how they feel.. ugh so many good things.

I will however say that Dean could have handled the break up better. I realize, the situation was not fair to him and Rory had been stringing him along for months. All in all, this was her first boyfriend and she had no idea what she was doing/feeling. Not trying to defend her, but I was a teenager once. My thought has always been that she felt guilty for feeling some type of way about someone who wasn't her boyfriend and wound up staying in the relationship because she felt it is what she should do given as Dean was such a ""good"" boyfriend. I personally think he was very emotionally imbalanced with anger and jealousy issues, but hey, teenage boy right?

From my perspective the story lines that really bugged other people made a lot of sense to me. The main one being the downfall of Rory Gilmore. I think a lot of people took issue with the way Rory had changed but one thing people forget about Rory in the original series is that she was always super fucked up when it comes to relationships. Whether that might be an extension of Lorelai's issues, or not having Christopher around, etc, but she was always kind of a mess in that department. Remember when she ghosted Dean because she was so utterly freaked out that he had said I love you? It didn't end there, from boning married Dean at 19, to the way Logan acted in season 5. It's always been a shit show so I wasn't surprised to find her sleeping with an engaged Logan in the revival and constantly forgetting Paul.
She also spent her entire adolescence and early adulthood on a pedestal that she was bound to fall off. Even with the dropping out of Yale thing and the yacht thing Rory was still seen as this perfect person and I think the revival set out to knock her down a peg. She had always gotten what she want. She felt entitled because she had had things come so easily, it was a wake up call. I don't think it was much of a stretch for her character at all.

In my search for girlmoregirls aspergers, I came across a post that has left me livid. And, to my irate displeasure, I accidentally ""upvoted"" this post. Explitivvvvvves.

The post was in response to a casual take on aspergers and the Gilmore parents. This person said something to the effect of ""as a clinician who works with people with ASD, we all have those traits... characters... blah... even Lorelei and Rory are exaggerated characters... etc"".

Wow. As someone who is actually ON THE SPECTRUM, not just a mere clinician who has decided to speak for all of us as a group, I am deeply offended. 

I am one person. I have ASD. My personal opinion is that, while Lorelei is a character and not a person, she is the only woman I feel even remotely connected with in terms of my ""aspergirl-ness"".

The medal looks just like Luke's coffee machine, and I like to think of it as the ""cathedral of caffeine"" LOL!  The race is called the ""None. Plus? 5k"" inspired by the first conversation that Luke and Lorelai ever have where he grills her about how many cups of coffee she's had and she lies and tells him none, but he counters by asking her ""plus?"" and she admits she's actually had 5 cups already.  The back of the medal features the quote ""You've got wings, baby"" that Lorelai tells Luke after he agrees to pour her another cup.  

The charity this race is benefitting is Grounds for Health, a 501(c)3 saving lives in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Peru through screening women for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the developing world because the equipment and expertise to screen for and treat abnormal cells BEFORE they become cancerous is simply absent. 

If enough people register for the race, the club can purchase and deploy a cyrotherapy device and CO2 tanks filled with enough CO2 to treat 50 women. 

A race shirt is available separately and it has just about every coffee-related quote from the show on the front!
