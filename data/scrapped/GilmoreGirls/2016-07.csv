I've noticed that in Season 1, certain aspects of a character or storylines appear here that appear later on in the series. Mostly Rory related.

For example, in s1 e20 after the discussion with Lorelai, Roy runs off to her grandparents' house to cool off and get away from her mother / Stars Hollow. It reminded me of the end of season 5 when Rory told Lorelai she wouldn't be going back to Yale and the big fight ensues. She once again runs to her grandparents and moves in with them this time.

The other example is in s2 e1 when Rory brings Dean to her grandparents' house for the celebration of her being top 3% of her class. Richard treats Dean very unfairly and states full well that the family has ""standards."" Rory was special and Dean wasn't so to speak. This reminded me of season 5 once again when it came to Logan's family expressing the same to Rory at dinner.

Paris completely dismisses this. She plays it safe and goes original Elizabethan. This is... I honestly don't know the word for it. Paris should be well versed in assignments/tests/exams terminology now to recognize the key word (i.e. 'examine', 'discuss', 'compare', etc.), it's just out of character. It was worth 50% of their final grade. Then again, maybe she's like [those students in Chinese schools that are so focus on getting the RIGHT answers and only the RIGHT answers that they completely lose all critical thought and if you ask them to imagine the world in 100 years they start building a time machine.](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1940-china-one-place-american-teachers-are-treated-as-stars_p2.html)

This has bothered me for a long time. I just thought it was the writers way of getting Rory and Tristan into this intimate situation without making her join the drama club. But the fact they did the assignment wrong was never brought up. This show doesn't have Mad Men or Breaking bad levels of continuity control and attention to minutiae. So I just chalked this up to an intentional plot hole because the writers didn't really care.

But then today while re-watching the episode, I had a thought. In the end it wasn't traditional. Romeo and Juliet were both played by girls. My thought is that after their performance, their teacher came up to them, at first be critical of their choice of a traditional theme, but commend them on their parallel of R&amp;J's forbidden love, to societies views on Homosexuality. Everyone would have been shocked and confused but went with it so they could pass. 

I think this could have been how the episode was suppose to end, but probably got changed because of the possible controversy you'd get back then for showing any acknowledgement of homosexuality on network television.

Note: It has come to my attention that I made a generalization about Chinese people in my first paragraph. I apologize for any offense I may have cause. I wrote said part with recent information from a cracked.com I read recently in mind and made a connection between Paris's character and the authors observation of how Chinese students are taught to think. By not citing my source or explaining the reasoning for my opinion, I framed it as Chinese people being unimaginative simply for being Chinese and not as a byproduct of the environment of China's education system. This does not accurately illustrate my view of the Chinese. Once again I apologize and take the full fault for my own careless and poor writing.",17,27,False,self,,,,,

Yes, news has been slow. So just for fun, here's the spoilers I was able to pull from the short video. Let me know if you caught any I might've missed!

1.  Rory has traveled the world since 'bon voyage' including to London. Her look will be more sophisticated than college-Rory. Apparently Rory has a favorite hat? I'm guessing a winter hat?

2. The Dragonfly Inn is apparently doing really well now and Lorelai is a little more established financially, her wardrobe will reflect this. But she'll still sport her jeans and t-shirts with nods to Diane von Furstenberg wrap dresses that look ah-mahzing on her.

3. I think it's strange that she didn't mention Luke or Emily or Lane. I guess we're left to assume they'll all have the same looks from when we left them in S7. That, or she just didn't touch on their characters. Luke, flannel and jeans, backwards cap. Done.

The Boys

Option # 1: Dean's look will be the same just a more matured look, having aged 10 years and been in the workforce. Based on the video we saw of him in fall, he could just be dressed as Jared.

Option #2: Jess will still look like Jess but again more matured. Sounds like Milo had a lot to say in his look. Lots of dark colors and grays. A lot of emphasis on him being more matured, but still the same person inside.

Option #3: Logan (the most revealing spoilers!), no more turtleneck sweaters (thank god!), makes a lot of money now, lives in London (Rory has traveled to London?) so has a bit of European flair to his look, doesn't answer to anyone as far as his personal style goes (which I take to mean he doesn't have a significant other).",14,14,False,self,,,,,

That last break up

What if he just thought: F**k it, Im gonna stick to it, because I love this girl, with my every being. And rather just swallow any ""pride"", and have her break up with him if that was inevitable. Like a true athlete, he could stay until the bitter end(or sweet)

I think its kinda lame that he broke up with her because he saw that their lives were so different, and that he thought he would be holding her back. How is it up to him to say that he would be holding her back!? 

Yes, Rory wants to travel, and see the world, but she is also an individual who knows what she want with her life. Maybe after a while it would be an adventure with Dean. She finished her education, got a degree, got Dean with her on travels, or he stayed at home and she traveled. It could work!

Rory answers: Their better than none though


I just think that its her life, and when Dean makes that ""decision"" he kinda takes her ability to choose away, like she ""doesnt know whats best for her"" which is kinda sexist, and happens way to often in drama..(rant..)

Even though I consider myself quite capable of viewing things with a critical eye and have been known to get frustrated by the show, its plots, and its characters at times, I get defensive when I see anyone criticizing the show.  Even when those people are fellow fans.  I find myself performing all sorts of mental gymnastics to try and make even valid complaints OK in my head.

I've decided to put this penchant of mine to good use.  I thought it would be fun for us to put ourselves in a positive mindset.  So, in the grand tradition of a crazy Sookie trying to make Norman Mailer eat some freaking lunch, I've decided to turn my insanity into a game.

Bring me your complaints about the show and I will endeavor to assuage your frustrations.  It can be anything from a character flaw to a plot hole or an inconsistency. The more specific the better, as my responses will get infuriatingly lengthy if you're just asking me to explain away the Dean. For example, instead of bringing me the complaint that Dean is the worst, maybe choose his most egregious failing in your eyes.  Obviously, I can't fix canon character flaws, or plot holes or inconsistencies, but I will try to make everything more tolerable. 

Anyone else is welcome to jump in if they think they can rationalize better than I. 

Note, while I am perfectly willing to engage in a respectful debate, please keep in mind that I am likely playing devil's advocate in many of these circumstances, so no need to get too angry when I seem to disagree with you.  At the end of the day, I just genuinely enjoy watching this show, and wish everyone could enjoy it as much as I do.

In fact, Max Medina seemed to have more interesting chemistry with Lorelai than whiny Christopher did through *all 7 seasons combined*. Of course, I am happy that Luke and Lorelai are together, but it would be interesting in a sort of *Sex and the City Movie* kind of way, if Max were briefly back in Lorelai's life in some way -- I believe it would have tugged at viewer's hearts in some way, offering a different nostalgia, as we'd remember Lorelai from the beginning, where thoughts of her and Luke together were but a distant murmur, and there was this sort of utopia dream of Max and the Gilmore girls being one family in Stars Hollow. And, I'd just like to see what that smart gorgeous man is up to nowadays; maybe he'd offer some insights to Rory and her struggling career, be a sort of surrogate father to her. I think that would have been sweet.
As for Marty, his short-lived presence in Rory's life may actually bother me most about the series. I feel that her last interaction with Marty, wherein he's magically transformed into this superdouche who can't admit he really knows her, was just a poorly-orchestrated and apathetic way of disposing of a character that it'd been decided just wasn't going to be useful to Rory's character and timeline anymore. When I had first watched that part of the series, and had just been acquainted with Marty's character, I took his juxtaposition with the smarmy, self-assured Logan as a clear sign that Rory may, at most, have some brief crush/fling with Logan, until she saw he was a spoiled son of a a business tycoon, who had no real passion or deserving place in the academic world. In contrast, Marty seemed like a sweet and interesting character, a potential boyfriend for Rory -- perhaps some may argue that they were too alike, though to me it seemed natural that Rory would be with someone who had a passionate interest in something, even if he weren't super bright/privileged. These opinions may be coming from a place of total bias indeed, as I have never warmed up to Logan's character, let alone Rory's decision to embark on a relationship with him. The sorts of decisions she made during their relationship, the putting-on-hold of her academic studies at Yale, all just seemed like red flags that could be traced back to her infatuation with Yale-bro Logan. But perhaps this is an entirely different rant.
Anyway, I realize one can't get everything one wants from a Revival, and from the cast list, it seems almost everyone is back, so I almost feel like a butthole in complaining. But dang, Christopher?? Logan??!

1. When he sees Rory around Stars Hollow, rudely avoids her, blurts out he loves her, and drives away.

2. When he shows up at Yale ranting about how Rory wants to be with him, how he knows her ""better than anyone"" (presumptuous much?), and how she should leave Yale to be with him (living under a bridge, perhaps?).

3. When he shows up to show her his book and yells at her about leaving Yale and displays the massive chip on his shoulder about rich guys.

4. When she visits his hipster publishing house and they kiss and he tells her she can tell Logan they slept together. 

Does any of this sound like a stable guy with his shit together? Why the constant panting over a guy who we barely see after season 3? 

""Grown-up Jess would be perfect for Rory!!!111!"". What are people basing this on? Points 3 and/or 4? 

""He's changed soooo much!"". I should *hope* so, as he was pure angry scum in high-school. Just because he has a job, sort of, and has people he doesn't hate (his coworkers I guess, and Luke) doesn't mean he's in any way *good*, just normal. 

Frankly Jess's lasting obsession with Rory is pretty sad. They broke up when they were 17-18, and at 22 he's still mooning over her and kissing her. Their high-school relationship was shitty and imbalanced and he was just a crap boyfriend and she was spineless. Just because he reads books and wrote a novel doesn't mean he's the perfect guy for Rory.

The whole point (well, one of) Rory's character arc was growing up from a sheltered teen in a modest home that stressed how evil rich people are to a much more confident and worldly young woman who learned how to use the advantages given to her (Yale, journalism connections) and find personal success. Jess fits into that in no way. He's still a defensive anti-rich ""rebel"" (much like young Lorelai) who makes fun of guys with nice cars and would feel as uncomfortable in that world as, well, Luke. Jess and Luke are two sides of the same coin (just one is literate and the other is a borderline caveman). Imagine ""grown-up Jess"" at a social event in Rory's circle. Yeah, pretty grim.

Anyway, the Jess love is at maximum levels around here and pretty much everywhere else. My question is, what are people basing it on? Not high-school Jess (who has few, if any, redeeming qualities), but ""grown-up Jess.""",97,52,False,self,,,,,

We are all like Babeth who need to have to say at something because we watch her grow up and we all felt like we are part of the Gilmores lives, so when the show ended with Rory moving in another phase of her life without bringing any boy is quite sad for us. Rory's love life has been a huge part of the show but at the end of the day it just showcase how that she is an independent woman who could stand on her own no matter what, and that what has been the series wanted to show us. 

But still wont stop us to fight for our bets right?
Who is the best boyfriend anyway for Rory? 

Answer? 

All of them. 

Yes. After the 2015 reunion Milo Ventimiglia (Jess) and Matt Czuchry (Logan) told in the interview that ""The right boyfriend, came at the right time"" which are actually words from its own creator Amy Sherman-Palladino herself. Which totally makes sense, do you imagine a Logan in Rory's high school days, they would have been in a total complete world and Rory is not mature enough to take in Logan's action. How about Jess in Yale days. It would mean he hasnt realize the things he could do with his life and still acts like a prick to everyone, it wouldnt help Rory at all in his fast paced life at Yale and Jess bad boy acts would totally get Rory in trouble. And a Dean for the campaign trail? Uh-oh that would have been a disaster for Dean becoming a housewife. God know where he is anyway. Hes been the perfect first boyfriend and them being an endgame would be a nice idea but with Rory's life moving forward. He'd be dragging Dean all the way and he wont make it out alive. 

So all in all, it was a great writing of timeline from the creator. It fits perfectly on every aspect of Rory's life. The relationship wasnt perfect, because sure there were tears and heartbreaks but that what just make the Rory Gilmore we have right now. 

And with the upcoming Revival hopefully we would have our girl walk that aisle with the perfect man standing there waiting for her. Could it be one of the three or we'll see a new man entering Rory's life? Because Alexis Bledel (Rory) think so too. Lets just wait and see and have Amy surprise us. Because for sure it will be perfect.

Also in this episode I cannot believe that Lorelai did not seek Rory out after that exchange (she ends up having s*x with Chris on the balcony and doesn't talk to Rory about the exchange until they get home), I like that she sought her dad out.

I could try to analyze this somehow..

The only explanation I could come up with is like Luke and Rachel, Luke perhaps didn't give it his all because frankly he's wanted to be with Lorelai long before he realized it and perhaps he sabotages his relationships due to that in the long run.

Rory moving to Yale obviously effected her a lot and got her out of her comfort zone in the way that she had to develop a new life without her around.

Lorelai is at her funniest, I believe, as well. It seems ASP was most comfortable writing for her in this season. Like she new her best. 

It was fun to see Lorelai put more focus on her friendship/relationship with Luke. She seemed more vulnerable throughout this season. She's vulnerable in the later seasons but is definitely more closed off in the early seasons.

- Rory is such a lucky girl. Throughout the series it was pretty loud and clear how intelligent she is. It's just too much though. She never really had a hard time studying compared to Paris but still ended up being valedictorian (come on) and getting accepted to all 3 universities she applied to? I hoped they added more problems for her. I wished she wasn't the valedictorian or I hoped she didn't get into Harvard. Just to show her how life can be bad. She sleeping with a married man didn't even turn bad at all as well. Still, she got the guy. I admit that was the first interesting thing about her but still she got what she wanted. Do you remember when she was pretty sure she's going to get a bad grade in her paper then, of course, she got an A from Asher. What was the point of that.

- Lorelai, sometimes, need to shut up. I get more annoyed by her need to keep joking around and most of the time it really isn't that funny. However, I like her as a person who worked her way from being a runaway pregnant teenage to managing an inn. I hoped we get to see that struggle though since the beginning of the series, they're pretty much settled in.

- I feel like an old soul for agreeing with Emily in some cases. She went to Yale, too, right? What did she major in?

- There isn't one rich character in the show that isn't snobby. Most of the parents are mean. All rich boys, Christopher and Logan, hate their fathers. Even Lorelai hate her parents.

- How come the people in Star Hollows have their own quirks but no prominent quirky trait for the 2 Gilmore girls? 

- They definitely picked Yale to keep the story going.

- I want to recreate the Gilmore's house on Sims. 

- Casual racism and one breastfeeding shaming scene

- This is just me but I was furious that Rory only have 2 skirts and Lorelai wouldn't let Emily buy her more. I went to high school that required uniforms and I have more than 2 skirts.

- I don't like Dean. If Rory ends up with Dean, I would think she's just settling with him.

I have to say, it was actually a really cute show. Not only did I love seeing a lot of the old GG characters as new people, Sutton Foster was great as the lead character. Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore) was fun to watch, she wasn't as up tight as her previous role, and it worked well for her. Sutton Foster is actually really funny, her facial expressions, body movement, the fast talking, all was a delight to see. 

Of course it had that great ASP feel to it, love of coffee, fast talking, obscure pop culture facts. And the dancing was really nice. All of the actresses were or are actual dancers and singers. So it was really cool to see it, and it wasn't too Broadway in your face. Sadly it was only one season, so there is no closure to the show. But it's very cute.

Yay! 

* **Empty cups.** Why does nobody on this show possess the ability to act like their empty prop cup is full? It's especially bad with the paper coffee cups. They're just waving them around and it's completely obvious that the cup is empty because anyone who has ever gotten any hot drink to-go in one of those cups KNOWS that they spill out the mouth hole annoyingly easily, and that shit is hot! Come on, actors! I KNOW you've had Starbucks before!

* **The Dance Marathon episode.** That episode had so many lazy plot flaws I don't even know where to begin. How about when it's like 4 in the morning and Dave tells Mrs. Kim that his parents are at Bible Study? How does that even make sense? Or how Lorelai didn't just take her shoe off when it broke since there's was less than an hour left? And how did she miss the Rory/Dean/Jess argument? She never left the gymnasium, did she? She just sat down on the bleachers to wait for Luke to fix her shoe!

* **Emily's feelings about Luke and Lorelai.**  Remember in season 1 when Emily tells Lorelai that Luke likes her? And she called both her and Luke idiots for not knowing it? What about when she was talking about her wedding theme idea for Lorelai, and asks Luke how he feels about the Romanovs? So it's pretty safe to assume that she at least doesn't mind the idea of Luke and Lorelai together, right? But then in season 5 when they're dating, suddenly the idea of them together or getting married is deplorable? What changed? What changed between asking Luke how he felt about the Romanovs and then freaking out when Lorelai was holding one of the wedding dresses up in the mirror?


Another thing that bothers me, although it's not necessarily a plot flaw, is when Emily is telling Christopher to come to her vow renewal to get back with Lorelai or whatever, and she's complaining about how Luke ""isn't a suitable stepfather for Rory"". I'm like, bitch, Rory is an adult. That stepfather argument doesn't even make sense. It's not like she's still young and being taken care of by parental figures; Luke wouldn't be her stepfather. My dad remarried when I was 21. That lady is not my stepmom, I'm a grown adult. She's just my dad's wife.

I have to say... I'm having a hard time seeing why everyone hates the season so much.

I think they really did get the voices of the characters down. 

Emily was classic, in her finest form in the hospital. Also the road trip, with the scheming and being petty to hide that she's feeling vulnerable.

Paris was marvelous with the schedule and her conversations regarding her career and Doyle were really insightful. They captured her and Doyle very well, and they're adorable. Also, the feminism class taught her to be ruthless to other women because there are only a few spots at the top? That's a great line.

Edit: Rory's ""No toast tomorrow. Sad"" line was SO Season 1-3 Rory. It was cute.

Hay Bale Maze was a great townie episode. Taylor being Taylor, funny Zack. And ""Poor little scab nose"" is so adorable I could die. Karaoke was also a great townie highlight and one of the only scenes in which I like Kirk (sorry, I know he's popular but I don't like him).

And not to mention, Lor's karaoke scene was wonderful - turning it from a sappy, cheesy song to her daughter to serenading Luke- God, Lauren Graham's acting/singing is just off the charts there.

Logan has a really great and very realistic arc for a Yale graduate at that time. I won't go to much into him because I don't want this to turn into a boyfriends battle. But the You Belong to Me- Good Weird convo? So cute. 

The dialog is funny, in character, and I don't understand the criticism that the references were too new. Maybe that's in earlier episodes I didn't watch? I saw good, semi-obscure references. I actually laughed out loud at a few points.

Moreover, I think some parts are BETTER than ASP because they actually call out some of her stupidity!

* Paris is harsh about Rory getting into Harvard when she didn't
* Lorelai talks about Rory always getting what she wants, and that everything came easily for her
* Luke talks about how his approach to April and Lorelai made no sense, and provides decent reasons why he might have done it

Anyway, it was beautiful. The only part I really didn't like was the proposal and breakup scene. Logan KNOWS she's a pro-con list person. She can't just jump. And you would never end a long term, serious relationship with ""uh, bye"" -- I excuse this as just bad, rushed plot because they had to get Logan out of the way for the finale.

So that's my defense of the second half of Season 7. The first half has some majorly annoying episodes, but I really think they got into the swing of it by the end.",29,23,False,self,,,,,

Having completed the first season i can now say i am a definite fan, there's a great comforting feeling associated with watching the show, that i chock up to the relatively low stakes and the genuine delightfulness of the characters. Gilmore Girls is like the chicken noodle soup of television shows, and i mean that in the best way possible.

Anyways, **i've made this post to share some of my general thoughts about the show and its characters in the bulletproof list that follows:**

* Lauren Graham imo, is pretty much the best thing about the show so far, acting wise she can do it all, and the character of Lorelai is the cheery loveable heart of the show

* When it comes to the character of Rory i'm a bit less infatuated with, she's a sweet and wonderful young girl, however, i'm not sure if it's the acting of a young Alexis Bledel or something else, but she's a little boring. Which i suppose is inevitable compared to the character of Lorelai, and to be fair Rory's lack of a wild side is a key part of the formula.

* I don't know if this will be blasphemous or a popular opinion, but Emily Gilmore may just be my favourite character on the show. I love Lorelai's complex relationship with her parents, and for whatever reason i often find myself sympathizing with Emily, she's a woman who clearly has the capacity for coldness and tyranny, but i can't help but see her as a loving and caring mother who has trouble being so in an outright manner. Her relationship with Lorelai may be my favourite aspect of the show.

* The character of Luke is also a favourite of mine so far, i'm digging the will they won't they vibe between him and Lorelai so far, i'm just hoping the show doesn't jump the shark by putting them together too quickly or doing nothing but teasing it for the length of the show. I honestly wouldn't mind if their relationship just ends up being a Don/Peggy or Liz Lemon/Jack Donaghy kinda thing, although i believe there's more in the way of actual romantic feelings between Lorelai and Luke than those other two cases.

* Other miscellaneous characters i'm fond of include Patty, Babette and her husband, Sookie in all her adorableness, Kirk, as well as Tristan and Paris

* My favourite episode from season one was definitely episode 6 ""Rory's Birthday Parties"", it was a great showcase for all the main characters, in particular it did a great job of exploring the different facets of all the Gilmore Girls, Emily included. The moment when Emily and Richard show up to Rory's party was incredibly touching, and a great showcase of Emily's caring side which i'm soo fond of.

Those are my general thoughts, i could say more but i figured i should keep this post only moderately lengthy, feel free to tell me how stupid my opinions are and/or disagree vehemently, i'm open to discussion.

New technologies and social media finally arrived in stars hollow. I thought it would be fun to think about, who would use social media and how. 

* I think Rory would use twitter and use it for professional reason and tweets mostly about politics and article recommendations. 

* Lorelai would be a fun instagram girl, posting occasionally about weird things that happen to her and paul anka.

* Sookie would also use instagram to share her meals and her love for food. Maybe she even tries snapchat but while snapping, her phone would fall into a soup or something. 

* Taylor would try different types of social media to promote the town and several events. Mostly Instagram and other visual media to attract tourists. 

* Lane would be a great youtube personality. I think she would use the plattform to talk about music and maybe share her rock'n'roll family lifestyle. 

* Luke would use the same phone he bought back in season 6 (?) and complain about people who just stare at their smartphones. I think someone here even shared a new sign saying ""no smartphones"".

A few minutes ago I found this house in Pasadena that looks exactly like the exterior they used for the house, at least in Season 1. It's particularly noticeably in S01E16.

It's located at 293 S Grand Avenue, Pasadena, California. I think they definitely used this for exterior footage until they built the soundstage and possibly also for interior shots but I couldn't find any pictures.

* Based on the two-minute clip of winter (does anyone have a link to the actual video?), Rory has just returned to SH having lived and worked in London.

* Costume designer, Brenda Maben, hinted that at least at the start of the revival Logan is successful and living in London. Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxqjNcLTtRw). She talks about Logan at about the 3:00 minute mark.
* Rory starts off the revival dating a gent named Paul, but they break up sometime in winter.

It wouldn't be a reach to assume then that Paul is English and their break-up combined with Richard's death, and her meh journalism career propels her back home to Stars Hollow. What I can't figure out is how Logan plays into this. Do they reconnect in London? Does he follow her back to the states? Does Herr Huntzberger call upon the prodigal son's return on the twilight of Sr. Huntzberger's looming retirement? 

Because news is slow and waiting 118 days for answers is killing me, let's read way too much into what little info we have. And Go. :)

I'm back again because i think some of you guys got a kick out of it reading a newbies impression of the show, so without further ado, here are some of my scrambled thoughts on S2:

* My first thought is that **I definitely enjoyed S2 more than the first**, which may have simply to do with exposure increasing my fondness for the show

* **My favourite episode of this season was The Road Trip to Harvard**, it was a wonderful little retreat from the usual Stars Hollow affair but also helped give great insight into the characters of Rory and Lorelai, it reminded me a lot of the Mad Men episode the The Jet Set, in that it was a retreat for the characters in a new location, surrounded by new people, allowing us to examine them in a new way and learn something about them.

* Interestingly enough **the episode is a product of what I found to be an all to abrupt end to the Max Medina storyline**, I was never really a fan of Max, and I suppose the signs were always there of the relationship not working out, but I found the panicky break up perhaps a little contrived, although to be fair I suppose Lorelai has always been shown to be impulsive.

* Before I move on to Jess **I have to mention how choked I was to see Tristan go**, I dont know if the actor found another job or if the character was always meant to exit like that, but I had really been looking forward to Tristan becoming the Spike of the show, in that hed go from a villain to a loveable ally

* **It almost seems to me like the character of Jess was brought in as a sort of surrogate for Tristan**, another cute jerk that foils Dean and can vie for Rorys affection.

* Having just finished the season **I still havent made up my mind on whether or not I like Jess**, he may be a little too Holden Caulfield for me, the reason I think I liked Tristan almost immediately was because I believed his character could exist so maybe its an acting issue for me when it comes to Jess, either way, what I do know is that **Rory and Jess both become far more interesting for me when they interact with each other**, they have a great chemistry.

* With Jess arrival **I think the clock is ticking for Dean**, Im interested to see how the love triangle plays out though

* It was also **cool to see Lorelai and Lukes relationship develop**, the teeing up of that relationship was in full force early on in the season, as evidenced by the lingering shot of them standing under the chuppa together. I also think the fight between them over Jess and the crash leaves their relationship in an interesting place that I continue to look forward to play out.

* **Christopher also had more of a presence this season and I enjoy his character**, I think I like them better as cordial exes and loving parents than a potential couple, and I think Chris unexpected child should make for a very interesting turn for his character and relationship with Lorelai and Rory.

* Ive also **loved the continued development of Paris and her relationship with Rory**, the shows done a great job of making them slowly acclimate to each other and I really enjoy seeing the two of them interact, I think theyre another pair where the sum is greater than its parts.

* Id also like to add that **Kirk went from amusing in S1 to probably my favourite side character in S2**, his short film was brilliant and he never fails to delight.

* In terms of the other characters, **Emily is still my favourite** with Lorelai coming up close behind, I really enjoyed their spa retreat and I love watching their relationship develop, Richard also had a great arc this season with his retirement, listlessness and new career, and Sookie and Jackson are great together, though I kinda miss their shouting matches.

* Also a side thought, but **I realized its called the Independence Inn because its a monument to Lorelais independence**. I think one of the strongest themes of the show has been Lorelais independence and its particularly prevalent in her relationship with her parents, her job at the inn stands as a testament to her self-sufficiency.  On the theme of independence it makes me think that perhaps Lorelai wont end up hitched with anyone at all by shows end, however, if she does, it would have to be with someone who respects and allows her to maintain her independence.

If you made it through all that congratulations, feel free to share your thoughts and comments...

I loved that one scene of her in that overcrowded classroom, all of them in their own clothes, Rory the only one actually working. I think Rory would have stayed more like Rory if she'd stayed at SHH. Emily and Richard could still be involved, maybe there's an issue with Lorelai's house (like with the termites) and she might lose it, so she goes to them so she can keep Rory in her home, with Friday night dinners as the payment. Emily and Richard wouldn't approve of SHH, they'd offer to pay for private school, which Lorelai would refuse, so they'd try to get her a tutor, then they'd try and donate a load of money to SHH which would embarrass Rory...

Rory trying to get into an ivy league school would have so much more meat to it if she had stayed there. And when she got in there would be a contrast between her public school and this fancy university where most people went to private school.

Imagine the Jess/Dean/Rory situation if they all went to the same school!

Dean pounds on the door, and explain that he's actually the one named ""Dean"" and that the boy they knew as ""Dean"" is actually ""Sam"".

Lorelei invites Dean in, and before you know it, they are really hitting it off big time; Rory, meanwhile, goes outside to the car, to hover over Sammy as he sleeps.

""Wake up, mister!"" exclaims Rory, bored and eager to catch up on old times.

Sam awakes with a jolt and can't believe what he's seeing - he is once again in Star's Hollow, and there, looking lovelier than ever, is Rory Gilmore.

""Uh....hi. Rory. Yeah, uh...great to see you again - how have you been""?

""Not bad. Would have been nice if you would have called or emailed to keep in touch.....SAM."", replied Rory.

""Uh, yeah, about that...I...""

""It's ok. Let's go in the house and have some cookies and cappuccinos!"" said Rory in her cute-as-a-button voice.

Sam smiled whimsically - ""Yeah, why don't we do that?""

Inside the house, the living room was empty, but there was a great deal of laughing and grunting upstairs, along with the sound of the headboard of a bed banging against the wall.

""You'll have to forgive my brother, he's.....uh...""

""A MILF-chasing hottie?"" replied Rory as she handed Sam his cappuccino.

""I was going to go with ""idiot"" ' replied Sam.

Dean then came halfway down the stairs, wrapped in a blanket and sweating, also out of breath.

""Hey, Sammy boy, I can see what you saw in dese Gilmore Girls, Lorelei is one hot, bangin' MILF!""

Sam frowned and looked to his brother - ""Dean, could you BE any more.....*immature*??!?!?""

""Don't mind if I DO, Sammy!"" replied Dean as he then proceeded to let out a loud expression of flatulent gas.

Just then, an semi-elderly, tall man with glasses entered the home.

""Grandpa!"" exclaimed Rory, as she rushed to hug him.

""Hello, dear. And who, pray tell, is *this* man on the stairs?""

Dean smiled and introduced himself - ""Sir, I am Dean Winchester, the man who has just taken your daughter to Heaven and back!""

""This won't do. No, this won't do at all."" replied Richard Gilmore.
""I was planning on a feast, you see. A big feast of the blood of my offspring, and perhaps her offspring....until *you* contaminated her with your session of ""whoopie"".'

Richard then turned his gaze toward his granddaughter, still in his arms.

His fast then distorted, and a large pair of fangs became visible from his upper mouth.

""But I still want *YOU*, Rory - I haven't changed my mind about *that*!""

Everyone screamed, until a blinding light blasted Richard's body into a million pieces.

When the smoke dissipated, a dark haired main in a Khaki-colored trenchcoat could be seen.

""Have no fear, for I am an Angel of the Lord.""

Dean smiled.

""Good friggin' save there, Cas - good lookin' out buddy - why don't you help yourself to some beer in da fridge while I take my lady Lorelei for round two of a blissful roll in da hay with yours truly?""
