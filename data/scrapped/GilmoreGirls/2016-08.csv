For her own sake? Outside of school. And I dont mean her apparently meticulous diary entries where she jots down what she had for breakfast. I mean the way most aspiring writers/authors write throughout their childhood. Perhaps bedtime stories as a child. Short stories or even attempts at novels as she grows older. A play which she and Lane then perform for Lorelai. Or, more relevant to her childhood dream: her own little newspaper created at home. Why did we never hear cute stories about little reporter Rory stalking the streets of Stars Hollow with a notepad and pen in her hand, looking for a scoop? Or sitting in the movie theater to review a movie? Or asking Miss Patty for an in-depth interview about her background in show biz and how that affects her teaching dance classes in a small town? And so on. Lbr, Stars Hollow wouldve been perfect for that. They wouldve all indulged her and found it adorable. They wouldve bought those bits of papers neatly stapled together and read them together over a cup of coffee at Lukes.

And why didnt she have a blog once the internet took off?

To me, Rorys a reader, a researcher, an info dumper, and an organizer. The constant student whose passion is school and learning and possibly even teaching. But a writer? She doesnt behave as though thats her passion. Sure, she can still be good at it, but its not believable to me that shes dreamed of it all her life but only ever written for school projects.

I've got to to say that of the most beautiful endings to a comedy i have ever seen it was just right. The series was so lovable with the great Romance between Luke and Lorelai and the multitude of wonderful and colorful supporting characters my favorites being the ever crazy Paris and Emily Gilmore. The fast paced and witty but colorful dialogue had me an addict from the get go. I just saw the finale so i just want to talk about it, how did this not win an emmy!

I think my favorite episode has to be that one episode where Luke started reading a self help book on love and Jess get hooked on to it too. So in dorkly fashion Uncle and Nephew are both reading the book where by the book actually helps the two get closer in the end.

I just want to talk about it some more! I can't agree a lot of the weird choices Rory makes later in the series like that weird flinger relationship with Logan or that weird second relationship with Dean. So saddened that a lot of the show's best talents were taken away by more exciting roles i'm still wondering what would had happened if Dave Rylgaski, Dean and Jess stayed around... Specially Dave Ryglaski. Also Tristan's departure was really weird and was it just me or did Logan feel kinda feel like a Tristan version 2 like they said yep Tristan is not what we wanted to be so we'll make a better Tristan. I really love that the show left off with Rory and Logan break up i never saw that coming and leaves a lot up in the air. I wish we could had ended the show with a wending between Mr and Mrs Danes...

She is a character that does bad things but we forgive or justify their actions because we understand and sympathise with why they make their choices. Or just because they're so entertaining.

Emily is always plotting and scheming and making thoughtless remarks to Loralei. But she's entertaining. She is just as quick witted and sassy as Loralei. And whenever there's a dramatic moment, Kelly Bishop just kills it. 

It's okay to like her. She is great. She loves her family so much but she expresses it in a bad way. She measures love in how much you spend. She's brutally honest to her daughter even though it's obvious that it hurts her. But she still won't actually talk. She doesn't trust Loralei to tell her anything. She gets a spy in her granddaughter's school. 

When she finds out Rory is having sex with Logan, she doesn't talk about it. She doesn't say anything to Rory. She doesn't so much as slip her a pamphlet. She invites a priest to dinner and moves her out of the pool house, then shadows her constantly. Rory was an adult. She was 21. Her motivation was understandable. They were based on outdated principles, but what she did, she did out of love.

But what she did was wrong. 

If you really love Emily, you have to admit her flaws. Flaws are what legitimize a character. They are their obstacles. No one is perfect. 

She may never have poisoned a child. But I've never met a Walter White fan who denied that he ever did anything wrong.

Emily is a character that does bad things but we forgive her because we understand why. But we shouldn't ignore when she is wrong",18,29,False,self,,,,,

They only lived a few blocks away, anyway. 

It was great for the storyline to show Rory was in a different place in her life than Dean. However, I could have seen the Rory and Dean relationship going a lot further if Dean didn't move out. They would have had a place to spend time together. Also, if Dean was alone, I could have seen him working hard on his own or even Rory encouraging him to go back to school. 

I'm not necessarily team Dean but it would have been fascinating to see where the relationship could have gone or what Dean could have evolved into.

How much they personally fancy him. Chemistry with Rory. What she is like in his company. How he treats her. And so on. But all that is subjective and Im trying to put on my objective glasses and look at this from a more technical point of view.

Around the internet, Jess generally seems to be the most popular boyfriend. And I cant help but wonder how much the shows treatment of the three men as *individual characters* affects who the majority likes the most. 

Deans introduced as the new kid in town. As far as I can remember, he has no other ties to Stars Hollow. We see him interacting with the Gilmore girls (or someone close to them), or see him interacting with others through a Gilmore girls POV. But how often do we see Dean being the star of his own story? Off the top of my head, I can only remember the pot roast scene with a bouncing Lindsay, which does more to humanize her than him. This means Deans constantly viewed through a Gilmore lens, so he has no natural place in the show when he no longer has a relationship with Rory. That makes him dispensable to the average viewer.

Logans introduced in college. He seemingly has no ties to Stars Hollow and only exists in the show because of Rory. And while he possibly get the most screen time, hes the one we see Rory having a grown up relationship with, and we get to know his family, do we ever get Logan scenes where he *doesnt* interact with a Gilmore or Gilmore friend? And this is not a rhetorical question. Please help me out here. When he got the news about losing all that money, was that an isolated scene or did he get a call with Rory in the room or similar? Either way, Im not sure one or even two scenes are enough to give him an obvious place in the show. If hes no longer a love interest for Rory, theres no point in keeping him on. Just as there was no point in having Alex or Jason being regulars once the relationships with Lorelai ended. Like with Dean, this makes Logan dispensable to the average viewer.

And then we have Jess. He arrives to Stars Hollow, the town where his mother grew up, because of Luke. We see him having scenes with Luke where the show cultivates a relationship between the two. Later on, because ASP wanted to create a spinoff for Jess, we even see him going to see his father. The few times after that he returns to the show, its not purely to see Rory. He walks his mother down the aisle at her wedding. And he meets Luke and April, his cousin, in Philadelphia. Regardless of whether he ever gets back with Rory, he has a natural place in the show because of Luke and Liz and could be brought back repeatedly and indefinitely without any scenes with Rory at all. This could subconsciously make Jess feel more permanent to the average viewer, which humanizes him and possibly makes him easier to like, warts and all. Because humans generally understand and forgive someone when they feel connected to them. Just like how the average viewer likes Emily, but doesnt like Mitchum even though theyre similar characters, because they get very different treatments.

Again, this isnt about who you personally prefer. Its not even about shipping. Its more about the writing of an intricate show and the plethora of characters therein, and how that resonates with viewers in *general* (how an *individual* responds to the writing isnt important in this context). And while I don't believe this is the main reason why people like him, I do believe it could be a contributing factor.

The following wall of text contains my opinions and thoughts regarding the 3rd season:

 **This was the best season of the show so far for me**, there were a number of fantastic episodes, it had some of the best character growth and story arcs, and overall felt like a culmination of the entire show up to this point.

 Speaking of the season in general **I love how it wrapped up many storylines from the very beginning of the show**, such as, Rorys graduation from Chilton and Lorelais big move to owning her own inn.

 I had a number of favourite episodes this season, namely, Dear Emily and Richard, The Big One, and of course the finale Those Are Strings, Pinocchio

 **The flashback scenes in Dear Emily and Richard were such great insights into Lorelais past**, it helped drive home Lorelais individuality and independence from day one, and I think what prompted Lorelai on her path to becoming a self-sufficient business manager and terrific single-mom was the wake-up call of responsibility that was Rorys birth. I found it interesting that in her flashback scenes the first time young Lorelai seems sure or confident about anything at all in her life was the moment she claims Rory is perfect. **Motherhood seemed to unlock the hidden potential in Lorelai** to succeed at anything she put her mind to.

 Apart from the flashbacks I loved the interactions between Lorelai and Emily in this episode, I think it helped me understand what I find so compelling about their relationship. **I think Lorelai and Emily have great love for each other but ultimately suck at communicating it with one another**. Whether it be Emily bribing Lorelai into weekly dinners or Lorelai buying Emily a dvd player because the thought of Emily being sad and lonely depresses her, I think these are both examples of one of them essentially saying Im doing this because I love you while the other fails to understand. I think theyre both stubborn people and pride/mistrust often gets in the way of affection. I think Rorys going to college will hopefully allow Emily and Lorelai to understand each other better, I love and am fascinated by their relationship and I look forward to seeing it develop.

 I really enjoyed The Big One because it was such a great episode for Paris, **I was always fond of Paris through the first 2 seasons, but her development this season made her one of my favourite characters in the show**. I think it was a great move by the writers to show us Paris unhinged, it made sense that her harsh demeanor would end up biting her in the ass, and it was nice to see Paris exhibit self-awareness throughout the season, particularly when she admitted to being too unlikeable to win the presidency on her own, and when she was able to realize her personality may have cost her admission to Harvard. 

 And of course **the finale was a great cap to the 3 seasons preceding it**, as previously mentioned, I think the show did a great job of closing out storylines like Rorys time at Chilton and Lorelais quest for her own inn, it really feels like S4 is going to be the beginning of a whole new show, I also really liked how the season was bookended with Lorelais dream in the premier and Lukes dream in the finale, the show is still having fun teasing their relationship. I found it interesting how Lorelai and Lukes romantic exploits this season were so much more about their relationship with one another than with the person they were seeing. Lastly, Rorys valedictorian speech was really touching and made for a great moment.

 **Paris relationship with Rory was one of my favourite aspects of this season**, and I love that Paris has such a hard time trusting Rory as a friend; its a tragic part of her character but also incredibly humanizing. Some of their heart to heart moments were really touching and made me grow appreciation for both Paris and Rory. I really hope Paris ends up going to Yale with Rory and their relationship continues to develop, itd be sad if this was the last we got to see of her.

 **I also really enjoyed the growth of Rory this year**, I was always kinda lukewarm on her but her aforementioned relationship with Paris and greater signs of her independence have made me appreciate her more. I particularly love that Rory maintains relationships with Christopher, Emily and Richard even when they are at odds with her mother. 

 **I think Rorys relationship with her grandparents is incredibly sweet**, I imagine that relationship allows for Emily and Richard to be affectionate in a manner perhaps they werent with Lorelai, and I think Rory is partly just a people pleaser but also sees it as an opportunity to bridge the perceived gap between Lorelai and them, if everyone else is too stubborn I love the fact that Rory can soo often be the diplomatic third party. **I also loved how the writers blindsided us with the Yale decision**, I like the idea that although her aspiration was always to end up at Harvard, after thoughtfully reviewing her options she chose Yale, it showed great maturity and also kept alive my hope that Paris and Rory can go to the same college.

 **I thought Rorys breakup with Dean was handled well by the writers**, I enjoyed the fact that it was Dean who finally pulled the plug on the relationship, Rory was clearly infatuated with Jess and it was interesting to see her be in the wrong.

 Speaking of, **I thought Jess was much more charming this season than the last**, his relationship with Rory was far more interesting than Dean and Rory ever were, they both made each other more interesting, however, I thought Jess most compelling relationship was his with Luke, particularly because it gave us great insight into Lukes character.

 **Jess and Lukes constant bickering and failure to communicate added a lot of depth to both characters**, ultimately I think Jess departure made me feel really sad for both Luke and Jess, I think Luke probably saw it as a failure on his part to properly mentor the kid, while I think Jess is probably in for more heartbreak. I do hope however we get to see more of Jess, though I can also see this being where his story ends.

 **Looking to S4 Im really curious to see if Rorys absence will factor into Lorelais story or not**, I mean, I know the show has given the indication that Rory will be visiting often, but I think Lorelai having a dash of empty nest syndrome would make for a good storyline especially if it means further development of her relationship with Emily, I also look forward to Rorys continued maturation in college, more Luke and Lorelai teasing and the new inn.

First of all, when I first started watching Bunheads I really didn't like it. I thought the original premise was unbelievable, and that turned me off, especially compared to the simple premise of Gilmore. But as Bunheads went on and the universe grew, I began to love it. Part of that however, is because I think it got much more similar to Gilmore. 
Secondly, what about the characters compared? I thought the main characters in Gilmore seemed much more like real people, especially the teenagers in Gilmore. And what did you think of the characters of the actors in both? I thought pretty much all of them were cast in very similar roles to their Gilmore counterparts.

It's hard to gain fan girls being the post-Dave boyfriend, seeing as Dave Rygalski was basically perfect. And yes, early Zack was kinda lame and annoying (although the scene when he flirts with Lorelai makes me laugh every time), but after Adam Brody left, his character began to gain so much depth.

While he's definitely a ladies man in season 4, I don't think the Lane/Zack romance came out of nowhere. Remember the scene at the end of 4.19 (I think?) right after Hep Alien performs and both Brian and Gil have left the stage? There's definitely a moment. The following episodes show Lane becoming jealous without really realizing why, until she finally has some help in the form of one of Zack's female friends.

When the two first start dating, it's a little awkward, so I didn't really begin to like them as a couple until Mrs. Kim yells at Zack (a classic moment). Another prime pre-break up scene is when Mrs. Kim and Zack discuss Lane's lack of glasses (and for those accusing him of being shallow in the diner when he says they make her look smart? That's the first thing Mrs. Kim says about them too. ""I like your glasses. They make you look smart."") This also serves to show how awesome Mrs. Kim and Zack are when they share scenes.

Zack's fit on stage at the gig - I don't like to acknowledge this because I blame it on the writers, not the character. He may have a temper, but certainly nothing like this. It's just a really awkward moment that leads to a breakup. The breakup, however, includes another two great scenes with Mrs. Kim (honestly one of my favorites) - the scene with Zack at the festival (""I will NOT get in your way!""), and the alcohol scene with Lane.

Post-reconciliation Zack gets better and better each episode. The wedding episode is one of my top five. Although the honeymoon was terrible, I do think they ended up having sex again - when they started making out after talking about how worried they were about the baby and how much it sucked? Yeahhh.. That was getting a little hot and heavy. This could also explain the shared look when they talk about how wine and sex can induce labor in season 7.

Season 7 is rough. But the relationships between Lane and Zack, Zack and Mrs. Kim, and Zack and Luke definitely help. Lane is still really BA, and Zack is always super sweet to her. He offers to buy her pantyhose, and while that may seem trivial, it's a lovely moment. I can totally see Zack and Mrs. Kim hanging out much more than we're shown, and I have a head canon that they end up writing loads of new music for Hep Alien. Luke becomes the father figure to yet another Stars Hollow youth, and these two have some awesome scenes in the diner when Zack is freaking out about being a dad. In addition, Zack and Rory seem to have a nice friendship now - much better than when she briefly stayed in the apartment and used too much paper towel. Obviously these are only a few great moments - watch seasons six and seven for many more.

While not the smartest, Zack becomes one of the sweetest significant others on the show. He really loves Lane, and was ready to turn down the tour at the end of the show because his family couldn't come. Lane was the one who told him to do it anyway, and I'm positive he would have stayed home had she asked him. He's shown to be a hard worker at Luke's, is a great guitarist, and overall deserves more love. Let's hope the revival brings back more Hep Alien and Van Gerbig family moments - we can celebrate with name brand chips and silent foot stomping.

If anyone has agreeing or conflicting thoughts, please share them - I'd love to hear what you think!

You can find my previous discussions on the first three seasons in the list below:

* 
[Season 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/4ulxk4/just_finished_season_1_for_the_first_time/)
* [Season 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/4vdtpk/just_finished_season_2_for_the_first_time/)
* [Season 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/4vzox3/just_finished_season_3_for_the_first_time/)

Following are my long-winded thoughts on the fourth season:

	With many plot points and arcs felt resolved at the end of S3 **this season did a great job of launching the show into a new chapter**. Overall, I really enjoyed the new direction, the show felt a bit more mature, and definitely a bit more dark. 


	**I particularly loved the distinct and compelling story arcs for all three Gilmore girls this season**. Namely, Rorys adjustment to college life and the independence that comes along with it, Lorelais struggles with an empty nest, new business and secret relationship, and Emilys struggles with becoming obsolete.


	**I love how all three generations of Gilmores represent different stages and struggles of womanhood**; **Emily stands as a symbol of the antiquated housewife**, destined to host cocktail parties and straighten her husbands bowtie, **her frustration with and rejection of this fate has only made my appreciation for Emily grow** and Im really glad the writers pursued this storyline for her character, not only does it carry a strong feminist sentiment, its also a character arc I havent seen in any other tv show, making Emily all the more compelling.

	**Lorelai on the other hand I feel represents the modern day woman or the strong single-mother prototype**, her ability to balance motherhood, a business and love life make her a sort of feminist role model. Yet despite being a paragon of independence, we see Lorelai struggle in her many roles and crave a shoulder to lean on. I find it interesting how **both Emily and Lorelai occupy very different roles in their daily lives, and yet both search for something more.**


	**Rory finally I believe represents the young woman with limitless potential**, with an ivy-league education behind her and several role models in her life, Rorys future is still unwritten, she might be able to have a bit more than her mother or grandmother ever did. The varied identities of the three Gilmores were very present this season, making for a compelling spectrum of womanhood.

	**My favourite episode of this season was The Incredible Sinking Lorelais**, it really delivered on the front of Lorelai and Rory struggling to carry on without each other, their relationship is focus of the show and their many missed connections this episode helped accentuate their need for one another. While I love the characters its always compelling to see them struggle, this episode did a great job of establishing how the Gilmores are struggling with their newfound independence.

	**I thought Rorys arc was well done this season, we see her struggle to adjust to college life early on, even confessing to being a mommas girl, but she manages to survive her first year, and ends the season making her most adult decision yet**. About the decision to sleep with Dean, I find it interesting that while Rory gives off a very straight and narrow image, shes clearly inherited some of her mothers impulsiveness, not that its Lorelais fault that Rory slept with a married man, but I think her impulsive decision to do so isnt unlike something a young Lorelai may have done once. If anything Rorys occasional screw-ups make her a much more compelling character.


	On the same topic, **I found Dean to be a pretty tragic character this season**, hes still infatuated with Rory even though she pretty much just got bored of him and he probably screwed up his marriage by sleeping with her, although the marriage always seemed like a desperate ill-advised attempt to move on. Also, Deans lovesickness when it came to Dean this season was kinda tiresome and pathetic, my favourite Dean moment was when he broke up wit Rory, and the Dean we see in this season seemed to have far less self-respect.

	**Lorelai was particularly exasperated this season** with the construction of the inn underway and her secret relationship with Jason. Overall, I found Jason to be kind of douchey, but he and Lorelai did have good banter. That relationship seemed like an enormous exercise in patience and will for Lorelai, it seemed doomed from the start given how hectic Lorelais life was at the time.

	**Luke also had himself a very hectic season**, between his confusing and difficult relationship with Nicole and the eventual arrival of his sister and her problems. I enjoyed that we got to uncover more of his character this season with a lot of stories focusing solely on him.

	**The arcs of Luke and Lorelai seemed to parallel each other in this way**; they both seemed swamped by life with work, obligations, and relationships requiring too much effort. 


	**Their parallel storylines made their eventual kiss at the end of the season a very satisfying beginning to their long-teased relationship**, I think the writers gave us a pay-off at just the right time, that moment was definitely earned. I look forward to what comes from this now, I hope they can make a relationship work, and if it doesnt I hope they can remain cordial, because this show wont be the same without that classic Luke and Lorelai banter.

	**Jesss brief return was very welcome and I almost forgot how entertaining his interactions with the people of Stars Hollow were**. I still for the most part enjoyed his interactions with Luke the best and Im glad they reached a mutual respect for each other, I hope we get to see more Jess appearances in the future. 

	**I was also a fan of Lane and Mrs. Kims showdown this season, it was nice to see both those characters get so much to work with this season**. I felt really bad for Lane who has always tried to live up to her mothers expectations, and I even kinda felt sympathetic to Mrs. Kim, who embodies the immigrant parent that struggles to identify with their culturally alien offspring. I feel that Lane and Mrs. Kims relationship serves as a foil to the Gilmores and the great communication they have, I hope the two of them can reach some kind of understanding as hard as it may be.


	**Im also just generally glad that Kirk is getting more and more screentime**, Im glad he found a girlfriend and I find his budding relationship with Luke incredibly endearing.


	Finally Id like to mention if I havent already how insanely talented Lauren Graham is, Emily may be my favourite character, but **Lauren Graham is the undisputed MVP of this show**, the character of Lorelai is fantastic and she makes every other character on the show instantly entertaining just by interacting with them.",26,44,False,self,,,,,

Don't get me wrong, she still has flaws, as everybody, but the Rory in season 7 is a grown up version of the Rory in the first seasons. Season 5 and 6 went a bit too far with her in my opinion, she truly became an insufferable character and aggravated the series too much.

It's a great Emily episode and I can't help but think it might be some foreshadowing of how Emily's life would be now without Richard. And how sad she was when he was only in the pool house.

Emily: You have a lot of experience with men. How do you let them know that you're available?
Lorelai: Well, one of those bench ads usually does the trick.
Emily: Lorelai, stop it. I need help here. It's been years since I did this and I don't remember the proper procedure. Now take me through this step by step. You see a man, you walk up to him, and you say...
Lorelai: ""Hello.""
Emily: Is that too forward?
Lorelai: No, it's the appropriate way to indicate you're open to a social engagement. Unless, however, you are approaching a weasel. Then I believe the proper signal is just to offer him your hindquarters.

And

Emily: I have no idea what to put on. I'm in a blind panic, and it's all your fault.
Lorelai: How is it my fault?
Emily: Because I used your line and it worked.
Lorelai: What line?
Emily: ""Hello.""
Lorelai: ""Hello"" is not my line. ""Hello"" is not a line. ""Hello"" is hello.
Emily: Well, all I know is I hello-ed him today, and now he's taking me to dinner.

The following wall of text contains my thoughts and comments on season 5:

	I have a hard time summing this season up in a few sentences, it was a roller coaster ride, at times tumultuous and intense, there were lulls, relationships were hot and cold all over the place, and the drama seemed to be ramped up. **Overall, by seasons end, I found it to be a wonderfully unique and enjoyable season of Gilmore girls.**


	 **This season seemed more serialized than the ones before it, and I think this season more than the others should be judged as a whole rather than on an episode-to-episode basis.** It was a season of unexpected journeys for a lot of characters, whose story arcs took a lot of twists and turns.

	There were a number of episodes I really enjoyed this season particularly, Emily Says Hello, Women of Questionable Morals, Say Something, SoGood Talk, A House is Not a Home, but **Wedding Bell Blues takes the cake. The episode embodies the tension and drama at the surface of this season**, there was such great build-up to Richard and Emilys reunion and the way everyones plans and intentions collide, the ensuing drama and fallout from the events provides a great climactic moment and tees up a lot of the rest of the season.

	**I thought Rorys journey this season was one of the more complex and interesting**, we see her begin the season repeating old patterns, seeking some sort of familiar comfort by dating Dean, I think the brief rekindling of their relationship was done to tee-up the excitement of Logan, but it made the first chunk of episodes a drag, they were both clearly looking for something that wasnt there anymore. I do think however, that the Rory/Dean stuff that began the season did a good job to show how fun Logan was in contrast.

	**As for Logan, I like him**, he can be a bit arrogant, but given the kind of upbringing he mustve had, I cant really blame him, also, hes not soo arrogant as to lose his charm, which I think he has plenty of. I also like Logan from the perspective of Rorys arc, it makes sense that she would fall for a guy like him, hes a college boyfriend where Dean was a high school boyfriend if that makes any sense. Logan brings out a side of Rory that we havent seen much; he inspires her to be spontaneous. Also, I can see the Tristan comparison, but where Tristan wins for me is the vulnerability he shows in his affection for Rory, Logan seems to be too cool for that. 

	**As for him being a bad influence on Rory, I agree with that to the extent that Logan might inspire reckless behavior in Rory**, but as far as Im concerned, I dont think he encourages it. Much like the incident with Jess and the car crash, the yacht incident was largely Rorys fault, probably more so, yet those around her never see her as capable of such behavior, and perhaps theyre right to a certain degree, maybe Rory gets a bit starry-eyed and irresponsible when it comes to boys, it might be something she inherited from Lorelai. Logan also reminds me a bit of Christopher; I imagine thats what Chris mustve been like at Logans age.

	Getting back to Rory, while she has plenty of moments of being impulsive and childish, **I like that Rory often shows great courage and determination when it comes to protecting her mother**. For instance, I liked that Rory confronted Christopher and told him not to mess up things with Luke and Lorelai, I also enjoyed Rory being upset with her grandmother after the whole wedding debacle, Rory clearly ships Luke and Lorelai, and I enjoyed the protective and fierce side of her we got to see this season. 

	Of course as is often the case with Rory, shes bound to show her immaturity at times, **her erratic decision-making after being told she didnt have what it takes actually become a journalist came as a surprise to me**. I can understand her being unsure about the future, but I never imagined she would be so shaken up as to leave college, I suppose **I felt the same kind of astonishment that Lorelai was feeling at the end of the season**. I also find it interesting how the season was book ended by Rory and Lorelai once again being at odds after seemingly impulsive and irresponsible behavior. 

	**Emily also had a lot to do this season, personally I found her breakdown after her date to be incredibly heartbreaking**, I think she realized in that moment that her life was already incredibly precious, yes she may have felt in a rut before, but enough time had passed that she began missing Richard and the life they shared. I think the reason Emilys breakdown was soo out of character is exactly why I find her so compelling and sympathetic. 

	**Emily cant always express her feelings as wonderfully as Lorelai can, she has trouble with communication, I think its a symptom of being from an older generation**. Despite that fact, I think she cares about her family more than they often realize, her actions and words dont often paint the whole picture. Her intensity, strictness, nosiness, and passive aggression, while annoying, are signs that **she cares to the point of becoming a hassle, and maybe Im giving her too much credit, but thats how I understand the enigma that is Emily Gilmore, and I love her for it**.

	**I found Emily and Richards gradual reunion to be incredibly sweet**, they seemed young and in love again, finding any excuse they could to be together. As for their interactions with Luke I found them to be hilarious for the most part. **I do think the move Emily pulled with Christopher was pretty outrageous, however well intentioned, it was one of Emilys greatest transgressions in my eyes**, and I totally understand Lorelais and Rorys anger.  Having said that, **I also think it was brave of Emily to reach out to Luke and tell him to go back to her**, he may have said it made no difference, but I think it was the push he needed. Emily relenting and encouraging Luke like that is another one of those moments that makes me love her character, have I mentioned shes my favourite?

	As for the ending of the season, **I have to say Im confused as to why Emily and Richard suddenly decided to support Rorys listlessness**, I was pumped that Lorelai and her parents were finally sure about something and were going to join forces. Perhaps they took pity and some kind of parental instinct kicked in to support Rory, maybe theyre glad shes coming to them with her problems, I dont know but I hope t gets explained and explored, I just know Im as confused as Lorelai is right now.

	**I was super invested in Luke and Lorelai relationship this season**, despite my concerns of their dynamic growing stale by putting them together, I have to say I love their relationship and I enjoyed what the writers did with it this season. I was sad when the events of Richard and Emilys reunion tore them apart, but the episodes between that and their eventual reconciliation were some of the strongest of the season. They continue to have exceptional chemistry together, and their relationship in general just works so well for them, their personalities clash perfectly. 

	Also **the chuppa Luke made back when Lorelai was engaged to Max is still seen lingering in the background, its become a sort of Chekovs Chuppa**, I fully expect it to be used for their wedding by series end. **Lorelais proposal at the end of the season made a lot of sense to me, and I dont think shes rushing into it**, I think it was more of a matter of Lorelai realizing Luke is the partner she needs, shes always able to vent to him, hes always on her side, she was vulnerable in the moment, and I think she realized she always wanted Luke to be there. Its also interesting to note that this is the first time Lorelai has proposed marriage, she never wanted it with Christopher and the whole thing with Max was desperation on his part, but this proposal came from Lorelai, and at a time that seemed right. **It ended on a cliffhanger but I dont expect Luke to say anything other than yes.**

	**I also think I may have noticed a pink and blue motif running throughout the season**, I cant entirely be sure and I think a rewatch would help, but since Luke and Lorelais brief split and the passing out of pink and blue ribbons to the citizens of Stars Hollow, I started to notice a lot of pink and blue throughout the season from there on. The most prominent example being the garage which Lorelai paints half pink and half blue while still split from Luke, it suggested that they would eventually reconcile and share their lives. Also given pink and blues relation to maternity and Sookies pregnancy as well as Luke possibly wanting kids, those two colours really seemed to play a role this season.

	**Also Lorelais disdain/Emilys love of logan finally helped me notice how money, status, and class has been an issue of great divide between them**. For Richard and Emily wealth suggests worthiness, it means youre accomplished and responsible, and it means you can support yourself and the ones you love. They showered Lorelai with money growing up because they loved her, they provided for her in ways that perhaps they werent provided for by their parents. To Lorelai on the other hand, wealth represents arrogance, self-importance, and a means of control abused by her parents from her conception.

	 **Lorelais entire life has been a rejection of her parents money and support, her fierce independence is her greatest virtue, and money has only ever been a means to stifle that independence**, a way for her parents to bend her to their will. The dichotomy is evident in every facet of Lorelais life, from her diet to her fashion sense to the town in which she lives. Diner food, a colourful wardrobe, and Stars hollow all fly in the face of what her parents want for her and can provide her with, but to Lorelai, whats more important is that this life is hers, a result of her independence. In fact the series begins with Lorelai needing to ask her parents for money, shes hesitant because she believes shell owe them, that it means being susceptible to their control, and their happy because it means they can show their love and provide for their granddaughter, that Rory and Lorelai can be a part of their lives. **I think its an issue thats almost always at the center of any conflict between Lorelai and her parents**, and I think it really helps make sense of why Lorelais relationship with her parents has always been soo rocky. 

	**I also wanted to mention that Christopher is a great character**, the writers so often put him at the center of major events throughout the series and he always manages to remain believable and sympathetic, its also a credit to the actor, he always delivers when needed and is charming in the role. 

	**I also love Paris and Doyle together** theyre incredibly fun, and **Kirk never fails to crack me up, hes my favourite stars hollow resident.**",29,27,False,self,,,,,

I always thought that this was a writing decision as after the first season they decided they didn't want to get them together too quickly, and while I still think that was probably true, I actually think the turning point was when Lorelai told Luke she was engaged to Max. It seems like the moment where Luke officially gives up, and it's so subtle I hadn't even noticed it before, but it makes sense. Anyone agree with me?

I own all the seasons on DVD, and have done an annual rewatch since 2007. I considered calling my puppy Paul Anka. 

Obviously we all love the show! But is there one scene that reaaaallly rubs you up the wrong way? Is it way deep in your bogus bag and zip locked shut? And in a more positive light, what's your favourite scene? 

Favourite: when Rory tells the story of Skippy, the hamster that Lorelai abandons at the pet store. When she describes him with a pointy tail, a pitchfork and a cape, I always crack up. Or when Kirk dresses up as the woman of questionable morals. 

Least favourite: For me it's the scene where Rory flips out about not being able to find somewhere to study, and losing her study tree. She drives all the way back to Stars Hollow to have a whine to Lorelai and Sookie, then drives all the way back to Yale and finds a tree to study under. Theeeen someone else dares to sit under her special tree. Reading a trucking magazine, apparently. Rory tries to guilt him, then gives up and presumably GOES TO STUDY SOMEWHERE ELSE. (The next day she offers him $20 to give it up). Seriously, just study somewhere else. Go to a library. Find an empty classroom. Don't be a spoilt brat! 

Anyone else got any favourites and least favourites?

EDIT: Thanks so much for all of your awesome replies! I seriously spent all yesterday reading them and processing all of your opinions and perspectives. Had a weird dream last night where Rory lost her v-card to Jess in this teepee (sort of like Marissa and Ryan on The OC) and I was waaaaay more satisfied than when she lost it to Dean in her bed.

What follows is not only an analysis of the sixth season, but, a piece of myself, just kidding, but this wall of text is anything but dispassionate:

	Ok, so before I dive into trying to provide an analysis of this season, **I have to confess that Ive become emotionally invested into this show far beyond my expectations**. I compared the show to comfort food in my first post, a hearty bowl of chicken noodle-soup, but at this point my relationship has gone beyond the confines of a bowl of soup and encapsulated the dining table, the kitchen, and the entire house around it. 

	I think after finishing this season **I realized that I actually gave a shit about the characters and their relationships to the point that it actually affected my mood**. Thats a good thing ultimately; I suppose it means I care.

	**This season had some of my all-time favourite moments and some of my least favourite**, it was polarizing and frustrating, but it was also bold and brave of the writers to make the choices they did, and I believe the framework for those choices always existed, I just wanted to believe this show would make me laugh more than cry.

	**The elephant in the room thats the source of my agony is the deterioration of Luke and Lorelais relationship and the big mistakes made by both**, some possibly irreconcilable. Now that Ive sort of acknowledged it, Ill get to the other stuff and work my way back to this elephant.

	**I thought the early half of the season gave us some great material with Rorys relationship with her grandparents**. It was interesting to see Rory flounder the way she did, and struggle to find her identity and purpose. Her stint with the DAR was fun, and it helped give us a glimpse of Rory and Emily we havent seen before. Rorys entire arc living in the pool house kinda gave us an insight into what Lorelai probably had to deal with in her youth. 

	**Im glad that Richard finally realized that his arrangement wasnt doing much for Rorys progression**; I also found it interesting that Emily was always on board with Lorelais plan but only changed her mind because of Richard. **Seeing Emily and Richard finally realize how awful the Huntzbergers had been was awesome**, Richards confrontation with Mitchum displayed some great acting and was a badass moment for Richard, also Emilys dressing down of Logans mother was one of my favourite moments for her, she slayed that woman.

	Also **the reappearance of Jess was very welcome, it was fascinating to see how he got his life back together**, and the idea of him using writing as an outlet and publishing a book made a lot of sense to me, he always had a bit of an artistic temperament, he was self-destructive and angry at the world in the way that many great writers are, I imagine he wrote a pretty good book. His tension with Logan was fun, something about Jess just always makes Rorys boyfriends insecure and on guard, and I think it probably has something to do with the sexual tension they pick up on between the two. **I think out of all her boyfriends I enjoy Jess most as a character**, in the sense that if only one of them could be in the show at a time, Id pick Jess no question, he has had the most to work with in the show, and his character has meaningful relationships in the world of the show outside of Rory, his relationship with Luke being my favourite of his.  However, I think I prefer Jess and Rory as a potential couple rather than a real one, something about them being apart makes their interactions more alive, I had less fun seeing them actually coupled, unlike Luke and Lorelai who worked for me in and out of a relationship.

	**Rorys reunion with Lorelai was incredibly touching**, as there was a great build-up to their reconciliation. Their hug, exasperated pleas for forgiveness, and a spinning camera made for a memorable and heartfelt moment. Surprisingly enough though, I felt like Rory and Lorelais lack of communication continued beyond their initial separation. Lorelais lack of communication with everyone in her life seemed like a major part of the season that unfolded.

	**On the other hand, Emilys estrangement with Rory was equal parts heart breaking**. It was sad seeing Rory grow resentful of Emily, I always loved the way Rory use to stick up for Emily and Richard and it was sad seeing that admiration falter. However, **it also led to one of my favourite Emily and Lorelai moments, their conversation during Emilys plane purchasing frenzy** was soo humanizing. Emilys admission that she felt like she was getting another shot and her confusion and hurt at losing another child went a long way to uncovering the cold veneer Emily so often wears. It was nice to see Lorelai feel empathy for her mother, going so far as saying that Emily hadnt lost Rory and had never lost her either. That rare moment of the two of them confiding in each other and showing as much affection as is possible between them was one of my favourite moments of their relationship.

	**Im pretty conflicted when it comes to the character of April**. I think she was used as the device to begin the slow and painful divide between Luke and Lorelai. Which is fair, it makes sense that something major like an unknown daughter would have to enter the scene to have Luke begin to neglect Lorelai. However, the character of **April may be a little too quirky for my taste, she feels plucked out of the long established sitcom trope well, the young child with the mouth of a writer**. Then again, it is hard to write child characters without verging into hacky territory, I just remember noticing how fake April seemed when interacting with characters like Jess and Rory. Besides that she is a cute kid and a major catalyst of the seasons events. 

	**Luke not telling Lorelai about April for over two months after they committed to not keeping secrets was pretty boneheaded, and I thought Lorelai handled the revelation with incredible grace and understanding**, although in hindsight maybe she shouldve voiced any qualms she had about it at the time. But I totally understand why she wouldnt and why shed rather opt to give Luke the space he was asking for. But I think that revelation is what kick started Lorelais fears, paranoia and impulsive behavior, I imagine Luke not telling her about it and trying to keep her out of Aprils life led to some deep insecurity. I really think it was a lack of clear communication that deteriorated their relationship over the course of this season.

	**Before I dig further into the Luke and Lorelai stuff Id be remiss not to mention my favourite episode of the season, and quite possibly favourite episode of Gilmore girls period, Friday Nights Alright for Fighting**. The entire episode is great from the whole town spying on Luke and April to the Sorkin-esque thrill of the Yale Daily News achieving the impossible. But the highlight and pretty much my favourite ten minutes of this show so far was the best friday night dinner yet. **The entire dinner was an incredibly inspired piece of television**, not only was it cathartic as a fan of Gilmore girls to see all the Gilmores vent to their hearts content, but as a fan of television in general the whole thing was brilliant. Drama in television has so often existed by the virtue oft the characters on screen never saying exactly how they feel, because conflict cant exist without miscommunication. **The rapid back and forth time jumping mess that was the final act of the episode was a terrifically subversive piece of television**. Its so rare to see characters air grievances so liberally, and it was genuinely some of the most fun Ive had watching tv. I also think it was one of the healthiest Friday night dinners weve ever seen the Gilmores have in terms of their communication with one another. Apart from sweaty brows and high levels of adrenaline,** I imagine all the Gilmores left that dinner having reached a greater understanding of one another**, because venting, yelling and arguing can only lead to healing.


	**Getting back to Luke and Lorelai, the first major inclination I got that the relationship was doomed was during their Valentines trip with Rory and Logan**. It was one of the first times that their chemistry was completely off, **Luke was being a big sourpuss and Lorelai seemed incredibly unhappy, it was a pretty painful episode to sit through**. It really showcased Lukes downsides as a boyfriend, hes curmudgeonly and has a hard time reading signals and making grand gestures, I understand it, guys like Luke arent naturally inclined to be terrific boyfriends, he obviously cares a lot, he just sucks at showing it. Logan was able to bail him out with a Valentines gift, and it was kinda sad seeing how happy the necklace made Lorelai, because she probably wasnt expecting anything at all, and probably wouldnt have voiced any disappointment at not getting one, **I think Lukes last minute gift was just a tiny bandage on a much bigger and festering wound**.

	**Of course the steady decline of the relationship was not all Lukes fault, once he did his part in unknowingly neglecting Lorelai, Lorelai allowed her fears and insecurity to exacerbate the issue**, she never really let her frustrations be known, she allowed all her feelings to bottle up inside until they eventually exploded. I think its become clear to me that Lorelai is a much more complex character than I once assumed, I think she has some deep-seated fears of commitment and trust, her fear that the wedding would never happen became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The last stretch of episodes became so painful and frustrating to sit through, I was panicking watching two people who imo are perfect for each other continue to make dumb decisions and drive each other apart. 

	**Thats not a knock on the show btw, while I wasnt a fan of all the methods used to deteriorate the relationship**, I understand the writers had clearly set the wheels of it in motion from the beginning of the season. **Imo the S6 finale was simply the midway point of a two season arc made to divide and then gloriously unite Luke and Lorelai once again**, I think the problems that transpired were inevitable between the two, because they are two very different individuals, I only hope their time apart will help them realize they were dumb to ever not trust each other. A scenario may exist where Lorelai is single by the end of the show, and Id be ok with that, but Im certain her relationship with Luke will have to be reconciled, and Im low-key hoping theyre back together.

	**There was a brief moment there where it seemed like the relationship would be saved when Luke asked for Lorelais help in livening up Aprils bday party, it was nice seeing the two function like a proper couple again**, but for whatever reason, Aprils mothers objection to Lorelais presence set everything back, I think her talk with Lorelai about not knowing whether Lorelai would be a constant presence in Lukes life finally forced Lorelai to confront the question herself. I think, given her immense vulnerability at the time, **Lorelai convinced herself that Luke didnt actually want to take the leap with her, so she avoided him for as long as she could**.

	**Lorelais mindset is all but confirmed when she breaks down after Emily reveals her and Richard were buying a house for Luke and Lorelai**, on a sidenote I thought it was really sweet that Emily and Richard were willing to do that, it shows that theyd rather see Lorelai happy than get their way in every aspect of her life.  

	**Luke coming in and saving his sisters marriage was a sad bit of irony, he managed to give TJ the perfect piece of advice yet couldnt practice it himself**. I dont know how the fan base mustve felt about Lukes behavior this season but I just found it sad and frustrating, I think he cares about Lorelai more than anything, but his life had gotten soo hectic this season he couldnt manage becoming a new father and staying a good boyfriend at the same time. It wasnt a surprise given that this is the same guy who needed a self help book to realize he was in love with the woman who he had been pining for since the day he met her. Its the sad reality of his character, and **I think this critical issue of Luke and Lorelais expectations in a relationship with one another was going to have to be addressed.**

	**All these hurt feelings and obliviousness comes to a head in the climactic ultimatum scene. I had such a hard time watching it all happen**, Lorelai seemed so flustered and panicked, and like I mentioned I think she had already convinced herself that Luke didnt want to marry her, and Luke just seemed absolutely clueless to what Lorelai had been going through, the ultimatum seemed to hit him out of nowhere. **I dont think he knew the relationship was over the moment Lorelai walked away, and in all honesty I didnt think it was either. As Lorelai walked away I think she felt like she needed to end the relationship for her own good, so she went and did the one thing that would destroy the relationship for sure**. I was just as mortified as Lorelai seemed when she woke up in Christophers bed, going beyond impulsive, its the most self-destructive thing weve seen Lorelai do. 

	And on that fucked up note the season ends, also being privy to the news around the show, **I think the saddest news of all is that this was Amy Sherman-Palladinos final episode. Im so sad that I wont get to see Amys version of this story play out**, because I do believe the end game has always been Luke, and even if it wasnt, Im sad Amys vision didnt get to be carried out, especially since the show was left at such a precarious crossroads for so many characters.

	**I honestly needed some time to recuperate after the S6 finale**, I was so sad at Luke and Lorelais falling out, and Im still scared that Lorelais decision will be considered irreconcilable by Luke. I wasnt supposed to be this invested in this show! It has stopped tasting like comfort food, that or Im getting food poisoning. And Im also choked because I know S7 isnt the most well-received season, so Im scared that whatever resolutions that may come wont be very satisfying. You bastards shouldve warned me about this.

	**Some stray thoughtsI should mention Lanes wedding**, while im not the biggest Zach fan, I always preferred Adam Brodys character far better as a love interest, **I enjoyed the growth of Mrs. Kim and Lanes relationship as a result of her marriage**. Im glad to see those two reach an understanding with each other, also it was funny seeing a scared Mrs. Kim when her mother came to visit, Lane has clearly inherited her fear and respect for authority from her mother. **I also continue to enjoy Logan and Rory as a couple for the most part**, Im not exactly in love with them as a pair, but they definitely dont bore me, and Im still fond of Logan as a character. I thought him revealing that he felt stuck in his fathers plan, that he felt like he was being forced through one big door was pretty sad, and I like the moment of him asking Rory to tell him to stay.


There it all is, those are most of my thoughts, i imagine there are a lot of strong opinions when it comes to S6 and all that transpired, i welcome any and all discussion.

My relationship with GG is a bit of a love/hate one regarding its main characters, I should clarify. 

To begin, Rory. Do I like her more than Lorelai? Sometimes, but often I'm torn which one infuriates me more. Usually I lean toward disliking Rory more. I find her to be the most insufferable, spoiled brat. For someone raised without a lot of money, her sense of entitlement is ridiculous. 
I think the main contributing factor to this is that all her life, she's had it drilled into her head how special she is, how much above all her peers she is. And while she may be smart, I've never seen anything particularly extraordinary about her as the series goes on and she gets to Yale, where her smarts and supposed talent are more evenly matched. I've never understood how she was made valedictorian at chilton, when there's no way in hell she did better than Paris. Her relative mediocrity when among people on the same level as her (as opposed to when she was in Stars Hollow public school) is initially demonstrated to me when they have that forum with the college admissions people, and everything the brilliant Rory thinks makes her a perfect applicant (writing about Hillary Clinton, putting all the listed activities as her hobbies) is laughed at by Paris and the admissions people as being horribly unoriginal and substandard. 
Also, her habit of running away to her grandparents' when Lorelai deviates from her usual sycophantic fawning over Rory and her specialness, or when things aren't going her way. The first time she does this is when she's a high school student and upset about Lorelai and Max and her breakup wth Dean- I can understand this one a bit more, she's a teenager, and I get why she'd be angry with Lorelai about the whole Max thing. 

The next time she does this, though, is when Mitchum (who may be an buttmunch and whose evaluation may have been motivated by him not wanting Logan to marry an ambitious working woman, but he's still a guy who knows the field in which he works and is at the top of) bluntly tells her he doesn't think she has what it takes to be a great journalist. She goes into a tailspin, steals a yacht, quits Yale, and when her mother doesn't support her dropping out from the Ivy League school that everyone in her life has done nothing but help her get into, she moves in with her grandparents without so much as a word to her mother. 
She's so used to everything coming easily to her and everyone fawning over her, that the second things are bit difficult, she melts down completely. Also, I am staunchly anti-Emily and Richard, especially Emily. I find them both to be repellent, condescending, entitled people who for all their concern about appearances and manners, have no problems treating like shit anyone they feel is inferior to them. Lorelai may have many flaws, but I understand why she feels about her parents as she does, and for her to re-enter a relationship with them so they would pay for Rory's schooling, and then for Rory to poopoo all over that and drop out of Yale, made me seethe as the overinvolved audience that I am. This is further compounded by Rory then leaving her grandparents' (again without a word) when they too realize that dropping out of Yale was a poor choice and she realizes that living with them isn't going to allow her the freedom to be a twatwaffle she was hoping it would. Pretty much, whenever she doesn't get her way she fucks off without even the courtesy of saying goodbye. 

Even before the Mitchum comment though, we've already seen evidence that Rory's skills as a journalist aren't quite as prodigious as she'd like to think. When she begins writing for the Yale Daily News, she repeatedly has Doyle rejecting her writing as boring, and we again see her lack of original thought when she chooses the music downloading topic to write about and again finds out from Paris that it's been long overdone. 

Her attitude of being separate and somehow superior to the people her grandparents and Logan associate with is also irritating, because she is an heiress of sorts and a couple years away from being a trust fund deadbeat herself. She's a graduate of Chilton and went to Yale on the dime of her grandparents and her father, she's never worked a proper job (halfassedly swiping cards in the dining hall and using doing inventory at the bookstore as an opportunity to shop don't count as jobs imo) in her life, and was more than happy to live the good life in Logan's apartment or her grandparents' pool house. 

Lastly, her complete lack of remorse or sense of wrongdoing in sleeping with Dean while he was married to Lindsay. Despite her no longer being with him, she felt entitled to him over Lindsay- ""I was with him first!"", and had no qualms at all about him cheating on his wife with her, because she wants him, so that's that.

- Lack of initiative : Spent her summer traveling around Europe and came back so surprised that other people found something worthwhile to do to advance their career. No mention of joining the high school paper until Paris mentioned it to her. 
- Stickler for rules : Takes her car to the dealer because the book said so. I don't think this type of attitude will work well in journalism.
- Does she even write? : For a show that tried so hard to MENTION that Rory is so great at being a future journalist they sure failed to actually SHOW it. I don't think this is just a writing style when they definitely showed Lorelai doing so well managing her inn.
- Too sensitive : Every body around her told her she's so special and so perfect and so beautiful. In theory that's nice but Rory ended up in a delusional bubble of greatness. Mitchum came along and she can't handle it. You know, for the first time someone told her she's not all that, she stole a boat. I mean, that's still so Rory. A boat?!

Rory is a great student. She excels in that. I just don't think she has what it takes in journalism.",67,28,False,self,,,,,

It almost seems like all the kids in public school are either dumb or so average that are not even noticed, and obviously not too invested in school. 

Rory goes there but changes to Chilton as soon as possible, so she doesn't really count. They often hint at Rory being too good for that school and I always get this vibe of kids there being considered idiots. Even in the pilot, we see that Rory is the only one doing the assignment during school and the girls around her find it absurd. 

The other people we see going to public school are Lane and Dean, who do not have high expectations about school, not really interested in college, nor seem to be brighter than usual, and Jess, who is smart but doesn't care about education. It's like if you don't go to private schools then you're not that smart.

I think it is a rather poor representation of society and a rather pretentious one. It's like saying those who have money (hence can afford private schools) are better than those who go to public schools, while the only obvious difference is money. 

While several ""accidental"" discrimintaory things happen in the series, I think this one is pretty strong and goes on for the entire show.

EDIT: I completely forgot about April and her schoolmates. I think it is safe to assume she goes to public school and is surrounded by bright, invested kids. I think I only considered Rory's environment, so that didn't really stick with me (April also happens in season 6, which is the season I dislike the most).",59,37,False,self,,,,,

232,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2016-8-23,2016,8,23,12,4z4m5p,self.GilmoreGirls,A Guide on How to Avoid Spoilers Without Giving Up The Internet,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/4z4m5p/a_guide_on_how_to_avoid_spoilers_without_giving/,gk21,1471924644,"I saw a few people talking about how they can't watch the revival right away or how they prefer to spread things out, but they were worried about spoilers. Well, I tested different ways to avoid spoilers, and Im putting them all in this one post because thats how I like to organize things. How to avoid spoilers on Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and the greater internet below. 

**Tumblr**

There are a few extensions that make it easy to avoid spoilerseven if youre a mobile user!

*[New XKit](https://new-xkit-extension.tumblr.com/); Available for Chrome, Firefox and Safari*

* Using the new XKit, download the blacklist extension and add whatever words youd like to hide from your dash. Be it Gilmore Girls Rory Jess Logan or Luke, you can decide youd most like to hide until youre done watching.
* Blacklist can hide things from your inbox as well, so thats good.
Unless you decide to block blacklisted posts completely (which they dont recommend for some reason) youll still see the tags of a postand people can be chatty in their tags (I know I am) so you might still get spoiled that way

*[Tumblr Savior](http://bjornstar.com/tumblr-savior); Available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera*

* You can block things on Tumblr Savior the same way you use blacklist
* Settings allow you to chose if you see a notification when a post is blocked, show which words have been hidden, wether or not to filter your inbox, and to ignore a posts header or tags when blacklisting if you wish

*[Washboard](http://washboard.ws/); Available for any mobile browser*

* Washboard easily imports your blacklists from Tumblr Savior and allows you to browse tumblr on mobile (through your mobile browser rather than the tumblr app) spoiler free! If youre a mobile tumblr user, Washboard is a must

What these apps wont do: Stop you from seeing spoilers that are labeled incorrectly (think typos), or posts that have your blacklisted terms as part of a graphic or image. They also wont block anything if youre browsing on someones blogthese extensions only work on your dashboard and in the tags.

**Twitter**

If you want to avoid spoilers on Twitter, you might have to give up using the native Twitter app and interface for a bit.

*[Open Tweet Filter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-tweet-filter/bdmjagdcpkfpebaaffpafncgkleijako); Available for Chrome*

* If youre using Twitter in your browser, this is the way to go. It adds an extra Filter button to the top menu bar, then lets you block any keyword, hashtag or user you want.

*[Twitter Clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Twitter_services_and_applications); Available for Desktop or Mobile*

* I wont waste your time giving you a full list, but Tweetdeck and Tweetbot are the most popular and like pretty much every other client, include filtering options in their settings.

**Facebook**

No worries on avoiding spoilers from your status update-happy friendsthis one is pretty easy.

*[Social Fixer](http://socialfixer.com/); Available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Greasemonkey*

* Social Fixer allows you to create a list of keywords to hide just like blacklists.
* It also allows you to hide parts of the Facebook page you dont want to seemeaning you can hide the Trending section as well and protect yourself from any spoilers that may pop up there
* Social Fixer has a lot of other features (such as sorting posts into categories and adding tabs and setting your feed to Most Recent) but all of these things can be turned off in settings if you wish

**Reddit**

Unsubscribe from the GG subreddit and you should be good because posts won't appear on your front page, but if you want to be safe

*[Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/); Available for Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera*

* RES allows you to filter out any keywords in its setting panel
You can choose for filters to apply to all of reddit or only specific subreddits or all but a few subreddits if you wish

**Comment Sections**

People can be the worst. If youre worried about comment sections, dont be.

*[AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/); Available for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Yandex, Maxthon, Microsoft Edge, Andriod and as a mobile browser*

* [AdBlock Plus allows you to customize your YouTube experience](https://youtube.adblockplus.me/), including hiding the comment section

*[No YouTube Comments](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-youtube-comments/hbeblcelbmadebneggicbpkjhlppjoen); Available for Chrome*

* Exactly what you think it is! Blocks out all the YouTube comments

*[Comment Snob](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-comment-snob/); Available for Firefox*

* This extension offers the option to block all YouTube comments or filter thembut it doesnt seem to be regularly updated and wether it currently works is hit or miss

*[Shut Up](https://stevenf.com/shutupcss/); Available for Chrome and Safari*

* Shut Up allows you to block comments sections on many popular websitesYouTube, TVLine, Entertainment Weeklyyoull be safe on all of these sites and practically any site with a comment section
You can easily turn it on and offbut it doesnt allow for comment filtering, just hiding of the whole section

**The Whole Internet**

If you use the methods above, its doubtful youll need to do this. But if youre avoiding spoilers on a more long-term basis this may be the way to go.

*[Feed Rinse](http://www.feedrinse.com/); Available for Everything*

* If you use an RSS feed, Feed Rinse is a must! You can set up filters and itll make sure you have a clean feed in the reader of your choice

*[WebFilter Pro](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webfilter-pro-the-best-fi/ejgfoklefkbjadjcgjmnhfbdfjolojnn?hl=en); Available for Chrome*

* WebFilter allows you to set up a blacklist for the whole internet. Its meant to block adult content and profanity, but if you really want to avoid certain types of news/articles, its a sure-fire way to do it. When you try to visit a site with the words in your blacklist, your browser will block you.

*[Simple Profanity Filter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-profanity-filter/ackkocjhcalcpgpfjcoinogdejibgbho); Available for Chrome*

* You can treat the words you dont want to see like profanity. Just type up anything you dont want to see into the extension and those words will appear as asterisks anywhere they appear. This is my favorite profanity filter, but a quick google search can point you in the direction of a filter for nearly any browser you wish to use

**Tips for Your Blacklists**

Its unlikely everything you want to avoid will have #GilmoreGirls in it, so your list might need to go deeper than that. If you only care about things like Rorys endgamemake sure you block words like Jess, Logan and Dean.

Knowing what we know about the revival, words like wedding and funeral might not be a bad idea, either. Basically, think through the things you dont want to know until you see it on screen and block anything associated with it. Just blocking Gilmore Girls isnt likely to get it done on Twitter, for example.

Most (if not all) of these filters also include a whitelist, so you can let through posts that include your blacklisted terms if they also include terms on your whitelistso you can block wedding but not miss posts about your friends wedding planning, for example.

Hopefully you found this helpful, and feel like you can watch the revival at your own pace if binging isnt your thing. Or you can go and get the Black Friday deal if youre so inclined. Or if you have to go to work and work involves the internethopefully youll be safe!",6,21,False,self,,,,,

At the top Id just like to say that, Im aware of the S7 hate that exists, and Im also aware of those who vehemently defend it. Im going to try to be as honest as I can in the following write-up, I tried to approach the season as unbiased as I could, and my opinions have been informed therein. 

Id also like to mention that, no matter what your opinions on the seventh season are, or on any parts of the show are, you can only be passionate about it if you care; and thats the common thread in every I hate/love rant that exists about the Gilmore girls. So with a deep love for this show that I have so recently discovered, heres how I feel:

	**Overall, the season felt unfocussed** in its overarching narrative, some plot lines dragged; while others werent given the time to properly develop. The plot didnt seem to propel and progress at the same rate, storylines felt stagnant.

 **Early on the life seemed to be sucked out of the show, the first few episodes were the most egregious in terms of sounding and feeling off**. A lot of the dialogue sounded like fanfic and many moments felt out of place. One example I can think of is Rory finding the destruction of Lukes diner to be exhilarating, so much so as to inspire her to watch the Fast and Furious franchise. I dont know if it was the lasting pain of Luke and Lorelais break up that made Rorys behavior seem cold to me, but I would imagine she would be a lot more concerned about the destruction of Lukes diner. 

	**Another early moment that felt odd/out of the place for me was Lukes response to Lorelai saying she slept with Christopher**. She drops that bomb on him and he rapidly walks to his car slams the door and speeds off to Chris house, knocks on the door, and then punches Chris when he answers. Ill admit the scene made me laugh, but it struck me as odd because I dont think the bombshell that was Lorelais confession shouldve been followed up by a comical response from Luke, it seemed cheap, and it undermined the gravity of the situation for me at least.  Although, that example might just be the Luke/Lorelai shipper talking in me.

	**I found Lukes plea to elope and get married really sad**, he was soo oblivious to Lorelais estrangement and I imagine shocked by her ultimatum that he had no idea how far gone there relationship was. Also given Lorelais decision to sleep with Chris so soon after the ultimatum and her reaction to Lukes plea the next morning, **Im curious what Lorelai wouldve done had Luke accepted her ultimatum when she gave it**. Evidence suggests she was already mentally checked out of the relationship at that point, and Im curious if a quicker reaction by Luke couldve done anything to salvage that, maybe it wouldve been exactly what she needed to hear, or perhaps it wouldve only prolonged their inevitable split.

	**I for the most part enjoyed Luke and Lorelais tension-filled interactions** on the street and in the supermarket, although Luke seemed a bit out of character in the coldness he showed Lorelai, pretending not to care at all, I didnt think him capable of that, but I thought Lauren Graham conveyed Lorelais deep sadness and tinge of regret very well.

	**One of the biggest reason this season fell a little flat for me was the tedious relationship of Chris and Lorelai**. And in defense of the writers of S7, this was a path that the show seemed headed already. I dont know if Lor and Chris wouldve spent half a season together had Amy still been there, but the relationship definitely needed some exploring. 

	**I felt very similar about Chris and Lorelai this season as I did about Rory and Dean in early S5**, I understood why the relationship was being explored, but I couldnt see it as anything other than a temporary arrangement. I actually find the idea of Christopher as Lorelais great romantic hurdle fascinating, I think /u/alilabeth very succinctly explained what Christopher has always represented to Lorelai [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/4xv3fj/just_finished_season_6_for_the_first_time/d6j5khe) in my last post. So, **I like the idea of Lorelai needing to pursue something with Christopher in order to have some sort of a breakthrough**. But, after her extremely fresh breakup and initial disgust at having slept with Christopher, I found it odd how quickly Lorelai fell into a relationship with him. To be fair though, that kind of behavior is supported by Lorelais long established impulsiveness and habit of seeking distractions in times of distress. 

	**Besides the fact that I understood why the relationship took place and what it was supposed to mean for Lorelais growth, I just found it hard to sit through**, partly as a Luke x Lorelai shipper, but partly just as a fan of engaging television and narrative progression. 

	**Getting married to Christopher was yet another impulsive decision I wasnt fond of,** mostly I hated it because I knew it would end badly for lorelai again and I just loathed the idea off having to see her suffer through another failed marriage (technically this was her first marriage but I see the instances with Max and Luke as pretty much failed marriages). Another glaring issue with the whole thing being Rorys lack of presence, which almost seemed to foreshadow how doomed the marriage was to begin with. And once again, while I understand and can appreciate the thought process behind bringing Lor and Chris together, the whole affair dragged on for too much of the season and really seemed to slow down the over-arching narrative and character progression.

	**Christophers proposal seemed less impulsive from his perspective, Im inclined to believe he had been giving it some thought for a while**, the show did a good job of showing Christopher pining for a life with Lorelai in S6, and while **I think his decision to sleep with a clearly wounded Lorelai in the S6 finale was messed up, but I also think he perhaps felt entitled to a relationship with her**. I recall Chris saying in Wedding Bell Blues something like everyone knows he and Lorelai belong together, I think he probably saw there rekindled relationship as something that was always meant to be. So I think Chris had given marriage a lot of thought by the time he proposed to Lorelai, but Im not sure if he knew just how vulnerable Lor was at that time. I think marrying Christopher was probably the perfect distraction for her, it was the ultimate method of avoiding confronting the mistakes which had been made with Luke, and perhaps she saw it as a way of salvaging everything. 

	Lukes custody battle came a bit out of nowhere, and once again, I think April and her mother were used as plot devices more so than characters, it was an issue in S6 and it was the same here. For how concerned Anna always seemed with stability in Aprils life, it was an odd seeing her try to completely estrange April from her father. On a side note, I dont know if it was her maturation or a dialing back of her quirks but April was far more enjoyable this season. 

	Even though the custody case seemed a little contrived, I actually enjoyed how it propelled Lukes arc and tied in with Lorelais. **The reference letter was a nice touch imo. It was a clever little way of getting Lorelai to confront her feelings about Luke, which she wouldve taken forever to do organically, and it made for a great moment when Luke gets to hear the letter read aloud**. The crux of the letter was about how Luke has always been a father to Rory, and I think that is one of Lukes greatest attributes in Lors eyes, and its also where Christopher has a history of falling short. I thought it was a nice idea to have Lor go through that realization because I think wanting Chris to be the father he never was, was always Lors dream. 

	**I found Chris situation pretty sad as he slowly began to realize the feelings Lor still had for Luke**, it inspired a jealous and childish attitude in him, and I think it revealed how bad he wanted him and Lor to work out and how he had convinced himself it was meant to be. The moment he found Lors character reference for Luke I think he knew their relationship was over. It prompted his absence when Richard was sick, and became another catalyst to help Lor realize Chris still has a way to go before she can rely on him.

	**On that topic I enjoyed the episode Id Rather Be in Philadelphia**, it definitely felt like a bit of a rehashing of the S1 episode where Richard gets sick, but I think where that episode chose to confront Lors relationship with her parents, this one focused more on Lors feelings towards Luke and Christopher. The episode also had a nostalgic quality to it which I enjoyed, and **I think by this point of the season, the show was starting to get into its groove a little bit and the transgressions in writing werent as apparent**. I also enjoyed Lors slow and begrudging respect for Logan, and of course I enjoyed Luke coming to the aid of the Gilmores.

	The events of that episode pretty much led to the end of Chris and Lorelais marriage, and **while I appreciate the emotional arcs the writers were trying to take Chris and Lorelai on, by the time their relationship ended, the progress the characters made felt unearned**. I think the conversation Chris and Lor have where Lor confesses to really having wanted the relationship to work but admitting her heart wasnt in it, while acted superbly, spelled out a little too explicitly why they were breaking up. My gripe with it was that the scene felt like the writers explaining to the audience why the two werent going to work together rather than two people coming to an understanding with each other. For instance, when it came to Max Medina, Lorelai doesnt ever have a meaningful conversation with Max again til quite a while later, and even then the truths they settle on dont paint the clearest picture, its really only til the S6 finale that we finally actually hear Lor admit she was never in love with him but just desperately wanted to be. So **my gripe with Lor and Chris breakup is how much perspective they seemed to have on it after how messy and rushed the whole relationship had been to that point, it felt like a sloppy attempt at trying to move the characters along their respective story arcs**.

	On a more positive note concerning Chris and Lorelai, **I enjoyed Christophers many interactions with the town of Stars Hollow, I liked the idea of him needing to woo the citizens of Stars Hollow**, and I like how his failure to fit into the whimsical town reflected his failure to fit into the Gilmores life, the same goes for his exploits with the Yale Daily news, though I much preferred his interactions with people like Patty and Babette. In that regard **I felt like Stars Hollow almost served as a surrogate for the audience in their reaction to Christopher, they were willing to give him a shot because they loved Lorelai, but secretly they were all rooting for Luke and Lor to work it out**. I also enjoyed Sookies apprehensive support of Lorelai this season, shes not exactly a perfect friend, but I couldnt help but relate to her regret of Luke and Lorelais falling out.

	**On the topic of Rory and Logan, I actually really enjoyed the maturation of their relationship this year**. I did not at all care for Lucy and Olivia, or the whole Marty plot, nor did I care for Logans british colleagues, come to think of it, Ive never really liked any of Logans friends, I always found Colin and Finn obnoxious and lacking the charm of Logan. But anyways, I did enjoy for the most part the interactions we got between Logan and Rory and I enjoyed how they tried working through their rough patches this season. Rorys relationship with Logan in contrast to the ones she had with Dean and Jess really helped display how mature she has become, a lot of that has to do with her simply being older now, but **I enjoy how her relationship with Logan has been a good representation of her maturity and independence.**

	As I mentioned earlier **I also enjoyed Lorelais begrudging respect for Logan** and found their conversation about Rorys future to be quite engaging, **it was cool to see Logan push for Rory to be more ambitious and take risks, while Lorelai wanted her daughter to be more pragmatic**. It helped highlight the type of presence Logan has always been in Rorys life, while also putting Lorelai in a light quite similar to Emily, **while Lorelai is definitely a ""cooler"" mom, shes very similar to Emily in wanting very badly certain things for her daughters future, shes just a little less nefarious in seeing her wishes become reality**. I suppose wanting things for your children while allowing them to be independent is a universal struggle for parents. 

	**In terms of Logans proposal I found it to come a little out of the blue and I found it interesting how he pretty much gave Rory an ultimatum**, I wasnt pumped that Rory had to choose between a career or a love life as I always saw her being able to have the type of life her mother or grandmother couldnt, but **the events of the finale seem to suggest, Rorys life may mimic her mothers more closely than I wouldve suspected**. In all fairness I think thats an interesting decision in its own right, but I always hoped for Rory to have it all, although that doesnt make great television. And if the Rory and Logan relationship had to come to an end, I dont think thats the worst way it couldve gone. 

	**Another aspect of this season I enjoyed was the development of Lukes relationship with Lane and Zach**, I always enjoyed his interactions with Lane ever since she started working at the diner, but this season I particularly liked how we got to see a lot more of that relationship. Also, **Ive never really been a big Zach fan but I think this season did a good job of making him more likeable** and I thought he had good chemistry with Luke; their interactions were always a bright spot for me. I also liked that they asked Luke to be the godfather to their children. I also enjoyed what the season did with having Zach make some strides into becoming a more believable husband.

	Also, on the topic of Lane, I should mention **my favourite episode of this season was definitely Will You Be My Lorelai Gilmore?** I absolutely loved the storyline of Lorelai being a mediator between Mrs.Kim and Lane, **I find it fascinating how similar the relationship of the Kims is to Lor and Emily, and its cool to see how deftly Lorelai is able to mediate the two of them yet still struggles with Emily, its reminiscent of Luke being able to solve the problems of others yet struggling with his own**. This episode had a certain early Gilmore girls vibe, the stakes were relatively low, and the character interactions were really enjoyable. The baby shower itself was fun, and Lanes titular request to Rory was really sweet. 

	**The road to Luke and Lorelais reconciliation was mostly enjoyable for me, but its the reconciliation itself that felt unearned and a bit anticlimactic**. In terms of what I liked, I liked most of Luke and Lorelais friendly banter, and I liked how they were both allowing themselves to be thrust into situations with each other, it reminded me of Emily and Richards behavior when they were on there way to recoupling. **I thought the reference letter, and Richards heart attack did a good job of getting Luke and Lorelai to a place where they could realize their feelings about one another and try to be cordial again**. And I think the shipper in me mostly enjoyed all their interactions in the later parts of the season, I also thought the writing got a lot better by that point, and the banter between them was reminiscent of their early season interactions. **On the whole, I think parts of S7 did a pretty good job of harkening back to the early seasons of Gilmore girls.**

	Also, **is it just me or was Lorelais car dilemma some sort of metaphor for the seventh season itself?** Luke tells Lorelai that shes going to need a new car, but she doesnt want anything but the exact same car shes always had, Luke tells her thats ridiculous but then goes ahead and gets a new engine installed trying his best to keep the car exactly as it had been before. **I see the car being a metaphor for the seventh season, Lorelai being the fans of Gilmore girls, and Luke being the writers of the seventh season.** Idk, I think theres something there.

	**I really wasnt a fan of the heart to heart Luke and Lor had during the hay bale maze episode**. The whole scene played much like Lor and Chris breakup in that **the characters seemed to once again just say exactly what the writers wanted the audience to hear**. I understand Luke an Lor had spent a lot of time thinking about their relationship at that point and what had went wrong, but **having them both just cop to the mistakes they made and apologize felt extremely underwhelming, the joy from that moment didnt adequately counter the devastation of their break up**, also I cant imagine them having such great perspective on the situation or even being void of any underlying emotions at that point. **It felt like an all too easy resolution.**

	**As for Lorelais karaoke confession, I found the whole scene to be great in theory but pretty lame in execution**. I ultimately found it to be a little silly and sappy, a part of me likes the spectacle of it, but I mostly found it uncomfortable. **I do however marvel at Lauren Grahams acting ability at making the scene work**, she did a great job with it and gave the moment some heart. She had to simultaneously play drunk and a little embarrassed, and then she had to convincingly be anxious of Lukes arrival and then transition into forgetting where she is and perform a remorseful love balad to him, all the while confined to the lyrics of Ill Always Love You. **She killed that scene and perhaps I just found it lame because I felt the secondhand embarrassment of the moment.**

	**As for the finale, I thought it was a pretty good send off for the show albeit a little underwhelming**, like most of the season before it had been. It was nice to see the entirety of Stars Hollow working together, and **I loved Lukes gesture for Rory and more so for Lorelai**. Richard being emotional and proud of Lorelai was a very sweet moment, and **Lorelai agreeing to continue Friday Night Dinners without any obligation was very sweet and a nice bookend moment**, considering she got bribed into FNDs right in the pilot.

	Like I mentioned before I like the idea of Rory pursuing a career, and I also like the idea of the two main Gilmore girls being pretty much single at the end of the show.**The Luke and Lorelai kiss was a nice moment** and felt somewhat earned compared to amny other moments this season. **The final scene in Lukes diner was a nice touch; I enjoyed how it referenced the pilot and thought it was an appropriate place to end the show**. With all that said, **the finale felt a bit like the writers going through the motions, especially after so many of the big moments of S7 fell flat for me.** So any satisfaction I may have had at where the show ended up was a bit hollow, because soo many of the character beats leading up to it felt inorganic.

My overall impression of the show in its entirety is of course extremely positive. The show has a small-town charm to it, its nostalgic and comfortable yet manages to be subversive in all the right ways. The snappy and intelligent dialogue reminds me of one of my all-time favourite shows, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, yet Gilmore girls is able to maintain its own strong identity. I think Gilmore girls greatest lasting strength is its rarity, it resembles many shows, but is ultimately unlike anything Ive seen on tv before, it has a very unique appeal and I know Ill be drawn to rewatch it some time down the road.

And it goes without saying that I am extremely excited about the revival, four 90 minute episodes is a huge amount of new content when you think about it and Im soo glad Amy is rightfully back at the helm to carry out her vision.

Lastly Id just like to give a big thanks to this subreddit and all of the regular commenters on my posts. This subreddit was instrumental in supporting my Gilmore Girls addiction, and the experience of being able to share my thoughts and have a back and forth with long-time fans was awesome. **Thanks for reading, and please comment and discuss.**

P.S.: I apologize for the ridiculous length of this post, I had a lot to say and couldnt help myself.

They had a lot of depth and were relate-able. No one character was written to be perfect or completely evil. 

So, this made me wonder- How will Rory and Lane's friendship be in the revival? 

Rory seemed to appreciate the upper-class lifestyle more and more as the show went on. She was an Ivy League graduate, went on Obama's campaign trail and had a highly connected family. She also had at least one trust fund, probably two. When the show ended, she was single and child-free.

Lane got more involved with the band, and seemed to patch up some rough areas with her mom. She got married and got pregnant quickly and unexpectedly. She doesn't have the same safety nets that Rory has, but has a good support system. Even if Zach does well touring, money will most likely be something Lane has to worry about. 

Besides Stars Hollow and having a supportive family, it seems like Lane and Rory have little in common.

I was thinking that Lane would probably grow closer to Sookie and Lorelai (if anyone), because they have more of an understanding of what she's dealing with.

We recently just saw a post where u/turtleflirtle asked about ""The mess Amy left behind"" but more often it's labeled as outright sabotage.  I'm putting it out there that this isn't my favorite season, and I do think there are problems, however, I don't think Luke and Lorelai are as out of character as people want to believe and I generally think that the arc makes sense as well as pushing the characters into new dynamics that keep the show from becoming stale.  The most obvious indication of this is that numerous people who declare this season the worst season still list Friday Night's Alright For Fighting as their favorite episode.  But on a broader level, the problems between Luke and Lorelai are present from the first episode, or even the season five finale really, but I'll start with this exchange:

LUKE: Are you sure you wan to celebrate now? I mean a minute ago when you came in here...

LORELAI: I just want to be happy right now. Okay?

LUKE: Okay.

Now u/shawnsan32 recently expressed doubt as to whether Lorelai really loved Luke or if her proposal was more about filling the void of Rory's absence.  Now, I wouldn't go that far, but I feel the fact that everyone took so much exception to that perspective is off too.  I think she did love him, but, whether she did or not, that's an incredibly worrisome sentence. It's like she asked him to marry her because she wanted to be distracted, to run away from the pain, and if we're honest, Lorelai does this constantly. Hell, when she argued with her parents about Rory applying to Yale, she literally showed she'd rather be out in the cold than deal with it. She told Rory to give Max his book back. She wanted to break up with him because she was scared of actually loving him. When she realized she didn't, she took off on a trip to escape it. There are numerous examples including the most famous of all, when she ran away from home as a pregnant teenager.

While it's not my favorite season, I like to defend season 6 for a couple of reasons. I think people get caught up in what they want to happen and forget who these people are.

Lorelai constantly wants things exactly to her specification and NOW. In that way she's a lot like her mother, even if the 'what' is quite different. Even within season 6, we see a woman who says she doesn't want to get married until she and Rory have made up, and Luke is fine with that. Luke, on the other hand, finds out he has a daughter and wants to figure that part of his life out and Lorelai can't take it and issues a 'I want this now' and runs off and sleeps with Christopher. But this isn't out of character either. Whenever she's unhappy she tends to be self-destructive. Let's recall sleeping with Christopher on the balcony or the first time she calls Digger for a date.

Now, you can argue about whether they should have brought in a daughter for Luke, but within the context of the show it causes really interesting parallels that allow us to understand the characters better. All we have to do is go back to when Max and Lorelai were hot and heavy and we can hear Lorelai tell Max that Rory is done and that he doesn't have a role in her life.

MAX: I'm not joking here. We're getting married Lorelai.

LORELAI: I know.

MAX: Well, that means we're taking two separate lives and melding them together. I mean, how do you think that's gonna work?

LORELAI: I don't know.

The reason she wants to break up with him the first time is because Rory used his first name and it freaked her out. So what we have in Lorelai are huge double standards.

Then we have Luke who is very stubborn and slow to move, but has been patient with all of Lorelai's issues. He's crabby, but he's been crabby before. Throughout the series he usually doesn't like Rory's boyfriends. As soon as he hears about Dean he tells Lorelai he's trouble. Then of course there's the Bop it. So after the boat stealing and everything else he's heard, I find it reasonable that he'd revert to curmudgeon when thrown in a room with Logan, or a basketball court as the case may be, especially with the added pressure of becoming a father. (Actually, my biggest problem with that infamous Valentine's episode is that Rory cooks and goes to the gym, but I digress.) Anyway, so Luke is focusing on April, and he's trying to figure that out and here's the thing about Luke: He's really good at focusing on one thing basically. Usually it's Lorelai, but we saw him go all in with Jess. A daughter is another level though, and as much as I like Lorelai, if she were in Luke's shoes, she'd be putting April first, just like she did with Rory. Rory was sixteen and no man had ever stepped inside their house. It's an incredibly poignant moment when Luke expresses his fear that April won't like him anymore as soon as she meets Lorelai. In a way that's him telling Lorelai just how much he admires her.

I'd even argue that Lorelai knows an ultimatum won't work with Luke. We remember when she told him to go camping. We remember how she just had to meddle in his dark day. He got over both, but it took time.

The fact is, Lorelai sat around feeling sorry for herself and how she wasn't going to get married when she'd been the first to put the marriage on indefinite hiatus. But everything has to be on her schedule versus Luke's I need time to digest this. This is exactly what caused their first breakup. Luke walked out of Richard and Emily's wedding and said he needed time, but Lorelai wouldn't give it to him. She had to feel good now. It had to be on her terms. Meanwhile, how often was Luke patient with her? Between pining for her and keeping the fortune, dealing her parents, going to the vowel renewal he specifically objected to, being okay with the fact that Lorelai had seen Christopher to get money for Yale and even saying it was the right thing for Christopher to do. This in itself was character development as he was putting being a father ahead of everything else even in his understanding of Christopher.

This is all to say that the entire foundation of their proposed marriage, from that first moment of 'Luke will you marry me,' to Lorelai waking up in Christopher's bed was built on shaky ground... or turbulent seas, if we're considering Rory's boat theft. We have two people who are independent and selfish, who rant and tend to dislike people seeing the world differently, and that first moment of will you marry me is placed on an instability. I mean, why do you think Luke has reservations? She said she just wanted to be happy and he said okay, and I can help but feel like there was a dry swallow at the back of his throat, because he's getting something he wants, but certainly not getting it the way he wants it. And yet, he's still dealing with it. He's still putting her first. Throw another instability in there though, someone he has to put first, and everything comes crumbling down, whether they love each other or not. Crazier things have happened in life.

Anyway, I'm not asking everyone to agree with me, but I just wanted to play a little devil's advocate and maybe cause some reevaluation of a controversial storyline.",9,52,False,self,,,,,

Jess and Luke: Both equally care for Rory. 
ex: When Rory dropped out Yale, Luke's first reaction was to go into one of his rants where he sets out a plan in his panicked/outraged voice. When Jess heard the news he was visibly angry. He raised his voice at Rory and tried desperately to snap her out of it (and he did).
They were both quiet and less outgoing than the girls but never kept them from being themselves. Both of them were slightly pining after the girls at one point or another. 


Logan and Christopher: Both very flippant when it comes to Rory and Lorelai. Clearly cared deeply about them and were able to keep up with them but they never truly pushed them. The only time Logan really pushed Rory out of her comfort zone in a healthy way was when he got her to jump off the ledge during the Life and Death Brigade weekend in Season 5. But even Logan admitted that it was stupid. He loved Rory but it always seemed like he was trying to make her something that she wasn't.

Throughout the show, Lorelai continually goes back to Chris because he was her first love, and they always portray him as the person who knows Lorelai the best, even though he knew her as a child. As Rory dates Dean, Lorelai always pushes Rory back to Dean because he is her first great love. She tells Jess that they are madly in love, she gives Dean lots of advice, she tells Rory to stay in the relationship even when it is bad. Even when it is obvious that Dean is possessive, abusive, a cheater, and always ready to beat Rory because she intimidates her, she thinks he is a great guy, and pushes him on her impressionable daughter. Lorelai is more committed to her daughter's HS boyfriend than any mother should be, and I am wondering if the overly romanticized first love is a theme of the show, or a fault of one character. Also as a side note, it always seems like she has a strange thing for Dean and her conversations with him seem more equal than those he has with Rory, so it makes for strange power dynamics.

I'm sure this has come up many times within subreddits - but I've been watching bits and pieces of GG and Parenthood lately and can't help but marvel at what an incredible actress she is. I thought it would be fun to gather everyone's favorite LG acting moments by season. I'll start with mine! They tend to center around dramatic moments, but I'd love to hear about times when you think she nailed comedic scenes too. Maybe someone can put them in a supercut and send it to the Academy of Television! Lol.


* Season 1 - Lorelai's fight with Emily after Rory's dance when Rory falls asleep with Dean. So so good - from her panic to her anger, it's all brilliant. ALSO When Lorelai and Emily argue over Emily's reaction to Lorelai's engagement announcement.


* Season 2 - Lorelai's face when Chris tells her Sherry is pregnant. It's perfect. And her ""congratulations"" to him with the heartbroken smile - just awesome. 

* Season 3 - Lorelai's fight with Chris when he crashes Friday night dinner. Her proud cry at Rory's graduation.


* Season 4 - THE WALTZ. So good. The confusion/shyness/curiosity of the budding romance with Luke. Also Lorelai's reaction to Rory sleeping with Dean was excellent.


* Season 5 - Basically every scene in ""Say Something."" She does the heartbroken cry SO WELL. 


* Season 6 - All of the Rory rift scenes. Incredible face acting - you can tell it's ripping her apart not to be talking to Rory. 


* Season 7 - ""You are the man I want to want"" Say what you will about this Christopher marriage storyline - but the woman does the heartbroken cry SO WELL. My gosh, I had like a visceral reaction to that moment.


* Parenthood - there's an episode centered around Seth, her charcter's alcoholic ex-husband, that is chock full of incredible LG moments. I mean like really good.
