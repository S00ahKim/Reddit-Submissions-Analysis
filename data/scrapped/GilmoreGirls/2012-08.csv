During that year, the CW was calling its new episodes ""fresh"" and *Summerland* was one of the new shows it was airing. I still squirm when I hear him say it! It is just such an obvious plug for another show, something that I feel Gilmore Girls was pretty good about NOT doing (so obviously at least).

Anyone else ever notice that? Does it bug anyone else?",5,7,False,self,,,,,
