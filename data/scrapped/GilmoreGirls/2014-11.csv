I totally agree with her decision to stop going to school. I think it's probably the smartest decision to make especially since she's sure that journalism is currently not the path she should be going in. 

Her final two years at Yale are for finishing her undergraduate degree which means she has to take classes that are within her major. No more general ed. Meandering through classes that may or may not pique her interests may not be helpful. 

She eventually has to go back to Yale anyway since her class credits may or may not transfer to another college. 

Lorelai was being ridiculous. What makes her think that Rory would just stop going to school for no good reason? Everything she worked for until that point has suddenly become for nothing. It's important to take time to readjust and think about how to move along. If Lorelai had not blown everything out of proportion, she could have enjoyed having Rory home for a little longer while still being involved in her life.

* Alexis Bledel's voice/delivery is so precious and baby-voice I can't stand it, so that is a big part of it.
* Rory basically cheats on Dean with Jess, then cheats with Dean while he's married and doesn't really care, then later gets crazy upset when Logan fools around with other girls while they're broken up/on a break. Uhh, hypocrite much?
* So a newspaper magnate tells her she's not cut out to be a journalist. Obviously that would be pretty upsetting for anyone, but doesn't justify acting like a complete brat to everyone in her life. She is such a weak person, especially compared to Lorelai.
* Speaking of which, the stuff she writes isn't that great...which is odd since the show's writers are obviously talented.
* She generally just seems pretty spoiled, which is weird considering she spent her early years growing up in a potting shed with a teen mom working as a maid.

I had a different impression.

1. I wish Rory dated Jess while she was in college. I felt like the show wasn't being consistent. The only reason why Rory came back to college was because of Jess who ultimately said that he knows her and this just wasn't her. It just doesn't make sense that he was the reason she got her life together, and yet she didn't try to contact him afterwards.

2. There were so many random and silly stories like when Jackson found marijuana on his property and he and Sookie were trying to get rid of it. That has got to be the most stupidest plot I've ever seen on tv. 

3. I hated when April randomly found Luke. The show jumped a shark. It was just such a random thing to happen. Honestly I forwarded all of the scenes of her and Luke. A much better story line would have been how Jess changed from being an immature kid who caused trouble, to someone who published his own book. I really feel like that story line was missed. And yeah, I know he was doing another show but they could have made it work. 


4. Sores and Boils Alley was another stupid story line. 


5. I didn't hate Logan as much as I thought I would. I think he acted immature (like when he told Lucy that Rory knew Marty) but overall I thought he was a good boyfriend. It was a good adult relationship. 


6. I feel like the show ended in a weird way. It felt like it ended in the middle of a sentence.

7. Personally I didn't really see a change in the characters during the last season. I just felt like the story lines and plots were not thought out and kinda stupid.

I also thought Rory acted extremely out of character both by sleeping with Dean, and by the way she acted afterwards. First, she refused to accept that what they did was wrong or even that she helped Dean cheat on Lindsey, and then she was mad at Lorelai for *weeks* because Lorelai pointed those things out to her and tried to talk some sense into her.

I just thought that they both acted really out of character during the end of S4 and into the beginning of S5. What do you guys think?
