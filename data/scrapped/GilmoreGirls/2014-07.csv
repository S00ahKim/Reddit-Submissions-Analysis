Is it because nothing on the show feels ""real""? Is it because nobody talks like that? (keeping in mind I can watch Dawson's Creek reruns anytime)

I have yet to see the finale, but I can only hope that it ends with everyone being trapped in Luke's Diner during a grease fire.  

I'm not trying to be rude, I'm a grown man who quietly enjoys Degrassi, Felicity and whatnot...but god damn do I not care if Rory makes it home for Thanksgiving dinner.",4,0,False,default,,,,,
