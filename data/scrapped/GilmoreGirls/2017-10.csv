Spoiler about Season 5 and the revival episodes**





I'm only on season 5 but watched the revival first so I know where it's heading. So, first off, I love Lane's side plot in the series but the only thing that bugs me is that she ends up marrying Zach. I can't even understand how they even go together. I thought David was a much better ""type"" because he was smart and also into the band stuff.

I felt so sad after watching the revival because it made it seem like Lane just settled and Zach seems to be worse than he ever was in his old age. At least he has small town grocery store manager going for him finally at 40. I think it reminds me of people I know who have bright futures and get pregnant and settle for people with no ambition. I guess I feel sad for Lane that her dreams to become a famous drummer died and she ended up with loser Zach. It feels like a great portrayal of real life though, as much as I wished her story turned out like Rory's path or at least somewhat more successful than where she is in the revival. Buuut I'm also glad that they showed a very realistic portrayal of what a lot of people like Lane go through at that age and how their lives just end up being normal or mundane in the end.

* **The Nanny and The Professor**: Lorelai is surprised when she and Rory go to Luke's and Lane's working there. Rory says Lane's started there ""a couple of days ago"". We know Lorelai goes to Luke's daily and in multiple times, wouldn't she see Lane there before? And if for some reason Lorelai doesn't go to Luke's for days, wouldn't she still get the news about Lane from Rory before actually going to the diner? Like in a call, Rory can casually talk about it, or even call Lorelai to tell her specifically the news (I mean, these girls talk about anything).

* **Driving Miss Gilmore/Partings**: The events of Driving Miss Gilmore (great ep, btw) happen on a thursday and Partings the very next day. We know that because Lorelai spends the night at Sookie's and then the next day she gets a call from Rory about where she was, and they talk about friday night dinner being that night. In Driving Miss Gilmore, Emily was practically blind and Richard was in North Dakota, unable to come back to Hartford in time. In Partings, Emily's vision is fine and Richard's there like nothing happened. The blind thing is even mentioned as the settlement they're going to receive from the Dr performing the surgery is going to be used to build Rory's building. So we just need to assume that in the course of one night, Emily's vision is back to normal with no need to mention it again, Richard is back from his trip and there not only has been a lawsuit agains the Dr but a settlement as well. That's just amazing timing.

* **Written in the Stars**: Lorelai and Luke's relationship is a point of contention in the town meeting. Taylor mentions Fay Wellington and Art Brush as examples of how detrimental a relationship between steemed business owners in the town can be. Lorelai and Luke have no idea about that story. Now, Lorelai has been in Stars Hollow since Rory was born, so at least 19 years by then. Babette mentions how the relationship between Fay and Art was ""about 10 years ago"", so Lorelai should have known all about it. Specially if it was so significant in the town, I imagine it was all the talk back then. Luke can be excused from knowing because he's the kind of guy that doesn't get involved in things like that, gossip and all.

EDIT: I've just started to watch again Driving Miss Gilmore and there's another detail to add: In the cold opening, the girls are fighting in friday night dinner. Emily mentions how her surgery is ""tomorrow"" ie saturday. Yet when Emily goes blind is clearly a thursday, or at least it should be according to the timeline of what I wrote up there. I don't think simptoms about the surgery would wait 5 days to appear. It doesn't make sense.",57,29,False,self,,,,,

Heres mine:
For the first 4 seasons, I thought his constant care and attention towards Lorelai and Rory was sweet, but getting to the point of sad. He was sabotaging his relationships just at the IDEA of being with Lorelai, which is so damaging to his psyche. 

Once L+L start dating, however, I think its really amazing just because he can keep up with her wackiness, and they have an incredible back and forth dialogue. However, like several people have said, their communication skills are for naught. They keep things from each other constantly, which is one of the ONLY things I liked about Lorelai and Christophers relationship; the fact that they could be so open with each other is SO important in a relationship. 
And if Luke had just straight-up talked to Lorelai about April instead of hiding it for a month, she might have been more okay with him taking longer to process it, just because she would be in on it as well. 

In AYITL, I was super disappointed at the fact that they werent married yet. I completely agreed with Emily on the fact that they could have just been considered roommates with benefits. Why did they wait SO LONG to get married, it doesnt make sense? If by the time they had reconciled, Lorelai had already decided she was ready to be married and to be a wife to someone she loves, why wait???

-The reason he was Mick in early episodes and Kirk the rest of the seasons was simply because Amy forgot that she named him that.

-There was never, EVER any ad libbing, as Kirk.  However, plenty of the dances and movements were Sean's creation.  He mentioned the Evolution of Man performance, in particular, and Dan literally had no instructions in the script, only: ""Kirk does an elaborate mime of the evolution of man.""

I gd hate this episode. Not the plot in general, just its so poorly written/acted/edited. Let the rant begin! 

FIRST OFF - the ridiculous plot device of the bookshelf that doesnt fit ANYWHERE in the inn so dean will happily drop it off to Yale, as if,

Richard and Jason are golfing and floyd comes along (dude who plays floyd is seriously hamming it up as well which really irked me) and Richard just agrees to dinner immediately even though Floyd supposedly cost him his job.

The whole episode is a Diageo advert anyway. I know shows need to do product placement but its SO apparent here. The way Richard holds the gin up, the way there is a framing shot of Lorelai and Jason with a bottle of Ciroc smack bang in the middle of the screen.

And I really hate the actor who played Floyd. That was such an important episode that was so crucial to the arc of season 4 and the reveal is so over the top, almost camp.

However, throughout the show there's some things that stuck out to me/I have questions about and want to see what you think. I'm now watching it again and here are two things that bother me--

1. How in the world was Rory valedictorian and how did she get into Harvard and not paris?
I understand that Rory was extremely smart, yada yada, and I loved her character and was glad she got into Harvard and Yale and all that. However, it made no sense to me that she could have gotten better grades than paris!
-for example throughout the show it's clear that Paris never gets anything less than an A, and her and Rory clearly have many classes together so that's not the issue. In addition, atthe beginning of season 1, Rory finds out she got her first D on a paper or something like that. Even if she raised it up to an A, it couldn't have been as high as paris.
-second of all, even if Rory had slightly better grades than Paris and maybe a slightly higher GPA, paris was the president of the school AND newspaper editor main person!! Whereas Rory was just the VP and another writer. 
-finally, it's clear that paris knew way more about college prep like the episode where Rory was stressed out she never volunteered and all that.
I understand it's just a show and a lot of things factor into getting into college, but I always felt bad for paris for not getting into the school of her dreams!!

2. Logans mom and grandfather are seen as evil for saying Rory isn't ""fit for their family"" and everyone attacks them and stuff.
-why wasn't it as big of a deal when Richard attacked Dean at dinner? He was way more evil (I love Richard but in this episode....) and was more mean to dean, but Lorelei and Rory were upset but not that much. 
I always just found it odd..

So for now, we'll settle for scoop on the character. ""This woman is a trophy wife, slightly older than Lorelai, who comes from Emily and Richard's social world,"" she says. ""She married a much older man who died and left her everything. Now she wants to do something important and be more than just beautiful. So she comes to Emily for advice on opening a major museum in Hartford. Basically, she's saying, 'Can you teach me to be you?'

She was totally mean-girled at Chilton, and not popular.  Sure it gets better, but I think that would be very hard to deal with.
She studies her ass off. Sure she gets good grades, but she always does ton of research, and studies very hard.
We hear multiple times how growing up her and Lorelai had no money and scrimped and saved.
She is shown helping at the inn from the beginning of the show.
Yes she accepts a loan from her grandparents for Yale, but she refuses to just let them for it, which they happily would have done.  
You also have to assume that they just paid tution as she works throughout, at the bookstore, and as the cafeteria card swiper to pay for living expenses.
When Chris comes into money all she wants is the money for school, not a new car, or castle as he offered.
Yes she gets to go to Europe on more than one occasion, but her and Lorelai don't seem to go on many vacations.  
She ends up getting way more community service after stealing the yacht than expected, when realistically as an ivy league student with no priors she easily could have gotten off.  I don't think that would have been using family strings at all.

Rory to have a conscience and to understand how immoral it was to sleep with someone's fiance and to cheat on her own boyfriend and drag him along

Rory to be willing to work to better herself 

Rory to understand that you're supposed to start at the bottom and work your way up to your dream job, that few people are so amazingly good from the start and most have to work for it

Rory to remember Christiane Amanpour's words that no matter the job, you just have to get over there and get writing (but oh wait, I'm sure in AYITL S7 didn't happen so I guess she didn't actually meet her)

Rory to choose to take a more humble job in her field in order to not live off of other people (trust fund, mother, friends, grandmother)

Rory to feel the slightest remorse regarding her treatment of Odette and Paul and understand how her actions are harmful to them too, not just to think she needs to stop sleeping with Logan because it's bad for her (which it was I guess).

In short, it's not Rory's situation or actions or general storyline I had an issue with, it was her attitude and way of dealing with the consequences of it all.

I also want to note that after reflecting on all this, I've reached the conclusion that Rory's shitty life was her fault/choice. She could have had a job and maybe a stable relationship (or be single but have dignity and not be the cheater and the other woman) but she chose time and time again not to and it sort of sucks because OS Rory had her faults but not to this degree and she was young then, she might have changed.",23,55,False,self,,,,,

Like are we even watching the same show..? I mean, i love Milo as much as the rest of us, hes gorgeous and a great actor and i definitely swooned for him in the beginning as Jess but he is in no way too good for Rory. They were complete opposites in the beginning, he was rude, independent, snarky, uninterested in making/having friendships or relationships with his family and stole a lot. All things that go against Rorys character but thats only a little thing.

When they actually started getting to know eachothers sure he made an effort but he also disrespected her relationship with Dean any chance he could get, he was a huge jackass towards him and also Loralai. He helped Rory cheat on Dean which i dont think should earn him this angel status at all. 

Once he finally got Rory he didnt even treat her good, he was completely uninterested in anything she was interested in, mocked multiple things, wouldnt even go to the town events with her which are clearly important to her, he only went to the carnival be a dick to Dean and his sister and make sure they didnt reunite. He lies to Rory about the bruised eye thing and is a complete asshole to her and Emily then just bolts. If my boyfriend did that to me i would be furious. He cares more about making out with her than actually being with her half the time. Then pressures her into makingout/sex at the party and yells at her when shes clearly vulnerable and upset. 

Then he just ditches out on her without even a goodbye or anything. She breaks up with her loving stable boyfriend of 2 years for him and he just totally fucks her over. Then shows up and tells her he loves her and BOLTS AGAIN. Then shows up asking her to runaway with him, uhhh what about her family, her school, her career, her friends ???? He doesnt give a shit as long as he gets his way again. 

In no way are Dean and Logan perfect but Dean was a million times a better guy and boyfriend for Rory; however im glad they didnt end up together. I love her with Logan and think they are a lot better together than Jess or Dean during her 20s. 

In the revival i wish she wasnt still seeing Logan and that after she denied his proposal they would of went their separate ways then in the revival she could of reunited with Jess and rekindled their romance now that theyve both grown and matured as people. I think once they grew up they would of been a great match.

I mean it wasnt unbearable or anything which is nice but when I finished it I found that it didnt have an impact on me at all like the original show did. I was pretty annoyed with the story in this one.

#What I Didnt Like
**1. The Treatment of Paul**
Look I didnt mind Paul the first few times he made his appearance and EVERYONE in this show had to point out how forgettable he was, but once youve tolerated the first episode of it, it gets extremely exhausting. For shits sake Rory, just put a reminder on your phone to break up with him or just do it over text from the way your relationship is heading! I cant believe I had to tolerate four episodes of that dumb storyline. Thank you Paul for just breaking up with Rory.

**2. The Portrayal of Lane**
I just couldnt help but go, Really? I mean, Lane has spent almost her entire time as a teenager trying to hide this world of music that shes so passionate about from her mom. I just cannot see Lane settling down with running the antique shop. She seems to be in the kind of place her mother is in instead of making a place of her own.

Also I dont get how shes Rorys best friend. I feel that Rory and her barely talked and she somehow seemed to be there at the convenience to the plot or to Rory. Lane deserved a more thought out life from the writers and more screen time.

**3. The Lack of Credit Towards Jess**
In _Gilmore Girls_ when Rory drops out of Yale, it was Jess who brought her back on track. I dont know how it worked but Jess gave her a reality check that Rory desperately needed while Logan was just being a drunk ass.

Even in the revival we see Jesss character change and develop! After Rorys spent so long being lost and not sure what to do with her career it was freaking Jess who pushed her towards writing a book!

Seriously, if the guy she was the least involved with has somehow had some of the greatest impacts on Rorys life towards literally life changing decisions, doesnt that mean something?

**4. The Lack of Communication Between Luke and Lorelei**
I find it pretty hard to believe that after about 10 years of being together, they havent been able to make decisions about being married or having children. What? The only explanation I can possibly credit towards this is that as a fan it would be weird to (1) see another kid after watching Rory-Lorelei and April-Luke for so long and (2) just be told that theyre now married and not get to experience it on _Gilmore Girls_. I guess showing them on the show having kids and being married is more natural for us to experience (even if its after 10 years). But I still found it quite odd.

I also didnt think that there had to be so many communication issues. Lorelei and Luke couldve easily talked about things instead of constantly hiding stuff from each other about Loreleis therapy and Lukes franchising options. I only saw this is as a poorly done plot point to lead to Lorelei deciding to do _Wild_ (the book of course, not the movie).

**5. The Stars Hollow Musical**
Do I really need to explain this one?

**6. RORY**
Dear God. Ugh. I had to control myself from writing paragraphs and already making this much longer than it needs to be. Im just going to make a bulleted list:

- Rory clearly hasnt learned anything from seasons 4 and 5 from when she had her affair with Dean, so why the hell is she doing this again with Logan when we all know this cannot end well

- Lorelei really doesnt tell Rory that shes wrong like she did in _Gilmore Girls_ which just causes her to be more worshipped or whatever the hell she is in Stars Hollow

- even though Logans father put her down about her making it as a reporter, when things got slightly harder for Rory she decided to use her connections to just make it ahead instead of working harder?

- Rory really expected some things to be handed down to her because she just shows up to one of the company interviews completely unprepared and expected them to hire her like honey if youre not interested in the company, then the company is not interested in you

- Rory was a terrible girlfriend to Paul just everyone was terrible to Paul and she doesnt even get the slightest shit for it

- I dont know if we were expected to feel sorry for her after the whole Logan thing and her feeling sad

- Rory is pretty much a terrible friend because I dont see her actually caring about Lane, Paris, or even Jess and somehow theyre all there for her convenience

I cant believe that Rory Gilmore was my least favorite character in the entire show but she was. Oh how I miss my Chilton Rory.

**7. This Circle of Life Thing Theyre Trying to Do**
Oh yeah. The infamous last four words of the revival. I have no idea what the hell that was supposed to be. But I do not support this whole thing with Logan = Christopher, Jess = Luke, and Rory = Lorelei. First of all I feel like Lorelei has actually worked for all of the shit that she has whereas Rory is 32. If youre finding yourself then that doesnt equal a comparison to you being like your mother who went through many hardships at a significantly younger age to raise you! Also Logan and Jess are more developed than that and I cant imagine how this show can even think of making Logan a parallel to freaking Christopher. I really hope in season 2 they dont show that and instead something better.

#What I Liked
**1. Emily Gilmore**
I liked a lot of small things. But one thing I liked 100% was Emilys development. I liked how her being independent lead to her accepting that some things have died off with Richard (like her commitment to the DARwhich was pretty funny to watch, btw). Watching her story up to when she moves on towards the decision to sell everything off and try new things and finally find a maid that she likes was so refreshing. Congrats on stealing the spotlight, Emily (sorry, Rory).

**2. Lorelei Telling Emily about Her Best Birthday**
This scene has to be watched, to be honest. My heart is all warm and happy!

**3. The Wedding!**
Although pretty late, watching Luke and Lorelei tying the knot was one of the best things of the show and one of the best things to put in the last episode. In a way, tying the knot seemed like a promise to the end of some of the significant problems they were having.

**4. The Revival Kind of Ending Similar to How the Show Started**
When Lorelei had to ask to use the franchise money for expanding the inn instead, it was so great because it was kind of like a parallel to _Gilmore Girls_ when Emily says that she and Richard would pay for Rorys Chilton education if they attended Friday night dinners. Only this time its two weeks in the summer and one week for Christmas with Luke. I mean I could see it.",24,31,False,self,,,,,

I found the perfect jacket, stole one of my husbands flannels and grabbed my Lukes coffee mug to complete the ensemble. 

I posted a picture on Instagram this morning next to a picture of Luke as a comparison and of course tagged Scott Patterson in it, in the hopes he would see it. 

Well HE LIKE MY PICTURE. I sound like a 10 year old, but I DON'T CARE. HE LIKED MY PICTURE. 

I'm fangirling so hard at work, I can't contain myself. I just had to tell people who would appreciate this. :)",14,173,False,self,,,,,
