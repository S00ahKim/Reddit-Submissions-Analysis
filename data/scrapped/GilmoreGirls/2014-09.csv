They've both cheated on boyfriends. Rory seems to think that the decisions of others are centered around her. Like when she yells at Logan's dad for sending him to London because the only possible reason she can think of is that he wants to take him away from her. 

Then Lorelai gives Luke an ultimatum on marriage because of something that's not in his control. His ex had every right to be uncomfortable about her daughter being around a stranger. Then she sleeps with Christopher without regard to anyone's feelings but her own. Then she gets mad when people call her out on it and ends up having a pity party about the problems that she herself created.

I love this show, but re-watching it, I'm realizing that they kind of suck as people.",9,2,False,default,,,,,

While I love the show, there are some things about it that make me feel really sad - so much so that I haven't watched it in a long time. We own the box set, but I can't start over again just yet.

Anyway... beyond the town I wish I lived in and all the kind people I wish I knew, I have definite feelings of love for Lorelai. While Lauren Graham is gorgeous, I don't know her. It's the character, really. And this isn't in a lusty way, as beautiful as she is. When she was sad or down, I want to be there for her. Even though she's not real, she's someone who makes me want to do better.
