sookie is TERRIBLE! she does not act responsibly throughout the entire show. some examples are:

* not cooking the right food for the lord of the rings kid's party and then blaming it on her pregnancy when the problem was really her ego about how good her food was
* not being a good business partner when the dragonfly inn was in construction
   * thinking it was okay  to skip picking up the expensive sink from canada because she ""fell asleep with davey"" when lorelai had been running around taking all the meetings and doing all the jobs, and lorelai couldn't have even done this job if she wanted to because sookie was the one with the sink criteria
* her refusal to drop lunch when the dragonfly inn had just opened because lunch was ""her thing"" and even went as far to pay kirk out of her own money to advertise lunch at the dragonfly inn which is SO IMMATURE and wasteful of money and resources, seeing as the money to pay the 7 other cooks and the food would have come from the dragonfly, not from sookie herself
   * also a note: not being able to fire 2 workers at the test weekend of the dragonfly because they were all ""too good""
* yelling at norman mailer for just ordering ice tea and then blaming that on her pregnancy 
* telling lorelai that she knew about her (lorelai's) kiss with luke because kirk told her and then luke confirmed it, even though luke asked sookie not to because they had literally just started their relationship
* when sookie showed up at lorelai's house on dean and rory's first date (when they watched willy wonka together) and stayed there even though lorelai firmly asked her to leave because she didn't want the situation to be even more awkward for rory
* all of sookie's ""quirkiness"" in the kitchen, aka her falling down, burning herself, cutting herself, etc. i get that a real life chefs do injure themselves when cooking but the amount of times it happened was less quirky and more extremely annoying in my opinion
* when she destroyed that high-end oven at the independence inn and acted like it was pretty much no biggie
* showing up to that food critic's house with her ""magic risotto"" and the ""right"" wine to prove that her risotto was fantastic even though the review the critic wrote was entirely positive

this list isn't everything but yeah. in my opinion the most egregious behaviour of sookie's was that she couldn't bother to be a responsible business partner and left all the hard work to lorelai (even asking lorelai to ask luke for money! who does that!), claiming that ""her part"" was just to cook. 

btw this is not hate on melissa mccarthy i think she's a great actress, just hate the character

**It's Just Like Riding a Bike** - Lorelai stops into Luke's diner for breakfast for the first time since their break-up, but finds they are awkward and uncomfortable together. Later, Lorelai's Jeep breaks down and she asks Luke to help her shop for a new car. While they look at cars, Lorelai and Luke's irritation with one another finally explodes into a fight, which Lorelai secretly takes as a good sign. Meanwhile, Paris gets accepted to numerous law schools and medical schools, and decides she must break up with Doyle so their relationship won't influence her choice of a graduate school. Finally, Rory gets a surprising letter that will have an impact on her future plans.

I finally did it. I watched season 7. Oh boy. I thought about giving up, I really did. I stayed on course and made it through Merry Fisticuffs and it got easier.  Im always gonna be a Lorelai and Luke shipper so it was weird to see her with Christopher but I guess we had to see them together once and for all to know for certain they were not for each other.  

I also agree with my initial assessment that having never watched season 7 made me like the revival more than I probably wouldve. Im getting ready to watch the revival post season 7 and I have some feels about it now.  I feel like the revival wouldve been season 7 tbh if ASP had been around for that season and that seems to also be the general consensus here I think?

Zach. I hate Zach. Lane got the shaft with Zach but there was a really sweet moment where Zach was demonstrating all the ways to carry and hold a baby with his mandolin and I thought why the hell did they make his character so stupid and hateable when they couldve written him soooo much better?  He went from vapid fuckboi to vapid husband and meh. I wanted so much more for Lane and Ive never understood her attraction to him.  

Season 7 did feel off from the other seasons and it was VERY noticeable for the first half but then it seemed like the show got back into the groove.  

Finally, it felt like some weird time travel stuff to watch season 7 for the first time in 2018.  Its weird because I never notice how dated some of the series feels when I re-watch. I try to remember my self in 2007 and why I stopped watching at the end of season 6. I cant remember why but its also wild to think I was 11 years younger and how different I was then compared to now.

**Unto the Breach** - On the eve of Rory's (Alexis Bledel) graduation, Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Herrmann) throw her a party and perform a song in her honor. At the party, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Christopher (David Sutcliffe) are reunited for the first time since their separation, and both are relieved to find they can still be friends. Logan (Matt Czuchry) surprises everyone at the party by proposing to Rory, but she is too shocked to give him an answer and begs Lorelai to help her decide what to do. On graduation day, Rory and Paris (Liza Weil) receive their diplomas, and Rory finally gives Logan her answer. Meanwhile, Lorelai is embarrassed about her karaoke serenade to Luke (Scott Patterson) the night before, and Luke is hurt when he overhears her saying it didn't mean anything.

Was it because the actress wasn't available? I thought it was strange we saw so little of her, when her story was very important in the original show. I know why Sookie wasn't featured as much, but it seems like Lane should have had some sort of story that was worth being told. I thought it was sad that there was no mention of how she felt about her life in Stars Hallow or how it was being a mom, I would have loved to see how her and Zack fair at PTA meetings or dealings with other parents in Stars Hallow (something I think would be right up ASP ally).

I think people think Lane's life ended up ""sad"" because no time was dedicated it what-so-ever, so I felt like her life was deemed ""unimportant"" by the show. The revival had a ton of ""extra time"" in my opinion that they could have easily dedicated 20 minutes to Lane. 

Re-watching the show, I think it is strange how little time is dedicated to Rory and Lane's friendship. When Rory was doing poorly at Yale, I thought Lane would have been a great person to tell Rory ""this isn't you"" when she met Logan, but instead it was Jess, who I'm not sure could really attest to what Rory was like anymore.

The love for ASP knows no bounds. She created these amazing characters and the charming, quirky town of Stars Hollow. And the standard narrative is that Season 7 was a disaster because she wasn't running the ship.

  
But I have to say, things were going off the rails well before Season 7, and frankly, the revival, while well-intentioned and ultimately entertaining, was just a hot mess story-wise. It's disappointing that a show that was so good Seasons 1-5 just went so far off the rails at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

While she's incredibly successful professionally, Lorelai is just stuck in the mud the entire series, with the exception of her success with the Dragonfly. On a personal level, she's a mess, constantly defining herself by her relationship dysfunctions, never really able to fully own who she is independent of whether she's with a man or not with a man. And the problem is, we see her engraining this in Rory very early on in Season 1 where Dean breaks up with Rory. What does Rory want to do? She doesn't want to wallow, she doesn't want to be ""one of those girls"" who pines after the boy who broke up with her. I'm always screaming at the TV in the scene where Lorelai is practically twisting Rory's arm to get her to wallow and be sad, as if her happiness is dependent on having a man in her life.

&amp;#x200B;

Because Lorelai's happiness seems to be completely dependent on having a man in her life, she's constantly second-guessing whatever man IS in her life, leading to her dysfunction with Max, Luke and Christopher.  


All of this actually was great fodder for drama in the early seasons, but Lorelai's complete inability to ""find"" herself over time is quite frustrating. But what's even more frustrating is how she projects all these qualities onto Rory, who has everything in the world going for her at the beginning of the series. But the same exact dysfunctions that Lorelai has we start to see in Rory. Her inability to share her feelings within her relationships. The constant need to please her boyfriend rather than standing up what's best for her (except at the VERY end where she says no to Logan).

&amp;#x200B;

I was really hoping ASP would have addressed all of these issues within the revival, but Rory and Lorelai spend 95% of the revival continuing their constant dysfunction, which is disappointing. Lorelai finally pulls out of it somewhat at the 11th hour, but Rory never really recovers before the final credits.  


The inability of ASP to create a redeeming story arc for both Lorelai in Rory, one in which they start believing in themselves independent of the need to have a man at the center of their life is the biggest disappointment about what is overall still an amazing show. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not to mention the horrible plot lines that were introduced as the show went on as ASP and team ran out of material, and the contrived plots used to create conflict between characters (see: April). I honestly liked the fact that ASP introduced a MAJOR rift between Lorelai and Rory in Season 6 but my god, did it last way too long. Uncomfortably long, especially if you consider that it was unfolding week by week on the CW, not as a binge-able show on Netflix. It felt like the two didn't speak to each other for like a full year. These and other story lines all began to feel so very forced, and ASP by the end of Season 6, the writers had dug holes so deep that no writing team could have expected to come in and extract the story without it feeling awkward. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, my favorite seasons will always be 2, 3, 1, 4 and 5, in that order, with 7 and 6 and the YITL coming in last by a long shot. I wish, I wish, I wish I could watch this show with my young daughter and point to Lorelai and Rory as examples rather than cautionary tales. But the fact is that at the end of the day, once you take into account their overall story arcs,  I just can't. Instead, it becomes a show about teachable moment after teachable moment that the characters themselves never really learn from.

Basically at the end of AYITL, Jess tells Rory to write a book about her relationship with Lorelai and their life / her childhood. When Lorelai tells Rory to 'drop the ""the"" ', the title of the book becomes ""Gilmore Girls"", the title of the show.

The theory goes that the first seven series of the show are told from Rory's perspective and that the only ""real"" thing is the revival, which is told from a third person pespective (or maybe Jess's, but that's another theory lol).

One of the main complaints (for me at least) about the revival, was the treatment of Rory's character. She was really selfish, extremely arrogant and awful with her relationships (cheating again, forgetting Paul). Also, dare I say it, but Rory and Lorelai were definitely less close in the revival, compared to their relationship in the first 7 seasons (obviously minus some of series 6 lol).

The theory argues that Rory has always been this way (selfish, arrogant, inconsiderate and not particularly intelligent - she couldn't get a real job even), and that the 'good girl', 'little miss perfect' Rory of the original series was just her embellishment of herself, since she was the narrator. She made herself, and her relationship with her mother, to be better than they really were.

And... are they reliable?

&amp;#x200B;

The revival paints a lot of characters in a more negative light than the OS.  Some have taken that to mean Rory white-washed herself and her loved ones in her telling of the OS.  That could be true - but why assume the AYITL is accurate?  Its negativity could be unreliable, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I propose, after Rory's book became a hit, someone decided to cash in with a sensationalized account of her ""real life.""  An unauthorized sequel, as it were.  It's total speculation, but I could see SandeeSays launching a series of articles based on interviews - some with people who were genuinely close to Rory, and some with people on the periphery.

&amp;#x200B;

Whoever wrote AYITL probably didn't know all of the characters very well, which is why some of them seem flattened or out of character.  Consider how sharp Luke is in the OS.  His oafishness in AYITL seems exaggerated - but that's exactly the kind of impression he makes on people when he's flustered or nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also why so much is left unanswered.  No motivation/ context is given for Rory and Logan's Vegas affair because they obviously wouldn't talk about it.  Instead, the AYITL author had to piece their story together from rumors and witness accounts (people who saw them eating lunch together, or saw Rory with the LoDB at a bar, or Naomi Shropshire swearing the male voice she heard on the phone could only belong to Logan Huntzberger).  This also is why we don't know if Lorelai told Christopher about her wedding.  Their relationship was probably important enough in Rory's book that readers wanted it addressed, but the AYITL author just couldn't find out.

&amp;#x200B;

This could even be used to explain why the show focused on random events like the musical (the AYITL author needed filler to make deadline) and the Wookie (some random guy swears he slept with Rory, and it's too juicy to ignore).

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, this isn't ASP's intent, but I think it's a fun theory to explain the discrepancies between the OS and the revival.  It's pure speculation, and there's probably a lot of other explanations that could work.  So what are your theories?  Who do you think wrote the revival and why?

I'm 38 now and have kids and a job and a husband and am just busy busy and GG just takes me back to a simpler time.

I'm surprised that his family went along with that whole farce. Surely they would find the whole thing highly suspicious.

I know a lot of people thought that Lindsay was unnecessarily cold towards Rory in season 3 but Dean had a tendency to completely ignore her whenever Rory walked into the room. In hindsight, she was right to feel threatened by Rory considering how far things escalated between Dean and Rory while he was married to Lindsay.

That is what Lorelie did with the letter she wrote for Luke, and was the beginning of the end of her relationship with Chris.

&amp;#x200B;

I found myself nodding for most of the ""saved"" entries and shaking my head in disagreement for a lot of the ""hurt"" entries.

&amp;#x200B;

Certainly, Lauren, Alexis, Kelly, Edward, and Scott are remarkable and were essential to the success of the show.  Liza and Keiko are treasures.  Milo brought a depth to Jess that weaker actors wouldn't have found.  Pretty much the only ""saved"" entry I'd disagree with is Jared.  He improved on the show, but he also started out kind of weak and played the character in a way that didn't quite gel with the narrative intent. I don't think he was terrible, but I would definitely not credit him with a show-saving performance.

&amp;#x200B;

For the negatives... I thought a lot of the arguments were stupid.  Scott Cohen's charm is the only thing that makes Max Medina kind of work; ditto for Tom Deluise as TJ.  And, as frustrating as the April storyline was, Vanessa Marano turned out a really good performance.  Those weren't bad casting calls - just weird characters/ storylines.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the **TL;DR** of the article is

&amp;#x200B;

*Good - Melissa McCarthy (Sookie), Kelly Bishop (Emily), Liza Weil (Paris), Edward Hermann (Richard), Keiko Agena (Lane), Jared Padalecki (Dean), Milo Ventimiglia (Jess), Scott Patterson (Luke), Sean Gunn (Kirk), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Lauren Graham (Lorelai)*

&amp;#x200B;

*Bad - Chad Michael Murray (Tristan), Sally Struthers (Babette), Vanessa Marano (April), Sebastian Bach (Gil), Michael Deluise (TJ), Danny Strong (Doyle), Alex Borstein (Drella &amp; Ms. Celine), Scott Cohen (Max Medina), Marian Ross (Gran and Cousin Marilyn)*",8,1,False,self,,,,,

Meanwhile, Lorelai and Luke have to look after Lizs daughter, Doula, for an extended period of time. Maybe a family crisis for TJ, I dont know. Although they had ruled our children, one of them starts to second guess this decision, especially as Lorelai is still grieving her father. This makes more sense than imagining that a couple in their forties never discussed kids, despite living together for 9 years. Again, please. They decide that theyre too settled, and will wait for Rory or April to DECIDE if they want kids. Foreshadowing! I forget if April was in the revival or not, but she would be university aged by now. Maybe she comes up work at the Dragonfly for a summer. 
6. Id also love to see a new, young cook that wants to make the inn a hotbed of 2016 food trends: nose-to-tail eating, wellness, kombucha etc. He or she could be horrified by Lorelais palate.

Michel is long gone.
7. Speaking of the townspeople, I would love to see Rorys generation taking over from Miss Patty, Babette, Taylor etc as the town organizers. None of the original characters are old, but theyve been replaced somewhat by younger, more modern ones. I can see Lane and Zach in a sort of Kirk role, where they teach the Stars Hollow kids, including their own, all the lessons available. Picture Zack as the dance teacher, soccer coach, martial arts teacher, Scout leader and a dozen other things each week. Lane runs music classes for toddlers and does tutoring. They both run a rock and roll fantasy camp in the summers, and keep the antique store going with Mrs Kim. 
8. Finally, Paris. Paris became a professor of biology or medicine at a middling school, which she is aggressively promoting as the next Yale. Id love to see her somewhere like a college town in Montana or Idaho. Picture her at the Chilton day, talking in cliches about the West being a breath of fresh air away from sissy East Coast elites etc. Doyle, in a cowboy hat, is managing the off-the-grid eco resort they manage in their spare time, which we see when Lorelai goes there on a Wild-inspired hike.

She's shocked and I think completely surprised that Rory would do something so immoral. I think Rory is embarrassed, but I'm not sure why she completely shuts Lorelai out the way she does. 

&amp;#x200B;

We see in earlier seasons this pattern Rory has of running off to the grandparents when things get tough for her. In season 1 we can see Emily's complete glee that Rory ran to her. In light of this pattern of behaviour, it's actually not surprising that there is such a rift between Lorelai and Rory in season 6. But is there actually any other way it could go? Rory does not handle not ""being perfect"" very well at all. I think she gets a lot of support and confidence from her mother, and when she feels criticised by her she completely overreacts.

They broke up for several episodes in season 1.  They fought about how much time she spent doing things for school, and his jealousy of Tristan.  At times, he called or visited so much it made her uncomfortable.  And he was clearly ambivalent about how much time she'd have for him if she went to school several hours away.

&amp;#x200B;

They also struggled with compatibility issues.  Dean appreciated Rory's passion for books, but never shared it and couldn't really discuss her writing with her in depth.  Seeing her all dolled up surrounded by Yalie men made him insecure enough to call it.  While it would be easy to chock that up to their history with Jess, I think it would've been an issue regardless.  I also think Dean's closeness to Lorelai -and his willingness to talk to her behind Rory's back - would've been a problem no matter what prompted it.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually come from a strict Asian household myself (I'm half asain, half white) so I can understand the ridiculous restraints and expectations put on Lane. But for her late teens and early adulthood to revolve around a storyline of rejection from her mother, literally being homeless, working at Luke's, a surprise pregnancy, and a confusing relationship with Zack (ummmm Dave who?) was literally the most disheartening aspect of Stars Hollow life. I don't view life as a situation where we all get what we dream of and maybe the writers were trying to showcase that through Lane, but I can't help but feel my heart go out to Lane's character every time I see her on screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lane was so knowledgable about music and her scheming skills to get past her mom throughout her teen years were covert-spy-opps level lethal. Perhaps she could have moved to New York (if her mom was going to kick her out anyway) and worked in a music shop to familiarize herself with the music scene and cast a better group of band mates (Hep Alien fans don't hate me). Or maybe gone the college route for music or business and have continued to pursue her rock band dreams alongside getting a degree? Okay, I'm sounding like my asain mom now ahaha. 

&amp;#x200B;

And don't get me started on the Revival's take on a 30-something Lane Kim still living at home, rocking out, and basically becoming her mom. \*lets out a long sigh\*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I believed that she was actually going to be touring with some highly successful internationally renowned band or that she was meant to have a corny plot line about a misunderstood girl who ends up achieving all her teenage dreams. Or that her adult life was objectively horrible-it wasn't.  But Lane deserved so much more.

I've just finished watching all of the show and the revival, for the first time, and I loved it!
I loved the close female relationships, the dialogue, the values, the foregrounding of family and personal studies/business ambition over romance. I identified with each of the Gilmore girls at different times.

But one thing bugged me: the treatment of pregnancy.
Lane got pregnant after having sex just once - that's rare. Lorelai knew exactly when she had conceived Rory - also rare.
And twice, Sookie only worked out she was pregnant from her mixed-up emotions or sense of taste. Both times she and Lorelai immediately reacted - without getting a pregnancy test from a doctor or even a Walmart!
It's like there was nowhere to buy a pregnancy test in all of Stars Hollow.

First time poster here. I finished the show a rough half year ago (revival and all) and I loved it all (despite some revival opinions in the sub) and Ive begun rewatching. 

One show im also watching currently is Buffy, which I also love to pieces. So while rewatching GG I thought to myself, how could a crossover work? 

In my opinion, both sides of the crossover would have to maintain their respective dynamic to work. Since Rory and Lorelai are so easily contained in their own routine and humor, and Buffy and the Scooby Gang are so involved in themselves and their work and secrecy (especially in s4) they could easily coexist with The Girls by encountering eachother in downtime. 

I think this could work pretty well. The Gang rids Stars Hollow of a threat behind the backs of its inhabitants, and vampires could feed exclusively on tourists, where the money comes from. This causes alarm with Taylor, as their town is becoming less of a hot spot for tourism and more for Vampires, Michel also noticing the decline in residents at the Inn. Only in the last 10 or so minutes would worlds collide, saving combat for Buffy but combining wit and banter during and after, a GG staple. 

Id probably call it The Girls and the Gang. And id watch the shit out of it. 

Thoughts? Opinions? Attacks on my character? Id love to hear them all. 

TL;DR Buffy and GG collide and their show dynamics create a wacky and funny adventure when the town of Stars Hollow faces a dark and hidden threat.

239,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2018-10-25,2018,10,25,1,9r1cok,self.GilmoreGirls,Dean's character in season one - do you think it changed? How?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/9r1cok/deans_character_in_season_one_do_you_think_it/,Bookbringer,1540399510,"I've seen several posts saying Dean was really smart, kind, and bookish in season 1, then got butchered/ dumbed down for season 2.  I'm wondering how many people agree with this take.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I don't see it.  Later seasons don't portray Dean as dumb, per se.  They just highlight his lack of interest in reading/ academics.  This seems pretty in line with his season 1 characterization.  Right off the bat, he treats Rory's frequent reading like a cute quirk.  He remarks on this several times as something unique to her.  When she mentioned getting a full set of encyclopedias for [Christmas](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/e0/d1/79e0d10c5c2d4b2191a45250a86c50c0.png), he didn't understand that was a good thing until she clarified she'd wanted them.  Book love, to Dean, was always a weird/adorable Rory thing, not a shared interest.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't to say Dean never read.  When they first started dating, he was willing and able to read at least two of Rory's favorite books.  However, it's clear he was doing that for her and didn't actually get into him.  He was never looking for book recommendations to pass the time; he just wanted to be closer to Rory.

&amp;#x200B;

I interpret his recommendation of Hunter Thompson in this light.  Some people took that to mean he was also a big reader, but I think if you're dating a big reader who keeps recommending books to you, recommending something back is a normal way to try to relate.  There's no other indications Dean read for pleasure, and even non-book-nerds read once and a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Dean's temper and jealous streak are other qualities that get mentioned.  While these become more apparent over time, they're definitely present in season 1.  Dumping Rory because she wouldn't say I love you, threatening Tristan at the dance, and getting upset when he saw Rory (then his ex) talking with Tristan at school, are all completely consistent with later developments.  Even little moments - his assertiveness with Lorelai on their first movie date, his unwillingess to stay out of Luke's after the break up kind of foreshadow later qualities.  Whether you think his reactions are disproportionate or justified, there's no denying they're intense.  Dean was always insecure about Rory and prone to outbursts.

&amp;#x200B;

Over all, I feel the only thing that really changed about Dean's character is which qualities were emphasized.  Since season 1 was mostly about showing what Rory saw in him, while season 2 was focused on showing what was missing in their relationship, it makes sense that our perception of him would shift as hers did.",13,1,False,self,,,,,

I think it would be Jess as they seem to be the most in sync with each other. I actually don't think Dean and Rory would have even contemplated dating each other due to how different they are. With Logan, it could go either way but I think she would be put off by his desire to get married and settle down after a while, no matter what age she is or what stage in her life she is in.",13,1,False,self,,,,,

Now I'm not saying that unrealistic writing doesn't exist on this show because yeah, it's a TV show and things are going to be written for drama like Luke completely cutting Lorelai off from his daughter, but there are a few things that people act like it makes their character a horrible person. 

For example Rory sleeping with married Dean. This was good writing. While yes it's certainly a bad thing to do, it realistic. It's human. People cheating with their high school girlfriend is something that happens in real life all the time. If we start saying that characters should never do anything wrong, then they wouldn't be human and there would be no show. I don't hate Rory because she made this huge mistake because you can see the real emotion and immaturity behind it which makes it real and compelling for me to watch. I can see a 19 year old girl struggling to come to terms with her feelings and making all the wrong choices. 

This was just one example and I'm not trying to bash anyone for their opinion, but I do feel like the characters should definitely be cut some slack sometimes. Life isn't pretty and we've probably all done things in our lives that people could point to and say they hate us for, I just hate when characters are bashed for being human. I would like to say though, that I totally get the sentiment of ""I just don't like this character as a whole human and wouldn't like them in real life, not just because of some things they did.""

I cant remember all the thoughts Ive had throughout the show since its been so long since we started, but here are a few:


team Jess, Logan, or Dean? I dont know if Im team any. Dean was the first boyfriend, but no one stays with their first boyfriend. He was a little possessive. I *loved* Jess as his character progressed, but would they have been a good match as Rory pursued her journalism career? I dont know. And Logan I had a hard time liking. He was too confident and proud, but he also had his own demons he was fighting. I think Rory did right in turning down his proposal. I would like to think that maybe later on she reconnected with Jess, after they both had success careers going.


I cant stand that a 30-yr-old woman cant do basic cooking. I understand that cooking isnt everyones gift, but you have a child, Lorelei. Feed her.


Lorelei and Luke all the way. Actually, Im more team Luke than I am team Lorelei. I find her very immature and selfish, so I pity Luke, but I like Luke. He holds his own against her. But at the same time, I think she and Chris could have worked out too. They shared so much history and background and private jokes and a daughter. 


April. What a weird storyline. Could we not? Thanks.


Lane and whats his name. Ive already forgotten. Nice enough guy in the end, but not really my first choice for her. 


the charm of Rory and Lorelei waned the last few seasons. They just kept making bad decisions, and I got tired of their tantrums and whining and selfish ways. And not the topic of charm, what is this spell that Rory has over the whole town? And over all men? I get that shes smart and pretty, but its a little much. At the end when the whole town threw her a going away party, I said to my husband, what makes Rory so special? Did any of the other girls in the town get jealous that no one threw them a party?


I think in addition to Rory and Lorelei getting more annoying at the middle to end of the show, I also missed the town. The show became more about life outside of Stars Hollow, and I really missed the town and people.

I view it as poetic. Now this may not be what Amy Sherman-Palladino intended, but this is how I interpreted it. 

Lorelai looked at Emilys life and decided that she didnt want that. So she got out of that and became an independent woman. She took care of and raised her daughter the way she saw fit. And even though she did kind of become like her mother (firing cooks, firing maids) she is under better circumstances. Meaning she turned her life around and made it how she wanted it to be, and she is happy. And so is Emily.

Lorelai gave Rory the 16 years of being single and going after something of purpose before getting pregnant that Lorelai didnt have. Now, Rory is under better circumstances than Lorelai was. Rory has the support of her mom and a great community surrounding them. 

Its not so much full circle. Its more like passing the baton Each generation has the chance to take their similar situation and make it better. And thats a great lesson for today. You dont have to agree with my viewpoint. However you interpreted it should stick with you. Just listen to other perspectives, and you may find something you didnt know you were looking for.

The main thing I liked between him and Lorelai was their history. They've known each other so well and they've shared so many memories and it was pretty nice. But the worst thing about this relationship and Chris' character in general - in my opinion - was actually the fact that he was Rory's father. I hate him for caring more about Lorelai than Rory and playing with her head, giving her attention only when he wants something to do with her mother. That was just horrible.

So I was thinking that maybe if Christopher wasn't Rory's father, but some high school friend of his and Lorelai, he would have been more likeable? I just think that plot like that would have a good potential and that would be better concurrence for Luke. 

Don't get me wrong, I kind of like Lorelai with Luke, but I ""ship"" them mostly, because if that's what Lorelai wants, so she should get it. However I got a little tired of them, because of their huge communication problem, which they don't seem to even try resolve (even after 10 years!), so it would be cool to have better option than Christopher.

Did he actually do something for his daughter or it was all to get to Lorelai? (or to impress Sherry when he was with her)? Why he doesnt go see rory when she's living with her grandparents and not speaking to her mom? ,45,1,False,self,,,,,

Strongest: Lauren Graham, Kelly Bishop, Melissa McCarthy and Matt Czuchry. Honourable mention to Liza Weil.

Weakest: No one struck me as particularly bad but I found Alexis Bledel to be quite hit and miss throughout the show's run. Jared Padalecki was weak in the earlier seasons but he definitely improved as the show went on.  I thought Keiko Agena had the tendency to overact at times but that might just be part of Lane's character who is overly extroverted.",47,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm going through a similar thing with my (hopefully not ex-)boyfriend right now. We had a huge fight and now he's ignoring me and blocked me everywhere and that scene just made me cry like crazy.,6,1,False,self,,,,,
