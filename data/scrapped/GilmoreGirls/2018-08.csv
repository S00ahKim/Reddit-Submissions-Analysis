**A Vineyard Valentine** - Knowing he has let too much time go by, Luke (Scott Patterson) is still unable to tell Lorelai (Lauren Graham) about the existence of his 12-year-old daughter, April (Vanessa Marano), and he is thrown into a panic when April wants to hang out with him at the diner. When April and Lorelai both show up at the diner and begin chatting, April innocently explains that Luke is her father. Lorelai tries to be supportive, even offering to postpone the wedding date, but Luke's reaction to this idea leaves her confused and hurt. Back at Yale, Logan (Matt Czuchry) takes unusual steps to win Rory (Alexis Bledel) back, and the newspaper staff rebels against Paris (Liza Weil) reign of terror at the Yale Daily News. Meanwhile, Stars Hollow holds its annual Winter Carnival, and Lorelai and Rory run a booth featuring their dog, Paul Anka, as a fortune teller.

Do Emily and Gipsy age? Like at all? Because they look absolutely the same. Luke doesnt seem that changed himself.

I loved seeing Javajunkie still together after the ten years and softly fighting like always, and living in Lorelais home and keeping Paul Anka... it felt homie and nice.

It got me to thinking about what Lorelai's wedding would have been like if she actually got married to Max. From the timing of their Harvard trip, it was going to be a late summer August wedding. The cake was also very floral and summery, and the chuppah was later adorned with flowers.

But I don't think this is very Lorelai. I'm with Emily in that I think a Russian Romanov Winter wedding would be perfect. Lorelai loves the snow, she loved the sleigh ride in season 2, and she looks great in winter colors.

Rory was very supportive with Paris dramas about Doyle. Paris tried (in her own way) to show the same support when she was dealing with Logans crazy actions of self-centering, etc.

I also believe Rorys friendship meant a lot to Paris, even though she will never fully admit it, but her presence was relevant and felt homie for Paris as they kept on studying at Yale and developing her future.

**Bridesmaids Revisited** - Proud parents Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Christopher (David Sutcliffe) attend a journalism panel at Yale where Rory (Alexis Bledel) dazzles the crowd. Afterwards, Lorelai offers to help Christopher (David Sutcliffe) out by babysitting his 3-year-old daughter and is horrified by the toddler's terrible behavior. The next day, Rory and Logan (Matt Czuchry) attend the wedding of Logan's sister, Honor (guest star Devon Sorvari). While helping the bride and her three bridesmaids get ready, Rory is devastated to learn how Logan spent his time during their recent breakup. Logan tries to defend his actions, but a devastated Rory turns to Lorelai and Paris (Liza Weil) for comfort. Finally, Lane (Keiko Agena) is still heartbroken over Zack (guest star Todd Lowe), until he turns up at the diner with a surprise.

I can't remember a scene where they actually manage to finish the huge amount of takeout they get. The only times they actually finish their meals are at Emily and Richard's house, and I am pretty sure Emily's dinners are pretty healthy.

At the end of the day, it comes down to calorie consumption. Throughout the series, it is implied and even explicitly mentioned that Lorelai and Rory live on the leftovers they ordered days ago. When they don't eat takeout, they eat at Luke's -- yet they hardly make a dent in whatever they order.

For those arguing that Lorelai and Rory don't exercise, they are shown to almost always be on their feet. Exercise doesn't always have to be planned or at the gym. You can burn a lot of calories just walking around all day. Lorelai manages two inns throughout the series and is always running around to ensure everything is in order. Rory attends Chilton and Yale, both huge schools, so she would be walking around a lot. Most people I know who've attended college lose weight, even though they can't always eat healthy -- because of the number of calories they burn getting to and from classes.

Also, they drink a lot of coffee, which is an appetite suppressant. I think they take their coffee black far more than they add sugar, cream, and/or milk.

Good genetics and high metabolisms are also valid factors. Some people can truly eat anything without gaining too much weight.

Just to clarify, I'm not defending their eating habits at all. It's really, really unhealthy and sometimes even frightens me. I also think that it is pretty hypocritical of them to make fun of overweight people, when they are so unhealthy. I just wanted to point out that I don't find it all that unrealistic.

I just thought it was a nice metaphor for marriage today. Women, and Men, no longer get married because they need to. They can kayak along just fine.

Winter wasnt actually that bad I enjoyed it and compared to both Summer and Spring it was the best one. Now, Spring bored me a little, I didnt care about most of the things, the Gay Parade idea couldve been great, but Summer was something else.

Summer sucked so much. The revival is literally tearing everything apart: 

- we waited until season 4, almost 5, for Javajunkie. We get it, they break up, they get back together in the FINALE, and what couldve been a great 10 years later relationship with them being happy, stable, with absolute 0 drama, turns into ANOTHER fight. im tired
- the Rory and Logan thing. We got enough of Logan already. Theyre not doing the right thing, Logan is engaged/married/whatever and its all so messed up. 
- Sookie left the inn. I didnt like her but man, thats sad. And now Michel. He was the soul of the inn I LOVED him and now its only Lorelai. The essence is just not there anymore

And I was really hoping to see much more of Emily Gilmore dealing with Richards death but in a healthy way. Going to therapy was actually a wise idea and she couldve gotten a lot of help out of it. But instead they decide to add Lorelai and make everything into a pointless fight again.

Although Lorelai (Lauren Graham) refuses to admit that she is upset, Rory can tell that she is bothered by the news that Luke (Scott Patterson) will be gone for a few days on a field trip with his daughter, April (Vanessa Marano, who does not appear in the episode). Against Lorelai's wishes, Rory pays a visit to the store owned by April's mother, Anna (guest star Sherilyn Fenn), to spy on her. Meanwhile, when Zack (Todd Lowe) finally works up the courage to ask Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda) for permission to marry Lane (Keiko Agena), he is surprised at the deal she makes with him.

So overall I LOVED it. I loved that Jess appeared (only a few minutes but worse is nothing), I loved that Emily sold the house and bought a new one where she feels better and can start a new life and step by step move on. I love that she abandoned the DAR, those women annoyed the hell out of me. 

Im not sure if people liked the beginning of the episode where Lorelai does Wild but I found it really fresh and original to see her alone and dealing with the hiking stuff; it was fun. Also when she calls Emily and tells her the story, I adore these moments between them when they behave just like mother and daughter, its nice so see some of those from time to time. And it made me cry.
So when she comes back and faces Luke and he makes the longest and most beautiful speech hes ever done, well my heart melted and I was so happy. Im glad theyre finally getting married. Took them a lot but honestly, theyre meant to be, always have been, and Im relieved they end up together for real and not just in my imagination.

I love Emily, I always have, and I appreciate it a lot that theyve given us a bit more of her, moving on and selling the house, it was a big brave step she took. 

I couldnt care less about Sookies comeback. Felt unnecessary to me.

Also, Lorelai wanting to expend the Inn is great. Its genuine of her to want to keep Michel and do it with Lukes money (we never knew if he knew about that) as long as he didnt want it, because I really believe Richard wouldve felt honored anyhow.

And last but not least, what the f*ck happened with the last four words?!?!?!?!? That I am mad about. The father is Logan (seems too obvious, maybe?) but the revival was suppose to clarify everything not to leave any more doors opened... 

So as a sum up: Fall &gt; Winter &gt; Spring &gt; Summer

We all know of the episode 4 ""Chicken or Beef?"" where Dean is getting married and gets drunk and starts saying ""Rory"" and gets saved by Luke. There are also the episodes that I can't remember that establishes Dean is bored of married life (eg. him playing the video games in the arcade after dinner).

It seems to start in episode 14 ""The Incredible Shrinking Lorelais"". Rory went to the inn to try to find Lorelai there. Instead, she finds Dean and starts telling him all of the drama happening to her. He stays there to be a literal shoulder to cry on.

Skipping ahead to episode 17 ""Girls in Binkinis, Boys Doin' the Twist"", we find out that Rory has his cell phone number. We find out in the season 5 episode 1 ""Goodbye to Daisy Miller"" that this is Dean's work cell phone. It's not the number that he had throughout high school, so this is highly suspicious.

Not a direct interaction between the two, episode 18 ""Tick, Tick, Boom"" includes the scene where Rory bad mouths Lindsay to Lane about how Dean is suffering because of her wants.

Next, we have episode 21 ""Last Week Fights, This Week Tights"". Rory is stranded at a bar in Hartford with no one to pick her up. She calls Dean. Instead of just taking her to her dorm, they eat for a while. They, then, walk around an abandoned Yale talking just like they did in Season 1 (about books and where she sat in classes). This is the episode after Lindsey and Dean have the public fight where Lindsay is wanting to go out with him and have fun. ""Last Week Fight, This Week Tights"" is also the episode where people seem to bother Rory for not being in a relationship all year long.

This all comes to a head in episode 22 ""Raincoats and Recipes"" where the physical affair starts, but I guess the main thesis is that the entire season has been leading up to the Rory and Dean having the physical affair.",13,38,False,self,,,,,

I've seen people her say that Christopher sometimes uses meeting Rory as an excuse to see Lorelai.

In this episode, Christopher and Lorelai kind of get back together while things with Sherry are uncertain. At Sookie's wedding, Emily and Lorelai talk about Christopher's return and I thought their dialogue was interesting:

'EMILY: What on earth is Christopher doing here?

LORELAI: Um, well, hes visiting his daughter.

EMILY: Thats very nice.

LORELAI: Yeah. Actually, hes been visiting his daughter quite a bit lately.

EMILY: Really?

LORELAI: Yes. In fact, Mom, you might be seeing a lot more of Christopher from now on.

EMILY: Because hell be visiting his daughter?

LORELAI: Yes, hell be visiting his daughter.'

Both of them say Christopher's going to visit his daughter more often with the implication of him getting back together with Lorelai and potentially staying there. It might just be an innocent coincidence or I'm reading too much into this; but it's almost as if they know that he uses Rory to see Lorelai, or his 'visiting his daughter' excuse is just that -- an excuse.

I don't think Christopher wants to stay out of Rory's life completely, but he treats her more like a friend than Lorelai does (who can act like a mother when she needs to). I think Christopher saw Rory as another upside to being with her mother but his intention was always to win Lorelai over.",5,10,False,self,,,,,

It makes me question if I was too unforgiving towards the revival. I still stand by a lot of my opinions (I'm looking at you, horrible Stars Hollow musical), but I don't know if I took the care to watch the revival with a grain of salt. Not only was 2016 wildly different than 2007 in terms of sociopolitical atmosphere, but ASP basically had to pick up where a bunch of other random writers left off, and it can't be easy to consolidate your vision with the shrapnel that was season 7 and come up with something new.

**The Real Paul Anka** - Lorelai (Lauren Graham) has a bizarre dream in which singer/songwriter Paul Anka has a cameo role. Meanwhile, although Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Logan (Matt Czuchry) are back together, Logan is miserable knowing that Rory hasn't really forgiven him, and he takes off with his friends for another stunt with the Life and Death Brigade. Rory accepts Jess' (guest star Milo Ventimiglia) invitation to attend an open house at his new book store/art gallery/publishing house in Philadelphia. While there, she is surprised to run into Luke (Scott Patterson), who is accompanying his daughter April (guest star Vanessa Marano) on an academic field trip. Back in Stars Hollow, Lorelai is horrified to find that Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) have been looking at real estate in her town.

Dean, Jess, Logan, (Paul), or someone completely new? A lot of this of course depends on what Rory will do with her child, keep it or not and also if she will tell the father or not.


At this point I think the Dean-ship has sailed and is long gone. As we heard in the revival, he apparently has like 4 kids and a wife. It was obvious that they didn't have those feelings for each other anymore all though they did still remember the part of their life where they were together. There is also almost no way that Dean is the father because they most likely never slept together anywhere near that time in revival.


Now Jess... Many have theorised that he is ""Rory's Luke"". I'd be down for that. I know that there is basically no chance that Jess is the father but there is also a chance they have at least some feelings for each other. After they were together as teens both have changed _a lot_ and where Rory used to be the one guiding Jess, now she seeks that from him. I have also seen many comments about Jess being too good for Rory now and I somewhat agree. But, at the same time I remember that Rory was lost, very lost, during her semester off Yale. Not the exact same but similar to what Jess was feeling during the earlier seasons. Both push each other to be better and challenge each other intellectually. Even career wise they end up in similar places. And that scene in the end where Jess looks through the window at Rory... Maybe it's just a memory of old times or a feeling of what could've been but even if it is a moment of closure, it was pretty something.


Logan is most likely the father, yes. But as I previously mentioned, it could be that Logan is ""Rory's Christopher"". And even if not, I don't see Rory getting married to Logan. I do like him and he fits well with Rory but they just weren't on the same page. Just like Christopher and Lorelai, it was more one-sided. Rory didn't accept the ring nor did she postpone the wedding or getting engaged. She just didn't feel it. And on top of that Logan was getting married to someone else. He did bring thrill into Rory's life but that was just it. It was more lust than love.


I kind of even hope that the baby is not Paul's. Rory didn't even remember the dude. It could be, more chance than the father being Jess, but I doubt they went that far if Rory even forgot that he was at Luke's while she was there too.


I've been thinking about Rory's one night stand and how it is possible that the father is actually that dude's. Could be. It makes sense if you take that scene with Christopher and Rory into consideration.

It would've been nice to know at least someone from Emily's family, even someone who could rib her without being a Trix type (a.k.a, that same ASP sharpness that permeates the dialogue of Lorelai, Emily, Paris, or Trix).

With the original show and the revival, what does everyone think of the pair? Are they the main reason you watch the show, or is it because of the cozy feeling it gives, where problems are never as dramatic as, say, *How to Get Away with Murder.* I know that's why I watch it. That and my love for Lorelai. 

I see a lot of people saying that they don't like Lorelai, but is that the majority? Personally, for me, I think she's a wonderful character, since she's just so strong and really takes care of those she loves. The only thing that makes me annoyed of her sometimes is how defensive she gets of Rory. She has no issue snapping at others, like Jess, Logan, her mom, etc., but when it's her daughter, I feel like she babies her. Especially with the revival, you would THINK she would have at least a little bit of a problem with her daughter cheating with/on someone...(the whole 'Who's Paul?' thing was so unfunny and out of character for Lorelai and Luke, I think).

My theory is that Lorelai lets Rory get away with things because Rory has a habit of cutting her out whenever she disagrees with her, and she doesn't want to lose her daughter, or have the type of relationship she has with Emily. Her own mother is critical, so she tries to be the exact opposite.

**The Long Morrow** - Picking up on the day after last season's finale, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) wakes up in bed with Christopher (David Sutcliffe). Confused and mortified, she makes a hasty exit, ignoring Christopher's pleas that she stay. Once at home, Lorelai tries to get rid of everything that reminds her of Luke (Scott Patterson) and ends up practically emptying her house. Rory (Alexis Bledel) receives a toy rocket ship as a parting gift from Logan (Matt Czuchry) and is baffled as to its meaning. She decides she should join him in London for the summer, only to learn he has bought her a ticket for a visit at Christmas. Kirk (Sean Gunn) and Taylor (guest star Michael Winters) cause a bizarre accident that damages Luke's diner. Finally, Luke shows up at Lorelai's door and asks her to elope.

I've never posted to this sub before but, while it makes sense, I was really surprised by all of the Rory hate.

I have not had the charmed life that she had by any stretch. My way was never paid in any capacity, and I was always encouraged (and always did) to work hard and take pride in the things that I earned, but I always got the impression throughout the season that a lot of the entitled behavior that she went on to exhibit was enabled by the people around her (with the exception of Lorelai in most cases).

Any time she ran into any issue with Lorelai she went straight to her grandparents, who encouraged this wholeheartedly and gave her anything she wanted. What teenager wouldn't? Throughout my life I've seen the effect that this has had on young people as they have grown into adults, and it made a lot of sense.

Logan didn't help at all. He was really charming and kind to her throughout the series, and in many ways to he encouraged her to make good career choices, but I personally viewed every other aspect of their relationship as ""Let's do a really bad thing because I'm confused like all young adults are, Logan!"" -&gt; ""Okay! My life is meaningless and predetermined and daddy will always bail me out! :)""

Beyond that, I don't want to get too much into her romantic relationships, but I don't think Lorelai was a shining example of how healthy relationships should operate. She did really well early on trying to avoid romantic relationships when Rory was younger, which I think was the right decision, but beyond that it began getting a bit iffy, especially with the Christopher shit. Things happen in life and they aren't necessarily anyone's fault, but they still have an impact on the people who watch and learn from you.

It really hurt to see what happened to her in the special on a personal level. I'm much younger than her, but I had a period where I was also much worse off than she was. I don't want to go into much detail beyond that. I understand the lack of direction wholeheartedly, the ""homelessness,"" etc. It really, really sucked and I wanted a lot more from her, so I see why, especially at her age, people would resent her given all of the opportunities that she had. At the same time, I think people have forgotten that you are the company you keep, and she was involved in a lot of relationships over time that sent her a lot of different signals and taught her a lot of different things.

Thanks for reading my blog post. This does not excuse her behavior as an adult on an objective basis and I don't know if this would fall under Rory apologism, lol.

I know I know, people have said that Rory was stronger in some subjects and stuff, but this is my reasoning-

There is NO WAY paris could have ever gotten anything less than an A in a class. Which means she must have gotten straight As, making her the best in the class automatically. Most GPAs arent THAT affected by + or no +, so even if she didnt get A+s, she still did good.

When Rory first comes to Churchill, she got a D on her paper and then didnt get to take the test (she did get extra credit, but that couldnt have made up for the test that much). With that grade, she couldnt have gotten more than a B or A-. 

Automatically, that puts Rory behind. I just know that paris couldnt have ever gotten less than an A. 

Also, since Rory went to stars hollow high freshmen year, and they were always putting it down, Pariss gpa must have been better at Churchill with weighted classes and APs that stars hollow doesnt offer. 
 
I know... its just a show! I just always found it rather annoying that Rory somehow became valedictorian and Paris didnt.

After Lorelai and Luke break up in Partings, Lorelai turns to Chris for comfort and they sleep together.  I'm curious what ASP would've done with this storyline for season 7?

&amp;#x200B;

Rosenthal decided to have Lorelai come clean right away, reaffirm that she and Luke were over, and play out a serious relationship with Chris, before ending on friendly terms with Luke.  What would ASP have done differently?

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine her having Lorelai and Chris actually get married.  And I wonder if her plan was to milk the tension between the three a bit longer, or if her version of season 7 would've started with Lorelai telling Luke, and that being the end of them.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing, I thought... I was remembering how sometimes when Lorelai and Rory's relationships parallel each other, they're not in the same role.  When Lorelai sleeps with Chris and Rory kisses Jess, it's Jess and Lorelai who think they'll finally get with someone they've wanted, while Rory and Chris wind up staying with their current partners.

&amp;#x200B;

If Lorelai got back together with Luke, she and he could be in a similar position to Rory/ Logan and the bridesmaids - even down to the excuse that it was just comfort since she'd known Chris since they were kids.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it would've been horrible and stressful, but definitely narratively interesting if they had gone that route.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else had any thoughts on what ASP's season 7 might've been for Luke, Lorelai, and Chris.",29,10,False,self,,,,,

After Rory goes to college it just becomes harder and harder to watch. It makes me so sad. This was my comfort show, where nothing is super dramatic or painful to see. It's set in a cozy town with eccentric characters that are quirky but overall mean well. I love Lorelai but I just...ugh. I wish I didn't hate Rory so much. It's so unbearable to see who she has become. I could have ignored the revival, just pretend that it didn't exist, only she sucks in the OS too. 

I miss Chilton Rory. At least she was just a simple kid back then. Obviously I like seeing flawed characters - Emily and Paris and Jess are my favourites, and everyone knows they aren't perfect at all. Not even close. But they receive consequences, they get told when they suck, so when they don't it's easier to appreciate when they shine. Rory? Lol. She doesn't care about anyone's feelings. On the surface she's usually polite, but leaving Emily and Richard without a goodbye or thank you? YIKES. 

Rory is acting like they were so awful to her, when it's completely normal for your GRANDPARENTS who you are living with for FREE to have rules for you. Jeez. They mostly let her do her own thing but the second they disagree with her, she acts like they're some awful dictators or something. All Emily wanted was for Rory to tell her that she wasn't going to be home, it's normal for her to be worried. Rory acts like she was some monster for going through her address book. She was just worried about her. 

And the whole no sex thing. YES, Rory is an adult that can make her own choices, but it's so normal for grandparents to not exactly be for premarital sex. Most of the people I know were not allowed to have sleepovers with their boyfriends (kind of had to work around it). So I don't know why Rory was like ""oh no they're so controlling"" lol. I guess she's not used to having figures in her life that actually act like parents (no shade to Lorelai obv I love that lady) but even then, they didn't really overhear her. Emily and Rory had like 2 disagreements/snappy conversations and she just left like it was ww3. 

She completely disregarded how nice they were to her the majority of the time, the job they got her, how they decorated the pool house for her, her own POOL HOUSE, how they fed her every single day and threw her an extravagant birthday party. Even if the 'Rory' drink tasted bad, it's the thought that counts. Emily was so good to Rory the majority of the time and she's acting like a spoiled brat. I just can't over how she didn't even say goodbye or thank you to either Emily or Richard. Disgusting. 

Rory's conversation with Lorelai about them made me so mad. ""I don't want to be under their thumb"" blah blah blah. I literally wanted to yell shut up at her. She told Logan that most people would die to be in his position, well, back at you, Rory. Slightly less privileged than Logan and acts like she's got no help. It makes me sick. 

I just wish Lorelai acted more like a parent to Rory sometimes. She saw her mother cry over this. That's why I'm so sad about the show. It's hard to watch when a main character acts awful and the other main character just wants her time and attention over anything else. 

Sorry for the long rant. I'm just a disappointed fan lol. ",98,100,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Lorelai's First Cotillion** - When Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) have no real reaction to the news of her break up with Luke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai (Lauren Graham) suddenly realizes that most of her emotional life has been based on doing and feeling the opposite of whatever her parents want. Later, when Michel (Yanic Truesdale) forces Lorelai to attend Emily's beautiful cotillion dance, Lorelai discovers that some things her parents wanted for her weren't really that terrible. Rory (Alexis Bledel) has a tough time making her long-distance relationship with Logan (Matt Czuchry) work. After taking Rory out for a father/daughter dinner, Christopher (David Sutcliffe) makes a startling confession to Lorelai.

Then all of the sudden she's offered a promotion, which would mean even more responsibilites and even more money. Its the kind of job she always wanted but she doesn't want it. The thought of accepting it makes her sick. She's also in a serious relationship with an investment banker. Another workaholic. They hardly see each other but they both know how important their jobs are to each other. But then Rory starts to change and as she starts to question her job, she also starts questioning her relationship. He doesn't know how to deal with all of that since he met her when she was a super focused career woman and now she's kinda... flailing.

Lorelai &amp; Luke: Lorelai and Luke are legally married and have one son, Richard Junior who was born around 2009. They are married though haven't had their dream town wedding because they've been raising a child and Lorelai has been slowly but surely expanding the inn. There are at least three Dragonfly Inns on the east coast. Richard Junior is about to start school that coming fall and while Luke wants him to attend Stars Hollow Elementary like he did, Lorelai wants him to go to a more private elite school. She realizes that she is being like Emily in the sense that she wants him to go to a private school and resents it but she knows that its what would be best for him. Emily is backing her up on this. 

Luke still has the diner and nothing really changed about that. Though he's struggling with his relationship to April. When she comes to town Luke has only eyes for Richard Junior.

Emily: I really wouldn't change anything about Emily's storyline.

KIRK: Well, I modeled my poll after the Gallup poll. The Gallup poll uses a sample of 1,005 voters to represent the 280 million people of the United States. Using that logic, the correct sampling size of the town of Stars Hollow would be 0.002. Rounding that up means one person needs to be polled, so I picked me.

The system he is using would be that 1,005 is 0.00000003589286....(3.589e-8) percent of 280,000,000.

Therefore, depending on how he rounded the population of Stars Hollow is somewhere between 556 and 835.

556 x (3.589e-8/100)= 0.0019956

835 x (3.589e-8/100) = 0.0029971",21,35,False,self,,,,,

**The Great Stink** - Logan returns to town on business to acquire an internet company and pays Rory a surprise visit. Rory is thrilled, but during a dinner with Logan's colleagues, she realizes that she has no connection to his new business world, and is especially threatened by one of his beautiful co-workers. Emily and Richard are delighted when Lorelai and Christopher attend Friday night dinner together as a couple. Christopher reveals that Sherry has written him a letter saying she regrets leaving their daughter, GG, and asking him to send GiGi to visit her in Paris. Lorelai can't believe that Chris would consider this and they get into an argument over dinner. Meanwhile, Stars Hollow is plagued by a terrible odor when a train with a full load of pickles derails, and Taylor refuses to pay for the cleanup.

Wtf. She brutally rejects Jess (it was summer break so what would have been so bad if she went away with him for a while, it wouldn't have impacted her education) then crawls back to what feels 'safe and familiar' like a little weakling. She only starts running back to loser Dean when people start telling her that she's been single too long, so clearly it's an act of desperation. Not only is Dean pathetic for how he treats Lindsay, but the whole situation is too. What's worse is when Rory calls him ""my Dean"", it sounds so icky, like she's a battered woman who can't see how wrong Dean's (and her) actions were. 
Honestly, she should've lost her virginity to Jess, they had way more intense feelings for each other. At least if she lost it to Jess, she'd only have to come to terms with actually losing her virginity. But with Dean, she also had to think about how terrible the situation was in which she did. It was all so wrong and uncomfortable. In this instance, Dean treated Rory worse than how Jess treated her at Kyle's party. He placed a burden on her as the 'other woman'. Jess did not tarnish Rory but Dean did, what's worse is that she let him. Season 3 Rory was way stronger than season 4 Rory. ",59,75,False,self,,,,,
