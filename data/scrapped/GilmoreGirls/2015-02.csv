Like Tristan, Logan was a badboy/playboy who for some reason against his own will, falls for Rory. The push/pull dynamic settles, and eventually we see that story line play out as Rory is able to ""tame"" the bad boy character. Pretty sure Amy Palladino felt that story line needed to be finished, to show Rory's capabilities within a relationship in a ""lion falls in love with a lamb"" dynamic, which brings her love stories into full circle- Dean, the guy who likes her too much but is beneath her and would leave her bored, Jesse, the asshole who treats her like dirt... The badboy storyline was sorely missed. I felt they tried to bring a lot of the ""tristan"" qualities to Jesse but without the wealth/privilege dynamics that would play out with the grandparents, etc, another Tristan dynamic was needed. 

The dynamic of Tristan/Rory is far better than Logan/Rory, however, due to CMM's more subtle acting. The guy playing Logan just seemed... there. But it might have been the stale writing at that point. 

Chad Michael Murray was far superior in his role as Tristan than Logan. It would have been amazing to have had him reprise Tristan should the series continued, with both of them having learned from their relationships past. ",23,26,False,self,,,,,

She was pretty and smart to almost an annoying degree.
I am currently Rory's age now that she was when she first heard Mitchem's criticisms about her incapacity to truly be a journalist (20 or so) and I can't stop thinking about it. She completely crumbled under the first criticism she had truly heard in her life.

When we examine Gilmore Girls looking back, the general consensus seems to be a bit different than what we were saying at the time. Looking back, it's clear that Lorelei had clearly sheltered and praised Rory to the high heavens and as Stars Hollow's Great White Hope, she never felt the reality of her situation. It was only through competition with Paris that she truly excelled at whatever she was doing, but the drive to succeed never seemed like a hunger. In short, I don't think Mitchem was too far off in his criticisms. Was he tactless? Yes. Was we wrong? No. 

I've had my own share of failures early on, but with similar credentials from a similar high school. My aspirations were similar. Had I been told to my face that my aspirations were unreachable, I would have reacted in a very different way. Simply because my upbringing was so different. Expectations for me were sky high and yet I never seemed to fulfill them. Somewhere down the road I became hungry and angry. Had I heard those words?

I know a lot of people here like to talk about how self absorbed, privileged, and inconsiderate Lorelai and Rory are, and trust me, I'm right there with you. I think they're pretty realistic though, and that's always comforted me in a way. ""Hey, even despite how intelligent, articulate, attractive, and accomplished these ladies are, man, they really don't have their shit together either!""  
Luke and Lorelai's breakup in season 5 has always resonated deeply emotionally with me. I agree, she's a jerk and shouldn't have lied (repeatedly, both openly and through omission) about drinking with Christopher after his father's death, she should have responded when Luke said he was all in, she should have given him his space when he needed it. But...who hasn't unintentionally sabotaged a relationship with someone, by being too cautious and not vocalizing you returned their feelings fully, or by being too aggressive and not giving them space? I know I have, and I actually think I'm a pretty decent partner in relationships. 

So as much as my heart breaks for Luke, particularly in the subsequent episodes, Lorelai's dream *(""Say something. Say something!)* and her phone call to him rambling about The Way We Were always kind of bankrupted me emotionally, because I could empathize. Well, last night I was having a movie marathon and stumbled across The Way We Were on TV. Oh my gosh. I get it now, I thought I got it, but man, did I not comprehend how similar their situation was to Katie and Hubbel and her post breakup call and needing her *best* friend. She's right about the scene about putting the books away too, such a small scene, but so much gravity to it. 

Amy and the other writers did such a fantastic, intricate job on developing these characters interests, and I think the cast did a damn good job portraying them. Just wanted to offer a non vent here for once, and strongly suggest anybody who hasn't seen The Way We Were does so, it's absolutely worth it. ",12,36,False,self,,,,,
