I also think it might be the longest back and forth that is THIS hysterical. They go through multiple scene changes and I laugh hysterically through 98&amp;#37; of it. I wanted to cut it just to make it shorter, but I can't. It's all just too good.   


&gt; LORELAI: Well?  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: What?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: You notice anything?  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Anything?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Anything weird, anything different?  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: About Luke?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Of course about Luke. Did you notice anything different?  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Like what?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Like a vibe, an attitude. Did he look at me differently?  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Differently than what?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Differently than he did.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Differently than he did when?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Before.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Before what?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Before before. Rory!  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: How on earth can you be frustrated with me right now?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Fine. Come here.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Lorelai hurriedly pushes Rory out the diner door.\]  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: What's your damage, Heather?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: I think I'm dating Luke.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: What?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: I'm not sure. It's just a possibility. I could be wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: But how? When?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: I went with him to his sister's wedding, and it was really nice. We had a really good time. We laughed a lot, and we ate, and then we danced.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Danced? How?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: We pop\-locked.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Was it a fast dance, slow dance, group dance?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: It was a slow dance. What is ""group dance?""  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: The hustle, the hora.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: No hustle, no hora. It was a slow dance \-\- a waltz. Luke can waltz.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Luke can waltz?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Luke can waltz.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Look how you just said, ""Luke can waltz.""  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: What, I'm just saying, I'm surprised that Luke can waltz.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: That sounded more like, ""I'm surprised I still have my clothes on.""  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Oh, stop.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: What else happened?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Nothing. We spent the evening together. We danced, he walked me home, then he asked me to a movie. All of these things individually do not add up to dating, but together, I don't know. And there was this moment, when he walked me home, where I thought \-\- I don't know  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Did you say yes?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: When?  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: To the movie. Did you say yes?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: That sounds like dating to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: But maybe he didn't mean it as a date thing. Maybe he just needed to get out of the house, and since I'm currently one of the women sitting home, thinking, ""If I could only find a man like Aragorn,"" he picked me.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Okay, whoa, this is Luke.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Our Luke \-\- the town Luke. We see him every day. He's a part of our lives.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: I mean, everyone will know. They'll know if you're together, they'll know if you're not together.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: You can't just date Luke. When you're with Luke, you are with Luke. And if it doesn't work out, it will be really bad for both of us. I mean, how do you feel about this? Do you want to be dating Luke?  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Okay, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I don't even know if this is what he's thinking. This could be a totally innocent situation, and then we've done all this what\-iffing for nothing. Let's just go back in there and see if anything's weird, okay?  
&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Okay.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Okay. \[they re\-enter diner\]

&gt;RORY: That was a little weird. 

&gt; LORELAI: Well, the lines are crooked, the printing's all sloppy. Harvard, Princeton and Yale cannot see them looking like that.

&gt;  
&gt;RORY: All three of these places probably have the same number.  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;RORY: Two?  
&gt;

1,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2018-6-1,2018,6,1,10,8nnt0c,self.GilmoreGirls,The Pros of Season 7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/8nnt0c/the_pros_of_season_7/,SlutRapunzel,1527815270,"HI GUYS! Long-time watcher of the show, I remember hurrying home from school to catch the latest rerun back in 2003. I've watched the show through MAYBE a thousand times, the ""dreaded"" Season 7 included.

But you know what? There's too much negativity in this world, and I want to bring a LITTLE light into it. 

I know it gets a lot of hate, but I've always felt this was somewhat undeserved since OBVIOUSLY nobody can replace Amy Sherman Palladino, and David S. Rosenthal was put in a VERY difficult position of having to write the final season. Upon my recent rewatch, I decided to keep a list of things that happen in season 7 that are actually PLEASANT and would like to relay them here. 

So, HERE WE GO! Things in Season 7 that work:

* **Zach stops being an asshole.** The devastation that is Lane's life aside (settling for a dumbbell with no redeeming qualities and getting knocked up, not being able to enjoy sex, etc), at LEAST there is some redemption for Zach's character. The episode where Lane is about ready to pop and he's caring for her and giving her foot massages, asking how often she's peed, helping her carry her bags, etc, was REALLY sweet. He's still a gigantic idiot, but at least he's not ""THIS IS MY STAGE, EVERYONE FUCK OFF"" terrible. He's the best he's ever been in Season 7.

* **This also goes for Logan.** Look, love him or hate him, we can all agree Logan is a manipulative playboy who talks his way out of trouble and almost always gets his way (except with his dad). BUT IN SEASON 7! Some redemption for his character! He's building his business, making deals, and acting quite well as a boyfriend to Rory. He takes chances and when his business endeavors fails, he gathers himself up and moves forward again. I found this admirable behavior. And while you shouldn't propose to your girlfriend in front of tons of people without knowing for sure if she would say yes, frankly, I think he (and honestly, at this point, me toothey've been dating 3+ years, they've talked about their futures before, why not start a future together?) really thought she would say yes. Anyway, Logan is also at his most likable this season.

* **Chris and Lorelai get together (please hold the tomatoes)** This is actually a good thing, because it was an inevitability. Of COURSE they had to actually do the marriage thing once. They've been talking about it for YEARS. Literally since Season 1, and even before then, back when they were 16. It was an inevitability that they would eventually marry, and of course break up. It had to be done. They had to try. Lorelai had to prove to herself that Luke was the one for her, and Chris had to realize that he would never fully ""have"" Lorelai. I know a lot of people didn't like this plot, but truthfully, it had to play out at one point or another. And really, David was given a shitty hand at the end of Season 6, which infamously ends with Chris and Lorelai sleeping together. I felt the progression in their relationship was natural and smooth, considering the devolution of Luke's character in the previous season and the inevitable separation from Lorelai.

* **And oh yeah, what about Luke?** While Luke got totally Dean'd (see: dumbed down/intentionally made horrible to make room for a new plot or character), Season 7 is also redemption for HIS character. He spends more time with his new daughter, he comes to understand his own flaws, and stops being a big dumb idiot and starts fighting for Lorelai again once her and Chris break up. The Luke we know and love comes back, and weird zombie Luke who can only think about one thing at a time is gone. 

* **Rory chooses work over love.** That's really it. I was impressed with Rory's mature decision to see where her life would take her before settling down, and as an independent woman myself I thought the message was very strong and relatable. I loved that Rory wasn't going to settle down right after college because she had goals and wanted to fulfill them. I loved EVERYTHING about that. You go, Rory. 

* **And, Rory doesn't have everything figured out.** While rewatching Season 6 &amp; 7 in college, I always found the plotlines where Rory wasn't sure about her future, where she stumbled, where she put all her eggs in one basket and was rejected, where she made poor choices, and ultimately, where she was offered a job based on who she knew and some side work she had been doing for the online magazine to be VERY realistic. It was relatable, it was fun to watch Miss I Know What I'm Doing and I'm So Smart While Doing It to have the rug pulled from under her and made uncomfortable. I also liked this AYITL but WE WILL GET TO THAT.

* **Emily gets arrested.** This plotpoint is hilarious, Kelly Bishop is queen, I only regret we didn't get to see the picture of her with the guards that Lorelai took. This was great.

* **Town Shenanigans** Yeah, there are a few recycled plots here (pickles vs. rotten eggs) BUT we still get that crazy wacky town that we love. Kirk driving his car through Luke's diner, causing Luke to assess the chaos in his life and realize he needs Lorelai was fantastic. The haybale maze? I lowkey LOVE that episode, and all the imagery they play with in that episode (specifically, Rory and Logan taking hands and choosing a way together, and Lorelai and Luke walking away from each other but him SHOWING HER THE WAY before they separated...it's great). It's a good time. I can never get enough of the townies.

* **Rory finally makes friends.** I mean, it had to be said. Rory had no friends, and at one point David S. Rosenthal was like ""shit her graduation is gonna be depressing if we don't bring in people."" They brought in Lucy and Olivia who were fun, bubbly, and acted as ideal side-characters for Rory's plots. I really enjoy seeing them on screen together.

* **Paris** She was one of the characters I felt was done RIGHT. From callbacks to when the newsroom overruled her and kicked her out to her subplot of her end-of-college-career-to-do-list felt very in-character and of course, perfectly executed by Liza Weil. I thought it was appropriate she got into every grad school she applied for, and more than that, thought the way they played it (starting with excitement and ending with devastation in a very Paris-like fashion) was flawlessly done. Say what you will about some characters becoming more annoying (Lorelai), Paris had some of her best scenes in Season 7.

* **Mia's Wedding and Closure.** I loved the wrapping up of Mia and Emily here, where they admire Lorelai together, have a nice conversation. Yeah, Emiliy was in a bad mood most of the wedding, but to have them find peace with one another was a tie-up I didn't know I needed, and I was happy to see it. And also, awwww to them watching Pursuit of Happyness in the motel room and Emily liking Will Smith. That is sweet.

* **Luke and Lorelai gradually repairing their relationship.** Everything was done at JUST the right pace. Nothing rushed, nothing too demanding. There's hesitation on both sides, and there is AWKWARDNESS and I LOVE that. It's realistic! Them not knowing where they stand with one another and breaking the ice finally when they start acting like their true selves while car shopping, when Luke gets grumpy and Lorelai is called out on being too picky. From there, there are still some hiccups and misunderstandings, but ultimately, it was a realistic and well-paced way of getting them back together. And the KARAOKEEE SCEEEEN??? 'nuff said.

* **April leaves.** GUYS. Rosenthal WRITES OUT APRIL. SHE IS GOOOOOOOOOOOOONE. WHY DOES THIS GUY NOT HAVE A SHRINE DEDICATED TO HIM????

* **Luke and Lorelai finally get together.** And they finally seem to be TOGETHER-TOGETHER, having both completed their arcs of living out fatherhood and trying to be with Rory's father and realizing it was never meant to happen. 

* **The finale was perfect.** YOU GUYS. The FINALE was PERFECT. Everyone in the town was there to see Rory off, even Emily and Richard. In the chaos and the oncoming storm, Luke spends ALL NIGHT making a tent to keep the rain out and keep the party on. Rory gets to say her proper goodbye and more importantly, we as an AUDIENCE get to have a proper goodbye with everyone and the girls. It's established Lorelai will continue to go to Friday night dinners, which elates the Gilmores. Rory is on her way to the real world. The last stop is Luke's, which is exactly where the show all started. It was an INCREDIBLY well-done finale, and I absolutely applaud Rosenthal for his attempt at wrapping up the season and show. Seriously. I cry every time.

So, maybe there are a lot of people who don't agree with me, and maybe Season 7 really is poo-poo, and yes, there are a lot of issues with the writing and pacing etc. But it was never going to be the same without Amy, and I feel that a real attempt and a DECENT attempt was made at filling in the gaps without her. 

What do you guys think? What were your favorite parts of Season 7? (Please don't say when it was over)

This got long. Thanks for the read! ",19,55,False,self,,,,,
2,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2018-6-1,2018,6,1,10,8no23z,self.GilmoreGirls,What's your favorite feel-good episode?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/8no23z/whats_your_favorite_feelgood_episode/,snailslimeandbeespit,1527817605,"As the subject says, what's your favorite go-to feel-good episode of GG? It's not necessarily your overall favorite, but the one you put on when you just want some fluff to cheer you up and brighten you day. The one that's guaranteed to put a smile on your face and doesn't make you want to throw something at your TV set. 

I imagine mine is largely dependent on mood and that there are several feel-good episodes for me, but right now, my favorite feel-good episode is ""Love &amp; War &amp; Snow"" (season 1, episode 8).  I honestly think a huge part of this is that the score in this episode is so cheerful, especially the instrumental la-la-la's--you can glean a sense of what I'm talking about at the opening of this scene, but the entire episode is punctuated with these cheerful strains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nswL-OLvGzA. I could listen to the score of this episode all day! It puts me in such a good mood. 

In terms of the storyline, there's no huge drama in this episode, which also contributes to its feel-good quality. This is the episode where we learn how magical the snow is for Lorelai, and almost the whole episode has that magical feeling. Her excitement practically leaps off the screen. The main storyline is that a huge snowstorm traps Rory in Hartford and prevents Lorelai from attending FND. Rory spends most of the episode with Emily and Richard, where she introduces them to the joys of frozen pizza with freshly grated parmesan. Rory also finds old photos of Lorelai as a baby and Lorelai and Chris. Meanwhile, Lorelai wanders around Stars Hollow, giddy with delight as she marvels at the first snowfall of the year. First she runs into grumpy Luke, who does not share her love for the snow, and then she bumps into Max, who's stranded in Stars Hollow, and they proceed to have a ""World Series-level"" first date. The kind of date that makes you swoon even if you're not much of a Max fan. 

The B-storyline is that Lane is jealous of Rory and Dean spending so much time together and becomes fixated with Rich Blumenfeld's thick tresses and ends up impulsively running her fingers through his hair, which causes her to bolt to Rory and Lorelai's house to seek refuge, thus throwing a wrench in Lorelai's invitation for Max to stay over. Nothing huge happens here, and Rory and Lane quickly make up. 

Scenes I adore in this episode: Lorelai playing Max's message over and over again; Lorelai's monologue to Rory about all of the good things that have happened to her when it's bene snowing; Lorelai's conversation with Luke where she lectures him on traditions; Luke looking on from afar as Lorelai and Max kiss, one of the first real glimpses we see that he has romantic feelings for Lorelai hidden deep down as he doesn't look thrilled about the kiss; Luke overcoming his grumpiness and bringing hot beverages to the war reenacters; Sookie's song about ""love and the Dean and the cookies and the love""; and the frozen pizza scene referenced above. I've also mentioned it before on this sub, but I actually like that Lorelai invites Lane to stay over--Lorelai gets a lot of flack on this sub for being selfish, but this is one example of where she's anything but. It's clear that she wants nothing more to give in to her libido and bring Max upstairs and end her date with a home run, but she puts that desire aside because of Lane's ""major Judy Blume moment."" 

If the entire series were filled with these kinds of episodes, it would probably get boring after a while, but I appreciate having this kind of episode every now and again that leaves me with an overall good feeling. 

So that's mine. What's yours? ",31,23,False,self,,,,,

But is it truly unrealistic? I don't think so. I think one major off screen factor is often overlooked. If Gran set up a trust fund for Rory it's reasonable to assume she did so for Lorelei as well. Since Gran sets them up so that they are to be received at age 25 it's possible that after working and living at the inn until she was 24 (based on concertous interruptus when sookie says 8 years ago they moved into the house) she would have saved enough money for the down payment and with her steady income plus savings she could reasonably  afford a years worth of payments if she was careful with her budget. Then at 25 when her trust fund kicked in she could have used that to pay off the remainder of the mortgage and pay for any improvements she needed and/or wanted for it as well.,30,31,False,self,,,,,

I'm pregnant.""  Knowing this has really altered my rewatches.  Has anyone else been trying to figure out how each season would have been altered to get to this ending in case of cancellation?  Given that ASP has said she wanted Rory's first time to be with Dean when they weren't together, and how messy Rory's love life was \(especially in the revival\), I doubt she wanted Rory in a stable relationship when she found out.  I think the plan was always to have Rory facing the pregnancy alone, to really underscore that she'd be repeating Lorelai's life.

Does anyone have any ideas which boy would have been the daddy of each season, and which circumstances would have brought them together/ kept them apart?

My theories are:

1. Dean. Rory and Dean's first time could be right before the ""I love you break up"" or as part of their reconciling.  They break up again when he learns she kissed Tristan.  In theory, she could have had a more serious fling with Tristan, but I just don't see it.

2. Dean.  Similar.  They're together, but break up when he learns she visited Jess in New York. \(Possibly she kisses Jess there instead of at Sookie's wedding\).  Again, in theory she could have gone farther with Jess, but I don't see that either.

3. I can actually see 3 different endings.

A. Dean and Rory have a one\-time encounter after things blow up with Jess, but he's still with Lindsay.

B. Jess and Rory go all the way, but he still chases his father to California \(either before she tells him or because\), adding a painful layer to the concept of ""full circle"" as they both repeat their parents' lives.

C. No one.  Shows with a third season always get a fourth, so there may never have been any end of series contingency plan for the third season.

4. Dean.  Similar to the actual fourth season, but Dean and Rory's affair would've been pushed up a few episodes, so her pregnancy would've been the final revelation.  And... even though I don't think it's key that Jess is there... who knows what monkey wrench he could've thrown in things.  Maybe his presence would've made Dean rethink leaving Lindsay for Rory.  Or maybe Rory would've felt differently about him after her affair with Dean.

5. Logan.  At this point, I can't really see her having one more fling with Dean \(though anything's possible\).  I think from here on out, Logan's the guy.   
 The most obvious cause for separation would be his family's disapproval \- maybe he gives in, or maybe they ship him overseas a year early, education be damned.  But I could also see ASP pulling a gut punch by having one of his casual girls from before be pregnant first \+ having his family's approval.  \*Hopefully the Yacht\-Heist would've been cut in this scenario?  Alone, pregnant, and facing felony charges just seems like too much, and I love Rory.\*

6. Logan.  Being shipped to London is the obvious separation, but the bridesmaids and Jess were both potential sources of drama, that could have been moved or embellished depending on the needs of the plot.  I don't really see her having a full fling with Jess at this point, but... as above, anything's possible if the actors can sell it, and they can definitely sell a lot.

All in all, I don't hate the idea of the series ending with Rory pregnant.  Lorelai put so much weight on keeping Rory from following in her footsteps \- while simultaneously insisting she didn't throw away her life \- that I can appreciate the irony.

What bothers me is the idea that major traits and character arcs could have been derailed to achieve this plot.

ASP made a huge deal out of Rory not being ready to have sex for the first four seasons.  She would've kept her a virgin longer if the network had let her \(maybe she originally conceived of the pregnancy being tied to Rory's ""first time.""\)

Given that Rory not being ready to have sex was such a big part of her early characterization, it's weird to think she would've just gone ahead and done it in season one or two or three if the plot had needed it.

Maybe I'm over\-thinking it, but I'm curious what everyone else's speculations are?",23,19,False,self,,,,,

She would have loved to have Lane do more with her music.  She thinks that if Adam Brody who played Dave hadn't gone onto the OC, the show would have invested more time in Dave and Lane and Lane's marriage to Zack might not have happened.

She said that Jess and Rory share a lot of the same passions, interests, and being able to talk about books among other things and that the problem with them is Jess's inability to open up and his arrogance but that he truly cares about Rory.  She finds Rory's relationship with  Dean and Rory's relationship with  Logan to be too messy.  Her favorite scene with Emily who plays her mom is the scene where Mrs Kim and Lane share a drink together. She also loved the scene where Mrs. Kim kicks Lane out.

Disclaimer: early Dean (season 1 only) was my favorite boyfriend for Rory, and I like the character. And I'll admit that sometimes nuances of dialogue will go over my head, but every time Dean and Rory have broken up has been super obvious.

The first time Rory and Dean break up, it's on their 3 month anniversary and it's because Rory couldn't tell Dean she loved him (""Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers"" 1.16). In the next episode, ""The Break-up, Part 2"" (1.17), Rory confirms to Tristan that Dean broke up with her, because ""he didn't want to be her boyfriend anymore,"" and that he seemed sure in his decision.

The second time they break-up, is in season 3. This time, Dean publicly dumps Rory at the dance marathon, because Rory obviously likes Jess (""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"" 3.7). But later on in the season, Dean tells Rory that he's getting married to Lindsay and says something that doesn't make sense: ""When you dumped me for that jerk, I thought I'd never be happy again,"" (""Say Goodnight, Gracie"" 3.20). Now, I don't know about anyone else, but yelling at someone and dumping them in public doesn't mean you actually got dumped instead.

With the final break-up, Dean stays true to form and breaks up with Rory in public again in front of all of the Yale alumni/L&amp;D Brigade boys (""The Party's Over"" 5.8). Then later on, he postures to Luke and says that both Lorelai and Rory are too good for Stars Hollow (""To Live and Let Diorama"" 5.18). Dean acts super hurt, even though he was the one who broke up with Rory.

And I don't remember which episode this was in, but I think it was season 3 (but it could be 4), but basically Lorelai tells Rory she can't be jealous (either over Lindsay or just generally missing Dean) because she was the one who broke up with Dean.

What's going on? Was there some hidden episode where Rory viciously broke up with Dean and humiliated him in public (like he's done to her twice) that I never watched?

There's an episode in early season 6 where Rory is talking to the maid, Esperanza, in Spanish. They get on really well, and Rory ends up helping Esperanza in the kichen until Emily comes in and snaps at them. Later in the episode, Esperanza is very explicitly replaced. 

I've been watching GG since I was about 8 years old, and I always liking Emily difficult. Even when I was little, I could tell that she, at least sometimes, had good intentions, but this scene has always stood out to me as remarkably cruel. To me, it was implied that Emily replaced Esperanza because Rory was talking with her in Spanish and helping her polish the silver. 

It's just always bothered me. It's been awhile since I've watched the show, so I'd forgotten about this scene, but seeing it again stirs up all kinds of weird feelings. As a little girl, I always identified very strongly with Alexis Bledel, and by proxy, Rory. AB and I both come from Latinx families, spoke Spanish as a first language (although I lost mine in my primary school years), and even have very similar given names. That scene with Esperanza originally aired when I was maybe 10 or 11, and the part before Emily interrupts is probably one of my favorite Rory moments. 

It also brings up a pattern of cruelty Emily has for her employees. I've always tried to like Emily \- and I actually did like her in the revival; in fact, she was the only character I really appreciated there \- but the way she treats those she sees as beneath her has always bothered me.

Later, when Lorelai, Luke (Scott Patterson) and Christopher (David Sutcliffe) discover Rory and Logan together, half-dressed, the shocking scene leads to an angry confrontation between Luke and Christopher. A furious Lorelai figures out that Emily invited Christopher in an attempt to break up her relationship with Luke.

It's been built up over several episodes and now all the pieces are in place for a resolution.

The scene is going pretty well Lucy is bubbly and fun like usual. Logan is pattering along. Marty is just .. letting it happen around him\- Just chilling.

Now here the writing is pretty brilliant. Two equal and opposite lines of discussion are happening.

1. The girls are sharing their creative/academic stories about going above and beyond the call of duty. Lucy showing up to an audition after a traffic accident, Rory driving to Albany to deliver a revised page of a paper.
2. Lucy dotes on Marty for how hard he has worked while going to school. He's working 3 jobs (4 seasonally) and having a full class load.

This is really clever and very deep subtext. Everyone's being congratulated for ""hard work"" but for Marty this is pretty insulting. He works because he has to. He's hustling to eat and have a girlfriend. This is partly his central conflict with Logan from the previous seasons. He was embarrassed Rory had to pay for his meal when he was short. He had to work at Logan's parties. It makes him feel subjugated, less\-than Logan. And here the writers are grinding Marty perfectly. He's a senior, he's almost finished working like this. But one more time he has to sit across from Logan living broke. Then he drops his first and only verbal jab after Logan says, ""That's alot of jobs, my boy.""\- a pretty obvious slight. Marty finally fires back, ""Hey, just waiting for that trust fund to kick in.""

This isn't brilliant for him to say, but it clearly puts everyone in a camp. Rory moved out of Logan's apartment because of their differences with ideas about entitlement and privilege. Further, if Logan is self\-aware, he should be able to clearly recognize that, (maybe not marty himself) but a guy like Marty, is his threat, a hustler, a self\-made man. If Logan lost Rory to such a guy, Logan would have little, if any, tools to get her back. He can't change his birthright. He is a Huntzberger, it's woven into everything he does. This is a callback to the theme of the entire series itself, and why the Logan/Rory thing feels wrong and always has. Lorelai's story is about casting off the shackles of her privilege to live authentically. Logan is her antithesis. He is a slave to his upbringing, the only thing constant for him is his trajectory as a Huntzberger. All his rebellions are inauthentic; he will be what he must be. He is Lorelai's polar opposite. Or worse, he moonlights as Lorelai.

This is really really really goood.

And then ... I mean the writers just .. left Lucy out in the cold.

Let's be 100&amp;#37; clear.. Lucy .. is .. kinda awesome. Shes blisteringly witty. Emotionally intelligent, bold, she floats around making real connections with people and lives life. Rory believes it when Lucy gives her and honest critique on her article. Rory, who waffles constantly on what must be done and where her life is headed, looks to Lucy for confidence. Because Lucy... is a boss... A strong independent artsy hipster who's mad about cool\-girl speak. that's pretty much all Lucy is.

Until Logan says, ""oh, they've met.""

Then the Mistress of Ceremonies\- Lucy can't put two words together other than about 7 different versions of ""Wait what?""

Where's her drama? Where's her backbone? Further, if she, ""doesn't understand"" like she keeps on saying then how does she understand the full depth of Marty's betrayal... I mean we're not even 100&amp;#37; clear on it. Rory could be wrong about Marty here.

But not Lucy, she went form, MC to, ""You guys are hiding it from me!?"" on an hyper\-unrealistic dime considering the benign revelation, and lets be real clear here\- There has been no moral setup that would suggest Lucy would even care if Marty did ""like"" Rory. She's only been shown up to this point to have questionable if any moral leanings at all. She stated she misses breaking the law when she was finally drinking legally.

Nor has Lucy been established to be head over heels for Marty. She's known Rory for months and she doesn't even use Marty's NAME. She just calls him boyfriend. So, even if she gave a crap (something that hasn't been demonstrated) .. all that's been revealed is that Rory and Marty were close friends once upon a time. 

The missed opportunity here is that the weak link at the table .. the only one going through emotions that should make him/her crack .. is Marty.

**Say Something** - Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is frantic after the disastrous scene at wedding, and begs Luke (Scott Patterson) not to give up on their relationship. However, Luke's decision that he needs time alone leaves Lorelai devastated. Stranded at Yale without her car, Rory (Alexis Bledel) is so worried about Lorelai's depressed state that she borrows Logan's (Matt Czuchry) limo and driver and heads home to Stars Hollow to care for her mom. Meanwhile, Taylor (Michael Winters) has the whole town talking sides on the Lorelai/Luke relationship.

Specifically how Liz kicked TJ out and then lied to Luke and said he left her?  I know this fandom is a bit divided on Liz (worst mother ever or flake with a heart of gold? YMMV).  Usually, I kind of see both sides.  Liz definitely screwed up a lot (Jess had a shitty childhood, and that is a hill I will fight to the death on).  But she also got dealt a pretty crappy hand.  Being a single, teen mom with substance abuse issues is not easy, and she obviously didn't plan on doing it alone.  I think there's a lot of valid ways to read the character, but on the whole, I'd rather believe her screw ups are due to genuinely terrible judgment and that she really cares about Luke and Jess.

This episode has me second\-guessing that.

Her actual break up with TJ aside, telling Luke TJ left her because he couldn't handle being a father is... troubling.  It throws some serious doubt on her whole backstory.  Luke believes Liz has frustratingly terrible judgment and keeps picking losers who leave her high and dry, sometimes cleaning out her bank account or apartment in the process.  I think most of us just accepted that was more or less true.  But who's to say she didn't just tell him that to get his sympathy &amp; support? (Especially financial support).

Sure, some parts are true.  We know Jimmy ""The Scumbucket"" Mariano really did ditch her because he didn't want to be a father (because he casually and remorselessly says so to the kid he abandoned while making him beg for a place to crash).  But I really can't shake the idea that she was making up sob stories to take advantage of Luke.

I don't really have a clear idea or theory here.  I'm just wondering if anyone else felt the same way or had any thoughts on the subject.",12,23,False,self,,,,,

**So... Good Talk** - Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) return from their second honeymoon and Rory (Alexis Bledel) attends the customary Friday night dinner, but an angry Lorelai (Lauren Graham) refuses to see or speak to Emily. Rory surprises everyone with a rare outburst at her grandmother for interfering in Lorelai's love life. Miserable without Lorelai, Luke's (Scott Patterson) dark mood causes him to burn the food and throw any customers who complain out the door of the diner. Emily pays an unexpected visit to the diner to talk to Luke. Meanwhile, Lane (Keiko Agena) is horrified when she realizes that her mother has more influence over her than she thought.

3) Emily was unreasonably critical of Lorelai down to her style, actions, and personality.
4) She was expected to grow to be a perfect society wife (which she did not want).

Until Logan. 

What the fuck is she doing!! That cheating that Logan did was based on a misunderstanding and Rory KNOWS he didnt do it out of malice or revenge, he was lonely and sad and trying to win her back! Despite all of this, its completely understandable to be upset. But to lie and say youve forgiven him when you havent? The way she treated Logan was actually disgusting and I hated it. The paper, the coldness, the humiliation in front of friends, everything! She acted like such a bitch to him which was completely unfair. If she didnt forgive him, fine! But dont lead him on and make him happy only to shit on him again. I seriously thought this was such a bad trait of Rorys.

You thought that was bad? Hah! No, see, Rory thought it was a good idea to visit her ex-boyfriend, who still likes her, whilst her current boyfriend is out of town. She does this alone. She stays in his stupid store for a long time until theyre alone and she kisses him, cheating on Logan. Jesus! 

It doesnt matter whether or not you believe what Logan did was considered cheating, but forgiveness is forgiveness! If shes forgiven Logan (which she hasnt), then kissing Jess is cheating. Ugh, I couldnt stand her this episode. 

And lets not forget previous relationships like Dean. Treating him like crap when he did everything for her, holding onto him and hurting him by using him as jealousy bait when really she liked Jess, sleeping with Dean when she knew he was married! (Although I do blame him slightly more for that).

Meanwhile, now that Lorelai and Luke are happily reunited, Emily can't understand why Lorelai still refuses to show up at Friday night dinner. Emily's second visit to the diner to speak to Luke leads to a bitter mother/daughter confrontation. Finally, Michel (Yanic Truesdale) appears on ""The Price is Right"" and wins a motor home.

On the one hand, I think the overall concept is overwhelmingly progressive. A single mom who works hard and instills values like independence in her daughter is a beautiful thing to see portrayed on television. Lorelai decides not to get married at 16. There are dozens of badass female business owners in Stars Hollow. The list of ways that women are positively and realistically portrayed goes on and on. 

On the other hand, I can't help but be bothered with how the Gilmore Girls react when they feel threatened by other women. Lorelai is obviously threatened when she meets Sherry and makes comments like ""the whole world will line up to see that woman fat"" when she gets pregnant. Rory says that Shane would be fascinated with the process of water turning into ice - and this is obviously because she's threatened; Rory is perfectly kind to Madeline who is not the sharpest tool in the shed.  When Lorelai is confronted by a group of Stars Hollow high moms, she makes a jab that they all go to the same hairdresser. Lorelai seems to look down on her mother's way of life and the other society ladies just because that's not what she wants for her own life. I don't recall either of the girls making comments directly to Lindsay about her choices, but from the way they felt about ""The Donna Reed Show"", I'm sure they made judgments. 

Aside from that, there are some female characters that only appear once that are portrayed horribly. Like the girl Rory meets at the debutante ball, that is convinced she'll marry one of her escorts. Or the woman on the Chilton booster club who can't remember the name of her stepdaughter. The twins sisters who get married at the inn in the first season. I'm sure the list goes on. I understand that these characters exist for comedic effect - and that there are equally unrealistic male characters - but something about the prevalence of these one dimensional female stereotypes makes me a little uncomfortable. At least when a male character is made fun of, it's because he's controlling and irritating (Taylor), snarky (Michel), or downright weird (Kirk). The jokes about men are rarely about appearance or intelligence. 

Emily's maids are constantly portrayed as unintelligent and incompetent. The Puffs at Chilton apparently have the same conversation about homecoming everyday. 

Overall, I think the show does a great job of writing the main female characters as three-dimensional and realistic, but minor female characters become stereotypes. I don't think the show treats male characters this way. 

Then there's other issues, like the pregnant female characters seemingly having no other choice besides raising the child. I know that's been discussed at length on this sub. 

What do you guys think? I love the show regardless and I don't believe that every character in every show has to be portrayed realistically; I do think that a show about three extremely strong, independent women should have taken better care not to degrade other less important women.

He also says Luke makes it so that when people fail him, he gets to feel like the martyr and they get to feel like not only did they screw up but they also disappointed him.  He tells Luke to focus on his own life and leave everyone else.  He says this right before he says one of my favorite Jess lines, ""shake him real hard and maybe he'll disappear,"" about TJ.  When Luke tells Lorelai what Jess said to him, Lorelai says that Jess is unhappy, angry, and doesn't mean the things he says.  Cue to the next scene, where Lorelai rips into Jess, tells him she wants to kill him, tells him not to act stupid, that Luke has done nothing to support him and try to help him.  She tells Jess it was incredibly insensitive and mean spirited and asked him if he has any sensitivity or is he so mad at the world that he doesn't care who he hurts.  I am curious, what does everyone think about what Jess said?  I agree with the part that Luke wants to help people.  That is one his best qualities.  He genuinely would do anything for the people he cares about and sometimes even for people he just tolerates like Kirk.  I don't agree with him stealing Jess's car and hiding it but I understand why Luke did it.  He wanted Jess to go to school. I was also surprised that Lorelai defended Jess to Luke by saying that Jess was a hurt and angry kid who said things he didn't mean.  Where was that understanding when Jess first arrived in Stars Hollow.

I personally don't think Lorelai was a bad mother, let alone one of TV's worst. I do agree that her need to be the 'cool mom' was a bit much. While it did have much to do with her age, I think it was mostly due to her own childhood; she almost made the conscious decision to parent Rory in the exact opposite way that she was parented. Perhaps I'm exaggerating about this point, but I especially noticed it ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"" when Emily agrees that Rory shouldn't be friends with Jess if Lorelai doesn't approve, and Lorelai freaks out upon realizing that she's kind of like her mother.

While I think that some points were a bit embellished [in the article], I thoroughly agree with the argument about Max. I found it pretty unfair of Lorelai to refuse to discuss her breakup with Rory. Breakups are obviously difficult events, and this one was especially significant for Lorelai since she was engaged. However, Lorelai did want to know everything about Rory's love life and maintain the idea of being best friends with her daughter, so it seemed a little hypocritical for Lorelai to claim that she's allowed to keep things from Rory because she's her mother.

**To Live and Let Diorama** - When Stars Hollow's oldest resident dies and leaves his house to the town, Luke (Scott Patterson) has an ulterior motive for volunteering to help turn the house into a temporary museum. Dean (Jared Padalecki) is also working on the project, and offers Luke some unwelcome advice about the dangers of dating a Gilmore girl. To get publicity for the Dragonfly Inn, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) does an interview with a travel magazine, but immediately regrets the unkind comments she makes about being raised by Emily (Kelly Bishop, who does not appear in the episode). Meanwhile, Lane (Keiko Agena) suspects that Zack (Todd Lowe) is having a fling with music store owner Sophie (guest star Carole King), while Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Paris (Liza Weil) are both devastated by trouble with their respective flings.

**How Many Kropogs to Cape Cod?** - Wanting to make a good impression on Logan's (Matt Czuchry) powerful father, Mitchum Huntzberger (guest star Gregg Henry), Rory (Alexis Bledel) learns everything she can about him before starting work as an intern at one of his newspapers. When Lorelai (Lauren Graham) learns that Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Herrmann) have invited Logan to Friday night dinner, she ends her boycott of family gatherings in order to get to know Logan better. During the evening, Emily and Richard fawn over Logan, but Lorelai sees a side of him that causes her to worry about Rory's involvement with the Huntzberger family. Meanwhile, Lorelai gets an interesting job offer, and Luke (Scott Patterson) tries to talk Taylor (Michael Winters) into closing the Stars Hollow museum.

In ""The Haunted Leg"", Rory runs into Jess for the first time since their kiss.  She admits she was surprised to see Jess with someone else because of what happened.  Here's Jess's reply:

&gt;JESS: I'm sorry, did I hear from you at all this summer? Did I just happen to miss the thousands of phone calls you made to me, or did the postman happen to lose all those letters you wrote to me? You kiss me, you tell me not to say anything. . .very flattering, by the way. You go off to Washington. . . then nothing. Then you come back here all put out because I didn't just sit around and wait for you like Dean would've done? And yeah, what about Dean? Are you still with him? 'Cause last time I checked, you were, and I haven't heard anything to the contrary.

What's interesting to me is that content-wise, this is actually pretty similar to her final goodbye monologue to him.  Despite their differences in tone (hers is much more understanding), both speeches ultimately boil down to ""You could've talked to me.  You didn't.  What, did you expect me to wait for you? I won't.""

The parallels don't stop there.  After they snark jealously about Dean and Shane, Jess steers the conversation back to his main concern.  He asks again if she tried to contact him - via phone call, letter, postcard, smoke signal, or fruit basket.  She admits she didn't.  What's sad though - we know she wanted to.  Back in Washington, Rory had written ""Dear Jess"" on a blank piece of paper.  Rory wanting to write to Jess, but not actually sending anything reminds me of Jess calling Rory without actually saying anything.  They both want to reach out to each other, but don't know what to say.

Pair that with their words and their arcs are basically them switching places.  Rory moves from being unable to talk to Jess to hurt that Jess didn't talk to her.  She moves from being hurt that Jess didn't wait for her, to being unwilling to wait for him.  Jess moves in the opposite direction.

**Blame Booze and Melville** - Rory (Alexis Bledel) is surprised by the performance review she receives from Logan's (Matt Czuchry) father, Mitchum Huntzberger (guest star Gregg Henry), at the newspaper. Luke's (Scott Patterson) plan to buy the Twickham house is threatened when Kirk (Sean Gunn) makes a competing bid. Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is thrilled when the travel magazine featuring The Dragonfly Inn hits the stands, but worries about Emily's (Kelly Bishop) reaction to the article. Meanwhile, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) goes into labor and Emily becomes a personal patron for a ballet dancer.

I know there are people who will argue that grand gestures are inherently negative, but I don't know that I agree with that. I think they can be a great way to show that you care and are willing to sacrifice/change.... but they have to be followed by that change for me to enjoy them and they can't be used with the sole purpose of ending an argument.  I was wondering about other's thoughts on the prevalence of gestures as a whole, including ones I missed or didn't list below!   


I think the first grand gesture I remember is Max proposing to Lorelai. I HATE the 1000 yellow daisies bullshit and I think Lorelai was on track with her original rejection when Max brought up the idea. (I also never really got how being proposed to over the phone was romantic, buuuut what do I know) He used what Lorelai had said to manipulate her into the answer he wanted while not considering the real problems they had that Lorelai addressed in her original rejection. I don't think he did it maliciously or even intentionally, but it's irritating all the same.   


Another example we see is Luke (who has many grand gestures) making Lorelai a chuppah. I have mixed feelings about this one. I think it's a gesture of good will, but he continues to exhibit jealousy and aggressive behaviors when Lorelai dates other men. For that reason, it comes across flat to me. When he builds Lorelai the ice rink, though, I see a very genuine apology for his grumpy behavior affecting Lorelai and he continues to try to reign in his shitty behavior over the course of their relationship (until everything goes to shit.)   


Jess showing up with Distiller tickets will never fail to piss me the hell off and him barging into SH to tell Rory her loves her, then showing up at her dorm makes my blood boil every time. To me, this is a great example of emotional manipulation and a sense that because he's doing those things, he deserves forgiveness and Rory should just be fine with everything that happened, despite the fact that he follows these up with no real change.   


Logan's string of grand gestures in S6 (the flowers, 'fancy fruit,' coffee cart) left me luke-warm until he went to Lorelai. Once he went to the Dragon Fly, I was moved and felt like he was genuinely attempting to show Rory he cared and get a second chance, not win blanket forgiveness by giving her things. He continues to come through for Rory afterward in a way that makes me think he was very serious about being better for her. In season 7, he flies to Mia's wedding after behaving inappropriately, and I am always super proud of Rory for telling him to grow up because whisking her away isn't going to work.

Watching them make mistakes and wrestle with the consequences is part of what makes the show so compelling.  However, sometimes they do really terrible things that are clearly not intended to be terrible by the narrative.  Or things are framed in such a way, that it has unfortunate implications.

If you had the opportunity to rewrite an accidentally problematic storyline into something wholesome - what would you change and how would you change it?  Assume you still have to follow the basic parameters of network TV and work with more or less the same limitations the original writers did.

I'd fix Sookie's third pregnancy.  I just hate that Jackson lied about his vasectomy and that Sookie was framed as haplessly stuck with an unwanted pregnancy.

First, I'd have Jackson come to Lorelai with his suspicion that Sookie's pregnant - which, because of his vasectomy, is impossible unless she's had an affair.  Lorelai doesn't believe Sookie would do this, 

but the evidence is there - she seems pregnant.  She approaches Sookie, who realizes Lorelai's right - ""Holy Crap, I'm pregnant.""  Sookie reaffirms that of course she would never cheat on Jackson.  She doesn't know how this is possible... unless Jackson lied to her about his vasectomy.  Upset and horrified (because in real life, that's rape, actually), Sookie goes to confront him, they have a big fight. They end up going to the vasectomy doctor so Jackson can ""prove"" he did it, since he wouldn't want her to just take his word for it.  The Doctor confirms that s/he gave Jackson a vasectomy, and insists on checking Jackson out.  It turns out his vasectomy reversed itself (a rare, but well-documented phenomenon)!  They're both over the moon.  Sookie didn't cheat! Jackson didn't lie!  They each knew the other would never do that!  Also, Jackson is proud that his ability to propagate is nigh unstoppable.  Sookie finally lets it sink in - they're having another baby.  She's thrilled!  Now that she's not fresh from the trauma of childbirth, she'd actually been regretting giving up on her original plan of three.  Now she has the opportunity to follow through with that.

Lorelai calls up Emily after her ""Wild"" attempt and tells her about when she was 13. She was rejected by a boy, and she left school and went to the mall. Her father found her there, got her a pretzel, and they went to the movies together. They watched Grease and An Unmarried Woman. (""One for you, one for me, he said."")

And like lightning, it struck me. Is this why Lorelai likes movies so much? Why she watched them with Rory all the time?   


Lorelai's relationship with her father was tumultuous at best. While their relationship had some redemptionssilently staring at each other in the hospital in Season 1, his covering for her when she crawled out the window to escape a horrible date in Season 2, his remarking that Rory's Bon Voyage party is a testament to Lorelai and the life she built in Stars Hollow in Season 7. They have few good memories together, and more bad ones overclouding the few good ones, as the revival was quick to point out. 

But this one memory that she holds onto, whether consciously or not, I believe affected her love for movies. We don't know much about Lorelai before the age of 13, just that she had high expectations put on her by her parents and that she rebelled against them. But no matter what, Lorelai has shown us again and again how much she wanted her parents' love. Whether she was yelling at Emily for not being happy that she and Max were engaged, or confronting Richard in his study after Chris' parents left and she tried to thank him for standing up for her. Or whether she's confessing to her mom that she was crushed when a boy told her she wasn't really a Gilmore.  


What if her love for movies came from this single memory with Richard? The one happy time she had with her father? Specifically, this is probably why she likes old movies. Grease and An Unmarried Woman came out in 1978. Not to mention, together they ate popcorn and candyjunk food, something she prizes highly well into adulthood, and takes pride in the fact she eats too much of.  


I believe that her love for old movies and junk food, conscious or not, is due to seeking that connection with her father that she once had on what she quotes to be, ""the best birthday ever.""  


That's all. Thanks for listening guys!

Emily: Hello? 

Lorelai:  I was 13 years old. 

Emily: Lorelai? 

Lorelai: It was my birthday. And Royston Sinclair III had broken my heart in front of everyone. I'd snuck into your closet that morning and took that green beaded top that was your mother's, that you kept so carefully wrapped up in tissue paper in your cedar closet. I was never supposed to touch it. But I stole it, and I wore it to school with my Chemin de Fer sailor jeans, and I thought no one was as stylish as I was. But Royston laughed. He said I was cheap. He said the only reason he'd been my boyfriend was because he was mad at Angie Morgan and he wasn't anymore. He called me loud and weird. **He said there was a rumor going around that I wasn't actually a Gilmore.** That I was the gardener's daughter and you'd bought me because you couldn't have children of your own. **And I was crushed.** 

And I ran out of class and I ran out of school, and I went to the mall. And I was sitting in the food court, wishing I had some money to buy a pretzel 'cause I was starving, and I looked up and there was Dad. Standing in front of me at the mall. He never came to the mall. That day, he went to the mall. And he was furious. ""Why aren't you in school?"" he asked. ""Tell me right now, Lorelai. Why aren't you in school?"" And I tried to think of something, some lie that would make sense, but I couldn't. All I could think was that yesterday I had a boyfriend who loved me and today I didn't. 

And I started to cry. I just sat there like an idiot, bawling. And finally after what seemed like forever, I managed to control myself a little bit, and I calmed down. And I waited. I waited for him to yell at me, to punish me, to ground me forever, to tell me how disappointed he was in me. And nothing came. And finally, I got up enough courage to look up at him, and he was standing there with a pretzel. A giant pretzel covered with mustard. And he handed it to me and he said, ""Let's go.""

**And he took me to the movies. We saw Grease and An Unmarried Woman. Something for me and something for him, he said. He bought me popcorn and Red Hots**, and we sat in the dark and we watched. And then he took me home, and he gave me his sweater to cover up the stolen top, and he told you that he'd picked me up from school and taken me to the club for a soda. And that was it. We never discussed it again. **It was the best birthday I ever had.** I just thought you should know.",21,131,False,self,,,,,
