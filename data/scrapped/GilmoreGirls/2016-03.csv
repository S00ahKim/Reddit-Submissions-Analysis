The sets mostly always look incredibly generic and fake and studio like. The set for NYC when Rory visits Jess is embarrassingly bad. The whole town of Stars Hollow just looks like a WB set. Yale is just as bad. I don't think they paid enough attention to production which if they did would add so much more surrealism to the show. I grew up in CT, I know how amazing it can look. 

Then there's the extras. They're so incredibly generic. For one you can see them always mouthing ""blah blah blah"", they're always just blindly and randomly walking around town like it's a GTA game. And the worst part is how any time Lorelie or Rory engages in an extra.. they NEVER have a speaking part. It's just Lorelie talking at the extra while the extra just stands there staring at her. 

I love the show, but a lot of the short comings clearly stem from production. I think a lot of times the show gets tunnel vision with the dialog and other aspects suffer for it. Most of the time you even clearly see there's never anything in the coffee or drinks they're drinking out of.

A lot of people (myself included) thought that could be indicative of a Logan/Rory endgame, but now [Jared Padalecki has confirmed that his scene is also in Fall](http://gunsjawlinesandhair.tumblr.com/post/141440456999/jareds-seacon-mg-tidbits). This was already being speculated because of a BTS video where you can see [both Jared and Milo Ventimiglia on the Fall Stars Hollow set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUCLeE5JUpk&amp;feature=youtu.be), so now I'm thinking Jess could be in the finale too. 

Since they're filming 2 episodes at a time, it's possible Milo was there to film for something other than Fall, but the fact that Jared was on the same set on the same day makes me think there's a good chance they were filming together or at least filming for the same episode. Having all three guys in the finale would actually sort of make sense to me? None of them were in the original series finale, so it would be kind of nice to have them there this time around. It would also explain why the guys from the LDB have been able to lightly spoil some of what they were filming. I was really surprised they were allowed to confirm that they were in the finale since so many people thought that could potentially give away who Rory ends up with, but if Jess and Dean also make an appearance then that's still totally up in the air.

My apologies if this has been said before. 
So I've been watching Gilmore Girls on this channel called Up (some Christian channel?) and they're on season 2. In season 1, Dean is perfect.  He even took the heat when the ppl in town were saying he's the bad guy for the break up. Luke even got into a scuffle with him when he went to get coffee at his diner post breakup.  Season 2, Dean is constantly attacked from all ends.  He has to defend himself to Richard at a dinner and then again when he gifts Rory with the car.  He has to deal with Tristan trying to steal his girl during the play.  He has to deal with Jess' immature bad boy image because again, another guy is trying to take his girl. So by the end if season 2, Dean is no longer the Dean from season 1. He gets worse in later seasons.  I always felt he never fully got over Rory.  Here's the thing, the more I read about the revival the more I'm dreading she's not going to wind up with Dean. Granted it wasn't until I binged watched all 7 seasons last year that I started to be okay if Rory winds up with the Jess that finally grew up.  But I have this feeling she's going to wind up with Logan. Sorry, but that boy did not grow on me when he first came on the scene and I liked him even less when I binge watched last year.  I just think Dean had it the hardest,  the most to prove and the one that genuinely loved Rory.

I am, for the first time, watching all of Season 7 and it is truly horrid. Anyway, I just got past the episode where Logan tells Lucy at dinner that Marty introduced him to Rory. Lucy gets extremely mad, feels betrayed, and runs out.

Am I missing something because I don't really understand her reaction? Okay, they didn't tell her they knew one another but she also doesn't give them any time to explain their previous relationship. For all she knows they could have lived down the hall from one another Freshman year, said hi a few times and Logan met Rory when visiting his dorm one day.

I mean, I guess I understand being kind of weirded out that they didn't say they knew each other but Lucy's extreme reaction (and then Olivia being super mad too) and betrayal was more one of someone who had found out that her boyfriend and close friend were having an affair. She didn't even know Marty had ever liked Rory...just that they had been friends early in school.

Okay, rant over. Marty is the worst. :)",17,10,False,self,,,,,

* I think that he'll still be living with his mother, but his mother will be living in HIS house (maybe the Twickum house?). 
* Along the same lines, I hope that he has a family. A strange, awkward family that goes roller blading and does tai chi in the town square together.
* Now a big question is did he ever settle on a career? I would personally love to see him as a career adviser, as he has contacts pretty much everywhere.

I'm procrastinating a paper (Rory would be disappointed), so I've been pondering this. So my question to all of you is what other careers would be suitable for the characters of GG? Here's a few of my ideas:

* I could see Lorelai as a news anchor! Not on CNN or anything like Rory had dreamed of, but for a small town, feel good, kind of pointless news channel. She's fast-paced, personable, gorgeous, and could probably make even the most boring subjects fun.

* Lane would be a wonderful radio host for a rock show. She knows so much about the history and relationships of different bands, I could see her show being fascinating.

* I could see Rory as a great teacher. While it's a wonderful and noble occupation, I imagine it seems a bit ""below"" Rory's potential for some people. But she tutored and helped people in subjects a ton of times throughout the show. She's kind, helpful, and seems to be really good at making difficult and complex subjects more accessible. 

* I was pretty sad when Paris chose medschool, but I could totally see her being involved with medical ethics boards and being important in the politics of healthcare.
