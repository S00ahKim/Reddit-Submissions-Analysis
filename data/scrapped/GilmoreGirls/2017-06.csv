Lilly Collins, Rosie, also is a single mom who has a chance to be with the the baby daddy too. It plays out extremely well and it ends with a happy ending.

I personally would say no because although I had a crush on her when I first watched it, rewatching it again has changed my mind. This is because her negative characteristics are more noticeable and although she is pretty I don't think she is anything special in the looks department.

Lorelai is a German name which comes from a river nymph who would lure sailors to their death with the babbling noise of the waters (I think that this is a fairly well known thing within the fandom). Luke's name means ""light"". Emily's name means ""industrious and striving"" but according to wikipedia it can also mean ""rival"". Richard's name means ""powerful ruler"" and ""brave and hardy"". Chris' name means ""carrier of christ"" because St. Christopher carried Jesus across a river. So, a lot of those names make sense in relation to their characters but Luke and Christopher don't really make as much direct sense. 

Well, yesterday I was listening to music on my phone and ""Reflecting Light"" popped up. It made me think of a Tumblr post I saw in the last few weeks about how sweet that song was considering that Luke's name means light. Sam Phillips, who wrote so much music for the show, most likely wrote that song specifically for the episode. The romance quotient of the wedding dance gets jacked up a little bit more when taking that into consideration!

Well, as I was contemplating how sweet this was it occurred to me that Luke's name's root is also the same root that Lucifer comes from. Considering how much thought ASP seems to have put into the other names in the series, is strikes me as rather striking to juxtapose someone whose name is associated with Lucifer with someone whose name is associated with Christ. To top that off, Luke's penchant for fishing and boating, Lorelai's name being associated with luring fishermen to their deaths, and Chris's name being associated with being able to safely traverse a river just overloaded my mind. 

I'm wondering if all of the symbolism in the names here shows a bit of what ASP was originally intending to do with the characters and relationships. In the beginning of the series Luke appeared to be such a kind and thoughtful person but by the time ASP put him and Lorelai together, and then especially after April showed up, his character fell apart and lost a lot of his charm. On the other hand, Chris comes into the show as a horribly immature person but over the course of the series he grew up and became a more stable part of the girls' life. I'm wondering what would have happened between Lorelai/Luke/Chris if ASP hadn't been removed from the show but I don't think that it would have been very good for Luke. As a huge Luke fan, I'm kind of glad that she wasn't allowed to butcher him or, god forbid, kill him off. Any other thoughts on the matter?",22,23,False,self,,,,,

Instead of respecting her choice and being there for her daughter in a rough patch, she acts like its all about her now that Rory is abandoning the future Lorelai thought she should have. You know who acted that way? Emily! Lorelai has become her mother! The hypocrisy is outstanding. Lorelai spent her entire life going on and on about how her parents treated her bad because they wanted big things for her and how they designed her life without her input, and then goes and does the same thing to Rory?

I have been thinking about this for quite a while and I finally made an account to post this here. The following is just my personal opinion, it goes without saying. I've always loved GG but I lately I've been thinking about the writing and it occured to me: the main problem this show has(S1-S6+AYTL) is that ASP tried to mix two (in my opinion) incompatible types of shows: a Drama and a Sitcom and that's why a lot of times the writing simply doesn't work and the characters end up doing strange things. Now, I suspect what she was trying to do is something like Katims' Parenthood, a comedy/drama type show, but really she ended up using a lot of sitcom elements that were so out of place and that are the source of a lot of contradicting that happens in GG forum discussions. It damages the characters somehow. I'll give the first example that comes to mind.

In AYTL, after the funeral, Lorelai tries to delay her turn at saying something about Richard so this whole thing happens where she tries to jump over some guy, her leg gets stuck she goofs around. To me, that type of scene belongs in a sitcom. I expect to hear a laughing track or something. What happens next is an actual dramatic moment that would never be part of a sitcom and fits in the drama genre.

Another example is Kirk. He is by the end of the show a sitcom character shoved in a drama show, in my opinion. The over the top infantilising is just so out of place.

Michael's over the top rudeness and attitude sometimes feel sitcom worthy as well.

I'm blanking right now but a lot of times when I read comments here debating a certain situation where first a sitcom type thing happens and then a serious thing all I can think of is ""But that was supposed to be just a sitcom joke, it doesn't go with the character and that's why it's so weird"".

Just a thought. I still love GG but I think I finally figured out what is making it all not flow (for me). Season 7 was different and seemed darker (albeit with a happier ending than AYTL) because Rosenthal picked a style and stuck with it and didn't make the characters do goofy sitcomy stuff(to the best of my recollection).

I'd love to hear what you think too, this is just my opinion.",11,13,False,self,,,,,

Richard seemed to show more affection and interest to Rory than he did Lorelai. This was probably because they bonded over their shared interest in literature and Rory's more serious personality seemed to suit her Grandfather more.

However it seemed Emily just wanted Rory to act how she wanted Lorelai to conduct herself when she was younger. This seemed clear to me when they eventually clashed after she lived in her Grandparent's home for a while.",12,39,False,self,,,,,

I'm nearing the end of Season 6 on my first rewatch. I kind of want to start again after this. I'm so not a rewatch kind of person, but to be honest this show is helping me through a bad patch that's left me hurt and somewhat lonely. And I love it, love noticing new pop culture or musical references, and quips and bits I didn't notice before.

I'm curious how many others just feel so strongly inclined to rewatch, especially if seeing things over again isn't normally your thing?
