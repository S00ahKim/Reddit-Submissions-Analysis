The worst episodes for me are the episode where they watch Willy Wonka (and Lorelei invites Dean over) and the episode where Emily serves pudding (the number of times they say pudding in that episode is insane). Also Rory's first night at college and the rating of different take out places. 
Does anybody else get these cravings? Also, how do they not weigh a ton? I love the way they adore food and coffee as much as I do.",8,32,False,self,,,,,

Also,why can't they put weights in the coffee cups,so it at least looks like there is coffee in them?Sometimes I expect to see coffee pouring out of them.",19,18,False,self,,,,,
