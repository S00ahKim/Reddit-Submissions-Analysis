But now - I'm watching  the  show  - at 31 and.... Lorlei  just comes off so childish and petulant. The way she  flirts with Luke then  acts all wide eye surprised  when  people suggest  he  likes  her. How she  couldn't  just  be happy  for christopher when he found Sherry.

My girlfriend is a huge fan of this show. It got her through some though times an remains to this day as her cozy tv when she is feeling down.

Unfortunately, and I am ashamed to say i do not have a wiki page of knowledge about this show. My girlfriend does and any attempts at me asking sneaky questions to gain an insight in what she might like ends up with her guessing the present.

This happened just last christmas. Went out of my way to get her a signed script by some of the cast. But due to my questions she had pretty much guessed what it was. It killed me, I pride myself on my gift giving abilities and it ruined the present even though I know she loves it. I also got her a few magnets of catch phrases from the show and a mug saying lukes. The mug was her favourite in the end.

So people of /r/GilmoreGirls please help me with fantastic and goofy and lovely ideas for my girlfriend. I ask now as it gives me plenty of time to source, buy or make the perfect christmas and/or birthday present next september. Just as a side note we live in london and travelling is not an option this year due to her being in university and us recently moving. But I will save if i have to.

On a side note. I already have all the dvd's bought. But i have heard her say she would love something like a map of stars hollow.

I have avoided all boards/sites/spoilers so forgive me if this is all overly discussed. I have no one irl to share my thoughts with and I have to get it out...In random order...

1. Rory was poorly written. She is supposed to be a smart over achiever yet we never see her ""being smart."" We hear about the hours reading books, writing papers, etc yet all we see is her social life. It's really hard to believe she was so disciplined and yet so popular. I would have loved to see more conflict and struggle in her studies, not sure how, interactions with professors or maybe...or maybe have a story arc following her journalism stint at the paper (I don't count the ploy to introduce Logan). I hated how shallow she was and how her major stories involved boys/men. It killed me when she hooked up with Logan. I wanted her to pick somebody for their mind, someone interesting and complex...how she was supposed to be.

2. Luke and Lorelei was a fine story arc until the break up! It was obvious from episode one those two would hook up, fine. But when they created all this stupid drama (Luke has a daughter?!?!? DUMB) just to break them up and draw it out more. It really seemed contrived.

3. More Sookie! She was so funny and entertaining to watch yet in the last couple seasons she didn't seem as important to the show. Again, they focused mostly on Lorelai's relationship with men instead of exploring what it would really be like to run an inn with your best friend (a wacky one at that).

4. They made Dean dumb. Granted it was early on but in the very beginning he would read books Rory gave him and actually have conversations. I guess they turned him into the ""opposite"" of Rory so it was clear they weren't right for each other but I didn't like not rooting for him.

5. Rory...ok I hate to criticize because I don't know if it's the writers or just the acting...but that voice and delivery. Why did she talk like a baby? I briefly started watching episode 1 just to see how they aged and blow me down Rory's voice was different!! Her voice was lower and she almost sounded like a tom boy. Her voice at Yale..come on, nobody would take that seriously.

6. Everyone is TOO rich. I loved the first few seasons when we see Lorelei shunning the silver spoon for down to earth Stars Hollow and it's folk. By the end Rory would just take a jaunt to London, oh yes, as you do. Even Christopher became stupidly wealthy because why? It wasn't easy to relate to these characters anymore.

7. I felt bad for Digger, Kirk was never funny, they could never eat that way yet look that way, I want to live in Stars Hollow, Dave Rygalski was the best boyfriend of the whole series.....

Ok, that's all for now. I might need to add more later to vent. ",17,8,False,self,,,,,
