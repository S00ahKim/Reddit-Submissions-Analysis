Anyone want to rant like Luke?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1zqdi9/having_a_dark_day_anyone_want_to_rant_like_luke/,Rants_with_wolves,1394126075,"I love the show, but I'm in a grumpy mood and watching the Gilmore Girls. Thought I'd ask what or who you dislike about the show. As for me...
1. Colin and Finn: I've never seen two guys in more need of a punch in the nose. Every time they're on screen they are rude, overly entitled jerks.
2. Paul Anka: Granted, any critter that Lorelai is in charge of will have weird issues that she not only accommodates but encourages, but introducing Paul Anka the way they did just felt forced. 
3. Rory's interest in Logan Huntzberger: The timing was very weird to me. The first few times Rory meets Logan, he is rude to her friend and she dislikes him. Then, when she's working at the Yale newspaper and finds out he's rich and connected, she maneuvers to try and spend time with him. Up until that point she'd never shown that type of manipulative behavior before.
4. The episode where Kirk was a real estate agent (Season 6 ep. 18, The Real Paul Anka): When talking to Lorelai about the house they are in he mentions that it was the site of ""a particularly grisly murder-suicide"". Being from a small town myself, I can guarantee that if that had occurred, it would be front page news for months. Not something that Lorelai didn't know about. 
That's all for now. I'm going home, where I have a gigantic bottle of vodka at my place - the largest bottle of vodka known to man.",3,15,False,self,,,,,
