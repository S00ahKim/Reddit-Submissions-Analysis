I LOVE Lane, but even without kids, her story would have turned out remarkably similar because of her personality and the reality of her situation. 

Lane wanted to make it in the music industry so badly, but no other member of Hep Alien is actually dedicated to Hep Alien. She attached herself to a sinking ship. They have a few random small ""breaks,"" like the tour and the almost performance at CBGB's, but people act like success for the band was on the horizon when Lane got pregnant and her terrible terrible children ruined everything. That was not the case. They were no bigger at the end of season 6 than they were at the beginning of their formation. Which makes sense since the entertainment industry is so hard to break into. Not to mention, Hep Alien was terrible; they were never going anywhere ""big."" It would have been completely implausible for them to suddenly be even an underground hit. 

There also seems to be this weird idea that kids left her ""stuck"" in Stars Hallow. I don't think Lane is stuck anywhere. Her personality seems to indicate that she's not very adventurous to begin with and craves the comfort of familiarity. She's also deeply connected to her mom, no matter their struggles. I don't think she ever would have left for good. But even if she had wanted to leave, kids aren't what prevented her from doing so. It was her refusal to accept that she might not make it in the entertainment industry. She put all her eggs in one basket instead of diversifying and showing passion for other aspects of music. 

There were years between when she moved out of her mom's and when she got pregnant. She could have moved to a larger city at any time. She could have gone back to school and become a music teacher. She could have gone back to school and ran her own instrument or record store. She could have networked with Sofie to meet people. She could have worked in or opened a bar with an open mic night, all while continuing to work on her music. That would have been a better story for her, definitely, and I too hate that she is running her mom's shop, which she showed no passion for ever. But she showed no desire, drive, or passion to do these other things long before she had kids. 

I just don't see how Lane in Stars Hollow running a local business was ever not going to be how her story ended. 

ETA: I actually think having a family is a beautiful end to Lane's story and could help heal a lot of the hurt and rejection she obviously felt growing up.  She never felt accepted at home, she was constantly stressed and terrified of losing her mother's love for doing the ""wrong"" thing. She was smothered by rules and a lack of affection. It's not a ""bad"" thing that she was able to find a nice guy who loved her just as she was and wanted her to be happy and then built a life off that love. The idea that this makes her character weak is so sad to me. ",24,48,False,self,,,,,

Logan made this big deal about striking out on his own with the company in San Fran, throwing away his destiny, et cetera, told Lorelai he wanted to be like her. In the revival, suddenly hes back working for his dad. I know the Palladinos hate S7, and probably didnt intend for him to buck destiny, but they acknowledge it happened in other ways (Lorelai and Chris were married, etc)


He doesnt even need to have come running back to the family business  its not like Mitchum is ailing/elderly and needs someone to immediately take over the Huntzberger business or anything. Its possibe he failed on his own, but we never hear that. Hes very in love with Rory in season 7, wants to marry her, wants to factor her in (although that for some reason vanishes as soon as he gets the San Fran job). And yet hes following his dads orders to marry some French heiress he doesnt even like? One of Logans redeeming qualities is how hard he always fought for Rory. 

 And beyond that, his dad never even cared who he was with and even came to think Rory was a good influence on him, so why the heiress? They need *more* money? I know shes just a symbol for Logans destiny, but whats so incompatible with Rory/Logan and his destiny? Shes well-bred, well-educated and sharp, her career is floundering, shes bored and restless, and now shes going to be having his baby. 

Why wouldnt Logan just break it off with Odette and marry her? Rory and Logan both clearly want that. I know she says Vegas, but Are you really going to marry her? is pretty cut and dried. Plus Rory knows journalism, she can help him manage the empire (this would actually make sense, considering they loved writing her into managerial positions, like the DAR or the YDN or whatever, and not so much writing her as an actual boots on the ground journalist  shes clearly got more of the Emily/Lorelai manager brain than the Richard or Christopher cog in a machine brain). Or she could hang at home and write more books or whatever. 

She and Lorelai are going to come into millions of dollars when Emily dies anyway, especially after she sold that house and all the furniture, and Lorelai would want none of it, so wealth is in Rorys future either way. 
It just felt contrived to me  of course a lot of that is because this stuff would have made way more sense if it had been season 7/8 as intended and the characters therein were in their 20s and not 30s. But the stagnancy of the characters over nine years was bad and nonsensical writing. The thats the kid stuff was like nails on a chalkboard. Its obvious they never wanted Lorelai to have a kid besides Rory (I suspect thats part of the reason for April, actually, throw Luke a pity kid) so they could have found another way to write around that besides We just didnt talk about it for 9 years duh doy. Why just dust off your season 8 scripts instead of coming up with some fresh ideas?

&gt; Most TJ scenes. I actually often find him funny (Im in eska-row!) but only in small doses and usually when hes playing off Liz, who is the truly hilarious one of the two. Him with just Luke is a snoozer for me 

&gt; Madeline Albright in bed with Rory. Too weird 

&gt; A lot of stuff in the episodes where Lorelai and Rory are estranged. So much filler, and the only funny Paul Anka joke anyone ever made is when Christopher told Lorelai to check her tickets because he couldnt be playing that early.

**Take the Deviled Eggs...** - When Rory (Alexis Bledel) is invited to Sherry's (guest star Madchen Amick) baby shower, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is forced to attend as well and inadvertently learns more about Christopher's life than she wanted to know. Meanwhile, when Luke (Scott Patterson) interrogates Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) about where he got the money to buy a used car, he discovers that Jess has a surprising second job.

Rory tells Paris she will be a great editor of the Yale Daily News. But in Chilton she hated Paris as the Franklin editor, and referred to her as a ""crazy anal micro-manager.""

When Taylor wakes up everyone in the middle of the night they use the church bells, but Luke and Lorelai broke the church bells in S4.

If it's the middle of the night when Taylor appears by video link, why is his nephew awake and playing with toys?

When Rory visits Anna's shop she says she stocks one-of-a-kind things because of only-child syndrome. But April said her uncle in a lab helped her with the DNA tests. If Anna is an only child, does mean the uncle isn't a real uncle, but just a friend of the family?

When Luke goes on the disaster date with the swimming instructor, he hates the vegan food and goes home and dives into junk food because he's still hungry. That strikes me as out of character. I get that he was hungry but surely he'd have something healthy in the fridge he would have eaten?

There has always been really awkward gay jokes but I never realized how many! It's non-stop. ""Fruity"", ""gay"", ""so modern"". It's interesting because it's obviously a reflection of Amy and Dan's understanding and belief at the time. 

Women-hating language. It's UNREAL. Slut, whore, tramp. Sometimes it's joking but often the joke reflects what they really think. I know lots of posts have already talked about the fat shaming of the girls to other women. But holy crap, ""Sherry is so thin,"" as if that's a bad thing and as if Lorelai and Rory aren't thin!? Plus Lorelai's best friend is a fat woman. Like, what the hell? But seriously, if you're ever doing a OS rewatch just notice how much shit talk they do of other women. It's All. The. Time. Any sort of faceless woman, like when Digger takes the girl who doesn't wear underwear to the party. When Richard's business partner's new wife is talked about as being stupid. It's endless. Women being portrayed as worthless, stupid and whores. But it's funny because it's all in the contrast of these great, powerful women like Emily, Paris, Lorelai. Paris talking about the 17-year-olds coming for them (hilarious line) but again so, so, so women-hating. Women can't be powerful without the tearing down of other women? I call BS. It's what makes me uncomfortable with ASP and question whether or not I like her.  

I remember people praising GG for having like the most diverse background actors... As if placing non-white people in the background is progressive. Hilarious. Lane is the only one who has a story and it's, as we know, a terrible story. Michel is awesome, but totally a token, side-kick character.

Logan only becomes completely committed to Rory in season 7, when Amy isn't a writer. And in revival he is unattainable again. So, in Amy's mind: is Logan always unattainable?

I was very anti-Rory after seeing the revival, but I've had a bit of a change of heart. 

So, here's the thing. I get that people were disappointed by Rory in the revival and I was, too. But if we're treating season 6 and season 7 as canon... Rory was considered an asset by many people in the newspaper biz outside of Mitchum. The people at the Stamford Eagle Gazzette had lots of positive experiences with her. She's offered more than one job post-graduation and ends up on Obama's campaign trail. In the 9ish years between GG and the revival, it can be assumed she had a somewhat successful career given that her slump is throwing everyone for a loop. I don't think Rory was a natural born journalist, but I don't think she was a bad one, either. 

Mostly I just don't believe Mitchum knew enough about Rory at the time to make the statement that she ""didn't have it."" He's basing his opinion off of her few week performance as an intern, where she is wildly successful... as an intern. He seems to be upset at her for ""staying in her lane,"" so to speak, and not rushing to offer her opinions, but I doubt he'd ever read a single thing she'd written and I don't think it's a fair assessment based on her job position. Sure, Rory could have been more outspoken as an intern, but again, I think it goes back to her not being a natural born journalist, rather than an intrinsically bad one. Again, we see her have lots of success as a journalist specifically in s6 and s7. 

I also feel a little less irritated with Rory professionally when I think of the fact that AYITL was literally a year long. She's in this huge professional slump but on top of that, she's realizing that she's not really in love with, passionate about, or cut out for journalism anymore, which is all she's supposedly wanted since she was four.  She has these opportunities that either fall through or she just can't make work because she's no longer in the game... She's depressed, hopeless, and drifting, and while I still believe the story line would have better suited a Rory in her twenties, I also don't think it's out of the question that a woman in her thirties would have an identity crisis. She finds a new path with help from her family and friends and ends up writing a novel, and feeling content with it. And all of this happens within a year. I think the reason is feels like Rory is such an absolute failure (disregarding ASP's inability to let go of how she envisioned ending the series) is because we don't really see the upswing. We spend the whole time watching her make these awful decisions and then right when she starts to pull herself out of it, boom pregnancy credits. 

As a contrast, when she has her fall from grace in S6, we see her really hit rock bottom, then rise up and fix her mistake. It's more satisfying and palatable because we see just how much Rory has to work through emotionally to come out on top. In AYITL, which we've waited for for NINE YEARS, you only see her (out of character) mess of a life with none of the can-do spirit Rory tends to face challenges with. I also think everyone is allowed to have a bad time... sure, Rory was pretty obnoxious.. but again, the whole series takes place over the course of one year. It's not like it's a true four season arc; it just feels like one. And if we had been able to see Rory handling her pregnancy, I think it would have restored a lot of people's faith in her. I imagine that being the exact wake up call she needed to refocus herself. 

Anyway... I ended up not hating Rory the more time I've had to think about the story. I still believe ASP fucked it up and did Rory (and Alexis) a disservice, but when I try to view the story through the lense of canonical, OS Rory, rather than ASP's shit storm revival version of all the characters, I can understand and make peace with her story.

I mean, how entitled do you need to be to do something like that? Moreover, if you were to do anything like that at the Universities I have attened you would have some consequence.

But it's fairly established that Lorelai's birthday was sometime in the spring (assuming the 3rd season ""Happy Birthday Baby"" was timed accordingly in April or roughly thereabout, when Lorelai turns 35). Considering that Rory turned 16 in the fall of season 1 (October 8, the invitation said), she would turn 19 roughly 6 months after Lorelai turns 35, which would mean Lorelai got pregnant when she was 15. 

It's even worse at the beginning of Season 2 (Hammers and Veils), which is supposed to be set right before Lane goes away for the summer (so later in Spring) and Rory is taking summer classes and Lorelai still says she's 32, about 5 months or so before Rory turns 17, which would have her 15 for several months of the pregnancy.

Anyone else think this is weird that the show did not make this part of the narrative? Like I said, the show's continuity is really weak on lots of things. Emily says at Lorelai's bachelorette party in Season 2 she got married 34 years ago, then in Season 5 it's her 40th anniversary with Richard. So one has to laugh at it.  But this is a pretty big plot point.

I actually don't think that Gilmore Girls is one of those shows, but there are always going to be missed opportunities. Who do you wish had shown up more? And in what context?

Christopher - I'm not a Chris fan, but I thought he was a really compelling character before he was turned into a plot device for Luke and Lorelai. One of my favorite scenes in the series is when Lorelai, Rory, and Emily tell him off in 3x02, and I would have loved to explore that more. It could have been fun watching them navigate their relationship after Gigi was born. Mostly I just liked the scenes where you couldn't tell if you were supposed to root for against him, and I think that was lost after early season 3. 

Jess - I can't take credit for this, but someone on Tumblr got me thinking about how cool it would have been for Jess to move back to Stars Hollow in season 5 after he reconciled with Luke. It would have been hard to justify why he'd agree to come back, but there was so much potential for him as an individual character. Lorelai could have reluctantly helped him get his GED (and eventually bonded with him). He would have been there to tease Luke about finally getting together with Lorelai. We could have seen him begin to write his book. It would have been easy to keep him and Rory away from each other so that she could explore separate relationships while we got to see Jess develop into the man he became. The failed spin-off makes me think Amy wanted to explore his growth on-screen too. 

Rachel - I can't think of a feasible storyline that would keep her in Stars Hollow and Lorelai's life, but she was genuinely an awesome person and I would have loved seeing her around more. 

Dave - Ugh, realistically I get that people move away for college and relationships fall apart, but it was so hard to replace him in Lane's life. He was so endearing and the perfect balance of dorky, sweet, and cool for Lane. Bringing him back would have felt convoluted, but it would have been worth it. 

Babette - Nine times out of ten I would have preferred Babette to be in a scene over any other Stars Hollow eccentrics. ",57,30,False,self,,,,,

And we saw it to some extent. But we also saw Lorelais leanings in that direction -messing with timecards and peoples livelihoods while dating Jason. Getting the wedding planner fired as a result of messing with Emily during her planning for the vow renewal. And (maybe?) the uber snarky behavior at the pool in AYITL (with Rory). 

My assumption has been that Lorelais behavior falls in that direction when she is with others from that world. 

But I just rewatched S6E3. This was the episode where -at Lorelais direction- everyone pretends TJ is the contractor on the house extension project. When TJ finds out the truth and is hurt by it (love him or hate him, the man has feelings) it is Tom and then Luke who console him and try to make him feel better. Lorelai does/says nothing. To her it was a fun game.  When Luke argued with he that they needed to tell TJ the truth - that he was not, in fact, the contractor - Lorelai replies that it was ""adorable"" that TJ polished his silver construction hat with real silver polish. She was amused by his antics and wanted them to continue so she could watch.

Then I remembered how she dragged (still innocent) Rory into an empty Chilton to carve their initials. Or dragging (still innocent) Rory into the dorms at Harvard, invading peoples space and touching their belongings. 

This made me wonder exactly how far from that world Lorelai truly was after all. Theres a lot of subtext in Emilys S5E5 were all entitled here as Emily &amp; Lorelai rifle thru Richards belongings at the pool house and Rory is the only one even remotely bothered by what they did. Maybe its her relationship with Luke that moderates her personality to (an arguably) passable level.

JESS: You see, this is your problem. You're going to help people whether they want it or not. You have to fix everything. You have to fix everyone. You think it makes you a good guy, but really, it just makes you a pain in the ass. You make it so that when people fail you, you get to feel like the martyr and they get to feel like not only did they screw up, but they also disappointed you. You interfere and you make everything worse. No one is asking for your help. No one wants your help. Focus on your own life and leave everyone else alone.

While Jess is obviously projecting on the disappointing you part, I actually... kind of see some truth in that statement? Luke helps people - his caring nature is something very loveable about him - but the more we learn from him, the more we understand this has been a pattern for him since childhood - helping his dad in the store, helping Liz after she spiraled out of control, etc. 

What I am thinking as an example of what Jess said is Luke being emotionally distant and neglectful in his relationship with Nicole but taking up the victim role when she cheats (not that I am justifying her or anything, or saying Luke was on the wrong for feeling betrayed of course), or feeling let down by Loreai dating other guys but still not having the guts to ask her out or feeling the need to meddle with Lizs love life just because he looks down on the guy shes dating (Lizs history with guys is not ideal but still).

And I was wondering - what is your assessment on Jess comment? I love Lukes character and I find it really gratifying to view him under a critical lens. :)

Hes the tortured guy with a past, with commitment issues, who reads good literature and listen to good music and hates the word and doesnt know how to be in a relationship because of his difficult childhood. Hes the cursed poet. 

I think most shy, bookish girls (I was one) have had a Jess in their life. Its almost necessary. When you are young you think love is drama, you think love is painful, you think you can save the guy through love because your idea of love is the one you have read in books. When you get older you stop looking for guys that makes you cry and you start looking for others who makes you laugh (Logan) or makes your life easier (Luke). But you wouldnt  appreciate them if you didnt previously have a Jess in your life (like Rory couldnt appreciate Dean). The earlier you have your Jess phase the better (better at 17 than at 40, for sure). Once you have learnt that, you move on. Isnt that what the Rory-Jess relationship means? Isnt that the reason Rory rejects him in Season 4 in Yale? My opinion of course. Thats why I dont see them endgame. Hes just part of her life journey. A very important part of course.

Privileges do not mean just material goods, but they also mean power. And with power a person could have an impact on many things. He or she could do something good, could help others, change bad things etc. But for such a peron some things are just forbidden (I am not talking about Rory here), but not all.

Having a baby at 16 and having one at 32 are two very different things, completely incomparable in my opinion - even if you are going to raise the child as a single mum.

I somehow think that this baby could be a good thing. The revival gave us a stagnant, passive and entitled Rory, who seemed to be caught in a loop and incapable of getting out of it. The whole Logan thing was just ridiculous, and the book? I'm not even starting on it, I consider it very lazy writing from the author of the show. I wouldn't even call it a homage to Little Women, it's just meh. 

Could this baby be a way to break out of the loop? Rory is so self-centered and lost in her life that who knows, maybe such a shake-up could eventually prove to be the positive thing she needed. After all, Lorelai has always stated that Rory was the best thing that ever happened to her, and I have no doubt that it will eventually be the same for Rory.

P.S: I'm not mentioning abortion because it doesn't ever seem to be an option on this show - I think only Emily hinted at it once, speaking with Rory. Besides, as she could have been aborted herself had the situation been different, I really think she wouldn't resort to that.

Any thoughts about this?

They weren't living together, they hadn't met each other's families, Max was out of town while they were planning the wedding... I understand that sometimes people fall in love and the relationship moves quickly, but I think that shouldn't stop them from having like...an actual discussion about what their life will look like. Max only spent the night for the first time two weeks before the wedding (and it doesn't seem like Lorelai occasionally slept at his place, but I don't know for sure). They knew so little about each other that Rory's 16 year old boyfriend had to ""teach"" Max how to seamlessly fit in with them. It's really jarring that I'm older. I have a hard time believing that either of them would have been so thoughtless about getting married. Lorelai broke up with Max the first time because Rory was getting teased about it, but she thought it was fine marrying him without putting any thought into their future as a family? Max gets so upset when he realizes that he doesn't know what his role in their household will be, and I get that, but I don't understand how it took him so long to have that conversation. I kind of feel like Amy changed her mind about Max sometime between seasons 1 and 2 and just wanted to break them up ASAP. 

Also they didn't send out invitations until two weeks before the wedding??? Is that CRAZY to anyone else? They had been engaged for at least two months! I know Emily was just trying to prove a point, but at that point, Lorelai really was lucky that they weren't out of town. ",27,61,False,self,,,,,

And I know a rather popular opinion on this sub is that Logan was Rory's most healthy/best relationship, so I'd be interested in a little discussion.

I never really thought Logan was healthy for Rory.  Lorelai has a very strong point when they start dating, and Luke reiterates this in the episode where they all go to Martha's Vineyard: that Logan is so hot and cold and it's awful for Rory.  One minute Rory's sobbing in the bathroom because Logan's ignoring her, then the next day they're exclusive.  He lets his sister inform Rory that they're broken up, then has to nerve to embarrass Rory by having a coffee cart follow her around campus after he won't leave her alone despite her multiple requests.  He brings his very obviously gorgeous long time friend as a date to a function where he knows Rory will be, knowing full well that she'll see and get worked up.

Then onto Logan himself.  First of all, his attitude sucks.  He speaks down to anyone he deems beneath him.  He claims to care so much about Rory but is blatantly disrespectful towards her on several occasions.  Again, not respecting her wishes that he just leave her alone after he used his sister to second hand dump her, and having the nerve to act like he doesn't understand why Rory is upset.  Being so pissy and awful towards Rory's friends (Marty and Jess).  His little game of ""take a knicknack, leave a knicknack"" at Richard and Emily's house - how someone gets to 20-22 years of age and sees that meeting your girlfriend's family is NOT the time or place is beyond me.  I don't see what Rory sees in him beyond him being charming at times, good looking, and fun.  Which is the basis of the majority of college relationships to be fair, but he never came across as this end all be all end game for Rory like the show painted him.

Also, I really don't buy into the ""poor little rich boy"" bit that the show uses to get us to sympathize with him.  Yes, his future is preplanned and as far as he knows, going against the wishes of the Huntzberger empire could end up with him disowned, cut off, etc.  But Logan will still have an education from fucking Yale and even if he and his family are on the outs, he still has the Huntzberger name in his arsenal.  Logan is socially adept and manipulative enough to use that to his advantage.  He could walk away and live his life of freedom and do perfectly well for himself, he just wouldn't be draped in riches the way he is currently.

1.	I dont think Logan was cheating. When you have a fight with your boyfriend and you dont talk to him for weeks, not even on the phone, you are broken up, maybe not officially, but at least you are in a break.

2.	I totally understand that Rory was upset. Being in a room where your boyfriend has slept with 3 out of 4 of the girls just in a National Holiday it must be humiliating. I will be scared about his level of promiscuity too and Im not a prude. At least Rory knew he was like that before they started their casual relationship.  

But the point I want to make is something that, if I were Rory, will help me understand Logan. Because in this episode we see that is not just Logan or his friends that are promiscuous. It seems like his whole world is. The girls have no problem admitting that they have slept with the same guy, their best friends little brother, by the way, more or less around the same day. They dont care, its just a joke for them, of course it didnt mean anything to any of them. Im not judging here, I have nothing against promiscuity if its between consenting adults. Then one of the girls also admits that shes in a serious relationship with her boyfriend and still fooling around with Logan. Cheating its not important either. I guess its a reflection of how upper class people relate to sex or how Amy thinks they do. It seems thats the kind of girls Logan has grown up with, the kind of girls he has always been surrounded by. Im not justifying here, just trying to understand. Maybe this is also the kind of girl hes going to marry? Odette may be a French Megan or Alexandra and thats why he doesnt care to take Rory to restaurants all over London while hes engaged?

In the scene where Gran calls Lorelai a failure because shes got no money left, which causes a fight between Richard and Gran, Jason is sitting across the table. 

I have triple checked to make sure he didnt leave the room and he didnt. Hes just right there, across the way from Lorelai. 

They never pan to him to show his reaction and thats weird enough, but whats even weirder is the fact that they never show Jason and Lorelai talking about the fact that Lorelais inn is failing, or her feelings about her grandmother calling her out like that..

Maybe I should just accept it as a time issue, or a pacing thing, or just that they wanted Luke to be the person who comforted her. But its so freaking odd to me. Hes her bf of FIVE months and they dont have a conversation about the giant emotional deluge that just happened? Or that her career is $30,000 away from being in the toilet?

In another thread, all of ASP's writing ""crutches"" got brought up. Her tendency to throw in cheating, or pregnancy, or have literally everyone be romantically hung up on Rory... there are so many to choose from and they often drag down the show. 

So, which plot line would you EDIT to remove her writing crutch? It would still be the same basic idea, but written better. 

I'm not talking about whole themes (lack of communication) you would remove, or whole archs (APRIL YOU DAMN FOOL) you would get rid of. I'm talking about big plot points that weren't horrible ideas, but didn't pan out as well as they could have because of poor writing and it hinders the show moving forward. It becomes repetitive, or boring, or just not as poignant as it could be. 

For me, it's when Lorelai and Luke break up the first time. I would not have had Emily tell Chris to come. I think it would have been a lot more moving, interesting, and realistic if Chris had just been invited. Chris, Lorelai, and Rory could all be talking about music or movies or memories, and Luke could be feeling really left out and excluded because that's not really something he has in common with the girls. Emily and Richard could come over and be super affectionate to Christopher, maybe have a high school friend of Chris and Lor's come over and talk to them. It would still end up with Luke feeling insecure and Luke and Lorelai breaking up, but it would be for a far more legitimate, moving reason. And it wouldn't be patched up by Emily going to say ""She wants you Luke."" THEY would have to actually work out their shit. 

I would also have Lorelai be a little confused about if Chris isn't the person she really wants. And even maybe have Emily help her work through it instead of reverting back to one of ASP's favorite writing crutches: Emily is Satan and Ruins Everything.

I was ok with her first year at Yale but after that I didn't really care for it . Rory lost who she was as a character, what made me so eager to root for her throughout the show was her character and her devotion to her education.  When she graduated and the show became about her and her various boyfriends I really lost interest. Paris's story lines felt tacked on to pad the run time of the show. I did like the Richard and Emily story line but other than that I quickly lost interest. The will they or won't they with Luke became tiresome very quickly and the entire saga with Lane was also superfluous. I would have preferred if the show had ended with her leaving triumphantly to go to Harvard. The graduation episode seemed a natural stopping point for the show. The tension with Max and Christopher alleviated the need for Jason and Rory could have split politely with Dean and left to pursue her dream, Lane would reconcile her double life and gain the acceptance of her mother. Lorelei would make amends with her parents. If the last 4 seasons made me lose my respect for Rory and my interest in the show, the ""Year in the life "" destroyed any vestige of respect and interest. The motivated, kind person we were introduced to in the first season was replaced by an entitled , flighty , self centered character incapable of accomplishing her goals. But the tragic thing about the ending was that besides her none of the characters showed any capacity for change at all ( with the notable exception of  Emily) . Lorelei is still the same commitment-phobe as she was at the start, Kirk is still odd for the sake of being odd , Patty is still eccentric , Babbette still abrasive , Taylor is still affable , genial and vaguely paternalistic and Gypsy still sardonic. Sookie and Jackson are absent. The entire thing has an air of being retread and actually diminishes  my appreciation for the rest of the show. Stars Hollow seemed idyllic during seasons one to three but by the end it was just too real. Lastly the twist did nothing for me and I don't understand why it was necessary. It was an attempt at narrative symmetry but not really and only served to further complicate an already ambiguous ending further.",8,0,False,spoiler,,,,,

I'm rewatching the entire series right now and just got to S2E5, in which he's a total dick to pretty much everyone.

I'm not a Jess apologist but I really enjoy the Rory/Jess storyline. The way I see it, Rory falls for Dean because he's both cute and a good kid but they don't have all that much in common. She falls for Logan because he's exciting. But she falls for Jess because they genuinely have something in common, which is why I think their connection is the most interesting.
