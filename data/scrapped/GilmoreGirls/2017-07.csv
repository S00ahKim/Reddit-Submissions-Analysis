Strangely, the very friends with benefits arrangement Rory and Logan transition out of in the original series is much like the one they end up in in the revival.

I knew what I wanted to happen, and it didn't. So I felt burnt. 

I took a couple of months off of Gilmore Girls. Then I went all the way back to the beginning and watched from episode one. 

It was so refreshing to go back to the beginning, the show we all fell in love with (or we wouldn't be here, right?). It was great to go back to a show that felt like home, and just enjoy the day to day life of these women. Fall in love with them all over again. Experience the heartbreaks all over again. Hate Anna Nardini all over again. 

Then I got to the revival. I was able to watch it energized, not at 3am on release day. I was able to enjoy it, not rushing through to find out those last 4 words. Not worrying about who she would end up with. Just enjoying the ride. Here's what I found. 

Overall, I loved it. 

I loved the musical. It was reminiscent of the weird but entertaining Kirk musical from the OS. Should it have been shorter? Maybe. But I was more able to enjoy it when I knew what was coming at the end and didn't feel so rushed. 

I was more open to the idea of Rory struggling. Journalism is a hard area. My dad is a journalist. We've had feast years and famine years. Rory had her feast before we came onto the scene, and she had her famine while we were watching. It makes sense. She's only 30. And I'd say an article in the New Yorker isn't that bad of a starting point. I know, I know, we expected more from Rory. But we expected more because her family expected more. She got out into the world and she was just slightly above average- which is an okay thing to be. 

I'm happier this time to see the characters are flawed. I know we don't always watch shows to see real life. But this is real life. People struggle with things. Rory is entitled. She just plain is. She looks at herself through rose colored glasses, courtesy of her mom, grandma, and grandpa. Lorelai is childish. She struggles with commitment and letting others into her life. Emily is too austere. Chris is a flake. This is what people are like in real life. And for the first time since watching the revival, I'm okay with that being the story told here. 

What I'm not okay with: 

Not finding out who the dad is. I know that Logan is supposed to be the dad. I know we are supposed to infer that. But we should have gotten the satisfaction of finding out. Not finding out what is going to happen- who she's going to end up with. I think we all feel robbed of that one. I know that's not what Amy wanted us to concentrate on, but we did. We all care. Even if she just wanted to raise the baby alone, we'd like to know. And we'd like to know if Logan is ever told. 

That Jess is still pining. I know some people think he isn't, but after rewatching I'm absolutely positive he is. [This is not the face of someone who is over it.](http://imgur.com/a/oGb3V) And I hate to think that after all this time, Jess is still hurting. But, I guess that's real life. 

So, it all boils down to feeing like I was screwed out of a real ending. Even after all this, we don't get to know. We spent years debating, wondering, writing fan fic ;), and we still don't get to know. I think that's where my animosity came from in the beginning, and why some still lingers. 

If you've made it this far, you're a champ :) Leave your thoughts, I'd love to hear them. ",43,113,False,spoiler,,,,,

So I looked her up on the IMDB. I didn't know that she was married to Jackson in real life! And they had a boy and a girl, and that the pilot was originally shot with her playing Sookie. She couldn't get out of her contractual obligations so they recast and re-shot with MM.

I'm not sure where the rumour comes from - did Amy say it herself during an interview? Does anyone have a link? I wonder if she, or the media, may be exaggerating for some strange reason because this is what she said on the matter at the ATX Festival panel in 2015:

&gt; ""I didn't, like, binge it [season 7]. I've seen it because weirdly I have ABC Family on a lot - I don't really know what that says about me! They still run Gilmore on a crazy loop and every now and then there'd be something on that I hadn't seen. I'd be like 'Oh I don't remember Alexis's hair being like that', or 'What was that walk and talk...and why wasn't it longer.' So I'd catch...I sort of caught up just by having my TV on too much.""

(Watch [here](https://youtu.be/Dh0Tw7qyZ0o?t=1h15m45s))

It sounds to me like she pretty much knew the storyline of S7 before writing the revival, and maybe doesn't feel as bitter about the whole situation as we often assume.

I'm now 6 episodes into season 7 and I'm enjoying it soooo much more than I thought. Maybe it's the fact that season 6 was a huge train wreck in comparison or that I had very low expectations, or if it's the mix of the two, but the show is FUN again.

I never liked Christopher, but so far I'm finding him and Lorelai to be such a great match. The fact that he is so open with her all the time and has the same interests is such a huge welcome change to the Lorelai/Luke drama from season 6 (even though I'll always be rooting for those two). Rory seems to be acting like a grownup for a change. April/Anna aren't getting nearly the attention/screentime I thought they would, and the show is genuinely ""happy"" again.

I have to admit I had very low expectations coming into this final season. Aside from the things I've heard about people hating this season so much, I just couldn't stand season 6. Truly, in my opinion, one of the worst seasons of television I have ever seen (and I watch--and sometimes review--a LOT of TV).

So maybe that factored into why I found season 7 to be really good. It felt fun and happy again for a change. Sure, some things didn't work (Lorelai/Christopher getting married, the whole Marty thing wtf) but as a whole, I enjoyed this season. I know a lot of people seem to find the early seasons to be generally better, but to be honest I think I liked the second half of season 7 just as much.

Then we have the last 4 episodes. Again, this is just my opinion, but those were 4 of my favorite episodes of Gilmore Girls. Not only was the series finale PERFECT in every way, but the last shot of our Gilmore girls at Luke's diner is truly an unforgettable bookend to this unique series. I'm not ashamed to admit I cried a couple of times in that final hour.

Now I've been warned about the revival...A LOT. I definitely want to watch it because I'm so intrigued to see where our colorful characters are after all these years, but I'll wait just a little bit.

They are nearly always holding hands, linking arms, snuggling, etc, all things we rarely saw from Lorelai with her previous boyfriends (especially Luke and Jason). We also hear Lorelai say ""I love you"" multiple times, which is *very* unusual. There's definitely a difference, which is strange considering we're later shown that Lorelai is kidding herself about the relationship. 

I, for one, find this quite interesting. Worth a bit of analysis?

These are the possible explanations I can come up with - let's play multiple choice:

a) It's a difference in the showrunners. ASP didn't want Lorelai to be the PDA type but Rosenthal encouraged it. Maybe a relationship with Chris under ASP would have been just as restrained, while a Luke relationship under DSR would have included more explicit affection?

b) It's meant to show that even tons of affection can't make Chris ""right"". It sort of makes the break-up more significant because everything is right apart from Lorelai's head.

c) It shows how weird Lorelai is being - that the relationship is too ""try hard"".

d) It's just their dynamic, going back to when they were teenagers, but Lorelai doesn't ""need"" it with anyone else.

e) Lauren Graham is far more comfortable with David Sutcliffe. Probably the simplest answer, and it makes sense since she's mentioned several times how much she enjoyed working with him. But she also said the same about Chris Eigerman. And it kind of sucks to think she let her personal feelings dictate aspects of the Lorelai relationships?

f) They genuinely are happy at the start and having a better relationship than the others. Ehh I don't buy it, but let's put the option in there.

But it seems insane to me the way they talk about Chilton as if it's the only way Rory could ever get ahead. Stars Hollow High certainly didn't seem like a particularly awful place. In my mind, it seems that Rory would stand out academically and be smart enough to find opportunities to pursue her interests. (I was also confused about her freak out about extra curriculars? It seems like she was pretty active in town charity events and could easily spin a lot of those experiences. It also seemed weird to me that she wouldn't be aware that just good grades weren't enough to get into Harvard?? Another post, I guess!)

And watching Rory just automatically go to her grandparents for Yale tuition just made me kind of sad. All the kids I went to high school with were in the same boat as me: Poor, but hard working and I saw a LOT of really deserving kids turn down acceptances from ivies and other great schools because even with financial aid they couldn't afford it.  It just seems like the stakes are not quite as dire when one steps back from the Stars Hollow bubble. 

Obviously, these moments are the basis for the epic FND and without them we wouldn't have our precious GG. Most of the time I can suspend belief and just roll with it. But I was just wondering if these moments kind of stung for anyone else of a similar background? When I was younger the whole college application/Yale thing filled me with a lot of complicated emotions. Now that I'm older, I'm not half as torn up about it, but these premises seem so silly.

I know the revival it's old news now, but I tagged spoiler anyway.

I kept thinking, if Logan accepts Rory's baby, do you think the surname would be Huntzberger or Gilmore?
