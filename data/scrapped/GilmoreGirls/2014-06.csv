Watching it now I've noticed that lighting is definitely different, it always looks darker therefore the lighting looks more dramatic all of the time. Also, there's waaay less musical accompaniment, the troubadour is barely there until the last episode and  the Sam Phillips queues are extremely rare. I guess the fact that this is such a sad season for Lorelai doesn't help the unpleasant feelings that I have for it (mostly the second half) but I feel like it's more than that.
