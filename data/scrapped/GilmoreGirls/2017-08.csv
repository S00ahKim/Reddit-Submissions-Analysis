Most of us think that Luke is the one for Lorelai. But Emily disagrees. Whether or not she is right, from her perspective Luke will make her daughter unhappy, because he is going to hold her back. 

It wasnt a huge leap of faith on Emilys part that if Sherry hadnt gotten pregnant, Lorelai and Chris would have been able to make it work and that now, Luke is something like a second choice. So, now Emily sees her daugher getting serious with this man who she is convinced is not going to make her happy. She remembers how devastated Lorelai was when she was unable to be with Christopher because his girlfriend got pregnant. So from Emilys POV, there is this guy who is not good enough for her daugher and the man who she was supposed to end up with had the timing not always worked against them. Why was it so wrong of her to go to Christopher and inform him that soon, it will be too late altogether? 

People (including Lorelai and Rory on the show) act like Emily badmouthed Luke around town, spread lies about him to Lorelai or offered him money to break up with her daugher (or blackmailed him into doing it). But she did nothing of the sort. The only thing she did is talked to the man she thought would make her daugher happy and informed him that Lorelai is getting serious with another man and that if he still wanted to be with Lorelai, he would have to make a move soon. Sorry, but I cant find anything wrong with this. Isnt this what any loving parent would do if they saw their child getting serious with somebody who they thought wasnt the right person for them? Isnt this what Lorelai herself would have done if she was in Emilys position? I really dont get the hate, the woman just informed Christopher about the fact that Lorelai was falling in love with another man.

I think she gets unfairly blamed for everything that Christopher did wrong. It wasnt Emilys fault that Christopher got drunk, publicly declared his love for Lorelai and humiliated Luke. I bet Emily wasnt so pleased to find out such a spectacle had taken place at her oh-so-proper society party. Those were Christophers mistakes, not Emilys. I wonder if Christopher had acted like an adult and just talked to Lorelai, would the girls (and fans) be still so hostile towards Emily? If Chris just had informed Lorelai that he was still in love with her and willing to try and that she sould factor his feelings into her decision what would be so wrong about that? Didn't Lorelai deserve to know all her ""options""?

And sorry, Emily couldnt have predicted that at the first sign of trouble, Luke would bolt. Rory accused Emily of breaking up Lorelai and Luke, but she didnt. Like I said, she did not force Luke to leave or tricked Lorelai into leaving him. Not even Christopher broke them up. Luke is the one who broke up Lorelai and Luke.",67,32,False,self,,,,,

I remember reading it all the time - it virtually became folklore. But these days I'm noticing far more positive comments about the series finale: people acknowledging that it was a nice send-off that allowed the characters to continue in our imaginations with a happy future ahead of them.

This is certainly the case with me, anyway. My opinion largely changed after comparing it with AYITL, which suggested that our characters had made very little positive progress in the intervening years and ended with an unsatisfying cliffhanger. Suddenly, Bon Voyage seems like a nice place to leave them and I realised we had it pretty good with that finale. But I also think that with the space, time, and removed expectations, fans were able to see that it *does* work as a series finale. People watching along at the time were only told about the cancellation 12 days before it aired, so immediately went into ""this is rushed and unsatisfying"" mode, and were especially frustrated that it ended after a disappointing season without the Palladinos. Now that the frustration has died down (or in the case of people discovering the show on Netflix, never experienced it in the first place), I think people are able to be more objective. 

...ie, The last few episodes *do* build with a lot of weight and emotion, and it's clearly a logical place to end the show: Rory graduating from college and leaving Stars Hollow. The writers knew that there was a good chance of it being the final episode and treated it that way. Ending it with a party and send-off gives it that feeling of finality (compared to any other season finales, anyway), and the last few scenes all have a poignant feel to them. All of the scenes involving the Gilmores have that feeling of being sad and scared about parting ways, but with optimism and knowing it needs to happen. I think that's the perfect tone for the end of Gilmore Girls. 

That said, other aspects certainly could have been better. The Lorelai-Luke reconciliation doesn't get the weight and attention that it should, and neither does the Rory-Logan break up. If I'm honest, I think Lauren and Alexis should have officially announced in advance that they didn't want to renew their contracts and allowed the writers to clearly tie all the ends. It's clear from contemporary interviews such as [this](http://www.veoh.com/watch/v757370nZSgR49d/LaurenGrahamtalkshows), [this](http://www.tvguide.com/news/lauren-grahams-final-8429/), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjTRlZffngM) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1VXavOjivg), that the girls were tired and ready to move on - which is totally fair and understandable so I wish they had made that definite decision earlier, rather than vaguely committing to something that was never really going to work and that the network eventually decided not to renew (a shorter season where the girls worked less). It would have been fairer to the rest of the cast and of course - the fans. Although it does sound like they genuinely didn't realise people might be disappointed by the ending until they started getting that feedback. I think there's regret involved now, but...hmm.

So I was watching Keg! Max! (one of my actual least favourite episodes for obvious reasons) but anyway, Rory and Jess run into Dean and Lindsay at Kyle(?)'s party and they start talking about music and Lindsay's like 'I like Michelle Branch and Matchbox 20/ other mainstream music blah blah blah' and Jess is *super* disparaging. And it got me thinking about just *how* snobbish a lot of the characters (Jess, Rory, Paris, even Lane with music) are about things like books, movies, music, tv, etc. 

Like 'oh my God, you don't get this reference to an obscure sci-fi movie from the 1950s?? You're dumb' or 'have you heard of this little book called The Great Gatsby??' 

Rory especially is like Belle from Beauty and the Beast, whining about how there has to be 'more than this provincial life' and 'the other girls in town are more interested in fashion than reading so I must be better than them'. IIRC she was just so surprised Dean got a Moby Dick reference when they met? Like isn't Moby Dick required reading at most high schools?

And Paris pretty much hates everyone, but there were a lot of instances in season 1 where she was rude to and about Madeline and Louise because they were more interested in boys than school and in season 5 she was having issues with Doyle and she asked for advice from Janet and Althea (?) and Rory's like: 'you hate them' and Paris' backhanded compliment basically amounted to they're dumb but good with boys. 

And Jess is very much the intellectually superior type while spouting off some very basic AP English authors ((Hemingway, Salinger, Rand) but that seems to be an ASP thing, more than anything) and being very dismissive towards anyone he deems 'dumb' or 'intellectually inferior', Dean being the obvious example. 

Emily gets a lot of crap for being snobbish and elitist which she absolutely is, but I find intellectual elitism just as grating especially since a lot of intellectual elitism is coded classism (Jess being an obvious exception). 

All this to say, I think ASP has a huge problem with framing characters who are more well read or more pop culture savvy are 'smarter' than people who aren't and therefore are 'better' than everyone else. Like, dude is Rory really a special snowflake 'because she reads'?

As horribly, utterly tragic as Ed Herrmann's death is (R.I.P. you wonderful man), I can't help but appreciate the life it gave to Emily's storyline; there's no way they would have killed off Richard if Ed were still around, and honestly Emily never would have had the character development that she did if Richard were still around. 

I truly believe Revival-Emily is some of the best Emily we see in the entire show. Kelly Bishop always nails the role, but in the revival she fucking *kills it*! We get to see Emily shaken to her core, stripped of everything that used to give her meaning; after decades of being ""Richard's wife"" she must now redefine herself and create a new life. It's something she clearly never expected or prepared for, and it's completely beautiful to see her evolution across the 4 episodes.

I am utterly in love with how she takes in her maid's family as her own, becomes a volunteer at the whaling museum, and moves on to a new chapter. She finds her passions as an individual and creates new meaning for herself. She doesn't forget Richard, but finds a way to live meaningfully without him.

To add insult to injury, in this episode Luke goes to find TJ at a bar to confront him about walking out on Liz and their baby. After TJ tells Luke what really happened, they both sit at the bar and discuss why Liz may have gone off the way she did. Luke tells TJ that she wasn't talking about TJ, but about herself and her fears of being a bad parent (I assume teen Jess flashbacks). Luke goes on to tell TJ that ""sometimes people don't say what they mean"" and that you have to ""tune in to what your partner needs as opposed to what she's actually saying."" Going on to say that their job is to ""try to figure out what she's saying for what she actually says."" 

I find it very interesting that he's able to give TJ this ""sound"" advice when his own fianc has been struggling with his disappearance from the relationship for months and him not being able to see it. Or was it denial?

I don't mean to sound like a Luke-hater. I really am not. I waited forever for these two to get together and in the beginning they were doing really great. And then somewhere along the line they started to lose their way.

I honestly can in some way understand Richard and Emily's attitude, she was just a child.

- Was Marty originally intended to be a love interest? And then the writers changed their mind?

- We must feel bad for Dana. Another character created to put Rory in the epitome of greatness. She just had to be extremely weird? Speaking disability? Checked. Always confused? Checked. Stupid enough to wear Rory's uniform? Checked.

- Their common room is spacious, and yet Janet had to do her pushups in front of Rory. Yet another attempt to show off how weird everyone else is. Why does the show push this narrative too much?!

- How rich is this kid having a party?

- Kids fighting at the party, one said r*t**d. I guess it was ok to say that on tv back then?

- Lorelai joking to a kid about Brazilian bikini wax...

- Lorelai looked so beautiful in this episode, though.

- OH NO. This stupid conflict about the food for a kid's birthday party. Why did they write the episode this way? No way was this redeemable, even after Sookie talked about her being scared about being a mother.

- Another Rory and Marty moment. 

- Here comes another set of ""quirky"" people. The twins thinking of a nickname for her, not letting her speak. I swear, this episode really pushed it too much with the ""quirkiness"" around Rory. It's just ridiculous.

- Sookie made a cake with rum raisin for a children's birthday party. Because that's what every pregnant lady does, with all the crazy hormones. Argh. Who wrote this episode?!

At the end of S4 and start of S5 Lane starts to get infatuated with Zack, and when she calls Rory to talk about it in S5, Rory isn't all like ""wow Lane, you have a boyfriend, even if long distance, remember that"". So we can assume she's no longer with Dave by then. I think the last time he's actually mentioned is when Mrs. Kim wanted to send him that jug that Lane thought it was a marriage order; Lane mentions that her and Dave had a fight about it so it would be safe to assume that that's when they broke up, but by the end when Lane confronts Mrs. Kim she mentions how much she loves Dave so it's fair to think they're still together then. So, what did I miss? Was Dave mentioned again or just forgotten?

*""I hate President Bush, and the British are coming.""
What the blazes was Lorelai thinking making a comment like that?  The night would've ended with a rehash of the family blowout sixteen years earlier anyway, but oh dear.  Her in-laws looked about ready to explode as soon as they arrived, and Straub would have gone off sooner or later, but that kind of comment just reinforces his opinion of her.  It wasn't a comment meant for discussion; she threw a log in the fire.  She behaves like a child.  She pulled the same childish, embarrassing baloney at Richard's memorial.   This is one of the reasons she and Emily are always at odds; Lorelai takes pleasure in mocking their life.    Why would she tell such a story at her father's memorial, especially a story that relates to the embarrassment she brought to the family?    ""I feel sixteen.""  You are two, honey.

*The Haydens 
These people are the worst.   Lorelai seduced their sweet, innocent boy, and then went on to start a life from scratch on her own living in a shed with an infant.   What exactly stood in the way of Christopher going to Princeton?  He didn't face the discomfort of pregnancy, the pain of childbirth, and the horrifying prospect of raising a child with no help of any kind.   At least Richard acknowledged sixteen years ago that it takes two to tango.   I wonder what they think of the mysterious start up company he probably funded  with their money, and his second tango dance with Sherri?  

*Chris 
Sex in this episode, sex in the wedding episode whilst still in limbo with Sherri, and sex after Lorelai's fight with Luke.  It's mostly physical. He takes what he can get from Lorelai, and he's too weak to realize he deserves better than to be Lorelai's rebound time and time again.   Why wasn't he more involved in Rory's life?  Lorelai was kind enough to let him show up on his own time and terms.   Rory is just part of the package.
