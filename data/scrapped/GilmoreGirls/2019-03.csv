I was born in 1999 to a 20 year old mother and a 22 year old father. My father was always working and my mom and I were really close. They divorced when I was 6 and my mother has been basically a single mother since.

My mother has a TERRIBLE mother and no father, so she has to support herself like Lorelai tried to.

My mother was 19 when she got pregnant, not far off from Lorelai's 16. 

My mother goes out of her way to help people. Throughout my childhood she's taken in three single friends, a family with two kids with behavior/developmental issues, and her four underage brothers (after calling CPS on her mom). 

She is always the one that people come to at work for help.

She's put herself through college.

She moved out at 16 and lived above a bar (she lied about her age) while going to work full time at night and school full time during the day. She graduated on time. 

Lorelai is like my mother but with more money, a better set of parents, and a few more childish tendencies. Before I knew what the show was about I used to watch it with her. I know because an episode of Gilmore Girls is literally my first memory of my life. 

I rediscovered it on Netflix in high school and 4 years later I'm still obsessed. ",16,15,False,self,,,,,

In season 1 he appeared to be the charming, attractive loser many sixteen year old girls find hot. That\`s why  I was fine with Lorelai letting him off the hook for being a lousy father, after all what can you do about uselessness? 

But after season 2 and 3 and him sleeping with Lorelai, giving Rory false hope for a family, then returning to Sherry and asking Lorelai to become his mistress while Emily watched I really wanted someone to verbally kick his ass very hard. However, instead of telling him off in season 4 when Chris finally decides to call again because he needs help with his newest child, Lorelai jumps to his rescue. And after a short period of being angry, Rory does the same. Of course Chris is not thankful for their forgiving natures. Instead he decides to break up  Lorelai\`s relationship because, since Sherry is gone now, Lorelai once again belongs with him. At this point I was pretty sure we would finally see Lorelai and Rory giving Chris the grief he deserved, but instead he calls again one year later and is forgiving instantly because...reasons. 

Even in season 7, when Lorelai and Chis\`s marriage ends, he gets portrayed as the victim, despite the fact that he slept with a distraught Lorelai the same night she ended her engagement, he pressured her into marriage, he wanted to have yet another baby out of jealousy and he decided to not be there for her when her dad got sick. And than when the revival comes around instead of Rory FINALLY telling Chris what an awful father he was to her and how he only ever knew her when he wanted to sleep with Lorelai, we get another lame excuse form Chris and a sad expression from Rory.

Summary of a long rant: I really wish ASP would have given her lead characters the chance to tell Chris how his awful behavior affecting them in a AYITL. What I would have loved even more is for Chris to realize that he was to blame for losing both of them and regretting his actions instead of giving his lame ""force of nature excuse"".

***Note: This will be more in-depth than usual as it is a pivotal episode. Episodes in which something culminates or is introduced, I will write it out as a scene analysis. The pilot introduces something almost every scene so...***

**Scene one:**

*Setting: Lukes diner.*

Character introduction(s): Lorelai and Luke, Rory.

Lorelai and Luke are introduced together, something I very much appreciate. From the opening shot, you understand that the story at least partially follows Lorelai, but the fact that he has a name implies that he is at least some sort of important to the show.

Their banter characterizes Luke nicely here. He cares more about personal health than sales. Most business owners wouldnt care, but hes telling her she buys too much coffee from him. You see him pouring other patrons coffee, however. It shows that this is Lorelai-specific. There could be an argument that shes the only one that comes in that often, but because shes the main character I assume it is something Luke only bothers to say to Lorelai.

The way Rory is introduced is by highlighting the way that her personality contrasts her mothers. She asks for lipgloss and when presented with candy flavors she asks for something more neutral. Lorelai doesnt have anything simple, instead presenting unflavored but mood-reflecting lip gloss that Rory accepts along with a CD that her mother stole.

Lorelai and Luke have another small moment together when Lorelai asks for coffee for Rory, receiving a disapproving or skeptical look- I cant decide which.

While they do look incredibly similar, this scene provides fundamental character differences before continuing to say that they are nearly the same person for the rest of the episode. Despite these differences, it does end with the two of them scaring off a set of college boys that were interested in the pair of them.

**Key concepts:**

Luke and Lorelai are in constant contact.

Lorelai loves coffee.

Lorelai is more childish than her daughter.

Rory is 16.

**THEME SONG!**  


**Scene 2:**

*Setting: Independence Inn- front desk.*

Character introduction(s): Michel, Drella.

Michels introduction shows him to be grumpy and generally sarcastic, though he does know what hes talking about. His constant refrain of Im sorry, were completely booked shows that the inn is actually very popular for the next few weeks, not just at the moment.

Drella then enters and is rude to clients while she moves her towering harp. Lorelai attempts to reprimand her for speaking to guests this way, showing the audience that shes the boss. However, this attempt is unsuccessful, showing that Drella is obstinate.

Michel, now off the phone, gives Lorelai the phone so that she might call back an inefficient plumber and within two minutes Lorelai has made sure that the inn will not be charged and the plumber will fix what he was supposed to fix before.

When Rory shows up and asks for stamps Michel says no, but Lorelai overrides him. This again proves that Lorelai is the boss. Lorelai also teases her daughter for dressing too conservatively, something that proves their relationship to be different than most.

**Key Concepts:**

Lorelai runs the inn and is the boss of Michel and Drella

Lorelai is unconventional in terms of boss-employee relationships

**Scene 3:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow- high school.*

Character introduction(s): Lane.

Lane and Rory are walking to school, talking about how Lanes parents are incredibly strict. Lane talks about how they disagree on music and even American portion sizes. When Lane changes her shirt it is made clear that Lane not only disagrees but secretly rebels against her parents.

It is said that Lane has to go on an arranged date with a Korean boy that will be a doctor someday.

While talking, Lane and Rory pass an unknown boy. Hes clearly interested in what theyre saying.

Hell be important.

**Key Concepts:**

Lanes parents are immigrants.

Lanes parents are strict.

Lane rebels against her parents secretly.

Theres a boy at the school that is (most likely) interested in Rory.

**Scene 4:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow High- classroom.*

In class, Rory focuses on work while girls around her pass nail polish and gossip about her.

**Key Concepts:**

Rory doesnt fit in, doesnt have many friends.

**Scene 5:**

*Setting: Independence Inn- front desk.*

Character introduction(s): Sookie

Drella is playing the harp for an older woman and stops to introduce a tacky tin can for a tip jar. Lorelai cannot take care of this because she is distracted by a crash from the kitchens.

*Setting: Independence Inn- kitchen.*

Sookie, the cook, has fallen down. Its apparently a common occurrence. The two other cooks are scolded for letting her hurt herself, implying that it is even more common than previously caught.

Surrounded by pots and pans on the floor, Lorelai tries to scold Sookie but is interrupted by Sookies tasting spoon. This changes topics to how Sookie and Lorelai are planning on eventually opening their own inn and solidifies Sookie as Lorelais best friend.

**Key Concepts:**

Sookie is incredibly clumsy, everyone is used to it.

The other cooks are partially there for Sookies wellbeing.

Sookie and Lorelai are best friends.

They plan on opening an inn together.

**Scene 5:**

*Setting: Kims Antiques*

Character introduction(s): Mrs. Kim

Rory and Lane enter Lanes home/her familys store, Lane now wearing Kim-appropriate clothing.

They have to shout to find Kim, a comedic bit of Marco Polo taking place while they wander the stacks. This is mostly unaided by Mrs. Kim, who seems to think thatnext to the table is any sort of help in a disorganized furniture store. While I do find it funny, it also characterizes Mrs. Kim oddly. Someone who gives such an unhelpful suggestion seems to make her either dumb or self-centered. She doesnt seem to be unintelligent, so it only seems that the latter is possible as theres no way Lane would be able to understand what she means. The fact that she tends tonot trust unmarried women is also a general point against her likability upon first meeting. She hates Lorelai and theres really no reason.

Once they meet in the kitchen, Lane is told to go to her room for tea (probably without sugar) and a bland rock hard biscuit. She then asks if anyones gotten pregnant and dropped out, leading Rory to respond with a joke-confirmation. Its an r/wooosh moment if youve ever seen one. Then Mrs. Kim says thatboys dont like funny girls. What a peach.

**Key Concepts:**

Lane wasnt kidding about how strict her parents are.

Mrs. Kim doesnt like Lorelai.

You definitely feel bad for Lanes tongue... and teeth.

**Scene 6**:

*Setting: Independence Inn- kitchen*

This starts out as a choreographed example of how tornado-like Sookie is. Shes honestly a hazard to her own health to the point where youd want to baby proof her entire house. Only NERF knives without adult supervision.

Lorelai enters and scares Sookie, causing her to knock a cook to the ground with a heavy metal frying pan (big oof), though he bounces back like one of those punching bag balloon clowns. Maybe hes used to the concussions.

Either way, Lorelai announces that Rory was accepted into Chilton! Celebration! She didnt even have to do the principle. This is the first time that Rorys life plan is laid out for us, detailing Harvard as goal #1. Rory has always wanted to go to Harvard.

Rory enters the kitchen, looking for her mother, and is surprised to find her giggling with Sookie.

&gt;R: Did you do something slutty?  
L:Im not that happy.

Sookie ends up blowing the surprise by shouting it out and Lorelai hands over the poncho-sized blue plaid uniform skirt. Rory asks if Lorelai actually did do the principle, to which her mother confirms that it was a joke.

The two Gilmore girls leave the room and Sookie continues to celebrate on her own, showing that shes personally invested in Rorys schooling and general welfare.

She starts a fire, but a cook puts it out with the blandness of Mrs. Kims biscuits.

**Key Concepts:**

Rorys going to Chilton.

Rory wants to go to Harvard.

Sookie loves Rory as a person, not just Lorelais kid.

**(Mini-)Scene 7:***-In the Independence Inn-*Lorelai forces Michel to answer phones through a thinly veiled threat and opens a letter.

**(Mini-)Scene 8:** \-*Lorelais house*\- Lorelai is on the phone talking to Chilton, worried about the tuition. Shell figure out how to pay in within the next 4 days (before Monday).

**Key Concepts:**

*Setting: Lorelais house*

Lorelai and Sookie are drinking wine on the porch and discussing the tuition issue. Sookie offers to give anything she has, but she doesnt have enough and they both know it.

Sookie then starts to suggest this mysterious option and Lorelai very dramatically and Gilmore-esque says that she will not ask *those people* for help.

Rory enters and they are distracted by how she looks in her over-modest skirt. The two women usher her inside and the Gilmore girls start to talk. Rory participated in gym for the first time (sucking at it, just like mom!) because she was so excited that she was going to be going to Chilton. Sookie leaves and goes to get food to make in celebration while Lorelai kneels to pin up Rorys skirt.

When Rory leaves the room to look in the mirror, Lorelai looks at all her family pictures and realizes that she has to use her nuclear option.

**Key Concepts:**

Rory is *super*excited for Chilton

Rory wants to wear her uniform

Rory sucks at gym. Lorelai too.

**Scene 10:**

*Setting: Gilmore family home*

Lorelai is sat morosely on the footrest of her car, hiding from her parents house and drinking coffee. Shes convincing herself to go in.

Emily ends up answering the door, surprised to see her daughter.Is it Easter already? Lorelais excuse for being in town is that she has a business class in the area and wanted to stop by. Its clear Emily doesnt believe her.

Lorelai tries to make small talk, but Emily only responds with a word or two each time, shutting it down effectively. This then turns into a horribly awkward silence. That ends when Emily asks about Lorelais business class. Whats notable about this is that Emily is actually showing interest in her daughter's life. It seemed as though she was not happy to see Lorelai, but she is now seemingly unhappy with small talk. Id imagine its because she gets to see her daughter so rarely that she doesnt want to waste the valuable time on something that doesnt matter. Its not as if Lorelai is going to stop by every time she has this business class. Apparently, its twice a week and this is the first time she has come around.

Richard comes in next, involved in a newspaper. He sees Lorelai and saysIs it Christmas already? seemingly more sardonically than his wife.

He seems to either not believe that Lorelai is taking a business class or is miffed about something else. Possibly that she did not take advantage of her connection to him in terms of the business world. Lorelai says she has something to talk about with her parents, only to be interrupted by her father who states point-blank that shes going to ask for money.

Lorelai continues again to say that Rory was accepted into Chilton, which makes both grandparents happy, and that the tuition is very steep. Her father interrupts again to say that she needs money. Laura lie agrees, though she does excuse it as for Rory and not for her, as though her parents would not want to help her out. She also insists that it will all be paid back. Richard nods and goes to get his checkbook. Before he takes more than a step, Emily stops him. She has a condition.

&gt;E: Since we are now financially involved in your life, I want to be actively involved in your life.

Emily wants a weekly dinner with Rory and Lorelai at the Gilmore house on Fridays. They also want a weekly phone call so that they can have an update with their daughter and granddaughters life. Lorelai doesnt want Rory to know money is the motive, Emily agrees to that adjustment. Dinner is on.

Lorelai glances at a portrait of her parents and herself as a child, the grim faces all looking relatively unhappy. While it does immediately look as though they were never a happy family, it does mean that her parents love her. They have the means to take it down and replace it with something happy, and its not a holiday or a party. If it was about appearances, theyd put it up when something important happened. This is a Thursday afternoon. They have it up because they love their daughter.

**Key Concepts:**  
Rory and Lorelai almost never see Richard and Emily

The elder Gilmores (more specifically, Emily) yearn to see their daughter and granddaughter.

Lorelai thinks her parents dont love her

Lorelai associates her childhood with unhappiness

**Scene 11:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow High- hallway*

Character introduction(s): Dean

Rory is emptying her locker and explaining to Lane whats so good about Chilton. Chilton kids wont judge based on stupid stuff like clothes, theyre too smart for that. After teasing her, Lane leaves to go on her arranged date with the future Korean doctor.

&gt;L: How do I look? Korean?

Rory has her arms full and drops a book. Setting her box down and picking the book up, shes scared by a tall pair of legs. She makes a sarcastic comment and is met with an unexpected reference recognition.

Deans meet-cute has begun!

He understood her Rosemarys Baby reference and compliments her taste. He asks if shes moving away and says that he just got to town from Chicago. Dean introduces himself and is then met with awkward rambling.

What we do get out of this is Rorys full name:

&gt;R: Hi. Oh, Rory. Me. Thats-thats me. Well Lorelai.  
D: I like that.  
R: Its my mothers name, too. She named me after herself. She was lying in the hospital thinking about how men name boys after themselves all the time, you know? So why couldnt women? She says her feminism just kind of took over. Though, personally, I think a lot of Demerol went into that decision.

She then advises Dean to go see Miss Patty, the dance teacher, because she knows about jobs he can apply for. Dean asks her to show him where the dance studio is and when she agrees he picks up her box for her.

One thing to say about this is that Dean is *so*into her. Hes already said she has good taste twice in one conversation. Smitten.

Cue[**Waltz #01**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliAQ8wNrj0)(Youre welcome for the link lol)

*Setting: Stars Hollow*

They walk through town and Dean starts to ask her about herself. We two important things very quickly. 1. Rory was born in Hartford. 2. Its only 30 minutes away with traffic. This begs the question: Why does Rory NEVER see her grandparents? Did she live with them at some point? As someone with a very young set of parents, bite-sized me lived with my grandparents so that my parents could have a baby-raising tutorial for a bit.

Dean then asks if Rory likes reading Moby Dick and she gives a generally positive answer before realizing she never told him what she was reading.  


&gt;R: How did you know I was reading Moby Dick?  
D: Ive been watching you  
R: Watching me?  
D: I mean, not in a creepy, like, Im watching you sort of way. I just, Ive noticed you.  
R: Me?  
D: Yeah  
R: When?  
D: Every day. -pause- After school you come out and sit under that tree there and you read. Last week it was Madame Bovary, this week its Moby Dick.  
R: But why would you--   
D: Because youre nice to look at. And because youve got unbelievable concentration.  
R: What?  
D: Last Friday these two guys were tossing around a ball and one guy nailed the other right in the face. I mean it was a mess, blood everywhere, the nurse came out, the place was in chaos. His girlfriend was all freaking out and you just sat there and read. I mean, you never even looked up. I thought, Ive never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life. I have to meet that girl.  
R: Maybe I just didnt look up because I am unbelievably self-centered.  
D: Maybe, but I doubt it.  
R: -pause- So, did I ask you if you like cake?  
D: Yeah, you did.  
R: Oh, cause they have really good cake back there.

[**Waltz #01**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliAQ8wNrj0) 

**Key Concepts:**

That boy from before (Scene 3) was important! Who coulda guessed it?

Dean is new to town and from Chicago.

Dean likes Rory a lot.

Rory is not good at boys.

Rory is named after Lorelai.

Not many people get Rory's references.

Miss Patty knows everything.

Rory was born in Hartford, which is 30 minutes away with traffic.

Rory loves reading.

Rory is good at tuning everything out.

Dean's known about her longer than she's known about him.

Stars Hollow has really good round cakes.

**Scene 12:**

*Setting: Lukes Diner*

This is the first time we get a really good look at the Williams Hardware Store sign out front.

Rory and Lorelai are picking at their salads, Lorelai obviously struggling to get what she wants to say out of her mouth. She manages to slide the Friday Night Dinner at the grandparents house into the conversation, but Rory hooks onto it because shes confused. At first, she thinks theres a forgotten September holiday. Rory sees her mothers irritability and she lets it go.

Luke comes around, drops two burgers, and grumpily saysRed meat can kill you. Enjoy.

*Swoon.*

Lorelai says that she finished Rorys skirt and is surprised by the lack of excitement. Whereas Rory dropped the subject when her mother was irritated, Lorelai pursues it.

&gt;L: Hey, I had dibs on being the bitch tonight.  
R: Just tonight?  
L: What the hell is wrong with you?

This leads Rory to say that she doesnt want to move schools for these reasons:

1. The timing is bad
2. The bus ride sucks
3. Their financial situation

This revelation frustrates Lorelai because of the deal with her parents and because of the duos academic plan for Rory. What about Harvard? She gets mad and leaves (after being reminded to pay).

**Key Concepts:**

The normal mother-daughter relationship is still there. Rory recognizes that she doesnt need to know everything her mom does, Lorelai doesnt see this because she feels she has a right to know whats going on with Rory. More normal than their relationship

**Scene 13:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow*

They pass Lane on her awkward hayride date while walking home. Shes super bored.

Then they pass by Miss Pattys dance class and Miss Patty tells Rory that shes found her male friend a job. Lorelai doesnt know this friend and asks for clarification. Patty says hes cute and that Rory has good taste. She could probably see right through Rorys crush. Anyone could.

Rory starts to walk away, embarrassed. Her mother follows closely behind because she has realized that Dean is the reason Rory doesnt want to change schools like they planned.

*Setting: Lorelais house*

Once they get into the house they start arguing about Rory not wanting to change schools because of a guy. Lorelai accuses Rory of being like a younger version of herself. Lorelai made bad decisions that affected her ability to achieve certain things and doesnt want Rory to make the same mistake. She has more potential than her mother.She is intensely scared of Rory following in her footsteps.

Lorelai describes the guy she thinks Rory is probably into, it ends up actually sounding like Dean (... and a maybe possible later guy that Im super excited to talk about but cant ://////////). This just means that they probably share a taste in dudes. Another similarity.

&gt;L: Dark hair, romantic guy, looks a little dangerous. Does he have a motorcycle? If youre going to throw your life away, hed better have a motorcycle.

Rory shuts her door in her mothers face. Lorelai takes a deep breath and pursues her. She takes the time to say that she will be calm if Rory just tells her about the guy. Rory is too upset at this point and turns over in her bed so that she doesnt have to talk to her mother or listen to her attempt to reach out.

Lorelai is hurt by this, but she still has something to say.

&gt;L: You know, weve always had a democracy in this house. We never did anything unless we both agreed. But now I guess Im going to have to play the mom card. You are going to Chilton whether you want to or not. Monday morning, you will be there, end of story.

The door is slammed and both of them individually play the same CD to calm themselves, again showing how similar they are.

**Key Concepts:**

Lane's date sucked just as bad as we thought it would. Again shows the difference between her and her mom.

Miss Patty knows Rory likes Dean (and vice versa, who are we kidding?).

Rory wants to pursue Dean.

Lorelai and Rory have a similar taste in men.

Lorelai can put her foot down when she needs to. This scene always struck me because this is the first time that Lorelai really shows that shes the boss. It breaks the idea of the friend &gt; mother relationship that she wants to have with Rory.

**(Mini-) Scene 14:** *-At the Independence Inn-* Sookie made something explode and killed an expensive stove. Lorelai talks about how the argument between her and Rory was weird. Rory is still upset, but it seems Lorelai thought she would be back to normal by now. Michel and Sookie have a love-hate relationship.

**Scene 15:**

*Setting: Gilmore family home.*

Rory and Lorelai decide to band together outside of the house so that they survive the meal.

Inside, Emily is very excited to have Lorelai and Rory. Again, she answers the door. She takes Rory into the sitting room and asks about her school.

Lorelai disobeys her mother and throws her coffee out where she is told not to.

Richard sees Rory and comments that she is tall, surprised by the growth because he rarely sees her. The Gilmore girls are offered champagne to celebrate their reuniting as a family and the admission to Chilton.

Lorelai attempts to make a joke and it doesnt work out well, leading to Emily and Lorelai drinking simultaneously from their champagne. It shows that they are more alike than they want to seem.

Richard offers Rory a newspaper so that they can both ignore the awkwardness. This implies both that Rory is like her grandfather and that Richard is disinterested in a conflict between his wife and daughter.

We find out at dinner that Richard is generally disinterested in his job, he works in insurance. Emily knows more particulars of her daughters life, that Lorelai runs an in and not a motel, than Richard. Richard is also tactless, talking about Rorys father and how well hes doing compared to Lorelai.

Lorelai, hurt by a comment, escapes into the kitchen and start washing dishes to calm herself. This confuses the maid. Emily then goes to retrieve her from the kitchen instead of Rory. This is where they have an argument

The argument can be heard in the dining room where Rory and Richard are silent.

According to Emily, Lorelai and Christopher had bright futures before Lorelai got pregnant and Lorelai says that by not getting married they kept their bright futures. Emily disagrees, they shouldve gotten married. Emily says that Lorelai would have been taken care of because Christopher would have been in the insurance business with her father. Lorelai knows Christopher didnt want that and that she has a lovely life now. Emily points out that this life is too far away from the house she grew up in.

&gt;L: Oh, here we go.  
E: You took that girl completely and shut us out of your life.  
L: You wanted to control me.  
E: You were still a child.  
L: I stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink, okay? I had to figure out how to live, I found a good job--  
E: As a maid! With all your brains and talent...  
L: I worked my way up! I run the place now. I built a life on my own with no help from anyone.  
E: Yes, and think where youd be if you had accepted a little help. And where Rory wouldve been? But no, you were too proud to accept anything from anyone.  
L: Well, I wasnt too proud to come to you to beg for money for my kid's school, was I?  
E: No, you certainly werent. But youre proud too proud to tell her where you got it from, arent you? Well, fine. You have your precious pride and I have my weekly dinners. Isnt that nice? We both win.

Rory has heard all of this, immediately forgiving her mother. Richard has fallen asleep.

**Key Concepts:**

Emily loves Rory.

Rory can drink champagne at 16.

Lorelai disobeys her mother whenever possible, as evidenced by the coffee.

Lorelai and Emily have similar tendencies.

Richard and Rory are similar. Richard works in insurance.

Rory's dad is named Christopher.

Christopher is doing well for himself across the country.

Richard needs more emotional intelligence.

Emily wanted Lorelai and Christopher to marry. Her thought process is that while the kids wouldn't have been happy, Lorelai would be safe and well cared for. She wanted to take care of her daughter the way she was taught was the best.

Rory used to live with her grandparents.

Lorelai used to be a maid at the Independence Inn.

Rory knows how hard it is for Lorelai to ask her parents for help.

**Scene 16:**

*Setting: Lukes Diner*

At Lukes diner, Rory admits she heard everything. She also says shell go to Chilton.

Luke walks up to the table and a nice shirt and Lorelai is struck by the site. He seems incredibly pleased but is trying to hide it. He also compliments her. As soon as she asks for a coffee, hes back to his usual grumpy self. Hes irritated by their unhealthy food choices.

Rory briefly deflects questions about Dean before Luke returns with their food. He begs Rory to put the coffee down so that she doesnt turn out like her mother. Rory closes the show with sorry too late.

Super cheesy, super cute.

Luke and Lorelai share a look.

The rest of the lines are Lorelai badgering Rory for Dean-details. Nothing of substance.

Music overtakes it.

Darkness.

**Key Concepts:**

Chilton is happening.

Luke cares about Rory.

Lorelai is interested in Luke.

Luke is clearly interested in Lorelai.

Characters(in order of appearance):

Lorelai

Luke

Rory

Michel

Sookie

**Discussion welcome! Please comment whatever comes to mind, I'd love to talk about this show :)** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene one:**

*Setting: Lukes diner.*

Character introduction(s): Lorelai and Luke, Rory.

Lorelai and Luke are introduced together, something I very much appreciate. From the opening shot, you understand that the story at least partially follows Lorelai, but the fact that he has a name implies that he is at least some sort of important to the show.

Their banter characterizes Luke nicely here. He cares more about personal health than sales. Most business owners wouldnt care, but hes telling her she buys too much coffee from him. You see him pouring other patrons coffee, however. It shows that this is Lorelai-specific. There could be an argument that shes the only one that comes in that often, but because shes the main character I assume it is something Luke only bothers to say to Lorelai.

The way Rory is introduced is by highlighting the way that her personality contrasts her mothers. She asks for lipgloss and when presented with candy flavors she asks for something more neutral. Lorelai doesnt have anything simple, instead presenting unflavored but mood-reflecting lip gloss that Rory accepts along with a CD that her mother stole.

Lorelai and Luke have another small moment together when Lorelai asks for coffee for Rory, receiving a disapproving or skeptical look- I cant decide which.

While they do look incredibly similar, this scene provides fundamental character differences before continuing to say that they are nearly the same person for the rest of the episode. Despite these differences, it does end with the two of them scaring off a set of college boys that were interested in the pair of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**THEME SONG!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 2:**

*Setting: Independence Inn- front desk.*

Character introduction(s): Michel, Drella.

Michels introduction shows him to be grumpy and generally sarcastic, though he does know what hes talking about. His constant refrain of Im sorry, were completely booked shows that the inn is actually very popular for the next few weeks, not just at the moment.

Drella then enters and is rude to clients while she moves her towering harp. Lorelai attempts to reprimand her for speaking to guests this way, showing the audience that shes the boss. However, this attempt is unsuccessful, showing that Drella is obstinate.

Michel, now off the phone, gives Lorelai the phone so that she might call back an inefficient plumber and within two minutes Lorelai has made sure that the inn will not be charged and the plumber will fix what he was supposed to fix before.

When Rory shows up and asks for stamps Michel says no, but Lorelai overrides him. This again proves that Lorelai is the boss. Lorelai also teases her daughter for dressing too conservatively, something that proves their relationship to be different than most.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 3:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow- high school.*

Character introduction(s): Lane.

Lane and Rory are walking to school, talking about how Lanes parents are incredibly strict. Lane talks about how they disagree on music and even American portion sizes. When Lane changes her shirt it is made clear that Lane not only disagrees but secretly rebels against her parents.

It is said that Lane has to go on an arranged date with a Korean boy that will be a doctor someday.

While talking, Lane and Rory pass an unknown boy. Hes clearly interested in what theyre saying.

Hell be important.

&amp;#x200B;

**(Mini-)Scene 4:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow High- classroom.*

In class, Rory focuses on work while girls around her pass nail polish and gossip about her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 5:**

*Setting: Independence Inn- front desk.*

Character introduction(s): Sookie

Drella is playing the harp for an older woman and stops to introduce a tacky tin can for a tip jar. Lorelai cannot take care of this because she is distracted by a crash from the kitchens.

*Setting: Independence Inn- kitchen.*

Sookie, the cook, has fallen down. Its apparently a common occurrence. The two other cooks are scolded for letting her hurt herself, implying that it is even more common than previously caught.

Surrounded by pots and pans on the floor, Lorelai tries to scold Sookie but is interrupted by Sookies tasting spoon. This changes topics to how Sookie and Lorelai are planning on eventually opening their own inn and solidifies Sookie as Lorelais best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 6:**

*Setting: Kims Antiques*

Character introduction(s): Mrs. Kim

Rory and Lane enter Lanes home/her familys store, Lane now wearing Kim-appropriate clothing.

They have to shout to find Kim, a comedic bit of Marco Polo taking place while they wander the stacks. This is mostly unaided by Mrs. Kim, who seems to think thatnext to the table is any sort of help in a disorganized furniture store. While I do find it funny, it also characterizes Mrs. Kim oddly. Someone who gives such an unhelpful suggestion seems to make her either dumb or self-centered. She doesnt seem to be unintelligent, so it only seems that the latter is possible as theres no way Lane would be able to understand what she means. The fact that she tends tonot trust unmarried women is also a general point against her likability upon first meeting. She hates Lorelai and theres really no reason.

Once they meet in the kitchen, Lane is told to go to her room for tea (probably without sugar) and a bland rock hard biscuit. She then asks if anyones gotten pregnant and dropped out, leading Rory to respond with a joke-confirmation. Its an r/wooosh moment if youve ever seen one. Then Mrs. Kim says thatboys dont like funny girls. What a peach.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 7**:

*Setting: Independence Inn, kitchen*

This starts out as a choreographed example of how tornado-like Sookie is. Shes honestly a hazard to her own health to the point where youd want to baby proof her entire house. Only NERF knives without adult supervision.

Lorelai enters and scares Sookie, causing her to knock a cook to the ground with a heavy metal frying pan (big oof), though he bounces back like one of those punching bag balloon clowns. Maybe hes used to the concussions.

Either way, Lorelai announces that Rory was accepted into Chilton! Celebration! She didnt even have to do the principle. This is the first time that Rorys life plan is laid out for us, detailing Harvard as goal #1. Rory has always wanted to go to Harvard.

Rory enters the kitchen, looking for her mother, and is surprised to find her giggling with Sookie.

&gt;R: Did you do something slutty?  
&gt;  
&gt;L:Im not that happy.

Sookie ends up blowing the surprise by shouting it out and Lorelai hands over the poncho-sized blue plaid uniform skirt. Rory asks if Lorelai actually did do the principle, to which her mother confirms that it was a joke.

The two Gilmore girls leave the room and Sookie continues to celebrate on her own, showing that shes personally invested in Rorys schooling and general welfare.

She starts a fire, but a cook puts it out with the blandness of Mrs. Kims biscuits.

&amp;#x200B;

**(Mini-)Scene 8:***-In the Independence Inn-*Lorelai forces Michel to answer phones through a thinly veiled threat and opens a letter.

&amp;#x200B;

**(Mini-)Scene 9:** \-*Lorelais house*\- Lorelai is on the phone talking to Chilton, worried about the tuition. Shell figure out how to pay in within the next 4 days (before Monday).

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 10:**

*Setting: Lorelais house*

Lorelai and Sookie are drinking wine on the porch and discussing the tuition issue. Sookie offers to give anything she has, but she doesnt have enough and they both know it.

Sookie then starts to suggest this mysterious option and Lorelai very dramatically and Gilmore-esque says that she will not ask *those people* for help.

Rory enters and they are distracted by how she looks in her over-modest skirt. The two women usher her inside and the Gilmore girls start to talk. Rory participated in gym for the first time (sucking at it, just like mom!) because she was so excited that she was going to be going to Chilton. Sookie leaves and goes to get food to make in celebration while Lorelai kneels to pin up Rorys skirt.

When Rory leaves the room to look in the mirror, Lorelai looks at all her family pictures and realizes that she has to use her nuclear option.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 11:**

*Setting: Gilmore family home*

Lorelai is sat morosely on the footrest of her car, hiding from her parents house and drinking coffee. Shes convincing herself to go in.

Emily ends up answering the door, surprised to see her daughter.Is it Easter already? Lorelais excuse for being in town is that she has a business class in the area and wanted to stop by. Its clear Emily doesnt believe her.

Lorelai tries to make small talk, but Emily only responds with a word or two each time, shutting it down effectively. This then turns into a horribly awkward silence. That ends when Emily asks about Lorelais business class. Whats notable about this is that Emily is actually showing interest in her daughter's life. It seemed as though she was not happy to see Lorelai, but she is now seemingly unhappy with small talk. Id imagine its because she gets to see her daughter so rarely that she doesnt want to waste the valuable time on something that doesnt matter. Its not as if Lorelai is going to stop by every time she has this business class. Apparently, its twice a week and this is the first time she has come around.

Richard comes in next, involved in a newspaper. He sees Lorelai and saysIs it Christmas already? seemingly more sardonically than his wife.

He seems to either not believe that Lorelai is taking a business class or is miffed about something else. Possibly that she did not take advantage of her connection to him in terms of the business world. Lorelai says she has something to talk about with her parents, only to be interrupted by her father who states point-blank that shes going to ask for money.

Lorelai continues again to say that Rory was accepted into Chilton, which makes both grandparents happy, and that the tuition is very steep. Her father interrupts again to say that she needs money. Laura lie agrees, though she does excuse it as for Rory and not for her, as though her parents would not want to help her out. She also insists that it will all be paid back. Richard nods and goes to get his checkbook. Before he takes more than a step, Emily stops him. She has a condition.

&gt;E: Since we are now financially involved in your life, I want to be actively involved in your life.

Emily wants a weekly dinner with Rory and Lorelai at the Gilmore house on Fridays. They also want a weekly phone call so that they can have an update with their daughter and granddaughters life. Lorelai doesnt want Rory to know money is the motive, Emily agrees to that adjustment. Dinner is on.

Lorelai glances at a portrait of her parents and herself as a child, the grim faces all looking relatively unhappy. While it does immediately look as though they were never a happy family, it does mean that her parents love her. They have the means to take it down and replace it with something happy, and its not a holiday or a party. If it was about appearances, theyd put it up when something important happened. This is a Thursday afternoon. They have it up because they love their daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 12:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow High- hallway*

Character introduction(s): Dean

Rory is emptying her locker and explaining to Lane whats so good about Chilton. Chilton kids wont judge based on stupid stuff like clothes, theyre too smart for that. After teasing her, Lane leaves to go on her arranged date with the future Korean doctor.

&gt;L: How do I look? Korean?

Rory has her arms full and drops a book. Setting her box down and picking the book up, shes scared by a tall pair of legs. She makes a sarcastic comment and is met with an unexpected reference recognition.

Deans meet-cute has begun!

He understood her Rosemarys Baby reference and compliments her taste. He asks if shes moving away and says that he just got to town from Chicago. Dean introduces himself and is then met with awkward rambling.

What we do get out of this is Rorys full name:

&gt;R: Hi. Oh, Rory. Me. Thats-thats me. Well Lorelai.  
&gt;  
&gt;D: I like that.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Its my mothers name, too. She named me after herself. She was lying in the hospital thinking about how men name boys after themselves all the time, you know? So why couldnt women? She says her feminism just kind of took over. Though, personally, I think a lot of Demerol went into that decision.

She then advises Dean to go see Miss Patty, the dance teacher, because she knows about jobs he can apply for. Dean asks her to show him where the dance studio is and when she agrees he picks up her box for her.

One thing to say about this is that Dean is *so*into her. Hes already said she has good taste twice in one conversation. Smitten.

Cue[**Waltz #01**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliAQ8wNrj0)(So nostalgic...)

*Setting: Stars Hollow*

They walk through town and Dean starts to ask her about herself. We two important things very quickly. 1. Rory was born in Hartford. 2. Its only 30 minutes away with traffic. This begs the question: Why does Rory NEVER see her grandparents? Did she live with them at some point? As someone with a very young set of parents, bite-sized me lived with my grandparents so that my parents could have a baby-raising tutorial for a bit.

Dean then asks if Rory likes reading Moby Dick and she gives a generally positive answer before realizing she never told him what she was reading.

&gt;R: How did you know I was reading Moby Dick?  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Ive been watching you.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Watching me?  
&gt;  
&gt;D: I mean, not in a creepy, like, Im watching you sort of way. I just, Ive noticed you.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Me?  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Yeah  
&gt;  
&gt;R: When?  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Every day. -pause- After school you come out and sit under that tree there and you read. Last week it was Madame Bovary, this week its Moby Dick.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: But why would you--  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Because youre nice to look at. And because youve got unbelievable concentration.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: What?  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Last Friday these two guys were tossing around a ball and one guy nailed the other right in the face. I mean it was a mess, blood everywhere, the nurse came out, the place was in chaos. His girlfriend was all freaking out and you just sat there and read. I mean, you never even looked up. I thought, Ive never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life. I have to meet that girl.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Maybe I just didnt look up because I am unbelievably self-centered.  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Maybe, but I doubt it.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: *-pause-* So, did I ask you if you like cake?  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Yeah, you did.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Oh, cause they have really good cake back there.

[**Waltz #01**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aliAQ8wNrj0)

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 13:**

*Setting: Lukes Diner*

This is the first time we get a really good look at the Williams Hardware Store sign out front.

Rory and Lorelai are picking at their salads, Lorelai obviously struggling to get what she wants to say out of her mouth. She manages to slide the Friday Night Dinner at the grandparents house into the conversation, but Rory hooks onto it because shes confused. At first, she thinks theres a forgotten September holiday. Rory sees her mothers irritability and she lets it go.

Luke comes around, drops two burgers, and grumpily saysRed meat can kill you. Enjoy.

*Swoon.*

Lorelai says that she finished Rorys skirt and is surprised by the lack of excitement. Whereas Rory dropped the subject when her mother was irritated, Lorelai pursues it.

&gt;L: Hey, I had dibs on being the bitch tonight.R: Just tonight?L: What the hell is wrong with you?

This leads Rory to say that she doesnt want to move schools for these reasons:

1. The timing is bad
2. The bus ride sucks
3. Their financial situation

This revelation frustrates Lorelai because of the deal with her parents and because of the duos academic plan for Rory. What about Harvard? She gets mad and leaves (after being reminded to pay).

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 14:**

*Setting: Stars Hollow*

They pass Lane on her awkward hayride date while walking home. Shes super bored.

Then they pass by Miss Pattys dance class and Miss Patty tells Rory that shes found her male friend a job. Lorelai doesnt know this friend and asks for clarification. Patty says hes cute and that Rory has good taste. She could probably see right through Rorys crush. Anyone could.

Rory starts to walk away, embarrassed. Her mother follows closely behind because she has realized that Dean is the reason Rory doesnt want to change schools like they planned.

*Setting: Lorelais house*

Once they get into the house they start arguing about Rory not wanting to change schools because of a guy. Lorelai accuses Rory of being like a younger version of herself. Lorelai made bad decisions that affected her ability to achieve certain things and doesnt want Rory to make the same mistake. She has more potential than her mother.She is intensely scared of Rory following in her footsteps.

Lorelai describes the guy she thinks Rory is probably into, it ends up actually sounding like Dean (... and a maybe possible later guy that Im super excited to talk about but cant ://////////). This just means that they probably share a taste in dudes. Another similarity.

&gt;L: Dark hair, romantic guy, looks a little dangerous. Does he have a motorcycle? If youre going to throw your life away, hed better have a motorcycle.

Rory shuts her door in her mothers face. Lorelai takes a deep breath and pursues her. She takes the time to say that she will be calm if Rory just tells her about the guy. Rory is too upset at this point and turns over in her bed so that she doesnt have to talk to her mother or listen to her attempt to reach out.

Lorelai is hurt by this, but she still has something to say.

&gt;L: You know, weve always had a democracy in this house. We never did anything unless we both agreed. But now I guess Im going to have to play the mom card. You are going to Chilton whether you want to or not. Monday morning, you will be there, end of story.

The door is slammed and both of them individually play the same CD to calm themselves, again showing how similar they are.

&amp;#x200B;

**(Mini-) Scene 15:** *-At the Independence Inn-* Sookie made something explode and killed an expensive stove. Lorelai talks about how the argument between her and Rory was weird. Rory is still upset, but it seems Lorelai thought she would be back to normal by now. Michel and Sookie have a love-hate relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 16:**

*Setting: Gilmore family home.*

Rory and Lorelai decide to band together outside of the house so that they survive the meal.

Inside, Emily is very excited to have Lorelai and Rory. Again, she answers the door. She takes Rory into the sitting room and asks about her school.

Lorelai disobeys her mother and throws her coffee out where she is told not to.

Richard sees Rory and comments that she is tall, surprised by the growth because he rarely sees her. The Gilmore girls are offered champagne to celebrate their reuniting as a family and the admission to Chilton.

Lorelai attempts to make a joke and it doesnt work out well, leading to Emily and Lorelai drinking simultaneously from their champagne. It shows that they are more alike than they want to seem.

Richard offers Rory a newspaper so that they can both ignore the awkwardness. This implies both that Rory is like her grandfather and that Richard is disinterested in a conflict between his wife and daughter.

We find out at dinner that Richard is generally disinterested in his job, he works in insurance. Emily knows more particulars of her daughters life, that Lorelai runs an in and not a motel, than Richard. Richard is also tactless, talking about Rorys father and how well hes doing compared to Lorelai.

Lorelai, hurt by a comment, escapes into the kitchen and start washing dishes to calm herself. This confuses the maid. Emily then goes to retrieve her from the kitchen instead of Rory. This is where they have an argument

The argument can be heard in the dining room where Rory and Richard are silent.

According to Emily, Lorelai and Christopher had bright futures before Lorelai got pregnant and Lorelai says that by not getting married they kept their bright futures. Emily disagrees, they shouldve gotten married. Emily says that Lorelai would have been taken care of because Christopher would have been in the insurance business with her father. Lorelai knows Christopher didnt want that and that she has a lovely life now. Emily points out that this life is too far away from the house she grew up in.

&gt;L: Oh, here we go.  
&gt;  
&gt;E: You took that girl completely and shut us out of your life.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: You wanted to control me.  
&gt;  
&gt;E: You were still a child.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: I stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink, okay? I had to figure out how to live, I found a good job--  
&gt;  
&gt;E: As a maid! With all your brains and talent...  
&gt;  
&gt;L: I worked my way up! I run the place now. I built a life on my own with no help from anyone.  
&gt;  
&gt;E: Yes, and think where youd be if you had accepted a little help. And where Rory wouldve been? But no, you were too proud to accept anything from anyone.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: Well, I wasnt too proud to come to you to beg for money for my kid's school, was I?  
&gt;  
&gt;E: No, you certainly werent. But youre proud too proud to tell her where you got it from, arent you? Well, fine. You have your precious pride and I have my weekly dinners. Isnt that nice? We both win.

Rory has heard all of this, immediately forgiving her mother. Richard has fallen asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 17:**

*Setting: Lukes Diner*

At Lukes diner, Rory admits she heard everything. She also says shell go to Chilton.

Luke walks up to the table and a nice shirt and Lorelai is struck by the site. He seems incredibly pleased but is trying to hide it. He also compliments her. As soon as she asks for a coffee, hes back to his usual grumpy self. Hes irritated by their unhealthy food choices.

Rory briefly deflects questions about Dean before Luke returns with their food. He begs Rory to put the coffee down so that she doesnt turn out like her mother. Rory closes the show with sorry too late.

Super cheesy, super cute.

Luke and Lorelai share a look.

The rest of the lines are Lorelai badgering Rory for Dean-details. Nothing of substance.

Music overtakes it.

Darkness.

**My reaction:**

A really nice pilot. Establishes recurring themes and nicely sets up the entire show from here on out. An interesting fact is that Emily rarely is seen opening her door after this.

I'll most likely just post the rest of my reviews to my own page unless it's better post them here? I'd love to discuss every damn review if anyone's actually interested ;)

The night that Lorelai goes to friday night dinner and Emily and Richard are trying to set Chris up with the therapist she ends up in the back of the therapist car talking about Luke. When the therapist asks her is she loved Max she said no, then she goes on to say that the only man she has ever really loved has been Luke. From this I assume she never loved Chris in that way....

After this night she gives Luke the ultimatum, he turns her down, she sleeps with Chris and she doesn't really date him for too long before the entire Paris marriage happens.... that is a very short time to fall in love with someone. Especially someone you have known well for many years, I feel like at this point she either loves him that way or she doesn't.

So now my final conclusion is that she never loved him at all, which makes me feel really bad for Chris in that situation. (Even though overall I do not like Chris)

First, after having a baby, you need time to heal, because having a baby is a huge deal on a body. Having kids that close would mean giving birth, then getting pregnant within about 6 months, 3 times.  
Second, daycare/hiring a nanny for 4 kids under the age of 5, even in 2005, would cost SO MUCH money.

Despite being a couple of years my senior I have always been able to relate to Rory in many ways; the family rejection she experiences for being a road block in Lorelais life; the complex relationship with her absentee father; her application of humor, small talk, and facts to communicate; the pressures of school and family; even down to her complicated dating life and decisions; despite not always agreeing with Rory, I have been able to relate to her throughout my my teens. In many ways I have used Rory as an excuse to avoid reflection. 
Many years after GG I found myself in my Rory like quarter-life crisis, similar to Rory, uni was my catalyst. After watching A year in the life, I remember the resemblance between my current situation and the later seasons of GG. I have since rewatched all of GG and it has been as life changing now that Im 24 as it was when I was 12. 

I have always admired the relationship between Lorelai and Rory, being able to relate to Rory in many ways, it caused 12 year old me to resent the fact that i could not relate to Rory when it came to this. My comfort and friend throughout my teens might likely also be the source of many of the grudges and pains I hold towards my parents and childhood. If I could I would go back in time and sit by younger me as she watched GG for the very first time and help her see GG as I see it today. Alas, that I cannot do, however researching GG has finally freed me from the spell the Gilmores had casted on me. I no longer romanticize their relationship, instead I was able to pick up on the signs of disfunction (e.g. them not being able to talk about serious life matters, and their constant use of the ever so hated guilt trip). 

Similar to Rory, i have returned to uni and was send to see the school psychologist, but unlike  Rory I afterwards started seeing my own psychologist and working on solving my internal issues with my childhood, expectations and confidence. I am excited to see how my a year in the life will look like when I am 32, and I hope that tackling inner demons will help me become a more fulfilled person. 
I realize that the Lorelai Gilmores are fictional characters, but to 12yo me they were a fantasy life. I hope to be able to watch another year in the lives of the Gilmores. Im curious to see how Rory her life continues and if after all those years I would still be able to recognize bits of me in this character. I wonder if she, like we saw Lorelai do, will one day sit down and discuss what it was like growing carrying the pressure of her mother. Despite not being a huge fan of A year in the life I enjoyed having a real time update on the Gilmores and would love another peek many years from today. ",0,6,False,self,,,,,

She is no stranger to failure. She is no stranger to picking herself back up.   


She fails at Chilton. She works harder.   
She fails at the Yale Daily News. She accepts the criticism and changes. She works harder.   
She fails academically at Yale. She cries for a night, then moves on with life. Drops the course. She works harder.   


People seem to forget that Rory displays a lot of ""grit"" pre-dropping out of Yale. She is fully aware that she is not perfect. (Others aren't, but that's another post). She (generally) knows how to keep going, even when it's not easy.   


She receives a terrible review from a man. Yeah, it's just one guy-- but it's not just an Average Joe. It's the guy who owns half the newspapers on the east coast. The guy who is supposed to be the one who knows everything about everything. The single best contact she could have had in her intended field and whose bad review could kill job offers.   


I know a lot of people wonder why she didn't just work harder: But exactly how does one work harder when their criticism is ""You just don't have IT. I know it in my gut!"" There's not a lot you can do with such a generic, hopeless criticism. He does say she's not assertive enough, which she does come back and make up for later.   


Not to mention he's her boyfriend's dad. She's just been shit on by his entire family. She's raw and emotional.

She is no stranger to failure. She is no stranger to picking herself back up.

She fails at Chilton. She works harder.She fails at the Yale Daily News. She accepts the criticism and changes. She works harder.She fails academically at Yale. She cries for a night, then moves on with life. Drops the course. She works harder.

People seem to forget that Rory displays a lot of ""grit"" pre-dropping out of Yale. She is fully aware that she is not perfect. (Others aren't, but that's another post). She (generally) knows how to keep going, even when it's not easy.

She receives a terrible review from a man. Yeah, it's just one guy-- but it's not just an Average Joe. It's the guy who owns half the newspapers on the east coast. The guy who is supposed to be the one who knows everything about everything. The single best contact she could have had in her intended field and whose bad review could kill job offers.

I know a lot of people wonder why she didn't just work harder: But exactly how does one work harder when their criticism is ""You just don't have IT. I know it in my gut!"" There's not a lot you can do with such a generic, hopeless criticism. He does say she's not assertive enough, which she does come back and make up for later.

Not to mention he's her boyfriend's dad. She's just been shit on by his entire family. She's raw and emotional.

There's something about the last 3 episodes of season 3 which definitely have a different vibe.

The show is starting it's transition from what I would say is the cozy, young version of GG to the more mature version - with all of the characters really starting to develop and when Rory starts to get on people's nerves.

Now, back to the point. As many of us know, this episode was the backdoor pilot for ""Winward Circle"", so it absolutely has a different feel since ASP was setting up plot lines for that show.

&amp;#x200B;

However, what I realized today is that Lorelai &amp; Rory's plots in 3.21/3.22 really throwback to the pilot episode. A couple of instances that made me think of the pilot:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Lorelai's phone call with financial aid is very similar to the one she had with Chilton in the pilot, down to the 'I'll figure it out"" line.
2. Obviously, Rory setting up payment of tuition with her grandparents and not telling Lorelai is mirroring what Lorelai did for Rory in the pilot. They both agreed to dinners so the other person could do something they really wanted. I also noticed how in the Pilot, Emily is the one to add the condition of the dinners before Lorelai can get the money and  in 3.22 Richard is the one to add the condition of Rory not paying him back until after graduation.
3. The conversation between Lorelai and Paris about picking a school based on where her boyfriend is. Similar to how Rory and Lorelai fought about how Rory didn't want to go to Chilton because she liked Dean.
4. The scene in the pilot where Lorelai &amp; Sookie and talking about how Lorelai is going to pay for Chilton and Rory comes out in her Chilton skirt vs. the scene where Lorelai &amp; Sookie and adjusting Rory's graduation dress and tell her that they can't get the inn because Rory didn't get financial aid.

Ive started and stopped the series so many times but dont think I ever watched full through. The show makes me feel so cozy. 

I first encountered Gilmore Girls in high school (graduated 2007) when I was dating a girl who obsessed over the show with her two younger sisters. I dont remember watching it then on a week to week basis but definitely saw episodes and liked them. I definitely fell for Rory/Alexis. I for sure watched the finale live then with that family. 

Years later, another girlfriend had the complete box set. This was probably around 2010/11 and before Netflix had the series to stream. I definitely watched the show on my own then. However, I dont remember ever watching the last season and a half. Ran out of steam/graduated from college. 

Then in 2013 I started streaming the shows on Netflix and even blogged about them. Recapping the seasons and adding commentary. My last post was on December 1, 2013 about Season 5, Episodes 9-15. Not sure why I stopped. 

I totally marathon watched AYITL. I have many opinions on that but Im just trying to chronicle the OS attempts here. 

My mother moved in with me for a year while she was going through some financial stuff in 2017. I pitched the show to her as having the same coziness as Murder, She Wrote. At first she wasnt into it but then she liked it enough to ask me to watch it on random night ha. After she moved across country I stopped watching it. 

Now, on a whim, I started the pilot again on Sunday night. Probably watched 3-4 episodes. So good. Yesterday, I had to work from home due a series of events happening in my office. Instead of working I watched through episode 12. 

I completely forgot how stellar the show was from the get go. Its awkward and sincere. I never got the Rory is annoying vibe. She annoys me from time to time but as a whole I dont consider her annoying. I do love Loreleis weird 2000s fashionista looks. Theyre hilarious looking back.

To me Max gave off a creepy vibe from the moment he first interacted with Lorelai: He was obviously super into her when they first met at the parents night, and his comment about needing people like Rory at Chilton seemed to be more about getting on Lorelai's good side than Rory. Then he started to hit on her through calls about Rory\`s school work, asked her out at a Chilton event and ignored her rejection multiple times, which is not at all okay and even less so if you are in a position of power. And after they got together it did not get better: He used Rory to pass on messages to Lorelai and talked her out of breaking up with him in the most condescending way even though she had very legitimate reasons, just to break up with her for the very same reasons a little later.

I couldnt find any past threads about it.

Everyone on here says that Lorelai getting married to Christopher without Rory present is unrealistic and out-of-character, but I dont think it is. She was emotional then, still sad about her breakup with Luke yet excited to be in Paris and temporarily infatuated with Christopher. It makes sense that shed agree to elope, especially when she was on the verge of eloping with Luke at the end of the sixth season.

Yes, she was emotional then, too, and probably wouldnt have proposed the idea an hour ago  but if, in the moment, Luke had said yes, they would have driven off the Maryland and no married with just the two of them there and not Rory.  Maybe Lorelai wouldve later regretted having her wedding that way but she was ready to when she begged Luke to follow along with her plan. 

Id go as far to say that its more unrealistic that Lorelai would elope with Luke  and just the two of them there  rather than Christopher. When it comes to her other boyfriends, shes a little rash and impulsive. She doesnt feel the need to include Rory in as much. However, when it comes to Luke, shes very protective of the relationship and wants everything to be perfect  so I doubt shed get married without Rory there.

Im not really sure my point is clear. It just seems like a bunch of random thoughts. I was watching the scene where Lorelai begs Luke to elope with her and suddenly realized that had Luke said yes, they probably wouldve eloped. That made me realize that its actually far less realistic than Lorelai eloping with Christopher in Paris  besides the laws and regulations they managed to bypass, which I agree is pretty unrealistic and crazy.",4,8,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the clincher for me that makes me team Jess (vs team Logan) is when Rory interns at Mitchum's newspaper. In my mind, I'm admittedly pure Lorelai- I think the Huntzbergers have a gigantic drive to prevent Rory and Logan from being together. Mitchum knew to achieve this, instead of telling them upfront that Rory wasn't adequate (like Shira did), it would be easier to tear her down where she was vulnerable and he had the utmost strength (sorry tangent).

&amp;#x200B;

When Rory tells Lorelai that Logan agreed with Mitchum, that he called his dad a jerk but never said that he was wrong. She's right, how does that not strike Rory as messed up? Shouldn't boyfriends be there to be on your side? To bolster you up in the face of opposition? Where is the loyalty?! It has always bothered me that she continually sees him throughout her life, when he doesn't defend her in the face of a critic.

&amp;#x200B;

Jess has his faults, but he always bolstered her intellect. That's why he's her guy. Dean was a great first boyfriend, was loyal etc, but didn't challenge her. Logan had her type of status AND the intellect, but not her strong ally in the face of the world.  Jess, though didn't have status, was salt of the earth AND could keep her on her toes (nicely paralleling Luke and Lorelai). ",13,2,False,self,,,,,

She raised a healthy, smart, successful kid. But her immaturity and her arrested development led to parenting blunders I just can't forgive (excuse the dramatics).

Lorelai had a terrible time with the boundaries between Best Friend and Mom. I understand that she's able to be laid back so often because she doesn't have to worry about Rory, but when Rory does need some motherly guidance, she's absolutely terrible about it!

When Rory has second thoughts about going to Chilton, Lorelai pulls an Emily: ""This is what you wanted SO BAD, too bad you're sucking it up and going to that damn school."" Which is reasonable in some cases, but Lorelai can barely afford the tuition she hasn't paid for yet and claims to be the most open, understanding mother.

When Rory loses her virginity to Dean, she starts out firm and tells Rory the things she needs to hear, but Rory obviously doesn't react well. Instead of actually telling her daughter, who she KNOWS is incredibly naieve, the reality of what she's just done, Lorelai completely shuts down on Rory and practically tells her daughter to fuck on out of the country with Emily because she doesn't want to see her since she fucked up so bad. Yes, Rory is mad at Lorelai too but I'm of the opinion it's the mom's job to be the adult in those situations, not fight back with the same immaturity.

She does the same thing when Rory drops out of Yale. Rory made a perfectly reasonable argument to her mother: my world was kind of just shattered and I apparently need a new major, I have community service to deal with, I want to take a limited amount of time off from school to figure myself out.  Rory needs support from her mom and her so called best friend but Lorelai takes this as a personal offense and completely cuts Rory out, like they're two friends in high school fighting.

Now, is a mother required to accept every stupid decision their kid makes and walk them through it? Of course not, as nice as it would be for everyone to have understanding parents that's not reality. But it's Lorelai's hypocrisy that makes it even worse. The entire duration of the series, she's all ""Rory you're my best friend and my partner and crime, you can come to me for anything, you know that!"" But when Rory actually does? She completely freaks out and shuts down. Some kids are just naturally good, Rory had always been one of those kids and Lorelai actually had no idea how to parent.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

It doesn't justify it, but Lorelai's impulsive. I get it.

However, what I found most infuriating is how she treats Luke after she finally decides to make amends *weeks* after the fact. First, she approaches him and does her whole ""donut bit"" - I understand that she feels awkward and she's trying to restore their normal dynamic, but acting like nothing happened is not a good way to start. Then, when he's not as receptive as she'd like, she quickly turns defensive and says, ""So, this is how it's gonna be with us now, huh?"" and accuses him of acting cold towards her. Then after he denies it twice, she finally says the words, ""I'm sorry."" She says that it was bad night and vaguely mentions some ""things"" that she said, and asks him if he read her note. The note she wrote for him. The note in which she apologized like a ***million*** times, which, as Luke says, was only four times. Lorelai brushes him off and once again tells him that he's being really unfair because ""Rory was in the hospital"". 

To recap, she completely fails to sincerely admit that she made a mistake in the first place. She is defensive the entire time and acts entitled to his forgiveness - without even asking for it. She doesn't acknowledge the impact that her words had on him. Yes, she wrote him a note of apology, but if it wasn't anything like this, I'm not surprised Luke saw right through it and didn't want to make up. ",9,19,False,self,,,,,

Logan and Jess are more similar than different. They both have a problem with authority. Both are incredibly smart and great writers. Both have MAJOR mommy AND daddy issues. The only difference is that Jess figures it out first. 
Thats how hes able to write his book and move on. Logan is stuck on his familys prominence till he realizes thats whats holding him back. But at that point its too late. Rory has lost all respect. Or he becomes exactly what her subconscious is trying to avoid. 
Until the revival. Since shes years older, she wants someone to settle down with. But still needs someone to support her, believe in her. Logan tries, but who are we kidding?

Jess on the other provides her with a way out that she can make all her own. Very Gilmore. #teamjessforthewin

How has Paris never been punched in the goddamn face?

I know ""she was rich"", etc, but I've known plenty of very wealthy girls who were FAR better behaved than her and still caught five to the mouth once or twice for acting like that.  

Not only did she never get the (I feel) inevitable ass-kicking that would have taught her character to temper her drive with manners, but people tolerated and seemed to encourage it.  When she changed Rory's room with hers sophmore year of college because she wanted the bigger room, Rory just rolls with it.  Any real roommates would have been having a knock-down drag out in the common room.  I was genuinely hoping Janet would slap her across the face when she was acting like a psycho about Janet's boyfriend.

To be clear:

I love that Paris is strong, focused, driven, and assertive.  I do not like that she is allowed to act like her intensity makes it acceptable for her to be acerbically rude to everyone including bullying, talking down to them, and being blatantly disrespectful to everyone from the poor kid at school to a teacher she disagrees with at Yale.",15,24,False,self,,,,,

But Rory and Lorelai's enmeshment is really off-putting with each rewatch (I've been watching this show since maybe 2005?) 

As a teenager, I would've loved to have a closer relationship with my mother, in which I could share everything with her and pursue similar interests. I genuinely feel as though Lorelai views Rory as an extension of herself, and Rory does not know how to exist without her mother's influence and praise. Here are some examples:

* I think it's the first episode? Rory is reluctant about going to Chilton. Instead of talking to her daughter rationally and calmly about the importance of this opportunity, there is a screaming match in the street of SH. What bugged me most was when Lorelai told Rory, ""you're me!"" in regards to Rory prioritizing a guy. ....Excuse me? Rory is her own person, allowed to have her own thoughts and feelings. 
* In every single instance of Rory being told she is less than perfect and if she is even slightly criticized, Lorelai lashes out just has much as Rory does. I mean... in many episodes Lorelai literally refers to her as a ""perfect angel."" What kind of entitlement does that breed in a human, to be told over and over how exceptional they are?
   * This is actually pretty common throughout the show. Lorelai yells at Chilton teachers when she feels Rory is being disadvantaged, and completely spazzes out when Mitchum suggests that Rory ""doesn't have it,"" and is always there to pad Rory's ego in regards to her journalism efforts. Compliments are one thing, but I really see over and over abundant praise where praise just isn't due. 
   * Her reaction to Rory's car accident with Jess always horrifies me. For insurance purposes, it was immature and short-sighted of Rory to allow Jess to drive her car. She actively made that decision. When all the people in the town rally against Jess and give Rory the ""poor you"" treatment after the accident, Lorelai is the first to say, ""I get to hate this kid!"" and dismiss any of Rory's attempts to claim her own responsibility. 
      * On top of this... it was just a hairline fracture. Sleeping in your 17 your old kids' room for a minor arm-break? This was a completely an over-the-top and unnecessary reaction. Never mind calling Christopher to come comfort. 
* I HATE the line where Lorelai overheard Paris confiding in Rory about losing her virginity and Lorelai lurks around a corner saying, ""I've got the good kid."" Just.... ew. 
* When Rory can't spend the first night at Yale alone without her mother, I find that terribly strange and unrealistic. I think it's too codependent of an actin to be passed off as cute or quirky, and I am hesitant to believe that the other college freshman would be so excited to party with a stranger + her mother the first night of college (Source: I was a college freshman. We didn't deal with other people's parents when we didn't have to.)

The only exception I can think to any of this is season 5 Rory meltdown... Lorelai is the first to tell Rory that losing her virginity to Dean was not some wonderful and happy thing. (I cringe so hard when Rory says, ""But my Dean!"")

This is just one example. Im on season 4 of my current rewatch loop. In episode 2, Rory calls Lorelai back to Yale, freaking out about being without her mom. They have this exchange:

R: Its going to be very hard to be Christaine Amanpour broadcasting live from a foxhole in Tehran *with my mommy*. I guess youre just gonna have to learn how to operate a camera, because Ill need you there with me. 

L: I would do that.

Then Rory continues on with her rant, not acknowledging what her mother just said (this is NOT a Rory-hate post, I just mean to point out that the dialogue is written such that Lorelais line is insignificant). 

The way Lorelai says, I would do that, is so earnest, so sincere, that it really gets to me when I watch it now. Shes not trying to be quippy or funny, she is genuinely telling her daughter that she would do *anything* to make her feel safe. Before I became a mother I could sometimes judge their relationship as codependent and unhealthy, like others do. But now that Im a mom I completely get why Lorelai treats Rory like a princess. I dont really care if people say Im spoiling my kid or making him too dependent on me, theres nothing I wouldnt do to make him happy.

*Setting: Stars Hollow, Lukes Diner*

Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street together, discussing the fact that they need to do laundry later that day. Lorelai teases that she doesnt have any underwear on because she has none left and Rory rolls her eyes. A brief bit of banter leads to them to agree that Rory will do Lorelais laundry.

They pass Miss Patty, who is organizing a fall themed group of dancers.

They walk into Lukes diner only to find Taylor stalking Luke around the room and demanding he put up Thanksgiving decorations. Luke is against any type of Autumn-themed decorations.

&gt;Lorelai: Excuse me, can we get some coffee please?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: And a muffin?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Warmed?  
&gt;  
&gt;Taylor: This is the Autumn Festival. Your show is right across the street from the Horn of Plenty! You're right smack dab in the middle of everything. You have to decorate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: I don't have to do anything but serve food.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: And coffee!  
&gt;  
&gt;R: And muffins!  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: Taylor, I'm tired of having this conversation with you every year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Yoo-hoo!  
&gt;  
&gt;T: You have lived in Stars Hollow for a long time, young man. It's time you became one of us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Whoo! *\[she waves money\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: Sorry, I guess my pod's defective.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Hey. My mom's not wearing any underwear.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Oh!  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Well you aren't.

Taylor and Luke continue to argue, taking no notice of anything being said by the girls. So, Lorelai goes behind the counter and gets the aforementioned coffee and donuts... and isnt chased out.

&gt;Luke: Here, dont use your hands  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Taylor: I don't think you're taking me seriously.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: What gave you that idea? *\[to Lorelai, who is leaving\]* No tip?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Lorelai: Oh, yeah, here's a tip -- serve your customers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: Here's another -- don't sit on any cold benches.

&amp;#x200B;

## THEME SONG

&amp;#x200B;

**S2-**

*Setting: Stars Hollow, Dooses Market/Kims Antiques*

Rory gets off the bus from Hartford in her uniform and she walks into the grocery store, seemingly nervous. Immediately she sees Taylor and Dean stacking cans in a Mayflower shape for Thanksgiving.

In an effort to stalk the cute bag boy, Rory inconspicuously gives the cornstarch a very thorough reading. Dean and Rory make eye contact, smiling at each other. This prompts Dean to escape Taylors grasp and approach her.

&gt;Dean: You know, you can get two for three bucks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: Oh really? Excellent deal.  
&gt;  
&gt;D: You just had a desperate need for some cornstarch?  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Yes. I have very important thickening needs, thank you. Nice apron.  
&gt;  
&gt;D: Nice uniform.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Well, you know, I sewed the buttons on with silver thread so that sets me apart from the crowd.

Then Dean invites her to get a free pop (Soda. Its Soda, Dean) from the cooler. Dean holds two cans behind his back and asks Rory to choose one.

Before Rory can make a guess, Dean kisses her.

Shes so shocked by the fact that she was just kissed for the first time that she quietly says thank you before realizing how much of a dork that made her. Her face goes from thinking-too-fast-for-expressions to oh-god-i-think-ill-just-die-now.

Before either of them can say another word, Rorys gone from the store and Dean is standing alone, his shaggy-hot-90s-heart-throb haircut covering part of his confused face.

Outside, Rory sprints away from the store with a stolen box of corn startch. She ends up at Kims Antiques and immediately finds her best friend in the front room (the first time this has happened). She blurts out that shes been kissed and Lane begins an equally, if not more excited interrogation. My favorite part of said interrogation would be:

&gt;Lane: Where?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: Doose's Market.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: He kissed you in the market?  
&gt;  
&gt;R: On aisle three.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: By the pest spray?  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: Oh, that's a good aisle.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: What defines a good aisle?  
&gt;  
&gt;L: An aisle where you get kissed by the new kid is a good aisle.

Interrupting the interrogation, Mrs. Kim asks who kissed Rory and Lane replies that it was the Lord. As soon as theyre in the clear, they briefly continue before Rory starts to leave.

But, realizing that she cant tell her mother about Dean, Rory turns back to Lane. She knows that her mother will be upset because of how she reacted to the whole almost dropping out of Chilton thing (S1:E1 Pilot). She resolves to wing it, basically.

&amp;#x200B;

**S3-**

*Setting: Lorelais house*

Lorelai is lying on her kitchen floor, surrounded by food. Apparently her fridge is making a noise, prompting her to recreate the sound for the fridge-helpers. They pass her around, either messing with her or being incredibly stupid.

Rory walks into the house, goes to her room, deposits her stolen box of corn starch on her dresser, and then returns to the kitchen to sit at the table and presumably. They give a window for a possible visit that rivals the late and not so great Time Warner Cable. Lorelai is so stressed out by the fridge that she doesnt notice that Rory is acting a little fidgety.

&amp;#x200B;

**S4-**

*Setting: Kims Antiques*

Lorelai walks into the antique store and is almost immediately scared by Mrs. Kim. She wants to collect a walking chair that she bought weeks ago. Mrs. Kim finds a rocking chair- clearly not the one that Lorelai bought- and says that it must have grown over the last 6 weeks in the shop.

Mrs. Kim complains about the 6 week storage period, saying that if Lorelai wasnt so busy, Rory wouldnt be kissing random boys in the market where we buy our food! and then poisoning Lanes brain.

Lorelai is upset that Rory didnt tell her and then leaves, again without the rocking chair.

&amp;#x200B;

**S5-**

*Setting: Stars Hollow, town square*

Rory and Lane are sitting together, dressed as pilgrims and manning a charity table in the town square. Lane is asking to hear the story of Deans kiss over and over, the details never changing. The kisses Lane gets are very chaste and are not cool.

Lane has also been collecting information on Dean. He has a deadly nut allergy and had a girlfriend named Beth for a year that he broke up with before leaving Chicago. Its not clear whether or not they broke up because of the move or not. Either way, they werent in love.

The way that Lanes found all of this out is by talking to Deans best friend, who she has a crush on. Dean hasnt talked about anything but Rory for a while, apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

**S6-**

*Setting: Lukes diner*

While serving Miss Patty and her friend, Luke is again bugged about putting decorations up. He escapes quickly to approach Lorelai who had just claimed her table.

&gt;Luke: Coffee? *\[a brief pause, Lorelai is daydreaming\]* Aw, come on. Are you mad at me too? I mean, a man can't choose whether or not he wants a picture of a fat, stupid bird on his wall? My God, that's the reason the damn Pilgrims came here in the first place.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lorelai: Luke, I wasn't snubbing you. I didn't hear you and now I'm concerned about you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: Sorry, just feeling a little persecuted lately. Coffee?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Please.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: You OK?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Yes, I'm fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: You don't look fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Well thank you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: I just meant you look concerned.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: I'm preoccupied.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: You look concerned.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Well I'm not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: Fine, you just look it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Hey, you know some streamers would look so great in here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: OK, I'm done.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Thank you.

Luke walks away, only to be replaced by Rory. Rorys been taking donations for a while and has to cut their lunch to a snack so that she can cover a missing pilgrim.

Lorelai goes through a weird conversation, trying her best to pry into Rory and get her to admit that she and Dean kissed. It didnt work and she is deflated by that.

Luke approaches the table again.

&gt;Luke: I'm not gonna say you look concerned.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lorelai: I'm not gonna talk about how good you'd look dressed like one of the guys from 'The Crucible.'  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: Fair enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**S7-**

*Setting: Stars Hollow, Dooses Market*

Very similar to her daughter, Lorelai enters the market and stalks Dean through the market, pretending to read boxes. She is then found (and scared) by Luke, who is looking for cream.

&gt;Luke: What are you starin' at?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lorelai: Nothing. Don't look, don't look.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: What is wrong with you today?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Rory got kissed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: What?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Rory had her first kiss and that guy did it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: Ah.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke takes a moment to eye up the bag boy, but then Lorelai continues and he realizes he has to calm her down.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: OK. We need to get you out of here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lorelai: No. That' Lothario over there has wormed his way into my daughter's heart and mouth and for that he must die!  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: That's it, let's go.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: No.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: You're not going to kill the bag boy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Why not?  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: It's double coupon day. You'll bring down the town.

Luke drags Lorelai out of the market and starts to try and decode the babbling. Shes upset that Rory didnt tell her about the kiss and Luke points out that shes probably taking it about as well as Rory thought that she was going to and that that is why she probably decided the way she did.

Then, Lorelai admits that Dean looks similar to the way that Rorys father, Christopher, looked when they were younger. Luke points out that it makes sense that Lorelai and Rory are similar and that they would like similar guys.

&gt;Lorelai: She just -- she thinks I'll disapprove, right? Well I won't. I will show her that I think this is great. Once she sees that I think this is great, everything will be back to normal between us, right? Right -- OK, good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: So you passed the need for an actual person to talk to several minutes ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Oh, yeah. Before the gelato stand.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lu: You're an amazing woman.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lo: Thank you for noticing.

&amp;#x200B;

**S8-**

*Setting: Lorelais house*

Lorelai is waiting for Rory to get home, stalking the windows. She sprints to the couch when Rory approaches the house, sitting with a book as her daughter walks in. Smooth.

A moment of hesitation before Lorelai walks into the kitchen and leans against a cupboard behind Rory.

&gt;Lorelai: So... kissed any good boys lately?

Rory is obviously embarrassed and Lorelai explains how she found out (Mrs. Kim). Its obvious that Lorelai isnt totally fine with the kiss, especially considering she hid the fact that she knew from Rory. If shed been totally fine, its unlikely that she would have done this. 

They resolve awkwardly, Lorelai repeating Im fine too many times, hitting home the fact that shes not comfortable with the fact that Rory is growing up.

&amp;#x200B;

**S9-**

*Setting: Dooses Market*

Lorelai and Rory are going to the market so that they can get candy for their Willy Wonka night. Rory doesnt want to be embarrassed by her mother and gives her a large list of the things shes not allowed to do in front of Dean before agreeing to walk in.

Upon walking in, they dont see Dean. They load up on candy, deciding that he must be on a break. However, when they are ready to check out Dean is at the register, bagging groceries.

Lorelai and Rory appraise him in line, noting his eyes, smile, and butt. They end up talking to Dean, introducing him to Lorelai who compliments his apron. Dean hands Rory the bag and they have a little cutesy moment (featuring his dimples) before Lorelai interrupts and the Gilmore girls leave.

Suddenly, Lorelai needs coffee. Rory runs to the video store to get Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Lorelai is about to head off to Lukes when Dean steps outside with the girls Red Vines.

Before Dean can escape back into the store, Lorelai invites Dean over to the house for the movie night. Momentarily, shes made uncomfortable by the fact that Dean knows where they live, but she quickly moves past it.

Rory is on her way back, successfully having found the movie. Their celebration is short lived because once Lorelai tells Rory that Dean is coming, Rory finds problems with the plan. It makes her look as though she needs her mother to set up a date for her, aka pathetic.

&gt;Rory: He's the boy that I like.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lorelai: I know. I looked for one that you hated but it was really short notice.

Through a mix of humor and reassurances, Lorelai convinces Rory that itll all be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

**S10-**

*Setting: Lorelais house, Rorys bedroom*

Rory is panicking over her clothing, lamenting the fact that she has to look cute on a night that was supposed to be much more simple than that.

Moments after accepting her mothers help, Rory is presented with a cute outfit born from clothes that shed been pouring over for 20 minutes. While this is obviously helpful, it also goes to prove that Lorelai is much more experienced with dating. Rory feels inadequate.

For the first time Lorelai seems to put away feelings about Rory growing up and gives her some real advice.

&gt;Lorelai: Listen, the talking part, you just get used to. The hair twirl I can teach you. And the leaving him amazed part -- with your brain and killer blue eyes I'm not worried. You'll do fine. Just give yourself a little time to get there.

Rory is finally excited.

&amp;#x200B;

**S11-**

*Setting: Lorelais house, living room*

Rory and Lorelai are sitting together in the living room and waiting for Dean, a table full of candy in front of them. Rory is worried that hes not coming and Lorelai calms her, walking to the window... Oh no.

Dean has been captured by Babette and Morey. Lorelai runs out and frees him, letting him go into the house. Babette asks if thats Rorys boyfriend and reveals that she knows about the kiss in the market.

Inside, Dean tries to say that he got there a half hour before, the girls cut him off. They believe him.

Lorelai gives a quick story about Rory that she takes back once Rory shakes her head. On a tour of the house, Lorelai is quick to hide a photo that Rory finds embarrassing. Shes trying to help. Lorelai has to leave the tour to go to the door and get pizza.

Rory lets Dean into her room and hes impressed by the organization. Rory stays by the door and watches him as though it was a habitat at the zoo. She insists that shes okay with him being in the room until he picks up one of her old stuffed animals and teases her with it.

In the hallway, the pizza guy turned out to be Sookie with cupcakes. She wants to see Dean and Lorelai is desperate to kick her out before Rory thinks that Dean is being paraded around in front of Lorelais friends. The real pizza comes and Lorelai quickly pays for it, trying to kick Sookie out again. Finally Sookie leaves, pizza in hand.

Rory and Dean come to the front hall and Sookie enters with the pizza. Rory is clear on why shes there and looks at her mother, clearly upset. Sookie takes all of 20 seconds to thoroughly embarrass Rory and then leaves again. Dean leaves the room and Rory accuses her mother.

&amp;#x200B;

**S12-**

*Setting: Lorelais house, living room*

Lorelai, Rory, and Dean are all on the floor and still eating. The awkwardness has subsided and theyre all bantering evenly. It has gotten a lot easier for them to be alone together. After teasing Lorelai about her Oompa Loompa crush and Rory about her crush on Prince Charming, Dean is subtly invited for the next movie night.

Lorelai leaves the room to get more popcorn and leaves Dean and Rory to chat. Deans already thinking of trying to suggest a movie for movie night. Rory screens his choice and they get a little bit closer. Theyre *super* cute and having a fun time. Lorelai walks back in and sees them, stepping back to the kitchen to give them space.

A while later, theyre involved in the movie. Dean gives Rory another pillow to make her more comfortable and that leads to Rroy just staring at Dean as though she wants to kiss him. When he looks back at her she almost bolts from the room to find her mother.

She says that Lorelai has to come back to the room immediately.

&gt;Lorelai: Why? What happened? Did the bag boy try something?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: He's sitting in there and he's watching the movie and he's perfect and he smells really good.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: What?  
&gt;  
&gt;R: He smells really good and he looks amazing and I am stupid. I said 'thank you.'  
&gt;  
&gt;L: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You said 'thank you?'  
&gt;  
&gt;R: When he kissed me.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: He kissed you again? What is he just out of prison or something?  
&gt;  
&gt;R: No, not now. Yesterday. At the store.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: Oh, all right. Strike the prison comment. He kissed you and you said 'thank you?'  
&gt;  
&gt;R: Yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: Well that was very polite.

Lorelai agrees to go back to the room before Rory and tell Dean that shes washing her face from all the sweets, that way Rory doesnt seem like a dork. She sits near Dean, a space between them for Rory, and theyre silent until she turns off the television and gives him the the entire town will kill you if you hurt her heart speech. Dean isnt deterred.

Dean: You can lay on all the rules you want and you can have the whole town spy on me and stare at me and chase me through the streets --

Lorelai: Oh, I like the chase you through the streets idea.

&gt;D: But I'm not going anywhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;L: Well, it's gonna be a short chase then, isn't it?

They settle on the fact that Lorelai will try to like Dean as long as Dean is good to Rory.

&amp;#x200B;

**S13-**

*Setting: Lorelais house, porch*

Dean and Rory are outside, saying goodnight. Dean enjoyed himself.

They kiss goodnight and this time Rory doesnt say thank you, but Dean does. She chuckles and watches him leave.  


**S14-**

*Setting: Lorelais house, Lorelais bedroom*

Lorelai and Rory are saying goodnight and Rory says that shes happy everything went well. On her way out, she asks her mom whats wrong.

While she isnt mad, Lorelai is sort of sad that she didnt get to hear about the kiss. Rory jumps into bed and tells her mother all about it.

&gt;Rory: OK, I was in the aisle where the ant spray is.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lorelai: That's a good aisle.  
&gt;  
&gt;R: I know, that's what Lane said too. But anyway, so he was working and I go into the store and I sort of walked around and was pretending to shop...

&amp;#x200B;

**Observations**\-

**S1:**

Even *Taylor* knows better than to go behind the counter at the diner.

Lorelai walks into Lukes sacred space (S1:E5:Scene8 Cinnamons wake) and then instead of chasing her out like he did Sookie, Luke hands her tongs. Interesting, is it not?

**S2:**

Dean is obviously excited to see Rory. I don't doubt that he still talks about her all the time.

Rory is incredibly nervous around Dean and shows her inexperience with boys.

The kiss was very sweet and I felt as though Dean planned it ahead of time.

Lane is living through Rory in a way that isn't overbearing. Sometimes Lorelai seems as though she's living through Rory, but Lane never seems to be any sort of controlling. She's just happy for her friend.

Apparently Rory never has any trouble telling Lorelai about anything but boys.

Lane is Rorys confidant when Lorelai cant be.

**S3:**

Rory keeps the corn starch for a souvenir of her first kiss with Dean.

**S4**:

Mrs. Kim sees Lorelai as an irresponsible parent.

**S5:**

Dean used to have another girlfriend in Chicago. It's likely that the only reason that they broke up was because of Dean's move.

**S6:**

Luke has been persecuted by the rest of the town (mostly Taylor) about the lack of decorations. He's stressed by it.

Luke is willing to listen Lorelai's problems in the middle of a work day.

Luke is sorta like a bar tender in that he hears a lot of town problems passively.

**S7:**

Lorelai is really not okay with the fact that Rory is growing up.

Luke is more reasonable over the fact that Rory is growing up, possibly because he's not her parent.

Lorelai and Rory like similar men and Luke points that out.

Luke is fine with listening to Lorelai talk to herself.

**S10:**

Lorelai wants to be a good friend when it comes to Rory's crushes.

**S11:**

Sookie, Babette, and Morey are looped into the town gossip. Lorelai can't even think about Rory's babies at this point.

**S12:**

Dean is willing to put his neck out for Rory.

**S13:**

Dean wasn't offended or upset about the ""thank you"" gaffe.

**S14:**

Lorelai is either good at pretending to be excited or actually excited for her daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

**Getting to the point:**

This was the episode that really solidified Dean as a character. He was able to insert himself into a Gilmore movie night and survive. He kissed Rory and survived. It also showed that the whole town is excited for Rory to have a boyfriend.

This episode shows an important flaw in Lorelai and Rorys relationship. While they say that they share everything, theres clearly a problem sharing things concerning love and relationships. Lorelai is clearly afraid that Rory will make the same mistakes that she made when she was young, as it was said in ep. 1. While this fear is understandable (and familiar, coming from the child of a 19 year old mom), the way Lorelai presents her fear is definitely detrimental to her relationship with her daughter. Not only does she make Rory scared to tell her about things concerning boys (specifically Dean) with her reaction in ep. 1, but she reinforced that fear during scene 8 of this episode by seeming so uncomfortable (Im fine).

To completely contradict my last point, Lorelai does go on to be a pretty solid mother and friend for the rest of the episode (post asking Dean to come over). She does what Rory asks her to do in every case, whether that be hiding a picture of her baby butt or coming back into the living room to relieve the tension Rory feels at being left alone with the boy she likes.

What is interesting is that Lorelai points out that the towns interest in him will quickly turn sour if anything bad happens. While its nice that Dean is willing to do that to date Rory, hes a kid. He shouldnt have a whole town to contend with for a high school relationship. I understand being worried about your daughters first romance, but threatening a kid about what will happen if his relationship doesnt end well (despite the fact that most high school relationships dont end well) seems overbearing and not cool.

Overall, Lorelais behavior in this episode reinforces the idea that Lorelai was only 16 when she had Rory and is going through all this stress at a younger age than most mothers. Something to remember about parenting is that often youll get into habits concerning the way you raise/punish/etc your kids and that all of these habits were set for Lorelai when she was very young and had next to no support. She isnt perfect, but she is trying her absolute best to be a good mom to Rory and shes realizing that shes wrong sometimes. Its the most you could hope for.   


**My reaction:**

If I said I didnt do the stupid squeal/flapping my hands thing when Dean kissed her, I would be lying. The corn starch is also ridiculously cute. So, good episode. 

This episode also had some great Luke/Lorelai moments. The he must die line was really funny.

After the Independence Inn has its fire, they eventually sell the property, and Lorelei and Sookie start off on opening their own place.

Afterwards, the Inn is never spoken of again whatsoever.  Not in the original run that I can tell, and definitely not in the revival.  

You would think that a business sold and re-opened by a new owner, one which had, from all appearances, been a critical part of the local economy and culture would have been mentioned at least once.  Especially since if re-opened, it would be Loreleis direct competition.

So was it re-opened after the sale or no?  Was it bulldozed?  Disappeared? Abandoned?  If abandoned, why doesnt Lorelei consider it during the revival for an expansion instead of the nun nursing home?

Is there another entrance to that, like how the entrance for the Belcher's apartment isn't thru the burger place but next to it?

When Luke buys the building next door and smashes the wall inbetween buildings, does his apartment now span both Luke's diner and the Soda Shoppe?

When they're remodeling the apartment, it looks like more works is being done over Luke's diner itself than anything else.

They dated for a long time and they would talk every day and now they avoid even making eye contact. They miss each other and that's totally called for. 

Imagine if Rory and Dean got over the awkwardness, didn't become romantic, and became absolutely fabulous friends. They could hang out and enthuse about each others romance issue and Rory could've been the godmother of Dean's first child (or one of the others). Imagine her being able to confide in him and him being able to confide in her.

 They always supported each other but they weren't alike enough to be a good couple, it'd be nice if they weren't obligated to accompany each other to things that they don't enjoy. They'd also be more honest with each other and they'd have more insight into each other's tendencies. Dean could tell Rory that he didn't like it when she did certain things in their relationship and vice versa. 

I just want you to imagine for a second:

Jess and Rory last pass season 3 (because there's no stupid spin off that steals him from us) and Rory and Dean become good (100% platonic) friends that would never think of dating again. This leads to scenes like the diner scene in S3:E13 where Dean has Jess take his order. Then Dean and Jess's relationship evolves to the point where Jess knows Dean isn't going for Rory but acts grumpy because he's Jess. Dean and Jess bond and benignly argue, which always ends in a big bear hug from Dean because he's massive and Jess can't get away from the jock fast enough to stop him... God, the bromance could've been real.

The reason I like Logan is because he's the first person that really challenges Rory. 

I just think the writers did a great job with demonstrating things. For example, the rocket gift was a perfect demonstration of fidelity when they did long distance. Another example is the hay bale maze when they were talking about how they were going to think through long term decisions, that they would factor each other in. The scene where they are at the fork in the maze was such a perfect demonstration of that. 

I really liked how Logan was so offended by her article talking about privilege and they both grew and had viewpoints challenged because of it. 

I liked that Logan and Rory kind of failed (him with his company, her with not getting the NYT job) but then found their own footing career wise. Of course, I still wish they ended up together in San Francisco with their avocado tree but that's a discussion for another time.

Last thing that I absolutely LOVED, was for Rory's graduation party when Richard tells Lorelai that ""it takes a special person to inspire all of this."" It was such a complete moment where Lorelai finally got the validation she craved and her parents finally understood the value of the life she created. The fact that the party brought Lorelai and Luke back together too was perfect because Lorelai first fell in love with Luke because of the way he loved Rory...it just fit well together.

He never did anything wrong, let alone he was genuinely a good person, and had good morals and philosophies for life. 
Now let me get to Jess. Jess is the most insecure, petty little child I have ever seen on this show. And Rory falling for him shows a whole other side to Rory that shares those qualities. He doesnt care about anyone around him, hes an asshole to literally everyone including Rory, and he uses this bad boy persona to try and cover up his insecurity. His behavior only brings out the same thing in Rory. 
Lets take the scene at the town dance marathon thing. When Jess puts his arm around that blonde chick, so Rory puts her arm around dean. Did anyone see deans face? He saw right through all of that, because hes smart and real as fuck. But Jess and Rory are just playing this insecure little game. 
So maybe its a good thing rory and dean broke up. Rory is too insecure and petty for a clear thinking good person like dean. She deserves that little child, Jess, that for some reason people who watch this show love?

Emily and Richard are not perfect, and she was right to leave (IMO), HOWEVER... They opened their door for her. They drove her to the community service, got her a job, gave her a place to herself (for a while, anyway), got her a good lawyer. Imagine if, after fighting Lorelai, she had nowhere to go? Besides, Lorelai reached out to her parents for the first time to ask for help, not financial, but for something important. After all those years! And they turned her down (this was on them, tho, not Rory's fault - Mostly) to help you!

Let me try and explain why :)

A lot of fans were disappointed because they thought that Rory would not 'end up like Lorelai', but as someone already pointed out, Rory is definitely not in the same position that Lorelai was in, as she is way older, has completed her education and is not particularly struggling financially (correct me if I am wrong).

They only thing they share is that they do not have a life partner to raise their child with and, although I understand that can sound frustrating, I don't think it proves anything.
Rory didn't do 'better' or 'worse' than her mum, because their lives are different and it's too simplistic to argue that for her to get pregnant makes her be any more like Lorelai, because (as we all know) they have very very different ways of doing things in life anyway.

Plus, I liked the cliffhanger idea: it's a good feeling of suspension that implies that it is all about to finish, but also to start again. The circle of life, ya know? I like how it made me feel, kinda confused and holding my breath and then having to figure out for myself what the next turn would be, which I think it's what food writing makes you feel like.

What do you think? Am I the only one who feels this way? :)

I have watched the series upwards of 2000000 times and I'm currently rewatching. I recently discovered the Gilmore Guys podcast, and I have been trying to correspond the podcast episodes to the show. I listened to this podcast episode before the show, and after having the new perspective, it totally flipped my view on Jess.  I'd like to discuss it with you!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I was totally Team Jess since the first time I watched the series. I never thought he deserved any hate, probably because I was a youngster who thought that bad boy/Edward Cullen/generally creepy qualities were hot. However, the Gilmore Guys  discuss how Jess was pretty creepy with Rory upstairs at the party. I truly never saw the episode that way, again because of my bias towards the character.

&amp;#x200B;

After watching the episode again, I realized he does put Rory in a pretty scary position. It's so uncomfortable to watch, and although I know he is going through a tough time (he was recently told he could not graduate, he could not go to prom)... it does not excuse his behavior. I know the episode premiered in 2003, so the discussion of sexual assault/coercion has changed greatly, but it definitely makes me question Jess completely. It also makes me question my love of Rory and Jess, and I was wondering if you have had similar thoughts. I find it pretty easy to excuse his behavior, as I literally never even saw the episode in that way until listening to the podcast, which is crazy.
