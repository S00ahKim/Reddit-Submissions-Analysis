She watched it when it came on the WB. I never gave it a chance until now.

She didn't tell me what was going to happen and said I might not like the ending...turns out she was screwing with me! I actually loved the ending! I'm so mad that it took so long for Luke to get it together and be honest, and not so passive. But it was a great happy ending. I am also surprised that Logan just went away. 

What would a better ending have been for this show if it continued? I couldn't imagine a better ending.

Other points:
- Emily &amp; Richard Gilmore are great characters
- Does everyone else hate Chris as much as I do? Every time he showed up I wanted him to leave immediately and wish he would have had a black eye after his last fight with Luke.
- why was Sookie pregnant for basically the entirety of the show?
- Dean was so lame. What a dork! I'm glad he never really came back.

Anyhow, what a great show. Lots of fun to watch!",8,25,False,self,,,,,

After thinking about it for a second, I realized that Emily herself has a similar moment later in the series when she discovers that Luke and Lorelai are an item. Although not quite as drastic as asking Lorelai to leave Luke at the alter, she does arrange for Christopher to show up and attempt to break them up since she thinks that Christopher is a much more suitable match for Lorelai.

We lived west of Hartford, let's say somewhere between SH and the grandparents house. We went to Washington Depot where ASP mentioned was a lot of the inspiration for SH. I have to say that most of my real CT experience was (of course) not like GG. Some of my findings:

1. You could never make it from Stars Hollow area to Hartford in 30 minutes. The highways are so small and winding it would take awhile to find a good route (think Lorelai and Luke's argument on the best way to get to I84).
2. You could also never take the bus from SH to Hartford. Maybe you could but it would take hours, the buses are terrible.
3. Finding a great cup of coffee is a struggle.  It took me 7 months to find a truly great coffee. There are Dunkin Donuts literally everywhere and no one bothers going elsewhere (if there were anywhere else).
4. No one as wealthy as Richard and Emily would ever live in Hartford. There are some real slums there. Fairfield, West Hartford, or Mystic, maybe.
5. I loved a lot of people in CT but there were few quirky characters. No one cared about music, random pop culture. I wasn't expecting Lorelai and Rory around ever corner but I hoped for more people with my common interest. I am from Seattle and the GGs seem like they would feel a lot more at home in the culture there.

 If you ever visit CT looking for Stars Hollow, I would go to Salisbury in the NW corner of the state. I had the best coffee there and the overall town was quaint and charming with a handful of characters as well.

I'd love to hear your thoughts to see if we had similar experiences. I liked it ok there but ultimately moved to VT.",11,7,False,self,,,,,

 -Luke and Lorelai's wedding is on the top of my list, we had to deal with their breakup and that whole April arc, it would only be right to have their relationship come full circle and have them married. How will they adapt to married life? any kids in their future? I would think so 

-- Emily. Unfortunately with the passing of the great Ed Hermann, her story becomes a bit more difficult to come up with. However, I think it would be a great opportunity to explore her character and how she adapts to living without Richard. Maybe have her moved to Stars Hollow, and watch Lorelai adapt to something shes always tried to avoid.

-- Rory, I always wondered what she does after the campaign. Did she go overseas and become the next Christiane Amanpour? Probably not, maybe just started working at a newspaper in Philadelphia, where she finds Jess and lives happily with him; until Logan comes back and we get the Dean/Jess arc again (just kidding, even though that arc could be fun to watch with Logan in the mix instead of Dean).

1. In S3E15, Taylor comments to Lorelai that the Doose clan is ""prone to night terrors"". Night terrors affect ~1% of the adult population, and there is indeed evidence that they are congenital. Kirk reveals that he suffers from night terrors in S4.

2. Taylor constantly goes out of his way to give Kirk jobs, despite Kirk's incompetence at almost everything, and his frequent catastrophic failures to complete the tasks Taylor gives him.

3. Kirk's father is never mentioned on the show (as far as I and the Gilmore Girls wiki can tell). His mother is an apparent recluse who never appears on screen. No mention is made of her ever being married.

4. Kirk and Taylor have eerily similar personalities.

So... did the writers intend this as an Easter egg? Are we supposed to read between the lines and conclude that Kirk is Taylor's illegitimate son?

Besides that thread, I haven't read this subreddit or anything on the show while watching the show, so I jumped into this show blindly, all the way to the end.

Thought I'd post a followup thread for finishing the show with some random thoughts and feelings I have upon finishing it. These are in no order. Just rambling.

- I hate April. She ruined Lorelai and Luke :( Hated Anna too. I understand her reasons behind what she did, but damn did it frustrate me. Just sucks that we didn't get more Lorelai and Luke time in the end because the writers decided to force some plot/wrench for the sake of drama.

- I was so happy when Rory denied Logan's proposal. I didn't like him much. He did change and mature a lot through the course of the show, which was nice. But there's something about him I couldn't get over. Maybe because of how he treated Jess and acted the part of the blonde dick at Yale well. Which I found hypocritical because he had so many girl friends that he was around along with girls he slept with. But then he flips his shit when Rory talks to an ex. 

- A big part of me wanted Rory/Jess to be the endgame couple. But at the same time, it was very nice having Rory, a very strong female lead, not be defined by who she ended up with in the end.

- Chris... still feel the same way I did months ago. Hate him even more now and couldn't stand the way they got together. I do felt like it needed to happen to get it over with. I just wish and can't fathom why Lorelai immediately slept with Chris right after her and Luke had that fight. Chris was a crappy dad, imo. Showed up to be involved with Rory when he felt like it. Disappears when he can't handle stuff. 

- Chris just suddenly becoming crazy rich? How convenient :P

- I loved Lane's character. But very disappointed in how she ended up. Has sex once, and hates it and swears it off? Okay. Oh, that one time she had sex, she happens to get pregnant. With twins. Right out of fanfiction. I did end up liking Zack near the end. But thought it was so forced when they decided to get married because of a fight.

- Dean. Oh Dean, why did they write you to become an asshole? Cheats on his wife for Rory, is emotionally abusive to her... Ugh.

- Okay, I guess I did look up something while I watched - McCarthy's pregnancy and how they had to write it in the show. It did baffle me how Sookie decided to make such a huge decision to make Jackson get a vasectomy right then and there, which in real life would not have happened like that.

Alright, a lot of negativity above with the annoyances I had with some characters. But don't get me wrong. I absolutely loved this show. Going through some own personal relationship issues, this show is the best medicine. So many feels and ups and downs with the characters I got to experience.

- I loved how they cultivated the small town feel with the cast of recurring characters to capture how Stars Hollows feels. Makes me want to live in a place like that. 

- Kirk is probably my favorite character. His homemade movie is the best thing I've ever seen.

- The best thing of the show is their portrayal of the tight relationship between mother and daughter. Though something I felt like Lorelai acted more like a friend than a mom to Rory at sometimes. A bit unrealistic, but I loved the quick banter. I loved how close they were. Lauren Graham is just amazing.

- It felt a bit forced, but I did like how they had Rory go through the ""uncertain phase"" with her life when she quits Yale and stops talking to her mom. Where she pulls a 'Graduate' and just lounges around in her $40k sex house. I felt like it had to happen and had to explore her feelings of uncertainty. 

- Luke is awesome. Was so happy when Lorelai goes to him at the end :') Wish they had more time together (thanks April...). 

- Lorelai. Frustrating sometimes and makes bad decisions. But one of my favorite characters. She's not perfect. She's very flawed. But I loved her overall. Did I mention that Lauren Graham is awesome?

- Not a serious note, just something amusing. But I feel like 95% of the Stars Hollow could not give a shit about the drama in the show. It made it seem like the whole town is privy to the drama and involved in it. And when they throw the big party for Rory at the end, the whole town is there for her. I feel like 95% of the town is like ""oh great, let's hear about Rory *again*."" Or just have no idea or care what's going on in her life. They just show up at the party for the food.

Okay, this turned out longer than expected. Apologies for the length. I know I'm missing some thoughts too. 

TL;DR: Overall, this is an amazing 'casual' feel good show and I can't wait to rewatch it. Now time to listen to the Gilmore Guys podcast and cry.",13,12,False,self,,,,,

I know we all agreed that it couldn't be because [/u/piglet29](http://www.reddit.com/user/piglet29) pointed out that when Rory complimented Kirk's suit, he said  ""Thanks, it was the suit my father was buried with"".

But THEN I thought, if his father was buried *IN* it, that means the suit should be 6-feet underground on a dead guy. Why would Kirk have it?

Maybe his mother lied about the suit. And maybe Kirk's father killed himself after finding out about his wife's betrayal, hence why he died when Kirk was so young. ",13,7,False,self,,,,,
