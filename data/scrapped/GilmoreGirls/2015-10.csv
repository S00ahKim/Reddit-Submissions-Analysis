My opinion is yes but with some modifications maybe to fit ASP's writting. Even ASP had a ""darker"" child (""Sasha"") in bunheads playing as the more independend and cool (in the surface) out of the bunch.

**UPDATE**: **I'm *purely* talking about the daughters (Rory and Amber)** and I WISH NO COMPARISON between Lorelai Gilmore and Sarah Braverman (they are the same person in different roles). I'm talking more about Amber as an idea and a concept as Lorelai's daughter (her personallity, her looks, her attitude towards life etc) not putting her story from parenthood to the Gilmore realm, that would be crazy.

What I've usually done in the past was watch all the seasons that contain Jess and and quit for a while then restart from S1 lol. Now you know who I'd pick for the Dean/Jess/Logan debate.)

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the series and consider it to be one of my favorite shows, BUT I am somewhat disappointed with how Rory and Lorelai's storyline developed and concluded. Especially in the last two seasons.

To start off, I expected more from Roryher complacency after 'failing' at Yale was off-putting and reinforced the privilege she grew up with. This theme of privilege and self-centeredness carried on throughout the rest of the series and I could never really look at Rory the same way again. Ultimately I was happy about the decision she made to go on the Obama bus. That decision was more characteristic of the Rory in earlier seasons.  One of my favorite scenes was her last conversation with Lane. It was so sincere and gave a lot of importance to Lane's character, which was often overlooked.

The biggest disappointment for me was definitely Lorelai's story. Episode after episode she just became a walking train wreck. It was really hard to watch. Some episodes I would root for her and want her to be happy but then something would happen and it would just be sad. Prime example is her sleeping with Christopher after fighting with Luke. Then proceeding to elope and get divorced. Another is her acting very immature about Richard &amp; Emily attending Yale's parent's weekend.

In the series finale, watching Luke and Lorelai kiss was too cringeworthy for me to watch. It was like the writers were thinking, 'Oh, everyone just loves like and Lorelai together fuck it let's have them kiss.' I think they should have stopped at the conversation in the corn maze when the two were apologizing to each otherthat felt more genuine and would have been a great place to cap their relationship.

Does anyone here feel the same way I do? Would love to hear your thoughts (: I'm so glad I found this sub! Now I can fill the void GG has left haha
