Dean emotionally manipulated Rory into sleeping with him WHILE HE WAS STILL MARRIED TO LINDSEY, and when the broke up for what seems like the 3rd time (who can really keep count?) It is because he can't handle the world her family comes from, that she comes with money and obligations. He also never kept up with her humor or hobbies.

Logan was quick-witted and understood the pressures that family can have on you and they went to Yale together and were on the newspaper together and that's it. That's all they have in common. He didn't encourage her to go back to Yale and while this can be seen as allowing Rory to do what she wants and be her own person, he fails to see that she is giving up her zest for life. 

Jess not only follows along with Rory's humor but gets the references and plays along. Yes he swoops her out of the stability of Dean's relationship, but he charms her in a way that Dean never could. Dean is safe but Jess shows her a real-life, down-to-earth experience and how you can be intelligent and still have youthful experiences. He knows her well enough to see her falling out of love with herself. Yes, he did leave unannounced but he had just met his father which understandably took a toll on him. In season 6, episode 8, Jess finds Rory at her grandparent's house and sees the crap. He knows she is not being true to herself and even though he is no longer dating her, he calls her out for it and him speaking up, is how she is reunited with Lorelei.",70,144,False,spoiler,,,,,

Everyone is overestimating his ability as a teenager/young adult to cope with the shitty cards he was dealt. He fishes himself out in the end and is in a much better place, not something we can say for a lot of the characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jess is hurt by **the town**. Hes a kid, hes neglectfully shipped of to his uncle (that he barely knows) and he does a few pranks and some stupid things. He doesnt do well in school. Not only do adults not like him, but they all hate him. He fulfils that role in a cycle of hatred, expecting a child to break that is foolish and expects far too much.

Jess is hurt by **his teachers**. Sure, he missed the guidance counselors meetings, the principals meetings, and a lot of his classes. But the teachers still saw him. The teachers knew he worked at Lukes. As someone with 6 teachers in my family and has been in the teaching major, everyone who goes into teaching goes in with the intentions of helping children be their best selves.

Jess is hurt by **his school**. The only time we see or hear him with his classmates, the ones we dont know, hes fighting. He doesnt have friends in Stars Hollow.

Jess is hurt by **his principal**. How *dare*a grown man look at a child who is scared and panicked over being held back, someone who has never felt comfortable in his school, and say that no one will miss him? The only things that make me this angry is what happened to Luke and Lorelai late in the show and April.

Jess is hurt by **his mother**. She doesnt have time or energy for him, but she has time for boyfriend after boyfriend, renaissance fairs, and probably a billion other things. InTeach Me Tonight, he even says his mother would have a group of reasons for him not to succeed in school or later life.

Jess is hurt by **his father**. He left him, he ran away from his responsibilities because the fear was more than his love for Jess. He left him to take care of an irresponsible and flakey mother. When the guilt overcame Jimmy, he tracked Jess down only to leave him again.

Jess is hurt **by Luke**. For all of his virtues and the good things that he does, Luke kicks Jess out when hes at his lowest. He doesnt go after him and he doesnt sit Jess down when he comes back in 4.12/13 and tell him that he loves him. He doesnt manage it for a year, and Jess is only a kid. I understand the outburst, but not bringing Jess back was something that I can imagine he would always regret.

Jess is hurt **by Lorelai**. She treated him like actual garbage for most of the series. It was really hard to watch.

Jess is hurt **by Rory**. The lack of trust she has in him the entire time they date, as shown in 3.14. When she wont take his word for truth and has to turn to Dean, Jess wont accept her apology becauseI wouldnt believe me either. Then she tries to use him to get back at Logan in 6.18 and it breaks his heart again.

And people wonder why Jess, someone who has never felt completely taken care of or loved, lashes out?

She cant even wear a normal bathing suit on spring break or talk to a cute guy, despite having had boyfriends and many guy friends in the past. She was embarrassed by even the mention of wearing a bikini when Lorelei suggested her one piece was too modest. Even when she tried going on that casual date with her classmate, it was painfully uncomfortable as if she had never been on a date before.

I think the meet up between Jess and Rory could have still happened but it should have been more drawn out. Them getting a few drinks talking for hours about their memories of the crazy town and where they are in their lives currently. Eventually Jess could have made an offhand comment about her writing a book. Then they would talk and laugh and discuss what people would deserve an appearance in said book. 

However, all we got from Jess was an awkward 5 minute conversation where he suggests her writing a book then leaving. I think that this conversation was a ridiculous way to underuse the character of Jess.",15,53,False,self,,,,,

She essentially tells Rory she wont have a place to live, goes behind Rorys back to her parents, tantrums when her parents reconsider after hearing Rorys side. She tells Luke Rory was supposed to have everything I didnt have. The issue was never about Rorys dreamsit was about Lorelai living vicariously through Rory.

All of that is frustrating enough, but the scene that really kills me is when she gives all of Rorys stuff to her parents and says, You win. Shes all yours. Im out. Really? Your kid does one thing you dont like, that you disagree with, and you refuse to attend her court hearing, get all of her stuff out of your house, and refuse to have anything to do with her? You hand over the reigns of parenting to your parents and tell them that shes, in essence, their daughter now? Even Emily and Richard didnt kick Lorelai out and get rid of her stuff. The hypocrisy and immaturity of the whole thing makes me want to slap her. It isnt about Roryits about Lorelai being put out because she feels like her parents have replaced her with Rory. Shes jealous, shes  angry, and she responds by cutting her kid off entirely. It makes it hard to take her seriously when she opines about how manipulative and controlling Emily is. Lorelai, if anything, is worseand much less self aware of it, which makes it more infuriating.

And she faces zero consequences for all of this! Rory eventually gives in and does what Lorelai wants (because Rory, in the end, is Christophers daughterletting herself get bowled over by Lorelai) and only then does Lorelai magnanimously grant forgiveness. Lorelai and Emily are exactly the sameexcept that Emily is very blunt about wanting to control Lorelais life, and Lorelai wont admit that she wants to control Rory. It was simply Emilys misfortune that she wound up with a daughter like her, and Lorelais fortune that she wound up with a daughter whose personality was more like Christophers.

I've searched through here, and I'm not sure anyone has made a pragmatic case pro-Jess, so I'm going to take a wack at it.

Basically, it's this: **Jess is the only person who doesn't coddle Rory.** Upon reflection, and especially post-revival, I feel like a major theme of Gilmore Girls is how Lorelai is ultimately unable to shield Rory from everything she wanted to shield her from. Despite her best efforts, Rory screws up over and over again, and even ends up in almost the same place Lorelai ended up in, and I'm starting to really see why - *everyone treats Rory like she's actually made of porcelain.* While there are some moments where people call her out, it seems like the only one to actually put his foot down to not do what Rory wants just because Rory wants it, consistently, is Jess.

&amp;#x200B;

See below for an assortment of instances where Rory could have taken responsibility, and how the people in her life reacted. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Jess &amp; Dean Thing**

Rory kisses Jess while she's still with Dean, says ""Don't tell anyone,"" and then doesn't contact him for an entire summer. Meanwhile, it's become more and more obvious to Dean that Rory likes Jess. Hell, he even says as much. And yet - Dean stays with her. 

After Rory comes back from Washington D.C., she comes back to the natural consequences of her lack of action - Jess is with another girl. She continues to pine for Jess while she's with Dean and Dean continues to allow her to treat him like garbage. Not Jess - Jess hardly skips a beat before calling her out on her, frankly, garbage. 

&amp;#x200B;

    JESS: Her names Shane.

    RORY: As in come back?

    JESS: Yup.

    RORY: Well, great. Thats great. Really, its great.

    JESS: So Ive heard.

    RORY: Well, it is.

    JESS: Are you upset about something?

    RORY: No.

    JESS: I mean, me and Shane 

    RORY: What about you and Shane?

    JESS: I dont know, it didnt exactly bring a smile to your face.

    RORY: Well, Im still freaked out about the, uh, snowcone machine.

    JESS: Okay.

    RORY: I could care less about you and Shane.

    JESS: Good.

    RORY: It just surprised me, thats all.

    JESS: Why?

    RORY: Because.

    JESS: Because why?

    RORY: Because of what happened at Sookies wedding.

    JESS: Ah.

    RORY: Yeah, so me coming back here and just seeing you with Shane just kind of threw me for a sec.

    JESS: I'm sorry, did I hear from you at all this summer? Did I just happen to miss the thousands of phone calls you made to me, or did the postman happen to lose all those letters you wrote to me? You kiss me, you tell me not to say anything. . .very flattering, by the way. You go off to Washington. . . then nothing. Then you come back here all put out because I didn't just sit around and wait for you like Dean would've done? And yeah, what about Dean? Are you still with him? 'Cause last time I checked, you were, and I haven't heard anything to the contrary. Plus, the two of you walking around the other day like some damn Andy Hardy movie. Seemed to me like youre still pretty together. I half expected you to break into a barn and put on a show.

    RORY: When did you see me with Dean?

    JESS: At that stupid summer insanity plea the town put on.

    RORY: Oh, Im surprised you could see anything with Shanes head plastered to your face.

    JESS: You didnt answer me.

    RORY: About what?

    JESS: Did you call me at all?

    RORY: No.

    RORY: Im not talking about snowcones.
    
    JESS: What are you talking about then?

    RORY: Glad to tell you.

    JESS: See you around.

    RORY: Whatever.

    JESS: Right back at ya.
    

Contrast that to Dean, who doesn't dump her for another five episodes, and Lorelai, who comforts her after her very well-deserved dumping. Hell, I don't recall Dean even calling her directly out until said break up. 

Jess, meanwhile, doesn't get together with Rory until after having a good conversation with her and clarifying that she and Dean are over. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Jess and Rory's Relationship**

I don't want to get into the whole thing here,  but I do want to make this point: Jess doesn't treat Rory like an absolute princess, and I think that's a very good thing. Relationships are about compromise and healthy communication and really being there for each other - and *both* Jess and Rory suck at this at this point in their lives. That being said, I think it's a great thing **for Rory's development** that even in this stage, Jess was able to say ""I don't want to do that."" or ""I'm not going to go that."" even when Rory wanted him to. That's one of the things that Luke and Jess do have in common - though they like Lorelai and Rory, they're not going to bend over backwards and change everything about themselves just to ""enter their world."" It's unhealthy! So despite how rough it was, I personally applaud Jess for setting limits and sticking to them in their relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Dean &amp; Lindsay Thing**

Speaking of Dean - though he dumps her, he never really makes her take responsibility for her crap. After they break up, he's still all doe-y eyed and puppy-like with her, and this persists all the way to the point of him cheating on his wife with Rory. 

All throughout Season 4, we see Rory go through some healthy, necessary-for-growth struggling. She has to drop a class because she can't take the workload, she's figuring out life away from her mother, she's not quite comfortable at Yale yet. Perfect opportunities for her to understand that though she is very studious and intelligent, she's also just like everybody else. A good friend would be gentle and supportive while she deals with these harsh but necessary realizations.

Not Dean! He coddles her, instead, right into bed. 

And what's most ridiculous about all this, of course, is that Lorelai doesn't stick to her guns. She has a very necessary and confrontational conversation with Rory, and then retreats like crazy once she sees the effects it has on her relationship with her daughter. Rory treats Lorelai like crap, and Lorelai takes it. She then goes on to *passively watch as Rory pursues the relationship with Dean.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember when Lindsay's mom yelled at Rory in the square? GOOD!! Lorelai should have stepped aside and let her daughter hear it. Yes, it sucks that Lindsay didn't do it herself, and that her mother did it in public, but I can't get over the fact that Lorelai coddles her daughter straight through this mess. Rory needed to learn to take responsibility, and neither Lorelai or Dean allow her to. 

 

**Rejecting Jess**

This might be a surprising opinion coming from me, but I was so happy that Rory turned Jess down at Yale. Mostly, I was happy for Jess, but also happy for Rory because this is a point in time where she makes a choice and has to actually stick with it.

&amp;#x200B;

When she rejects Jess, he actually goes away and continues living his life. He doesn't give Rory the opportunity to go back on it. She says no, and he turns around and leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

**Running Away to her Grandparents'** 

Girl gets told that she doesn't have the talent for journalism, and because she's never really had to deal with such a rejection, she runs away. Lorelai finally puts her foot down, and Emily and Richard swoop in to rescue her and allow her to avoid the issues. Such stunting of growth, such huge immaturity.  To me, it makes a lot of sense that Jess is the one who comes in and confronts her about it, since again, **he's the only one who has made her actually take responsibility for her actions.**

&amp;#x200B;

And other assorted favorites, such as Lorelai bailing her out of being late for a test, or everyone telling her it was a-okay to write that really mean review about the ballerina, Lorelai not allowing her to take any responsibility for the car accident, or Rory being upset that her mother was angry at her for being out the entire night.

&amp;#x200B;

So there it is. I am so pro-Jess, and it isn't because of his attractiveness, intelligence or bad-boy vibes. It's because the kid knew how to say no and stand up for himself, and I believe that is exactly what Rory needed.

In later seasons he never acts as cold towards Rory as Shera does and even seems frustrated with how silly she became once she joined the DAR, when she didn't want Logan to go to London and actually work for a living.

All that said, the show  wants you to think that Rory IS the best journalist who ever lived, and that Mitchum had no idea what he's talking about.

Well, of course you know. That would explain why your weight goes up and down 30 pounds every other month. But that's your cross to bear. But these are ugly realities. No one needs to talk about them. Those kids are staying together for as long as they like. You won't stop them. Now, enjoy the event.""

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed the Luke/Dragonfly parallel when Rachel gives Lorelai the photo of the Dragonfly. (S1X19) At the end of that episode, Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the front yard of the Dragonfly just looking at it, and this exchange happens:

    RORY: So how long you think before you guys own this place?
    
    LORELAI: Oh sweetie, it's going to be a very very very long time.
    
    RORY: You think it'll still be here?
    
    (The front screen door falls down)
    
    LORELAI: I think we got a shot.

This episode is really Luke/Lorelai and Luke/Rachel heavy. It's the one where Rachel gives Lorelai the tour of Luke's apartment, and then asks Lorelai to put in a good word for her with Luke. It's so, so painful because we as an audience don't know if Rachel is going to be permanent and if Lorelai/Luke will ever happen. So I totally take this exchange here as ASP winking at the audience and giving us hope. Eventually, Lorelai and Luke literally get together on the trial run of the Dragonfly - that's what really sealed it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently on Season 5x11 (rewatch), and it's the episode where snow is treating Lorelai really badly. It's also the episode where Chris' father dies, and Lorelai goes over to comfort him and lies to Luke about it. Contextually, it's also right in the midst of Rory getting more and more into the Yale world, which is the beginning of Lorelai sorta losing her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dean's two options are Hufflepuff and Gryffindor. He's got the athleticism (Hockey, softball, and basketball are what I can think of), the general popularity (everyone was talking about the new kid in season 1), and the confidence (1.01 when he just straight out admits he's been watching Rory?? I could never) of the classic Gryffindor member. The issue with declaring Dean a Gryffindor is that he doesn't have the bravery and the nerve to strive for *more*. Rory has the big plans for Harvard (then Yale) and she believes in him, telling him that he could go to a good school and that he could do things with his life. The reality is that Dean is threatened by the difference in social class between himself and Rory as well as the perceived intelligence, and instead of facing that challenge head-on, he turns away from it. However, that's not to say that wanting the white picket fence, dog, and 2.5 kids is bad. Not wanting to change the world isn't sinful. Dean is a hard worker, he's patient (especially from 2.08-3.07), dedicated to what he cares about, and modest. That modesty is specifically why, despite his falter in loyalty to his wife, he is much more Hufflepuff than anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jess Mariano- **RAVENCLAW**

Jess craves knowledge, not education. When he is even in school, he decides not to pay attention because he has no faith in the intellect of those around him. Based only on where he is and what he has achieved by 6.18, Jess is clearly creative and stands with Truncheon, a company that values originality and individuality. Plus, it's true that Ravenclaws have the prettiest faces and...

His secondary house choice would also be Gryffindor, his main trait being the classic fault of the Gryffindors: bravery to the point of recklessness. He takes on an entire town, he pushes Rory to make decisions, and he moves cross-country multiple times at a very young age. His bravery isn't his main trait and it doesn't encompass who he turns into by the end.

Logan Huntzberger- **GRYFFINDOR**

 Any member of the Life and Death Brigade automatically qualifies to be a Gryffindor- are you kidding? Logan jumps into everything with both feet and when he want something, he will be damned if he doesn't give it his all. Often, he's controlled by his emotions and he doesn't think things through, which is what gets him in trouble. His bravery in trying to get away from his father's legacy and his need to throw himself into his career on his own terms is what eventually brings him to the place of cutting the umbilical cord between himself and his father by the end of the original series (which is also why I have such an issue with who he is in the revival!!!!!!!).",17,15,False,self,,,,,

I really loved this show, but Im starting to notice a different side of Lorelai thats making the show no longer watchable.

Lorelai is really self centered. This is most noticeable in her relationship with Max. She accepts Maxs proposal without ever considering how he would fit into her life, what their future together would be like. She makes the guy move to SH, but wouldnt even give the guy his own set of keys. Nothing was really changed in order to make the home feel like theirs, he was basically just moving into her house. Then she cancels the wedding deciding that he wasnt the one. Fast forward to next season and they kiss. He knows to stay away even though they have an undeniable attraction because DUH she already said he wasnt the one. Hes putting furniture in between them and she just keeps trying to close the distance between them, shes trying to convince him that they have something because they kissed, because they couldnt stay away from each other even after being on different coasts,  but HELLO did you forget you already decided the guy wasnt the one? Did you forget you canceled your wedding? Like how do you accept an engagement, cancel it and still think theres a possibility you should get back together. Theres no consideration for the other person and how this affects their life.

In her engagement with Luke, he waits patiently while she and Rory repair their relationship. Meanwhile when Luke needs time, she gives him an ultimatum and she doesnt even give him time to think about it. It had to be done right there in that moment. Her way. Hell if she had given him time instead of sleeping with Christopher that night, she would have gone to get married the next morning. 

Ive also found her to be a snob and just not a very nice person.

Theres this one part in the episode where shes asked to speak at Stars Hollow High because they consider her a business success. Shes on the phone and she asks the lady about her daughter so that the lady can brag and ramble on while she tells Rory about it and ponders how shes considered a success. Who does that?

What are your thoughts on Mia, her significance to the show, and if she was deserving of the devotion showed?

My personal thoughts- season 2 Mia was strange... her constant, dramatic exclamations that she couldnt understand Michele seemed so off-putting to me. I didnt get the joke, if there was one.
She apparently had known Michele before but now she cant understand him?

I have to wonder how close she was to the girls throughout the years of the show has she only makes two appearances that I could really think of. I understand her character is written as living on the opposite coast but I feel like for a character that supposedly has so much significance, she should have been peppered in a little bit more! At least referenced more or had a more significant story line.


The girls fondness for her- I get it. She seemed to have really been a saving grace to them, what with providing a job, shelter, and a sense of family. But as Ive read in other posts, she could have done more reasonable things like helped Lorelei forgive and reunite with Richard and Emily so Rory could be raised in a more suitable environment that a garden shed. I just dont care for Mia in general, I suppose.

- also when lorelai said were just friends (same mom same)
- she thought it was funny when sookie mentioned lorelai getting married to jackson that he got all freaked out (im not the romantic vegetable guy!!!)
- when richard was sulking at dinner because dean was there she went ooooo hes jealous
- later she realized that he doesnt want dean to get rory pregnant 
- she was baffled that lorelai unwrapped that many twinkies for her and rory (i was also there were like 15)
- we were laughing at the size of lanes suitcase (it could fit me and you, pull us everything we own and still have room to do souvenir shopping always gets me)

It's unhealthy, it's childish, it's vindictive, and it's a terrible, terrible way to deal with relationships to march in and basically say, ""Do what I want or else."" I understand that Luke made really stupid choices in the way he chose to handle the April situation, but instead of talking about it like an adult, Lorelai bottled up her feelings and put on a happy face until she exploded. I understand that she is afraid to lose Luke if she pushes him too hard--citing her parents' wedding and the aftermath as an excuse for keeping it all bottled up--but the problem the first time they broke up wasn't that Lorelai expressed emotions; it was that, when Luke asked for time to think, she wouldn't give it to him. That whole storyline was ridiculous; it wasn't three weeks of no discussion, it was literally twenty-four hours later and Lorelai wouldn't stop pestering him about it. Frankly, that break up was her own fault; I don't see that Luke had much blame in that situation. To use it as an excuse for failing to communicate in a healthy way with your fiance is bull crap. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also: I've always thought that part of Lorelai's frustration and anger with the April situation/Luke postponing their wedding wasn't a ""well, anybody would be frustrated in that situation"" kind of a thing (especially since Lorelai didn't even check with Luke before she chose the date and got everything together--she just went out, bought everything herself, came in and announced that they were getting married June 3 and expected Luke to just be okay with that). Rather, I think a huge part of Luke's appeal, to Lorelai, is that he puts her first. He always puts her first. He's a grumpy old bachelor whose only family obligation in the entire series (Jess) led to more fights between Luke and Lorelai than we had ever seen (including the infamous ""you have an obligation to this town and to me"" scene--in Lorelai's mind, Luke should always, always put her first, even before they were in a relationship). When she gets into a relationship with Luke, it's with the expectation that she'll be the center of his entire universe. Lorelai displays some serious narcissistic tendencies, and her absolute need to be the center of attention is one of those. When April comes into the picture, and suddenly Luke has another serious relationship in his life that doesn't revolve around her, she freaks out. I get that Luke handled it poorly, and Anna is horrible, and you need to introduce your fiance into your child's life at some point. I get all of that. But Lorelai basically only feels okay with the April thing during the birthday party scene--which was cute and fun and puts Lorelai exactly where she wants to be--front and center, the cool mom that all of the kids love. If she loses that, she's mad. If Luke doesn't ditch everything and come run away with her like they're besotted teenagers, they're over. I have very little sympathy for her in season 6, in spite of Luke's egregious mistakes, and I'm wondering if that was deliberate or if ASP just really didn't see how intensely selfish Lorelai is.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. I've wondered a lot if I don't like Lorelai because of the way she's written or the way she's portrayed or what (Lauren Graham is a marvelous actress and seems like a really lovely person, but there are certain lines of Lorelai's that could come across as sympathetic that just come across as extraordinarily bratty because of all the eye-rolling, arm crossing, deep sighing that she does when she's not getting her way).

I firmly believe that Rory and Jess were the best couple, and Im Team Jess all the way. But something has always upset me about how Dean is labeled as jealous and possessive. Yes he cheated on Lindsey with Rory, totally the worst. But, if you look at his character development, he was initially sweet and kind. Once Jess showed up things did change, but Rory started an emotional affair with Jess pretty quickly, and actually was kind of gaslighting Dean the whole way through. He was jealous of their connection, which was the right instinct. Rory kept saying about how he should stop being jealous and possessive, but she DID cheat and leave him for Jess! Thatd give anyone serious trust issues.

Again, he handled it badly, but he didnt outright say she couldnt see Jess, he was just upset because she kept lying and spending time with Jess behind his back (the tutoring and car accident, the night in with Jess and Paris). 

This doesnt excuse him cheating on Lindsey, but Rory was seriously toying with him emotionally. Calling him to pick her up from Yale when he was married, she decided she wanted him back once someone else had him. Even in AYITL, you can see again Rory saying you were the best boyfriend. Leave him alone Rory!!!

Rory was seriously manipulative to Dean so many times. Dean isnt without blame obviously, his marriage was his responsibility, but Rory was definitely throwing her weight around knowing he still had feelings for her. And I think when you watch it back you see how he was RIGHT to become jealous, Rory WAS cheating. He was possessive because he kept finding out she was sneaking around!

But other than that, we never see them work on their terrible communication skills. They havent discussed how they will once again address Lorelais relationship with April. They havent talked about the very different ways in which they each process big changes and life decisions. I dont doubt that they care deeply for one another and I believe they were still very much in love even post-breakup, but lack of love was never an issue for them.

There was something about the way Rory was behaving when she went to see Chris and the questions she was asking him about Lorelai raising her alone that struck me as potentially having a deeper meaning. 

In terms of characters in the show that Lorelai and Rory have dated, Chris and Logan are very similar. Assuming that Logan is the father I have no doubt that he would try and do what he thought to be the right thing, similar to Chris. However, from the questions Rory was asking Chris I think she would be similar to Lorelai and want to raise the baby on her own despite how much she wants to be with Logan.

Everyone knows about the famous opening scene where Luke disappears and Rory and Patty don't see him, but there's actually no good external evidence that he was ever there in the whole episode.

The second time we see him (fixing the roof), Rory doesn't seem aware he's there either.

Then Lorelai tells Rachel that ""he's just fixing some things... the porch rail, a couple roof shingles, then the porch rail again after he fell off the roof onto to the porch rail.""

Does it seem likely that Luke would fall off the roof and mysteriously break the porch rail again?  That's a strange story.

Then the final time he shows up to fix the back door it doesn't make sense either. Why would Luke break her back door and then go upstairs to do more work, when he supposedly already fixed the roof shingles upstairs?

Lorelai tells him to cease work on the ""Winchester mystery house here"".  The Winchester mystery house is famous for supposedly being haunted by ghosts, and the owner was an eccentric woman named Sarah Winchester who asked an architect to build her house oddly to accommodate her supernatural beliefs.

Does that imply that Lorelai is like Sarah Winchester, and simply imagining Luke fixing her house to deal with her emotional turmoil?  She is dealing with the issue that her and Max are dating again and she needs to make this public, in particular to tell Luke, who has his own problems with Rachel.

I think it more likely that Luke is actually avoiding both Rachel and Lorelai (using fixing Lorelai's house as an excuse for Rachel), and that Lorelai is imagining him there to help work through her emotional issues.",24,0,False,self,,,,,

Then, in his time at the Yale Daily News, he starts out as Doyles punching bag and evolves into Doyles nemesis with The NY Times picking up his article and his surprising list of media contacts who just wont leave him alone.

Almost every element is symbolic of Lorelais dilemma: Max or Luke.  

Michel and Sookies talk of ennui, a metaphysical angst, is precisely what Lorelai is experiencing.

The troudabours fighting over the town turf is symbolic of Lorelais dilemma.

The daisies represent her moving towards a decision at the end.

In the previous episode, Max ask Lorelai something crucial: I just want to know if there's a reason why you don't want people to know?  Essentially, he gives he an ultimatum to make their relationship public, which threatens to kill any nascent relationship with Luke.  That brings the conflict to the fore.

Now, people werent very enthusiastic about my [theory]( https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/c23pxn/i_think_lorelai_did_hallucinate_luke_fixing_her/) about Luke fixing Lorelais house, but I believe I didnt provide appropriate context.

And I have a question for the skeptics: Why does Luke come to the town meeting and leave Rachel running the diner?  Lorelai just got through telling Luke that he **needs** to spend time with her, and to give this situation a fair chance.  

My answer is that this conversation never happened, it was all in Lorelais head.  When Luke shows up at the town hall meeting and Lorelai agrees that he should go back to Rachel, thats the first time she ever told him.  He takes this as permission to go to Rachel, though she ends up breaking up with him.

Just one small clue that the conversation in Lorelais kitchen isnt real: Lorelai tells Luke that cookies almost never make it out of the car, and proceeds to get straight up and grab a box of Nilla cookies out of the cupboard.

After Max proposes with the daisies, the troubadours reconcile and perform together, the conflict is resolved for now.  And Lorelai gives Luke a daisy, to symbolize that she has come to a decision to consider Maxs proposal.

I hope you enjoy this post, we were able to watch quite a few today (because its summer so we arent as busy as usual). If you have any questions for my mom and I, leave a comment below!

2x04 (Road Trip to Harvard)
- when the radio said hootie and the blowfish and the girls were like ewww, my mom said YES, i love hootie
- she laughed at Ledons dress (that women is obsessed with flowers)
- she thought the line we are above everyone else on the planet was funny 
- she liked when lorelai wrote in the guest book (satanic rituals are at work here)
- we were laughing because we could both see my grandma being apart of the BNB group birdwatching and stuff (she once texted my brother a long paragraph about the bee hummingbird for no reason so we had a good laugh)
- she liked kirk and lukes welcome to france bit (she also thought it was cute how luke was so happy to hear that lorelai was available again, if only she knew how long it was actually going to take them)
- she also thought it was funny when that guy was flirting with lorelai (and how rory was laughing about it)
- she likes to point out all of the older stuff from the early 2000s (the older computers, pay phones, etc.)
- my mom started getting emotional because she doesnt want to think about when I go to college (a few months ago i toured a college with her and i was able to sit in on a class, and so that entire scene was something that hit hard for me and my mom because we could really see ourselves in rory and lorelai)
- she liked the moment between lorelai and emily with the present (sad that we never find out what she got her)
- we accidentally talked through the entire scene with luke and lorelai talking about everything so i dont have anything on that (we were trying to figure out why lorelai was staring at that random picture of that girl at harvard)

2x05 (Nick/Nora, Sid/Nancy)
- she liked the line okay round 2 
- when jess came on screen she was like oh hello (she has a thing for the danes men i think, i have a thing for the gilmore girls plus jess bc he is hot)
- my brother was in the back and he actually laughed at the line this is stars hallow you take three left turns and youre back in the center of town. (he didnt stay to watch he is not into the show haha)
- she laughed when luke said rory had a tighter grasp on reality than lorelai 
- she thought it was funny when sookie was making all that food (also jackson and the lemon)
- she liked/hated the scene with jess and lorelai (i also like how lorelai reacts when he says are you sleeping with him or something she thought he was being rude, but thought that line was kinda funny)
- she loved the scene when jess was pushed into the lake (one of the best scenes in the show)
- she is wondering where dean is
- her thoughts on jess were he doesnt look like he is in high school. and he has a big old chip on his shoulder, its annoying (im excited to see her thoughts on jess as the series moves along)
- her final thoughts on the episode were, deans gonna come back in and be all jealous

2x06 (Presenting Lorelai Gilmore)
- my mom was very invested in the DAR groups gossip (the salsberry concubine)
- my mom laughed at the suggestion of the debutante ball (she didnt know that they still did those)
- one of my friends was actually an escort at a debutante ball so this episode always makes me laugh (he actually had to rehearse for months before, so its kinda odd to me that it only took rory and dean 3 days to learn everything)
- my mom asked did get fired when richard was at home
- my mom forgot that rorys real name was lorelai and was like how did they get rory from lorelai 
- she was really confused on why emily said nothing is turning out the way its supposed to she thought she was being over dramatic 
- she laughed at the fan dance
- when chris revealed he had a girlfriend my mom was like called it
- she likes the town troubadours songs 
- shes glad that chris has a girlfriend because she thinks that relationship would have been awkward (shes going to looooooove season 7)

The most obvious one, of course, is Lorelai's biological parents vs. her ""family"" of Mia and everyone in Stars Hollow.  And, as the show continues, then, on the biological side is Christopher and on the blended side is Luke.  


But the show can't figure out how to have people learn to love each other as family and not constantly be in competition for ""the right one"".  Gigi is Rory's little sister.  She is Rory's family.  And, by extension, she is Lorelai's family.  And so is Christopher.  It doesn't matter whether Lorelai marries him or not -- they are family forever.    


But Luke is a meaningful member of Lorelai's family, too.  He's there for her every time she needs money (she borrows money in season one, and then $30k for the inn, and then he invests thousands in her house -- at no time does she ever pay him back even $1).  In fact, Luke never even charges Lorelai for food, let alone for the life-giving coffee.  And he shows up when her dad is in the hospital, because he is family.  It's the same instantaneous gut reaction as when he takes in Jess, and as when he wants to parent April.

Here's the full quote below because I honestly couldn't put it better into words.

&gt;I'm disappointed more hasn't been discussed about the diner scene. I think beyond encapsulating how rich the characterization of Lorelai is and by extension Lauren Graham's performance, it serves to me as \*the\* example for why Luke and Lorelai work so well. The best friends that are always sort of the verge of being together without feeling cloyingand forced. They have their ups and downs but to me the relationships works so well because for the first four years, it's socomfortable with whatever direction it might take the characters that it doesn't really upset the audience if they do or don't become a couple because it's such a wonderful, strong pleasant to watchfriendship at its core. And as we see in this episode, even when things are shitty, they're going to be there for that person when they really need it.

Their kids are super brainy and love to read, they love to write, and they love to talk about deep and complex subjects. Plus, neither of them are fantastic at flirting.

&amp;#x200B;

Liz was a foil of Lorelai (sort of). She is the Lorelai that went without and the Lorelai that didn't put in the effort:

Lorelai had Emily and Richard, two people that were not going to let Lorelai fall off the map, Liz had a younger brother and a dad that resigned to saying that 'it's just what Liz does'. 

Christopher at least called once a week, saw Rory on holidays and special events. Jimmy was never really in the picture. From the two conflicting bits of info we get (""You were gonna go out and buy some diapers.... but you never came back"" and ""left her about two years ago, whereabouts unknown"") I tend to think of Jimmy as having stopped being a father when Jess was an infant, and falling completely off the map two years before we see Jess (when he was 15). Maybe Jimmy sent birthday cards from California or something, but he wasn't in Jess's life long enough for Jess to not recognize him.

Lorelai left the house as soon as she could and begged for a job. She worked her way up from the ground and bought a house for herself and her baby. Liz didn't do any of that.

Liz constantly had a new boyfriend that she chose over her son and that changed her personality and the way she lived. Lorelai didn't let a single man into her home.

Lorelai and Rory are best friends. Jess can't trust his mother with anything. 

Lorelai and Rory take care of each other, Jess takes care of his mother.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to saying that if Jess was given what Rory had, he would have been as good (if not better!) than Rory. He wrote a book at 20-ish years old that was published and sold. Rory dropped out of Yale. 

This is not to say that I don't adore Rory, though I know many don't, because I do! I love her! I just think that people should remember that Jess had a lot more to deal with and he was 18 or younger in the show.

(A couple of scenes before Rory and Logan are talking on the phone and he tell her he loves her, and I felt like it was uncomfortable to her to say it back ?). 

I crack up imagining how they came up with the song. Richard was definitely the one to suggest it. Emily probably said no at the beginning, but then Richard convinced her. She then hires a pianist, a singing coach and a lyricist... Too funny.",4,47,False,self,,,,,

&gt;LORELAI: Luke, what happened today?  
&gt;  
&gt;LUKE: Today I found out what a big, dumb, idiot guy I am. Just an imposing, judgmental know-it-all who blows around yelling and complaining and screwing up everybody else's life.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: I hardly think you're--  
&gt;  
&gt;LUKE: I'm dumb. Yeah, not like Jess. Jess is smart. You know, he doesn't care about anybody else's life. He just takes care of himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;LORELAI: Did you and Jess have a thing?  
&gt;  
&gt;LUKE: He informed me that I am nothing but an unwelcome burden to everyone around me.

Later on, she yells at Jess for hurting Luke's feelings -- ""a man who has done nothing but support you and try to help you"" she says. I've seen people cite this as evidence of Lorelai's lack of boundaries when it comes to teenagers. Now this is a take-away that I generally agree with -- let us all remember how she went to Dean's place of work in Season 1 to tell him he was scum after he and Rory broke up  -- but in this particular scene, I thought it was warranted given what a jerk Jess had been to Luke prior to this. Now was Luke the sole catalyst for her belligerence? Probably not (Jess' failed relationship with Rory comes to mind, which, ya know, Jess points out). But I doubt Lorelai would've approached him at all if his words hadn't affected Luke so badly in the first place.

What do you think? Was Lorelai out of line? Was she in the right for wanting to protect her friend?",1,5,False,self,,,,,
