Lorelai is upset because she specifically asked Sookie to take an hour off from mommy duty to do this one thing, which would allow her to get her hair done, while Sookie is upset that Lorelai wont accept her apology and blames her forgetfulness on having a new baby. 

Who do you side with? I completely agree that Sookie should have been at the inn at that time since she agreed to it. However, Lorelai yells at Sookie for not attending any meetings over the past two months. Sookie just had a baby and if she had a normal job, its possible she would still be on maternity leave.  Jackson doesnt seem to be home during the fight, indicating that hes out at work, which mean Sookie is the one responsible for staying home and taking care of the baby. I understand that Lorelai is overwhelmed, but she needs to cut Sookie some slack. 

And earlier that episode, Sookie finds out they are having money problems with the inn, something Lorelai was obviously keeping from her.  Had Lorelai wanted Sookie to be more involved, she should have told her about the money problems sooner.

It is a staple in my childhood. 

Im rewatching again and Im starting to notice more and more how selfish Rory is and how she typically never actually gets called out for it. 

The first real example is when Lorelai graduates business school. What does Rory do? Sneaks off to see Jess and misses the ceremony. Then when having to face Lorelai she cries and self punishes.. and Lorelai makes no comment other than she wants to go eat and celebrate. 

The second is when Lorelai opens the Dragonfly and Rory sleeps with dean. Leading her and Lorelai into months of not speaking all well the dragonflys an new business and Lorelai cant enjoy it because of the rift. Another achievement diminished by her actions. Which also by the way received no guilt trip. 

The last one I really can point out is Richard and Emilys wedding vowel renewal. She leaves in the middle to go be with Logan. Lorelai catches her and even tells her what are you doing?.. God Rory I swear had they not been charged at  by Chris then maybe she wouldve been told how incredibly selfish she was being.. but it is still an example of how Rory never considers the  consequences her going after what she wants or feels takes away from others and their moments.",13,21,False,self,,,,,
14,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2019-5-2,2019,5,2,13,bjqrhy,self.GilmoreGirls,Is Season 4 Rory Depressed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/bjqrhy/is_season_4_rory_depressed/,CharleneRobertaMcGee,1556770704,"Every time I watch Season 4 (my favorite season), it strikes me that Rory is probably dealing with (or rather not dealing with) depression that never really gets addressed. 

Let's take stock here. At the beginning of Season 4, Rory has just broken up with Jess, which wasn't really a breakup, but more of a glorified ghosting. She went from being in a relationship with someone she loved / considering having sex and then lost him overnight with barely any explanation. And all of this went down on the eve of her high school graduation. So, a lot of change at once. 

Then she starts college, which is a big, potentially traumatic change at the best of times--and this is an extremely sheltered girl who is ""freakishly linked"" with her mom. Naturally, she has trouble adjusting. 

You don't ask your mom to spend your first night at college with you if you're emotionally ready to move out. And I don't care how cool Lorelai is, I think she would have been socially flayed by that in real life. 

For the first time, she finds herself struggling romantically. After not being without a boyfriend for three years, she has a string of disappointing experiences with guys. As Lorelai says, guys were always just sort of ""there,"" for Rory. And now she's got to hunt a little, after being the center of two guys' attention for YEARS. Meanwhile, Paris starts sleeping with a professor and seemingly everyone under the sun at Yale finds a partner while she doesn't. 

In the midst of all this, her first love gets married. Put a pin in THAT.

Also, for the first time since Season 1, she really struggles academically. It might not seem like a big deal, but I think she took being told to drop a class VERY hard. Harder than we see. 

Basically, things aren't as easy at Yale as they have been. It's not unusual for kids who have put all their energy and focus into getting into college to then flounder when they get there. Because what now?

On top of this, I don't think it should be discounted what a loss it might have been for Rory to not have the Independence Inn anymore. It was, after all, her early childhood home. Now it's just another thing she's lost. 

Then...Jess comes back out of the blue and tells her he loves her and asks her to run away with him. Just when she's probably started really getting over him. So, she loses him all over again. 

Nothing excuses her sleeping with a married man, but in this context, I can see how Rory ended up in bed with Dean. She was hurting, she was vulnerable, and Dean was there and familiar. It was all too easy to pretend she was sixteen again and everything was easy. As she says to Lane, her disappointment and heartbreak with Jess (plus all the rest of the change she's going through) has led to some real regret about Dean. It was a bad, selfish decision to sleep with him, but not that surprising considering the year she's had.",31,218,False,self,,,,,

Then they drunkenly get married, both regret it, but instead of divorcing they decide to stay together and (sort of) move in together all the while Luke is still very obviously in love with Lorelai and Nicole always appears to be vaguely aware of this.

The weidest thing, however, was the way ASP decided to break them up. I mean the obvious move would have been for Luke to realize that he had always wanted Lorelai and end the relationship with Nicole. But instead Nicole's cheating is the cause for their divorce.

Its actually pretty likely that those berets are the only black head coverings Lorelai and Rory would own, since Rory never really wears hats and Lorelais hats are usually more bold/whimsical, which would be pretty inappropriate for a funeral.

I did like him with Rory, but he was one of my favorite people in the show overall because of his character development.

When he comes to Stars Hollow in season 2, hes an angry and unruly kid. Between befriending Rory while she was with Dean, having to go back to New York and then coming back, he didnt exactly have a ton of shining moments. Especially with Luke. Luke only wanted the best for him and Jess was still a jerk to him for the most part.

Over the years, he seemed to grow but still a little lost. Between telling Rory he loved her and running away to begging her to run away with him, he had some stuff to work out. He went to California to get to know his dad. He came back to New York. He did end up making improvements though - he showed up to his Moms wedding and finally thanked Luke for everything he tried to do for him.

Fast forward to season 6: Jess visits Rory to show her the book he wrote and tells her he couldnt have done it without her.  Hes clearly matured, cleaned himself and found what he wanted to be when he grew up. He also called Rory out on quitting Yale, her rocky relationship with Logan and was able to ask her what no one else would: *what is going on with you*?

It was so great to finally see a character who changed for the better. Then, when Rory (And Luke and April at the same time) goes to see him at his printing press in Philadelphia, we finally see Jess truly grown up. Gone is the mouthy, unruly, angry kid and he had evolved into the guy I think we all knew he could be. He has a job he's passionate about in a new city, ends up paying back Luke for everything (be still, my heart) and when Rory kissed him and led him on and then stopped to tell him she was still with Logan, Jess sticks him for himself. It wasn't fair to him for Rory to show up and act like that, but Jess handled it so maturely. We see him come, as the title of my post suggests - **full circle.** 

I think the reason why I want to point this out is because while I love Rory and Lorelai (even when they drive me crazy) and other characters in the show, but so few of them actually change and grow throughout the series. Lorelai is still stubborn, Rory still spoiled at times, etc. Jess however, did change. 

TL/DR: I am SO glad they showed him off and on over the years and his progression. As many viewers feel, the 6th and 7th seasons fell flat compared to the rest of the show. The episode when Luke and April and Rory visit him though is a shining moment and one of my favorite parts of the entire series.",19,79,False,self,,,,,

I wonder if perhaps theres some subtext that Dean and Lindsay were trying for a baby? If Lindsay planned on being pregnant in the first year of their marriage, that may be a reason for her not to be looking for a job. Theres the conversations about a townhouse (more space for a family), a new car (similar to Christophers Volvo and Sookie/Jackson wanting to buy a safer car for Davey). Lindsays mom makes the comment about not waiting to long to teach your little one to cook. Obviously, individually this could all just be coincidence and not be pointing in that direction but it does make me wonder.

Let's be honest, most of us have parents that don't approve of our significant others and wonder why we didn't get with ""that other boyfriend/girlfriend."" Lorelai wanted Rory to stay with Dean, Trix wanted Richard to stay with Pennilyn. It was no surprise to Luke that Emily thought he was beneath Lorelai and thought that her daughter deserved someone with ""breeding"", much like Chris. 

I re-watched the Wedding Bell Blues episode and realized that Lorelai was really in the wrong for having a late night drink with Chris and not mentioning it. (not wrong for consoling a friend, wrong for not mentioning it) If I was Luke, I would have felt extremely ""shanghai-ed"" as well. Lorelai showed a complete disregard for his feelings. Earlier in the series, she stands up Luke (painting date) to sleep with Chris. Chris and Lorelai are openly dating at Sookie's wedding, and Lorelai all but names him when she is heartbroken at the diner in the ""Mimi"" bit. Chris is not just the father of her child, he's a RECENT ex. How would Lorelai have felt if Luke went to Nicole's house at night with Tequila and ""forgot"" to mention it until they ran into her, very obviously hiding it and giving the illusion that something more than drinks happened?

Luke had even tried to tell Lor that he was okay with her having a friendship with Chris (Just a few episodes before, when Chris and Lor had lunch at the inn). Poor Luke was trying hard to convince himself that they were friends, nothing more. 

Granted, Emily didn't help. But to say that she ""broke them up"" is a gross exaggeration, when if Lorelai was upfront, Luke would've been mad but gotten over Chris' declaration of love. 

As a side note, I actually thought that Emily going to the diner to talk Luke into reconciling was a lovely moment. Many of us have parents who were against us dating/marrying significant others. Most of us who do don't have an Emily and Luke moment of acknowledgement where the rude parent apologizes for interfering and acknowledges that they do not always know what's best for their child.",34,65,False,self,,,,,

Lorelei was sixteen when Rory was born and we get the idea that she still had a lot of growing up to do. But she was prevented from a lot of the growth that happens when you go off to college and gradually learn how to be on your own as an adult. Instead, she suddenly had to learn to care for an infant and survive on her own in the world all at once. And I think because of this, she essentially raised Rory to be the best friend she wanted as a sixteen year old. So it makes sense to me that Rory does a lot of dumb shit, like sleeping with a married Dean, stealing a yacht, stringing Dean along when she really wanted to be with Jess, etc. because she was raised by a person who emotionally was still a teenager. I think Rorys grandparents, Lorelei, and the town of Stars Hollow are equating Rorys aptitude for school and reading for maturity when that is really not the case at all.",20,39,False,self,,,,,

Next, he grabs her arm and practically drags her to his car, then proceeds to blame her for the accident. Im sorry, are we supposed to think this is romantic??

 Usually I don't sympathise with Logan, but this time I am with him. He is ready for the next step while Rory is not, and it should be a step both partners want. It's also kind of naive of Rory that he would stay with her even after declining his proposal. However perhaps his chances would have been better if he discussed it with her before, at least trying to figure out how realistic the chances are. However as we can see from his personal and professional life he is a risk taker full and full. Which is also why he crashes onto his nose more times than others.

DISCLAIMER: This isnt meant to make a judgement on whether anyone should or shouldnt have kids. Its absolutely none of my business. Im just following what seemed like likely and unlikely family outcomes by the show, given the characters backgrounds, personalities and motivations in life. 

Rory: Understandable- The product of a teen pregnancy by a single mother who was very determined to live independently from her parents. Lorelei didnt have time to date and being single mom (that lived on a limited income for many years) is tough. 

Lorelei: Puzzling- The daughter of wealthy parents who presumably married relatively young. Both Richard and Emily seem to take a great interest in raising young people, as well as planning all the rituals and ceremonies involving kids in their moneyed world. 

Richard: Puzzling - Again, like Lorelei, Richards parents had no economic barriers discouraging them from having multiple children. They also came from a generation where larger families were more common and women were expected to be homemakers.

Paris: Understandable - Her parents showed no interest in raising children. Also they probably didnt like each other enough to procreate. 

Jess: Understandable - His mother seemed to need time to get a few things together and Jess was probably quite a handful to begin with. 

Sookie: Unclear - Dont recall a lot about her backstory, but we never see any other St James siblings. 

Lane: Very puzzling- As a member of a very traditional Korean family, youd think Mr. and Mrs. Kim would greatly value progeny. 

Kirk: Understandable- I completely get it. One kid like Kirk was probably enough for his parents.",49,79,False,self,,,,,

**Jess was a street magician back in NY. **

We don't know what Jess was doing before coming to Stars Hallow. All Luke said was Liz was saying he was skipping school and getting into trouble. We don't know what kind of trouble, we don't even know if he got in any actual trouble, it can just be a figure of speech. Let's face it, Jess was not a criminal. He stole a gnome. Drew a chalk outline on the ground. He smoked but we didn't see him drink or do drugs. It was all an act. 

The worst thing he did was skip school. He'd skip but then what. What would he do all day.  He didn't have any money. His mom wasn't going to let him have a job and no one is going to illegally hire a 16 year old. How else is he going to make money legally (although you probably need a permit for street perfornance). So Jess started turning G-rated tricks on the street. It's literally a stereotype from a movie, which makes it perfect for Gilmore Girls.

The first, is after Lorelai hides her engagement to Max and they have the big blow-up fight. Lorelai comes back the next day, or perhaps a few days later, and calmly explains herself. She essentially says that she was so happy about the news, and she didn't share it with Emily because she wanted to keep being happy. And, in the past, whenever she has shared news with her mother, Emily always finds a way to make her feel bad or guilty about it. So this time, she doesn't share her happy news with Emily because she wants to just keep being happy. The unspoken implication here is that she knew that Emily would ruin the news for her by making her feel bad about it, as she always does.

Then, in season two, Richard quits his job and doesn't tell Emily. The night of the Bracebridge dinner, she expresses how hurt she is that he wouldn't share this with her. And he explains to her that he knows that Emily likes things to be planned, and safe, and that he knew his decision was rash and impulsive. But, he was so happy about the decision, that he just wanted to keep being happy about it. He doesn't tell her because he doesn't want her to be disappointed and to bring him back down to reality. The same unspoken implication is here: Richard doesn't tell Emily because he thinks she would ruin the news for him by making him feel bad about it.

The situations are different -- Lorelai thinks Emily will ruin the news by being harsh and judgemental, and Richard thinks she will effectively ruin his news by being pragmatic and quietly disappointed -- but also quite similar in the ultimate ""moral of the story"" which is that Emily's two closest family members don't want to share happy news with Emily because they think she will ruin it and make them feel bad about it.

I'm not saying that both Lorelai and Richard aren't justified (personally, I think Lorelai is 100% justified based on what we've seen and what we later see; Richard, however, I think is less so -- Emily is very supportive of Richard and seems really to only have his happiness in mind throughout the whole series). But, I do feel for Emily in this moment. That must be really difficult to hear twice in such a short period of time. 

There's a small emotion on Emily's face when Richard explains his reasoning to her that I have always interpreted as a moment of recognition -- like, she's recalling the similar moment that she had with Lorelai not too long ago, and realizes that the situation has, in a sense, been repeated. I could be imagining that, but I do think Kelly Bishop's face has just an extremely complex range of emotions in that scene, and I think it's one of her strongest-acted scenes for that reason.

Anyway, I've been thinking about this a bit, especially in the context of season two. Some of the episodes where we see Emily reaching out to Lorelai the most (""Secrets and Loans,"" ""There's the Rub,"" and ""Lorelai's Graduation Day"") follow soon after. It's interesting to think that perhaps that moment with Richard could have led Emily to a small realization about how she might be isolating her family members.",11,126,False,self,,,,,

I also thought that Emily was a bit over dramatic in her reaction.  I mean I understand feeling a little hurt that she heard the news from Sookie first but did she stop to think that Lorelai wanted to tell her parents and was going to tell them, but was waiting until the right time or maybe Max and Lorelai wanted to enjoy being engaged for a little bit before they announced it?

For me, it's like this:

**The Bad:**
1. The Stars Hollow musical production sapped away *so* much time, and while it was kind of funny and pieces of it drove the plot minimally, all I could think was how many better uses there would've been for that huge block of time.

2. Sookie just left the inn? *Really?* It seemed totally out of character since this was their dream and she loved it, it made me depressed for Lorelai that she didn't have her best friend there, and upset me since Sookie is one of my absolute favorite characters, if not the top of that list. 

3. I hated that Rory still didn't end up with anyone, or even happy. She was a side-girl with no one who really cared enough about her, and at the end, it felt like the launch of a whole new season or mini series. I was disappointed to be left reeling instead of feeling warm and fuzzy and nostalgic at the end.

4. Luke and Lorelai. I almost felt that Luke lost some of his strength as a character. Instead of feeling separate and Luke-like, he felt like an add-on in the plot, almost, that existed solely for Lorelai whenever she chose to want him. That hurt because I always loved his independent spunk. Also, the fact that in 10 years they never got married (or even engaged???) and never talked about wanting kids is total bull.


**The Good:**
1. I love Jess! To be honest, I still don't want him with Rory romantically just because I don't like their fit, but I do really like him as a person - especially how helpful he was for Luke, and even as a friend to Rory. I always disliked him as a person before, so this is nice.

2. Kirk is still...Kirk. and Taylor is still Taylor. The whole town is really virtually the same, and I think I needed that to be true.

3. Paris. I've always loved her, but I super adore adult, businesswoman Paris. Her talking to the kids at Chilton and then her immediate bathroom breakdown over Tristan made me die laughing, and I loved it. Also, I love her hair, and I'm amused that she has kids she seems to really care about.

4. The, ""How long has it been?"" ""Feels like years!"" at the very beginning when Lorelai and Rory hug made me tear up - and I have chills while I'm typing this! Just perfect.

5. Emily's character development. getting along with possibly the worst (best?) housekeeping setup she's ever had. This was nice character development, and I'm glad she ended up with someone there who I felt like was really taking care of her, especially with Richard gone. Her absolutely destroying the DAR. She WORE A T-SHIRT. And her call when Lorelai told her the real story about memories of Richard. Best thing ever.

6. Luke and Lorelai finally got married. It should've happened sooner, but it *happened,* and I'm happy about it. All the twinkle lights were great, and I'm happy they're happy. Maybe now they can have a baby! Just gotta call Paris. Haha!",37,12,False,self,,,,,

I am a little confused regarding the timeline that spans through the first season relating to Rory's age. In the very first episode, when the stranger at Luke's approaches Lorelai and Rory's table, and insinuates that he has a friend to join them, Lorelai quickly says ""she's 16"". Additionally, in the episode where a deer hits Rory's car, she is driving alone, and thus she would have to be 16. 

Then Rory has a birthday in season 1, episode 6, which implies that she would now be 17. 

However, in season 1, episode 13 where Rory, Paris, Madeline, and Louise work on their debate, and then go see the bangles, they all remark how they are 16.

I get it. Thats probably the reason she didnt want to have them married somewhere in that 10 years period and have a flash back or a vow renewal in the revival.

So she decides to have them eloped. Dude, can we get a real wedding since we waited so long? 
Ok, I get that Melissa was probably impossible to get to come back to the set( we know she would be there for a big wedding). I also read somewhere that it was a budget thing why they couldnt get a fancy big wedding. Get it. Logistics check out- she makes them elope. So only Stars Hollow people attend. 
But, she explains how Sookie and Emily are far away, so they dont come.

Why on the earth didnt she bring April back for the wedding? The actress was probably available. I get it, no explanation was needed cause she doesnt live around but come on

Recreate the scene from R&amp;E vow revival and have April be Lukes best man in a tuxedo like Rory was at the her grandparents. 

Would be amazing.
