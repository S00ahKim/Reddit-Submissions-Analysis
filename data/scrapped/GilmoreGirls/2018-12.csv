Here they are:

-When Chris and Lorelai demonstrate the waltz for Rory and Dean. Not a fan of Chris, but he and Lorelai have undeniable chemistry.

-Pregnant Sookie coming to Lorelai's house to freak out about Davey not being born yet. Particularly: ""He can't find his way out of my sandpaper innards!""

-Michel rolls ""Truman"" under the bed

-When Rory wants to skip FND for her three-month anniversary with Dean, and Lorelai imitates Emily's reaction. ""Hold on, I'm going to cartwheel.""

-Rory and Logan's dance at the vow renewal. Mostly I love this because it's one long rotating take and Rory looks stunning, even in her suit.

-When Lorelai, Sookie, and Michel return to the inn after finding out their new street name: Sores and Boils Alley. Also, same episode, when Lorelai tells them that Taylor patted her on the head ""like a dog.""

-Thanksgiving at Sookie's house. ""Am I laughing or crying?"" ""Laughing."" ""Good!""

-Emily telling off Shira Huntzberger at the DAR function.

-When Lorelai comes to the diner after she and Max? (I think?) break up and she tells Luke how much she wants a partner.

-Lorelai breaks up with Chris for the last time. I relate so much to her speech.

-Controversial, but I love when Lorelai sings to Luke. It becomes such an intimate moment between them, I always choke up a little bit.

-There's a moment at FND when Lorelai asks Richard, ""Can you thermidor other foods?"" and she gives him this wink and a smile that reads to me like a moment between Lauren and Ed, not Lorelai and Richard.

She returns to Chris because he is familiar and she doesn't have to explain anything to him. 

She and Luke worked well in the beginning because he was such a solid, routine part of her life, and she knew she could count on him.

44,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2018-12-5,2018,12,5,2,a32nvf,self.GilmoreGirls,Why Gilmore Girls reference heavy style is the best out there (NO SPOILERS),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/a32nvf/why_gilmore_girls_reference_heavy_style_is_the/,isthiscleverr,1543943771,"(Perhaps minor Riverdale spoilers) 

So over the last decade or so, at least in my experience of the shows I watch, its become way more common for dialogue to be heavy with pop culture references. None to the degree that GG does it, of course, but its definitely much more common from what I can tell. And Ive never been able to put my finger on why GG does it so much better than any other show  even shows I love that have that style  until last night. 

Husband and I are watching Riverdale (which is pretty compelling despite the teen melodrama), in which all the teen characters pepper their dialogue with usually awkwardly delivered pop culture references. Anyway, at some point, Toni tells Jughead that his girlfriend isnt what she expected. Jughead asks, What were you expecting? And Toni responds, I dont know. Winona Ryder from Beetlejuice. It was an apt reference, sure, but it didnt land right (like a lot of their references, honestly), and it finally clicked for me why. 

It would have been more succinct and more fitting for her to respond Lydia Deets instead of Winona Ryder from Beetlejuice. The problem is not everyone watching Riverdale  likely heavily concentrated into teen and preteen viewers  would understand that reference. Even if theyve seen the movie, they may not immediately grasp who that character is. But, because of Stranger Things, most of these viewers likely know Winona Ryders name. So that way, even if they dont know who this character is, its easy enough to google Winona Ryder Beetlejuice. You could argue they could also google Lydia Deets, but that would depend on them picking up on the name and remembering it/recognizing it enough to be able to google, as well as them being invested enough in finding out to actually google it rather than blowing off the reference they dont get.

And thats what it comes down to: if a viewer doesnt get the references, it wont be funny/poignant/meaningful/etc. to them. If thats the case, they wont enjoy the show and characters as much, which could lead to people not watching the show. 

Which boils down to why GG is the best reference-heavy dialogue style out there: *GG doesnt care if you understand every reference.* Its been talked about how most viewers dont understand half of what gets bandied around in the show, but viewers dont care. The point isnt to know exactly what every reference means; its to understand the references that you understand while informing you about who these characters are. And while it may not have been intended this way, its also survived and thrived for so long because, as viewers grow and experience more things, you come back to the show with new understandings and appreciation of some of the references that may have gone completely over your head before. Its something new to discover every time you watch. 

Other shows struggle so much more with this style of dialogue because they do care if viewers understand every reference or not. So theres fewer shows that really go hard on the culture references, and even reference-heavy shows (like Riverdale, which tends to use characters references to indicate how young, cool, and smart they are) never quite hit the casual reference-dropping game right. 

Anyway, just thought Id share. Happy Tuesday, everyone. :) ",60,1,False,self,,,,,
45,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2018-12-5,2018,12,5,7,a35wum,self.GilmoreGirls,Theory about Anna freakout,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/a35wum/theory_about_anna_freakout/,isthiscleverr,1543963957,"I know a lot of people here hate April at least partially because she ruined Luke and Lorelai, but I've always been of the mindset that that was really Anna's fault. I just finished the episode with April's birthday party, and there' s a couple things to note there:

\- Immediately after Luke admits that he's keeping Lorelai and April apart because he's afraid that April will like Lorelai better, the birthday party starts with Anna telling him that April and all her friends LOVE him, call him Hagrid, think he's just the best. Essentially negating or playing down any fears that they won't like him. 

\- April makes the comment directly at the party that Lorelai reminds her of her mom and that the two adults would probably get along. 

\- Lorelai obviously feels immensely better after the party as she believes that this is the beginning of their lives getting to a more normal place. 

\- Anna storms in and yells at Luke for leaving all the girls alone with a woman she'd never met, that she can't explain that to the other parents, that it was unthinkable that he would do that. 

\- Lorelai approaches Anna afterward afterwards to apologize and introduce herself so that Anna wouldn't have that problem anymore, to which Anna responds that she doesn't want Lorelai in April's life because she and Luke could break up, which would hurt April -- a completely different reason than she gave Luke.

So my theory is that Anna, at least initially, is not angry so much at Luke for bringing in Lorelai, but may be actually jealous of Lorelai herself. It would parallel nicely to the insecurities Luke had about Lorelai and April meeting in an even more applicable way: two quirky, funky women in mother/mother-like roles. Maybe when April came home and began telling her mom all about Lorelai and the party she threw, maybe she felt threatened by Lorelai's presence in April's life. A few notes to expand on this:

\- Many people have commented on this sub that Anna's behavior, especially in this instance but overall as well, seems totally unreasonable. Particularly that the woman who would let her daughter traipse around different towns on her bicycle, who would let her pursue a DNA/""find my father"" science project, would be so bent out of shape that Luke's very serious partner helped with the party. 

\- She calls Lorelai the ""girlfriend"" when yelling at him. Maybe April told her wrong. Maybe she just said the wrong word. Or maybe she is downplaying the relationship to make her anger seem more just. 

\- All the girls called their parents to check that a sleepover was okay. And sexist as it may be, most parents of teenage girls would probably rather a woman as the overnight chaperone than the man. Plus, did not a single parent ask ""Well is Luke the chaperone?"" Did not a single girl mention that ""April's dad's girlfriend/wife/fiancee"" took them all to get makeovers? 

\- Anna implied in the yelling that, because she could vouch for Luke to the other parents, that letting Lorelai (for whom she couldn't vouch) run the party was inexcusable because she can't tell the other parents that she's a good person or safe or whathaveyou. But this isn't the explanation she gives Lorelai when Lorelai goes to see Anna. Anna tells her that April isn't to meet the men in her life (and the women in Luke's) until very late in the game. If the issue was really that Anna felt betrayed that Luke let someone she didn't know run the party, why wasn't that what she told Lorelai? Why didn't she say, ""I'm sure you're wonderful, but I was responsible for those girls with their parents, and I wish I'd known that you would have been in charge. I felt blindsided and uncomfortable that I'd made the other parents uncomfortable""? Because to me, it isn't ridiculous that a parent would want to know if some other adult was in charge of her kids or the other kids; it is ridiculous that she berated Luke for this, then changed her story when Lorelai showed up. 

\- We of course know that Lorelai had a similar rule about Rory meeting her men, and we saw how that panned out with Max to an extent. So the rule alone isn't necessarily out of universe or hard to believe. But Anna telling her, ""You're engaged, everyone can get engaged,"" as a reason for her continued discomfort with Lorelai is. She didn't even make the comment that once they were married, she'd be fine with it. Maybe she's just being ridiculously overprotective, or perhaps she's hoping to keep April and Lorelai apart for as long as she can to avoid any kind of competition or comparison.

\- Anna also mentions at this meeting that she's nervous at how attached April is getting to Luke. I think this could be another clue to her jealousy: April is already growing attached to her second parent, so what if there's a whole couple -- a mother and father figure set -- that she would have to compete with? We know from Lorelai's comments here and there (as well as some common sense) that there's a certain insecurity that comes with being a single parent and not being able to give your child a two-parent home. So what if she's worried that Luke and Lorelai represent something she can never give to April? Or at least not right then?

So like I said, I don't necessarily think it's ridiculous for her to have been peeved that Luke didn't share that Lorelai was running the party. I don't even think that being wary of your child's father's SO becoming a big part of your child's life is ridiculous. I do think it's ridiculous to go yell at your child's father for something that the other parents probably wouldn't have cared too much about (remembering they would have probably preferred the woman watching over their daughters all night anyhow) and then change her story when said woman came to apologize and try to reach out. 

I'm also not saying that Anna was acting out maliciously or purposefully doing this, but I think this was subconsciously fueling her wanting Lorelai not in April's sphere, which in turn drove Luke and Lorelai apart for good.

I also kind of like her development. I'm not counting revival, but in the OS I found it interesting that at first she was kind of boring and seemed like Lorelai 2.0 but way more shy, less funny etc. and then as the show progressed she actually started to develop her own personality, found things she likes despite her mother's opposite opinions, could stand up to her. Even when I didn't always approve her decision I still thought that it was actually interesting to watch. And I know that revival destroyed her, but if there was a continuation I would probably still root for her and hope she would work things out, get her sh*t together and get some kind of redemption.

As a fan of both shows, I love that r/GilmoreGirls is able to have actual discussions that are in depth studies of plot, character development, philosophy, and so much more.  There is a beauty that comes from a full study and discussion of the primary characters.  There are thread upon thread that is critical of all 4 Gilmores.  (Lor, Rory, Emily, Trix)

I'm saddened that r/dundermifflen is just a subbreddit of memes and idiocy.  There is so much depth in the first 5 seasons of The Office which includes the fact that Michael Scott is not a good person. 

God forbid Office drones actually think about the literary significance of comedy.  God forbid they actually critique the characters to gain a better understanding of the human situation.  

Instead that sub reddit blindly submits to tropes that actually weakens the real impact of The Office. 

The current threads in the 2 subs proves my point.  r/GilmoreGirls has constant discussion of the myriad of intricacies of the GGs universe.

Meanwhile, drones over at The Office create an echo chamber that has retarded the primary purpose of that show.  The Office was a critique of American business life.  And yet r/dundermifflen continues to create a mythology and romance of the angst and desperation of barely scraping by in the 21st Century.

That incident just seemed so insane to me. I mean how narcissistic do you have to be? Add to it the part where they were trying to talk to the inn's former owner's relative while he was literally carrying her coffin down the street and it seems to me like Lorelai might have mental health issues.

The only similarities I see is rich family and blond hair. And maybe issues with family, but that seems to be a problem of all rich people in this show.

So in Id rather be in Philadelphia, he mentions buying the business for the first time. And he says, Yeah and it's a deal, too. The guy who created this platform is such a true blue computer geek, that he just wants to get started on his next project, so he's willing to sell for only $5 million.

And then Phillip later breaks the news: 

LOGAN: [Answering the cell phone] Hey, Philip, whats up, man?

PHILLIP: I'm afraid I've got some grim news.

LOGAN: What, whats going on?

PHILLIP: I just got off the line with our lawyers. They say they just got a cease-and-desist letter from Prism Active, this tech company in Palo Alto, claming prior art on our media 10 platform. They're reviewing the patent now, but

LOGAN: What do you mean, ""prior art""?

PHILLIP: They're claiming patent infringement.

LOGAN: But thats what we bought. Our patents pending. We bought that technology. Thats the entire value of the company.

PHILLIP: But they are saying its worthless. It was already owned. They were just waiting for someone with deep pockets to buy in before they sued.

So I think this could be foreshadowing that this guy maybe wasnt antsy to get moving on his new project but was wanting to get someone to buy for a lot of money, of course, and quickly. Maybe Im overthinking it, but it would seem if someone was trying to unload a useless patent, theyd be happy with something like $5 million and would want someone to come in and buy quickly, maybe without checking that everything is good to go.

RELATED TO AYITL: i feel like this entire revival is a great example of this idea in motion. especially for rory. shes always described positively: smart, honest, rule abiding, thoughtful, blah blah blah. rory even expressed annoyance of this at the end of season 7 when everyone was telling her she was destined for greatness. yet this whole revival completely shatters these associations we have with rory and proves this theory that very few people or no one can exist solely in a certain frame we have decided for them. this even proves true with lorelai, embarking on a hiking challenge. emily falling to major changes like getting a tv in the living room and wearing jeans. 

when i first watched this 2 years ago i was just as annoyed as everyone else with this radical shift and especially rory basically becoming dead. lol at the usernames ive seen saying she might as well be dead. however i might be completely okay with my idea and everyone elses preconceived idea about her being dead. one because its realistic and two because its just so much deeper and challenging than i thought.

I think I finally figured it out. AYITL was never marketed as being a revival in the strict sense of a revival. It was supposed to be a literal year in the life of the characters of the OS. The writers/producers never promised a clean, packaged revival that would tie up story lines and provide a nice parting. In that sense, it wasn't logical for the fans to assume that that's what it would be. There's no way every single issue would have been resolved in a year for these characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what made it disappointing was how little the characters seemed to have progressed within the 10 years that seemingly passed. They weren't in a great place to begin with, which set up the revival on the wrong footing. The revival seemed to take the problems that they introduced in the revival, and tried to show the characters working through those problems. It wasn't a general, ""and everyone lived happily ever after"" type thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel like it SHOULD have been, especially because there doesn't seem to be any plans to make a new Gilmore Girls anytime soon. They owed it to the fans to wrap up the series in a nice way. I feel like ASP was trying to make it ""realistic"" in that the characters dealt with serious, ""realistic"" issues within relationships and marriages and families, jobs and out in the real world, etc. But that's not the kind of thing that (most of? some of?) the fans wanted. We wanted the characters we grew so attached to to have good lives, and while not every single plot thread or issue had to have been resolved, we wanted them to have grown as people and to have gotten in a place in life where we could calmly let them go for a while. But that wasn't delivered. I feel like we can't criticize the show for not delivering, but the show can't criticize us for being disappointed in what was showed to us. ",8,1,False,self,,,,,

(I mean maybe they were showing him as Lorelei saw him, a stand in for Luke, a man who in her past was supposed to be perfect for her but fits no where in her future.) 

But the one thing that really sends me. Is the fact that they got married without Rory ????!?!?
I mean honestly looking back at it they never thought to include Rory in any conversation about the two of them. But the marriage without Rory was solidifying the sentiment that they werent ever going to be a family it was Lorelei and Chris and Lorelei and Rory. The whole thing irks me to my very core to be honest. ",41,1,False,self,,,,,

So watching The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel I understood something about GG. In season 1 Midges father, after her husband abandons her, says: Whats the most important things I ever told you? () Dont marry a weak man. () You have to marry a man who will take a bullet for you. So I get why Luke is the right guy for Lorelai according to the Palladinos, even if hes grumpy, territorial, doesnt buy gifts for Valentines, doesnt like carnivals or people and has nothing in common with Lorelai apart from SH. I will personally never choose a man like Luke, even if I know he has a good heart and I like him as a character. 

Lukes speech in the Revival, in the kitchen, its basically saying that he is the guy who will take a bullet for Lorelai. And thats also why IMO, even if 90% of the audience dont see it that way, Amy and Dan still think Dean was the perfect first boyfriend. You taught me what safe feels like. I dont know if the Palladinos are right or wrong, I personally dont see love that way, I dont need strong but predictable guys taking bullets for me, but it helps me understand their characters. In their shows, there are the strong men who you can always count on and the charming, fun soul mates (Joel, Christopher, Logan?) who you shouldnt choose in the long term even if you love them.

My mom and I are super close and it was always really special seeing another close mother/daughter relationship on TV. 

As I grew older and started having a life, my mom would always say I dont want you to keep secrets from me/not tell me things like Rory does with Lorelai, and I never knew what she meant. Lorelai and Rory were best friends and shared everything with each other, wtf mom? 

Im re(re-re-re-re-re)watching the series again now as a 25 year old, and Im finally understanding what my mom was talking about. I feel like the Girls didnt have as good of a relationship as I always thought they did; it actually seems more normal, and its really bumming me out. I feel like Rory is Lorelais best friend, but its a little one sided. And this isnt to say that Lorelai doesnt have flaws, but theyre not really the subject of this post. 

So... Rory omits information from Lorelai, like, a lot. Any time Lorelai keeps something from Rory, she seems to really believe she has her best interest at heart, is not telling her about Max when they first started dating, not telling her again when they get back together, lying about throwing away her Dean Box... crap like that.  Also, shes the mom so I think its a little more acceptable for her to keep secrets. But Rory keeps huge things from Lorelai, like the first time she likes a boy, the first time she kisses a boy... and okay yeah, thats normal for a 16 year old to do, but theyre supposed to have this special bond, unlike a typical mom/kid relationship. When Rory pulls shit like that, their relationship doesnt seem too special after all.

Additionally, I see Rory as a huge hypocrite bc she always throws a giant fit when she finds out lorelai is hiding something from her, but she does the same sort of thing just as much, if not more, whereas Lorelai always seems so heartbroken any time she finds out Rory is keeping something from her, because shes under the impression that their bond is so special. 

I cant think of any other examples right now, mostly bc Im watching S1E7 right now so these early instances are more prevalent in my mind and its late and Im tired, but if anyone would like to piggyback on this with more coherent thoughts than the shitshow Ive just displayed, feel free.

1) She steals a yacht after not being told she's not good enough. I get it Mitchum crushed her dreams by saying she wasn't cut out for the job but he was right to an extent.  She didn't take advantage of the opportunity and just ""does what she's told"" in her own words.  

2) She expects her academics (and the Gilmore name) will take her wherever she needs to go.  She has never been one to try hard beyond the books and when confronted with the judicial system she relies heavily on the family name to provide some sort of immunity from the law.

3) She's too focused on Logan.  Even to the point where her mom has to walk on egg shells when discussing him.  For all the opinions Rory has shelled out over the years on her mom's life, Logan is a HUGE red flag for a parent and to alienate her best friend because she doesn't like her opinion is pretty cruel.

ENTJs are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. But unlike their Feeling (F) counterpart, ENTJs are characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end theyve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world  but we have ENTJs to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.

Happiness Lies in the Joy of Achievement

If theres anything ENTJs love, its a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the ENTJ personality type brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as ENTJs push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.

At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, ENTJs are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isnt because they are coldhearted or vicious per se  its more that ENTJ personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side cant keep up, thats no reason for ENTJs to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory.

If theres anyone ENTJs respect, its someone who is able to stand up to them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. ENTJ personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep ENTJs from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where ENTJs really start to run into trouble.

Cultivating the Science of Human Relationships
Emotional expression isnt the strong suit of any Analyst type, but because of their Extraverted (E) nature, ENTJs distance from their emotions is especially public, and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, ENTJs will simply crush the sensitivities of those they view as inefficient, incompetent or lazy. To people with the ENTJ personality type, emotional displays are displays of weakness, and its easy to make enemies with this approach  ENTJs will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals, but for their validation and feedback as well, something ENTJs are, curiously, very sensitive to.

ENTJs are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life  and often enough they are. They need to remember though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions, but from the actions of the team that props them up, and that its important to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of their support network. Even if they have to adopt a ""fake it til you make it"" mentality, if ENTJs are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle.

**ENTJ Strengths**

Efficient  ENTJs see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the ENTJ personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.
Energetic  Rather than finding this process taxing ENTJs are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.

Self-Confident  ENTJs couldnt do this if they were plagued by self-doubt  they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.

Strong-Willed  Nor do they give up when the going gets tough  ENTJ personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.

Strategic Thinkers  ENTJs exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.

Charismatic and Inspiring  These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps ENTJs to accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.

**ENTJ weaknesses**

Stubborn and Dominant  Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and ENTJs are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.

Intolerant  ""Its my way or the highway""  People with the ENTJ personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. ENTJs wont hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them.

Impatient  Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking ENTJs. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.

Arrogant  ENTJ personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who dont match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside overbearing ENTJs.

Poor Handling of Emotions  All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes ENTJs distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others. People with this personality type often trample others feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.

Cold and Ruthless  Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes ENTJs incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant.

**ENTJ Friends**

As in most aspects of their lives, in friendship ENTJs seek personal growth and inspiration, and they often have a plan for how to accomplish it. Friendships of circumstance, built on things like shared routines, are not ENTJs preferred method  rather, they pursue their friends, seek out individuals who share their passion for deep, meaningful discussions, and who enjoy learning and development as much as they do. It is not always easy to be ENTJs friends  they demand a lot from these relationships  but they pay a great deal of attention to their friendships, and it is unlikely that it will ever feel stagnant.

ENTJ friendships are built on ideas, and a lot of what they find enjoyable is the repartee of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every angle. People with the ENTJ personality type are very smart and highly critical, and they wont back down if they are put on the defensive  in fact, theres no better way to earn their respect.

Only the most hardened rationalists are able to hold their ground against strongly expressed ENTJ personalities, who neither need emotional support, nor understand others need for it. This lack of sensitivity is ENTJs chiefest weakness. Their tendency to challenge their friends, question their conclusions, and dismiss emotional arguments as irrelevant is especially difficult for Feeling-oriented friends to cope with. Either a point is supported by logic and reason, or it is erroneous.

**Prisoners of Our Own Minds**

More enlightened ENTJs recognize that if ever there was an area where they could learn from others and improve themselves, it is in the realm of emotional sensitivity  to dismiss any aspect of personal growth borders on hypocrisy. Friendships with people from the Diplomat type group can be especially rewarding for ENTJs, as the shared Intuitive (N) trait fosters an instantaneous connection that can bridge the chasm between their uninhibited logic and the recognition that cooperation and conciliation can often accomplish more than that logic ever could alone.

Still, the bulk of ENTJs friends will likely fall into the Analyst category, as all of these types share the same passion for logical, far-reaching ideas and critical debate. Anyone who can match ENTJs ability to brainstorm and theorize will find an honest and dedicated friend. Anyone who cant, as with many Observant (S) types who often question the point of such discussions, will find themselves ignored  perhaps a situation that is best for everyone.

**ENTJ Subordinates**

Subordinate positions are challenging for ENTJs, and it takes active management to ensure their satisfaction and engagement. Ever the high achievers, ENTJ subordinates set out to learn new skills and to seek out new challenges and responsibilities, eager to prove that nothing is impossible with a little hard work. If things get a little slow, ENTJ personalities may slip into periods of absentmindedness, but when they feel involved in the projects around them, they prove well organized and well prioritized.

ENTJs hold themselves to very high standards, but a lot of what sets this tone is feedback from their environment  namely, criticism from their managers. Objective, rational statements about what is done right and what can be done better are helpful to ENTJs, and far from resenting such criticisms, they appreciate them. Opportunities for growth keep people with the ENTJ personality type engaged and productive, and so long as their managers recognize this as their primary responsibility, it will be a fruitful and satisfying relationship.

**ENTJ Colleagues**


Among colleagues, ENTJs are sociable and greatly enjoy sharing ideas and critiques in their frequent brainstorming sessions. Natural leaders that they are, ENTJs tend to assert themselves into positions as representatives and project leads, considering their objectivity and charisma the perfect qualities for these roles. ENTJ personalities enjoy working with equals, but people must demonstrate that they are equals  anyone ENTJs view as being less competent or driven will see only condescension and arrogance.

ENTJs are strong-willed, even dominant, and though they enjoy inspiring and tutoring others, the energy they bring to the process can seem overbearing. When these roles are reversed, ENTJs mentors should bear in mind that their students are very rational and respect firm confidence  hand-holding, emotional appeals or wavering indecision will likely burn the bridge then and there. In a partnership, what is best is what is most effective, and time wasted sugarcoating reality is just that  time wasted.

**ENTJ Managers**

ENTJ managers are confident, charismatic communicators, and they communicate but one vision: to get the job done as efficiently as possible, and to the highest standard of quality. All else is subordinate to that objective, but the means by which ENTJs achieve it cause others to adopt this cause as their own. ENTJs are natural leaders, and their ability to formulate a strategy and to identify the strengths of each member of their teams, incorporating those abilities into their plans so that each individual fills a unique and important role, makes them able motivators.

But while these efforts boost morale and satisfaction among ENTJs likeminded subordinates, they are still crafted to achieve that ultimate goal of timely and exceptional work. Those seen as inefficient by their ENTJ managers, or who demonstrate themselves to be lazy or to produce shoddy work will know in no uncertain terms of their failure to impress. The only way to recover is to comply, the only alternative is to find a new manager to impress, somewhere else.",6,1,False,self,,,,,

She refers to him as an angry kid when explaining to Rory and Luke why he acts the way he does. She even says he doesnt mean the things he says, and that he probably didnt talk about what was going on with school because it was hard to talk about. She defended him to his mom. She went in to tell Luke not to let him sleep in 35 degree weather (which we know he wasnt going to do anyway and she knew too, so it was doubly interesting). 

Then shell confront him and...well, we all know how that ends.

If this were a show on a higher rated network I feel like angry kid, which is the exact phrase she repeats, would be a euphemism for someone with emotional and abandonment issues as serious as Jess, which we are clearly supposed to infer. It makes sense to me that someone like Lorelai would be attuned to those things and while she does hate that hes a little punk who didnt treat her daughter well, the dynamic there is a lot more than that.

Firstly, if the animal was really close and this was the only way to save it, Jess did the best he could.

She is a hardcore Christian and the first two commandments are about about not having any other gods and not worshiping false idols. The fact she did both of those rather than being honest with her mother turns her into such a hypocrite. It ruins the character. 

I'm sure the writers just thought it would be funny to give Mrs. Kim problems with her mother like those Lane has with her, but it ruins the character. Besides, the Kim family has had something like 40 something relatives married at their home in Christian ceremonies so it's beyond belief the grandmother wouldn't know. Plus Buddhists aren't really evangelical, they don't really show interest in convincing people to go to temple.  

A better plot, that didn't turn Mrs. Kim into a hypocritical character who betrays her God, would be for her Mom to be easy going, fun, a big drinker etc. She could disapprove of and clash with Mrs. Kim without the writers betraying 6 seasons of character behavior.

I really hate season 6 and 7 and stuff like this is a huge reason. The writers stopped creating plots around what the characters would do and started writing plots about what they could force the characters to do just to make drama. It's so tedious. I think they just ran out of ideas having to fill 22 episodes so decided to just ignore what would be in character for what would create drama.

However, I really hope that Rory becoming pregnant will make her a better person. Having a baby forces her to confront that her actions and attitude have consequences in a way she didn't have to before. She'll have to really think about her affair with Logan, her career path (or lack thereof) and her life in general. I think that her pregnancy is a turning point and changes her from the spoiled, bratty Rory we ended with into the more mature Rory that we were all hoping for.

At the end of the original series, Luke and Lorelai were going to get married, have their twins, and live happily ever after. Rory had a clean slate and she was going to go off and do big things with her life. But the show didn't think that would be a good idea for a new show, so they picked up where they left off like 10 years hadn't taken place between one show and the next. They pressed pause on character progress and it ruined relationships. Rory didn't progress in her career, making her seem lazy and obsolete. She didn't get over Logan or grow after her affair with Dean, making her a crappy person. Logan didn't get out from under his dad, making him seem weak. Luke and Lorelai didn't have a happy Lily/Marshall (How I Met Your Mother) relationship, which is what I think should have happened. 

Because they wanted to maintain the original show's relationships, they ruined the idea that the characters had made personal progress.

Finally: Rory getting pregnant was STUPID. Stupid stupid stupid. Shouldn't have happened. The whole point is that the Gilmores improve with every generation. Lorelai was more independent than Emily. Rory was more responsible than Lorelai. I know that there were exceptions, all these different occurrences, but the point was that Rory was supposed to improve upon her parents' mistakes. A pregnancy was a bad choice.

Which also bothers me. Surely she'd be a bit more sensitive having had earfuls of Emily's history with Lorelai during their time at the inn?

Then, in the same sentence as congratulating Lorelai and Sookie for 'thinking' of opening an inn, she rushes them into it because I guess she's tired of letting someone else run her property for her and wants a cashout instead. Then lays the guilt on thick by saying she gets so many 'lucrative' offers but couldn't have dreamt of taking them because she 'couldn't do that' to the girls. Wow, what a gift!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ranking the love interests by these factors: How good they are as a person (AAP), how good they are as a character (AAC), how good they are for Rory (FR), and how much I personally like them (FM). I'll also mention the scenes that were big for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

With some Love interests, I split them into eras because their characters change drastically. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Honorable mentions that will not be ranked:**

**Robert**\- Make Logan Jealous at the Party Guy

**Tucker**\- Hot TA Guy

**William**\- Laundry Room Guy

**Graham**\- Emily Approved Bar Crawl Guy

**Sean**\- DC Guy

&amp;#x200B;

**Ranked love interests, in order of appearance:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Dean**

**(First relationship): S1E3-S1E16, S1E21-S3E7**

AAP: Dean is sweet, patient, and understanding. He's very dedicated to Rory- he builds her a *car!* Issue is, he's very protective to the point of irritation (at least for Rory). When Jess or Tristan cause issues, he's not able to raise his issues to Rory in a way that provokes a good conversation. Thing is, he's just a kid. There aren't many times that he does something that isn't completely understandable or reasonable. Points off for that no more mister nice guy stuff after they break up. **4/5**

AAC: As a character, he's a little bit dull. He does the good-boyfriend thing, Lorelai even says that he's a good first boyfriend. He does what he has to and he does the things that a teenager does when his girlfriend is into someone else. He was simply left on the back burner and not developed as a person beyond being Rory's boyfriend. **2.5/5**

FR: He and Rory just aren't good together in general. While they're very sweet to each other (in the beginning at least) they aren't right for each other. He doesn't enjoy what she does and vice versa. Just liking each other isn't enough to build a good relationship. **3/5**

FM: I liked him in general. He should have been left there, after the break up in **S3E7**. That way he could be a non-romantic character. They could have been good friends. But instead they drew it out and made it uncomfortable. Up until this point, I'd give him a **4/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY: 13.5/20**

&amp;#x200B;

**(Affair): S4E22-S5E1, S5E3-S5E8**

AAP: As a person, he sucks. Plain and simple. There is NO PROOF that he would have told Lindsay about Rory (or even broken up with her without telling her) if Lindsay hadn't found the note. I fully believe he was going to just let the affair go on and hurt both girls (not that Rory didn't also have responsibility). As a person, he just sucked in general and was very selfish and jealous once he finally ended things with Lindsay. He was so insecure and irritable, he should have just stayed single and worked on himself. **1/5**

AAC: He didn't do anything good as a character. He wasn't interesting, he wasn't progressing. he was just creating drama to create drama. They should have let him be happy with Lindsay, it would have been a much more interesting thing to do. **1/5**

FR: While Rory was obviously in the wrong, he was incredibly detrimental to her life during this time. Didn't make any sense for them to be together. **1/5**

FM: No. Just no. **1/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY: 5/20 (only because I can't give 0/20)**

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT SCENES:**

First kiss- LOVE it. They were so cute and the way that Rory ran out (shoplifting!) was a really good scene. Fun to watch. 

""Because I love you, you idiot!""- very cute. 

""so damn obvious""- One of my favorite episodes, **S3E7**, is the breakup. The way that Dean breaks up with her publicly and Jess is there? I understand his rage completely. For Rory, I wish he'd done it differently. For the show? AWESOME. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Tristan**:

AAP: He's a little bit of a brat. By the end of his run, you could see him getting better as a person. Issue is, he doesn't have the time to do that. **2/5**

AAC: He was interesting and he had a lot of potential. If it wasn't for One Tree Hill, we'd have gotten that fleshed out nicely. Can't rate much for potential though. **2/5**

FR: Again. Potential! But, as it was, he wasn't good for her. He had too much of his own issues to work out and him making fun of Rory wasn't exactly relationship worthy. **2/5**

FM: I liked him. This category, my opinion, is the only place I'll give potential points. He COULD have been really good.  **3/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY: 9/20**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Jess**: 

(**Pre-Relationship) S2E5-S3E7**

AAP: He's a little shit. Gotta be honest, he's being a real ass to Dean and Lorelai has a good reason to be weary of him. He does have his reasons (ex: his mother sent him there). 2/5

AAC: He's fantastic. Drama, but the right type of drama. He is understandably an antagonistic guy, but then he has the whole bad boy with a heart of gold type thing. It's really sweet. 5/5

FR: He's got a whole lot of stuff in common with Rory. They like the same things, they enjoy each other's company before the romance is first and foremost. She's obviously drawn to him far more than she was to Dean and that at least tells you something about the mental attraction. 3/5

FM: Love him in this time period. Reminds me of the whole mouse pulling a thorn out of the lion's paw thing, Rory being the mouse. 5/5

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY: 15/20**

&amp;#x200B;

(**Relationship/Breakup) S3E8-S3E20, S3E22, S4E21, S4E22**

AAP:  He's just as jealous as Dean is, but with the whole conversation they had after the dance, it's understandable. I don't take points off. He actually tries very hard to avoid getting into any type of altercation with Dean, which is really hard. Dean tried *really* hard. So that, combined with the fact that he was hated by the whole town, I can understand why he left. Doesn't excuse the not talking thing, though perhaps his emotional well being does. 4/5

AAC:  The drama in their relationship was well used, but it wasn't fantastic the way that he left. There must have been a better way to do it. Generally during their relationship he was a good guy and the character was incredibly interesting whether or not you liked him. 5/5

FR: He wasn't all that good for her at this point. Jess tried really hard but he didn't have his life together enough with school and work and his family to be with Rory in a way that she deserved and a way that he himself deserved. He needed to take time to himself to get his crap together. Beyond that self-care he needed, they still had a lot in common. He really obviously cares about her. 3/5

FM: The leaving and then not contacting her between **S3E22** and **S4E13** was crappy. Beyond that, I still love him. 4/5

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY: 16/20**

&amp;#x200B;

**(Post-Relationship) Post S4E22**

AAP: He got better. He worked on what he needed to work on. He still had the feelings for Rory that he'd always had. He spent a lot of time improving himself and it really paid off because he had a book, a job, and a really nice little life. He had the life that he was meant to have considering how smart and generally kind he was. 5/5

AAC: He was a shot of nostalgia in the later seasons. It was really nice to see him treating himself nicely. I genuinely enjoyed his presence because every moment he was on screen was something I enjoyed. 5/5

FR: He had a lot of problems before. Now he's all better and he's not chasing Rory the way that he was before (though he does brush Logan the wrong way). He's just a more realized version of his former self.  Plus, he got her back into Yale. Go Jess! 5/5

FM: He always needs a hug and I am ready to give it. 5/5

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY: 20/20**

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT SCENES:**

The picnic basket (**S2E13**)- Obviously pissing Dean off but doing it oh-so-sweetly. Obviously he made a big deal in front of the whole town. Total dick move, paid off nicely. 

The Paris/Jess/Rory dinner (**S2E16**)-  He melded with Paris and Rory. It was nice to see that they have things in common besides the romance. 

""See you for some tree planting"" (**S2E17**)- Rory somehow got him to listen to Luke. No one else could do that and she did. 

*EPISODE:* Car accident (**S2E19**)- Everything about them together being friendly, him being yelled at by Lorelai, and him crying on that bridge at night just... wow. 

Graduation day (**S2E21**)-  It really sucks that he had to leave, but we got an episode that showed how much she truly liked him. She was willing to do what she had to to see him and it bonded them even better.

First kiss (**S2E22**)- It was so goooooood.

The dance marathon (**S3E7**)- The way he antagonized Rory and Dean was very dickish. No questions. But it made for good TV.

""I think I loved you"" (**S3E22**)- Rory is obviously upset he left and the fact that he hangs up shows that he doesn't have the emotional capacity to deal with it.

""I get to leave first!"" (**S4E13)**\- It was a very funny scene in the beginning and it ended with a sharp scream (as it does every time I watch)

Rory packing up (**S4E21)**\- Another sharp scream.

Jess's book, confrontation with Logan (**S6E8)-** He gets her back into college. He does what Logan couldn't.

Jess's Open House (**S6E18)-** You really get to see how good he's doing and that he's still into Rory. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Marty**:

**S4E3-S7E10**

AAP: He's a pretty good guy. Has his issues though. He can't be friends with Rory once she rejects him because it's too much for him. While that's understandable, he also doesn't really do much to convince her he'd be a good choice. **4/5**

AAC: He's a good character, especially so that it shows that every boy who's into a girl that has similar interests doesn't necessarily get the girl. They were just friends and as a friend, he could have become a Paris. **3/4**

FR: He was a really good friend, but she had absolutely no interest in him that way. If she had interest in him he might be a 4/5, but seeing as she doesn't: **2/5**

FM: I liked him just fine. Not too interesting, not too upsetting. No scenes with him made me squeal like the other boys. **3/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY: 12/20**

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT SCENES:** 

Marty almost asks her out (**S5E9)**\- 

""He's not coming after you, he likes you"" **(S5E10)-**  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Logan**:

**S5E3-S7E21**

AAP:  He's a good guy. A little douchey when he wants to be or when he doesn't really acknowledge the people around him. Sometimes he needs some help seeing that. Otherwise he is a very kind and thoughtful person who needs to do a little growing up. Needs to learn to say no to his dad. **4/5**

AAC: He's fantastic. He brings intrigue and makes life more interesting. It's nice to see a sense of benign entitlement in him as opposed to rich kids making peoples' lives miserable. He walks into the cafeteria with Rory because he pays the school and he has it like that. He doesn't hurt anyone or make their lives harder, though he does piss people off sometimes (Marty). **5/5**

FR: He's really good for Rory. He makes her loosen up, he tried to get her back in school, he does all sorts of things for her that go beyond just using the money that he didn't have to work for. The only thing that would take a point off is that he wasn't willing to not be married, he issued an ultimatum. Other than that, top marks. **4/5**

FM:  He was really one of my favorite characters. He made a lot of things better about the show and he was a boyfriend that didn't get totally tight-assed about Rory being into another guy. It was really nice to see that she was allowed to have  a crush while they dated. **5/5**

&amp;#x200B;

**TOTAL TALLY:** 

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT SCENES:** 

The jump (**S5E7**)- One of the best scenes. It shows how he's able to really make her step out of her shell and participate in life rather than just watching everything. He's a reason she gets to be more outgoing.

You'll be okay (**S5E8)**\- When Dean just leaves and Rory is stood in front of her friends embarrassed, he makes her feel better. He just continues without making it weird and that's such a great reaction. 

""If I say I can, then I can"" (**S5E18)-** He is changing his whole method of living to be with her at this point. He doesn't do things like this, yet there he is. He begs her to date him. Logan Huntzberger. 

The Huntzberger family dinner (**S5E19**)- He goes all in all the way for her and yells at his dad. This is one of the moments when he really makes an effort to not be his father. 

You should have told me (**S5E22**)- Again he wants to fight his dad, but he pauses that to make it so that Rory doesn't suffer consequences, something that he didn't have to do and was less than likely to do. 

""Rory, I love you"" (**S6E11)-** He said it! I loved this scene because he was in totally new territory and the way he said I love you showed that.

""I have no idea where to get Ginsu knives"" (**S6E14**)- Again, an example of Logan being true. When he said that he was all in, he meant it. 

""I have, on occasion, found other girls attractive"" (**S7E14**)- A very big difference from her other boyfriends. Logan and Rory didn't have the jealousy thing (except maybe when Jess visited). He let her be a normal girl with crushes and accepted that they were human, but would not be cheating on each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In that thread, it was mentioned that Mia's act of taking in Lorelai prevented Emily from finishing raising her daughter and also having an active role in Rory's life.   

This is what one of the commenters said.   

&amp;#x200B;

**Bingo! And the way she talked to Emily as if she had taken her in as a baby - she robbed Emily, who had raised Lorelai, of being a part of her granddaughter's upbringing, not to mention keeping a minor from her parents.**

**Of course, that's from Emily's point of view, as we never saw much of teen Lorelai bar that dreadful flashback episode.**

I don't want to comment on that opinion, but it did make me think about the logic and legality of Lorelai running away and any liability to the person who took her in.  

I've always wondered why the Gilmores didn't try to, or perhaps didn't succeed, in bringing Lorelai back home.  It's very strange to me with how they are and their resources that not much is said about that day, or week even in the flashback episode.  

Now, it is acknowledged that Emily fell into deep depression after Lorelai's departure, and perhaps she and Richard had given in to the idea that their daughter didn't want to be in their world anymore, and let things be.   It's important to note that compared to the Gilmore house, Lorelai and baby Rory were leaving in dire conditions.    

I don't know... Lorelai being a minor, wasn't it the legal thing to do to have her return home for her to finish high school at least, and also have support in raising Rory.  I know this goes against the whole premise of the show and Lorelai's personality, but what is the connection to real life in this case?

Has she not learned professionalism or just how to network yourself properly in the real world? I mean it's kind of no wonder that Mitcham is underwhelmed by her, I would be judging someone who behaves that way too. 

Then there's the fact that she annoys Logan for information when he clearly doesn't have any. I don't see how it would be necessary for her to need information about him, she could just make small talk or ask some simple questions about the paper and that would be more than enough to impress him...
