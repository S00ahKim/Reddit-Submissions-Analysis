My first thought was that it was Jared since obviously hes probably the busiest out of the three given that hes the co star of a show he plays a main character on who is in nearly every scene which would mean hed have to work around an already insane filming schedule (and doesnt Supernatural film in Canada?) and that his team might demand a higher pay, but then it occurred to me.in what capacity would he even have to be in the revival? Im not saying theyd just give him a tiny cameo since Amy said at ATX that shed find a way to fit all of the boys in the revival in a way that would make sense, but I honestly cant imagine a situation where Dean would have a storyline big enough that would require Jared to be there for longer thana few days maybe? Certainly not long enough that it would really be a big deal for Amy and Dan to tweak his storyline a bit if he wasnt able to be available at a certain time.

The next obvious guess would be Matt, since hes also currently on a show where he has a prominent role, and I can think of a bunch of situations for Logan to have an actual storyline in the revival that would have to be altered if he wasnt available, but the actor who played Finn confirmed that hes coming back which means that they must be pretty sure, if it hasnt been confirmed for them already, that Matt is going to be available since theres really no reason for Finn to be around if Logan isnt going to be there in some capacity.

Which leavesMilo. It makes sense that Jess would be in a certain storyline that would need tweaking if he was unavailable, but I honestly cant imagine Milo not being able to do it since all hes really doing right now is filming a pilot I think? Though I cant help this gut feeling I have that it might be him, for no other reason than the fact that its completley possible that he might have other unannounced projects that hes working onand the fact that im having serious deja vu to when the show was on air and Amy would always talk about how the door was always open for Milo to come back and that shed write him back in if he made time for her but booking him was a nightmare since he was always so busy. 

Whoever it ends up being, I still think its a bummer that theres a possibility that Amys still not really able to tell a certain characters story the way she wants to.

I'm a big Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars fan, so I know how exciting it is when your sadly departed show comes back for a revival.  The Veronica Mars movie was a LOT of fun. I saw it the day it came out in a theater full of people who had a lot of energy. The movie, if you're unaware, is partially set at Veronica's 10-year reunion, so basically every minor character from seasons 1-2 makes an appearance. Even Deputy Leo and Piz show up in the movie despite not going to Neptune!  It's great. The audience was having a blast. 

BUT I will say that the full-cast reunion does not hold up as well the second time you watch. I realized later that what I missed the most about the show was the writing and feel. The movie had some of this, but it also felt like a lot of fan service and inserting inside jokes and callbacks. There's a reason why a lot of people preferred Rob Thomas's book to the movie since it did a great job of capturing the show's unique writing without the burden of revisiting old characters and plots.

Anyway, what I hope for the GG revival is for well written stories that are treated as though the main characters are back as though they had never left. And while it would be a bummer if everyone (Sookie) isn't there, it's not essential. And I don't want to waste time catching up with every character during the show's long tenure.

I just feel like the characters don't even act...remotely human! The conflicts make ZERO sense! I read somewhere that the writers wrote in April to give Luke and Lorelai conflict...but I feel like you have to have realistic conflict to work. While I get that finding out you have a kid can make things screwy with a relationship, April's entrance offers no normal, messy problems: baby momma doesn't want any financial assistance, she isn't trying to get in between Luke and Lorelai. The kid is old enough to be cool with spending casual time with her father, and she isn't in a bad situation where she has to move in with him. So what is the problem? The problem is, Luke wants to be a big part of his daughter's life, but he won't allow Lorelai to be a part of that. Why? Because Lorelai is FUN, and April WILL LIKE HER BETTER. WHO the hell comes up with that?? Not even by twisted creep-o standards, it's just so out there! From my POV, this makes Luke to be controlling and downright abusive...to shove Lorelai out of a big part of his life, to me, reads that he doesn't truly love her. If he did, he would want to include her in his family. He'd want April to love her, too. Not normal, by any human standards. 

Another example of stupid zero-sense conflict: April's mom getting mad that Lorelai was at the birthday party. No mother would let her teenage daughter and all her teenage friends sleep OVERNIGHT at a man's house ALONE without fully trusting that man and his JUDGEMENT.

Happy to update this if I'm missing anything! I'm sure I'm missing some - who knew the cast was so big? And I will keep updating as we get more news.** 

**Confirmed:**

**Kind of Confirmed:**  
 
* John Cabrera/Brian (Tweeted ""I can confirm that today was a pretty awesome day. #GilmoreGirls""-on the day Netflix officially announced the revival. Sounds good to me.)       

**Up in the Air:**  
 
* Jackson Douglas/Jackson (interestingly tweeted ""TBD"" in response to a twitter question asking if he'll be in the revival. I'm assuming no Sookie = no Jackson, but he tweeted this on Jan 26th, BEFORE the Melissa McCarthy tweet scandal...)  
* Sebastian Bach/Gil (this guys seems awesome. He re-tweeted Lauren Graham's revival confirmation tweet with the message ""You rock!!!"" and when asked on twitter if he'll be joining the revival, he replied ""that would be so great"")  
* Alan Loayza/Colin (no clue, but he's retweeted GG stuff in the past and Finn is in, so why not?)  

**Probably won't be returning:** 
 
* Melissa McCarthy/Sookie (we all know what's going on here - secretly holding out hope that Mike Ausiello facilitates an emergency mediation between MM and ASP, and that Melissa announces her return to Stars Hollow at SNL when she hosts next week. A girl can dream right?)  
* Kathleen Wilhoite/Liz Danes (tweeted at Melissa McCarthy - ""I wasn't asked back either"")   
* Michael DeLuise/TJ (no clue but why would there be a TJ without a Liz?)

But after watching it again this weekend, I'm starting to feel that Logan &gt;&gt; the other two. (Before the angry starts...) Hear me out:

**Dean**: He's cute, he's tall, he loves Rory, and he made a wonderful first boyfriend. He took her to the Chilton dance and made it special for her when she had no friends. He made her a car so she wouldn't have to take the bus to school. Season 1-2 Dean was wonderful... and then he came back in Season 4 with a different personality. It's like he regressed, and passion is not a reason to be stupid. If he had divorced his wife, then gotten together with Rory, his actions would have been acceptable (not great, but acceptable). If he lost the temper tantrums, that would have been acceptable (again, not great, but acceptable). Ultimately, he was a better match as a childhood sweetheart than a long-term boyfriend.

**Jess**: This was tough. When I was young, I thought his understanding of Rory far exceeded that of Dean and Logan. Now I'm not so sure. To his credit, he likes Rory for the right reasons; he loves her intellectual side and it didn't hurt that he's good-looking and very exciting. But Jess has baggage like I've never seen before, and while passion and chemistry are good things, they're not sufficient for a real happily-ever-after. Also, like Dean, he seems to have boundary issues (Dean is suffocating, while Jess has no problem trying to move in on someone else's girlfriend... twice.) While older Jess is more mature, I can't see him as a family man, or getting along with Lorelai or Luke. And if he can't even get along with Lorelai and Luke, I highly doubt he would get along with Emily and Richard. Rory is not one person; she has a family who loves her and she needs a man that can get along with them. So overall, better than Dean and a great source of comfort for Rory, but sustainable long-term.

**Logan**: As a kid, I did not like him. He took everything as a joke, had a mob of women around him at all times, and he didn't like Rory enough to commit in the beginning. But now that I've rewatched the series, I thought his and Rory's relationship was the most realistic. Think about it in real life terms: though two people may initially find each other attractive, they need time to understand the other person before they commit. But once Logan decided he will commit, he did his best for Rory. Yes, he slept around when he thought they were broken up, but keep in mind that Dean lied about leaving his wife to sleep with Rory, and Jess up and disappeared with no notice, and crashed the car Dean made for her (seriously, when a 16-year old boy poured that much effort and love into make his girlfriend a car, you show half an ounce of respect for it at minimum.) Logan gets along well with Rory's family, he doesn't try to suffocate her, and unlike Chris, he actually showed up when Richard was at the hospital, despite his previous argument with Rory about whether she should have hid her acquaintance with Marty from Lucy. (And he was right; it was a thing of poor taste Rory and Marty did to Lucy.) Overall, I wouldn't say Logan is the perfect match for Rory; he's just an improvement off the other two.

Like you, I am over the moon about the Netflix revival. I can't believe it's happening!!!! It has been an exciting few weeks as we learn more details, bits and pieces of news are released, etc.

I'm wondering how everyone feels about avoiding revival spoilers in post titles? I think I've decided to stay as spoiler free as possible, but some posts recently have casting spoilers, story spoilers, etc. right in the title.

What could we do to avoid this, and should we? If the sub is feeling like it's not an issue that's cool, too. I'll just have to unsubscribe for a while &lt;sob&gt;.

I was trying to wait until we had a set date for the release to have everyone sign up - BUT I'M JUST TOO EXCITED TO WAIT ANY LONGER WITH ALL THE CAST ANNOUNCEMENTS. (i've actually started stockpiling items for whoever I get matched with)

So, my original plan was to use elfster because I've had a lot of success with it, but I've changed my mind. A recent swap I participated in used it, and someone hacked in and got all of our addresses. Horrible news. So, a mod here suggested we use google forms. I'm setting that up right now.

I'm thinking the questions will be something like:

*Name:
*Age (in case your swap partner wanted to send alcohol, we need to know you're 21):
*Location, and would you be willing to ship internationally:
*Favorite Character(s):
*Favorite Snacks:
*Any allergies:
*Favorite episode:

Does anyone think we should add any other questions? 

I figured we can just let people sign up for maybe 2-3 months and then send out the pairings. I'm asking you to be willing to spend at least $20, but you're totally allowed to spend more if you want.

Alright everyone, here it is! Let me know if you have any issues! :)
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14LK6SyuhzecHQFB4pyUsOy08UuJvDEjYHiRwlt13E5s/viewform

Once everyone has entered their information and we have a date for the release, I will be emailing each pair so that they can reply all, delete me and communicate with each other, exchange addresses and what not. These boxes are going to be expected to arrive BEFORE the show premieres, so you have it for the episodes are added to netflix. We can do rematches, but they won't be paired until after the episode airs and people will have to volunteer on a needed basis.

**EDIT** We have over 50 participants so far! Most are from the US &amp; Canada and we are looking for more from the UK to sign up :)

**EDIT 2** I'm loving all of your responses and I can already tell we're going to see a lot of great gift boxes being sent out. Thanks to everyone who has signed up so far!!

**EDIT 3** I noticed a few people are putting ""over 21"" as their age. That's fine if you're uncomfortable disclosing. But, the reason for asking age was to try and make sure a 41 yr old is not paired up with a 16 yr old. Just wanted to throw that out there. Also, we all agreed alcohol was not to be sent out in this exchange, so no worries about that either.

With that said, we have some fans who feel pretty strongly about avoiding spoilers. In light of that, we've decided to implement some new rules which we will be **strictly enforcing.** If you see a post or comment that breaks these rules, **please report it.**

1. Reboot spoilers are not allowed to appear in post titles. Any post that shows a spoiler in the post title **will be removed.** Repeat offenders will be banned from posting.

2. All posts that will discuss spoilers regarding the reboot **must** have a [SPOILER] tag at the beginning of the post. If your post contains reboot spoilers and is not tagged, it **will be removed.** Repeat offenders will be banned from posting.

3. Unless relevant to a post already tagged as containing spoilers, all comments that contain reboot spoilers must use spoiler tags. Any comments containing spoilers that are not properly tagged **will be removed.** Repeat offenders will be banned from posting.

Additionally, We now have post flair! Please flair your posts. The categories are as follows: Reboot Spoiler, Reboot News, Reboot Discussion, OS (Original Series) Discussion, OS News, Episode Discussion, and General Discussion. We may add new flair options if it seems we need more categories. I'm also looking into filtering options, but I'm a noob at CSS so we'll see how that goes!

Basically, just be mindful that many, many fans would like to experience the reboot as organically as possible. They want to be surprised as the stories unfold. Be respectful of that. Spoilery news will still be allowed here, but it **must** be properly tagged and the spoiler can not be written in the post title. If a post is tagged as containing spoilers, users may *enter at their own risk.*

We are being more forgiving on spoilers of seasons 1-7 since the show is so old, but it doesn't hurt to tag those posts either. As an example: ""What Luke says to Lorelai...(season 6 finale spoilers!)"" just to look out for any newer fans we have.

One more thing while I have your attention: SPAM -- there is a lot of spam being posted recently, this is a site wide issue and many subs are affected. If you see something you think is spam please report it so we can remove them more efficiently!

Please respond with any feedback you have regarding these rules or any questions you'd like clarified. We definitely don't want people unsubscribing because they feel this is an unsafe place!

Here is a reminder on how to do spoiler tags: [Your spoiler] (# s) without the spaces would become...

I am posting for the first time because the series is so old that I wasn't sure I could avoid spoilers. I'm glad I avoided them - what a ride! I've had a really enjoyable year going through all of these.

I'm not quite sure how I never came across Gilmore Girls before, but I only discovered it after watching some of Supernatural and seeing someone mention that Jared was in parts of this. Then I watched Parenthood and was sad when that was over, and immediately went looking for other things Lauren Graham had been in. And this has so many of my favourite things. The parent/teenage kid dynamic, single parenting, teen pregnancy, guitar music, too much coffee, hilarious dialogue, cute guys, and OMG - that early 2000s nostalgia. And it has that warm and comforting feeling. I don't know at which point in the last year it surpassed Fringe as my favourite TV show of all time, but it has done it.

Sorry to gush with basically nothing interesting to share, but I love this show so so so much! I simultaneously wish that I'd discovered it back in 2000 when I was 12 and would have idolised Rory and am glad that I discovered it in 2015 when I can idolise Lorelai, revel in the nostalgia and just generally have the experience of seeing it for the first time now. And the remake!! There is going to be a remake! I cannot handle this. It's like the greatest gift of all time.",9,18,False,self,,,,,

While Lorelai was gone, a grumpy, lonely Luke joins the FBI and gets assigned to the ""Jigsaw case."" After a close encounter with death at a meat-packing factory, Luke changes his mind about living life on the edge. He decides to return to Stars Hollow, reopen his diner, only to find Lorelai waiting on the porch. They get married and move into her house.

Meanwhile, Jess, while enjoying his life as an artist in Pittsburg, suddenly has extraordinary dreams about flying. He returns to New York City to find a cure, only to find that he has extraordinary powers. Despite his best efforts, he is unable to control the power and ends up almost blowing up the entire city. Tired and drained, he ends up in a coma, where he sees himself blowing up and TJ, dressed in a beard and old English costume, laughing. When he wakes up, Jess decides to return to Stars Hollow, hoping his uncle/ big brother figure will have a solution. He finds that Luke is married to Lorelai, and stays for at least nine months.

And yet, on the other side of town, someone is having a worse day than him. When Dean came back from breaking off his relationship with Rory, he finds that Lindsey has gotten herself involved with an unsavory crowd that involves at least one shady, pale looking guy who might have at one point been a vampire, because ""people kept telling her to get a job so she did."" Dean worked out, bought a gun called ""The Colt,"" read up on supernatural beings, and left to go hunting. Halfway there, he hits his head on something and suddenly remembers that his real name isn't Dean; it was just the first name he said after his Chicago-Stars Hollow family found him on the street passed out in a salt circle. 

Far away from the East Coast, Logan Huntzberger is working in Chicago as an attorney. It turns out that after Rory reject his proposal, he had no inclination to go to California by himself, so he went to law school, moved to Chicago, where he now works as an attorney alongside the wife of the former Cook County State's attorney. Only, as he approached the courthouse one day, he finds himself working the opposite side of a case against... Emily Gilmore?

* Emily
* Lorelai
* Rory

It ends when Emily dies.

It ~~reboots~~ begins again with Rory, aged 31/32, pregnant with a girl. She and her family moving back to Stars Hallow. 

Lorelai starts to give the best grandparent - slightly similar to Emily (DSL, sewing school stuff, etc). 

We see the circle of life with everyone. Sookie's kids fascinated with veggies, Lane's liking music and Kirk's quirky kids.

-----
**Why?**

* Because we love Stars Hallow and we are emotionally invested in everyone else ... rather the charmed life either rejected or accepted by the main characters.

* The first episode Rory was 16, which is chronologically correct. Which means Rory is either 31/32 (depending on the air date) as she was born October 8, 1984.  

* I didn't watch Northern Exposure for Joel and Maggie.  I didn't watch Will &amp; Grace because Will and Grace. We rarely watch television programs of central characters, it is the universe around them we find interest.

* Most people try to re-create their own environment they grew up with, if they had a good childhood. Something familiar they want to pass down.

* Gilmore Girls was about Emily, Lorelai and Rory.  ",15,3,False,self,,,,,

Feel free to provide your own!

1. The show will start and end in Stars Hollow, given the appearance of Lane's kids in 1 and 4. Maybe Lorelai and Luke are finally going to finish those renovations.
2. Paul is Rory's new (temporary :P don't get mad, teams everyone else.) boyfriend/date at the start of the show. His age and profession suggests he knows Rory. His ""strong"" supporting role suggests he has a bigger part than many. He doesn't seem to appear again.
3. Paris and Doyle are married with children. There's a call for a Portuguese nanny (Paris had one, Doyle met her) and two Caucasian kids under the age of 8.
4. Spring will be about career and life success (Paris, Doyle, etc) Maybe Jim is Rory's new boss?
5. Rory will sleep with Jess (because she already did with Dean and Logan)
6. There are a lot of disheveled people in Summer; any guesses? Maybe it has something to do with the hippies in Fall?
7. Rory is doing a scoop on commune living?

My mom drove me over to her house because my friend and her mom were going to take me out to breakfast and to go see the movie ""UP!"" for my birthday. When I walked into her place her mom was cooking food and they were both dressed as Luke (flannel and backwards baseball cap). Dividing her kitchen from her living room she had those french zig-zag things you get changed behind things (sorry, no idea what they are called) and it was decorated like the front of Luke's Diner. It had the sign and a painted door and everything. Her mom was being ""rude"" and acting like Luke and my friend said ""We decided to have breakfast at my house if that's okay!"" and handed me Luke attire to wear. After I put it on she said ""Our living room is a mess right now! You don't want to see it! Actually, just look, its crazy!"" And opened the ""door"" to Luke's. She had her whole living room set up like the diner! She had mix matched tabled and chairs, a long table on one end serving as a counter, with a glass case on it (Like Luke always had muffins and doughnuts and such in) and inside was a lemon pie (my favorite). There was a ""no cellphones"" sign behind the counter, and my favorite episode of Gilmore Girls playing on the T.V. in the corner of the room. But the best part was all my friends were sitting at the tables in the makeshift diner all dressed as Luke! It was truly an amazing birthday party. We all ate breakfast and watched GG :)
I later found out that the invitations she sent out had the Mussolini quote ""We have buried the putrid corpse of liberty!"" printed on the front of them like Lorelai wanted to put on her and Max's invitations  

anyways just wanted to share that because it is something I will never forget!
