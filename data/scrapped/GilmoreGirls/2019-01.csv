I love when Luke and Lorelai are in the kitchen together teasing each other, because it shows how they have a lot of together in their day to day lives, and are super comfortable together.

When it comes to Harvard, she doesn't even know that extracurriculars are important! That's basic knowledge for just about any student, and Rory is supposed to be Ms Planned It All Out. When it comes to her application essay, if it hadn't been for that forum, she would've written another typical two bit Hillary Clinton affair. When it comes to her article, she didn't even know piracy was something everybody was writing about, and again she would've just written a run of the mill piracy sucks article. She's supposed to really want to be an international journalist, and Paris has to drag her into that International Relations(?) club! It's also Paris who makes her vice president of the student body, something undoubtedly important for her application. In fact if it hadn't been for Paris I doubt she would've gotten into Yale...

The passivity extends to her personal life. The number of times Lorelai got into trouble because Rory didn't speak up or want to upset her grandparents... the time Lorelai had to finish errands before the first day of Yale because Rory wrote the date down wrong springs to mind. Emily was so upset because she thought Lorelai had just given up on Friday night dinners, and held Rory hostage and ruined the evening they planned, and all Rory had to do was explain to her grandmother that her mom had to finish up the errands for school because of her mistake, or say politely at some point ""hey grandma, I've got school tomorrow and I've got to get ready, we'll finish this up next time,""  and leave. But no!

I understand she began the show at sixteen, but she shows no signs of changing throughout. Tbh I think the only thing 'special' about her at all was her ability to work hard, and people like that are great, but Rory grows up to think she's so brilliant that one piece of criticism breaks her completely. One of the few times we do see her writing it's that horrible article about the ballerina... and I do think it's horrible. Personal attacks like *the roll of fat under her bra* are immature and unprofessional, and comparing her to a hippo wasn't funny in the least. Honesty is important, and so is genuine criticism, but I didn't see the slightest bit of originality or humour in what was quoted from her article, just petty comments.

I'm not surprised she's struggling in the revival. That lack of initiative, coupled with how entitled she was getting towards the end of the season and how spoiled and coddled she is by everyone... people say Rory's arc isn't what they wanted in the revival, but I think that's exactly where she was heading throughout the series.",66,1,False,self,,,,,

Did ASP have some inner hatred for the Rory character or something? I understand it isnt fun for a television character to stay the same way throughout the whole series but did Rory really need that 180? I loved Rory up until the Dean incident in Season 4. Also, I never liked Dean (Luke was right all along). I hated how she knew she was wrong but still thought it would be okay to be with him againRory is SO much better than that and even Alexis Bledel thought it was out of character.

Then she meets Logan, who I liked when he was first introduced. I thought he was sweet, charming, and good for Rory but now I see him as smug, entitled, and manipulative. I think the first two speak for themselves but for the ladder, he convinced Rory he did nothing wrong by sleeping with Honors friends while they were taking time apart. She knew she wasnt okay with it, even after she said she was, AND Logan knew it too. Again, Rory is better than that. 

Ill be starting Season 7 soon and I hope I dont hate it because of the Palladinos departure (after all, I enjoyed the post-Sorkin seasons of The West Wing). I already have sympathy for this season because of the mess that was left in Season 6 concerning Rory, April, and Luke/Lorelai, which seems like something is about to happen to them based on their behavior and that a season finale is coming up.

Sorry for the rather harsh rant. I really love the series so far, especially Seasons 1-5. I just have some issues with the way the Rory character was developed. I read that she only gets worse from here, including in the Revival, which is extremely disappointing. This character had so much potential.

When he says she is a force of nature just like Lorelai, I question it. 

Most of Rorys life and goals were pretty much set by Lorelai such as wanting to be a journalist and etc so that she could experience the life Lorelai never had. This led to problems in her career and the way she responded to criticism. 

She never showed any signs of leadership/took initiative in Chilton and most of Yale. The only exception to this is during the Yale daily news where she helps get the paper printed during Pariss reign. Even when Paris did the operation finish line and forced Rory along, she never considered any of the post-grad options such as med or law school even though it may have been a booster. 

Furthermore, I dont believe Rory had true journalistic talent. I agree w/Mitchums assessment that she didnt have it. (Although the way he phrased it was negative). That isnt to say that she isnt a good writer-having good organizational skills and such, but she never formulated in depth opinions /analysis of situations on her own nor did she have the drive to accomplish non-scholastic achievements. 
Ive read some of the threads in this subreddit and the threads which relate to this dont really mention her work during Doyles term. I was under the impression that she had decent writing skills but she didnt know how to formulate her own opinion on her assignments. She mostly told a chronological summary of what happened instead. For example there was one episode in which she was upset that her piece didnt make it into the Yale Daily News and Doyle told her it was a snooze.  However, on the other assignment in which she had to comment on a ballet piece she brought Lorelai w/her and Lorelai made the remarks about the fat around the ballerinas strap. I dont think that she would have been as opinionated in her assessment of it if she had gone by herself. 

I see a similar problem in the revival wherein she has poor networking skills. She doesnt fight for her meeting with GQ and relies on Logans dad to set it up since nothing worked.  Also, she doesnt connect w/people in her assignment on lines. She falls asleep interviewing a source while Lorelai effortlessly makes moves to help Rory out by offering the snack to the lady who works at the shoe store (an item Rory is supposed to be reporting about.) 

I feel like a few reasons that Rory turned out this way is because it was like her life was almost pre-determined for her. So, the only time she really had to explore was in college. This is the root of the problem of neither Lorelai nor Emily and Richard assessing Rorys flaws and constantly praising her instead. During the show Rory is frequently viewed as a replacement Lorelai (it is how her character was written) therefore it was difficult for anyone close to her to acknowledge her flaws since it is always hard to come to terms w/something against your beliefs/expectations. 

These are just several of my thoughts after a recent rewatch:)

I love these Palladino-isms, and get a kick when I hear one in Maisel because it feels like an inside joke, a joke that only us true ASP fans, us die-hard Gillies, will be in on. 

I liked listening to the Gilmore Guys podcast because Kevin seemed just as nerdy as all of us about the show, and his encyclopedia-like knowledge of lines and scenes from GG rivaled my own, so I was impressed. But he really let me down during this review of Maisel 201.

One joke device I noticed during the episode that they didnt discuss on the podcast was when Midge is in the drag club in Paris and is talking on stage a mile a minute as a translator is repeating her jokes in French, also a mile a minute, and it gets going so fast that you cant hear one for the other. ASP used this exact device in Gilmore, in episode 119 Emily in Wonderland, when Lorelai is welcoming a group of Japanese guests as a translator stands next to her and talks just as fast and loud as her, just in Japanese. 

And on the subject of the French drag club... during the Maisel Goys podcast, Kevin posits that this scene was Amys reaction to drag queens being a common part of pop culture nowadays, and that Midges over-the-top Whoa! Youre men?! But youre so pretty! reaction is representative of how Amy herself would react in that situation. He acted like it was the first time Amy had addressed the subject of men in drag, when of course it actually isnt. In episode 203 of GG, Red Light on the Wedding Night, Lorelais bachelorette party is held at a drag club and the only person who seems appalled is, oddly, Michel. All that to say, ASP was putting drag queens in her shows back in 2001. Shes not that out of touch. 

Later on in the season, the songs Swonderful (from *Funny Face*) and The Coffee Song (which I will always hear in Miss Pattys voice no matter what) are referenced, which any GG fan would recognize. 

Has anyone else been noticing these little ASP-isms used in both shows, or is it just me?

For those who dont remember, the premise of the game 1, 2, 3 is that as guys appear in the girls field of vision (theyre staring out the window at Lukes), they can either choose him or pass. But if you pass Guy #1 and Guy #2, youre left with Guy #3. 

Well, for Loreleis turn, she passed on two guys before Luke came up to the table (inadvertently becoming Guy #3 in the game). In the show, Lorelei has (arguably) two great loves before she ends up with our boy Luke  Christopher and Max. Lor passed up two men before she settled down with Guy #3. 

And then Rory. As soon as they look out the window for Guy #1, theres Dean. Rorys first love. The love shell eventually pass up (along with her Guy #2, Jess) before [REVIVAL SPOILERS] being stuck with Guy #3, Logan.

Dean: Gets treated as the bad guy when his girlfriend is emotionally and physically cheated with another guy by being portrayed as clingy and possessive as a justification for Rory doing this. He subsequently cheats on his wife with Rory later on.

Jess: The writing is kinder to him than it is for Dean but he is portrayed as hostile towards women such as Rory, Lane and Lorelai. That scene with him almost forcing himself on Rory in Kyle's bedroom never sat right with me.

Logan: Sleeps around with several women when Rory wants to take a break from the relationship. Cheats on his fiance with Rory.

Luke: Portrayed as an asshole in his relationship with Lorelai while the writing goes out of its way to make her look Lorelai a victim.

Chris: He was never much of a father towards Rory. Constantly in and out of her life. Also slept with Lorelai while he was engaged to Sherri.

While watching the show with my wife, I noticed certain symmetrical tendencies Ive charted Harry Potter before, so I figured Id give Gilmore Girls a go. 

The results are interesting. Ill post the chart and follow it up with a discussion:

A. Rory leaves for Chilton (rejects Dean)

B. Lorelei calls Chris, wedding falls through

C. Luke takes in Jess

D. Rory &amp; Lorelei Euro Trip

E. Rory begins Yale; spurns Jess, later sleeps         with Dean

D. Rory &amp; Emily Euro Trip

C. Luke takes in April

B. Lorelei sleeps w/ Chris, wedding falls through

A. Rory leaves for new job (rejects Logan)

This chart isnt perfect, but its workable. This means Gilmore Girls is a ring composition. The beginning, middle, and end link together. The show begins, turns, and ends with major career/relationship events in Rorys life. 

First she begins Chilton &amp; chooses not to return Deans I love you in the old car. This mirrors her spurning Logans marriage proposal at the end, and Jess lets move away proposal at the end of S4. 

Next we have two mirroring failed engagements of Loreleis that each involve Christopher.

Luke takes in Jess which is mirrored by his taking in April.

The turning point is bookmarked to two trips to Europe.



Is this significant? Absolutely. It shows incredible foresight by the writers to bring the show full circle. It also (dont kill me) justifies April being on the show. Ring composition demands parallel sections.

The meaning is stuffed into the middle, which is why most people LOVE the S4 finale. Its the shows central axis on which everything hinges. 



There are 7 seasons, a classic number of completeness. Ever wonder why there are 7 Harry Potter books? Vladimir Nabokov used this structure for Lolita and Pale Fire (and probably more). Its gives the author some measure of power over the meaning of the work and it shows artistry and complexity. Credit John Granger for mapping out both Harry Potter and Lolita (which you can find on hogwartsprofessor.com).

Having recently watched the series, I think that Rory might be the Christopher in all of her relationships. 

ASP constantly hammers the message home to the viewers that Rory is supposed to be Lorelai's 'mini me'. But I don't see this at all. Rory is such a different person from Lorelai. Lorelai is very much like Emily in that she has a strong, dominating personality and a fierce will to do things her own way, uncaring about what others say or think. Rory is so different from that. She's quiet and shy timid; her decisions sometimes gave me the impression of her being wishy washy. She's a people pleaser and struggles to stand up to criticism (whether or not that criticism was deserved is a different discussion). She bends to the pressure of her mother and her grandparents, struggles with saying no to either. This is vastly different from Lorelai, who is very strong willed. But it is similar to Christopher.

The Christopher that we see in GG is very weak willed. He doesn't fight for custody of Rory, doesn't seem interested in her when he does show up, can't hold down a steady job, can't commit to Rory or Lorelai in all those years from her moving out to when we meet him in season 1. He pines for Lorelai but is unable to break away from Sherry. In the teenager episode, he talks with Lorelai about breaking away from wealth and their parents world, but doesn't commit to it in the end while Lorelai does. He's very uncertain of his life every time we see him. He reminds me a lot of Rory in his passivity.

Which makes me wonder about how Rory's baby is going to come off. For all of ASP's claims that Logan is Christopher, I really don't see him as the type to stay away from his child for years on end. He's got a strong personality, like Lorelai does. I think he'd fight to be in his child's life more than Christopher and wouldn't let Rory pull an Anna and run away.

It's okay, but I'm not sure it lives up to the raves I've heard about it here and elsewhere.

Susie is just Gypsy, with ASP's potty mouth added. She needs to be toned down a bit. The constant jokes about her looking like a guy got old fast.

Midge's two children have zero personality, and the way the family keeps making fun of the baby's big head and subpar looks reminds me of Lorelai and Rory making fun of the pictire of the ugly baby. It's  tasteless. ASP clearly has no idea how to write for young children.

Which brings me to Midge being glad her roommate is fat so she can't steal her boyfriend. Meanwhile, of course Midge is like Lorelai, eating tons of mac and cheese, drinking tons of alcohol  and staying skinny.

Too much time spent each episode on stand-up comedy, like the time wasted on the musical in the Revival. I understand seeing full scenes of Midge's acts, but too much time spent on other comics.

Of course a trip to Paris. 

It's an okay series, but I don't think it lives up to the hype. Can anyone who loves this series explain why?

The episode was recorded shortly after Scott Patterson had mentioned a possible continuation but before any official announcements were made. Scheer pretty much immediately naysaid the idea before Kevin mentioned that ASP had the finale in mind during the whole production of the OS. 

Scheer responds by saying (very loosely paraphrased) that its all well and good to have an endgame in mind but that an ending for a seven season show wont really work ten years later because all of the characters need to have changed and grown during the time away. With hindsight, one of the major complaints with AYITL is that the characters seem to have been completely stagnant in the ten years away (Rorys career seems like its just starting out, Luke and Lorelai are just finally talking about marriage and kids all those years later, etc.).

I blamed ASP laziness to write something new than what she originally planned and her stubbornness to end the show with the full circle/ Rorys unexpected pregnancy and Lorelais wedding. What bothered me is how she got there not the end itself. But then I started thinking.. maybe this was a business way of ending the show..  
For example if Rory lost her long term job and had no boyfriend but only affair with Logan who wasnt engaged, and still gotten pregnant at the end, it would not leave us with too much questions. If Lorelai had open an new in, tried/gave up on an idea with having more kids and finally got married, it wouldnt also leave us wondering.. 
But now, there is a lot of things that could be explain in another revival. I am starting to believe that ASP purposefully did that. Not that she knows or wants to do it in 10,15 ish years, but if she is jobless and other actors are free in that time, she could. If you guys know what I mean! She kind of left if open in a sense that would be possible to go back to it if wanted/needed. 
As mentioned, it does probably depend on a free time of the entire cast and if fans want it or not. What I do feel is little tricky here is- do the fans want it? The reason number one for this revival to happen is that we kept asking and asking for it, and Netflix realized it will be watched. But because lot of people are disappointed with it, I am little scared that there wont be any future pressure to bring it back.

Anna wasted twelve years of her daughters life to prove some asinine point to herself. (Im sorry but I dont buy that she didnt tell someone about his baby because he complained about children at a movie theater.) April literally had to dig through her mothers love letters with various random men, which seems pretty uncomfortable, to find her three potential fathers.

Also, it wasnt as if Anna was protecting April from an unreliable or hostile father. Luke was a perfectly reliable, kind, and trustworthy man, who stepped up to the role as soon as he realized it was his. If Anna had told him she was pregnant and he reacted as she apparently expected him to, she would actually have a reason for keeping April from him.

Im surprised April didnt feel incredibly angry and hurt, if not in the original series when she was a teenager, then in the revival. It didnt seem like Anna planned to introduce Luke and April to each other, and she let them be unknown to one another for twelve years.

I dont mean to come off as so angry in this post, my apologies. I just find this to be one of the most unfair storylines in the show, and I suddenly wondered why April had never recognized how unfair her mothers actions were on her. We all talk about how hurtful it was to Luke and it definitely was, but it would also probably be terribly hard on April.

I'm in the earlier seasons this time, and Max is a regular.

Don't hate me for saying this, but I really love Max best of all of her boyfriends. Luke is wonderful, but I think they should stay be best friends for forever (not lovers/partners). He's kind, he's often funny, and he can be handsome when he takes off the lumberjack with a baseball cap look. But - he's such a curmudgeon. And he's utterly inflexible. And he's a horrible communicator. I love him, but I can't imagine being in love with him. This proves itself true in the final four episodes: he loves her deeply, but their relationship is so broken and sad. Their inability to have a conversation about children until it's too late is just so tragic and broken.

I really love Max, however. His character is such a good fit for Lorelei (or maybe for me lol!). He's incredibly bright and quick, and he's much more adaptable, and romantic, and handsome, and I think he has big dreams for himself the way Lorelei does. He's more emotionally intelligent than Luke, and he doesn't need Lorelei to mother him into being a reasonable person. I wish they hadn't written the scenes for Lorelei to back off from him, creating incompatibility where there was none. I think that Max is Lorelei's equal in a different way, more compatible than Luke. Why couldn't Lorelei have loved him instead?

In Rorys Dance, I love how Emily insists on staying when she sees Lorelai cant move, even if it annoys Lorelai initially. Its also nice to see them joke around and Emily offer to warm up the burrito when Lorelai doesnt want the banana on toast. The most touching scene is when Emily tucks her in and Lorelai says, Thank you, mommy. I know that her thanking Richard for letting her sneak out is a popular scene on here, but I find Lorelai calling Emily mommy and Emilys subsequent reaction quite adorable.

Other scenes like Lorelai defending Emily after Jason interferes with her plans and Emily comforting Lorelai after she admits that she probably wont marry Luke are also nice. 

However, my favorite scene (next to the one I just mentioned in Rorys dance) is the one in the revival when Lorelai calls Emily to share one of her favorite memories with a Richard. Thats probably one of the only scenes in the show I truly got emotional with. Emily was so engrossed in the story; she seemed angry when Lorelai mentioned that some kid in her class said she wasnt a real Gilmore, she smiled at all the touching moments, and just looked generally happy. Lorelai crying also made the scene so emotional, and Emily saying thank you at the end was sweet.

I'm thinking about season 2 in the drag club when Rory is wearing her hair wavy. Or in the Basket-bidding episode when Lorelai has medium-length bouncy curls. Also in season 4 when Lorelai's hair is wet from the salon and it's at its curly state. 

I like that they are both actually curly girls like me. ",15,1,False,self,,,,,
