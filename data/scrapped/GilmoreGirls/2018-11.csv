Yes, the two situations are different, but Rory had a whole range of negative emotions regarding Paris being with Asher while she was with Jamie, and that is a storyline that lasts 3 episodes. To me, Rory's reaction to Paris and Asher is the correct response for her character, and therefore, I feel that the affair with Dean was incredibly bad writing, as it didn't suit the morals of the character that was only established around 10 episodes earlier.",29,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

All the OS teens are parents/ guardians, their parents are grandparents, and the babies born in the OS are on the verge of becoming teenagers.  And Emily is a powerful, opinionated great-grandmatriarch with no fucks left to give, reminiscent of Trix.

&amp;#x200B;

Rory becoming a mother would be a fascinating new challenge for her relationship with Lorelai.  Whenever Rory did something Lorelai didn't expect or approve of, Lorelai wrestled over how to handle it.  Now, she'll have to advise and support Rory without overstepping her bounds when Rory does things differently than she would have.  There's a lot of good material there.

&amp;#x200B;

And Rory and Lane both have some interesting parts of Lorelai's arc.  Rory is a single mom trying to juggle parenthood, relationships, and a career.  Lane is a young, cool rocker mom whose kids are on the verge of becoming teenagers.  Both of them have baggage from their teen years that they wouldn't want to pass on to their kids, albeit in very different ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Dean, and Jess both have family in Stars Hollow, so getting them into the story would be easy.  Paris and Logan can come to visit Rory/ the kid.  And if Liz and TJ needed Jess to watch Doula for a while, it could have a full circle ""Jess becomes Luke to a difficult teenager"" vibe. (And Luke could ask if he wants any fries with that karma).

Luke did come to the table, though, so in a way, that does make him Lorelais number three. If you consider Lorelais relationships, she went Max, Jason and then Luke. This isnt counting Christopher because he was a relationship before the show and when she was still a teen. Im also not counting Alex because he was more of a brief romance/dating experience than an actual relationship that simply fizzled out instead of being broken off.

I so wish we could have had a scene where Jess was finally able to confront Liz over her terrible parenting and how it impacted his life.  She brought man after man around and who knows whether those men abused him or not, drank and did drugs, offered him no stability, and then just abandoned him.  We got to see him lash out at Luke but we never really got see him confront the parent who damaged him the most.

Luke did his best but in the end he abandoned him too which it makes it even more incredible that Jess grew up to be the responsible, mature, and successful young man that he became.   I do think Luke had some positive impact on him but sending him away twice didn't do Jess any favors and didn't help Jess to trust people.  In the end of season 3, he leaves Rory because he would rather be the one leaving than the one being left. He can't handle any more pain, any more people abandoning him so leaves before Rory can dump him which he thinks she will probably do after he couldn't get her prom tickets and was failing school.

LORELAI: Nothing. I just, well, I'm putting the bunny back with his little friends and I just sort of massacred them a little bit, but that's life in the jungle isn't it?

When Lorelai gives few details at first, they react the same -- both are quick to blame Lorelai, assuming that she was the one to call it off. But once Lorelai explains that it was Christopher who left, and that Sherry is pregnant, it always strikes me how their different reactions really sums up the different tensions in Lorelai's relationship with each of her parents.

Richard still blames Lorelai -- he ties it back to her decision not to marry Christopher, which in his mind is her original sin -- the one mistake she's made that he cannot bring himself to get over. The actual pregnancy itself, while of course shocking and a source of contention, isn't what really ruined his relationship with Lorelai -- nor was her leaving. It was her choosing not to marry Christopher. In this s3e1 scene, he says something along the lines of ""Of course Christopher will marry Sherry, Christopher always tries to do the right thing."" This is the resentment he harbors towards Lorelai still. He sees her unwillingness to marry as stubborn and obstinate, and specifically meant to embarrass him and Emily. If \*only\* Lorelai had just sucked it up and married Christopher, he thinks, and everything would have been /fine/.

Emily, on the other hand, I think views the pregnancy and Lorelai's choice to run away from home as an insurmountable tragedy that derailed the shining future of her beautiful and talented daughter. Even though Emily is harsh to Lorelai, controlling, and oppressive in her childhood, I think there is a big part of her that internally dotes on her. She gets angry at Lorelai because she sees the potential for Lorelai to be a worldly, high society, brilliant, educated, and beautiful young woman. In her mind, the raw beauty, intelligence, and talent is there -- it's just that Lorelai doesn't ""use"" those raw gifts the way that Emily thinks she should. So here, Emily sees once again that the potential for Lorelai to have the kind of future that Emily deems suitable has been derailed -- and she blames Christopher. Not Lorelai. She sees Lorelai as having finally made the choice to ""reunite Rory's family,"" and Christopher as the derailing force of Lorelai's dreams (aka, Emily's dreams for Lorelai).

I think that at the end of the day, Richard is almost more concerned with appearances than Emily. I think that Emily believes that if Lorelai makes the choices that Emily thinks she should, she will be happy -- because she can't fathom that her idea of happiness is different from Lorelai's. Even though they butt heads, I think there is a relationship deep down where Emily's main concern is her daughter's happiness, in her own misguided and controlling way.

Richard, on the other hand, is more concerned with Lorelai's effect on the Gilmore legacy. He is unconcerned with her happiness. In some ways, even though Lorelai and Emily clash way more often, that fundamental lack of concern for his daughter's happiness makes their relationship less salvageable. It's like when he defends her to Straub -- he makes clear that he wasn't doing it for her happiness, but for the Gilmore name. (Whether we, as viewers, buy that explanation, is a different story, but that's what he and Lorelai both believe is the driving force of his defense of Lorelai in that moment). Richard is able to connect with Rory, it seems, because unlike Lorelai, he is actually deeply concerned with her happiness.

Anyway, just some thoughts as I re-watch some old episodes! This family sure has some complex relationships.",20,1,False,self,,,,,

That said, a big criticism a lot of folks have is that Lorelai's call to her mother in Fall to talk about her and Richard at the mall on her 13th birthday -- her best birthday --  seemed weird because if it was such a good birthday, why would she have not remembered? However, I think it makes perfect sense. 

I am currently on my first full rewatch of the OS since the revival came out, and I just finished S2. What's really struck me is how much Lorelai and Emily, each in their own ways, are really trying to better their relationship with each other. Lorelai inviting her parents to Rory's birthday party, taking Emily shopping; Emily wanting a spa weekend with Lorelai to bond; Emily, originally aghast at having to be in the Chilton fashion show, having the time of her life because she's up on stage with her daughter; Lorelai reaching out about her wedding veil; Lorelai showing up just to be with Emily after Richard reveals how bad things are at work and shows how much he's really been taking it out on Emily. There are so many moments when they both show that they do care and, despite how much Lorelai in particular insists their relationship will never improve, how much it does in just these beginning seasons. 

Now, Richard rarely reaches out this way to Lorelai. He dotes on Rory, but it's almost as though, while he still loves and cares for Lorelai being his family and his blood, he's beyond the point of wanting to exert any additional energy on trying to repair their relationship. This despite Lorelai reaching out specifically to him, the big one being when she helps him set up his office when he starts his business. She totally didn't have to do that, but she not only talked him out of packing it all in when Margie couldn't come on board, but volunteers to spend what appears to be several days with her father, assisting him, setting up his office and getting his schedule situated. Yet, he takes her for granted and is almost frustrated when she says she has to go back to work. When he defends Lorelai to Strobe in S1, he makes it clear it wasn't about her being attacked but about the Gilmore name being attacked. 

In other words, Lorelai, despite her pretenses and insistence otherwise, always seemed very desirous that maybe, just maybe things would get better. And in between the fighting and fighting and snarkiness and fighting, she reached out and also accepted outreach to do so. But Richard rarely reached out to her individually (there are a few times Emily and Richard as a couple do, like attending her graduation). 

So when he dies, Lorelai is grieving not only the man she lost, but the years and time lost. This is a relationship that absolutely can never get any better than it was when he died, and we aren't really sure how that was. So she's grieving, angry. When put on the spot to talk about a man who was oftentimes cold to her for the past 40 years, she -- drunk and angry and upset -- blathers on embarrassingly. She doesn't remember The Birthday.

Slightly personal divergence: My parents and I were really close through my high school years and some of college. I mean, they were my best friends. I hung out more with them and their friends than peers my age. But around college, as I was exploring new people and new worlds and expanding my horizons, for reasons I'd rather not delve in to here, we aren't that close anymore. Our relationship is all surface, and ultimately I know there will come a day where even that is gone. I've spent the last five or so years being so frustrated and angry at them that I often forget there were any good times at all. Until I hear something or see something random and I'm like, ""Oh, I remember this really cool thing happened."" It's like memories I've totally forgotten come flooding back every so often, and it's like, ""Oh, we did some cool stuff together."" 

Back to GG: I truly don't think it's unrealistic that, being so angry at her parents for so long (and her 13th birthday, at that point, being 35+ years previously), she had forgotten this day. It wasn't a huge trip or a big, memorable, crazy thing. It was her and dad at the mall and at the movies. Yes, it was unusual and out of the norm for her family, but it's one of those experiences I don't doubt could get lost for a time. It's like looking back through a photo album and being able to tell detailed stories of exactly what was happening in/around the photos, but maybe you would have had no memory of it till you saw the photo. So as Lorelai -- possibly for the first time that we as an audience have known her -- has left behind all responsibility in order to look inward, to focus on her and her needs and wants, is thinking through her life and choices, the paths she's taken and abandoned, what has brought her to that point. And something clicks. And she remembers the birthday. And it's the one time, the biggest time Richard reached out to Lorelai and showed interest in their individual relationship. When he wasn't concerned about the family name. Wasn't concerned about what she was doing wrong. But was concerned about \*her.\* He wanted \*her\* to be happy and to feel better. 

I could never put my finger on why the cries of ""She wouldn't have forgotten!"" seemed wrong to me, but I think this is it. 

TLDR: Lorelai wants a good relationship with her parents, but Richard never really reciprocated that desire after she had Rory. So after years of resentment and anger, a memory of an ordinary-but-extraordinary event gets buried until Lorelai self-reflects and remembers. It's not crazy. It's not unrealistic. It's life, and it's the passage of time, both the good parts of it and the bad.",16,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

I am currently watching Let the Games Begin (S3E8), the episode following the dance marathon. Richard invites Rory (and Lorelei) to tour Yale before his Whiffenpoofs reunion, and naturally a fight between Richard and Lorelei ensues. 

Lorelei is upset because Richard manipulates Rory into having an interview with the dean of admission without preparing either of them for it. She argues that he is trying to control Rory and her future simply because he likes control, and the reason their relationship is bad is because he couldnt control Lorelei so he simply gave up on her. 

Richard counters by saying this has nothing to do with Lorelei, and has everything to do with Rory getting into a great school. 

Although I disagree with the way he went about it, I actually agree with Richard. It may have been said in a not-so-nice way, but Lorelei really doesnt know much about the college system, much less the Ivy League system. Furthermore, her blind desire for Rory to go to Harvard is immature and inconsequential. She should want Rory to have as many options as possible, both for safety as well as choice. And it is very possible that Richards status as an alumnus significantly improved Rorys chances of getting into Yale.

All in all, Lorelei is being weird and immature, and the fight that she and Richard have is difficult to watch. ",10,1,False,self,,,,,

Now in the real world, if a couple had been dating a while and one partner gives the other a key, the conversation would be a lot more like thanks this is really sweet/this means a lot/throw in a little kiss.

99,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2018-11-10,2018,11,10,1,9vlpi4,self.GilmoreGirls,I wonder how Dean looks back on his relationship with Rory. POSSIBLE SPOILERS ALL,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/9vlpi4/i_wonder_how_dean_looks_back_on_his_relationship/,isthiscleverr,1541779841,"So I'm currently rewatching (likely evident by my daily posting lol), and I just finished the Yale visit episode of S3 (of course, which immediately follows the dance marathon/is the beginning of Jess/Rory). And I got to thinking, I wonder how adult Dean looks back on his relationship with Rory. In all honesty, they really only had a few months' worth of happy relationship free from any drama. 

1) They broke up on their three-month anniversary, were apart for months, then got back together at the end of the school year, so late May/June. 

2) So we can assume that the summer vacation, another three months, was relatively without incident. (This outside of normal teenage/relationship drama, so I'm not counting stuff like the fight they had about Rory doing Rebuilding Together or anything. This is only pertaining to issues stemming from extra-relationship controversy/scandal.) 

3) Jess arrives very shortly after the start of school, so we'll just round up and say another month later. So we'll call Take 2 at about 4 months now. Rory and Jess meet at her house. It's brief and, while he seems immediately fascinated by her, she's the normal polite Rory. It's not until a few nights later when they run into each other in town and he gives her her book back that there's a hint that she's into him at all. Then, of course, much of S2 is taken up with Rory's obvious growing interest in Jess and Dean's increasing awareness of this fact. So even if they aren't outwardly fighting about it or discussing it, we can assume that within a few weeks of Jess's arrival, Dean is already likely suspicious/anxious about Jess. 

4) Fast-forward to end of S2 when Rory kisses Jess. Then she goes away for three months. As soon as she gets back, she is crazy jealous that Jess moved on and Dean is more acutely aware of Rory's interest in Jess than ever before, culminating in his breaking up with her at the dance marathon. The dance marathon is two episodes before the Thanksgiving episode, and while we can assume that Dance Marathon and Yale Visit were essentially within a week of each other, we're unsure of how much time passed before Thanksgiving after the Yale visit. Let's be generous and say it's another month later. That means Dean and Rory broke up sometime toward the end of October. 

5) Of course, Rory and Jess immediately get together, and Dean likely knows and/or is witness to this very quickly after he breaks it off. 

6) Fast forward another year and a half or so, and he's hastily married in a relationship he's not passionate about, still holding a flame for Rory. So they cheat, he gets divorced, they awkwardly date for maybe another month or two before he breaks it off again. (This happens in S5E8, likely sometime around October/November in the show -- air date is Nov. 8. So again, assuming they officially began dating again around August/September when she gets back from Europe, it really isn't long at all.) This go-round, of course, is not only awkward, but often tense as they have to deal with other people's perceptions of how/why they're now together. (Not to even mention that, again, after they cheat together, she goes off to Europe without much of a word to him, so that's likely not a very positive time for him.)

So they actually dated three times (for ease of calculation): three months, about a year and a half, and then another month or so. So all told, there's somewhere around two years' worth of dating time in there. Of that time, though, all but about six months of it is likely a bit tainted by insecurities of his girlfriend liking another guy, then immediately dating that guy once he dumps her, then her cheating with him, essentially causing his divorce, then leaving for months without a word, then coming back and dating but having to deal with drama/controversy, AND THEN him breaking it off again because he sees her coming out of her grandparents' house drunk and surrounded by a bunch of guys -- a very literal interpretation of his previous insecurities. 

Not only this, but we can infer that, while Dean had dated before Rory, that Rory was likely his ""first love,"" much like he was hers apart from the fact she had never dated at all. (I infer this since Lane tells Rory in S1 that Dean had a girlfriend in Chicago but that he didn't feel like they were really in love. Also, they're sixteen at this point, likely with somewhat short dating histories to that point. Plus, Dean likely told his friend about the most significant past partner. If there was anyone that had meant more to him or was his first love, it's likely that would have been who he told Todd about. It's possible he didn't, but just going by what we know, that's what I'm assuming.)

So we essentially have a guy with a little dating history finding a girl that he is crazy in love with, dating her, and very quickly realizing she's into another guy, spends the vast majority of his relationship with her trying to ignore the fact that she's interested in someone else before finally breaking up with her, then being so torn up/hung up on her that he ruins his marriage over it to be with her, only to realize that she hasn't changed all that much and they just can't get back what they had in that first three months.

My thought (which is, I think, corroborated by the brief Revival appearance) is that he likely doesn't look all that fondly back on his relationship with Rory. Much of it was tainted, and my thought is while he might appreciate the relationship for what it was and might realize that Rory isn't a bad person, that this isn't the great love story of his life like he thought it was when he was a teenager. Unlike Rory, who meeting him in the Revival, seems to very much romanticize her time with Dean as this great love story (one of a few, for her, but a great story nonetheless). (Granted, it's been a minute since I've watched the Revival, so tell me if I'm wrong there.)

Lorelai handles the whole Rory-dropping-out thing so annoyingly! She does the same thing she accuses her parents of. When Rory wants to live her life differently than Lorelai thinks is best, Lorelai just shuts her out (I agree Rory shouldn't have dropped out, but still). She yelled at Richard for doing that exact thing 3 seasons earlier (S3E8):

**Lorelai:** My whole life, you have tried to control  everything, and if you didnt get to control something then you just didnt deal with it.

**Richard:** Thats ridiculous!

**Lorelai:** When you couldnt control me, you didnt deal with me!

&amp;#x200B;

Then in S6E1 when she bursts into Richard and Emily's bedroom to drop off Rory's stuff:

**Lorelai:** Now you get your do over. A new and improved Lorelai. Congrats. Very well played... My involvement ends here. With the laundry basket... I'm out. You've won. She's  all yours.  

&amp;#x200B;

Why would she not try and talk to Rory? She should understand Rory was embarrassed and scared because for the first time in her life someone told her she wasn't amazing. Rory clearly handles criticism and the possibility of failure very poorly (at Chilton when Max gave her a D on her first paper, when the college admissions panel made fun of girls writing about Hillary Clinton, when she was told to drop a class at Yale, etc). If Lorelai hadn't shut down Rory completely when Rory first told her she wanted to drop out, Rory might have had time to process Mitchum's criticism and found a different way to deal with it.

In it, Lorelai and Sookie have a fight about Sookie missing every meeting at the Dragonfly and not pitching in enough to help Lorelai. 

I can't imagine how difficult it must be as a mum to a newborn (having no children myself), but Lorelai has a point here. It was Sookie's job to approve the new sink for the Dragonfly - a job only she could do, as she would have her own exacting specifications for it. At this point, she knows that the Dragonfly is struggling financially and that Lorelai is haemorrhaging money trying to keep it afloat. She must have known that not being there to approve the sink would add an extra unnecessary financial burden on them, and yet she still didn't show up to approve the sink. 

That's not all - her defence (aside from ""Davey wouldn't sleep last night and then I fell asleep with him"") is that ""this stuff"" (i.e. the decision-making) isn't her part of the deal. Well, tough shit. It's sure as hell not Lorelai's part of the deal, making decisions about the kitchen. Their whole fight is beyond infuriating (probably because I can see both sides of the argument here), and it made me consider other infuriating parts of the series.

* Kyon and Brian: It's cute how he learns so much about Korean culture and how awkward they are with each other, and then they spend Lane's wedding reception making out. I wish we would've seen more of them in season 7 or the revival.
* Paris and Jess: I think we only have that one interaction between them in ""There's the Rub,"" but they have such an interesting dynamic. I'd love to see more Jess and Paris interactions.

Just dropping in to announce the new cookbook - Daily Cravings - is out now and available from your favorite bookseller!

To give you a little info about it...
It's filled with 100+ recipes, each one derived from the show itself - there's none of this ""inspired by"" stuff. No. Each recipe is based on an actual food eaten, shown or mentioned sometime during seasons 1-7.

Okay, so what's in this one, especially considering there's *already* an entire cookbook of GG recipes? First off, it's not all junk. In addition to recipes for Homemade Pop-tarts, pizza, taquitos, cake, pie &amp; ice cream, it also contains:

- some nutrient-rich food (yes, really!), like Caesar's  namesake Salad, Sookie's Broccoli Tarts, Lorelai's fictitious Breaded French Country Chicken, Sookie's Mini Orange Biscuits with Ham &amp; Cheddar, Emily's Caramelized Salmon, and Sookie's Lobster Bisque.

- plus, many of the junk food recipes the girls *do* eat have been transformed into homemade versions using fresh ingredients which means they are less expensive to make, lower calorie and have higher nutritional value, without a lot of the additives. 

Suddenly eating Pizza Rolls, Eggrolls, Tater Tots, Bagel Dogs and Funnel Cakes doesn't come with nearly as much guilt!

This book has more than just Sookie/Luke/Emily recipes. It includes recipes for foods from Weston's Bakery, Al's Pancake World, Taylor's Ice Cream Shop, Mrs. Kim, and town festivals. 

After the last book I found myself wishing it contained more foods I could make as appetizers for watch parties, more cookies I could make to add some Stars Hollow sparkle to my holiday baking, and, mostly, I wished it had recipes for pies.

So...this new book has ALL of that, and more. 

I really hope folks find this new book to be usable, easy to follow. 

You can learn more about it and/or order it on my website - https://www.eatlikeagilmore.com

I'm also happy to answer questions!

Also how enmeshed Lorelai and Rory are?? Its always a running joke and theyre always together etc, but... they really constantly are? Is it any wonder that Rory seems very socially awkward, at least for the first few seasons? Beyond unhealthy. 

Also when Lorelai lets Rory know that shes pulling out the mom card- I feel like Lorelai thinks that Rorys decisions are good decisions because Rory listens to her, when in reality its because its what Rory decides is best for herself, if that makes sense?

Now that I've enjoyed the series in its entirety, I'd like to give my opinion on the divisive character that is Jess Mariano, and why I feel like he gets a bad rep he doesn't really deserve. I'll probably get massively down voted for this since it's become clear to me how pro-Logan this sub is, but let me just say that I really don't mind Logan or Dean (in Season 1). So, this isn't a post about why you should be Team Jess but rather my opinion on the aspects of Jess that some tend to dislike.

1. **Jess was an awful boyfriend to Rory**

I don't mind spoilers which is why I knew that most Gilmore Girls fans agreed Jess was a terrible boyfriend during his and Rory's short relationship. This made me extra cautious of when they got together, but once they were in a relationship, I didn't really see it the way everyone else seemed to. I instead believe that the disappointing side of their relationship is a failure of the writers' parts rather than incompatibility. Throughout Season 3, there are numerous times Jess and Rory are spending time together but it's referenced rather than shown. There were many statements from the main characters saying that they were having dinner together, or ""watching a movie"" etc. So it's evident that Jess and Rory did spend a lot of time together (unlike how many claim Jess never made time for her) but the show's narrative never really allowed viewers to see that unlike Dean and Logan - whom we saw with Rory having cute moments on many occasions. We should've seen Jess and Rory talking about books or anything away from the physical side of their relationship. Jess leaving Stars Hollow and THAT scene demonstrate that Jess really wasn't ready for a relationship, but people do ignore the good aspects. I know some Logan fans might dispute this, but if many Logan fans can blame Revival Logan on the failure of ASP's writing, the same can be said for Jess.

Side note: Jess was also by far the least jealous of Rory's boyfriends (or at least best at dealing with it). Where Logan would you his social class or Dean would explode or shame Rory, Jess would request that Rory have told him

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Jess was rude to Luke and Lorelai**

Jess was 100% disrespectful to many of the elders in Stars Hollow and I'm not going to begin to justify his rudeness to Luke (although you can see him make amends for that by paying him back later). I do think that Jess gets wrongfully attacked for the 2x05 scene with him and Lorelai though, because that scene was just uncomfortable. It's funny that Lorelai, who would defend Rory on numerous occasions even if she's in the wrong (such as against Lindsay's mother), could just as easily antagonise Jess for something he didn't deserve. In the scene, Lorelai catches Jess almost drinking beer and rather than leave it at that, proceeds to lecture him on how good of a situation he has with Luke and more. Considering Jess has been repeatedly abandoned by his family, the fact that Lorelai is shocked he acts like a prick in return is hilarious. I can't imagine how I'd react if this woman who I don't know and knows nothing about me, continued to give her opinions on my life and why I should be grateful (especially if I was as angry at the world as Jess was). 

If someone had done the same to Rory, Lorelai would act in a much worse manner, yet the show's narrative would still want you to side with them.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Jess was the least important of Rory's boyfriends**

This is so wrong I don't even know where to begin. First of all, Jess was more important than to the story line than both Logan and Dean! He was the nephew and key to the character development of the show's main male character. Anyone who actually believes this is just ignoring how special Jess and Luke's relationship was, and how much it positively affected both of the characters. Secondly, in terms of Rory, Jess was the first real love that Rory experienced - her and Dean were absolutely puppy love, while Jess was her first example of genuine passion and infatuation. People really do diminish their relationship, and ignore how impactful Jess was considering how much less we were exposed to him than the other love interests (Dean was present seasons 1-4, Logan 5-7, while Jess was only main seasons 2-3 with sporadic appearances in season 4.) Jess also such a massive effect upon Rory as a person - getting her back to Yale, proposing she writes a book in the revival. Many sub commenters like to argue that Rory was already changing in Season 6 when you can literally see the realisation in Rory as Jess scolds her.

I feel like here is a good place to mention how hilarious of a character Jess is too!! I watched the show with my sister and I swear she only really laughed at Jess' scenes (the uniform, swan, lake, walmart). He really does deserve more credit for his wit, since everyone seems to focus on his teen angst much more.

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Jess tried to force himself on Rory**

This scene is one I really can't defend because consent is a major issue and a very delicate topic. I would like to show my perspective of it, as even though Jess was in the wrong in this scene, I didn't see it as him attempting to rape her as many seem to argue. This is another part of the show that I'd heard of before I watched it, so I really was anticipating that would leave me disgusted with Jess. However, it really left me feeling sad? One thing that stuck out to me was how it felt like Jess wasn't in his own mind in this scene - the news of not graduating and being unable to take Rory to prom clearly left him fucked up and he's acting off through all the episode after. And when they do start kissing heavily and Jess ignores Rory's initial wishes to stop, it really felt to me that Jess was kissing to drown out everything that was happening and was completely out of it. Many say that he was being horny or dangerous, but Jess while being teen angst in a person, never showed a wish to inflict harm upon Rory. I think he was so out of it that he was using Rory as a means of distracting himself from his own sadness and disappointment.

People also give him shit for shouting at Rory after they stop and seemingly blaming her for not having sex, but as soon as she leaves the room he even states that his anger is not her fault. Jess then follows after her but gives up after seeing her with Dean. Therefore, I think people who claim Jess is a rapist etc. are ignoring the context of the scene and his actions during and after it - he's never portrayed to be with Rory simply for sex. Overall, this is a very delicate topic so I don't expect everyone to agree with me, I just wanted to state how I viewed the scene.

&amp;#x200B;

5. **There isn't enough evidence Jess actually changed as a person**

By far the worst argument used against Jess, there is more than enough evidence and this is a last ditch attempt at discrediting the character development of Jess. Through Seasons 2-4, all the characters go on and on about how Jess will amount to nothing and we're led to believe that Jess will just work in Walmart forever, a job that doesn't really fulfil his potential. Then he comes back and:

\- He's written a book!

\- Helps Rory realise she's straying on the wrong path

\- Works at a book press

\- Made friends :')

\- Pays back Luke for everything

\- Inspires Rory to write a book in the Revival

\- On good terms with his Mum and T.J.

His evolution as a character is by far one of the most satisfying to watch because he managed to succeed despite all the shit in his upbringing, despite everyone assuming the worst of him and his future.

&amp;#x200B;

As a whole, I strongly believe that Jess is one of the most complex and fascinating characters in GG even though he doesn't appear often. I feel like this sub especially focuses on Jess's negative character traits so I wanted to explain why I love the character and have a varying perception of him. Of course his complexity owes a lot to Milo Ventimiglia whose incredible acting managed to show the vulnerable side to Jess too.",91,1,False,self,,,,,

While he may have never been in her life for long periods of time he was the one who continued to show up the most. Jess was the boy who maybe could have been? Maybe got away?

When she was stuck in a rut with a boyfriend who did not compliment her intelligence or potential (Dean) Jess came along to show her that not all guys are yes men and he challenged her mentally. 
When rory was living only to please people, the town, her mother, Jess showed her a sense of adventure and possibility. For example, the episode where they meet in New York and she experiences, from what we know, a life outside of Stars Hollow and Hartford. 
When Rory is lost with a boyfriend who treats her like an after thought or another pretty penny who's father and family convinces Rory that she is less than worthy Jess comes along, a new man with his life together, to show Rory that any situation can be turned around. 
Jess was a constant reminder to Rory that no matter what her life is like or her mother or her grandparents there is always another option. He was her witty reader and her equal in love for literature, her bad boy, her rags to riches, her hipster dream. 
Every girl has a Jess. A worthy guy who they are not currently with but often think, what if?

I'm curious to know how she would've reacted. We get to see Emily and Richard's reactions, but never Francine's, yet we know Chris and his mother are regularly in contact with each other--for example, in ""To Whom It May Concern,"" he mentions that he's dropped Gigi off at his mother's. I feel like there are several opportunities where they could've brought her back. I have the impression that Christopher is an only child, so they could have shown her spending Christmas with them, or they could've shown Christopher and Lorelai breaking the news of their marriage to her upon their return from France, etc. (I also can't help but think that Francine may have disapproved of sending Gigi off to France to stay with Sherry.) I assume that if we would've ever made it to the belated wedding ceremony that Emily was planning that Francine would've been invited. I'm always sad that we don't get to see that event.

Not overall, just in regards to the way she treats/""handles"" Emily. I get that her relationship with her mother is often touch-and-go, but Emily is CLEARLY freaking the hell out the entire episode, and Lorelai is just a bunch of trite comments and ""managing"" her mother's mood swings, and even though there's been plenty of character evidence in the past that Emily deals with emotional stuff by micro-managing everything, Lorelai still has to have it freaking spelled out for her that her mom isn't, in fact, an ice queen who wants to eat a lot of fish, all of a sudden.

&amp;#x200B;

Lorelai seems to be generally... insensitive? I guess? in regards to death/health problems, in general. There are two times she's not a clomping, self-involved jerk about death, and both of them are for people she wants to hook up with--Luke's uncle dies, Christopher's father dies, and suddenly she remembers grieving is a thing people do when death happens, and they do it in various ways. But when... what's her name? The previous owner of the Dragonfly dies? She and Sookie barge in on the freaking funeral to ask for the rites to buy the inn. Richard is having serious heart complications and Emily is trying to get their affairs in order before the VERY REAL possibility of him dying occurs and she won't be ABLE to handle it, and Lorelai can't look past her own judgmental view of her mother.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that their relationship is tense, I get that stuff has just happened to Lorelai. When your husband of multiple decades/nearly all of your adult life is potentially dying, you don't have to consider whether your methods of grief are ""acceptable"". I guess I'm more irked by the fact that the show needed to have it basically spelled out for Lorelai that her mother was actually affected by her husband's heart attack.",8,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

But we just finished the series yesterday, and I have a straight up rant, so please feel free to ignore . Ill probably get downvoted because I feel like this sub is pretty pro-Chris, but oh well hahah. 

Ive always been in the category that while I dont actually want them together in the end, I was 100% okay with Lorelai and Chris giving it a try even though I didnt like the circumstances behind them getting together or getting married. Maybe it was because I was with first time watchers who were pissed by the obvious plot points, but holy crap I was just mad almost every time Chris came on the screen the last two seasons, and that hasnt happened before. Normally his charm saves him for a while until 7x12 and levels off my negative feelings towards him, but it did not work this time. So, my rant (and dont take this as Lorelai getting a pass for her part in a lot of these, the sub just calls her out more often so Im leaving it alone):

1. We know hes not a great father for most of Rorys life because he even tells us that throughout the series, but yes, he obviously is better during the show than he had been even though there are still hiccups. 

2. I think he loves Rory, but he cares more about Lorelai. In season 1 instead of standing up to Straub and checking on Rory, he checks on and sleeps with Lorelai. In season 5, Rory tells him to stay away from Lorelai and let her be happy which he is willing to do until he thinks he has a chance with her. But very soon after, he doesnt care about Rorys feelings about it and does what he wants to get Lorelai instead, hurting his relationship with Rory at the same time. Same in season 6/7 when he and Lorelai dont take Rory into account when they sleep together and get married without her. I dont think his entire relationship with Rory is dependent on his status with Lorelai, but I do think his relationship with Lorelai is more important to him, which is why when its negative its also generally negative with Rory. 

3. When he thinks he has a chance with Lorelai, he cares way more about himself and getting her than he does about Lorelais feelings. In season 5 he knows shes happy and in a relationship, but as soon as Emily tells him to take his chance, he couldnt care less about her happiness and full well is fine with destroying her relationship. And in an absurdly sleazy move, he takes advantage of her being distraught and literally hours out of her being engaged sleeps with her. He knows this may be his chance, so he takes it instead of being a good friend and waiting for her to not be so emotional. On top of this, even though she absolves him of it when they break up, he wont leave her alone and let her deal with her breakup and instead pressured her until she went out with him. He saw his chance and took it without much regard to her actual feelings on the situation. 

4. Random season 7 - Is a jealous asshole when he sees her holding Doula, and throws a fit that carries over when she doesnt want to have a kid then and there. Gets mad because Sookie brings Lukes coffee... He takes off with no contact after he starts a fight because hes mad he cant handle the situation he actively pushed them into. He knew he was her rebound, thought he would be okay with it because he just wanted her, and when he realizes he cant deal with it, he takes off when shes begging him to stay and wants to fix it. I get it was a brutal situation for him and he overestimated what he could deal with, but cmon. 

5. 7x13 - obviously an asshole when he turns his phone off and isnt there for Lorelai or Rory. Even worse when hes an asshole to Luke, and then he manages to stay one whole hour before he takes off again for two days with no contact to his wife or daughter who are dealing with a really tough situation. 

6. The million other immature or stupid things he does throughout the series, and that he thinks money is the solution to everything after he gets the inheritance. 

Sorry for the rant! But Ive always thought he was charming and their chemistry is good (although I dont think season 6-7 is close to how good it was in 1-2), but apart from that, theres so much that pisses me off. So when his charm wore off early for me, it made me really annoyed. I always feel like Im missing something when I see so much positivity about him sometimes but I just cant get there. Probably similar to how some dont like a lot of Lorelai or Rory as characters. Anyone else?

But I think I finally decided, I absolutely hate Luke and Lorelai together. As friends, they were entertaining and funny to watch, but in a relationship Luke has no idea how to treat Lorelai. Ill point out the things that bug me the most.

1) He reacts to Christophers instigation at Richard and Emilys vow renewal by breaking up with Lorelai because its too much for him. Lorelai has always told him how awful Emily can be, and she was honest about having lunch with Chris at the Dragonfly (although not the tequila night), but even then, Lorelai and Chris were just friends with a history. Luke shouldve known and been able to see how much Lorelai was against what Chris said, but he literally left her so quickly. 

2) He got so mad when Lorelai bought his fathers boat, but instead of talking about it maturely, he quipped something about her never listening to him and stormed off, and then showed up at Miss Pattys later to apologize. It seems like total gaslighting.

3) He has a meltdown and acts like a child when Chris calls during the dinner at Lorelais newly renovated house. He storms off and then when Lorelai comes to see him he makes a quip about Gee whens that gonna happen? When Lorelai says something about the wedding, which makes no sense and is really cruel.

4) He didnt tell her about April. That to me is just so unforgivable and I cant imagine how Lorelai wouldve felt. And instead of being truly apologetic about not telling her, he delays the wedding. Lorelai was so happy to have everything planned and done and Luke just postpones it with barely a second thought.

5) Instead of having a mature conversation with Lorelai about wanting to wait to introduce the two, Luke throws a fit about how April is going to like Lorelai too much and its too soon for them to hangout blah blah blah.

6) Hes a jerk to Dean on the double date, and he acts like an asshole most of the weekend they go to Marthas vineyard. Lorelai nearly begging Luke to tell her he loves her sometimes really breaks my heart.

Theres others, but those are just the ones that come to mind. Im not a fan of Dean, but I think Dean treated Rory better than Luke treats Lorelai when theyre a couple. Hes moody, doesnt know how to have conversations, and seems emotionally immature. I just absolutely dislike Luke as Lorelais s.o. She seems too good for him.
