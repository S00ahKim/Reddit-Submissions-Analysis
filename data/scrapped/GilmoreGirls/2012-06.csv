(Possible spoilers if you haven't seen it all),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/uvp08/luke_only_loved_lorelei_until_he_had_her_possible/,[deleted],1339390319,"I'm rewatching Gilmore Girls again, for the... I don't know, eighth time? I'm only at season 06, episode 17: I'm OK, You're OK. And I noticed something I have never noticed before.

I've always been a Lorelei/Luke fan. I always thought those two characters belonged together. Their first kiss is still one of my favorite moments in the series. But something has been bothering me this time around.

Thus far, I've only heard the characters say I love you once. In season 06, episode 15 (A Vineyard Valentine), Luke tells Lorelei that he loves her and *is* going to marry her. But this is the only time (thus far) that either of them have said Love to each other (though it's entirely possible they're saying it all the time between the scenes). I do recall that further into this season, Lorelei says she loves Luke to him.

On top of that, aside from going on dates and occasional unconvincing kisses (with a few convincing ones mixed in), they never seem really that into each other. Well, that's not true. Lorelei seems really into Luke. But Luke seems like Lorelei isn't even that important to him, **especially** after April shows up. I understand he was confused and trying to get to know his daughter. But completely cutting Lorelei out of that part of his life feels like he was intentionally trying to drive her away (even though it was probably not a conscious decision on his part). And don't even get me started on Anna. UGH. It feels like he got bored with her after they were dating for a few months.

When they get back together at the end of the series, those handful of moments seem more passionate and believable than most of their moments together post-April. And that's a large part of why I think there needs to be a movie (even made-for-TV) or specials or mini-series or something to wrap the series up. I still feel like I'm left hanging.

**tl;dr**: It feels like Luke pined after Lorelei for years, and then intentionally tried to drive her away when they got together because he didn't really love her.
