I remember that scene - with the ""your boobs are totally bigger"" fight - playing during commercials while I was watching TV, and announcing ""I really want to watch that.""

When it started I was in 8th grade and my sister was away at her first year of college.  GG became a thing that my mother &amp; I watched together almost every single week (occasionally she'd go to bed earlier than the show).  As much as I love my mother, it was a lot for her to put her own irritations aside long enough to watch TV much less a show not made specifically for her.  But she enjoyed it.

When I went to college in 2005, 8hrs away from home, my sister lived 5 minutes away.  She'd come pick me up every Tuesday (and later Thursday) night... she'd cook dinner at her house and we'd watch GG together. Every year I got a couple more seasons on DVD for christmas.

When GG was canceled, my sister and I had both moved back to my mother's.  The first time we felt a chill in the air after summer, we both had the reaction Lorelai has to snow.  We could feel it in our bones - *it's time for Gilmore Girls.*  So we'd break out my DVD set, sit down, and binge watch the entire series over the course of the next few weeks.  We even wound up moving out of our mother's house and renting a place together, where we continued the tradition every fall.

Two years ago, we both moved to separate places, and coincidentally that was the first year GG appeared on Netflix!  So now we both keep it on constant rotation.  We watch plenty of other things, of course, but we're always *somewhere* in the series.  We don't line our episodes up or do it on purpose, we're both just always somewhere in the series.

A few things to keep in mind:

* I probably missed a lot!
* I may have gotten some incorrect, or listed something I thought was a reference but was actually just made up for the script.
* I listed brand-name items when I could, even though some may not consider them ""cultural references"".
* There are many common items that repeat throughout episodes (Yale, the DAR, etc.). I tried to list them for every episode they're mentioned in, but I probably missed quite a few.
* I tried to keep formatting consistent. So I would list what they're referencing, and then put what was actually said in the script in parentheses. 
* I also tried to list the songs played in the soundtrack, or list books/magazines/TV shows/movies they were reading/watching, even if not directly mentioned in the script. Again, probably missed a lot.

Please feel free to mention anything I overlooked and correct my mistakes in the comments!

I got up before 5 am and thought to myself, today 16 years ago this show made it's way into my life and settled forever in my heart. I was merely 10 years old, a few weeks shy of 11, when I got hooked (almost around the same time I started drinking coffee). I grew up in a Hispanic household and drinking coffee is pretty much a day to day activity, several times a day in fact. I was very close to my mother and always felt we shared more than just a mother-daughter relationship. I feel that especially inspired me to be as attached as I became to the series. 

I remember getting upset during the cliffhangers at the end of the seasons, yelling at the television when I disagreed with something that was going on in the show or a decision our girls made. I laughed whenever Emily made a cheeky remark which was often. I cried whenever Lorelai got emotional over her father and their complicated relationship as I myself had struggled with the same over the years. 

The show was always there for me, to make me laugh and make me cry. It became part of who I am and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I started watching Gilmore Girls in about 2005. I was only 10, and probably didn't understand a lot of what was going on. I caught up through ABC Family's reruns, and soon found myself having watched those show multiple times all the way through. My dad, who knew not to disturb me from 5-6, decided to sit down one day and watch. He was hooked. This was a gruff, carpenter. A manly man. A Tom. He loved the show and watched every day with me.  
In 2010, my dad passed away after a long battle with cancer. He lived out the last few months of his life in the hospital. He made a deal with the nurses to not come in between 5 and 6 so he could watch Gilmore Girls. He called me at the beginning, we stayed in silence during the show, and then discussed during the commercial breaks. One day, after watching the final episode for the 3rd or so time, he said 'I hate this ending. It feels unnatural. Rory deserves more. Also, when you get older, find a man who has all the best qualities of Rory, Jess, and Logan, and who can cook like a Luke'.

- Lorelai has a male visitor staying the night. It was seriously weird and wrong to wake up your kid because you're having problems sleeping next to a guy. It's just weird. Call Sookie, instead!
- Rory being incredibly rude to Emily during Friday night dinner. This was after the wedding incident. She was mad because Emily was the indirect reason of Lorelai's and Luke's breakup. And afterwards, Lorelai defended Rory for being rude. Rory was not part of what happened directly and she shouldn't have acted like that to her grandmother.

Emily and Richard have orchestrated a cocktail party for Rory to meet a young man that they consider more suitable for her than Dean after recently learning that she has gotten back together with him. They invite only their Yale alumni friends with eligible sons. Based on the interactions between the guests of the party, it is my assumption that the only person left in the dark about this party's theme is Rory herself. Jordan who talks to Rory on the patio tells that Emily thinks they are made for each other. He further says, ""There's nothing like having your family play matchmaker."" Logan then swoops in to 'save' her from Jordan and the boring party. My question is this: Why would Mitchum and Shira voluntarily bring their son to this party with the purpose of matchmaking Logan with Rory when they are shown, very obviously, to find her unacceptable in later episodes?

He crashes Rory's car, doesn't bother to pay (!!!!!!), and get one for himself?! What? Not having any social skills and relying your rebellion on a leather jacket is something, but this is straight on lack of character.

Edit: IMO, it doesn't matter if insurance/Richard/Christopher covered the costs, a decent person would go after and repay the damage (usually, even with insurance, you need to pay a starter amount to get the whole thing rolling). He did nothing. Didn't really apologize (poor him, he was feeling so sad already. That must have been enough), no envelope with any amount of cash he had at the moment, and bought a car for himself later. That's so shitty.

When Lorelai calls Chilton to ask about the tuition she has to pay, the photos in the background on the shelf show her and Rory. Some of them look like promo photos they obviously took for the show--and one of them is of her and Rory at Luke's. Lorelai is in a purple sweater and Rory in a red and black top.

Later we see Lorelai in front of the shelf again and different photos have been added (baby photos, and the image of her as a child at her parent's home) and the 'Luke's' image isn't there anymore.

That missing photo is clearly of Lorelai and Rory from the scene in the pilot where they argue in the diner because Rory may not want to go to Chilton anymore (because she met Dean). Also, I noticed that in that scene when Lorelai tosses the money on the table to pay for dinner, it falls on the ground.

After Lorelei and Rory, Sookie also gets pregnant when Jackson lies about getting a vasectomy, and then again lane gets pregnant after her first time with zach! Abortion is never considered or mentioned with Sookie or Lane, which really stands out to me. 


In Loralei's case she was pressured to have an abortion by her parents and Chris's parents and she chose not to. But she was never interested in the life that her parents wanted for her anyway and this was a catalyst for her to find her independence (at the independence inn of all places) and start her own life. It is also interesting that she is the only one who doesn't end up romantically involved with the father- though this is not 100% by choice. 


Sookie's situation is the most frustrating to me. I think that it portrays Jackson as jus a blundering awkward guy who didn't know how to say no to sookie's request that he get a vasectomy, justifying his choice to skip it and not tell her and still have unprotected sex! Of course Sookie was mad but she forgave him and struggled through caring for two children. I think if this aired on tv today it would spark a dialog on consent/ making sure everyone is agreeing to the same thing when they agree to have sex, even when you are already married. 


I thought it was kind of lovely that lanes pregnancy brought her so close with Mrs Kim, exactly the opposite of what happened to Loralei. That being said, it was the third time using this device and I thought it might be lazy writing. And I thought she was so much better with Adam broady's character than with Zach so it seemed a bit like the bbs forced her to settle because she couldn't do it alone. I hope that she got to go back to her band-girl life. 





I think in some ways this characterizes the town of stars hallow: people are hardworking and good people who don't ""take shortcuts"" and are ""too gentle"" to consider abortion. (This is not how I view it at all which is why I put the quotation marks! Just trying to guess what the show might be aiming for.) And they're there for each other when problems arise, like how Rory was raised by the town in a lot of ways. Also, the show has an old-fashioned/ frozen in time vibe so I don't think abortion would be available there, let alone accepted.  



I also wonder about the time that it was created - was it just less accepted to talk about abortion on tv? Why is everyone so clueless about other forms of birth control? Why did they knock up lane?  I watched it when it aired but I was a lot younger and didn't think about these things - and wasn't really aware of what was acceptable on mainstream tv. They stood out more to me on a recent rewatch.

I enjoy Dean the most in the first couple of episodes his in, particularly when jumps on the bus (even though Rory makes me cringe), but I also actually really appreciate him when he breaks up with Rory at the dance marathon. 

Least favorite is pretty hard cause I feel the hate with a lot of moments, but I think it's between him lying to Rory about how him and Lindsey are done and how he treats Lindsey at home. Although honorable mentions for their sad dates at Dooses and his parents house.

He got overwhelmed by his kid coming out of nowhere, and asked to postpone the wedding. Lorelai said that was ok, didn't talk about it, then just EXPLODED out of nowhere, said  you need to marry me right now, he was totally taken aback, and then she cheated on him and MARRIED ANOTHER MAN. 

Getting drunk and singing karaoke just does not cut it in my books.

I guess it's not uncommon for shows to have some crossover but it felt like a lot with Alex Borstein, Rosa Abdoo, Keiko Agena, Sherilyn Fenn, the girl that plays Francie, and even the woman that cut out lunch at The Dragonfly plays Fiona's coworker.  I also feel like there are just a couple of similarities in the writing style and the neighborhood feel of the show (even though I'm sure you could guess where I'd rather live). I think there are a few episodes in the first season that Alex Borstein wrote too, and while I don't think she ever wrote for Gilmore Girls, I feel like she's part of the Palladino family. 

So I'm curious if anyone else watches Shameless and loves seeing the familiar faces. I also found it really interesting to see a lot more of Emily Bergl (Francie/Sammi) since we really don't get much development from her in Gilmore Girls.

Perhaps manipulative isn't the right word, more that it had a lot of strings attached to it. It's always brought up - by other characters and also by Dean himself - as example of what a good boyfriend he was. It's used as a justifiable reason for him to get mad at Rory. 

When Rory and Jess had the car crash, she was worried how Dean would react. I've also seen people mention how disrespectful it was of Rory to let someone else drive the car Dean made. But it was her car! It was a gift! Once someone gives a gift, that person can then do anything they like with it. They can use it, put it in a cupboard and forget about it and even give it away if they so desire. Isn't the purpose of a gift meant to show a person how much they mean to you/give them the joy of something they'll like? It's not meant to be about the giver. It's nice to know the person appreciates your gift, of course it is, but in the end once the gift is given, it belongs to the receiver. 

I understand that Dean worked hard on the car and put a lot of effort and love into it, but surely that was to show his feelings to Rory, not to dictate how she used it. I personally don't think Rory should ever have had to justify how or when she used the car.

Is it different if the person is someone who was around a lot before the break up? Is it better or worse if it's just a hook up? Or is the person completely free to move on the second the relationship is over?

Whether you want to discuss it in the context of the show (Logan and the bridesmaids, Lorelai and Chris sleeping together, Rory and Jess after Dean breaks up with her, maybe Chris and Sherry?) or with personal examples, I think it'd be interesting to discuss because it seems likes the rules are very ambiguous once the actual break up has taken place.

I think Lorelai's sleeping with Chris is pretty awful even though technically there is nothing wrong, but would it have been different if she waited a week to sleep with him? And Logan too, is a minimum of three women in a few month span just too many? Is thanksgiving too close to the time that they broke up? I don't necessarily fault him for sleeping with who wanted, but Rory is clearly hurt by this, and I don't think she would have gotten back with him had she known.

Also, when Rory gets home, Lorelai tells Rory she's sure Dean will understand that Rory lost the bracelet but Rory is unconvinced(as am I, following the ugly freak out).

I think this is one of the episodes that shows us how similar Lorelai and Emily really is. And how Lorelai thinks of herself as Rory's friend first.

Lorelai needed to know about Rory's first kiss and not wanting to wait for Rory to be ready to tell her. Can't she wait? The moment she saw Rory she tried to make Rory talk about it. It's similar how Emily wants to know things about Lorelai's life without waiting. Some would say it's different because Lorelai seems sweeter. Still, she's asking for something that her daughter wasn't ready to tell her yet.


This conversation that was hilarious to me:

L: Well, I just invited a friend of yours to hang out. What's the big deal? What if Lane had done it?

R: You're not Lane. You're my mother.


Lorelai seems to forget at times that she's Rory's mother. Also, it was creepy how she was 'checking out' dean in the grocery store. Telling Rory about his eyes and asking about his behind. Ugh, no. Please. Stop. 

The next part of the conversation:

R: You inviting him over is like grandma inviting a guy you liked over.

L: You're comparing me to my mother? &amp;nbsp;

R: No, I'm just - &amp;nbsp;

L: I'm Emily Gilmore now? My, how the mighty have fallen! &amp;nbsp;

R: I didn't mean that &amp;nbsp;

L: I wasn't trying to humiliate you. &amp;nbsp;

R: I know. &amp;nbsp;

L: If I was Emily Gilmore, I'd be trying to humiliate you. &amp;nbsp;


This take on Emily by Lorelai. She thinks whatever her mother does it is to humiliate her. I find it terribly sad. Emily has done bad things throughout the series but the idea of humiliating her daughter is probably the least of her concerns. It's also terrible that she's telling things like this to her daughter.  It's bad enough the she only gets to hear one side so it's stuck in Rory's head how bad her grandparents are. Which I have to say is so true in real life when it comes to family issues. The kids get involved in it and they hear things from one side or the other.

Sherri pointing out that there was no obligation that lorelei and her *needed* to be friends was a nice thing. That if they ended up liking each other, great, but if they didn't, also just fine.

Best: This is really hard because she has a ton of one liners that are hilarious even if she's not exactly being a good person when she says them, but I think I enjoy seeing her with Jamie in DC. 

Worst: How she breaks up with Jamie. I feel so bad that he was in New Haven to see her and she doesn't even meet with him once and then just quickly breaks up with him over the phone. I'm almost glad they didn't show a dejected Jamie get in his car and leave, cause I think I'd feel even worse about this moment.

Then he calls later and leaves her 14 messages. That's terrifying. If I were Rory's parent, I'd be really concerned. 

I feel like this whole season we watch Rory feel all this intense guilt over pulling away from Dean and having feelings for Jess, as if Dean is the sweet, nice guy she should be with. But really? Why does Lorelai even put up with Dean? She keeps pushing Dean, as if he's so much better than Jess. Dean is controlling, manipulative and in no way supportive of Rory. He whines when she has schoolwork or family obligations and just generally is a jerk to her about spending time with friends. It feels really abusive to me. Like when he breaks up with her for not saying I love you back to him immediately, then almost doesn't get back together with her because she's JUST TALKING to Tristan?

I love this show, but man is it normalizing a textbook emotionally abusive relationship! He's awful!

Curious about moments that reflect on the character's ethics or even just how you felt about them as a viewer.

**Best:** As a viewer, I love the scene where she moves out Mrs. Kim's house, but for Lane's character, I think I love the moment she discovers she loves the drums, or when she first meets Dave.

**Worst:** I think her accepting Zack's proposal seems like a bad choice for Lane, but she also really bugs with all of the Henry Cho stuff (completely fabricated issue on her part) and sometimes her rants are a little annoying.

Luke throws her daughter, April, a birthday party. The party isn't going so well, so she calls Lorelei to come help him. With the help of Lorelei the party becomes a hit and it even turns into a slumber party! 

Luke sleeps downstairs and the girls sleep upstairs, which I thought was a perfectly smart arrangement. However this is a huge problem for Anna. Teasing being that she doesn't know the woman, blah blah blah.

Now, I'm a 23 year old dude, so maybe I don't see the problem, but I think this is a huge over reaction, ridiculous even. So you let a man you haven't seen in 12 year throw your daughter a party, but as soon as he brings the girlfriend along, its a big no no. 

The whole time I'm thinking, well, the children called home to ask if they can sleep over? They knew that the party was thrown by the father of April, not the mother. 

Maybe its just me, but I feel a hell a lot more comfortable as a parent if there was a motherly figure available, instead of only a clueless single guy. And if the parents are fine with leaving their daughters at a man they have never met, I'm sure they wouldn't mind his partner.

She chased down the guy at the paper where she had interned, fighting for a job. She hunted down professors to lobby for a seat in full classes. She was taking charge, no longer expecting everything to be handed to her. I got the impression we were supposed to think her final response to Mitchim's criticism was to be more assertive, and fight for what she wants.

But then, in the scene where she is voted editor of the Yale Daily News, it's back to her being handed everything because of her bambi eyes. I mean, someone else had to nominate her because she didn't put in her own name. An amazing opportunity opened up, and she didn't even lift a finger to snatch it up. Then, of course, someone handed the editorship to Princess Rory on a platter and she blushed and stammered and took it.

It just feels like a step backward to me. One of the most annoying things about early Rory is how everything seems to just be handed to her, and I used to think that the big meltdown was when she figured it out and started taking initiative for herself. But this time around (3rd rewatch for me), this scene is really bothering me.

Their easy camaraderie, the way he included her in GiGi's life, his showing up to squire her at Lane's wedding. Chris was there for her this season, and Luke was a bumholio.

I know Luke is endgame for Lorelai. I know the Chris thing will sputter out in season seven.

Amongst other things, I always thought she had great comedic timing and her character and her characters reactions to people/events felt genuine (Logan leaving at the end of season 6...so. many. onions.)

Sure, her hugs were a little off and there are some scenes that I felt she could have acted better but I also wonder what her direction was for those scenes and if they were so poorly acted, did a director step in and say so?

Anyway, I've really come to love Rory through re-watching the series (thanks to Bledel and the scripts) and just wanted to spread some of that love.

**Best:** There are definitely a handful of lines that he has that I know I love but can't recall right now, but I liked his stuff with Lane's glasses ""of course she doesn't think that, she's really smart, she's just not wearing her glasses"" and I love the way he bonds with mrs. kim over it. I also love how stoked Zack gets on working on that song with Mrs. Kim. And of course he becomes a really good husband as time goes on.

**Worst:** When he's hitting on Lorelai. When he's being an asshole to Gil about his age. When he gets insanely jealous about Brian and ruins their show.

She kisses Jess while with Dean, never tells Dean about it, and doesn't break up with him after it happens even though she should. She's not honest with her feelings in this relationship and even though it could be chalked up to inexperience, it's still really unfair to Dean.
2) She constantly compares Jess to Dean despite knowing that the two of them do not like one another and don't get along. She expects Jess to treat her like Dean, but doesn't even like the way Dean treated her in the first place so this is kind of silly. She claims Jess won't talk to her about anything, but doesn't realize that when he does try and talk to her she dismisses what he's saying by comparing him to her ex boyfriend in conversations in which her ex boyfriend comes out more positively.
3) Rory's relationship issues with Dean wind up repeating in her relationship with Logan.

I'm watching the whole series again for the 5th or so time, but it's the first time doing so in my 20s so I'm thinking a lot about their adult relationships.

Particularly Luke and Logan.

And I just realized that Rory and Lorelai kind of suck at relationships. I mean they're both great women with a ton to offer, but when it comes to communication they're really bad, which is funny considering communication/talking is kind of their thing. 

Lorelai should have just said she wasn't ok with canceling the wedding and that she needed to meet April and that she was feeling neglected. She also should have told Luke about Chris prior to the wedding.

Rory should not have assumed that if you get in a HUGE fight with your boyfriend and then don't talk to him for WEEKS you're just taking time off. Sounds more like ghosting out of a relationship to me...

Then after they're back together she fails AGAIN to communicate with Logan about what he did when they were apart so they could heal and instead took the childish route of avoiding him, embarrassing him at the paper, and treating him poorly as retaliation.  

I kind of feel bad for Luke and Logan even though I'm a girl and usually side with Rory and Lorelai. Luke and Logan both tried very hard to change to become the men the girls needed, but they can't read minds.

(If you haven't seen seasons 6 or 7, spoilers ahead)

Lorelai has yet to say no to a marriage proposal during the show (I'm ignoring the pre-series Chris proposal when Rory was born). I mean, Max asks and she's all ""Sure, man."" She dates Luke for not very long (it seems) and suddenly she's proposing to him while he's mid-rant. Chris pops the question in Paris and after five minutes of dithering she's eloping with the guy. Lorelai has agreed to marry anyone that asks her, sometimes when even she knows it's not right and she's not actually in love with him. (I know she proposed to Luke, but even then it felt like her jumping in without thinking it through fully, to take her mind off of the situation with Rory).

Then Rory is so much more likely to say no. Jess asks her to run away with him and girl is like ""Hells no, bro"". Logan does this huge public proposal and she is having none of it, and in that case she had been living with the boy and dated him for years. I don't think Dean proposed, but I can totally see her telling him no over pop-tarts. Rory knows how to turn a boy down.

Does this mean something bigger about the differences in their characters? Lorelai is more of an optimist? Rory is less trusting when it comes to relationships because her childhood lacks a steady relationship example? But Lorelai had Richard and Emily as an example of a strong relationship so she's subconsciously more trusting of marriage than she realizes?

Or they are just looking for different things in life? Rory wants adventure and Lorelai has always wanted to find a partner and settle down?

**Worst:** The LOTR party prep, demanding to sign off on the sink (or stove?) and then bailing on it, her craziness over lunch, how quick she is to assume Lorelai isn't committed to Luke (despite never doing this with the other boyfriends), and demanding her husband get a vasectomy.

Starting with Dean, I never was convinced that Rory really loved him, I think she really liked him and were genuinely happy for a while when she was still a kid, but  she thought love was a completely different thing. Dean loved Rory way more than she ever loved him and I guess she felt guilty about it.

Jess was a wrecking ball in her life, everything changed for her when he came around, I guess it was a huge infatuation, the mind blowing kind that shake all of your structures. Despite that, Rory never said she loved Jess, she never returned his declaration and after season 4 seemed like completely over him.

Logan seemed to win Rory's full heart, she said over and over how much she loved him, but in the end, this huge love seemed to fade away a little, when she stopped being impressed by him and his attitudes.

Could ASP really give up even more than this and still keep the story in tact? I guess we'll have to see how we actually feel about the revival, but I'd be worried about them trying to do much with it, especially since it sounds like they pulled out all of the stops for this one.

Curious about moments that reflect on the character's ethics or even just how you felt about them as a viewer.

**Best:** I think my favorite moment is his reaction to Rory dropping out of school, and I also think the boat selling thing was a huge step for him that I really appreciated seeing. 

**Worst:** I think I'm going to have to go with not telling his fiance about his new kid OR getting mad at Lorelai for trying to ease things over with Anna. But I guess ultimately the second moment wouldn't have needed to happen if Luke had treated Lorelai like a partner.

**Stars Hollow-ish World**

* Liz
* TJ
* Miss Patty
* Babette
* Morey
* Taylor
* Gypsy
* Kirk
* Jackson
* Brian
* Gil
* Michel
* Dave
* Andrew
* Reverend Nichols
* April
* Anyone else I forgot to mention in the Stars Hollow area

*I originally put Anna on this list, but took her off because I assumed no one really had a best moment for her, and it hardly seemed necessary to get into her worst qualities but if you do please feel free to share it.*


**Bests:** I love Babette ragging on Rory for her whimpy kiss with Jess. I love pretty much everything Kirk does, most notably his movie and the weird dance performance he does. I loved the line where Gypsy tells Lorelai she supports her in the break up while blatantly insulting her knowledge of cars. I love how grateful Gil is to just play the one time with the band. Brian when he learns about Korean culture for the lunar new year. And when the reverend turns a blind eye to Lorelai and Luke breaking the bells.

**Worsts:** I kind of love Taylor, but I hate the whole street name fiasco with a passion, because there is no way that isn't bad for tourism. I find Jackson at his peak annoyingness when he gets mad at Rory for not including the two of them in the giant pizza. And I kind of hate most of the time Liz tries to give her brother advice because it's almost always kind of bad.

I just don't quite get it. Yes, it was a great letter but I'm not sure why he reacted as though it were some sort of torrid love letter. I'm just trying to imagine how a normal person would react to that letter and I'm unconvinced that it was such a huge deal. 

Yes, it highlighted the fact that someone other than Christopher had been a father-figure (and a more constant one at that) in Rory's life. So I can see him being upset that someone else was doing his job, but that's his fault, not Lorelai's. And it isn't exactly news to him that he was an absentee father.

And yes, it said Luke would always be in Lorelai's life. But given that she doesn't speak to him or even go to his diner anymore, I can't see that being a deal breaker either. It's not like she's hanging out with him, or even having non-awkward run-ins with him in the town. She doesn't even talk about Luke. If she were constantly comparing Luke and Chris, or bringing up anecdotes about her time with Luke, I'd get that. But she never even mentions him.

So why did Chris suddenly feel like the letter made it plain that he was Lorelai's rebound from Luke? I mean, he knew the situation when she came to him the night she broke up with Luke. He dated her for months, and then HE was the one pushing to get married in Paris, to buy a new house together, to have a baby. And then he reads a letter about how Luke was a great friend to Rory, and his marriage is over? 

Am I just not understanding the letter? Was it as big a deal as Chris thought? Was it a love letter?",27,29,False,self,,,,,

We don't see a ton of times that Lorelai actually makes a lot of sacrifices for Luke. And we have a few moments where Luke asks for something and Lorelai is unable to do it, like him wanting space in their season 5 break up, Lorelai buying the boat, and of course Luke wanting postpone the wedding for April stuff.

I know that especially with the April stuff that what he asking for isn't fair to Lorelai, but considering the fact that Lorelai not only postpones their wedding for her own daughter, she also gets on his case for interacting with Rory, all while he very patiently waits it out while Lorelai isn't exactly dealing with it in a way that he agrees with.

I don't know if these are the shining examples of where Lorelai should compromise, but I almost struggle to picture any scenario where Lorelai would really make any sacrifices for something Luke wants. Does Lorelai really need to be in a relationship that doesn't have their own sense of agency in life?

I think all fans know the actor is dead so.....

We know the series starts in Winter and it has been 4 months since Richard's passing. That puts his passing in August, September, or October.

That means the Summer or Fall episode could feature the first anniversary of Richard's death. It's so obvious but this just occurred to me and now has me thinking how it will play out. It HAS to be featured, right?

NOTE: I'm completely guessing from here on out... if you have facts about timing please post them!

I'm thinking ASP will want to do a First Snow moment, so Winter will probably be early December, putting Richard's passing in early August. I'm thinking each ""episode"" will span multiple weeks rather than just one day in each season. They could have Summer in July and Fall in September and have it happen off screen.. but it seems odd to not feature the funeral, his birthday, OR the one year anniversary.... Do you think Winter could span enough time to feature First Snow in December and Richard's birthday in January?

With Richard's birthday in January.. so the series could start there, which would put it in September.. This could mean a nice bookend of starting the series with his birthday and ending it with one year of his passing. If they do this, though.. we'd have a memorial AND the rumored wedding in the same Fall episode. I actually think that would be kinda nice. If it's Lorelai or Rory's wedding, they could visit the grave and think about how he could have been walking them down the aisle. One chapter ending and another beginning. Bittersweet moments.

Other timeline things to consider.. 
If it ends in September, that would leave out Rory's birthday. You still have Lorelai's in April, and April also has an April birthday. And I just realized I don't think they ever talk about or celebrate Emily's birthday! Also of note: Richard and Emily got married in June and their vow renewal was in February. Chilton's bicentennial was in February. Logan's birthday is February. Luke's Dark Day - when he lost HIS father - is November 30.

I know that Rory was on the campaign trail for President Obama and I feel that a slight mention of this seems necessary, but part of the appeal of Gilmore Girls to me is that it isn't overly cemented in real life current events.

It's like half the fandom is under some freaky spell where they can't see Jess for who he really is because he wears leather jackets and gives intense looks and suddenly women who are usually feminists go weak at the knees and start trying to justify his attempted date-rape as immaturity and basically saying ""boys will be boys"". And I'm over here like ""what is happening?! Can nobody see that this kid is scum and rude to boot?""  

The same people who write essays about Dean being ""abusive"" because he gets a little possessive of Rory and calls her a bunch of times (OMG monster) when the girl is emotionally and physically cheating on him, are quick to forgive Jess' similar jealous behaviour (he gives Rory the 3rd degree about hanging out with Dean at Miss Patty's) and his constant shitty treatment of her just because they both like books. It's like that scene in ""They came together"" where Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd meet at a book store and she's all like ""OMG, you like fiction books? I've never met anyone who liked fiction books before! That's crazy!"" It's not like reading is that uncommon of a hobby, she can get a guy who likes to read but who also doesn't try to pressure her into sex, act rude to all her friends and family, or have zero interest in trying to get involved in other aspects of her life to make her happy. I swear, I think his effect on people is pretty disturbing. I don't even like Dean, he's bland as hell, but I always find myself defending him because it is CRAZY the double-standards on condoning Jess' toxic actions and vilifying Dean's.

Don't get me wrong, I understand the appeal of Jess. He is dreamy when he smiles, Milo and Alexis have amazing chemistry, it's pretty cute when they talk about books, and the whole ""bad boy who only softens around you"" trope is one I've fantasized about myself. But defending him is ridiculous. 

I don't want to get inte a Dean vs. Jess argument (I dislike them both for Rory) and people are allowed to ship whoever they want. I mean, I shipped Blair and Chuck and god knows THAT was an unhealthy relationship. I just want to understand if people objectively think that Dean actually treated Rory worse than Jess did. Because to me that is insane. Going back to the Gossip Girl comparison, it's not like I'm all ""but he sold her for a hotel because he loved her! He was just frustrated! He matured!"" Um no. He was a crap boyfriend and I only shipped them because their sexual chemistry was out of this world and I wanted to see the actors on screen together more. (Sorry for those who have not seen GG and have no clue what I'm talking about). My point is, I feel like with Jess nobody will admit that they just like him because he's charming... instead they try to defend his terrible behaviour and justify that him and Rory are soulmates. Dude, no. In real life everyone would agree he was the worst and we all just want to see them make out because they're great TV. Am I wrong??!

* Janet
* Tana
* Doyle
* Mitchum
* Honor
* Colin
* Finn
* Robert
* Madeline and Louise
* Glen
* Trix
* Sherry
* Marty
* Francie
* Nora (the Miss Patty of the DAR)

*This list is pretty much anyone that's not from Stars Hollow and Emily and Richard might actually approve of. If I forgot anyone please feel free to rant or rave about them anyway.*


Curious about moments that reflect on the character's ethics or even just how you felt about them as a viewer.

**Tana:** Love- when she borrows an outfit from Rory and picks her Chilton uniform.

**Doyle:** Love- his first date with Paris, Hate- the whole speech about respecting him as an editor while he is taking off his shoe and sock on her coffee table 

**Mitchum:** Love- how respectful he is to Rory when they meet at his house and at the YDN. Hate- the planning Logan's life comment.

**Honor:** Hate- ""I want you to meet my friend, Rory"" instead of ""I want you to meet Logan's girlfriend""

**Colin and Finn** Hate- Almost everything that comes out of Colin's mouth. Love- the respect they show Rory when they are planning their event at their place and they can tell Rory and Logan need to talk alone.

**Robert:** Like/Love- I appreciated Robert at the Pulp Friction party. He didn't seem like the best dude, but he treated Rory respectfully and he was interesting enough for Rory to have a good time.

**Glenn:** Love- his throw away lines where he is complaining about high profile journalists calling him all of the time

**Trix:** Even though the same actress, but different character said this, I love the line ""This is my granddaughter, Lorelai. She's not married""

**Sherry:** Seriously girl get your shit together and stop being weird to Lorelai and Rory all of the time.

**Marty:** Love- when he tells her to stop being naive about Logan. Hate- how incredibly boring he is, and how he misses at least a couple of opportunities to actually do something proactive about his feelings for Rory.

**Jason:** Love- his nickname for Lorelai at camp (took the GG podcast to explain that one to me), how he gets himself invited to dinner and how he gets both Lorelai and Emily to discuss good date restaurants without Emily noticing. Hate- The fact that he got into a business partnership as a competitor to his own father.

But then I got to thinking that practically every single character (with the exception of a few) are actually *very* sexist, including the women. 

So, I made this thread to talk about sexism in general in Gilmore Girls because I genuinely believe that ASP is sexist and therefore the characters in GG are sexist. For example, this quote by Rory in episode 3x07:
&gt;RORY: There they go again! God, I swear, why cant they just get a room? Or forget a room  get a park bench, or a doorway, or even a strategically placed telephone pole would probably suffice. I mean, girls like Shane  what is it with them? Dont they see what they look like? I know they have mirrors.

And then she goes on to say that Shane ""concerns all women"" as if there is something wrong with Shane's overall existence? Who would you say is the most sexist character in GG and why? For me it's Rory hands down. Edited to Add: The reason why Rory's the most sexist character for me is because she's a self-proclaimed feminist who believes in women's rights, yet she likes Ayn Rand (Rory..... my girl, no lol) and speaks awful of other women who she feels threatened by.

Curious about moments that reflect on the character's ethics or even just how you felt about them as a viewer.

**Best:** Telling off Mitchum for not visiting him, saving the YDN, taking charge of the Jess thing in 322 on the phone. Being a really good friend to Paris after she had sex with Jamie 

**Worst:** How bad she treated Dean (and Shane) when she started falling for Jess, how ungrateful she acted about her time at the Gilmore's, the red head with the ""fat thighs"" comment, throwing a tantrum about the Mitchum comment.

The way they introduced her was beyond stupid and maybe they should have made her a little more dissimilar to Rory, but she's overall a sweet, quirky kid and I loved seeing the joy she brought to Luke's life.

But how the hell does a kid that great happen after being raised by someone as spiteful, selfish and arrogant as Anna? Who makes the decision to leave the state with their child without letting the other parent know this is even on the table? And refuses to even discuss options to make sure that parent is able to stay a part of their child's life?

Tiger Woods' ex-wife made it clear in their custody settlement that their kids couldn't meet any woman in his life until they were engaged. Anna's more strict with Luke (a good, loyal man who like all rational humans dislikes unruly children and didn't deserve to have his daughter's childhood robbed from him) than a woman whose husband publicly humiliated her by cheating on her with a dozen women.

I know people think April broke Luke and Lorelai up, but watching these episodes, all I see is Luke struggling to have a relationship with April while balancing Anna's impossible demands and Lorelai's needs.

**Best:** the house, consigning the loan, telling Lorelai she's a kayak

My thoughts were that since Richard died, Emily became closer and closer to Stars Hollow, and she finally sees the struggle and drama that Lorelai has to go through to get her 'perfect life', which plays a big part in making them close after all the years.

What do you think are the best and worst moments for Lorelai?


Curious about moments that reflect on the character's ethics or even just how you felt about them as a viewer.

I definitely have a tendency to forget how good Lorelai can be sometimes because rewatch after rewatch the negatives just seem to be so much more apparent, but there is definitely an unending list of great moments for Lorelai, just as there may be for the bad.

**Best:** Reaching out to her mom (the dvd player, asking about the veil, offering to ""hang out"", going shopping with her for Rory), always being really supportive of Rory (helping her settle in on her first night of college, staying up all night to study with her after the D, sacrificing her seats at the Bangles concert so Rory can make friends), and being there for her friends (helping Luke with the diner when his uncle died, encouraging Sookie to date Jackson, babysitting for Davey and Gigi, and throwing the funeral for Michel even though he was being self centered).


**Worst:** Sleeping with Chris, Accepting Max's proposal, not telling her mother she was engaged, not telling her mother she's dating her father's business partner, not allowing Rory to live at home when she dropped out of school.

Her reacting in anger doesn't surprise me or strike me as odd, and I think she's entirely in the right to 1) refuse to ""help"" her parents after they sort of threw her concerns to the curb, and 2) be irritated that they did all of that, and that they expect her help now.

What does confuse me is that, when Richard says Rory's not headed back to Yale, Lorelai responds ""not YET anyway!""

It seems like she's changing her stance just to prove her father wrong.  Because, if I recall when this whole schism started, Lorelai's fear was that Rory would lose momentum and *never* return to Yale.  Here Richard is, essentially saying he's seeing the light she saw months ago, and now Lorelai's suggesting that Rory will find her own way back there.

Things I noticed:

* 0:03 - International Food Festival is in Spring
* 0:09 - There is a knit blanket/shawl and a basket of yarn behind her.. is this a new hobby?
* 0:15 - No rings on either girl's fingers
* 0:22 - Sign in the background says 2016
* 0:30 - Sign behind them says Switch to Sewer - likely a town controversy for Taylor! - Looks like maybe guys with shovels in the background?
** Also, are those cups Al's coffee? Doesn't look quite like Luke's.
* 0:47 - Rory sitting outside the house with something in her hand- a to go bag? A letter?
* 0:49 - Rory in her room? There is an Algebra book (Why???) and a doll, plus a picture of her and Lorelai, and a rack of clothes.
* 0:50 - Rory in London
* 0:51 - Rory in NYC at some kinda ComiCon?
* 0:58 - Kirk at FND, Emily not familiar with him? (This matches the scene still where Luke barges in in plaid!)
**Edit: Kirk does NOT have a wedding ring :( -- Looks like there is snow outside and the table setting - Winter
* 1:05 - Gilmore Guys are in the background! They are texting, there's a guy on a balance ball, and everyone looks young. What kind of event is the Inn having? Looks like Spring.
* 1:07 - Hand holding scene in same outfits as the movie scene, which we've also seen in stills. Looks like this is Spring.
* 1:08 - Lorelai hiking? Alone? -- EDIT: She has a little slip of paper in her hand. For some reason my first thought was the horoscope?
* 1:12 - Lorelai questioning happiness with Luke? At a therapist?
* 1:15 - Edit: FUNERAL for Richard. You can see the casket. All 3 girls there - married for 50 years, yet S5 WBB was their 45th? ** Different than the scene still with the 3 girls at the cemetery. Both have green grass.
* 1:28 - Rory at an unidentified house in the same dress she wears to Chilton. A woman comes down the stairs who looks to be wearing a similar outfit as Paris.
* 1:29 - Rory driving, then wearing same outfit while looking over the empty dining room table
* 1:34 - Rory drinking with Jess. Window says ""Stars Hollow ... Publishing Since 199..""
** Computers in the background are very old, old man there as well
** No ring on Jess
* 1:35 - Town Meeting does NOT appear to be at Miss Patty's, but the same set as the Pilgrim scene. There is a bottle next to Taylor that says ""Good Old Dad"" Whiskey.. (in the Pilgrim scene, too). Sam Pancake (new character) is in the front row, along with Lorelai, Babette, and Gypsy. No Luke or Maury. They have clip boards at their feet. This is a different town hall from the one in the still.
* 1:42 - The little birds on the table are the same as the previous Inn scene with the Gilmore Guys, though Lorelai is in a different outfit. Maybe the scene with Michel/Sookie (Lorelai in the same outfit) is the previous day prepping.
* 1:46 - Pig onset for Fall in Stars Hollow
* 1:50 - Rory at Chilton
* 1:54 - Rory and Lorelai dressed as hippies with parasols - Kim's antiques busy in the background
* 1:55 - Rory and Lorelai on the back on Luke's truck, Luke driving (looks like Fall?) Looks like the same dress she's wearing with the ballerinas, which would make it fall. No Ring for Lorelai, but Rory is covering her left hand!
* 1:56 - Same outfits as previous, looks like they're at some kind of event? Lots of lights in the background
* 1:57 - Miss Patty's ballet rehearsal, Fall
* 1:57 - Dean at Doose's, turns around surprised - Corn starch is on sale!
* 1:59 - Sookie making themed cakes and cupcakes - what is on that cake on the right? Little houses - Stars Hollow? There is a sun and what looks like a farm with chickens. Looks like Spring based on the flowers. There is also a lot of pink, and there is a completely golden cake behind her.
* 2:03 - Caesar taking the check from Luke, Luke sees someone being let out of a town car in front of his shop -- Emily? Logan? Christopher?
* 2:04 - Paris at Chilton
* 2:05 - Logan relaxed on a couch with a Surface Pro. Nice looking couch, 2 guitars in the background. Balcony outside?
* 2:06 - Lane playing drums, looks like with a band
* 2:07 - Pilgrim scene from I'm guessing the musical. Is that Sutton?
* 2:08 - Luke &amp; Lor kissing - Lor is in a hat, so winter or fall?
* 2:09 - Emily by water/garden, with Lemonade or a cocktail, looking suspiciously happy. Looks like setting up for an event.
* 2:10 - Lorelai in the middle of the ballerinas on a stage (the ones previously practicing) - Fall - looks like the same dress as the Truck and party clip.

I also think there's a possibility that they'll have a baby (as in that would be the something missing), but my money would be on a wedding. 
-I think that if any of the boys are a love interest for Rory it's Logan. I'm fairly confident he is a love interest. I don't know if they'll end up together, but because her relationship with Jess seems friendly and we know Logans in all the episodes but we didn't see a scene, I'm pretty confident they'll have some sort of romantic connection.

We know Gilmore Girls is no stranger to the dream sequence and I think it makes sense with how much these scenes seem to have a heightened sense of emotion, dreamy lighting, and they're wearing the same clothes.

Ep 12. Chris remarks that's good coffee and Lorelai tells him it's from Luke's and you can see Chris gently pushing the coffee away as if it's a motion sensitive bomb or a poisonous substance.It's extremely stupid and funny at the same time.

Ep 13. The scene at the hospital annoys me to no end. Chris wasn't even there for Lorelai but hey, I guess he didn't want anyone else to be there either? The nerve he had to be annoyed that Luke was there. Which reminds me why I prefer Luke over Chris. Yes, he handled the April situation poorly, he had some pretty horrible comebacks for Lorelai after the break-up but at the end of the day, no matter what has happened, you can count on Luke in a crisis which is more than you could ever say about Chris(although he did show up that one time when his kid broke an arm)

Ep 14. Which brings me to Lorelai's awesome line: ""You know what the worst part of it was? When you weren't there, part of me wasn't surprised."" Because despite going through some stretches of time where he sort of showed up, in the end, Chris is the same unreliable guy in S7 that he was back in S1(for Lorelai at least).

To his reply when being called out by Lorelai: ""That's not fair."" I quote S3 Lorelai: ""Yes, fair, the fairest, the Snow White of fair.""

Scott was dressed in a suit and tie, Sean was dressed in a white button down, much more put together than Kirk normally looks, and Milo was dressed in a green shirt with a chain hanging around his neck that went into his shirt. Because of the way Milo was dressed, I couldn't tell if what he was wearing were his normal clothes or if he just hadn't changed into his clothes for whatever scene they were shooting yet, but if it was Jess' outfit for the scene, it made me wonder whether that chain possibly had a ring on the end of it? Because I never really imagined Jess as a type of person who'd wear jewelry unless there was some kind of symbolism behind it, and him wearing his wedding ring on a chain instead of his hand would seem like something he would do (or something the creators would do so that Jess being married wouldn't wouldn't leak in any of the trailers/promotional material) ",7,1,False,self,,,,,

Sorry if other people have suggested any of these already; reading every comment on every thread is getting a little overwhelming lol.

First, and possibly the most unlikely, what if Lorelai and Luke had a kid (which would mean they've really kept it under wraps, especially in the trailer) and that ended up putting off a wedding? So now Lorelai is finding herself in another ""we're in love, we have a kid, we're not married"" situation and she feels incomplete because after all these years it's still not ""official."" 

Next, I think Rory visiting after a long period of time might make Lorelai a little nostalgic and makes her realize how much things have changed. And that's why things feel ""hazy."" I gather this from that clip of the Dragonfly in the trailer--it seems to be full of young people (and that guy doing crunches on a balance ball???). Kinda looks like the Inn has become a hangout place for hip, young people. Quite a switch from Norman Mailer. 

Finally, and I posted this in another thread, I think the show might do a memorial for Richard with flashbacks and a montage and they'll end it with a flashback to the funeral scene. So that would explain the casket clip, since we know he's already been gone a few months when the first episode starts.

That's all the insight I have based on the trailer, so let me know what you think! And feel free to share more guesses!",41,13,False,self,,,,,

Going off what we've seen from the trailer as far as production, sets, actors, extras, an assumed sizable crew, post-production, promotions, etc. I'm making a wild guess that Netflix gave the Palladinos a budget in upwards of $30-40 million. I have no basis for this guess, just going off that the studio was willing to pay Lauren and Alexis $6 million. Emily and Scott has to be making close or at least half of that. And also [speculation](http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/28/is-netflix-inc-spending-6-billion-on-original-cont.aspx) that Netflix is dedicating $1.3 billion on ALL their original content just in 2016 and the revival has to be one of the bigger projects for them this year.

My questions:

* Where does the WB come into this financially, if at all? Do they get a % of the revenue? Do they take on some of the budget burden or is it all on Netflix?
* How long do you think it'll take before Netflix recups that $30-40 million? As of 2015, Netflix has 75 million subscribers at $8-12 per, **I bet they break even before 2016 is over**. Also consider the amount of new subscribers they'll get just from the revival alone. (In a [letter](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NFLX/3111863543x0x912075/700E14FD-12BE-4C3A-9283-9A975C7FE549/FINAL_Q3_Letter.pdf) to their shareholders, Netflix revealed they  made over $2 billion last quarter).
* **Do you think a $30-40 million budget is low, too high or close?**


**Keep in mind I know absolutely squat about industry costs. But they  keep touting the revival as four ""mini-movies"" so $8-9 million per movie is not out of the realm of possibility?*


For some perspective, [this](https://www.onstride.co.uk/blog/much-cost-produce-favorite-tv-show/) is the per episode budget of some other popular shows:


* Sense8	Netflix	$9,000,000	
* Game of Thrones	HBO	$8,000,000	
* Once Upon a Time	ABC	$4,500,000

We also have a lot of promo photos of Emily looking Emily af, and I would assume the walkthrough at Emily's house where all of the furniture is still there.

So I'm wondering, what everyone thinks is going to be the timeline and the pacing of her story. Is it possible that Emily dumps all of her stuff in Summer or Fall and leaves her home to maybe spend time with her sister in Paris or to just enjoy the single life, or do we think she gets rid of her stuff and then buys a bunch of new stuff later?

And what do we think is going on in the happy shot outdoors? If it is a wedding, it definitely doesn't match the decor for the wedding props, so it'd be an additional wedding to the one we already know about. Did Emily finally decide to get a home in Martha's Vineyard?

And why is Rory wandering around her empty, but still furnished house? I think the only she'd be leaving the house to either of the girls is if she decided to refurnish it, which sounds a little manic for what I hope Emily would be doing.

TW: Sexual assault/rape",https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5a6nlr/do_you_think_jess_will_apologize_for_or_reference/,FunQuestion,1477843111,"As someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped (depending on the definition) I've always been on the fence about this scene. I think part of it is the fact that this happened in 2003, and having watched the episode in ""real time"" at the same age as Rory, I did not consider what took place in Kyle's bedroom to be attempted rape. Shitty for being aggressive, yes, but not ""attempted rape"" level of aggressive. Again, this is how I viewed the situation in 2003 at 18.

My understanding of consent expanded over the next few years. Hell, even when I had something much worse than ""the Kyle bedroom scene"" happen to me in 2006, it took me a few years to even realize or understand that because I had been drinking and was wavering in and out of consciousness, that I hadn't actually consented to what took place. It wasn't even denial - intelligent, progressive female friends I discussed it with at the time were similarly on the fence about whether what happened to me was sexual assault or rape. However, if it happened today, it would have been completely cut and dry because of the more heightened awareness of consent and (albeit slow) changes to rape culture. About two years ago, the person who assaulted me actually messaged me on FB to apologize as they too had realized it was assault, 8 years after the incident had taken place.

I think when a lot of people watch the series for the first time today, or even as recently as a few years ago, they don't realize how far we've actually come, thanks in a huge part to the internet/social media in expanding our understanding of consent, even among the average liberal progressive woman who identifies as a feminist. I can completely understand why Rory would still treat Jess as a friend or even a love interest after this scene - because I, as a college-bound burgeoning feminist in 2003 had the same experiences and interpreted the situation through what I understood at the time about rape/consent.

I'm honestly curious if ASP will have Jess will apologize or acknowledge the incident in some way given how much attention has been given to it in recent years compared to when the show was still filming. It seems like something that the fandom, now adult and far more knowledgeable would want to see but I'm not sure if it's something ASP would be willing to tackle or if it could be done in a way where it could fit into the story.",48,5,False,self,,,,,

However, I haven't actually seen the show through consecutively for a while now (I usually just rewatch my favourite episodes) so I thought I'd give it a go before the revival. I decided to try and forget my old biases and be as open minded as possible (we will see how well that works out). More importantly, I tried to watch out for the little things that I hadn't really noticed before. So here goes Season 1.

- This season is so cosy. It's definitely the most magical, with the golden lighting they use and even the drama is small potatoes and I love that. 

- Even though Lorelai is shown to be a bit of an immature at times, I feel like she somehow exhibits a lot more mature behaviour than in later seasons. She admits when she's wrong quite a bit, surprisingly! The 'cool mom' thing is also done very well and not too embarrassingly, probably because Rory's so young. 

- Rory is awesome. She's tough, she's sweet, she's flawed, she's a hard worker, she's a little bratty but only in the normal teen way, she's nice to people who don't really deserve it. Yay Season 1 Rory.

- They play up Luke and Lorelai's sexual tension SO MUCH the first half of the season. They have great chemistry. They settle it down a lot more the latter half, though.

- Rory can actually hug in this season. In some of the first few episodes she does some proper, bear hug, full-frontal hugs. I don't know what happened later. 

- I love that they make Lorelai and Rachel friendly instead of rivals. Rachel is lovely and definitely the best of Luke's exes. 

- Dean's pop culture 'thing' is movies. I don't think the dumbing down is not as drastic as others think it is. He references movies a lot, but doesn't actually seem to be a reader. He doesn't like or understand Tolstoy, and when Rory asks if he likes Jane Austen he says 'I'd tell you but then I'd have to kill you.' Rory seems to think that means he liked it, but to me that means he didn't but didn't have the heart to tell Rory. 

- Dean and Rory's relationship time frame is all over the place. Dean says that he counts their 3 month anniversary from her birthday, which we know is in October meaning the firelight festival would be January or possibly Feb. Lane mentions in the penultimate episode that Rory's been grumpy for five weeks since the breakup, however the very next episode is the end of the school year, which I think in the USA is May? So either many weeks passed between the penultimate and final episode or the timeline went wrong somewhere. 

- Lane is kinda annoying at the start? Especially in Love, War and Snow. She's such a sad sack. But she starts getting to be witty, cool Lane by the end. 

- Random Townies like Joe and the Mayor make appearances and then fade or disappear altogether later on. 

- Max is sort of dreamy and I think he and Lorelai do have good chemistry. Looks wise they fit great together too. He fits in very well with the town when we see him in the town meeting. There are little bits where he's nodding and shaking his head and heckling which I thought were nice touches on Scott Cohen's part. However, proposing when they've only been back together for a few weeks is CRAZY.

- We are told on 2 separate occasions Dean calls 5-7 times a night. It's played as cute, but we know later when Rory's going off him it's played as annoying. Nice continuation though, as it's established that is a characteristic of Dean. 

- Emily and Richard are shown quite fairly I think. We see Emily as a villain sometime through Lorelai's eyes, but it's often tempered with us as an audience seeing her reaction by herself, or seeing her talking to Richard. The show definitely shows both sides to the arguments. 

- Madeline and Louise actually have separate, distinguishable personalities compared to Colin and Finn or Lucy and Olivia. 

- Paris shows glimpses of humour, but is mostly played rather seriously and her rants are scary rather than funny. 

- Rory and Dean are cute but don't have tons of chemistry. They are a little blah on screen (this opinion hasn't changed since I first watched it years ago). Rory's Dance is my favourite episode for them. But I also think the first kiss is fantastic too. 

- Tristan isn't as much like Logan as I remembered. I think they have too much in common for me not to raise my eyebrows, but Logan is light and easy charm, whereas Tristan is a little more somber and sensitive (when he's not being a jerk). 

- Kirk is awkward but not as insane as he is later. 

I have loads more observations but it's already a long thread as is! All in all, Season 1 is cosy and magical but still has some teething problems. ",9,14,False,self,,,,,

Do you hope they are addressed in the revival? Did you have one that has already been ruined?

A head cannon, according to urban dictionary, ""Used by followers of various media of entertainment, such as television shows, movies, books, etc. to note a particular belief which has not been used in the universe of whatever program or story they follow, but seems to make sense to that particular individual, and as such is adopted as a sort of ""personal canon"". Headcanon may be upgraded to canon if it is incorporated into the program or story's universe.""

I'll start- 

""Taylor keeps Stars Hallow small""- this one is about how stars hallow keeps small business booming, and why there can still be a walmart nearby... Taylor's Dose Market, just one of his business's, has been offered to be bought out by IGA, and other market lines, Aldi's etc., but he has always refused. He has it made, owns the building, has a personal produce guy, probably has other direct distributors, and gets amazing deals. He makes a large profit for such a small store. He also has managed to maintain control over NEW business. This would explain how stars hallow can manage to have such a small market, and other specialty stores. If taylor says no to all chain stores, Stars hallow maintains its quaintness, and theres no monopoly. People still shop at walmart, but not in town. That alone would keep vistors coming in, just to see a story book town. 


""Lane's Dad""- the Kims own another business. that is why Mr Kim is never seen. He is always there, and just lets Mrs Kim run the antique shop, which is like their ""fluff"" business. (that pisses miss kim off)

He's just so temperamental! He freaks out over every little thing and blows up at Rory all the time.  Like that one time she wasn't wearing the bracelet he made for her, he acted like she committed a crime.  If my boyfriend ever acted like that I'd dump him. And he's either needy or insecure or something because if Rory even casually encounters Jess he freaks out.  I just hate guys like that, he's so jealous and always yells at Rory, but hey pal you don't own her and she's allowed to talk to other guys. I get that he's threatened by Jess but if he was more comfortable in his skin and comfortable in their relationship he wouldn't let Jess get to him.  I think Rory's totally out of his league and he knows it but he won't accept it which is quite selfish because he's totally holding her back.  And lets not forget the time he freaked out simply because Tristan was holding Rory's books I believe he said something like ""Rory what the hell is this"".... just because a guy was HOLDING HER BOOKS AT SCHOOL.. what the heck, since when does that mean you're in a relationship?  It also always bothered me that he always felt like he was entitled to have Rory, like if he really loved her he would let her go knowing that she deserves better and has bigger plans than he can keep up with.  Like when they broke up at that party Rory's grandparents threw for her in a later season, he totally made the breakup ugly and played the victim, he could never just accept that she was out of his league and let her go nicely, without making her feel guilty for the life she lives.  She never made him feel bad for his lifestyle.  He just always acted like he was entitled to a better life but he never actually made the choices to get there.  Like when he cheated on his wife and ruined their marriage he had to move in with his parents and he was such a baby about it, he should have been thankful they took him in, not whiny.  He's the one who got himself into that situation!  I just really don't like needy, insecure, whiny, entitled people and unfortunately he fits the bill.  I don't want to offend any Dean fans but I just personally don't like him at all.. I really wish I did though!  Are the fans supposed to like him? Because personally I just don't see how, they did not write him to be an easily likable guy...",11,5,False,self,,,,,
