When I was 12-15 I saw so many episodes of Gilmore Girls on TV after dinner. The show always struck a chord and I shamelessly watched it (although I never admitted this, being a guy).

A few days ago I finally started with everything. Luckily enough I don't know anything about the finale, or probably even the final season. This is *almost* going in blind! 

Not going to return here until all episodes are watched. It makes me happy there's a sub for this though. Bye!",14,45,False,self,,,,,

All this seems pretty obvious to me but it wasn't mentioned at all in season 7 and on the GG message board that I skimmed through, no one seem to have mentioned it. 

So did the season 7 writers decide to drop it or did I read those scenes wrong?",5,10,False,self,,,,,
