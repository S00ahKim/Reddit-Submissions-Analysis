Cut to Season 5 Luke finds out Lorelai had a lunch with Christopher.  It doesn't even occur to Lorelai to mention it until Rory presses her on it.  Luke finds out and gets pretty upset about it, even though he pretends to be cool.  Seems like Lorelai really doesn't think that having lunch with an ex is a big deal",6,8,False,self,,,,,

I thought the 'cute' or 'romantic' things that he did, like repeatedly calling (even when he knew she wasn't home), or going to her play rehearsals even when she asked him not to, were all kind of controlling. But it's a TV show, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. However, now I'm doing a rewatch and am on Lost &amp; Found, the episode where Dean notices that Rory's not wearing his bracelet, and he gets *mad*. He's really upset that she's not wearing it, and she feels like she has to lie and say she's getting over a rash, instead of just telling him the truth, that she misplaced it. And then she's frantic for the rest of the episode looking for it, because if he found out she lost it, he'd freak out.

I've seen this behavior before, in friends who were with controlling, even abusive, partners; they were so afraid to make a tiny slip up, because they knew that their partner wouldn't just say 'Oh, it sucks you lost it' or even take 'I didn't feel like wearing it today' as a valid reason not to have it on. I'm not saying that the writers intended for Dean to come across as abusive, but the fact that Rory's afraid to tell him the truth about an innocent issue, and the fact that this isn't the first time that this has happened, makes me want to kick him to the curb. This relationship got so toxic so early on.

It also makes me want to shake Lorelai, and ask her why she's letting her daughter run around afraid that her boyfriend will be mad at her, rather than tell her daughter that if you're afraid that an innocent mistake might make your boyfriend so angry with you that there will be a blow out fight, it's time to reconsider the relationship.",139,254,False,self,,,,,

Richard had been meeting with Pennilyn Lott on and off since they had both left Yale. I think there's more to it.

Pennilyn and Richard broke up and ended their engagement when Richard and Emily started to see each other.
What we don't know is that Pennilyn Lott left the school shortly after she and Richard broke up.

She left the school when it became too hard to conceal the fact that she was pregnant with his child.

Pennilyn gave the the baby up for adoption though, it was hard but she was able to focus on her school and she was successful lawyer who became a partner in a prestigious firm.

Fast forward some 20 years, their child has decided to search for their biological family.
They contact the agency they were adopted from and make contact with Pennilyn Lott.

And this is why Richard and Pennilyn have been meeting over the years.

I hope that even though this was something that Richard took to his grave that they can connect with their half sister Lorelai and their niece Rory",2,19,False,self,,,,,

Although I have previously watched this episode many times, viewing it without sound gave an entirely different perspective. 
In this particular scene, there is a man and a woman (Lorelai and Luke) who were previously in a serious relationship but are no longer together. They live in a very small town and have run into each other at the supermarket for the first time since separating. Lorelai is in the frozen food aisle, grabbing an item from the freezer and when she closes the door, Luke is staring at her, a few feet away. They both keep their proximal distance and their faces mutually display an attempt at masking but given the context and circumstances, their faces give away more emotion than they may be aware. This assuredly conveys the concept of facial management technique. Slowly, they both decrease their distance from one another, but maintain a safe distance. While they, typically, have very wordy/extensive conversations, in this scene, their lips are moving notably slower. In particular, Lukes facial expression moves to demonstrate neutralization and he appears to be of the withholder style. This is presumably to make Lorelai believe that he was completely okay with their breakup. Conversely, Lorelais facial expression has moved from the role of masking to the unwitting expressor. This is truly a consistent aspect of Lorelais personality given the fact that in other episodes of the series, she expresses emotions that are inappropriate for the situation. As well, both Luke and Lorelais body language are consistent with their facial expression",6,3,False,self,,,,,

So I have no clue if this has been brought up before. Im doing a rewatch and just saw s6 ep20 super cool party people. Its the episode where Luke throws April a birthday party and Lorelai ends up helping. Id like to mention I dont hate the April plot line. Though this rant may seem like I dont like it. Apologies for the length. 

It bothers me that Anna got so mad Lorelai was there. I do think that Anna has the right to be mad but not to the extent that she was. Yes she should have met Lorelai before April did. She should have set those ground rules with Luke from the get go. Not after the fact. Shes had the kid for 12 years so she knows what shes doing and how she wants things done. Luke doesnt. Im assuming she knew about Lorelai and that she existed even though when she was yelling at Luke she was calling her his girlfriend and not fianc. 

I also dont know why she throws out that shes not ok with Lorelai being there when I think its kinda more appropriate that she is. This is probably going to come off as offensive to someone but Luke is new to Aprils life and Anna hasnt known him for the past 12 years. I mean I could be wrong but didnt he get arrested or something when he found out Nicole was cheating and he beat up that car? Again no offense but she knew Luke 12 years ago she barely knows him now whos to say its appropriate to leave all the girls alone with him? No she doesnt know Lorelai but as one of the parents of the other girls maybe they wouldve felt more comfortable with her there. 

Even after Lorelai apologizes and explains herself Anna basically says its my way or the highway. It bothers me that Anna losing it on Luke is the catalyst for the end of Luke and Lorelais relationship. At least in my opinion. Had she been ok with Lorelai being involved with April they probably wouldve gotten married just fine. Lorelai knew April wasnt going to be out of the picture for Luke and Anna wasnt comfortable with Lorelai. That leads Lorelai to believe shes the one to go.

There are four levels:

1- Basic (this is 5 multiple choice questions, 1 point each)

2- Simple (this is 5 short answer questions, 2 points each)

3- Specific (this is 4 short answer questions, 3 points each, and they're about specific episodes/moments/lines)

4-Oh Shit (this is 1-3 REALLY hard short answer questions. Almost no one got these last time, that's kinda the point).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm keeping it mostly short answer because I think that GG is so specific with their references that everyone can remember the answer given the choices and it's supposed to be a little hard ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**None of this is going to include AYITL**

&amp;#x200B;

Also, **PLEASE NOTE**, I am the only one doing this. I have to type in every single variance of a response. Example:

Question: What is the name of the show?

Answers I have to enter so that Google doesn't mark a correct answer wrong: Gilmore Girls, Gilmore girls, gilmore girls, gilmore Girls.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if your spelling is off, it will be marked as incorrect**. I can't account for all possible spelling errors because I have a full course load. Names are always capitalized. Lorelai is not spelled Lorelei, at least for my quizzes. Numbers are always '8' not 'eight', but I will try to remember to add the spelled out version as well.

**My favorite poll answers:** What are the best parts of Rory's worst boyfriend?

&amp;#x200B;

*Dean*\-

was better when he was younger - well read and supportive -( u/LetshearitforNY)

How he was always willing to change the water cooler -( u/summer_berry)

Dean - he is a great first boyfriend -( u/AWhovianPotterhead)

In my opinion, Dean is the worst. His redeeming quality is that he treated her well at the beginning of their relationship. You could tell he truly loved and cared about her. -( u/anisorusrex)

&amp;#x200B;

*Jess-*

he grew somewhat and recognized how much Luke positively influenced his life -( u/KweenindaNorf_7777)

he's resilient. Despite his troubled upbringing, he doesn't turn to drugs and his crimes (stealing balls and kicking gnomes) are more funny than mean. He skips school but later makes something out of his life and pursues his passion -( u/Mohnblume444)

Jess was a good kisser -( u/CarmeIIasoprano)

Jess: literary, cared about her, clever, funny -( u/happystar4321)

Jess was her worst boyfriend, but he had the most character growth in the entire show. He was highly intelligent, learned from his mistakes, and at a young age was willing to be better. Jess is a self-made success, and most people think that he's now too good for Rory. He's also funny, and a hard worker. -( u/sheherselfandher)

Jess was her equal intelligently -( u/BernieRoundbottom)

&amp;#x200B;

Logan-

Logan - Spontaneous, attentive -( u/Thatsnice22)

Logan: He was well-mannered generous, and easygoing. -( u/snailslimeandbeespit)

Logan pushed Rory out of her comfort zone. -( u/BertieWoostersAunt)

Logan is actually very caring and understanding at times -( u/intergalacticnarc_)

&amp;#x200B;

***I think it's nice to remember each of the characters are fantastically imperfect people. This was an attempt at showing that we can find good things in the well-written characters. To those of you who were oh-so-funny by answering ""nothing"", thanks.***

Hello! This morning I'm excited to announce a new project. It's not another cookbook. It's a film. A documentary, actually, based on Gilmore Girls:

Daisies &amp; Dragonflies: a Documentary Look Inside the Hollow

Late last year my husband, Tim, and I were having breakfast at our local diner. We were discussing possible goals &amp; projects for the new year, when one of us said ""why hasn't anyone made a documentary about Gilmore Girls?"". So we researched what it would take for us to make one ourselves. Several months later, we were filming our first interview - with Rini Bell, who played ""Lulu"" on the show. From there, we were on our way!

All summer we've been interviewing folks who worked on the show - cast members, crew members, writers. Even though I've been an avid fan of this show all along, and tend to read, watch, and listen to everything that comes out about it, when I sit in these interviews, I keep having ""A-HA"" moments. Moments when the person we're interviewing tells us some completely new information, or makes use think about something in a completely different way. It's been mind-blowing!

We are still interviewing now, most likely through the end of the year. We've talked with 20 people so far and we intend to double that number before we're finished.

Tim and I have funded this entire project so far, and we're going to continue funding the interviews. The next phase is the post production phase - the time when the film gets edited, the sound gets mixed, the score, the music and all of the on-screen titles are added, and the whole thing gets color-corrected. 

We're not skilled to do all of that by ourselves! So we've lined up a talented, experienced group of industry pros - people who work on major projects you've definitely heard of before. As you can probably imagine, this part of the project has a steep price tag!

So, we've decided to return to Kickstarter to fund the post production phase. I'm actually really excited about this. Based on my experiences with the cookbooks, bringing a project to Kickstarter turns it from a Tim &amp; Kristi thing into a Community thing. Having a supportive group of people around a project, involved in a project adds so much warmth and so much magic. The difference is tangible!

If you're excited about this, if you'd like to see this project turn into a feature-length documentary, and if you'd like to help move that process along, then I invite you to visit our Kickstarter page, to learn more about it, to see me dressed up in silly costumes again, and to become part of the community around this project. The campaign is brand new - just launched this morning! The rewards are pretty fun - lots of Gilmore-inspired items in there. Plus there's an Early Bird offering available today and tomorrow - it expires Tue at 11:59pm.

2. Had a baby girl as a teenager (mom-19, Lorelai-16)
3. Had an absent baby's dad (parents married, dad was away at college then divorced)
4. Had to ask grandparents for money for their kid's school (mom- paternal grandparents, Lorelai- maternal)
5. Daughter with above-average reading levels (Me- solidly reading by 3.5 &amp; avid reader, Rory- I mean, come on.)
6. More fun-loving than their daughter
7. She became a maid at an inn &amp; is working her way up
8. No baby pictures, but she had a big head
9. Needs glasses, barely wears them
10. Raised protestant, only a holiday Christian
11. Similar physical traits (dark hair, blue eyes, pale skin)
12. Will kill you for a cup of coffee
13. Makes coffee 2-3x stronger than the package says
14. Doesn't introduce her kids to a relationship until it is VERY longterm
15. Definitely not physically gifted/sporty
16. Music tastes
17. Movie-savvy
18. Goes out of her way to help her friends/neighbors 
19. Discussion &gt; punishments
20. Encouraging their daughter to be more outgoing
21. Borrowing clothes from their daughter
22. They get jealous of other people getting close to their daughter &amp; lash out, but then apologize
23. Probably more

I've spend more than a year reading (and re-reading) Gilmore Girls fan fiction and I kind of need a break with a real book. Preferably written post-1990 with a 3.70 or more on Goodreads. Any other Gilmore Girl similarities are additional pluses. For the record, I have already looked at [this list](https://www.bustle.com/p/if-luke-lorelai-on-gilmore-girls-are-your-otp-you-need-to-pick-up-these-11-books-16974921) from Bustle. I'm not looking for YA, which rules a lot of these out. I did read *Magnolia Inn*, which is not YA, but the writing style is overly repetitious and drives me insane with how frequently characters have the same internal monologues. Similarly, *The Simplicity of Cider* and *Flamingo Diner* were not for me either and I couldn't get through them.

I've also found other book list recommendations in my search as reference for other people looking for books, though none of the books I read really had the Luke/Lorelai ""vibe"" I was looking for.:

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear that Rory has some kind of crazy crush on Jess, which is definitely reciprocated. You don't see Jess really thrown off his game until later in the episode when Rory finds out Luke didn't do the food, but the end of 'There's the Rub', where the deleted scene is from. 

Paris not only calls out Rory's feelings (which she desperately wants to ignore), but she validates them and doesn't question them. Lorelai, Rory's **best friend**, questions her feelings and invalidates them by saying that Jess is trouble and that he's only a phase Rory is going through. Paris says that she gets it, that she wouldn't blame her, and then doesn't judge her for not wanting to talk about it anyway. 

Up until this point, there's (almost?) no scenes of Paris just *really* getting it. Sure, they bond over the Bangles, but then Paris gets mad at Rory because Tristin tells her that they're going on a date, proceeding to hold that grudge for far too long (something that proves a low emotional intelligence for the sake of plot/comedy). But here, where there's no reason for comedy to be in the scene, she just offers an ear. 

Paris spends so much time with her parents b\*tching about each other. She crunches. the. numbers. of. her. parents'. divorce. with her father, only complaining that it was a waste of time because he realized it would be too expensive to go through with the divorce. She's constantly neglected and ignored by her parents, but she doesn't ignore them. She probably sees everything around her and because she doesn't know how to reach out, she doesn't. 

PARIS IS SUCH A GOOD FRIEND AND I WANT TO CRY.

&gt;Rory: Samosa?  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: \[*takes the food, sets it aside*\] Okay, I'm stuffed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: I know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: I ate four meals in two hours  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: Not a record, but respectable nonetheless... Anything in particular you want to watch?  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: I don't care. I don't usually watch TV, so anything's fine with me.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[*Rory switches channels\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: That looks good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: Ah ah ah- Never settle on the first show, it makes you look desperate. \[*continues flipping channels*\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: He likes you, you know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: Well, we've been going out for a year. I guess I've grown on him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Not Dean, Jess.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: \[*surprised*\] What?  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Must be nice, having two guys fawning over you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: \[*miffed*\] I do not have two guys fawning over me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Fine, two guys like you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: I do not have two guys liking me. I have one guy liking me. The other guy is just a friend- not even a friend, he's just here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Well, I wouldn't mind having a here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: \[*insistent*\] Well, then you would have nothing because that's all it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Okay. \[*seemingly having moved on, watching TV*\] Why are you watching girls jumping on trampolines?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: \[*decidedly not having moved on, she sits up*\] I mean, why would you even say that he likes me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: I don't know, he brought over enough food to feed Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: That was Luke, not Jess.   
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Well, he certainly didn't mind staying around to help you eat it.   
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: That's just Jess. He plays games; he likes to annoy me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Oh. \[*pause*\] Did he?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: Of course. Majorly. I'm still bugged.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Hmm. Weird.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: What's weird?  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Well, I don't usually invite people who annoy me to stay for dinner.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: I didn't invite him, he just wouldn't leave.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: You could have gotten rid of him if you really wanted to.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: I was just trying to be nice. \[*You can* ***see*** *Paris's AHA! moment*\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: I think you like him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: That's crazy! I mean, just because you don't kick someone out for dinner, that doesn't mean that you like them. Jeez. \[*She seems pissy*\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Paris: Okay. \[*pause*\] But if you ever decide you do like him, I wouldn't blame you. He's unbelievably cute. And though his  literary taste leaves a little to be desired, at least he has literary taste... You sure you don't like him?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rory: \[*Clearly uncomfortable*\] I have a boyfriend.

On the other, it seems like the type of thing that would annoy Emily &amp; Richard - wasting time and money on silly parties and ridiculous stunts - which would make it appealing to her.

I dont own my condo, I rent from
my mother, but she said I may choose any color I wish as long as its nothing *too* bright (which is fine by me) because she will be selling the place in about two years when her and my step-dad retire. 
     Anyway, I am just overwhelmed by the choices! Now know how Lorelai felt in S6e8 when she was trying to decide what color to have the walls painted after she and Luke remodeled her house! All the swatches!!! Its no wonder she asked Paul to pick.  
    In that episode though it always struck me as just being so very *Lorelai* that she had such indecision over the paint colors. When Lukes diner needed a spruce back in an earlier season she wasted noooo time telling him what colors she thought were best. And when she got the swatches for the house she ended up choosing/recommending colors to everyone in town for their homes &amp; businesses. 
     Suddenly, I am doing the very same thing- Ive picked out colors for my future kitchen, living room, bathroom, suggested colors for a friends new place, given my two cents on what we should paint old rooms at my nanas house that were selling... But I cant seem to decide on my own room! 
   So now, with no Paul Anka to lick the dark magenta swatch for me, I am faced with two options: take the Lorelai route and ask my cat to pick one with his paw, or make a pro/con list  l Rory.

I guess growing up, I was more into Veronica Mars, America's Next Top Model (The early seasons), and never really found my way into Gilmore world. It'd come on T.V., and I'd find it really boring and couldn't be bothered. But now, I absolutely love it. The drama is very real and the characters are very developed for the most part, and it makes you both root and hate your favorites.

Season 4 - Season 5 is where I'm currently at the beginning of Season 5. Some opinions I have so far as a first time watcher:

&amp;#x200B;

Jess was completely in the wrong for coming back, telling Rory he loved her after he ditched her and didn't call back, his communication skills would've eventually drove Rory off the wall and she'd find someone else, because let's face it, Milo does a great job acting as him enough to make me hate his character. I hate how his character felt so entitled after coming back thinking Rory would ust fawn back and drop everything in her life for him, and I was really bugged by Lane who seemed all for it, despite how unrealistic it was. Rory so far has cheated on every boyfriend, Dean with Jess, and Jess with Dean. Frankly I'm fond of neither Dean or Jess. I like Dean better as a person, but the writers did both him and Luke injustices by making them stupid later on, when Dean and Rory going out was partly because of their chemistry, it would've just been better for the writers to write out Rory losing interest. I wish Lindsay would have  a more productive story arc rather then just being someone's wife. But I suppose thats a parallel contrast to what people felt Emily was to Richard. 

I really REALLY dislike Richard. He's one of those classic old dudes that can't take anyone that has anything against what they have to say. They refuse to see anything in a different perspective and always think they're in the right, no matter what the conversation or the situation, and if anything shouldn't go the way they approve, they turn their heads and walk out the room and the situation is never actually resolved, it just forces a new situation in which causes the previous conversation to be placed under the rug and never spoken about again, WHICH I REALLY DISLIKE. I can see why Rory and Lorelai have such awful communication. Love Emily, but she has the same problems in communication, but her actress plays Emily so well you can really see all the faults and why she is how she is. I hate how Richard never really stood up for Emily against Trix other then when defending her after Emily said he wouldn't be where he was unless it was for her.

Side note: they both do the same thing to each other.

I also really appreciate how the writers progress the plot and keep things moving and not in a ""Will they won't they"" type of string some shows do for SEASONS BEYOND SEASONS without any real satisfactory output until the finale. 

I ALSO HATE, how Lorelai supports Rory eating so much crappy food. That honestly can't be good for them, and shes lucky she has a fast metabolism to drain all that crap otherwise it wouldn't be good later on life. I just wish she'd have supported more healthier eating habits for her own child. 

&amp;#x200B;

And final opinion: Taylor is my least favorite character and I hate how his character never really sees karma for his shitty actions and selfish moments.",17,13,False,self,,,,,

Why is it, then, that Richard and Emily *never* used their connections to The Newspaper Guy^(TM) to benefit Rory in pursuit of her journalism career? Once Rory was at Chilton and clearly on the path to the Ivy Leagues, I'm surprised they wouldn't have put in a favor with their pal Mitchum (before Rory met/dated Logan). With a properly placed phone call and a mailed/faxed/emailed sample of Rory's writing, Mitchum could have really set her up on the path to success. Rory could have had summer jobs or internships, and god knows what else well-connected people might get. 

I don't know, this has always really bothered me! Not using your connections to your advantage is very un-Gilmore!",17,15,False,self,,,,,

She's quiet, smart, and nice but shy. As the series progresses and she gets more and more involved in the ""Gilmore world"" and the high society crowd we see Rory change, or maybe just mature, into a girl who makes more reckless and self involved decisions. Slowly she veers away from the clean image she had before. Even her relationship with Lorelai, while still incredibly special and close, changes and has more friction and more distance. Then we see her again in the revival, and knowing ASP's intentions, know she was always going to end up unexpectedly pregnant just like Lorelai.

There were always high expectations put on Rory, I think, to go to a top school and become a successful journalist/foreign correspondent. And she didn't live up to those expectations. She ends up back in Stars Hollow, at the age of 32, unexpectedly pregnant. And had things gone ASP's way she would've ended up, probably back in Stars Hollow, at 22 freshly graduated from Yale...still unexpectedly pregnant. Except now she's unexpectedly pregnant with her engaged ex-boyfriends baby (an ex who, a decade prior, had proposed to her).

She's repeating, in a sense, Lorelai's life. Don't get me wrong, Lorelai's life and Lorelai's story is amazing. But that's not the life that was envisioned for Rory.

1. Season 2
2. Season 5
3. Season 1
4. Season 3
5. Season 4
6. Season 7
7. Season 6

1. **season 2** The reason that season 2 is all the way at the beginning is because i *loved* season 2. Its such a pure season and i think it embodies gilmore girls as a whole. It is such a beautiful season and i think its so important. Everything that happens in it makes me so happy and i love the low quality and homey feeling. 

2. **Season 5** This is by far the most addicting season. Every time i watch season 5, its really hard to stop. On my first watch, i finished it in 3 days. For two of those days i was watching 9 episodes a day. It gave us so much closure (Luke and lorelai) and its also such an action filled season. So much happens and every single episode has something important. In my opinion it was made perfectly.

3. **season 1** a classic season. Its my favorite because i love seeing all the characters so young and i love seeing the dragon fly inn. The show has come so far since season 1, its beautiful to see. And i love how we learn all of the characters little quirks and things- season 1 rory is a gem. She was so nice and cute. 

4. **season 3** i think season 3 is the last season we really see rory be her young innocent self, and seeing her character be shaped was both fun and also infuriating. I think seeing lorelai and Lukes character development were interesting too, because Lukes character development was sort of non existent before this. Such an important season, its where we meet Gigi and jess too. I dont know its just great.

5. **season 4** on my rewatches, i think this is where i start dreading the show. I liked season 4, but i feel almost like it becomes an entirely new show. Rory moving to Yale and the new inn opening was just so big and changed a big part of the atmosphere for the show, but i love it because its beautiful in contrast to the later seasons.

6. **Season 7** is all the way down here because it was a fucking mess. All this season did was make me sad and the only reason its not all the way down is because season 6 was way worse in contrast and because while i hated season 7, it provided closure and somehow reminded me of earlier seasons. 

7. Season 6. Literally fuck season 6. All the plot lines were unnecessary. I hated april, i hated anna, and i hated the way luke and Logan and rory acted. The only saving grace in this entire season was jess. I could go on for hours about this season because i hate this season but Im not to save anyone the reading.

I like the friendships Lane has with the band, but it would have been so cool to see Lane with a friend who would challenge her to expand her horizons and do new things. 

Jess could have been that friend, at the very least in the revival!! They both love music and pop culture and are extremely  passionate people. They both are really funny and love banter. Plus, they both have tension associated with their upbringings and are really creative.

A Jess and Lane friendship would have created a creative music/literary powerhouse.

*Lorelai's spunky personality has always been part of the charm of GG, but some of her quirks start to get old, especially when she fires her pop up staff because he moved her coffee maker. You have a business to run lady, I literally don't think that's how anyone runs a business.

*Why did Lorelai have to pick at her mom over the giant portrait of her dad? Who cares if it's huge, her mom recently lost her husband, why does she always to to start fights with her mom?

*Richard's funeral: what in tarnation was up with her Lorelai's best memory story she spoke about ? Damn lady.

1. Rory always knew Marty liked her, and she knew she hurts him, but still pushed him to hang out with her (""Pleeease"")
2. Rory knew Logan is coming back on Saturday and invited Marty on purpose, hoping Logan would show up and see them together. Maybe to get some jealousy from Logan's part as at that point I think Rory liked him much more that he liked Rory

So all above doesn't make her a horrible person, and I think if Alexis would show it with her acting (not necessary showing she is horrible to Marty, but at least showing that Rory understands what she is doing), Rory would be much more likeable and  relatable. Instead she played naive and ""innocent"" Rory, who just wasn't believable.

Lorelai always drives home after the Friday Night dinners, and they often have at least two drinks in addition to wine served with the food... the worst example is when Lorelai goes to hang out with Cristopher after his father died (and lied about it to Luke - a horrible thing to do, it was an innocent thing, but when you lie about it he gets ideas) and drank a shitload of tequila.

She was really hungover the next day and told Rory she hadnt planned on staying so late. I assume therefore that she drove home after staying there and slept at home before getting up for breakfast with Rory. 

I find it odd this was a thing they did as f ex Lorelai wanted Rory to be a responsible adult. Plus, drunk driving not only affects you but you can hit someone and potentially kill them, so I have a problem with this.

My parents dont drive even after having just one beer. (I have done that a couple of times but would never drive after two.) I dont know if its less frowned upon/more lax in the US.

Lorelai was a social, smart, and sweet teenager. In flashbacks and lorelais story telling, we hear about her being a full of life teenager. And Emily *still* found ways to criticize her and berate her.

The second lorelai wouldnt fit into her dress, Emily told her to put on sweats and run around the block. Lorelai was skinny too, and couldve easily developed an eating disorder. 

Lorelai lived in a huge house, with maids and a cook, and possibly even her own driver, and the second lorelai gave birth, she couldve stayed and had 24/7 support for rory, but instead she left. Her parents emotionally abused her so much to the point where she still left. 

Yes Emily has some amazing moments and i love her. But her and Richard treated lorelai like fucking garbage. Is this sub just going to ignore when Emily broke lorelai and Luke up? Really?

I put mrs Kim in the title because Mrs Kim wasnt a great mom either. She kicked Lane out of the house just because lane wanted to play in a band. She was immensely controlling and until season 5/6, she was an awful mother towards lane.

Granted, you could say that it's easier to pick apart the people we spend more time with.

I found Lorelai and Rory to be worse than I ever remember them being in AYITL (I know I'm not the only one and it probably needs no further explanation) 

I forgive a few things from Rory's original run because she was so young and learning from her mistakes (Yeah, she strung along Dean when she liked Jess, but honestly I was a flighty young girl once and have been in situations like that). The whole sleeping with a married Dean was pretty bad too but I remember Rory feeling pretty bad about it and I thought she had learned from it (AYITL proves, she did not.)

Lorelai's immaturity can get annoying sometimes and in AYITL she especially drove me crazy when she had to pick on her mom regarding Richard's large portrait , her moment at his funeral, and the immature way she was running her business (firing celebrities chefs for trivial reasons)

Ultimately I have to say I feel that Lorelai is the lesser of 2 evils. I will always admire how she was able to make it as a single mother and raised a smart kid and was able to put herself through school and be a business owner. I know she did get help from her parents at times but as far as I know she didnt do that until Rory was 15/16 and got into Chilton. I can respect that she asked for the money to help better her child's future. Lorelai seems more down to earth and could always call Rory out on her shit (dropping out of yale, sleeping with a married Dean)

Like I said before, a lot of what Rory did in the original was ridiculous, but I was really hoping she would have grown up by 32. I know no one is perfect, and I think it's perfectly fine that Rory's career isn't where she wants it (32 is still young and that's life sometimes ) but my main argument with Rory is that she just doesn't seem like a good person, even years later. Strings along Paul. Cheats on Paul. Cheats with an engaged Logan. Keeps her crap at multiple people's house.  The entire mess with her career and acting like she's above being a teacher at Chilton and working for SandeeSays.

This, to me, was the most ridiculous part of the revival.

To be fair, the presence of other women in parallel positions to Lorelai, going through a crisis and seeking an extraordinary experience to discover something within themselves, counterbalanced the silliness of her ""doing Wild"" on the individual level, as the character the audience knows intimately. I think it's a situation a lot of people can relate to, and I do at least appreciate how this storyline shows the power of nature to lead us to self-discovery, deep contemplation, and transformation.

I could get into the tiny moments of her sitting in her motel room getting ready to hit the trail that just made my right eye twitch, but all in all, in a way I feel like this episode validated going on a spontaneous big wilderness adventure as a constructive outlet, when in reality it's extremely dangerous. In all seriousness, more and more people are doing exactly what Lorelai tried to do these days, not to mention the LNT impacts that uninformed hikers are having on our public lands.

Despite all of this, Lorelai's moment of contemplation &amp; self-realization came unexpectedly, spontanteously, and in a much safer setting.

We also see a lot of great character development in season 7.  We see Luke finally letting go of his boat which I think represents a lot for his character. We see Mrs. Kim accepting Lane's life and choices, and embracing them. Emily shows a lot of growth by this point, too, and we have a lot of great moments between her and Lorelai in season 7. 

I could go on, because I feel that there are a lot of great episodes and scenes in this season, but I really think season 7 doesn't deserve so much hate. IMO, season 6 was much worse.",72,138,False,self,,,,,

Liza's acting is so good throughout the show that she stays consistently ""Paris"" while also showing awesome character development. Not to mention her and Michel are the two characters that make me laugh the hardest. She learns to let go of power and trust her abilities to take her where she wants to go. Although Rory should have been way more successful at 30 something than she was in AYitL, I suppose the contrast between her and Paris, highlights Paris's ambition and unwavering motivation to go after what she wants, unlike Rory. Despite being cut-throat and untrusting of her &amp; Rory's friendship, by the end of the show she realizes how important Rory is to the story of Paris, and it finally feels like their friendship is unconditional.

Now, Paris &amp; Doyle. Leave it to the most intense character to have the most intense romance on the show. I love how they just clicked in the speed dating scene and had no intention of talking to anyone else, which of course lead to great sexual chemistry and Doyle being unafraid of all of Paris's crazy. She so needed someone on equal footing mentally, emotionally, and physically after Asher Fleming, and they are perfectly weird together. \[Sidebar: I also found it interesting how Paris chose to stay with Doyle &amp; as she said ""put her relationship first,"" and her career skyrockets &amp; ultimately her relationship with Doyle fails (WHICH I AM FULLY AGAINST) while Rory ""puts her career first"" by not staying with Logan and her career flounders and in the revival she kind of gets back with Logan.\]

1- Basic (this is 5 multiple choice questions, 1 point each)

2- Simple (this is 5 short answer questions, 2 points each)

3- Specific (this is 4 short answer questions, 3 points each, and they're about specific episodes/moments/lines)

4-Oh Shit (this is 1-3 REALLY hard short answer questions. Almost no one got these last time, that's kinda the point).

I'm keeping it mostly short answer because I think that GG is so specific with their references that everyone can remember the answer given the choices and it's supposed to be a little hard ;)

**None of this is going to include AYITL**

Also, **PLEASE NOTE**, I am the only one doing this. I have to type in every single variance of a response. Example:

Question: What is the name of the show?

Answers I have to enter so that Google doesn't mark a correct answer wrong: Gilmore Girls, Gilmore girls, gilmore girls, gilmore Girls.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if your spelling is off, it will be marked as incorrect**. I can't account for all possible spelling errors because I have a full course load. Names are always capitalized. Lorelai is not spelled Lorelei, at least for my quizzes. Numbers are always '8' not 'eight', but I will try to remember to add the spelled out version as well.

LORELAI: You have no right being anything. Rorys my kid and I make the rules, so if she comes home one day and says, Hey, uh, Im gonna spend the weekend with Patricia Krenwinkle and I say, Okay, grab a sweater, you just have to deal.
RICHARD: Who is Patricia Krenwinkle?

LOUISE: Yes, but his company donated some treadmills for the inmates so he swung a special trailer for dinner that theyre gonna set up for us in the parking lot. We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us.

Longtime Gilmore girls fan here. Its finally fall so Im doing a rewatch of the original series and I just watched season 3 episode 8 (Let the Games Begin) and episode 9 (A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving). One aspect of the show that Im struck by as an adult but didnt notice when I watched it as a kid/teenager is Lorelais desire for Rory to go to Harvard. Wanting to go to Harvard is an important part of Rorys identity throughout the first three seasons, and early in season 1 Lorelai admits that shes always wanted Rory to go there. But...she never says why, other than that its an Ivy League school.  

In season 3, Lorelai is adamant that Rory isnt even applying to Yale, and she becomes (rightfully) angry when Richard springs a surprise meeting with the Yale dean of admissions on Rory in episode 8. Then in episode 9 when she finds out that Rory applied to Yale, shes furious and upset, and Emily says to her, You cant even let Rory have one piece of our lives, even if its her choice. You hate us that much.  

That scene got me thinking probably a little too deeply about this particular storyline. First, did Lorelai really think Harvard was the only school Rory was applying to? Thats kind of unheard of, I dont know anyone who only applied to one college. That sounds like a bad idea and a recipe of potential disaster. She either had no idea how the application process works or for some reason she was just THAT sure Rory would get in.  

Secondly, it appears that the only reason Lorelai wants Rory to go to Harvard is to spite her parents, and now that Im watching this as an adult that seems incredibly immature and pointless. Emily is right, Lorelai doesnt Rory to have a piece of their lives, because she remains resentful of them and of her childhood.  

On another note, one of the reasons Yale would be a good choice for Rory is because she could live at home, but she doesnt, which also doesnt make sense to me. If Yale is only 30 minutes from Lorelais house, why spend the extra money to live on campus?

If I have to choose any ""team"" I would have to say Jess, as I love how he eventually matured and grew as a person. But, with how Rory was in the revival, I honestly don't think she deserves Jess.

 I loved Dean when I first watched, and you could say that I was team Dean. His relationship with Rory was so sweet, but then in season 2 it really felt like they changed his character to be more clingy and ""wet-blanket"" like to service Rory and Jess.  

What ultimately disappointed me with Dean was how they took someone who was reflective of the early days of GG and Rory's innocence, and then they tarnished the early beauty of their relationship by having them hook up while Dean was married. Then having Rory and Dean try to date, when he ultimately realizes that they weren't meant to be with each other anymore. Idk, it just kind of sucks to see someone who was such a good BF turn into a loser who cheats on his wife. And his last scene with Rory, when he comes to pick her up from a party at the Gilmore's- it was just so tragic. Dean was definitely right in that he didn't belong there, but still- just so sad to see that that's how their relationship turned out. I'm not saying that I wanted them to stay together, but I never wanted their relationship to turn into that. It was sad.

I always find it interesting that Dean was before Jess, then after Jess, and before Logan. I also thought it was weird that Rory was away at college but yet, chose to rekindle a romance with her first love who lived in her hometown. She had this whole new world at Yale and new opportunities to meet new men but somehow DEAN, a guy she literally lost interest in WHILE dating him and simultaneously falling for Jess, is the guy she wants to be with. Also, I thought it was SO bizarre that they chose to also have Jess briefly come back to say he loves Rory, only for her to turn him away in favor of Dean. Just weird timing, as I said before that she's in college but the writers brought these 2 back when that love triangle was sooo season 2.

I get that Jess was a dissapointment when they dated (I guess for the most part) and Dean was meant to be her security blanket, but still. If Dean hadn't been married that hook up would have been sexy too.",6,6,False,spoiler,,,,,

When Luke is telling Lorelai about marrying Nicole on the cruise, he states that it was a seven country cruise.

Now, they COULD have gone to four other countries on the cruise (Ive already counted the USA and Canada), but that would have included Russia, Japan, and one (or both) Koreas. That just seems silly. 

During Season 3, Lorelai does a very sweet thing for her mother, and buys her a DVD player and several DVDs of musicals, so that her mother can enjoy them at will. She also installs the player, and the entire time, Emily is acting flummoxed by the entire idea of watching movies at home.

Emily, especially in the earlier seasons, often says horrible things to or about Lorelai. She even does it in front of Rory. For example, her quip about Lorelai's potential ""gathering dust in the attic"" in the episode where Rory goes golfing. Or when she and Lorelai go to the spa, and she blames Lorelai for making her ""cheat"" on Richard by dancing with a man. It is clear this is a pattern in their relationship. While I love the character of Emily and would probably love her, I would HATE to be her daughter. It's so clear that Lorelai has dealt with emotional manipulation from both her parents who never truly accepted her for herself, and she spends most of the series dealing with that pretty well and even trying to have a semi-positive relationship with her parents.

- she does not like sherry still, and she didnt like the younger christopher (she thought he didnt resemble him as all)
- she absolutely LOVED the dance marathon episode (personally my favorite episode of the series) but it was funny because we were talking about where lorelai was during the whole dean and rory break up (shes supposed to be in the gym with luke? right? fixing her shoe? why didnt she see everything???)
- she liked the gilmores trip to yale, and as soon as that episode was over she says shes going to yale isnt she. (i was like nooooooooooooo but i have a horrible poker face so i spoiled it sorry mom)
- she still has mixed feelings about paris (more dislike than like unfortunately) but she was still super shocked that she didnt get into harvard. i keep telling her she gets better but shes starting to doubt my judgement
- shes getting frustrated that luke and lorelai are still not together and felt cheated by that dream sequence(i dont blame her i was the exact same way)
- she wasnt thrilled when max came back, and was relieved when i told her that season 3 was the last season he appeared in
- she cried at rorys graduation speech (she was like thats gonna be me at your graduation)

When she gets into Yale, she meets Doyle as the editor, who refuses to publish her articles because he doesn't deem them good enough. She tries writing in her own style but gets rejected again and again. Finally she changes her style and writes a  harsh and crass article about the ballerina and immediately Doyle publishes her it. So we can assume that after that, she keeps writing articles that aren't in accordance with her style, but something that Doyle would appreciate. By the time she gets out of Yale, she has completely changed her style of writing.

Now, her articles not getting in the paper might also be because of the higher standards expected at Yale as compared to Chilton.

But then it is shown that Doyle gets rejected by the Times (or some other publication...Im not sure) , doesn't become a very successful journalist himself and then changes his field altogether in the revival. We're not shown how successful the other ppl working under Doyle become as jounalists. We're only shown about Paris and she chooses a completely different career path.

I've seen one episode a couple of years back, and I couldn't get into the fast-talking pace at that time. This time around I binged the whole thing from start to finish, including the revival within a month. 

So my takeaways: 

1. The fast-talking pace and the multiple pop culture references eventually were things I started to zone out. Was it just me, or was it that as the series went on the references were more numerous? 
2. My all-time favorite character, who grew, who learned, who developed was definitely Paris. The only one that had a satisfying ending from all the characters, in my opinion, was Paris. She turned from the chick that thought having sex made her not get into Harvard, into the one that was coming to a realization that her relationship was a factor in her choosing where and what she wanted to do with her future.   
Fav Paris moment: I know the general consensus is 'national baptism day', but mine is when she's telling off Logan after Rory comes to crash with Paris when she finds out he 'cheated' on her, and he she says: ""if you were to disappear from the face of the planet tomorrow, nobody would miss you except your porshe dealer"". The delivery and the unexpected dialogue made me do a huge tea spit take.  
Hands down my favorite character, and I love her to bits how she was always there for Rory, despite Rory taking her for granted a lot of the time.
3. I disliked Rory after the first two seasons. I can't put my finger on it, but I think the fact that she's so indecisive made me just only see the flaws in her. I won't elaborate too much, but at least in the beginning we knew she was just indecisive emotionally, but by the time the last season and the revival come around, it's clear shes totally indecisive about her career. The only thing she was good at studying and homework. The whole direction her career took was everything Mitchum said it was going to be. 
4. Team Logan. Even though their romance was really rushed, and I wished for a slow burn. He was perfect for her. He grew up, he knew what he wanted, yet gave Rory her space when necessary. The guy really grew a pair and knew she was the love of his life and was again very decisive whereas again Rory said no. Really disappointed, I feel like her life could've gone in a very different direction if she had stayed with logan. Not to mention I would sacrifice my organs before death for every Matt Czuchry smile. I'm not ashamed to admit I pause every time he smiles and I stare for a couple seconds. Okay fine, minutes. Whatever. 
5. Richard and Emily. Nope. In my opinion, there were absolutely no redeemable qualities in either of them. The way they constantly put every other person above Lorelei was hard to watch at times. The last straw for me was when Rory wanted to quit Yale, and after giving Lorelei their word, they totally flipped their stance on the matter. I know people probably think Emily is the one that gave Lorelei more grief, I disagree. She said what she thought, there was no secret that she wanted to maintain some sort of relationship with her daughter. Richard, some of the things he said to Lorelei, man I could feel her hurt. 
6. Lorelei. Her as a character, by herself, flaw and everything included were so loveable. But that's the thing, she's not alone, she comes in a package with Rory. Which in my opinion, they had a very unhealthy mother daughter relationship. There were no boundaries, there was no discipline despite Rory being an easy child. She gave into everything Rory wanted, and the one time I think she should've supported Rory (during her Yale quitting), she totally isolated her. Nope, I don't agree with her parenting at all, but then again it's not like she had a normal upbringing, and she had Rory at 16. She's emotionally stunted, which would've been fine if she wasn't responsible for another human. I really wish she would've gone through therapy after breaking up with Luke, but instead, she ran to Christopher.   
One thing I will say if I had gone through all the crap she did go through I would've collapsed a long long time ago. She's one hell of a strong woman. For that reason I kind of love her. 
7. Christopher. Crap father. Crap partner. Crap husband. 
8. Dean. Pushover, spineless, barbie. But he only became those things after his initial motorcycle introduction. Dunno why they turned him into the spineless boy.
9. Jess. Not going to say much here, he was horrible to Rory. Until he wrote the book, he turned his life around, got more mature, and just grew the fuck up. Present day he is too good for Rory. 
10. Luke. I don't know what to say about Luke. I don't love him, I also don't hate him. He was great until the Anna April fiasco. My favorite Luke was reading books to take initiative to ask Lorelei out. Or when he said he liked seeing her happy. But those moments were few, and the horrible things he said to Lorelei, I just didn't feel enough remorse and enough guilt to be satisfied with his apology. They changed his character, and I can't say I like it.
11. As a whole, after season 5 I had a hard time watching. The series went on downward spiral in season 6/7 in my opinion. 
12. The revival. I pretend I never watched it, and the series as a whole ended for me with Luke and Lorelei kissing at the end of season 7.

So I know my thoughts are everywhere, and I know there's probably a lot people disagree with me on. But overall I loved the show. The show is a peppermint mocha while wearing a huge sweater and fuzzy socks while its a blizzard outside kind of feeling.",37,132,False,self,,,,,

He managed to be a friend to Lorelai, an actual friend who went with her to Lane's wedding and didn't try anything or do anything that wasn't unfriend-like. He was a good platonic date.

Where did April sleep before the revival whenever Luke moved back in with Lorelai? You know, back when she was a minor. Did Luke stay above the diner with her or did she stay in Rory's room and just hadn't been there for a while when the revival came around?

If Rory truly didn't feel comfortable giving her room up or sharing a room with Gigi then where did Lorelai expect Gigi to sleep since she didn't want her to have Rory's room at first nor did she want to get a new house?

2- Simple (this is 5 short answer questions, 2 points each)

3- Specific (this is 4 short answer questions, 3 points each, and they're about specific episodes/moments/lines)

4-Oh Shit (this is 1-3 REALLY hard short answer questions. Almost no one got these last time, that's kinda the point).

I'm keeping it mostly short answer because I think that GG is so specific with their references that everyone can remember the answer given the choices and it's supposed to be a little hard ;)

**None of this is going to include AYITL**

Also, **PLEASE NOTE**, I am the only one doing this. I have to type in every single variance of a response. Example:

Question: What is the name of the show?

Answers I have to enter so that Google doesn't mark a correct answer wrong: Gilmore Girls, Gilmore girls, gilmore girls, gilmore Girls.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if your spelling is off, it will be marked as incorrect**. I can't account for all possible spelling errors because I have a full course load. Names are always capitalized. Lorelai is not spelled Lorelei, at least for my quizzes. Numbers are always '8' not 'eight', but I will try to remember to add the spelled out version as well.

My wife looooves Gilmore Girls &amp; she finally got me to watch it. I gotta say - Im hooked. We started watching last month &amp; Im halfway through season 6. 
Am I missing something with Christopher? Like am I supposed to root for him &amp; Lorelai to get back together? I cant stand the dude. He has such a punchable face. Every time he disappears for a while, I  secretly hope its the last time we see him. 

For those of you who watched the show as it aired, were you rooting for their relationship? Am I alone in hating him? Or am I stating the obvious &amp; you are all thinking well yea! He sucks!

do we think it's intentional? it just struck me as odd because with Rory it's such a huge deal every time she says it or someone says it to her (which is kind of fair since she's younger) but Luke and Lorelai got engaged without us ever hearing either one of them say it in so many words. like of course they express it in other ways and say things like ""I'm all in"", it's just weird to me that they've never said ""I love you"" before.",9,6,False,self,,,,,

During the original run, I didnt think about these questions, but now that I am a mother to a little girl thats 1.5 years old (roughly Rorys age when they moved out), I cant fathom how she did it all (obviously I know its TV land where things just work out, but Id like to consider the possibilities and try to create some sort of fan made fictional backstory).
