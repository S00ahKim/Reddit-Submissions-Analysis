It's been a fun time sink so far.  

About me: I'm a guy in my early 30s.  I was a 17 year old college freshman when the series first aired.  I used to tell people that I watched in part because both the protagonists were just so ""my type"", which was a believable pretext considering that my college gf was an impossibly smart, blue-eyed, tall, fair-skinned brunette.  She even walked to class wearing a bright yellow backpack like Rory's.  But deep down I was all about the quick-paced banter between Lorelai and Rory.  At the time I very much identified with Rory's goal of getting into a dream school.  On this, my first complete watch-through, I'm much more aware of the male characters, but can't say I identify with anyone other than maybe Marty before he got all weird.  

Observations/Opinions:  

* In the early seasons it seems to me like every male character is really shallowly written.  Lorelai and Rory get explored more fully for obvious reasons, but I can't help but feel that all the men are little more than caricatures.  I shudder to think that this is what women have to deal with when watching tv shows and movies that aren't specifically woman-centric.  
* I wonder if people making TV shows 15 years ago ever envisioned their audience binge-watching their work the way we do now with the availability of Netflix and DVD box sets.  For me, the theme song became unbearable after about the 30th episode.  
* If ever there was a character for whom ""shipping"" factions was unnecessary it must be Rory Gilmore.  All of her boyfriends are terrible.  If I had to choose someone for her I pick the economics TA that takes over Richard's class because she's instantly attracted to him and we saw so little of him we didn't get to find out what horrible personality flaw made him so interesting to Rory.  
* I may be imagining things, but did the visual style of the show change drastically during the estrangement between Lorelai and Rory?  I felt like the camera angles, lighting and depth all felt ""off"" during those episodes.  Could that have been a choice by the show creators to make us feel just how wrong it was for Lorelai and Rory to be at odds?
* How has nobody murdered Taylor yet?  
* I actually like April.  Or rather, I like what her character could have brought to the show had Lorelai and Luke made different choices.  Yes, she's a bit of a Scrappy Doo/Cousin Oliver but I would have liked to see her incorporated into the Lorelai/Rory/Luke family.  I really liked what Lorelai does for her and her friends with the makeover/sleepover party.  It felt like an insight into how Lorelai molded Rory during the years before the story starts.  And by making her as bookish as Rory I hoped we would have slowly been shown that somebody could out-Rory Rory.  That maybe Rory wasn't as good and virtuous as all of Stars Hollow was convinced she was.  Maybe April could have even provided Rory an opportunity to pass on the wisdom of her experience and growth.  But mostly I liked April because it made me like Luke.

- Luke and Lorelai Wedding;

- Luke and Lorelai new family (a boy would make a difference?);

- How was Rory's first Job and where is she working now.

... and go from there, and try to create the same surprising dynamics for the show.

However:

- Melissa McCarthy probably won't be on the show because she's doing a lot of stuff somewhere else, and won't be on Dragonfly Inn as chef, this should be explained somehow;

- A closure for the absense of Edward Herrmann as a Funeral for Richard Gilmore.

- A completely different approach for Emily Gilmore as a widow. Something must be done about her and it's difficult to think her as someone that would be stuck at Hartfort doing nothing.

- Paris maybe would be Paris, or maybe would be a complete different woman by now after marrying Doyle (or not, because Doyle wouldn't be avaiable in GG as well);

Maybe if there would be seasons, Winter would be a season of morrow, starting with Richard's burial, all family united?

Summer would be the seasons for marriage... Would Rory have a soon to be husband as well?

- Lorelai gave Luke the ultimatum, he didn't react, and she slept with Christopher.  
- Logan went to London, and Rory stayed in his apartment.  
- Lane and Zach got married (I just realized, they use L-names a lot!)

- Jess and Rory.
- Marty and Rory. He professed his love for her, and they just kind of didn't see each other after that.  
- Anna being unreasonably strict with Luke, when she never told him about April.

- Rory cheating on Logan and ending up with Jess.

I actually woke up scared and feeling anxious, lol. 

I'm just past the point in the season where she is really mean to Luke. Luke, in my estimation, is a pretty normal upstanding guy. He's not rich, but he owns his own business and does well enough for himself. Emily is still a total a-hole to him though, and it got me thinking...

If she treated Luke like that, how would she perceive me? Someone who doesn't own their own business and works for other people all the time. Yikes.

Obviously nothing is official until Netflix confirms it, but here's what I've seen (I'm sure everyone has seen some of this, but hopefully there's some new stuff too!):

* [Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Kelly Bishop, and Scott Patterson will be the main players as always](https://tvline.com/2015/10/19/gilmore-girls-revival-netflix-new-episodes/)

Thats everything I can think of! Since were probably going to hear something official pretty soon, I thought it would be fun to throw everything weve heard out there and speculate on what it means! I'll update this as more info comes out, but feel free to add anything I miss! I tried to include sources for everything, but if youve seen or heard something really interesting and cant remember where its from, Id still love to hear it! Ahhhhh, Im so excited! None of these pictures, tumblr pages, twitters, etc. are mine by the way!
