Do you guys remember the episode when Rory her coming out debutante ball? 

In the beginning at Luke's, Jess comes downstairs wearing a Metallica T-shirt. Luke yells at him to change his shirt.
Jess says: ""I like this shirt."" With the most serious scowl. ""because it brings out my eyes."" And then scenes later, after Rory's coming out, the girls go eat a burger at luke's.
Jess comes downstairs wearing a flannel shirt and a backwards baseball hat.
Jess is cleaning tables while Luke tries to pretend it doesn't bother him.
luke- ""what are you wearing!""
Jess- *with slight smile* ""oh, I'm sorry.. I thought this was the uniform.""
Luke-""That's it!! Get upstairs and change!!""
Jess- ""Whatever you say, Uncle Luke."" 
Luke- ""that's luke to you! No, call me mr. luke. In fact, don't say my name AT ALL!""

I love Jess.(&amp; luke of course)
why do the rest of you love jess?

NOTE:	This was from memory, not verbatim but I think its very very close.",0,1,False,default,,,,,
