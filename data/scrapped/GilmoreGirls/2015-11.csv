(Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/3rsgs4/why_do_people_dislike_april_spoilers/,NotReals,1446833239,"I have been struggling with this one since I discovered Gilmore Girls discussions online. People seem to really dislike April and I never quite understand why. I remember liking the character way back when the show was first airing, and in re-watching it my attitude hasn't changed.

- Her addition does feel forced. They wanted to add tension and thought this would be an interesting way of adding it. But the way she is introduced felt anything but organic. This, however, is a folly of the writers, not the character of April. Once I got past the way she was introduced, I liked her.

- To say she impedes Luke and Lorelai's marriage not entirely fair. I put this mostly on Lorelai. Does she not know Luke at all? Can he not see how insecure he is about April and how much he just wants to figure out how to be her dad before incorporating her into their lives?

- Luke is not without fault, I know. He waited 2 months to tell Lorelai about April (this was really bad, but they could and did move past it), and he did kept her out of the loop for too long (he should have gone to Anna and been upfront about how Lorelai would eventually be part of April's life, but I reckon he was very nervous about it because Anna was on the fence about Luke being part of April's life in the first place).

So far, her introduction is a folly of the writers, but I can easily get past that. Luke's nervousness and April's lack of interaction with Lorelai is a folly of Luke (and Anna). Lasly, Luke and Lorelai break up by and large because of Lorelai's immaturity.

- She issues him an ultimatum with very little warning. ""Now or never""? Really? After flat out making him wait for her and Rory to get back together and completely ignoring his advice on the matter, when you get a parallel situation it's suddenly now or never?

- She completely buries her true feelings about April, and there is a consistent pattern of her being less than honest with Luke throughout the 6th season. Luke lied big one time. He apologized, came clean, and thought they moved on. But Lorelai gradually distances herself from Luke as a reaction, instead of being mature about it and talking to him.

- When he (understandably IMO) doesn't know how to react to her ultimatum, instead of sleeping on it like a normal human, *she sleeps with Christopher.*

I can 100% get a negative attitude towards Anna, but why April?",34,21,False,self,,,,,

I know that most people are divided about who they like the best, and of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I'm not saying he's a bad person by any means, but I'm watching mid season 2 starting from the A-Tisket, A-Tasket episode and how quick he is to get mad at Rory really bothers me. I know he's a nice guy but his behavior during this time, although I understand is justified in realizing that Jess was messing with him, certainly doesn't give him the right to yell at Rory like that. It's a tough time for her as well since clearly she's developing feelings for him, but up until the kiss at the wedding she didn't cross major lines. For some people though, I can understand that just interacting with someone who clearly likes you would be inappropriate. I guess I just feel conflicted for her cause it sucks that she's developing feelings for someone else but at the same time people can't control who they like and seeing her be so conflicted made me feel sympathetic.

Then we could see her funny, if predictable food cravings, or less predictably, an inability to tolerate junk food. And the show would end with Luke holding his baby son.

Lane still doesn't like sex. There has to be some comic complaint from Zack about her voraciousness.

Paris and Dole aren't together anymore. There might be some conflict that needs to resolved in the relationship, but they need to end together.

The town and inn hasn't flourished. This would be the most horrifying thing. No Westons but a Starbucks, no Doose's but a Walmart.

No information about what happened to the boyfriends. I'd like to see Dean's wife had gotten off her ass and made something of herself and thank Rory for breaking up her marriage. Jess, maybe a prominent novelist, maybe will grant Rory an interview. Dean I think will just be working construction. Logan could still be one for her, matured.

For Lorelai my answer would be the way she acted when her father cut a deal with Styles and betrayed Jason. That was an awful thing to do, but Richard did it to protect his family since he set his entire fortune as collateral and would loose it in a lawsuit. Lorelai didn't even once think about her parents or worried about their future - she only cared about what happens to her boyfriend (whom, let's be honest, she didn't exactly cared deeply about since she wasn't really sad after their break-up; plus, it took her like five seconds to start dating Luke, which, yaaay, but still). It made me so sad when Richard pointed this out after Lorelai attacked him; he said that he didn't expect her to act any differently. That was one of the most heartbreaking moments on GG.

I hated when Rory joy-rode that yacht. Since when is it okay to take someone else's property? That coming from a girl who once was shocked that she stole a box of cornstarch is just sad. I just don't get how she could justify it to herself while doing it, and it didn't seem that she was sorry at all. She regretted it because of the consequences, but she never really felt sorry for taking something that didn't belong to her, which was the whole Dean thing all over again (not that I'm comparing Dean to a boat, I just mean the I-just-take-all-the-things-I-want-and-am-only-sorry-for-myself-when-I-am-caught-and-things-blow-up attitude that Rory often has).",44,29,False,self,,,,,

It was the episode where we meet TJ and Jess comes back to get his car. I noticed a few times that some of the dialogue was silenced out, I think a crap from Luke and an ass from Jess. I looked up the channel and apparently it's a Christian channel for religious and family based programming, which leaves me curious about how they'll handle some of the more risqu moments/storylines in the show - I'm already past the Paris has sex with Jamie episode but there's still lots more Paris sex to come, plus Rory and Dean, Lorelei in bed with every one of her boyfriends, Rory living with Logan, Rory sexting Logan,  Lorelei sleeping with Christopher after breaking up with Luke, etc.


I'm not a religious person myself, so I'm probably the wrong person to be speculating on where/how they'll be drawing the lines. I don't see how they could cut it and still keep the story in tact or have a full ""hour"" of programming for each episode...but if crap and ass are being edited out I can't see a ton of pre-marital sexing making the cut either.

I am half way through season four at the moment (go Lane, should have done that ages ago) and need to rant about Taylor and how I feel like I have a personal connection to him. 

That character affects me personally as I came from a small town and they had a group of Taylors. It was a real Kafkaesk nightmare.   

My father owns two acres of land and when I moved out, there was nobody to cut the grass, so he decided to grow it into a field.   

But NOOOOO not on Taylor's watch. ""Well you see it's just not that pretty to look at."" Never mind that in no way is it his problem or land. A month, a lawyers letter and two bailiffs later, Taylor got his way.   

So my father did it what Taylor demanded, in his own way. He took out ALL the grass from his the land, planted juniper bushes instead, cut down the two, three story tall sentinel pines in front of the house and sent Taylor a clear message, this one : http://imgur.com/cxvF4mS  

But what really sent me over the edge, to the point where I had to walk away from Gilmore Girls for awhile was the episode with the Dragonfly Inn.   

The SAME thing happened when my father attempted to build his building on a plot je bought.   

First off, in the episode, Taylor had NO rights, AT ALL and Lorelai could have just ignored him.   

1- It was not a historical building when she bought it  

2- If it WAS a historical building, then there would already have been clear outlines of what or what not to do and how to or not do it  

3- You can't just declare something as historical and place it in the books. The owners have to agree to it.  

It just looks like Taylor wanted to play dress up and people listen to him because they just give him authority without question. The last time we heard about the Stars Hollow Historical Society it was just Taylor. He dreamt that up over night. Unfortunately, my town had more Taylors than Lukes.   


My father bought an old plot of land from a farmer, to build his building on it. The town was 100% behind my father, it will give people jobs, help the economy, etc. Go for it.   

Then comes the Taylors. ""But wait now, that plot of land you bought has a barn on it. You can't tear down a hundred year old barn! It's historical! You'll have to build around it.""   

What.   

Cue town meeting  
Outrage! 

""Do we even need a new building? I don't. Why you building this again? Your business? Haven't you already got a place? Oh, so just because you are expanding means you think you should build up?"" 

Ah! But here comes Luke for the upset! ""Hold on a second! One: It's not a hundred year old barn, it's fifty years old. Two, I built it myself and was going to tear it down but never got around to it!""  

Taylor: ""Sit down Luke this doesn't concern you.""  

Anyways, that was sorted out. But then, the building starts up! Good thing my father got building permit E!  

""Well no, what we require is building permit C."" What are you talking about Taylor? Building permit E is two levels higher than building permit C, covers more items, some of which I will need covered later on! ""Well I don't know where you got that idea from, but this construction site can not be declared legal unless you got C. Then, later on you can have E."" That's not how it works, Taylor!   

""But what about the parking spots? How many will you have?""  

Gravel Taylor, it's being filled with Gravel. You have NxN parking space.   

""Well that's no goooood. Where are the handicap parking spots for visitations? ""  

What? This is a closed workshop, not a store. I don't require handicap park shots.   

"" I just think that if you fill it in with pavement instead of gravel it would be much better and cleanner looking ""  

That would force me to require handicap parking spots, which would reduce my available area, which in turn blocks me from being able to accept delivery trucks.
