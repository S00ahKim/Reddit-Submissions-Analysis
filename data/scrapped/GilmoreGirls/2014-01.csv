RORY

1. Logan - I liked him the best. He was a bit of a jerk at times but he pushed Rory to be a better person and made her take risks and calm down and have fun. And she was good for him too.
2. Dean - He was sweet and reliable and supported Rory. But he was way too content with a boring and ordinary life. And Rory was made for bigger and better things. 
3. Jess - Jess was smart, but he didn't take his life or education seriously and he just ran away... multiple times and never said goodbye. Flight risk.


LORELAI

1. Christopher - He was Rory's dad and they have a history and had so many fun inside jokes and they knew each other better than anyone. Plus they just clicked and felt right. I feel like they could have worked if he hadn't have got another woman pregnant.
2. Luke and Max (tie) - I like Luke more than Max, but Max seemed like a better fit for Lorelai. They both really loved her, but I feel like Max was more willing to travel and live a more exciting life and Lorelai needs excitement. Luke is a sweetheart and also loved Lorelai, but he's too content with staying in Stars Hollow forever. But Luke loved her more.
3. Jason - He was fun, but suing Richard? No.
4. Alex - Yeah, he never had a chance.

Maybe that number is accurate to what was delivered to the Dragon Fly, but there are bundles of daisies all over town and Rory and Lorelai are giving them out to every one-it just doesn't add up!  I've tried to look it up to see how many daisies were actually used during filming and have come up empty handed, does any one know?
