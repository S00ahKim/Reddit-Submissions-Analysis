I think the bomb means Jess as endgame is done.  (And #teamLogan fans, don't be too smug.  It isn't as clear a hint, but there's one I included in the comments below that doesn't look to good for you, either.)

Okay, here's the transcription from about a minute at 1:13:20:
https://soundcloud.com/gilmore-guys/gilmore-guys-a-gilmore-47

Host: Did it feel like when you were on the show, Jess was gonna end up with Rory, or was it one of those things like - I'm passing through, I'm in, I'm out, I'm a vagabond?

Milo: Yeah, I never expected Jess to be the last stop.  I never did.  *I think he was the guy she had to learn a lot about life from.  That was it.*  It was never going to be Jess (adds quickly) in my mind.

Listen to it.  Listen again.  It's the finality in his voice that makes me 99.9% percent sure it's over for #TeamJess.  Listen and tell me!!  Logan shippers, I'll include the possible clue in a comment.  Keep all Logan-related chatter to within that comment thread, please.

Edit: It isn't just the finality. It's that he uses present tense when he says, ""I think..."" instead of ""I thought.""

While I personally disagree, that is a whole other discussion. In my opinion, if Rory doesn't end up with him it's ok. This is because Logan was a great stepping stone into self-discovery for Rory.

* Logan makes Rory appreciate that she comes from means. Her mother obviously is not rich, but she goes so long wanting to believe that she ISN'T a very privileged and supported girl. Associating in Logan's world, as well as Logan pointing out that she's a hypocrite, makes Rory see that she is a lot luckier than she acknowledged for a long time.

* He allowed her to find her way through that breakdown of hers. Now, this is where I personally don't like him very much, BUT I realize that it was probably actually the best thing for Rory. For months she ran around with the DAR and doing nothing in particular, and he was there for her the whole time. He didn't try to influence her in any particular direction.

* Both of these previous items make it seem like she should totally end up with him, but this is where I think it's critical. SHE CHOSE HER FUTURE OVER HIM. That is so pivotal, and it seems like a lot of people didn't appreciate that. She was crazy in love with Logan, but she decided to move on with her career instead.

Logan was a great boyfriend for the transition into adulthood and adult relationships. But just because he was a great boyfriend for 
early 20's Rory, does not mean that he's going to be perfect for 30's Rory. ",33,23,False,self,,,,,

Usually as series go on, the character becomes a little more like the actor since the writers are now writing WITH that actor in mind. Examples: HIMYM, Modern Family - where they take story lines from the actor's lives like Canada or Fizbo.

I don't think we'll get more Gilmore Girls.

But with the expected high ratings for A Year in the Life, Do you think that it's possible that Netflix would commission a spin-off set in Stars Hollow to cash in on it? Not following a character that we know and love, but kind of a reboot following someone new who moves to town? Maybe capitalizing on the well known Gilmore Guys podcast and actually giving us a Gilmore Guys show following a single dad and his son, or a single dad and his daughter? I think this could be very interesting and of course characters that we know and love could pop in from time to time. What do you all think? Any other spin offs you'd want to see?

I believe she is the **only** celebrity/human that would elicit such a starstruck reaction from me. I'm not sure I could say anything to her she hasn't heard a million times before but it would be remiss of me not to tell her what an impact she's had on my life if I ever got the chance.

At around 27:14 minutes in, Lorelai and Rory are at Luke's, after Lorelai went to ask for money from her parents. We get the [establishing shot](http://puu.sh/p8jxD/d126d4b1e8.jpg). We can clearly see Lorelai and Rory to the right, at the table by the window; it's also the famous final shot in the pilot. That lasts about 3 seconds, before we [cut to inside the diner](http://puu.sh/p8jCt/f1873c3d0a.jpg), where Rory and Lorelai are wearing completely different clothes! That previous shot was obviously copied and pasted in there from the last scene (probably for time) and it's no big deal, but I just noticed it for the first time after 359465842 rewatches and I thought I'd share!",21,17,False,self,,,,,

Personally, I think I might have nailed it down. It's between Ep 10 and 11 in season five. Lorelai still has the stargazed face at the end of epsiode 10 after their small fight and it seems like the next epsiode their chemistry comes off as more of a married couple.

Alexis looks quite a bit older and her hair seems shorter than it was in promo materials nearer to Season 7. Maybe we are amping up for the revival!? Or maybe this is still an old thumbnail, lol... either way, I'm excited! 

Update: u/gk21 discovered this photo is in fact from a Season 5 promo. Sorry for setting off any bit of frenzy, but it's really nice to see everyone so excited and open to discussion!
