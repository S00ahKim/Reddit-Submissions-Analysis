Why does he feel the need to integrate himself into the life of a daughter that seems to have no need for or interest in a father figure. April comes to the diner, seeking out Luke purely out of science. She is not driven by a burning need to know who fathered her, and she seems to have a strong sense of self. Anna also seems completely fine without him, and both are pretty ambivalent to the whole thing. 

So does Luke insert himself out of some misplaced familial obligation? It just feels weird to me that he is campaigning so hard. April and Anna do not particularly need or want him there, from what I can tell...

But all the weird might be stemming from the fact that this plot is completely useless, serving only to break up Luke and Lorelai. We didn't need to see Luke with kids, because he is already the pseudo-father to both Rory and Jess.

The men in the girls lives tend to behave irrationally jealous when it comes to one another. 

Luke and Chris - Chris absolutely hates Luke because of his friendship/relationship with Lorelai. So jealous to the point they started fighting after seeing one another. There was absolutely no trust from Chris with Lorelai being around Luke. He treated her terribly about the whole thing and behaved like an immature brat. Luke equally disliked Christopher and behaved almost as bad, highlighted by the phone message scene at the house.

Jess and Dean - Dean turned into full-blown control freak when Jess came into town. Yes, it was obvious that Rory felt some sort of attraction to Jess, however, she would have never acted on it if it were not for Dean's behavior. He pushed Rory out of his life by constantly being aggressive about Jess and frequently checking up on her. I hated this side of Dean (though I am not a fan of Dean overall) because you watch him destroy the relationship due to not trusting Rory. Jess equally got jealous over Dean when he tried to worm his way back into Rory's life (highlighted by the winter festival scene). Again, no trust from Jess, either.

Logan and Marty/Jess - Logan showed his spoiled upbringing by mocking both Marty and Jess for their lack of money/social standings. He was jealous of the fact that Marty was friends with Rory their freshman year and destroyed not only what little was left between Rory and Marty, but also broke up Marty and his girlfriend with his revelation that Marty knew Rory (I also never understood this break-up either since Marty and Rory were NEVER a couple.....). As for Jess, he took one look at Jess and immediately bullied him mercilessly. Logan showed no regards for their feelings, nor understanding of the situation. He behaved like a jealous jerk.

Why is it that the men in their lives behaved this way? Doesn't anyone else think it weird that the girls couldn't/didn't have any male friends unless they were either married, foreign, or stereotypical nerdy looking? These guys showed serious trust issues and lashed out. This is hardly a trait I would look for in a guy so why would the girls deal with it? It seems like it would've been easier all around to just dump them if they couldn't trust the girls or handle that guys can just be friends without ulterior motives. 

Gil: Married  
Brian: Stereotypical nerdy looking guy  
Michel: Foreign  
Jackson: Dated Sookie, then married her  
Taylor: (most likely) Gay busybody  
Kirk: Quirky (annoying as hell) town freak  
Tobin: Effeminate weird guy (that you just want to punch, for some reason)  
Doyle: Dating Paris (most likely married her)  
Brad: Stereotypical nerd  
Morey: Married to Babette  
Tom: Married construction worker  
T.J: Married Liz  


I guess what I'm getting at is; unless the men are married, weird, or obviously gay, the girls did not socialize with single men or be friends with them. Why? 


You'll have noticed I left out some men, like Max and Jason. I left out Max because he showed no jealously towards other men. As for Jason, I absolutely, positively HATE the man. Jason Stiles is nothing but a pretentious, self-important, slimy, oily, ugly-as-hell excuse of a man. I cannot stand him, at all. He lacks sympathy, has no patience, an annoying voice, and I REALLY do not like how he treats his dog. The fact he never interacts with his dog shows how uncaring of a man he is. Hate this man.....so much. ",35,17,False,self,,,,,

Most of the time they are rushed into much too quickly. Here's my list:

-Max's proposal to Lorelai: as romantic as his proposal was, getting married is a ridiculous solution to 'breaking a bad pattern' and a poor start to a marriage.

-Dean &amp; Lindsey: much too young and of course the fact that Dean was still in love with Rory.

-Luke &amp; Nicole: Luke is slow to make any decisions in his life, but then he suddenly marries Nicole on a cruise, what the heck was that all about?

-Zach &amp; Lane: yeah they had a cool wedding and all but he just majorly f***d up but instead of apologising and atoning for his behaviour he proposes instead. I don't know why Lane would want to marry someone who had acted so badly recently and not done anything about it.

-Chris &amp; Lorelai: even if you are a fan of Chris I'm sure you'll agree this wedding  was all kinds of wrong! Yes, they had known each other for years, but not as a couple. Plus she was on the rebound! That marriage was doomed to failure.

In fact the only wedding that had a decent build-up to it was Sookie and Jackson.

For example when she invites Luke and Jess over for dinner and she says 'Sookie will cook'. She didn't ask if it was okay with Sookie and she gets to take all the credit because she was the one to do the inviting. Even if it is understood between them that Lorelai can rely on Sookie to cook for her, surely she could at least check with her first that she doesn't have something else on.
