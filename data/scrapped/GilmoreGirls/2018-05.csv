Was it really so fashionable back then to dress so strictly? It isn't fun at all to watch. I'm asking because in season 2 her clothes really improved, so how come the change happened so fast?

\- Furthermore, clothing choices for \*every\* character in season 4\-7 can still be considered fashionable today, and some I still regard as daily inspiration. I sometimes find myself pausing an episode to get a better look at Lorelai or Rory's outfits, especially in seasons 4 and 5 \- even though it's funny to see how some of the trends now look so dated. Like the semi\-vintage\-y looking long pearl necklaces, and the too\-short cropped jackets.

\- For the guys on the show, I'm still digging the look of seasons 3\-4 \(like Dave and Jess\) \- I was so attracted to the skater\-indie look when I was watching the show as a teenager. I don't even mind all the loose\-fitting corduroy pants. It was back when the hipster look emerged \(2003\-2004\), and it's very cool in my eyes. It goes so well with the band rehearsals in the garage and Jess and Brian's \(Zack's?\) huge old cars. 

\- Why does Lane wear that ratty sweater to every shift at Luke's? It doesn't look like uniform...

\- I love every denim moment I see on anyone, at any given season.

\-  I like how aesthetically pleasing most of the clothes are still looking today. Overall, I think the show's fashion aged very well, as opposed to other shows of that time. Props to the costume designers for their classical taste. I think it requires a certain sensibility, and maybe some deeper foresight into the future generations that may get hooked on the show \(but I might be exaggerating\).

I have just watched the episode where Richard arranges the interview for yale behind everyone's back for the billionth time, and it becomes evermore clear. They think they know best. always. 
Yes Richard does know more about the college applications but it doesn't seem to end here they consistently interfering in Rory's life and telling Lorelai that they know what is best for her this evident with the interview and Richard says that Rory's education is more important than offending her as Lorelai doesn't already know this, she is fine with Rory going to yale as evident when they make their pro and cons list but she wants it to be Rory's choice not because Richard wants it. 
The same thing happens again when Rory gets back together with Dean when she is in college and they take it upon themselves to introduce her to guys with a higher social standing and cutting Lorelai out completely. 
It happens earlier than this too when Rory runs off from Lorelai after her first break up with Dean, Emily refuses to let Lorelai speak to Rory which is completely out of order, she should have at least asked Rory if she wanted to speak to Lorelai we all know what the answer would have been but it wasnt Emily's place at the end of the day Lorelai is Rory's mother

another time this becomes evident is much later in the series when Lorelai and Rory aren't speaking and Rory is at the Russian tea party and Emily has a go at her and says 'wait until your father comes home' its a moment that shows us that Emily had always wanted to be the daughter that Lorelai wasn't and they had always wanted to treat her like she was their daughter...or at least that is the way I interpret things

I just love how in spite of how different they are in the surface, they are great friends in every sense of the word. 

First and foremost: they have a really fun dynamic and play each other off very well. Their banter is on point. 

On a deeper level, an important part of the bond between them is how much they get each other and can understand the real meaning behind each others actions, and that how they can mock and trash on the follies of humanity - and have fun while theyre at it - together. I love how they are both very private people, yet they constantly confide in each other and let their guards down around the other. I love that Luke is the first person that Lorelai tells that shes ready to open her own inn all the way back in season 2 and not only does to tell her that he thinks she can hack anything and gives her advice on how to do it but that he actually loans her the money that she needs to pull it off. I love that when Luke is having trouble with Rachel or Jess, Lorelai is the person he goes to in order to vent and that she helped him organizing his uncle Louies funeral and convinced the reenactors to play when they had initially refused. Both can give each other reality checks like nobodys business when they feel that the other needs it but only because they want the best from and for each other.

I am rewatching the series at the moment and am on Season 7. The way I see it is, there is definitely a strong attraction between Rory and Logan. I can see why Rory is so besotted with him. He is smart, worldly, confident and super duper rich! Hes a major catch for any girl who dreams of marrying well. We know from Season 1 that Rory yearns for a life more than small town Stars Hallow. She wants to learn, travel the world and have a prestigious career. We also learn upon her introduction to her grandparents that she, like her grandmother Emily, has a major affinity for the finer things in life. She adores her grandfather and naturally gravitates towards sophisticated, high achieving worldly men.  In addition, she herself tends to be a little timid and gun shy and as such is attracted to people who bring some sort of excitement in her life and push her out of her comfort zone. Keeping all of these observations in consideration, It is easy to see what she sees in Logan. He is her Mr. Big. He is larger than life and bombastic and as far away from her small town middle class upbringing. One can forgive the girl for being bewitched! 

However, the above points do not alone paint the full picture of what we know about Rory Gilmore. As much as she loves excitement, world travel and adventure, we must recall that Lorelai strives and succeeded in giving her daughter a very loving and stable life. Everyone Rory encountered growing up was there, dependable and reliable. Lorelai was adamant about this and we see that Rory, too holds this personality trait in high regard. We know how much she loved Deans reliability and dependability. Even though he was boring and kinda dumb she craved his ever present love and the security he provided. And Logan we know well...is not any of that. Her relationship with Logan has always been rocky with highs and lows. One minute theyre being cute and couple-y, the next he is cheating on her with multiple girls. One minute theyre planning a grand Asian adventure the next Logan is on a plane to London offering her only a long distance relationship.  Then theres the matter of his gross impulsiveness and recklessness. His Life and Death brigade antics left him almost killed and his drunken shenanigans ugh his hooligan buddies is immature and super risky. Rory has always tolerated this side of him and hasnt seemed very supportive or encouraging of his irresponsible antics. We know from looking at how Rory deals with her irresponsible, immature and absentee father that Rory isnt a big fan of these characteristics, It is in fact this hot and cold, risky, irresponsible behavior that had her immediately  turn away from Jess even though his charm and smarts initially attracted her. 

Then theres also the matter of his meddling crazy awful family. Rory has seen first hand the damage toxic parents and overbearing responsibilities can do to a person first having seen her mother endure her parents and secondly when she herself with with her grandparents while she had time off at Yale.  She has also shown a strong aversion to mingling with or entertaining any of the vast familial responsibilities and duties that come with being a part of the Huntzberger clan.  During her relationship with Logan we see that Rory is on the other side, theres Logan and his family and then theres Rory.  

It would be different if Logan had demonstrated himself to be strong and willful enough to separate himself from the Huntzbergers similar to what Lorelai did with her parents. But we see time and time again that he doesnt. He complains and whines about his dynastic plan and yet at the end of the day he goes ahead and fulfills his obligations to his family at great cost to her personal mental health AND his relationship to Rory. 

Rory is also not raised to be like Shira Huntsberger. She has always been spoiled with love and attention and would pretty soon find being second place in Logans life to be and unsustainable position.

Theres also the fact that despite her immense privilege and navet Rory is usually a down to earth girl whos best friend through the years remains Lane and her mom. She also adores Luke a grumpy undereducated diner owner. As much as she likes the finer things in life, she isnt snobby enough to endure the kind of ugly condescension coming from Logan and his hooligans. During the series we see her put up with them but also tell them off multiple times. At his core Logan isnt a down to earth decent guy but an egotistical jerk with anger issues who can very easily resort to intimidation and being a jerk to people he views beneath him.

In short,Logan was the perfect first real adult relationship for Rory and she learned a lot from what she likes and dislikes in a man. The perfect man for her would indeed be smart, ambitious, worldly but who ultimately comes through for her and is dependable and reliable too. Logan is her stepping stone, not end game.

At the beginning he was so young and immature . When Lorelai left from with little Rory, he just wasn't capable to follow her. I mean, he literally couldn't have, right?
Chris is still very weak and unreliable later on, so much weaker than Lorelai. 

Chris has always seen Lorelai and Rory inseparable, and that is his biggest problem. He proposed to Lorelai several times, he wanted to be with them both.

But I still enjoy imagining that she was happier sooner, and that she didn't have to struggle as much, or go through as many hardships on her own. Sometimes I imagine what I would have done in Luke's place - there is no replacing Luke, but I just wonder what it would be like to be in his position, and have a chance to love her. This might sound silly but it is satisfying on some level to imagine all every-day things I would have like to do. To make her nice dinners, and keep the house clean for her. To give her back rubs and foot rubs and take care of her when she's sick. To make sure her and Rory are always warm and have a ride anywhere they need to go.

Because she didn't want to yet. Why should there need to be any other reason? It doesn't matter that, objectively, marrying Logan wouldn't have impacted her freedom, or that they could have had a long engagement until she felt ready to get married.

The point is, Rory ultimately *didn't* feel ready to get married. Yeah, she said that in theory she'd say ""yes"" if Logan asked, but by the same token, I could say right now that I'd donate every cent to charity if I won the lottery tomorrow. 

Would I feel the same with the cheque in front of me? Probably not.

The objectivity of it doesn't matter. Hell, Lorelai was 48 (and even if you subscribe to the idea that ASP just recycled ideas she would have used for her own  like, seasons 7-10, would've been 38) before she was really, really, 100% in a place where she felt ready to take the plunge. 

In the revival, Rory is 32 and still not really outwardly especially interested in the idea of (or even emotionally mature enough for) marriage. Going back to Yale though...

Rory felt, in the moment, like marrying her college boyfriend would take away from the wide-open adult life she was only just starting to live.

Logan was just in a completely different place. He was 25, he already did plenty of wild oat-sowing, he had a clear idea of what his future looked like.

It was totally fair for him to feel hurt by her rejection of the proposal (though being all pissy about it after WASN'T so great of him), but it was also fair of her not to feel ready yet.",13,13,False,self,,,,,

Eventually Lorelai did come around when Rory and Jess officially started dating.

The Palladinos grew up in a world were the terms co-parenting or shared custody didnt even exist and maybe thats why its difficult for us to understand Chris behavior, for example?

I was rewatching The way we were the other day, which is one of the films mentioned several times in GG, one of Lorelais favorites, and in that film Barbara Streisand, when she breaks up with Robert Redford, even if they are married and shes pregnant, assumes that the kid is 100% her responsibility. She only asks him to stay until she gives birth. I think its implied that Redford also considers that the baby is only his responsibility as long as they stay together, not if they divorce. And when they see each other years later he asks her about their daughter with sadness and resignation, he doesnt even know her, has never seen her. Its like something that he has to accept because its not his choice. Thats completely inconceivable in our XXI centurys standards. I firmly believe that co parenting is not only about mens right, its also about womens right and about justice, about shared responsibility. But thats definitely not an issue in GG. Maybe thats why we have so many troubles understanding Chris? And Lorelais decision to raise Rory by herself? Maybe thats why in the Revival it seems like is only Rorys choice if shes a single mom or not? I dont know, just a thought.

**A Messenger, Nothing More** - Rory (Alexis Bledel) calls Lorelai (Lauren Graham) from Rome and admits that she made a mess of things with Dean (Jared Padalecki). Lorelai gives Dean a letter from Rory, but Dean's wife Lindsay (Arielle Kebbel) finds the letter and throws Dean out of the house. Rory returns from Europe, and a terrible scene ensues when she and Lorelai run into Lindsay and her mother (guest star Tawny Rene Hamilton) on the street. Meanwhile, Luke (Scott Patterson) returns to Stars Hollow after many weeks helping his injured sister (guest star Kathleen Wilhoite) on the Renaissance Fair circuit. Luke and Lorelai try to find a private spot to say hello, but are interrupted by a town parade.

Similarities: 

\- Manipulation: Emily manipulated Christopher to go to her ""wedding"" and try to win Lorelai back. Lorelai gave Dean advise behind Rory's back so that he'd be a better boyfriend thus weaning off Rory's fascination towards Jess. She also went to her grandparents when Rory took a break from Yale to make a plan on how to manipulate Rory back to school. 

\- Dislike of various boyfriends: Emily disapproves of Luke, and I guess a lot of Lorelai's other boyfriends as well. Lorelai dislikes all of Rory's boyfriends at various stages, and although she tries to get along with them eventually, her initial relationship with them is always awkward. 

\- Taking charge/control over daughter's dating: When Lorelai dates Jon, the guy she met at the auction, Emily wants her to keep dating him in order to keep her from falling out with his mother \(s03e5\). In the first season Lorelai invites Dean to their house and thus instigating their first date \(without Rory's approval\). 

\- Life choices: Emily strongly disapproves of Lorelai's choice to raise Rory on her own and not marrying Christopher. Lorelai seems equally invested in the idea of Rory going to an Ivy league school. First feeding her obsession with Harvard, getting angry with her parents for suggesting Yale, hanging up Yale paraphernalia at Rory's wall before her making the final decision and being angry with Rory for taking time off from school. 

Of course this is all simplified and there's a lot of dissimilarities as well: 

\- Lorelai and Rory normally have a near and friendly type of relationship. The strains between them seems like the exceptions rather than the rule, while for Emily and Lorelai the times when they have a close relationship is the exception. 

\- For the most time Lorelai seems more aware of Rory's needs and wants, thus making her attempts to manipulate or influence her life more successful and less invasive. 

\- Lorelai seems for the most time to have a better sense of knowing when to ""butt out"" than Emily, t.d. when Logan proposes to Rory and Lorelai is refusing her opinion wanting Rory to make up her mind on her own. Of course there's times when Emily also tries to do this, and times when Lorelai isn't, but there is a difference here. ",16,22,False,self,,,,,

 Luke and Emily opening up to each other in the hospital after Richards first heart attack, her telling him how she hadnt let Richard loosen his tie at the party and now she couldnt let go of it, and him telling her how he kept his fathers store just the way he kept it in after the latter died. Its such a humanizing moment for both of them.

 Lorelai and Emilys fight in Hammers and Veils when Lorelai is mad at Emily because of reacting unenthusiastically at the news of her impending marriage, and Emily turning on the tables by revealing that she already knew. Lauren and Kelly are both spectacular in that scene.

 Christopher and Lorelais confrontation at the end of Haunted Leg.

Wouldn't Lorelai have attended Chilton?

She grew up in the same house Emily &amp; Richard live in now (right?) and Chilton is the most prestigious school in the area, and very close to the house. Her parents are even friends with the headmaster!

Does this annoy anyone else, or have I missed something?

In some ways we see the characters at their peak, before the show did things that made me upset (Rory and the yacht, Aprils existence, etc). Lorelai is opening the inn, Lane moves out of her mom's house, and Rory and Paris adjust to college life. A few thoughts:

I thought it was a little weird for Rory to suddenly start dressing VERY preppy. I remember watching as a kid and thinking Is this how people dress in college? So many collared shirts! I do think the bob haircut was a good look for her though.

People hate the Jason relationship, but I actually found them super charming together. She doesnt date anyone else like him on the show, and their verbal sparring is really sharp and usually funny.

Paris treats Jamie like complete shit.

The last three episodes are some of my all-time favorite television, especially the development of Luke and Jess relationship.

I think Im convinced that Lorelai is more selfish and manipulative than Emily after the way she orchestrated that invitation to the test run.",19,50,False,self,,,,,

With that in mind I ranked every\*\* Gilmore Girls character with a blurb as to why they're ranked where they are. This list is going to be super controversial and I'm going to love if a significant amount of you disagree with me. Also yes I am a Straight 25 year old white male, this list clearly reflects that. 

1. Paris Gellar\- Starts off the show as Rorys nemesis, fantastic progression throughout the show. Cynicism is my favorite trait in television characters and Paris delivers her cynicism via quippy one liners and obscure pop culture references. 

2. Emily\- This should really be 1B since I love her as much as Paris, this is going to be unpopular since most people believe Emily could be a superficial spiteful bitch, to that I say who fucking cares?. Emily dialogue is why I fell in love with the show, especially when she would lose her composure \(usually this involved Trix\). I also believe Emily gets a bad rap because of her disdain for Lorelais life choices. Im willing to argue that her meanest actions were done with what she believed were good intentions. 

3. Mrs. Kim\- Mrs. Kims character arc may be the most redeeming aspect of a pretty shitty final season. Yes it sucked that she forbade Lane from doing literally anything fun, but she begins to let that go as the show progresses and ends up supporting Lane in her music and her marriage to Zach.

4. Michel\- Sassy French man \(check\), hates everybody in the world\(check\), loves dogs\(check\) Michel is a vain POS and I love him for it. His Celine Dion fetish is fantastic and if we were friends I would slip him 2&amp;#37; milk on the reg just for his reaction.

5. Sookie\- LOVE Melissa McCarthy, super glad they went away from the physical comedy that seems to be mandatory for any larger actress and just let Sookie be Sookie. Lorelai was lucky to have as good a friend as her, just too bad her husband was as irritating as he was. 

6. Lane\- Is it weird that I find the two main characters best friends a lot cooler than the actual main characters? Lanes completely unrealistic use of her floorboards aside the relationship she has with her mother is one of my favorite things about the show. 

7. Richard Gilmore\- the fashion icon of the show, just dont talk to him about Franz Ferdinand. The anchor of the Gilmore family, you knew Richard would always be there for you, just ask that asshole Strob. 

8. Luke\- Bearded Hermit who only wears flannel? Financially supports anyone who asks? Carves a Huppah for the woman he loves even though shes about to marry someone else? Luke is loyal to a fault and is way to good a Dad to have that annoying of a daughter.

9. Logan\- Yes I have douchey rich boy in my top 10 fucking fight me. Logan likes to rage and I can get behind that, whats he supposed to do, not spend the millions of dollars he has in his bank accounts? Lets be honest would you act differently if you had those types of resources at your disposal? Banging his sisters friends is a super bad look but the dude also had the balls to go out and make it on his own. Lorelai liked to blame him for anything that went wrong with Rory but whose idea was it to steal the damn boat?! My favorite Logan scene? Him telling Rory what the fuck is up when she makes fun of her fellow rich people at his party.

10. Kirk\- Willing to look past the major flaw of Kirk being a cat person since he ended up naming the cat after himself, I love the power move. That entire plot endeared Kirk to me permanently. The father son like bond him and Luke start to have in the later seasons was also a lot of fun. 

11. Miss Patty\- Gotta love the sex crazed off broadway star whose seen it all. Shes so glad she had all that sex, Lorelais glad shes covering her ass and lying to luke about drunken wedding speeches. 

12. Finn\- Finn is a boss and 70&amp;#37; of the reason hes ranked this high is because of his accent. His shameless pursuit of woman by using said accent and the fact that hes rich makes me really respect him. 

13. Mitchum\- was what he said to Rory all that wrong? The points he made to Richard in the bathroom of the USO fundraiser seem dead on. He wants his son to live up to his potential, that doesnt make him a bad guy. 

14. Lorelai\- Is a badass for making it on her own as a single mom without an education. Was constantly frustrated by her insistence to disassociate from her family. Her childhood couldnt have been that bad, shes not the first person in the world to grow up with an overbearing mother. I am also irked by her making things harder on her self. I understand wanting your independence but she was independent to the detriment of her kid, living in a shed with an infant just to be away from her mom doesnt seem like the best choice for a baby. 

15. Honor\- Another character I wish there wouldve been more of. Could see her turning into the cool mom that lets you drink in her basement in high school as long as you give her your keys. 

16. Madeline and Louise\- Seems appropriate to rank these girls together. These definitely seem like the chicks I wouldve gone after in high school and I definitely like that about them. Sex positive guy here and I know they wouldve appreciated that about me. 

17. Glenn\- Glenn parties fucking hard, single handedly carrying kegs up flights of stairs, going missing on spring break looking for a hot dog\(favorite food of mine\) and showing back up tatted. Love his dedication to having a good time while ironically never being able to actually have a good time. 

18. Colin\- went to boarding school in Switzerland so you know hes cool

19. Tana\- for being a kid genius she doesnt come off too annoying, wish she wouldve been around in later seasons. I found her tips on how to avoid losing valuable posessions when getting robbed super helpful. 

20. Janet\- I always hated the gilmores disdain towards sports, Janets just trying to stay fit. 

21. Lucy\- bad choice in men, worse choice in friends. She can do better than Marty and wet blanket Rory. Wasted her admission to Yale by getting a drama degree, but I love Kristen Ritter. 

22. Kyon\- Avril Levigne uh\-rocks! Just ask her

23. Tristin\- clich bad boy rich boy, summer is way cuter than Rory so I guess you can say hes not completely shallow. Im in the minority of not hating characters solely because theyre rich. 

24. Gil\- Sebastian Bach is a better actor than I ever wouldve thought. Tends to overshare about his wives nipple sensitivities. 

25. Brian\- Loyal friend of Zach and Lanes, bass player with a deviated septum and a knowledge of house plants. 

26. Gypsy\- enjoy the fact that traditionally male job like a mechanic is taken by Gypsy, not cool going through Andrews mail like that. 

27. Beau\- decent brother in law giving up his overtime to watch Sookie do her gross in home birth, would be higher but sexual harassment isnt cool. 

28. Rune\- wish he had more airtime, wouldve loved to see if him and Lorelai ever stood a chance

29. Max Madina\- Nerd, least favorite of Lorelais beaus.

30. Reverend Skinner\- busy watching movies that are too raunchy for a reverend. 

31. Robert\- not impressed with his costume choice during that Quentin Tarantino party

32. Doyle\- Outkicked his coverage with Paris and he knows it. 

33. Dave\- too much of a kiss ass for me, ditching his band to go to school not very rock and roll. 

34. Nicole\- cheating on Luke super not cool, making Luke put more salads on his menu? Unforgivable. 

35. Asher\- creepy old professor who fucks students, he didnt deserve Paris. Liked him better in Austin Powers.

36. Sherry\- again not around a long time, would hate her more if I didnt enjoy the karma her leaving provided Chris 

37. Shira\- I AM saying you gold digger, you aint mess with no broke berger. Cant be too mad at her self preservation, plus she wasnt in the show enough for me to gather that much passion behind my dislike for her. 

38. Taylor\- That guy that everyone hates because of how much he loves his rules. Defends facism because their parks were clean. 

39. Rory\- The other woman, the girl who quick school because someone said a mean thing to her, the girl who made fun of trust fund babies while literally being a trust fund baby. One of the reasons I like Logan is the same reason I dislike Rory, her startling lack of self awareness and the fact that things just randomly fall into her lap makes it very hard to root for her. Making my way through the Gilmore Guys podcast helped me come to this realization. I get so jacked every time I see her not get the NYT fellowship because not everything should be that fucking easy Rory. 

40. Jackson\- ways to get yourself hated, end your sentences while progressively getting louder, lying to your wife about getting a vasectomy. 

41. Caesar\- just always kind of annoyed me

42. Lindsay\- I do feel bad for Lindsay since she was cheated on but thats where the empathy ends. Having your husband blow off college and work two jobs cause you want your own townhouse WHILE not working at all is a bad look. That and the fact that she sucked as a stay at home wife makes me not like her. 

43. Babbette\- I wince every time I heard this woman talked. I get Sally Struthers is a TV legend but God damn babbette was annoying. 

44. Marty\- Martys aversion to rich people is matched by my aversion to his whiny ass. Marty is the epitome of the friend zone and proceeds to blame it on being poor. Guess the fuck what Marty? Jess owned 3 t shirts and worked at Wal Mart and Rory was still all about it. Maybe Logan isnt as bad as you think and Rory isnt into whiny guys who lie to their girlfriends about knowing their friends before hand. 

45. Gigi\- the shitty kid in target who goes batshit cause mom wont buy her a god damn toy.

46. Liz\- the mother of the shitstain that is Jess. What was Liz worse at, being a mom or cooking? Either way theres not much to like here, taking advantage of the nicest brother on the face of the Earth and trying to pawn her kid off on him any chance she can cause like being a mom is hard. Being a mom is hard when you produce the spawn of satan I guess.  

47. TJ\- FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK everything about this guy. The bottom of this list is really interchangeable\(besides april being last\). TJ is brought into the show to provide some sort of humor that never fucking delivers. His comedic timing is about as good as his ability to complete any sort of construction job. 

48. Zach\- My least favorite thing about Lane is that she settled for this moron, I guess its admirable he was willing to wait for the wedding night to fuck but his redeeming qualities stop there for me. This fucking headcase ruined his bands chances at a record deal because he refused to write a song about his long term girlfriend and got pissed that his friend was willing to the minimal fucking effort it took to at least try and write something for his friend Lane. The fact that he gets to tour while Lane has to take care of this dumbass kids blows. 

49. Jess\- Edgy New Yorker who wanted to take rorys virginity whether she wanted him to or not. They try to save his character in the later seasons by making him all artsy, people dont forget Jess. Lets ignore the glaring rape attempt and look at the fact that this guy treated the only person who cared about him like absolute trash, but hey he wore a leather jacket and liked books!

50. Dean\- whatsup fuckface adulterer? First to bone Rory, last in our hearts. If I see a person who liked Dean the most for Rory is a crazy person and I wont have it. Jess literally tried to rape Rory and I still hate Dean more.

51. Chris\- Hey dad who is only a dad when he feels like it! I know theres always going to be holes in character backstories but can someone explain to me why Chris just didnt live his life since he ended up not supporting Lorelai and Rory in any way shape or form. Lorelai didnt go to college cause she had a fucking infant to feed, Chris didnt go to college because who the fuck knows? Lets also bring up the fact that he forced Lorelai into a relationship and then ends it because he knew he rushed her into something she wasnt ready for. Not showing up to the hospital after your father in law has a heart attack because Lorelai helped Luke get partial custody is the ultimate dick move, fuck you Chris.

52. Anna Nardini\- Basically fuck any Nardini female. Any woman who decides to not tell the father of their child that hes a dad\(unless your obviously in an abusive relationship\) is a garbage person and I wont hear any of your weak ass justifications. Denying someones right to be a parent is a trash move and she tries to do it twice when she decides shes going to move to New Mexico.

53. April Nardini\- FUCK APRIL. I audibly groan every time I watch the series and she shows up the first time. The more science\-y Rory parallel falls so fucking flat and her quirks\(her dumb bike helmet\) didnt ever land. Who the fuck picks science camp over a trip up the east coast? April was the worst.

I know a lot of people like to put Rory into two categories: before Yale and after Yale, but honestly I think it would be more accurate to say before Logan and after Logan. My first time around watching Gilmore Girls I thought Lorelai and Paris blamed Logan too much for how Rory behaved, but now you can clearly see a turning point. He indirectly caused the down fall of Rory Gilmore. When she first met Logan her and Marty hated them and thought they were selfish and entitled, but not even a season later she was exactly like them. I always wonder if Rory would have turned out a better person in the end if she had never met him. 

In no way am I saying I hated Logan, I legitimately cried when she rejected his proposal the first time I watched it, but maybe a lot of the things we dislike about her in the revival would have been avoided.

I'm honestly baffled by what happened to the show, I did drag myself through season 6 but it was a depressing, joyless chore. I don't recall laughing even once during the whole season, just feeling really put off and alienated by the show.  
There were practically no scenes with the side characters, no town meetings, just no humor. The whole season was forcibly dramatic and serious, start to finish.  
Now I'm completely stuck on s7, it's atleast not the same tedious drama from 6, but all the humor and soul still seems gone. I'm around ep 6 and seeing no reason to care about where the plot or characters go from here.

**You Jump, I Jump, Jack** - Rory (Alexis Bledel) is impressed when Logan (Matt Czuchry) brings her to an elaborate event staged by his secret society, and she suddenly finds herself participating in a thrilling but dangerous stunt. Meanwhile, when Emily (Kelly Bishop) discovers that Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is dating Luke (Scott Patterson), she insists he come to dinner. Not to be outdone, Richard (Edward Herrmann) invites Luke to a game of golf, and Luke finds himself overwhelmed by the strength of the elder Gilmores' personalities.

Then when theyre in the car she tries to force a weird quirky quick stop to get some tacos from a random drive thru and when hes not into it (cause its gross Mexican fast food and he had a nice dinner planned) she then gets all pouty.

Two versions of everything at all times, including two versions of the characters and two versions of the story. 

This explains: 
*the scenes we heard about but never saw. Jess and Rory making fun of rich kids. Logan and Rory playing house at Marthas Vineyard. 
*the weird way time is treated. They have twice as much of it as the rest of us!
*character discrepancies -Rorys smart! No shes an idiot! Luke reads John Muir and Henry David Thoreau! No he doesnt read and cant name one author! Dean reads Tolstoy and stands his ground with Richard. No he watches Battlebots and needs Rory to defend him.  
*storyline discrepancies. Theres plenty but Ill list one: Rorys S6 job at the newspaper.  WTF? 
*continuity errors! Hundreds. Its a closet. Its a bathroom. Closet. Bathroom. Closet. Bathroom. 

How are the characters different in the alternate universe? This dialogue from S3E17 gives us a clue:

LORELAI: If the Poes start fighting, does that punch a hole in the space/time continuum?

RORY: And throw us into a universe where everything is the exact opposite of what it is here?

How can we tell which verse were in?

Book or movie? In general, the girls are in the real world when they mention literature or obscure cultural references, lalaland when they reference pop culture, movies or TV.

Lets talk about Rory. Rorys Yale interview: After watching 100s of hours of C-SPAN and Hillary Clinton the only role model she could think of was Gloria Estefan? Seriously? Does that make any sense? 

Other differences between the two Rorys? One is a voracious reader.  One isnt. S2E4 Rory at Harvard says shes read 300 books. At 16yo, 300 books is NOTHING! Nancy Drew alone is ~70 books! One Rory has pictures of female authors inside her Chilton locker while the other has pop culture cutouts. One can dance S1E6 while the other cant S2E8. One can hug -see Rory and Luke hug at the end of S3E22 while the other cant -see Rory hug the Gilmores a few minutes later. One is intelligent with a penchant for sardonic jokes while the other is silly, starry-eyed and tends to babble.

Oh, and the girly baby voice is used to depict lalaland Rory. AB used the girly voice increasingly as the show progressed because the portrayal was becoming more and more lalaland Rory, less real-world Rory. 

Trying to fan-wank a semblance of consistency to the characters is pointless because theres two versions of each character. If you find it impossible to reconcile a characters actions with past actions or opinions, its because youre comparing them to their alternate universe counterpart. 

Compare Richards reaction to Lorelais work techniques in S2E12 to his reaction in S2E20. Did her behavior differ that much in the two episodes? Why was Richard so appalled in S2E12 but impressed in S2E20? Watch. Think. Does it really seem like the same person? Each character has a yin version Ive got a new daddy Richard and a yang version Im suing Jason Richard. 

Seriously. As for storylines, consider this: 

How could Jess both ignore Rory and be an awful boyfriend while at the same time hes duding it with her every weekend -according to Lorelai? And theyre together nightly like a cute agoraphobic couple according to Lane? How do you reconcile those two vastly different realities occurring in the same universe? 

Answer: You dont. 

If youre doing a rewatch, try to open your mind up to the possibility that this could be true. Maybe some of the scenarios you previously regarded as WTF moments will suddenly make sense. Explore the idea that theres meaning behind all the references to alternate universes, other worlds, space-time continuums, multiple personalities, and my personal favorite mystic hammer.

**Emily Says Hello** - Rory (Alexis Bledel) decides that she and Lorelai (Lauren Graham) should split up at the next Friday night dinner and confront Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) individually about ending their separation. However, Emily dashes their hopes of a reconciliation by announcing that she is ready to begin dating. Meanwhile, Lorelai invites Christopher for lunch at the inn, unaware that Rory had warned Christopher to stay away from her mother. Feeling guilty that she hadn't told Luke (Scott Patterson) about seeing Christopher, Lorelai confesses that they had lunch, and Luke ""convinces"" himself that he isn't jealous.

Meanwhile, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) have their first fight when she accidentally upsets him by buying an old boat that had belonged to his father.

RICHARD: She lied to us. To you. To me.

RICHARD: The last time I checked, you didn't care for being lied to.

EMILY: Don't be condescending. I don't like being lied to.

RICHARD: [pointedly] We can't control what Lorelai will do. Rory won't go away. I'm doing what I have to do. [He returns to his reading, ending their conversation. Emily stands for a moment silently thinking, then leaves without a word.]

Looking at this moment from Emilys point of view, to me it seems he reminded her of the fact that he lied to her for so many years about his lunches with his ex and what he did with their money/houseso she was done trying to forget/ignore and move onhis response to her was the catalyst for the drama of season 5.

Their marriage starts to unravel from there because Emily was now going to do what she had to do relating to their marriage. 

That pause when she walks out of the room is her decision being made.

I started when I was 11 and now Im 25 and as I get older I notice different things and different things bother me, which leads me to this post. 

When the hell did Rory become so entitled? Im talking solely about her education here (although shes like this in most aspects of her fictional life). 

In the earlier seasons, she was obviously smart, but she still worked hard for everything she got. She was mostly modest and humble and it was like everyone was rooting for her to do well because she was the kind of person who deserved it. 

All of a sudden at Yale she has this giant 360 character change where she thinks just because shes Rory friggin Gilmore, everything should come easy to her; whether it was being able to manage a large course load or being able to sit under a very specific tree, etc. 

When she worked for Logans father and he told her she wasnt cut out for journalism, I feel like the old Rory would have obviously been upset, but would have worked her butt off to prove him wrong... not choose to discontinue her education (when she always loved learning) and throw a hissy fit. 

What made me write this post in the first place was that I just watched the episode where she returns to Yale and shes harassing this professor to let her into her already full class. RORY! Freakin A! The class is full. It went to kids who didnt act like a 2 year old the first time something didnt go their way. But no, because shes Rory Gilmore, she should be allowed to be in that class and act like a stalker freak and harass the professor. Like who does this???
