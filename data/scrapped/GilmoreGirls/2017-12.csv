She is never not emotionally entangled with someone, even when she's dating someone else. 

While dating Max, Lorelai consistently entertains the idea of dating Luke. She continues to go back to Max despite their obvious issues and breakups. In the mix is Christopher, who Lorelai is *clearly* in love with for the first 3 seasons. Their interactions are always intimate and often sexual, regardless of who either one of them are dating at the time. But no matter how close her and Christopher get, she still flirts and psuedo-dates Luke. When she dates Digger, she's again still entwined with Luke, who she moves to immediately after her breakup with Digger. While with Luke, she's still emotionally entertaining the idea of Christopher. But when she's with Christopher, she's entertaining the idea of being with Luke. 

You can see the same kind of behaviors in Rory with Dean/Jess, then Dean/Lindsey, then Paul/Rory/Logan/Odette 

I think a lot of this comes from ASP wanting everyone to love the Gilmore Girls. Every male in their lives is just so obsessed with them that they can't possibly be just friends. That's also what ends up relegating the male characters to plot devices 9 times out of 10. Their sole purpose is their ROMANTIC engagement with Lor/Rory. Maybe that's why it appears that Rory and Lorelai cannot draw appropriate boundaries for the male figures in their lives. Chris can't just be Rory's dad- he has to be Lorelai's lover. Luke can't just be a friend- he's her soulmate, even when she's otherwise involved. Rory can't just break up with Dean and date Jess, or let Jess be just a friend. She needs that attention from both. 

I also think R &amp; L can't commit romantically. No matter who it is or how right it is, they just can't do it. They're either casual, cheating, or self-sabotaging their relationships. Luke and Lorelai eventually become the exception, but it takes them 15 years. ",19,31,False,self,,,,,

Yes, Rory grows up with a single parent and for all of her childhood, they live a pretty basic lifestyle. But Lorelai being the amazing mother that she is, I doubt that Rory wanted for much. By example, Rory once tells a story about how she was made to accidentally drop cotton candy at a circus and Lorelai chases down a clown or something until they buy her a new one. Enter grandparents in the teen years. She gets to go to Chilton, she gets into three Ivy League schools, gets a brand new car at graduation, and has her college paid for in full. She is by definition, privileged. 

Fast forward to good ole season 4, episode 22, which bring us to this discussion. She sleeps with a married Dean (we all know the story), excitedly (?!?!?!) tells her mother about it, and then when Lorelai expresses disappointment in this decision, Rory runs out of the house and screams, ""you're ruining this for me!""

Rory is a spoiled brat who throws a fit the second things don't go her way - i.e. meltdowns at ""you need to lighten your class load"", the infamous Mitchum Huntzberger ""you're not good enough"" crack, and the revival ""this job is beneath me"" scenario - and I am not here for it.

Chris only did things for Rory when it made him look good to Lorelai. In the first season, when he came to visit Stars Hollow, he came there because he felt he was responsible enough to marry Lorelai. He tried to show her this by being around for Rory and attempting to by her books, etc. 

In the later seasons, when he has more money, and Gigi to take care of, he doesnt really put his children first. He leaves Gigi in the care of a nanny so that he can focus all of his attention on Lorelai. 
And even when he was renovating the girls house, we dont see a lot of things being fixed up for Gigis sake (a new room meaning new furniture and toys, etc.)

*This isn't you. ""This, you going out with this jerk, with the Porsche. We made fun of guys like this.""*

Jess's comment never made sense to me. Not only because we never *saw* such scenes of Rory and Jess hanging out making fun of anyone, much less guys with Porsches, but it also didn't sound like something Rory would even do. Or, at least, not something she'd do *comfortably.* She might feel pressured to half-heartedly agree with someone else's comment - someone she was trying to get along with -but I can't see how it could be genuine on her part. Rory's grandparents - who, for better or worse, she *loves* - drove Mercedes and Jaguars. Cost-wise, Mercedes cost less and are more common among middle class households, while Porsches and Jaguars, are more higher-priced  (For 2017, Jaguars actually start higher at $53k, while Porsches at $46k). [per truecar.com] 

So, while the comment is a bit of a head-scratcher canon-wise, what it does do is raise the issue of class and class distinctions and the question of *how did Jess feel about Rory's slightly rarified birthright position in society?*

On my latest rewatch, I noticed something that I hadn't fully taken in previously. 

Rory and Jess are arguing in her grandfather's study during S3, E14. It's when she's asking him to explain his black eye. The more he refuses to tell her, the more convinced she is he got into a fight with Dean. 

All that is besides the point, because the thing I want to discuss is this: Jess's eyes fall on the painting of Rory in Richard's study and he says:

**Now Ive seen it all.** 

It's a throw-away comment because of course the primary focus of the scene is the argument. But it made me wonder. Jess seems to smirk -it looks like a snide smirk to me - as he looks at the painting.  While he's in a temper because he's angry believing Rory is predisposed to trust Dean and not him, I'm not sure I would write off his comment as just being due to his in-the-moment anger. 

Has anyone else had ever wondered about Jess's reaction to the painting?",26,3,False,self,,,,,

She studied Child Psychology and Sociology in college so when we got into a discussion about Jess, she gave me a different perspective about Jess.  She said Jess or any teen who has been abandoned by one or both parents will develop anxiety, feelings of insecurity, feeling they have no value and are not worthy of love, depression, anger about their situation, self-depreciation, low self-esteem, and can be anti-social.  They have a hard time making friends or trusting adults because they are so afraid of getting close to someone only to be abandoned again. They also would rather abandon someone than go through the pain of being abandoned again if given the choice.  They sometimes will act out and test the boundaries of the remaining parent or foster parent because 1) they want attention/cry for help or 2) they are testing the remaining adult in their life to see if the person will stay no matter what they do or if that person will abandon them too.  They can also have trust issues.
I can see a lot of this in Jess.  He acts out when he steal Babette's garden gnome, the money from the bridge repair money from Taylor or whatever that was, and the baseballs.  He either is crying out for help or maybe he's testing Luke to see if Luke really cares and will not abandon him.  Of course Luke eventually kicks him out when he fails school but up until them Luke supported Jess and didn't care what the town thought about him.  Luke also provides structure and stability. Jess is also anti-social and probably does have low self-esteem.  He tells Luke that he treats Shane like dirt and she treats him like dirt too and that the girls he cares about don't care about him.  The chalk outline on the sidewalk prank might have just been something fun for him to do or could be another sign of him crying out and needing attention he didn't get from his parents.  I can also see where Jess has a hard time trusting people and the whole town hating him and wanting him gone does nothing to help him feel better about himself or heal from his abandonment issues.  
Lorelai's condescending attitude towards him, telling him she wishes she had a cream pie to throw in his face, and calling him a jerk feeds into his poor self esteem and feelings he has no value and is not worthy of love.  I was thinking about this and the accident episode and I think maybe one of the reasons Jess runs back to New York is he is afraid that the two people he cares about Luke and Rory will abandon him because of the accident so he leaves first instead of waiting for them to abandon him first.  
Jess probably also never had any stability with his mom when he did live with her, she probably let him run wild and do as he pleased because she was too busy with all her various boyfriends, drugs, and booze to pay any attention to her kid, and  I always wonder how all her boyfriends treated him. It was never said of anyone of them abused Jess but it is always possible.  I have always loved Jess and I think he was a complex and deeply troubled character with abandonment issues.  I love that we get to see him slowly heal from it and find both happiness and success in the later seasons.  ",111,60,False,self,,,,,

Luke cant let Lorelai into his life with April, either. Again, even when shes grown and the relationship is very different, April is very much Lukes kid, not Lorelais step daughter. He wont even let Lorelai help pay her tuition.

I know there is a lot of Rory hate here (tbh for other characters to) but I think the way she was portrayed in the revival was terrible and not true to the previous series. 

- Rory succeeded in everything she did. She may have taken time off, had some setbacks etc. but I refuse to believe that someone with a first class degree from Yale, a great educational background and tons of experience in journo (I mean the Obama campaign trail?) would fail to get a job in journalism? The industry is difficult, yes, but her personal links and obvious talent wouldve gotten her somewhere. The series couldve focused on her struggling to make it big or feeling in a rut, but having her as as - lets face it - a straight up wash out doesnt seem true to form 

- Lorelai and Luke at the fertility clinic? They wouldve either had or decided to not have kids by this point. It wouldve been a more interesting plot point. I think the wrong Gilmore was pregnant at the end. 

- The build up of Logan as Rorys Christopher. Originally I thought this full circle idea was interesting and exciting. Logan can be, for lack of better word, a massive dick. However, his character is obviously more nuanced and driven than Christophers was ever shown to be. Christophers extended absence from Rorys life does not appear to be something Logan would do and it seems unfair that two seasons of relationship is then cast aside.

But then in some scenes where we've seen Lulu with Kirk, the character often feels totally different and almost as if they've dumbed her down to make it appear that she's kooky or a little different in the same sort of way that Kirk is. 

I'm probably not explaining this right but does anyone else ever feel that Lulu is represented differently at times? I really like her character so I always felt a bit underwhelmed by her whenever we see her and Kirk together.

I try to see Chris good qualities but I just dont get what people like about him. I dont think his chemistry with Lorelai is all that great, they act more like close cousins than anything. Hes impulsive and has no emotional regulation and is very demanding of Lorelai and Rory throughout the series.

A big thorn in my side was always the plot with Lorelai and Christopher getting married in Paris. I always thought it was so dumb, rushed, made no sense, and that it didnt make any sense for Lorelai to do it. I had similar feelings about Rory and Deans season 4/5 affair.

Upon rewatches though, my tune has changed. Dont get me wrong - I hate both of those plots still. I dont think they were executed well at all, especially with season 7 not having the right voice and the characters just in general being off due to the Palladinos exit. But the more I think about the motivations behind the characters, I think it makes total sense that Lorelai rushed into marrying Christopher.

She never got over Luke - she ran away from him after giving him an ultimatum about marrying her. She bolted immediately when he wouldnt answer, but if he had said yes she wouldve been ready to go marry him that same night. Obviously she acted impulsively running to Christopher, and regrets it the next morning. But ultimately, what she needed so desperately was for Luke to want her enough to put their issues aside and just go for it. She wanted to marry him so badly. Her ultimatum was so desperate. Luke was the safest, most comfortable relationship she ever had. He was the one. But he couldnt answer her right then and give her what she needed.

So I think it was only natural that as soon as someone came along, someone she had history with and who she knew loved her to death, she jumped in with him because she was so desperate for that with Luke. Luke couldnt give her that immediate gratification that Chris was giving her. Obviously it wasnt right, and she didnt love Chris, but I can totally see why she blocked all that out and agreed. Here was a man who it was supposed to be right with, offering her all of the things she couldnt get from Luke.

And Christopher knew Lorelai wasnt in love with him - but he was always desperate for her so he ignored it because finally they could be together.

I hate Christopher, and I think they shouldve ended things sooner in S7 and spent more care on building Luke and Lorelai back up, but I feel like that plot was totally in line with her character at that time. Even if I didnt agree with what they were doing - but hey, there has to be drama and conflict on a TV show.

Same with Rory and Dean - her losing her virginity to a married Dean was always my most hated plot, but after rewatching multiple times, it was clear that was what her whole season 4 arc was leading to. Falling back into something comfortable after having a scary year full of transition and change. Of course cheating with and on people is consistent with her character throughout the show as well. Shes proven to be a possessive, impulsive character when it comes to love (and I say that as someone whose favorite character is Rory).

I think this is where Luke is quietly very endearing to me. One of Lorelai's quirks is how sentimental she is about her stuff. She loves her house and her car for instance. Luke gave up on the Twickam house because Lorelai loved living in her own house, and he paid for the remodeling himself and helped with the work. When Lorelai wanted to keep her jeep, he went out and found an identical jeep so she could harvest the engine and keep her own jeep. When they were in bed talking about kids Luke basically said any amount would be okay.

Chris ended up getting angry and jealous. And about her not wanting the wedding party or wanting to have a baby right away.

I know some people think of Lorelai as selfish, but I never interpreted it that way. I think part of it is sentimentality, some emotional baggage and also her buying a house and car was entwined with her building her own identity and independence. It's a bit like her keeping her name as Lorelai Gilmore after she got married. She likes to keep the things that define her.

I think Luke got that. And that he was so willing to accommodate her and let her have her quirks is very sweet and watching S7 I find myself really annoyed with Christopher being so angry at Lorelai and just not getting her and who she is.",6,20,False,self,,,,,

I genuinely want to know why a majority of people (here) likes Jess. 

He had to grow up without a father and I guess this is why people give him slack for all bad things he does. Rory had a pretty much same situation but she turned into a decent person. At least to some extent. People often say ""everyone hated him that is why he..."". Hate or dislike doesn't come just like that. From the first moment he stepped to Stars Hollow he caused trouble. Also, people don't respond well to a cynical and condescending way of talking to them. He painted that picture, nobody else was to blame but him. He had a chance to be a nice guy, start from scratch, but he chose to be a city jerk. By doing this, and going against Luke's help he made his life more complicated, but I guess he finds self-pity fun. That way he can always think of himself as a victim and that world is against him.

What I find the worst is the fact he constantly lied to Rory, and she stomped and crushed Dean for that schmuck. That silly girl obviously has fallen for ""tough outside but complex from the inside"" act, a pretentious girl like Rory didn't have a chance with resisting it. I am sure he was aware he is not a reliable person, but he dragged her from a decent and lovely boy and then he just left her, without a word. I mean, she totally deserved that, karma is a bitch, but still if you love someone you don't do that. That is just plain selfish and mean.

How do you people explain this? He was smug and condescending when Lindsay told them about the music she likes. You have to be really ignorant to laugh at other people music taste so you can belittle them. Who does that? Also, when Luke told him a Dean is already fixing a fence and setting up a reimbursement plan, he told that Dean is going to be a great doormat to some women in future. What the actual f***?

Share your ideas on how you would have liked the characters and plots to have gone, what story lines you would have liked them to explore, finish or start.

So the following is my version Season 7. It's main theme is growth, independence and self-discovery. Some of you may disagree on some of my points but that's okay, let us know what you would do differently!


**Lane:**
After Lane and Zach gets married, Hep Alien lands a record deal and makes it semi big. Not super star status, but more like big on the indie scene. Lane and Zach do NOT have kids. Brian either gets a girlfriend or ironically becomes the chick magnet and gets all the groupies. 

While on their national tour, they run into Dave and his band. Because Dave and Lane never really had any closure, there is a moment when Lane is tempted as they both still feel a spark between each other. She does not cheat, but it jostles her, makes her start rethinking the marriage. In the real season seven, we see that she hates having sex with Zach and it is never really clear if she ends up liking it or not. So I'm going to carry that through because it is actually a lot more common than people think. Lane and Zach appear to be happy on the outside but are both miserable with their sex life and they're simply not in love anymore. Overwhelmed by the dissatisfaction with where her life was going, she confronts Zach and they decide to get divorced and she walks away from the band. She moves to New York City to start a new life (more on her life in NYC in my last paragraph, the ending of the season).

**Rory:**
First off, I was never a fan of Logan, so I would have Logan break up with Rory the night before he leaves to London...and they stay broken up. No more Logan. 

The morning after Logan leaves, Lorelai pulls up in her Jeep and they go for a road trip (this is explained more in Lorelai's section). Unlike their road trip after the Max situation, they don't talk, they let the music drown out the silence. Rory is not fussing with maps, she doesn't care that they're driving aimlessly. She sits there, emotionally numb, watching the scenery go by. As the sun is setting, they find themselves ironically at the Cheshire Cat again. Too late to turn around, they reluctantly go in for the night. The same woman is there, her over-the-top cheerfulness is in stark contrast to Rory and Lorelai's grimness. The cat is still on the steps too. They are brought to the same room as before. As they enter the room, still not saying anything, they both lay down for the night. In the morning, they sip their coffee and nibble on some donuts.  Lorelai breaks the silence and says that she and Luke broke up, Rory says she and Logan broke up. They talk about their situations and they each have their own epiphanies. 

Rory realizes that she needs to be on her own, not only to heal from a broken heart, but also to find herself. Because for the entire season six Rory lost herself, season seven would be about her finding herself without the help of a boyfriend. 

For the entire season she stays single, not a moping, sad single...but a strong, no bullshit, focused on herself single. She learns how to stand on her own financially, emotionally and mentally. She rediscovers her love for writing and, while working as the Yale Daily News editor, she starts to dabble in novel writing. She networks on her own, without the influence of Logan's family, and after graduation she is offered an entry level job as a journalist for the New York Times. More on that in my last paragraph.   

**Lorelai and Luke:**
Instead of heading straight to Chris after giving Luke the ultimatum, I would have her go on one of her road trips. That's what she does to clear her head. She drives to Yale, picks up distraught Rory and they drive, both dealing with their own broken hearts in silence. As mentioned above, they find themselves at the Cheshire Cat . The next morning, as they talk over coffee, Lorelai came to the sobering realization of her role in the dissolution of, not only her relationship with Luke, but with every relationship. In order for any relationship to work in the future, she had to work on herself. 

Once she gets back to Stars Hollow, Luke tries to fix the situation like he does in the actual season seven, but Lorelai holds her own. She refuses Luke's proposal calmly, she sits him down and explains exactly what she had been going through with the whole April thing, him distancing himself and not letting her in and how that severed the relationship. Luke, dumbfounded, sits there taking it all in. At this moment, he actually starts to cry because he is finally understanding how much he hurt her. Shocked by his sudden breakdown, Lorelai is torn, she wants to comfort and hold him but she's still too hurt to even touch him. So she just sits there awkwardly as he cries. As the emotions calms down, Luke again tries to get her back. Lorelai says that she doesn't want it to be over, she loves him but she cannot continue the way it was. If he wants her in his life, he needs to figure out how to let her in. 

As the season progresses, we see their relationship on the mend. They sit down with Anna, April's mother, and explain that things need to be different. The have a family dinner.....Luke, Lorelai, Rory, April and Anna...so everyone can get to know and trust each other. Lorelai and April create a stepmother bond, April and Rory start to get to know each other better. Maybe Lorelai and Anna eventually become friends (they're both quirky, so why not?). 

It would also be a fun little nod to the theme of having one person playing multiple roles in the show by having Jess show up in an episode and remark how similar Anna looks like his dad's girlfriend. (she played both characters).

**Sookie:**
She does NOT get pregnant again. Instead, she furthers her career by writing her own cookbook. Throughout the season she uses her friends as taste testers for her new creations for her book, some really good creations and others really, really bad which would keep her in the comedic relief part she usually plays.  

**Paris:**
I actually wouldn't change Paris' storyline. I like her and Doyle's growth, I like that she decided to go to medical school and Doyle would go wherever she ended up.

**Richard and Emily:**
I wouldn't really change anything. I like most of their story lines. 


**End Of The Season:**
I would end the season with Luke and Lorelai getting married in small yet fun ceremony in Stars Hollow. Rory would accept an entry level job offer as a journalist for the New York Times due to her own hard work and networking. She moves in with Lane in NYC because, come on, it's New York....rent is crazy expensive and Rory refuses to live off her grandparent's riches. As she works at the Times, Rory starts writing a book on the side (possibly Gilmore Girls like in the revival). Lane realizes that there is a lot she still needs to do and experience due to her repressed childhood, so she starts working as a radio DJ and experiments as a solo musician, she dates around and generally enjoys life on her terms. This is a risky move, I know, but I would have Lane explore her sexuality by dating women as well. Since she did not enjoy sex with Zach, she needs to find out if it was just sex with Zach or sex with men she didn't enjoy. 

I would want a scene towards the end with Lane singing in a coffee shop (she branches out from being just a drummer), Rory drinking coffee and writing while Lane sings in the background. Someone approaches from behind her and startles her with some quippy line (I can't think of one). She turns around to see Jess standing there with a grin. The scene fades out as you see Rory and Jess hug and they start to reconnect. 

The very last scene of season seven would be Rory and Lorelai, at Lukes.....no surprise there. But the last words would NOT be ""Mom, I'm pregnant"". Instead, maybe have them be  ""Rory, I'm pregnant."" which lets us know that Lorelai and Luke will be starting a family of their own. Or strike that and have the last words be ""Oy, with the poodles already!"".

The end!

It all started in S5 with their weird party in the woods. What is so great about being born into white privilege, learning the best way to swipe bottles of alcohol that your parents bought, and speaking without using the letter e?

I also don't understand why Rory is so fascinated by them. By S5, she had a great relationship with Richard and Emily, she saw the life that she could have had - but she's never seemed to have wanted it before.

I hate Finn. How obnoxious, entitled, annoying, selfish, sexist can a person be? Pretty much the same for Colin and Robert, although the two seem a bit more wordly (especially Robert).

I also hold a great deal of resentment toward them for how much time they took up in the revival with their awful, absolutely vomit inducing storylines, particularily the Baz Luhrmann-y dancing on the roof and the tango club.

EDIT: I apologized if it came across as another bashing character thread! This is not meant as a criticism, but rather as a way to get better insight into their personalities and understand where they come from &amp; the source of their problems.

**Lorelai**

She's very stubborn and reluctant to change her ways. She ""fancies herself Wonder Woman"" (3x01), even though she is emotionally stunted to a degree, and has a tendency to use Christopher, Rory's father and a link to her old life, as someone she can self-sabotage for and fall back on when things get rough.

**Rory**

She's inherited Lorelai's ""commitment"" issues (the whole Dean vs Jess thing is a pretty clear sign of her indecision). She can come off as entitled, selfish and spoiled especially in later seasons. A straight-A student and people-pleaser who is perceived to be incapable of doing any wrong, it's almost like she's overcompensating for the circumstances of her birth sometimes, imo. 

Feel free to disagree, though!

First off, I did read the criticisms of the revival and I agree with the majority of them. This is a write-up of the bits I did agree with.

As someone who re-watches the series at least once a year (usually while knitting, as I don't have to watch to know what's going on - it's more a radio show for me at this point hah), I did not watch any of it for nearly 10 months after AYITL. The revival did the job of tying up loose ends for me, and I was satisfied and content in that respect.

So on to the Girls:

**Emily**

I honestly did not realize it was the actor who play Gypsy who was Berta. And I thought that her speaking a language nobody understood was a beautiful metaphor - Emily, who has such a hard time listening and *understanding* others, suddenly has someone who understands her perfectly, but whom Emily can't *mis*understand. Emily finally got an extended family to look after her and to look after, and I just felt she was genuinely happy at the end (makes me cry thinking about it. I'm such a softy).

**Lorelai**

I think the revival more than any episode in the OS showed us how Lorelai has a hard concrete wall inside her, hiding her innermost feelings, thoughts and personality. She always comes across as so open, sharing, understanding and talkative, but she never really, truly opens up to anyone. Which I think is one reason why Lorelai and Emily could never quite understand each other. Emily is too deaf and Lorelai is too closed up.  
The first time she willingly and lovingly opens up is on the hilltop telling her mother a beautiful memory of her father and it was the crowning moment of the revival. Then I knew she was going to be alright.

**Rory**

Rewatching the OS again now it strikes me that Rory really has no ambition or drive. None. All good things that come to her just falls in her lap, with the possible exception of getting the job at the Stanford Eagle. But even that job came about because she was offered the internship in the first place.  
She studies because she likes learning, but almost everything else? She becomes editor of the Daily because they can't agree on anyone else. She gets to be on the Obama campaign trail because the original reporter couldn't do it.

As for Rory in the revival we have to remember that as far as ASP is concerned, S7 never happened. Logan never left his dad's company and he certainly never proposed. She never even got that campaign job, and even if she did write for that website, it could well have folded in the 2008 financial crisis.

With no drive and a tanking job market, I find it entirely believable that she had to move home.

And as for the last four words - well. We know she's a good writer, that was true from the start. I like the idea of her writing a novel, even though that particular title was all too *""Little Women""/""Little House on the Prarie""* -esque.  
She was never really a city person, and working at the local paper and writing a book - I can see that.

Everyone in her life always said they expected great things from her and sure, that possibly could have happened to the Rory that did go on the campaign trail with Obama and got a card from Christiane Amanpour, but not the Rory we left in S6. Or at least a lot less likely.

Anyway, that's my $3.50.",22,27,False,self,,,,,

Since the ending to AYITL was supposed to be the original ending if ASP got her own I remember reading in an article a quote from ASP saying that she probably would have Rory go to Oxford to do her master's. This means by the end of season 7 she would be heading to get her master's or if there was a season 8 got her master's. If there was a season 8 then she would have originally gotten pregnant already having her master's at that point.

What things have you noticed in the original GG that they probably wouldnt get away with if the show aired today?

One that always bugs me is the breastfeeding woman in the diner that Luke gets pissed at (absolutely unacceptable nowadays). 

Texting and driving/talking on cell phones and driving. 

Oooh, Lorelai at Sherrys baby shower and being horrified that Sherry was using green for a girl isnt it supposed to be pink, pink for a girl? 

And, of course, all kinds of casual racism, homophobia, body shaming, transphobia, sexism, classism, and general xenophobia (clearly ASP hasnt learned anything going by AYITL). ",61,5,False,self,,,,,

What are we supposed to get about each character? And the relationships attached? Am I just over thinking this similar (yet very different) action by our two protagonists?

And yes I know there have been recent posts on Luke's dark day but I don't think what I'm looking for fits into them because it's also about Rory. Just like I'm sure there are some recent Rory stealing the Yacht posts or at least inner post conversations about it. But this isn't just about Rory. 

This is in my head now based on a recent Tumblr post.

Can we just talk for a minute about how WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE the family therapist was in AYITL??? 

I'm training to be a therapist, and my jaw was on the floor every time she was on screen! She was so judgemental and so clueless and obviously unable to maintain a professional demeanour considering she tells Lorelai she's had to take smoking back up again! Completely unhelpful, and then she massively violates confidentiality agreements (and could have been sued and lost her licence) by going to Lorelai's town to audition for the play L mentioned and then greeting her and massively self-disclosing personal information to her client! 

And look - the problems between Lorelai and Emily were not that crazy, difficult, or unusual. I think that a therapist who was not a mushroom disguised as a person could have helped them make massive progress within ten sessions. All of their problems boil down to a lack of communication and an unwillingness to examine their relationship honestly; this is hardly the most uniquely difficult relationship between a mother and a daughter that it would take a team of PhDs with 500 years of practice between them to unravel. 

I think this is the most egregious example of ASP's habit of telling instead of showing, and I don't know what the hell kind of therapists the Palladinos have gone to, but they probably ought to have reported them to the licensing board. I kind of think that either the Palladinos are totally lost about how therapy works, or they realised that Lorelai and Emily's problems *could* actually be solved with relative ease in therapy but they couldn't deal with the de-escalation within the plot. 

And it's such a shame, because I think there could have been some beautiful healing and communication within a therapy session, or coming out of one.",25,52,False,self,,,,,

During her birthday party April even told Lorelai she reminded her of her mom.

Was there some point ASP was trying to make here?  She could have made Anna someone completely different than Lorelai.  I'd say she was trying to show Luke had a ""type"", but then there was Nicole who doesn't seem to fit that.    I always wondered about this.",33,12,False,self,,,,,
