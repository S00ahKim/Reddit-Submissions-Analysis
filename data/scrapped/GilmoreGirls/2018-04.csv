Please don't continue reading if you haven't watched season 6+7 - sorry, I couldn't find the 'spoiler' tick anywhere. 

I wanted to point out some weird aspects I see in Rory and Logan's relationship. I've already read a lot of you team Logan's well-written points in his favor, but as I rewatch season 6 now (for the millionth time), I'm still really frustrated in a lot of things. Also, as of late season 4 I was not a fan of Rory at all, so none of my frustrations are aimed toward Logan alone. Please bear with me, I'm just expressing my own opinion here.
 
1. Up until S06E08, Rory doesn't seem bothered at all with Logan's (fairly) heavy drinking. Doesn't she mind that he turns to drinking so much? Yes, I get that he is dealing with some issues, but as his girlfriend, shouldn't she at least talk to him about self-medicating like that? It seems a lot more serious than just ""drinking and partying"", as Logan puts it. Rory just ignoring this doesn't come out realistic enough in my eyes at this point in their relationship. 

2. Also, even though Logan tells Rory about his dad's plans for his future at the beginning of season 6, they never actually discuss their meaning up until later in the season, when they are forced to address them. They just fight a little because she picked up some of Logan's bad habits (i.e. drinking and partying), and Logan expresses his discontent about the path he's been required to follow. They never, up until at that point, actually sit down and talk about Logan's possible future plans versus his family's expectations. Rory isn't pushing any conversation about it, nor is Logan. I don't know, with Rory supposedly being so passionate about her own professional path, it should have raised some questions about those of her partner, shouldn't it? She did have some (albeit minor) conversations about it with her past boyfriends. It's like she doesn't want to bring up anything serious to Logan, unless they are fighting. Like she's lost all of her self-confidence by dating him. I don't know...

2. I'm uncomfortable seeing them in bed together, I don't know why! I swear I was less fazed by seeing her and Dean in bed together (and I'm not a fan of him at all). Her bringing Logan a glass of water, wearing nothing but his giant shirt, then see them hinting to talking ""blue"" or whatever... it's not making me laugh or be like ""awww"" or anything (it's not supposed to be romantic, right?). I just cringe really hard. Plus I'm not a fan of shaved male chests, but that is just me...

3. After Rory says ""I love you"" for the first time and Logan replies awkwardly, neither one seems shaken in any way. They just continue doing their thing as usual, whatever it was. Logan isn't bothered, Rory isn't bothered... it's just weird. I get that Logan doesn't want to recognize he may be in love with her, but it's still strange to know Rory would keep dating someone who may be OK with having a girlfriend he's not sure he loves. What gives? I know I would be having trouble just continuing hanging around like that. And I get that she may put up with it because she's madly in love with him, but nothing thus far has indicated to either one of them feeling more than excitement at dating each other. Plus her confession was not romantic at all. 

I can probably find more things that I find bothering in their strange relationship as it unfolds in season 6, I just thought I'd bring up some. I know it's part of the supposed romantic relationship complexity of a more mature Rory, but it rings all the wrong bells to me. Again, all of your previous points in Logan's favor are solid in my eyes. I just wonder if any of you find it weird too. Of course by season 7, though, all the weirdness is cleared so we can head rapidly towards Logan's proposal. What a shame.",21,19,False,spoiler,,,,,

It's funny seeing Rory waltz around campus, being the only one whose wardrobe was carefully picked out by a stylist on each episode (mostly through seasons 5-7), while all the extras in the background are sporting their boring jeans and t-shirts combos. Makes sense, given that the extras were probably told to dress like normal college kids and brought their own clothes. The result is that the extras actually look like normal college kids, while Rory looks out of place with her shiny bangs and impeccable fashion-forward (enough for 2005-ish) clothing choices. How does she have the time to get ready in the morning? (yes, I do realize it's a TV show!).

Even though I like most of the clothes she's wearing through seasons 4-7, I thought her wardrobe pre-college reflected her introverted character better, and also better suited the environment she was in. 

On another note, the show's ""outer"" Yale set makes me claustrophobic. I'm talking about the outside halls set mostly (the one that is getting ""sunlight"", you could say). I feel like I know its route by heart. I know it was filmed indoors, on stage sets, but I think they could have done a better job and maybe extend the set a little bit. For example, I really like the grandparents' garden. It was also filmed indoors, but it gives off a more airy vibe, in my opinion. 

This is nitpicky, I know, but I really wanted to see more of the college aesthetic and set design, I guess. I was Rory's age at the time it was on, and I was really excited about the college atmosphere and vibe. ",41,60,False,self,,,,,

Mine are:

 I liked season 4 way more than season 3. I think Season 3 while having some brilliant episodes (They Shoot Gilmores, Dont They?, A Deep Fried Korea Thanksgiving, The Big One) just dragged out in some parts. I also disliked the aimlessness of Lorelais character arc - at least right up until A Tale of Poes and Fire - and felt that there were a little too many filler episodes for my taste. And dont get me wrong, Season 4 has its share of filler episodes as well, but I liked how they were mostly set against the backdrop of Lorelai and Rory adjusting - and floundering - to the big transitions of their life. Lorelais Dragonfly arc, in particular, is a big highlight for me.

 Speaking of which, I loved Jason. I understand where people are coming from that his physical chemistry with Lorelai was lacking, but I felt that they had some great banter and fun together. I liked that they established his character outside of Lorelai, and that there were some great thematic parallels between them - their childhood ties and their shared disconnection from their parents and desire to break away from them - while also setting up some fundamental differences between the two that indicate why they didnt work out. 

 I loved the tone of Season 1. I get what people mean that the show didnt really pick up until season 2, but there was some great characterization and more grounded storylines back in the beginning - something which the later seasons were lacking.

I feel like Rorys entitlement is supposed to be intentional. ASP has mentioned several times that she wanted the show to come full circle. Its so interesting to me that Lorelai ran from her parents home so that she could raise Rory to be independent and always taught her that wealth and privilege were bad, yet as soon as she possibly could, Rory runs to that type of lifestyle and is obviously drawn to it. Because Lorelai tried so hard to avoid smothering Rory like her own mother did, and yet it turned out exactly the same way  with a kid who is super independent to the point of stubbornness and a lot of conflict between mother/daughter.",12,5,False,self,,,,,

Part of the reason for even creating Rory was that at that time there werent any young girls on TV who werent just talking about boys or trying to be popular. Girls fell into two camps: There were either popular girls or the angry girls wearing Dr. Martens and dyeing their hair black who really wanted to be popular. No one was talking about school or books or life interests or looking at the world in any sort of different manner. Part of the reason to make Rory who she was was that we wanted to make a teenager who was into the other parts of life and who was comfortable in her own skin. She didnt feel the need to be part of a big, popular cliqueshe had Lane, she had her mom, she was cool. She wasnt fucking around at 13 years old; she wasnt blowing guys in a bathroom at a party. A lot of people told me they went to Yale because of Rory, and that they read certain books because of Rory. So I think people took a very critical eye whenever Rory made a mistake. But the bottom line is: People make mistakes; people are human beings. 

https://www.vogue.com/article/amy-sherman-palladino-gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life


So my thoughts. Amy created a virgin, studious and perfect teenager Rory Gilmore not to make a moral statement, but quite the opposite, because someone like Rory was a transgressor in the context of American TV in the 90s. It was a feminist statement, not a moral one. But a lot of the fans loved Rory the good bookish girl and when she changes after season 4 and becomes more real and less clich (people are human beings, people make mistakes), that part of the audience felt betrayed, specially after she looses her virginity to married Dean. College Rory wasnt there to be a feminist statement anymore (they have already done that), so the Palladinos wanted to add more layers to her character, make her more interesting, less perfect and maybe they over-corrected her a little bit or a lot, Im not sure. And maybe thats why Rory gets all this hate while other female characters in TV series with more flaws (more selfish, more promiscuous etc) arent judged so strongly. 

Of course everyone can think whatever they want about a TV character, I totally respect all opinions, but I honestly dont see how shes entitled or a brat (I have learnt the meaning of this word in English because I read it so many times here related to Rory that I finally search it in Wordreference). Shes such a hard worker in Chilton and in Yale, she accepts money just for her education, shes nice and considered with her mom most of the time even at 16 or 17 years old... There are things about her that I dont like, of course, and moments that I will change, but I think overall shes a nice girl, a little bit insecure, who had to mature very young because thats what daughters of teenage mothers do, who doesnt have the best track record with boyfriends, who chooses a very difficult profession in the worst possible moment, who wants to be independent and free and make it on her own in stead of choosing the easiest path. And that includes the Revival. I give her a lot of credit for that. If my dad was a nice and charming millionaire who felt guilty about not being there for me and wanted to throw money at me, would I still be struggling with my job and living in a crappy place? I honestly dont think so. Rory does and shes still a brat. I dont get it.

She has a really critical taste in movies and TV, and she always had these remarks while she was around the living room and the show was on (as my family had just one TV set back then). Of course I also videotaped it and watched everything multiple times, so she analyzed my fave show from various angles all the time.  

Back then I was annoyed, but today I love reflecting on her views. I get most of her points even if I don't agree. Some I can agree with. Back then, all I thought of doing was yelling, ""it's my fave show and relax, it's just TV! It doesn't have to be a masterpiece"". We had a mother-daughter banter there, for sure. 

Anyway, I thought I'd share my mother's views on the show with you, just for fun:

- My mother thought the show was super unrealistic (well DUH), so most of the time she hated it. Very critical, as I said.
- She hated the fast talking and said it gave her a headache (what? how!!).
- She said the script made all the characters sound the same, and that it seems the writers just wanted to display their wittiness by making all the characters throw those snarky sentences in the air (can be argued).
- She thought Alexis was a good actress (I agree).
- She thought Lauren was not a good actress (I disagree).
- Also, she thought Lorelai was a bad mother (can be argued).
- Emily was way too harsh and controlling in her opinion (yes).
- But she still thought that both grandparents were great actors (yes!)
- She LOVED the episode in season 1, where Chris first shows up and all the Gilmores meet for FDD. I remembered she called it ""a great dramatic family moment"" (I agree!).
- But she hated the end, when Chris proposes to Lorelai, due to it being, again, unrealistic and childish on both of them (I loved that scene!).
- She found Rory too self-confident for a teenager, and Lorelai too childish for a grown woman (on retrospect, I agree).
- She felt sorry for Paris, because she said it was wasted potential for this character. She thought Paris' text and story arcs were too exaggerated and turned her into nothing but comic relief (I can agree to some point).
- She felt really sorry for Lane for having to hide her life (Yes!) 
- She thought that Luke and Lorelai had excellent chemistry, and that their characters fitted perfectly well as a couple (YES!).
- She asked me if I agree that Rory became a snob from the moment she started Yale (I said yes, and sadly I still agree).
- Except for Richard and Luke, she found the guys on the show boring and bland and lacking in story. She said they are all just underdeveloped stereotypes and plot devices, not real characters, and called it lazy writing (NO!).
- She said that Lorelai seems to share every little aspect of her life with her daughter, and that it is unhealthy, yet Rory hides too much from her mother, which is also unhealthy (I can agree). 
- She didn't like them eating junk food all the time (I love it, mom! Me and my mom are both vegetarians, so I only liked the basic notion of burgers and meaty stuff as a form of junk food. I'm more of a fries and onion rings girl myself).

These are some of the points made by my mother - I find them all really interesting, as they are the opinions of someone who generally didn't like my favorite TV show, yet was eager to share their (then unwanted) insight on it.",14,43,False,self,,,,,

And, as an extension, I'm kinda glad it didn't get picked up for a series.

Not only do I think Jess wouldn't have been a strong lead for a show (just Jess as a character, I think Milo is a fantastic actor), but I feel if he had this fantastic life and bond with his father, it would've cheapened the character of Liz. I feel like maybe they were trying to emulate the success of 'Angel' by having the broody love interest as a new lead, but I just don't think a Jess spin off would have gone to any drastic new heights or anything.

I could be wrong, and I guess we'll never know, but I am curious to hear your thoughts. Did you know it was a backdoor pilot at first, and do you think they could've made a decent show out of it?

Forget ASP and her statement about Lauren and Alexis, and how it was ""fate"" that they both had brown hair and blue eyes. Like obviously ASP has those features, and almost all her leading ladies share them (Miriam Maisel from MMM and Anna Nardini as Lorelai's rival). It's not hard to find two women that share hair and eye color.

Lorelai and Richard both have those long faces and slightly hooded (idk if that's the right term, but they're very unique looking) blue eyes. And Rory and Christopher have the same shade of hair, eye shape, face shape, skin tone, everything really. Like I don't think Emily and Lorelai or Lorelai and Rory look alike, but the girls look a lot like their fathers. 

Overall, I think it was a great casting desicion. In a lot of shows, the ""families"" don't look like they could be related at all. In MMM, Miriam has pale skin and blue eyes, and her parents both have brown eyes and darker skin in comparison to her.

For example, I am #teamLogan, but I dont think Rory had to marry him at the end of OS or that she has to be with him ever, and I dont feel angry at her for it, but I saw several people who like her with Logan clearly hating her for not choosing him or being with him, either at the end of the OS or at the end of the Revival. And I also saw #teamJess hating her because she didnt choose him and even saying that he (who disrespected her in season 3 when ignored her obvious discomfort and her requests to wait and then blamed her with that long-handled excuse of abusers ""it was you who came here"" and then again in season 6, when he just appeared to play in her face that she wasnt that way and that he knew her better than anyone even though they barely got together and when they stayed, barely talked about anything but books) is better than her, it's too good for her. And even #teamDean people, who blame her for his abusive attitude (when he said he loved her and she didnt said it back, or all the times he broke up with her in public, for exemple).

I know some people hate her for other reasons, that I also think is unfair, because she is a human being and shes not perfect and I doubt that the people who hate her and are so judgmental about her mistakes are perfect, so it sounds really hypocrite. But hate her because she didnt choose your favorite guy for her, is sexist and you totally miss the Gilmore Girls point. (hating ASP because of her choices for Rory, that has to do with guys, isnt fair either and again, you miss the point).

Gilmore Girls is a series about two (three?) Real women who are not perfect and make mistakes, so, be angry with Rory because she didnt choose the guy you thought was best for her, to insinuate that she is not deserving of a guy who was horrible to her just because she made mistakes in life or that she deserved to be treated like crap for an boyfriend whatever the reason is, it's not cool, it's sexist.

Rewatching this I get so chocked at how much progress weve made so far. I know we are not perfect as a society in general but I do feel like the younger generations are more open about mental health issues, and the whole pride thing about ""my daughter doesn't need a shrink"" just doesn't sound modern anymore. I mean your daughter has a crisis, dropped out of school and stole a boat, got arrrested, did hundreds of hours of community service, etc. I mean the least you could do is make sure shes getting all the help she needs and one appointment at the psychologist is not that bad of an idea.

63,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2018-4-10,2018,4,10,9,8b3gnw,self.GilmoreGirls,Dean is Psychotic,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/8b3gnw/dean_is_psychotic/,blowsnose,1523320357,"I know the argument over which of Rory's boyfriends is best for her has been done to death here. And I know many of you have come to the conclusion that Dean is the worst of all of her boyfriends. I have always been team Jess, but I'm not here to argue that right now. I'm currently on my annual rewatch of the show and this time I find myself not just annoyed with Dean, but absolutely appalled by his antics. The guy is psychotic. Allow me to explain:

1. When we first are introduced to Dean he tells Rory he has been watching her. This comes off as innocent, as if it was an innocent crush and that he was maybe just not ready to ask her out. But when he does finally get the balls to talk with her, he isn't shy or scared to, he is confident. He is in fact so confident that it often leaves Rory flustered. He doesn't even ask her out for a few episodes and instead pops up randomly, like following her on the bus. He's so charming that I cant help but see it as sociopathic behavior. Sociopaths are often prepossessing and can manipulate what they want out of people by acting so charming. 

2. The whole Donna Reed episode where he admits he wants a submissive wife who will do his cooking and cleaning for him. This is more neckbeardy than anything else, but it has always bothered me that the issue was never really resolved. Rory dressed up as Donna Reed and Dean throws out some half assed apology while still insisting he likes his women in the home. We kind of get to see this later on with Lindsay - it's implied that he doesn't want her to work and that he will provide for them. That is a little nutty for such a young couple with absolutely no savings. 

3. The first time he says ""I love you"" and she doesn't reciprocate and he loses his shit and breaks up with her is pretty nutty. I understand him being upset, but to totally cut it off is extreme. He loved her and yet when she was unsure how to respond and he doesn't get what he wants he flips out and leaves her. It's emotionally abusive and I'm always frustrated that Rory blamed herself for it.

4. His obsessive behavior whenever Rory has to interact with Tristan. Tristan is a dick, I won't deny that, but for the most part Dean had no reason to not trust Rory around Tristan. Yes they kissed when she and Dean were broken up, but Tristan isn't not part of the show for much longer after that interaction. Before the break up, she is nothing but wonderful to Dean and had showed him time and and time again that she thought nothing of Tristan and that she knew he was a huge jerkwad. Dean still flips out any time the kid is around. When Rory is in the shakespeare play, he is so incredibly possessive of Rory that he can't even allow her to practice their school play in peace without looming in the background like her own personal bodyguard. 


5. His obsessive behavior when Jess moves to town. Yes, Rory did eventually develop feelings for Jess, but Dean did his fair share of pushing her away. He calls her constantly and she does all she can to try and ease his mind. She spends time with him, calls him daily, answers his pages, meets him before and after school. She is the perfect girlfriend and he again is emotionally abusive and makes her feel guilty for him feeling all butt hurt and not spending every waking moment with him. He even gets mad when she is doing homework. This in turn makes her like him less and want to ignore his phone calls. And the most infuriating part of this time is that he claims to be such a 'nice guy.' He's such a nice guy that he calls her 100 times a day, he's such a nice guy that he flips out at her in front of the whole town and breaks up with her at the dance marathon. He's such a nice guy that he makes her cry anytime he feels hurt or upset and blames it all on Rory. 

6. I'm going to make this my last point, even though there are many more to be pointed out. When Rory and Jess do begin dating, we see the true dark side of Dean. He threatens Jess. He befriends Rory, not to actually be friends with her, but to mock Jess. At the winter carnival he admits as much when Jess and Dean talk while waiting for Clara to come out of the bathroom. Jess tells Dean he knows what he's doing and Dean admits to it all. Jess: You really think that by being her friend your going to get her back? Dean: Me and Rory are friends, just like you and Rory were just friends - and look how good that turned out  This is the most psychotic of all of his behavior! He is emotionally manipulating Rory so that he can win her back. And it doesn't even seem he wants her back because he loves her, he acts like he wants her back as a prize and so he can stand over Jess and say ""see, I won, I got her, she's mine"" It's sick and poor Jess gets all the flack for this. He is blamed every time a fight erupts. Sure, Jess puts off those bad boy vibes, but when you really look at it, he was defending Rory from this crazy person. (This not to say he didn't have issues of his own especially when it came to his relationship with Rory, but thats for a different post)


TL;DR Dean is manipulative, deceitful, emotionally chaotic, obsessive, and possessive. He is played up to be such a ""nice guy"" but when looked at from a different angle, is really a devil in disguise. ",65,141,False,self,,,,,

Rory always had a very eventful love life. However, up until season 4 I always viewed her as someone who will not prioritize romantic relationships over her studies and her personal well-being. She could point out the problematic aspects of her earlier love drama, even when she didn't vocalize them, and was able to break free from them emotionally (I'm mostly referring to Jess). 

I was disappointed to see Rory dragged into an emotional affair with a married Dean, and later accepting Logan's terms of casual dating. Yes, the latter relationship at first made her unhappy so she made an effort to change it. And yes, she did write that letter to Dean. 

However, I still feel like the Rory we knew from seasons 1-3 would have just ended these relationships, viewing them as somewhat toxic. Lorelai certainly seemed to see them as such, when she talked to Rory about the Dean situation and later about Logan. 

Instead, Rory chose to dive even more deeply into both relationships. Her affair with Dean made her become the other woman. And her infatuation with Logan I feel pushed her to do un-Rory-like things: mingling with the ""in"", rich crowd she always stayed away from at Chilton; wanting to please Logan's father really badly at the internship, etc.

**A Family Matter** - Luke (Scott Patterson) is wary when his ditzy sister Liz (guest star Kathleen Wilhoite, ""ER"") shows up for an unexpected visit. Lorelai (Lauren Graham) promises Jason (Chris Eigeman) that she will tell her parents about their relationship, but changes her mind after Emily (Kelly Bishop) jokes about how laughable it would be if Lorelai and Jason began dating. When Paris (Liza Weil) confesses to Rory (Alexis Bledel) that her affair with the professor is becoming serious, Rory reminds her how badly she is treating her boyfriend Jamie (guest star Brandan Barash), so Paris breaks up with him. Finally, Luke discovers Jess' car is missing and reports it stolen, but discovers that Jess has come back to town to pick up the car. Rory comes upon Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) sleeping in his car but walks away without speaking to him.

Lane is the supportive cheerleader to almost everything Rory does (her reaction upon learning of Rorys affair with Dean comes to mind, for instance). Whereas Paris, to put it shortly, is not. 

In a way, its a bit similar to Lorelais friendships with Sookie (the Lane in this scenario) who is the sweet, warm friend whos reflexively supportive and admiring of her - and with Luke.

Hear me out. Luke and Paris are more alike in the sense that they both challenge Lorelai and Rory (respectively), are more outwardly critical of them mostly because they want whats best for them and while often acting annoyed with them, are fiercely protective of and would do anything for them. Theres also the fact that Luke and Paris are shown to have few (if any) friends besides them, and take a long time to open up to other people in general, so their friendships with Lorelai and Rory have even more value and meaning to them.",17,101,False,self,,,,,

Much as Season 3 was Rorys season, Season 4 is Lorelais, in every sense of the word. Shes given a lot of range to work with - the heart of which is dealing with her daughter/best friend going to college and how that affects her own life, too. The seeds were planted all the way back to Cinnamons Wake (1x05).

BABETTE: I guess eventually you have to move on. Figure out what your life is going to be when you're not busy taking care of somebody else. 

Restoring the Dragonfly is pretty representative of her journey this season. Forced out her comfort zone last season after the Independence (a place she considered her home) burned down, she takes upon the task of opening her own inn, tackling her share of obstacles in the process (Chicken or Beef?, The Incredibly Sinking Lorelais). Other important storylines include her relationship with Richards business partner, Jason Stiles - Chris Eigeman was born to play the role, and their back and forth banter is a delight to watch - as well as her deepening friendship with Luke. As far as the will they/wont they years go, I dont think that they are ever as close as they are this season. Then theres also the storyline with Emily and Richards separation, which ties into her character very nicely. Theres just something so thematically compelling in how the fulfillment of her longtime professional dream - a milestone in her adult life - happens right when her parents - the biggest connection to her childhood - separate. 

Rorys story is... well, its not as special, but thats kind of the point. Years of being the town darling in Stars Hollow leave her utterly unprepared for the real world, and her experience in Yale highlights that. I feel for her this season. She has been used as a vessel for others dreams for her for so long that shes left reeling when she fails to meet expectations. While I do think a part of her is still hung up on Jess, hes just not right for her in this stage of her life. She craves for a stability he cannot offer. Her storyline with Dean is a total spin on that, though, and it explains her decision in the finale. She misses the comfort and safety of their relationship after a long year of scary change - and she acts on that.

Emilys storyline is fantastic. Kelly Bishop really shines here. Emilys characterization receives a nuance I had not seen since season 1 as her increasing feelings of neglect and displacement on Richards part lead her to evaluating her own life in the process, serving as the catalyst for some amazing character moments (An Affair to Remember, Scene in a Mall, The Reigning Lorelai). The decision to have her and Richard separate was a bold one - and it made sense, creatively speaking.",6,19,False,self,,,,,

I think it can be dangerous and a disservice to those who have truly experienced abuse or rape to call Jess either of those things and we should be careful how we use either of these terms.  Jess was a troubled kid with abandonment issues who had never seen what a healthy, good relationship looked like.  That's why we see him instead of calling Rory and making plans, he just shows up with Distiller concert tickets.  He shows he cares with his actions similar to Luke but we see those actions a little less with Jess because he is terrified of being abandoned again and has his guard up a lot of the time.  He keeps people at arms length,  If he doesn't let people close to him, they can't abandon him.  He's cool with him doing his thing, Rory doing her thing at the Carnival and then meeting up later.  He ruined that guy's snowman for Rory so she would win the contest.  He didn't get mad that she was hanging out with Dean again, he only asked that she be the one to tell him if she went somewhere with Dean instead of finding out from someone else.  Nowhere in the show does Jess ever hit her or call her names or act in any way abusive towards her.  I have heard people say that Jess isolates her from her family but nowhere on the show does Jess actually do this.  The whole time they are dating, Rory still sees her mom, her friends, and she even has Thanksgiving dinner with her mom, Luke, and Jess.  Yes, he gets frustrated with her when she badgers him at Emily and Richard's house but he doesn't abuse her in anyway.  He asks her if they can discuss this after the dinner but she keeps hammering at him about it.  They argue in Richard's office but that is also no way abuse.  The whole time they are together leading up to Kyle's room, Jess never rapes or try to rape Rory.  In fact, all they do is kiss and he doesn't ever push for more.  He's cool with just making out.  In Kyle's bedroom, Jess is in a bad head space having just found he's flunking out of school and knowing this probably means Luke is going to abandon him (kick him out) and he goes up to Kyle's room to be alone.  Rory comes and finds him and can tell that he is upset about something but he doesn't want to talk about it.  They kiss and are making out, he reaches for her belt, and she says wait but keeps kissing him and then when she says no again, he stops.  He's thrown for a loop,  confused, probably a little embarrassed, and as he's terrified of abandonment, her rejection cuts deep so he doesn't handle it very well but he doesn't abuse or rape her or even attempt to rape her.  He is not abusive and he is not a rapist or attempted rapist.  Jess has his flaws, he's pulled harmless pranks, and yes he's gotten into at least one fight that we see with Chuck Presby although we don't know exactly what the fight was about other than Chuck being a jerk.  He keeps a wall up to protect himself, he's moody, and he's sarcastic but he is not abusive nor is he a rapist. ",88,17,False,self,,,,,

It's because I felt like there was no point to it at all. They have a good time, sure, but what else is happening there? I've been racking my brain, and I can only answer this with ""nothing"". 

I get the metaphor that by being together, they are shielding each other from adult life and major commitments that are knocking on their door. I get that they are both kind of stuck at this point in their life. But it's not enough for me and I'm not convinced anymore. It doesn't keep me interested, and I can't root for them nor do I find them likable. 

They are both back at the same point in their relationship that they already were at season 5  casually seeing each other. What else is new? 

There is no character development or some great revelation at the base of their current relationship. It's not like Logan helps Rory see the light or find her path. 

There is no great love, either  they just hang out or have sex, but it doesn't really seem all that passionate. It's just, well, casual. 

I cannot find a purpose behind this. They are boring. They are repetitive. They eat. They have sex. They evoke no emotion within me besides boredom and annoyance. I get that a lot of people like Logan and wanted to see more of him. But why was it necessary for us to see them together again, hanging around aimlessly, and for such a great portion of the revival? 

Was it because we needed to see that they would not end up together - again? Was it for the sake of showing Jess vs. Logan - again? Was it for the sake of Rory and Chris having that talk? Was it only because of the last four words that needed to be said? 

I'm sorry, but for all of these reasons, it could have been done differently, and a lot way better. I just don't get it. ",44,12,False,spoiler,,,,,

**Nag Hammadi Is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels** - Stuck in Stars Hollow while his car is being repaired, Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) keeps running into Rory (Alexis Bledel), but he walks away from her every time they meet. Luke tries to talk to Jess about Liz's (guest star Kathleen Wilhoite) new boyfriend T.J. (guest star Michael DeLuise), but Jess angrily tells Luke to stop interfering in everyone's life. When Lorelai (Lauren Graham) does Emily (Kelly Bishop) a favor by attending a charity dinner, she is pleasantly surprised when Jason (Chris Eigeman) also shows up and Emily asks them to pretend they are a couple. Finally, when Rory and Jess run into each other for the third time, Rory tries to be the one to walk away, but Jess stops her and makes a shocking confession.

I really enjoy the sense of adventure (to quote Lorelai on roadtrips) these scenes give off. Maybe it's because when I was originally watching the show I was Rory's age and would dream of travelling and exploring the world.

I like the Harvard trip best, which is fitting because it was the first trip taken on the show; I LOVED the 'Wild' plot - I know I'm a minority on this one, but for me it was one of the few enjoyable moments in the revival; I loved Luke's camping trip on season 5, even though he didn't love it as much, and even though we only saw a second of it; I liked seeing Rory and Emily in Italy; I loved when Rory rode to New York to see Jess; I liked the beginning of season 3 with the Washington D.C. scenes; loved Lorelai and Max in New York as well...

I can probably name a lot more small ""travel"" plots like these which I absolutely love.

Lorelai: ENFP. No doubt about it. Her lightening wit and non-stop jumping around from idea to idea screams Ne. She's also bubbly, optimistic, and fiercely individualistic. 

Rory: ISFJ. She's sweet but reserved, an eternal pacifist, and has a strong work ethic.

Richard: ISTJ

Paris: ENTJ. Again, no doubt about it. She's very ambitious, incredibly goal-oriented, and has strong leadership qualities, to put it mildly.  

Logan: ENTP. He's charming, witty, spontaneous, and a risk-taker.

Richard and Emily aren't angels, but even Lorelai thought Rory's actions were unjustifiably cold:

S6, Ep. 13: ""Friday Night's Alright for Fighting""

LORELAI: I just got a call from your grandfather. 

RORY: [looking a little mad] Oh, yeah?

LORELAI: He called to tell me Yale returned his check. He thinks it's a clerical error.

RORY: Huh.

LORELAI: Not a clerical error.

RORY: Nope.

LORELAI: They're gonna find out, kid.

RORY: Yep.

LORELAI: Getting charged by the word on you calling plan?

RORY: What do you want me to say?

LORELAI: How about ""what do you think we should do?""

RORY: Nothing.

LORELAI: Rory, they're going to find out that Christopher is paying for Yale.

RORY: I know.

LORELAI: And they're not gonna like it. It's gonna go over badly. It's gonna be the opening night of ""taboo"" all over again.

RORY: They had to find out eventually, mom.

LORELAI: Yes, but shouldn't they find out from you, not some office clerk at Yale?

RORY: What's the worst that can happen? We won't be speaking anymore? Gee, that would suck.

LORELAI: Wow. Ice, ice, baby.

RORY: Sorry, not trying to be cold, but I don't think I should feel guilty because I want my father to pay for college.

LORELAI: No, you shouldn't, but my parents do have feelings. You saw my mom when the gardener butchered her box hedges.

RORY: Okay, fine. I'll send them an e-mail. 

LORELAI: Okay, fine, but you could also call and tell them yourself. It'll probably only cost you 75, maybe 80 words.


In the end, both of the Lorelais have a nasty habit of reaching out to Richard and Emily only when they need something, which is why Emily is often forced to use money as a bargaining chip. Thoughts? ",70,98,False,self,,,,,

In it, she talks about how Luke was like a father figure to Rory \(or something to that affect\) and really helped out in raising her. 

Luke does a fuck ton for Lorelai and loves Rory dearly. That's not the argument. But I don't think Rory would ever consider him a father figure and I think if you compare what he does for Rory to what a  lot of other people do for Rory, he would come up ""short."" \(He wasn't obligated to do ANYTHING for Rory, so everything he does is super sweet and nice. Again, I'm not arguing that he's not good to her or that he doesn't 'do enough'\) 

I think Lorelai's pseudo co\-parent was actually... Sookie. We actually see Sookie do a lot of the same things Luke does for Rory \(making her birthday cake, feeding her, coming to her school events, etc\) but it's never framed the same way. The show makes a big emotional hoopla out of everything Luke does for Rory, but it's never that way for what Sookie does for her. 

We also see Sookie make sacrifices for Rory, like happily giving up her concert tickets so Rory could make friends, offering to ""sell her car"" for tuition, baking for Rory's bakesale, etc. Like I said, she goes to Rory's events and is actually super involved in Rory's school stuff in general. She takes the crazy pictures at graduation like a proud mom. And I don't think it's a stretch to say that she probably watched Rory a lot when Rory was growing up, too, or even just spent time with her when Lorelai was busy. 

It's just an interesting thought I had. Sookie gets the short end of the stick so often and I think this is another example of that. ",49,177,False,self,,,,,

It's been a while, so I've had to do some quick Wikipedia revision and apologise if I'm wrong about any plot points.        

So originally after they get engaged, Lorelai doesn't want to get married until after she has fixed things with Rory. Then after Rory comes back, Luke doesn't want to get married until after things have settled with April.       

It's weird because quite a few characters seem to be a bit iffy about those things, and imply its because they're not actually ready to commit to each other. Then that pressure seems to be eventually what makes Lorelai give Luke an ultimatum and then drives her into the arms of Christopher.            

At the time I remember sort of agreeing with those other characters - there is this thing of 'Hey, if you want to get married - get married! If you're putting it off the reason is that you're not really ready for the commitment/don't really want to be together/finding excuses/not communicating. If you really wanted to be married you'd be chomping at the bit to get down the aisle.'      
Because especially at the time it seemed like.... if you really want to be together, you'd just do it, not let other stuff get in the way.     

But now I'm a bit older and I find myself in a similar situation. My partner hasn't found out he had a secret daughter that he hasn't told me about for two months (to my knowledge.... I have to agree Luke keeping that from Lorelai was really bad relationship form, however thrown he was, and she had right to be shocked/pissed off).             
But I've been engaged for a while now and it always felt like we were 'putting off' organising the wedding. I kind of blamed it on my hatred for/fear of organising things generally (which..... definitely a factor). And it did make me think 'Wait WHY am I being like this? Do I subconsciously not want to get married to him?', not at all helped by the fact that people around me always like to make comments on it. ""When is the wedding? Are you going to actually do that or what?"".         
I had a think, and we had a talk, and we realised that the reason we have both been 'putting it off' is to do with us not being in a good place *ourselves* recently, not to do with each other. Just for life reasons (employment, having to rethink some career stuff, financial, housing uncertainty, and subsequently related mental health impact - for both of us at the same time, which has been really really hard and obviously put some strain on things), both of us are finding it really hard to feel positive about the future right now, even if we believe deep down that things will get better. Because weddings are supposed to be all about celebrating having a future together, and even if you're really certain about the 'together' part of that, I don't want my (hopefully, only) wedding day to be all about putting a brave face on about a life that seems bleak right now. On TV/in films, being in love is the be all and end all that is supposed to be enough to make you deliriously happy all on it's own, but real life doesn't work like that.         
Now we're on the same page so agreed to focus on making a few steps towards having a more positive trajectory, and then we can start thinking about the wedding.              


It's not that I wanted to tell you all my life story (sorry about that), but I was wondering your feelings on that whole plotline and particularly the other character's input on them? Because this whole thing got me wondering about how Lorelai was acting around the time she gave Luke the ultimatum, and maybe I'm projecting - but one reading of it was that she was trying to understand how she felt in terms of what she thought she was *supposed* to feel, and the pressures of that on the relationship, rather than the relationship itself.           

Were you watching them thinking 'Just get married goddamnit!' or 'Well this is clearly all just excuses about not really wanting to get married', 'loving each other should be enough to feel like celebrating it' ? Or do you see what I mean in that that ultimatum and subsequent break-up could be a culmination of a long line of other factors - that actually had nothing to do with loving each other - and if they'd just communicated those more effectively rather than worrying about what they were supposed to do or others thought, things could have been different?

Don't get me wrong, it's a good piece of writing and it definitely brought tears to my eyes the first time I ever watched the show, but in no way was this a good valedictorian speech. Valedictorian speeches are suppose to be endearing.  They are suppose to be about the students, past memories, stories, and the future. This speech did nothing of that nature. I think the speech started off really well when she was talking about all the ""characters"" at Chilton that she's had adventures with. But I think that when she started to specifically mention her family members, how much they meant to her, and about how her mother was her hero...I think it sounded more like a ""Who are your personal heroes"" essay...not an endearing valedictorian speech.

Its probably been discussed a hundred times but I just wanted to get others opinion on it. 

I know that everyone wants Rory to find her Luke (and I know that a lot of people consider it to be Jess), but have people considered that she has to go through her Chris phase first? 

Lorelai had to see that nothing, absolutely nothing, was going to make it work between her and Chris before she got back with Luke. She had multiple relationships, she was engaged twice, and she ended up going back to Chris every time because she wanted it to work so bad. It took their marriage failing for them to realize that no matter how much they may have cared for each other, a romantic relationship just wasnt in the cards for them.

I think the most Chris-like relationship of Rorys is obviously Logan. Shes still hung up on him, what, nine years after she turned down his proposal. She showed no romantic interest in Jess and Dean is married (even though that didnt stop him before I like to think hes doing better now), and she even seemed to be considering keeping Logan out of her childs life, ala Lorelai. I think that she and Logan have to go in cycles where they keep trying and then it doesnt work out before she could possibly find her Luke. 

Or, they could go the Emily and Richard route, Emily stealing Richard from his fianc and them living a very fulfilling and happy life together for like 5 decades.",9,4,False,self,,,,,

For a while, I liked the way that Lorelai parented. I admit Im young (20) so it was appealing to think that my mom could be my best friend before she was my mother. But honestly, as I watched more and more seasons, I realized that it was.... counterproductive.... for lack of a better word. What I mean by that is, Lorelai wanted so bad to know be a mother like Emily (who she thought was manipulative, controlling, and cold-hearted) that she went the completely other way and she and Rory had no boundaries with each other. But boundaries are good. I think that kids need boundaries, because Rory and Lorelai have this odd codependency thing, especially on Lorelais end. But one thing that Rory and Lorelai do have that I do think is good is their communication. They seem to be the only person that the other can communicate with, and even then theres highs and lows. 

Then you have Emily and Lorelai. The most complex relationship in the whole show to me. They love each other, the audience knows that, but the characters dont seem to always believe it. And they both make efforts, but theres usually an ulterior motive and once that ulterior motive is discovered, everything goes to hell. And its a cycle that just continues. Their communication is so bad, and I do blame Emily (and Richard) just because they are the parents. Clearly their communication stems from her childhood and once youre an adult its very hard to change something like that. Lorelai learned her communication from her parents, almost as a survival method. As a teen, (from what we know) she knew they wouldnt allow her to do the things she wanted, so she simply stopped asking and would sneak out. She knew they would react badly to the things she told them, so she simply stopped telling them to protect herself. At some point, she knew that doing something for them meant that there was some sort of deal attached to it, so she simply stopped doing things for them. 

At the same time, to maintain a relationship, Emily also evolved her techniques, mostly in the form of money. Paying for Chilton meant Friday Night Dinners, the loan for the Independence Inn meant meetings there and ultimately being apart of Lorelais whole world and not just the Gilmore world. You can really tell that Emily wants to be close to her daughter and really cannot understand why theyre not, but when Lorelai tries to explain it to her, she disregards it.

Emily and Rory is a smaller dynamic that I dont know if a lot of people have analyzed. I think that to an extent, Emily (and Richard) see Rory as their second chance, and I believe that even Lorelai has alluded to this several times in regards to Yale. It helps that Rory likes that world, being rich, going to the galas, dressing up, she likes that. Lorelai never wanted it but Rory takes to it like a duck takes to water and im sure Emily recognizes that. But while Rory sees her grandma and loves her, she also sees the other side, Lorelais side. Shes a medium between them two in that she cant fix their problems (not even a therapist could do that lol) but she understands where theyre coming from. But I do think that its interesting that Rory was closer to Richard, and wonder if its because Emily was always the villain in her mothers stories. ",11,35,False,self,,,,,

Just that moment at the end where he says Welcome home Mrs. Hayden ...it just blew my mind that we are expected and urged to believe that these are the same characters that the show begin with.
Even when I first saw the episode all I could think was.. no. Like I understand that Lorelai is going through something WILD emotionally, I understand that this episode in particular definitely tries to lean the audience toward liking Christopher (the stories from when they were young together are sprinkled throughout the episode making it seem all too nostalgic and romantic) however... no.
The original Lorelai would never have gotten married to anybody without Rory there, I believe. And this episode just seemed to derail everything to me, she had pushed Chris to the side for 20+ years then the second Luke and her break up she ups and marries him?
For some reason this is just getting me very mad thinking about it so Im not really explaining myself well here but my point is - after Amy Sherman-Palladino left, looking at the series, you can definitely see a change in the story line.

User /u/imperfectcharacter asked me why I found the theory absurd, as indeed I do, and I thought I might as well make a thread about the subject.

There's a few reasons for which I think the whole idea is nonsense.

* The show was Amy's baby. Multiple cast and crew members have commented on how committed she was to the show and its universe. Even aside from that, it was clearly the show that was establishing her legacy, and it would be ridiculous for her to deliberately sabotage it. This theory suggests that she was willing to not only ruin her dear creation, but also risk her reputation and future prospects. Stubborn as she seems, I do not believe she would do that.

* The Palladinos only left the show in late April 2006. That was the very end of the filming cycle; I've read that the only episode left to film at that point was the season finale. Yes, negotiations started before then, but all with the goal of trying to *stay* in the show. Why would she write deliberately bad storytelling if there was a chance she'd be the one continuing it? 

* Amy explained the April storyline in [an interview at the time](http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/02/theyre_slippin_.html), and gave fair reasoning for why she felt it was a good direction to take. I totally agree that it didn't quite work, and the ""secret child"" angle could have been approached in a much better way, but you can understand where she's coming from and she clearly put thought into the idea. As for Lorelai going to Christopher: that's a logical step to take at that point in the story. It's infuriating but this sort of thing happens in TV dramas all the time. TV shows need conflict, and I've always found it a really juicy cliffhanger. It doesn't mean she was ripping L&amp;L apart - her plan was always to get them back together and married. So, if she didn't believe they were bad stories, there's no way she could have been on a sabotage.

(The Palladinos address these three points themselves [here](http://www.tvguide.com/news/team-palladino-interview-8523/), in a great interview.)

* Amy and Dan wrote the revival, without any reason to intentionally ""ruin"" it, yet many fans (myself included) believe they did. But whether you like the revival or not, it definitely showed that ASP had no problem making the lead characters unhappy and unsuccessful at key areas of their lives. The more troubling sides of Lorelai and Rory that we started to see in S6 were clearly a part of the wider story - for better or worse - that Amy wanted to tell. So why would we assume that S6 was her being bitter, rather than her just making decisions that many fans didn't agree with? She's done that again since, hasn't she?

I'd really like to stop seeing this theory flung around. What do you think? Do my comments make sense? If you still believe there was something malicious going on, why?

So we know that Rory and Paul have been dating for approximately two years when the revival starts. I was wondering how/why Rory even dated him in the first place, since she doesn't seem to like him or care for him very much, and it occurred to me that maybe she only initially liked Paul because he seemed like a sweet, benign, well-meaning guy. 

Rory was 32 in the Revival, which means she had probably just turned 30 when she met/started dating Paul. So here we have Rory, who is still unsettled in her career, has only had one major article come out, and is perhaps feeling very unsure of herself/her self-worth as she enters her third decade. Meeting Paul, who obviously adored her, probably made her feel quite good about herself, which is why I think she let him stick around and dated him. 

But why keep stringing him on for so long? Probably because sometime after she'd started dating Paul, Logan came back into the picture, and she started boning him (out of nostalgia, or what have you). Logan was probably engaged (or close to it, and at least dating Odette) at that point and Rory knew Lorelai wouldn't approve/understand her going back to Logan after all this time, so she kept Paul around as a sort of 'beard'. 

That way, even if word somehow got out about Rory and Logan spending a lot of time together, then Rory would still have plausible deniability. 

""How could I be dating Logan? I'm with Paul!"" 

I think that's the only reason she strung Paul along like she did. She didn't keep ""forgetting"" to break up with him like she said in the Revival. I think she stayed with him quite deliberately. 

Of course, this is all conjecture since we know so little about Rory's life pre-Revival, or how she and Logan even started their fling. This is just my hypothesis of how/why Rory started dating Paul and Logan. ",5,6,False,self,,,,,

However, ans I've finished my umphteent re-watch, I find myself annoyed by all the mix-ups with parents in GG. Many of these appear in the same season, making me think that the script for each episode was written before the producers knew what the rest of the season would be about. 

Some examples: 
- Where is Lane's father? In season one she talks about her ""parents"" in the plural many times, but it soon becomes clear that she lives alone with her mother. We get some hints from Mrs. Kim suggesting that she both hates and fears men and that, thankfully, she only had to do ""it"" once with her husband, but where he is and what happened to him is never addressed. I find it weird that Rory, who shares Lane's lack of a live-in father, never mention this. 

- Lorelai ""Trix"" - Early episodes make it sound like she's long gone, but then she suddenly makes an appearance, not many episodes later. 

- Jess's father. When Luke tells Lorelai about Jess for the first time, he make it seem as if Jess's father recently left his family, but when Jess's father comes to SH, he and Jess have never met. I understand that Jess's father is not a major character, but Jess is, and his childhood upbringing is an important part of his backstory, so I've always considered it pretty sloppy that ASP didn't have, at least the biggest, lines of Jess's life figured out before.

Sookie has a cat in the kitchen! I totally forgot about this part. I think it's supposed to be funny because she's all of a sudden nurturing since she's preggo. I've seen several posts about how sloppy, clumsy, and unrealistic Sookies cooking style is. It never bothered me to much, and I always chocked it up to being TV and more focused Sookies quirkiness rather than actual kitchen etiquette, but this one got me. I love cats but GROSS. Cats shouldn't be in the kitchen to begin with let alone a stray that could have so many other diseases or parasites. Then Lorelai comes and says stop feeding it because it will come back not that shouldn't be in the kitchen. OMG! I hate bashing GG but dang this got to me. 

Also in the same episode Sookie just kicks Luke out of his own kitchen Geez!",3,3,False,self,,,,,

In my opinion the main difference between affairs is in connection between Lorelai and Chris and Rory and Dean.

Chris is (at the time) love of Lorelai's life. They have 16 years old daughter. Chris's daughter is everything for Lorelai - she is her life. Chris always tell Lorelai, how much he loves loves her. She leaves Max at the altar because of Chris. They have a long history together - on the other hand, he dates Sherry ... a few moths. Lorelai sees her affair with Chris as their last opportunity to build their life together, so she does it in spite of Sherry.

On the other hand Rory dated Dean for two (?) years - during that time they only saw each other a few times a week for a few hours. On the other hand Dean is with Lindsey more than a year, and they are married almost a year (so they spend all the time together). Rory doesn't see Dean as a love of her life, she only doesn't feel good about her, because she is not especially admired at Yale. She knows, that he is married, but she simply just want to feel good about herself.
