I know it's mostly the writing I should be mad at, and less that I find her self-centered, selfish, entitled, and rude, but the storyline with Luke really gets me up the wall. 

1. She obviously flirts with him (including touching him frequently, and even holding his hand as she leads him into her house when Rory's chick goes missing), but then acts so shocked that he would get the impression that she's interested in him.

2. Certain things are completely overlooked, like when they're hiding from Taylor at Luke's, and they're on the ground together and they lock eyes and hold them for MUCH longer than is normal for two people in a platonic friendship. She's inconsistent with the messages she sends, and then acts completely innocent. 

It's almost like she's relishing in the attention without really wanting to commit. It's not very fair.

Additionally, the relationship between Lorelei and Sookie is terrible. Especially being familiar with Melissa McCartney's recent work, it is so frustrating to see poor, clumsy, obese Sookie who relies on Lorelei for validation and support. In fact, it seems like a lot of the characters rely unnecessarily on Lorelei for support and gratification and she doesn't do a lot to earn it.

Am I alone in this? Does anyone else have any thoughts regarding the characters, especially perhaps while seeing the show for the first time in several years? ",45,12,False,self,,,,,

White Male , Married with 2 kids. I am into Punk, post punk, and rock music. I read a TON, and make a decent living as an artist. I am 6'1, 220 with a manly Beard and can scare children and small animals with a mean glare. 
   I freaking Love this show. I tend to pay attention to writers, producers and directors. I never caught GG when it was on TV the first time, but I happen to get sucked into Bunheads. (sounds strange when you write that out) I was blown away by the dialog. After Bunheads started, I IMDB'ed the heck out of the whole crew and saw GG as the start of it all. Once I heard it was coming to Netflix, the countdown started... literally refreshing my Netflix browser on the 1st till it loaded. 
  Here is why i love this show. 
  It makes me feel like a better person for watching it. I dont watch it and feel dirty. Example:  I saw a Seth Rogan movie a few weeks ago, and I swear I am not a stick in the mud, but after the wife and i watched it, i felt horrible. i felt like I needed a shower. 
  This show makes me feel good. Yes Lauren Graham is easy on the eyes, and its strange seeing Melissa McCarthy as a silly goof, but i can honestly laugh at some VERY witty dialogue without a laugh track to tell me what to do. Great Music selection! Grant lee Philips! rancid mentioned in an early episode.
  Hi-lights:
the way Rory handles Paris. after watching so many episodes of crap TV, it was crazy to see a character treat someone nice who was mean to her, especially after Paris told everyone about Max and Lauralei. I was stunned to see the right choice get made without it getting thrown at us. it is just who Rory is as a person. The thing about that scene, she does this truly wonderful, right thing and there is no one there to tell her she made a good decision. There is no instant gratification for taking the high road, she doesnt run off and tell everyone how good of a person she is, its just who she is. That change in character writing blew my mind. 
 I truly Love this show.
ok ... I am only up to Ep 14 (donna reed) Good lord. But when Rory came out of the house in that dress, my jaw dropped. I instantly knew what she was doing, and knew this was not going to get weird and i would have to send the kids out of the room. :)
 It is so nice to get a sense of the writing so quickly that I can trust the show to not go south on me and everything gets aco-taco in the living room. I miss that Trust in the writers in todays shows.
 I watched a new show (HTGAWM) recently where I do like the show (and the writer) but one episode in and wow... not going to have the kids around to watch that.(why was he on his knees..?)
Its great to recommend a show and it not backfire on you.

Of course you wouldn't expect him to be happy with her response, but if you love someone and they're not at that point then you should give them time without guilting them or getting so angry.

I never gave it much thought during it's original airing. I was actually in the process on catching up on a couple other WB shows that'd missed too (Buffy, Veronica), but Gilmore hitting Netflix has put the brakes on that. I'm halfway through Season 2, and I won't be watching anything else until I'm done.

Some random thoughts from a first time viewer

-I'm a diehard ""Parenthood"" fan, and Gilmore so far has made me a bit angry at that show I love. Parenthood fans know that Lauren Graham's character (while wonderfully acted) has largely been under and misused. I never realized exactly how much until watching Gilmore. It goes without saying saying here, but you know, Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore is just an amazing performance.

-Emily really puts the show over the top.
Obviously it's the Lorelai/Rory relationship that's the deserved headliner, but the show didn't completely hook me until they peeled the onion on Emily a little bit. Say, around the time she broke down leaving Rory's birthday party in Stars Hollow. That complicated relationship is just so compelling, and Graham/Bishop are just so good when they get into it.

-Luke/Lorelai is going to get a little frustrating, right?
I'm also a huge Chuck fan, and I can tell pretty quick that there are going to be some Chuck/Sarah similarities. Which would be both awesome and frustrating. There's just no way to drag out a 5-7 season will they/won't they dynamic without it being a little frustrating. 

Anyway, just some random thoughts from a new viewer. I suspect there are plenty more on the way.

Over the course of Gilmore Girls, she wrote the same character 3-4 different times and I just don't understand. 

What do Rory, April, Paris, and Jess's half sister (sister-in-law?) all have in common? They are freakishly smart book people with some social limitations. And I mean Rory and Paris worked well with each other, but I think April's introduction pushed that whole archetypal smart girl over the edge. Then there is Jess's sister-thing who made her only appearance in ""Here Comes the Son."" That wouldn't be *too* big of a deal since she only appears in one episode, but it *was* a backdoor pilot which means that she was written to be a reoccurring/central character. That would mean that Sherman-Palladino would have written **four** main/central female characters who are insanely smart and quirky with that being their defining characteristic. 

And I'm not saying don't write smart lady characters--but does that need to be the central/defining characteristic of that many characters? Lorelei is smart, but she's not a genius. Emily is smart, but that's not her primary attribute. You can write smart female characters that are more varied than what Sherman-Palladino wrote for those four characters.

I think that Sherman-Palladino had this character in her mind that she just couldn't get perfect on her first try, and had to keep poking at it.

The more I watch this show, the less I like Lorelai for her treatment of Luke (among other things). For 5 entire seasons, he was unreasonably helpful and caring for her and Rory, and she repays him with a one-sided relationship.

#1: Despite Luke being understanding of Chris having to be in her life forever, he swallows his frustration with this reality, and she still doesn't ever tell Luke that she's meeting with Chris prior to seeing him.

#2: When she proposes to Luke, she has just come from a huge fight with her family.  This long romance culminates in another moment of desperate need for Lorelai, as Luke is trying to fix her problems.  This special moment for them is entirely about Lorelai, not about the both of them.

#3: I think postponing the wedding until her and Rory reconcile is perfectly resonable, but she just *tells* Luke instead of it being a discussion. (I guess there are only 42 mins/episode, but you would think that these things are worthy of discussion, rather than ultimatum.)

#4: I'm just getting to this part, but she's pretty unsupportive of Luke having April. Lorelai's dropped bigger life-changing bombshells.

It's interesting to see all the discussions from fresh viewers, particularly for those like me who have a longer relationship with this damn show than some of my actual friendships (the show has just been on a long time, I swear I'm not THAT pathetic ;) )

On that note, I was curious to hear what some of you new viewers think of season 7. I ask because, if you're not aware, season 7 is sort of a sensitive subject with the Gilmore fans. The creator and head writer of the show, Amy Sherman-Palladino, along with her husband and writing/directing partner, Dan Palladino, left the show after renewed contract negotiations failed; despite their departure, GG went on sans them at the helm. With their absence, I sensed a palpable change in the way the show was written and produced, and, to say the least, I wasn't a big fan. For me, watching it when it originally aired was borderline uncomfortable; it felt distinctly different and, well, *off*. I stuck it out the entire season, but hated what I saw and to this day avoid watching it and cut myself off at the conclusion of season 6. 

I'm curious to hear the thoughts of those who are binge watching and perhaps have a different perspective from viewing the show in its entirety from beginning to end. What are your overall perceptions? Do you feel a difference from the rest of the series? Do you feel like you enjoy it just as much as the rest of the show? 

Also, to the long-time viewers, how do you handle season 7? Do you have strong feelings about it, or does it just feel like another season to you? If you hated it before, have you watched it since?

2. The Chris/Paris/Marriage storyline, it was so rushed and just didn't feel authentic to me. It's like she just suddenly dropped all feelings for Luke and was 100% Chris and that Luke was ok with it and wasn't more angry was hard to believe.

3. Rory picking Logan over Jess or just that she kept going back to Logan. Logan, to me, didn't fit her at all.
