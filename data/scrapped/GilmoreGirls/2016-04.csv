Yes. This is my first post under this name. This is sorta fan-ficy. 

I am a huge Gilmore Girls fan. One of my favorite themes of the show throughout its run is the power dynamic between Emily (and Richard, to some degree) and Lorelei about having influence over Rory. There was a scene in the third episode (where Rory goes golfing with Richard) where Lorelei and Emily bicker about Rory's day out. And Emily says very curtly ""Then I win.""

I have always wondered what Emily thought the best case scenario would be. As if she truly won and somehow had full influence and power over Rory, what would have happened?

And this would be early on in the high school years. Not the whole ""Rory freaks out and drops out of Yale"" part.",9,8,False,self,,,,,

I began watching it when season 2 was airing in 2001. It is on constant repeat at my house. I watch the entire series at least 3 times a year and have been doing so since each season DVDs came out.

Like most fans, season 7 is a major let-down for me. I do watch it, but I cringe during every episode. When it originally aired, I was so upset that Lorelai married Christopher - it just never felt right to me! And for the last 7 years or so whenever those episodes come on during my rewatches, I just ache inside, because I love her and Luke together so much. Over the last few rewatches though, I have had an epiphany of sorts. It has changed my view on the marriage between Lorelai and Christopher. I am now glad they got married. Here's why.

Christopher has always been a wedge in Lorelai's relationships. The ""what if?"" was always in Lorelai's mind. Lorelai herself even told Chris this in season 2 (episode 14):

LORELAI: I was just thinking, you know, all these years, no matter what my relationship status has been, whether Ive been dating or hibernating or whatever, I think Ive always had you in the back of my mind - you know, the prospect of us being together. But this prospect was sort of indefinitely on hold while you, you know, found yourself and, uh, got your personal life together so that you could really be there for me and especially for Rory. But you and I have been so linked in my mind that I think I have unconsciously sabotaged every decent relationship Ive had, including the one with Max, because I was waiting for you, and I shouldnt have been. And now that I see that, and I see you settling down with Sherry, I think I can move beyond it.

Lorelai's relationship with Luke would most likely have suffered greatly if this ""what if"" continued to exist. After all, it not only caused them to break up in season 5, but also caused a huge fight after they were engaged. 

I'm now glad that Lorelai explored this ""what if"" in her marriage to Christopher, because now nothing stands in the way of her relationship with Luke. That  ""what if"" was answered. It will never cause a problem in her relationship with Luke again. ",4,11,False,self,,,,,

Though it should be comforting that this implies Matt *was* there and could, you know, read his own lines. Who knows... maybe I'm reading more into this, but it does feel like all signs point to a Rory/Jess endgame. If this is the case, ASP really, really, really needs to do a bang up job of convincing me that 2016 Jess is the one for her.

Off the top of my head, a LOT of Present Perfect (where most Americans would use Simple Past), knickers in a twist, 'have got' instead of 'have' for possession/need/obligation, perhaps, film, lovely, 'love' as a term of endearment, jam (instead of jelly), duvet, jumper (instead of sweater), lots of 'quite', lots of 'sorted', lots of 'proper'. I could go on but I don't want to bore you. Sure, some might be normal (IE: jam) and some might be because there's a proper way of speaking involved to indicate high-class. But I can't find a reason for the repeated 'I've got' or words like 'jumper' instead of sweater.

**1) Jess is best - NO, he's a huge jerk and they do not get joy out of similar things in life.**

Case in point:

&gt;RORY: Come on, lets go to the carnival.

&gt;JESS: I dont go to these stupid town things.

&gt;RORY: You went to the Bid-A-Basket festival. You went to the dance marathon.

&gt;JESS: That was when I was trying to get you. I now have you. That means I dont have to go anymore.

&gt;RORY: Youre serious? JESS: As a heart attack.

&gt;RORY: But itll be fun. JESS: We can have our own fun.

&gt;RORY: I cant miss the winter carnival. JESS: Rory, come on.

&gt;RORY: Well, I never have. I cant. Just go with me, please.

&gt;JESS: Look, how bout you go to the festival, meet Lane, and then Ill hook up with you afterwards.

&gt;RORY: Jess. JESS: Thats my final offer, man. RORY: Fine. JESS: Fine.

The whole do what you have to to get the girl, then treat her like trash? That's garbage.
And he's so rude to Lorelai. And all they have in common is that they like reading? Don't you think most guys Rory meets at YALE like reading?

**2) Rory was over dramatic when dropping out of Yale**

NO. College, especially Yale, is expensive and your time/credits with the greatest professors in the world is extremely valuable. She's considering changing her major from Journalism. It makes total sense not to waste your time with the incredible privilege of learning at Yale and the cost of tuition when you aren't sure about your major. You don't want to just take random classes to graduate, you want to build a knowledge base to advance your future. I agree she ended up floundering in her time off, but her decision to take a semester off I think is pretty solid. Yes, I get that expense wasn't really a factor since Christopher is loaded, but Rory is the type to still consider cost.

**3) Logan is spoiled and a bad influence**

Pure applesauce. Logan was born into an insanely rich family with cold parents. Still, he's extremely intelligent, well read, and talented. Rory says all of this herself, as does Doyle. He is able to par with her witty banter and references in a way we don't see with any other character than Paris (Lorelai to an extent, but she can't handle the more academic references). Logan is smarter and more cultured/well read than Jess.

Logan does well at the job at his father's company but wants to be his own person. He screws up, but recovers. Most accomplished visionaries will immediately point to their failures/mistakes as key to their ultimate success. Once he gets into the business world, he is nothing but driven.

He pushes Rory to stretch her limits- they both grow into better, more confident people in their relationship. They support each other, are honest with each other, and have a truly grown up relationship where they openly discuss their disputes and make up. No other relationship in the show has the level of open communication and respect that theirs grows.

Also, they have HELLA chemistry. He knew she was special from the moment he met her. He rose to the challenge of being her boyfriend. He fully committed.

Yes, there are some rough times- he was a dick to Jess and to Marty, but if you think of it from his perspective, both situations were really sketchy behavior on Rory's part. Going to a secret dinner with your ex while your boyfriend's out of town? Ugh. No wonder he was pissed and acted like a jerk. The most important part though is that Rory and Logan communicated about these problems and made up. The Jess thing was early in their relationship, all of which was new to Logan. He grows and grows during their relationship.

Logan made sure to get to know Lorelai and that they can develop a relationship. He even makes sure she gets a Valentine's present.

Anyway, Rory and Logan forever.

**4) Season Seven is the worst and should be ignored**

Nope, season 6 was the stinker with Rory waffling, April being a stupid plot line, and the Christopher ending. Christopher was not handled well in Season 7, but I think everything else was pretty wonderful in that season.

I was 13.  I don't remember my first impression of the show, or how many eps I saw before I decided it was my *favorite thing ever*.  I think by the time season 2 premiered, I was already a crazy Gilmore obsessed girl who was recording eps on VHS with my VCR and combing the internet for Gilmore news, forums, spoilers, etc.  I went on the WB backlot tour twice (and now I wonder how I convinced my parents to bring me twice).

The first 2 seasons are by far my favorite and season 3 is one of my least fav, and I think it has to do with when I started watching/obsessing over the show.  Crazy as it may sound, the way I approached season 3 was in some ways similar to how some approach the revival.  Instead of rewatching 7 seasons during an 8 year hiatus, I was rewatching 2 seasons over a 4 month hiatus--but 4 months to a 13 yr old is an eternity.  

By the time 3.01 premiered, I had seen the previous eps *many* times, was *very* attached to the characters, and my expectations were sky high because I *loved* everything about the show.  Then the summer hiatus finally ended... I remember enjoying Lazy Hazy Crazy Day and then really not liking most of the rest of the season/series.  From week to week I was frustrated with the overly soap-y drama and overly quirky comedy, and I thought the show had jumped the shark.  Now, years later, I can see that I was being an overly critical 14 yr old who didn't want my fav show to change.  But I still think there is a distinct shift in tone between seasons 2 and 3 that's as noticeable as to the shift from seasons 6 to 7.  Season 3 isn't as bad as I remembered, but the main thing that comes to mind whenever I think of season 3 is annoying Dwight and his lawn.

Just my humble opinion.

Jess had a majorly dysfunctional upbringing, mostly characterized by abandonment and rejection.  His dad seemed like a cold d*** and walked out, and although Tess does grow to become *just* flakey, both Luke and Jess give us lots of clues that she is a complete mess, childish, and maybe has a personality disorder or two.  Because of all this, Jess has major trust issues, anger at everyone and everything, tendency to self-sabotage, and a deep-seated insecurity that alternates between arrogance and self-hatred.

If you haven't experienced an upbringing like this, I can understand why you would find his behavior ""terrible"" or ""unforgivable"" as some have said, but Jess' development is actually really inspirational to me, who, in real life, has been through similar stuff.  My brother and I had a rough home life by any stretch of the imagination, and interestingly to deal with it I became a ""Rory,"" (people pleaser, caretaker, goody goody perfectionist), he became a Jess (left school, drugs, major self-hatred, can't trust, etc).  

The interesting thing about my brother, who has definitely screwed over some very nice girls, is that he basically told me in his roundabout way he's trying to protect them: why get them in too deep when he knows he is just going to ruin it eventually?  I would bet season 3 Jess was unconsciously thinking the same.

Yes, I love Lorelai as much as the next person, and ASP does an amazing job of making us fall in love with someone so flawed, but Rory's upbringing has been strange, too - literally her parents are children, and while we as the audience often think it's cute that a mother/daughter pair often seem like sisters, on another level, it's kind of messed up.  

Lorelai and Christopher did the best they could with a rough situation, but they are both very immature, push others away, and show an unhealthy dependence on Rory (especially Lorelai, obvi).  The way Lorelai pits Rory between her grandparents, especially, is really unfair and inappropriate.

So it makes sense that Rory and Jess would be drawn to each other, each looking for in the other that deep and lasting connection that their parents never had with another person (except Lorelai with Rory), and I think what viewers respond to is the potential they both have to really help the other work through their respective issues.  

And yes, Rory has issues, too, and actually season 6 shows that to us.  She's niave, overly focused on outward approval and worldly success, can be manipulative, and wants to try to ""fix everything.""  Jess wasn't ready to be fixed and I think the message of the relationship between them can be a really empowering one - we can only fix ourselves.  Sometimes people can do that within the context of a relationship, as I did with my Jess-type husband, sometimes they need time and space and may find themselves again, or may come back to the relationship in another form (e.g. as friends).

Edit: Okay, since people have brought it up, about the Keg! Max! episode scene.  Here is *my* take on it only...To me, at this point Jess loves Rory.  (He hasn't said it, just my take.)  He not only finds out he isn't graduating, he finds out he can't take her to the prom, which he couldn't have cared about but she made a big deal about, so he wanted to take her because he cares.  They had planned to have sex and were in agreement about it, but weren't sure about the logistics.  Jess is wallowing in some serious self-destructive haterade.  My take is that in that moment he was kissing Rory, he was misguidedly seeking connection, comfort, and escape from the mess he has made.  Rory says ""wait,"" twice and yes, he should have stopped right then.  100% agree.  But ASP is also careful to show that it's about literally 4 seconds, and he doesn't do anything new that they weren't already doing.  Then Rory gets up and he backs off, though being a *total pr*** about it.  I personally see it as supremely douchey, terrible behavior, but not assault.  That is my perspective, and I really understand if people might see it differently.

I think his guilt over this and his general treatment of Rory in season 3, plus his belief that he will inevitably mess it up, all contribute to how the writers wrote his leaving.  (Additionally, he was supposed to be in a spinoff).  I think Jess knew he had issues he had to work though - with his father, with himself, and he knew it wasn't fair to keep putting it all on Rory.

Although Jess doesn't have much screen time later, the viewer gets the clear impression that Jess' self-concept and view of the world has really matured, and that he has forgiven some of his past stuff, with the implication that he wouldn't self-sabotage and chase away the people he loves nearly as much.  At the time, Rory has lost her way and has gotten totally wrapped up in external stuff (DAR, money, power, etc), and in my mind he is there to remind her to get back to herself - to her own personal power.

Ultimately, I think they are so important to each other not because they have things in common like being well read or even ""smart,"" but because they share a similar depth, and I think it's a depth that people can only really develop when they've been outsiders in some way.  They've also had far too much responsibility for their own parents' emotions foisted on them at a young age.  These experiences and others both shaped Jess and Rory into the best kind of wallflowers, the kind that really mull over the big questions in life, in a way that neither Dean or Logan ever did, or, I would argue, probably could.

So I mean, I am cool with them not getting together, but I really love the way that Jess and Rory weave in and out of each other's lives in significant ways in seasons 2 to 6.  I think they really recognize the deep connection between them and have a real love and respect for each other, and I think the fact they they have each been catalysts for one another's personal growth is really important.  

Addendum: Call it a hunch, but I also strongly suspect Rory may realize the vagabond lifestyle is not as glamorous as she supposed, and that she may prefer Stars Hollow. It would be an interesting parallel arc if Jess, the gnome-stealing Stars Hollow-hater that he was, also ended up there.

Furthermore, I've seen (paraphrasing):  ""I'd hate if Rory ended up with someone new because we won't have had time to get to know them.  How are we supposed to accept a brand new person?""

In a different post today I also saw people saying how much they would hate if she ended up single, because then she would just be too much like Lorelai and repeating her mother's fate of struggling to be with anyone.

So, obviously, no ending will make everyone happy, but what's the best of the scenarios?

Okay, I'm admittedly a Jess fan.  I don't think he was perfect, but he had more of a heart to me then the other characters, which also made him be impetuous and stupid sometimes, but I just genuinely found him to be more earnest and connected, even if those connections were full of friction.  Then of course there's his growth.  Now, one of the things about the show that I really liked is that for all its fancifulness, the tone of the drama has a certain realistic quality that a lot of shows lack.  It's not focused on theme or big act breaks.  Most of the main story lines are intermittent and slow burns like life often is.  Now I was thinking about Jess, and how he wrote a book and how another, what, 9 or 10 years have passed.  Now, if I wanted to be realistic.  If the girl I loved back then wanted to be with me, I'd just laugh.  I mean, I was a kid when we were in a relationship, and a troubled one at that.  It's not that she wouldn't mean a lot to me in my life, but 10 years have passed.  I'm a different person and I don't know who she is either.  That's so much growth.  There's no one I think about as a 30 year old from high school or college, and if a girl was still hung up on me I'd just kind of wince and say sorry and laugh and wish her the best.  But that's just me.  Any of you have any perspective that counters mine?  (FYI I've also never slept with a girl I've broken up with afterward.  At the same time I'm really good friends with my four year ex.  I just never seem to want to retry failures.  And I lose all attraction.  New equals no baggage and discovery.  Much better than trying to patch up something broken.) 

EDIT:  Also, I meant to say that the last interaction we saw was them kissing and Jess said, ""I don't deserve this.""  I think he was right too and if I were him I wouldn't really trust Rory anymore.  I'd be super wary of any romance developing between us.",31,14,False,self,,,,,
