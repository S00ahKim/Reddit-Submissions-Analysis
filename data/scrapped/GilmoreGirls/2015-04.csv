I think Logan's mistake was not discussing it with Rory first. While when/where one proposes should be a surprise, the proposal itself should not be a surprise.

It's tough to explain why I don't think the timing was a mistake, but I'll try. He clearly cared about Rory and thought long about how this would pan out (looked at the papers, houses, etc.). They also said they would factor each other into their future plans. Marrying her would not limit her choices much more than remaining in a relationship. Also, like they stayed together while Logan was away, they could have remained married/engaged if Rory still ended up traveling on the Obama campaign. ",24,26,False,self,,,,,

I absolutely hate Dean in GG. I know it's not the most popular opinion, but I think he's terrible for Rory and I think he's a supreme scumbag.

The problem is, I LOVE Sammy from Supernatural. He's a dear (then again, I'm not that far into it, so maybe he isn't an absolute dear).  It makes it all the more confusing that Dean is Sammy's brother but Sammy is Dean in another show.

It's so weird going from Supernatural to GG.

I was just wondering if any other fans felt this way?

It's just really weird seeing Sam kill people then watch an episode of GG and he's building a car (which is what the Dean in Supernatural would do) for Rory.",15,18,False,self,,,,,
