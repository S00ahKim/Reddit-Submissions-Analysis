In Season 6 we see exactly the opposite of this.

- Luke turns into a complete asshole and goes way out of character by not telling Lorelai about April for no reason other than to have something to fight about. 

- Lorelai turns into a complete selfish lunatic obsessed with getting married for no reason at all. Luke was ok with not having a date for the wedding until things with Rory were ok but now that Luke asks for some time, she needs to get married right away... and goes and sleeps with Christopher the next day.

16,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2017-2-6,2017,2,6,5,5s9nvu,self.GilmoreGirls,First watch through. Thoughts on OS and rant about the revival.

I watched the whole series over the course of 3 months. I loved seasons 1-4, was iffy on 5 and 6 was my least favorite of the OS. I feel like things ended so wrong with the revival and even parts of season 7. I think I am going to ignore the revival and pretend things ended at season 7. I hated the revival with passion. I feel like most of it was lazy writing designed for shock value.

Before I get into Rory I want to talk about Lane. I was so sad about how Lane's story ended. I loved her charter she was actually one of my favorites. She and Dave were perfect together and I know the actor left for a differnt show but hooking Lane up with Zach felt so wrong. LANE DESERVED BETTER!!! ZACH IS SOOOOOO STUPID like in french twist when he thinks that the twins are conjoined. WTF??? Lane spent so much time and effort to get out of underneath her mother's thumb and she ends up stuck in Stars Hollow with two babies. The worst part is Zach gets to go on tour and Lane is stuck at home with two babies. I know the pregnancy helps her mend her relationship with her mom but I still feel like Lane deserved to see the world and play her music. I know she probably wouldn't have succeed in music long term but it would have been nice to see her play in a mildly successful band for a few years and then maybe move to NY or LA to work in the business. If she moved to CA maybe she would have gotten back with Dave. I just don't think Lane's story should have ended the way it did. I know she seemed happy in the revival but I just feel like her character could have done bigger things. 

I was really disappointed that Lorelei and Luke were not married by the revival. It's clear that Lorelei wanted to get married again and have more kids It just doesn't feel right to me. 

And poor Paris! I don't think she and Doyle would split up they were perfect together. Also I am so mad about the Chilton scene. Paris falls apart at the sight of a high-school crush??? Paris liked Tristan for a few weeks when she was 16 it doesn't make sense that she would fall apart at the sight of him 20 years later. The Paris I know would not have cared.  

I was absolutely devastated about Rory's story in the revival.Rory turns into someone who would make her past self cringe. I have never said Rory was an angel. She had a great deal of flaws but a large sum of those flaws were based in immaturity and circumstance, and I think that she deserved better than to be denied the opportunity to grow and evolve into somebody better. I don't believe that 32 year old Rory would be making the same mistakes as late teens/ early 20's Rory.

Unpopular opinion but I actually liked Rory in most of the OS. She has her spoiled moments but I liked her overall. The revival just ruined all of her character development. It just didn't make any sense. Rory in the OS was a hard worker. She always pushed herself to be the best in school and she did great work on the school newspaper. She works really hard at her community service jobs even though she could have done the bare minimum and just skated by. Also she saves the DAR event. She seems to make a great editor at the Yale daily News also. She should have been more successful in the revival. The job covering the Obama campaign was a great starting off point and hell Rory went to Yale she has so many contacts. I feel like ASP made Rory unsuccessful so she could shove in her originally planned ending. It would have made more sense if Rory had a somewhat successful career but then had a quarter life crisis and realized that journalism was not for her. Then it would make more sense to see her flounder a little and eventually land on writing the book.

The cheating with Logan just didn't work for me. Yes, she cheated with Dean but she was also 18 or 19 at the time. She messed up but it seemed like she had learned something.  I liked Rory and Logan in the OS but I feel like things should have ended with her rejecting his proposal. I know most people think the baby is Logan's but I hope its not. I would just like the relationship between them to end. Which sucks becasue I loved them in the OS.

Rory's pregnancy doesn't make any sense to me. What was the point of dedicating a show to a mother lifting a daughter away from her own life mistakes only to know you were going to throw that daughter into the same mistake at the end? Just because journalism wasn't right for her doesn't mean having a baby will be. There are a million things that Rory could do. ASP just straps this woman with a baby instead of the opportunity to continue to grow and find herself with freedom and self possession. I think it would be interesting if Rory ended up not having the child. 

Overall, I think the revival didn't work in part becasue ASP totally ignored S7 and all the character development that occurred.  Second thing that happened is ASP trying to force her ending 10 years later. The floundering and cluelessness would have been acceptable for 22-23 year old Rory but not a 32 year old women. It just doesn't feel like Rory..We can't be expected to believe that Rory, though flawed, has lost every shred of her dauntless work effort in 10 years.  She matured during S7 and I don't think she deserved this ending",17,70,False,spoiler,,,,,
17,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2017-2-6,2017,2,6,10,5sb8hv,self.GilmoreGirls,[Revival Spoilers] Never watched the OS. I watched AYITL.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5sb8hv/revival_spoilers_never_watched_the_os_i_watched/,heartsmile,1486343968,"I know the title is probably making your stomach churn. I know. I know.


Well, on a whim, I saw AYITL on Netflix and pressed play. I was only vaguely aware of some of the characters and major story arcs from the OS. I have since gone back to watch the series from the beginning and am in the beginning of Season 5 of the OS (and loving it!).


I wanted to write down some of the initial thoughts I had on AYITL coming from someone with very fresh eyes. I know many are disappointed about the revival, but I actually really enjoyed it. So, for your consideration, here are my impressions:


* All 3 Gilmore Girls come across as extremely **depressed** and lost throughout AYITL, except for the very end of Fall.


* Lorelai: She is seen watching a LOT of TV.. it surprised me given what I vaguely knew about the show. Her DVR is filled to the brim and that made me sad. The source of her unhappiness seems to jump from one thing to another. It's her parents, it's that Luke and her never had kids or got married, it's because Sookie is gone and she cant find a chef and Michel is unhappy.


* Emily: Understandably, she is unhinged due to the death of Richard. She is throwing away everything she owns, seems disoriented and sleeps excessively.


* Rory: I had absolutely *no idea* what Rory was doing / where she was going most of the time. She never told the truth to anyone about what she was doing. She also seemed incredibly depressed -- drinking, destructive sexual behavior and erratic emotions and actions.


* Logan: Came across as kind of cold and one-dimensional. Charming, but cold. Incredible bod. I think his lack of depth was purposeful.


* Dean: The scene with Dean had me cringing for Rory. I actually had to pause it and take a breath. It seemed so sad and desperate and just weird. Dean was nice, but you could tell he wanted to get out of there, stat! 


* Jess: Came across as a good, old friend. He reminded me of Luke. He seemed to know her very well as he came up with the idea for the book  and he was right about it. It was exactly what she needed. The stare through the window completely shocked me. At the end, I felt like it was clear they were hinting at some future with Jess and Rory.


* The ending: In the end, I think we are supposed to believe that all 3 Gilmore Girls have found their way again. Emily's was the most convincing with her new life in Nantucket. Lorelai is expanding the Dragonfly, Sookie is back, she married Luke and achieved some closure with Emily through therapy and while on the hike.


* Last 4 words: What I read over and over is what a disappointment Rory was in the revival. How she deserved MORE than this. I feel like I am the only one who thought she chose this? This is what she wanted. She was literally ungrounded this whole series. Flying around from one place to the next with no purpose and no anchor. She found her anchor through family  by writing the book about her relationship with her mother and her family, the most important thing in her life, and then by choosing the journey to become a mother herself. Many say this is where she became unraveled. I think this is where she finally started living her life. I thought it was beautiful. 


Now, having seen some of the OS, I see Rory as someone who simply lives a life built on the expectations of others. Lorelai faced these same type of expectations growing up and fought against them her entire life.


Whose idea was Harvard? Christiane Amanpour? Its never explicitly stated, but it has to be Lorelais. A four-year-old Rory wouldnt be able to understand, much less express interest in buying a Harvard pennant to hang on her wall. These were Lorelais dreams and they were imposed on Rory just like Emily and Richard did to Lorelai.


Now, during AYITL, we see Rory making a decision to find happiness and purpose, the same happiness and purpose that Lorelai and Rorys relationship brings, through motherhood. This choice is potentially frowned upon by by her mom, grandmother  and even us  the VIEWERS  who had the HIGHEST expectations of her, put our dreams on her shoulders. Its actually incredibly clever and smart and beautiful and fitting. And I loved it all (except the musical!).",32,105,False,spoiler,,,,,

I have loved this show, watched and rewatched it so many times. 

I was so excited for the revival. I thought that we'd get to know where ASP was going to take things. I noticed key themes in the show and wanted to know how she'd develop them. What did she dream for these characters? What did she want for them?

AYITL forced me to face the reality that she didn't want anything for these characters. She doesn't love them, doesn't have dreams for them. She wrote a show she thought was witty and would get good ratings. She didn't have long term vision for the characters- she wrote what she thought would be interesting and good TV at the time and that was that.

She said in 2005 (mid S6): ""We have [Matt Czuchry] for the entire year, so kids need to remember that. He's getting paid for the whole year. You don't want to waste that when you're paying for it."" 

I hate that she would reduce Logan/Matt to that. I tried to ignore that quote, but it shows the truth. She said she loved Matt. Logan was an interesting character. But no, ultimately she just cared about her budget.

I put so much into thinking about arcs on this show- the tension of Rory being Lorelai's mini-me or Emily's do-over- I loved that. Which life would she choose? Isn't Lorelai just as pushy as Emily in a way?  Is it better to be best friends with your daughter or to take a ""most knows best"" attitude? That was a consistent theme and the boyfriends in Rory's life all fit in that tension as well.

I looked for clues and threads and ached to know where Rory was going. But she was going no where. ASP had a stupid twist ending in her head and that was it.

Now watching the OS is upsetting because it seems like I care more about the characters, what they were thinking and feeling, where the were going, the complexity of their decisions and emotions- way, way more than Amy ever did. She didn't have a vision. She just wrote witty, dramatic scripts and pieced them together.",103,96,False,spoiler,,,,,

Like just finished watching the finale, and he was so difficult with ""unofficial"" party. And not only that, he was so difficult to work with, I found him quirky at the beginning but I got tired of him by the end of season 1 lol. 

Babette's voice
Just too raspy for my liking. 

Logan/Rory relationship 
I really never saw any real love between them? It always felt forced to me. 

Grandparents treatment 
Sure Richard and Emily had their flaws, but I just feel like Lorelai never truly forgave Emily for all that she did to her during her childhood. Like if you hate your mother that much, why keep taking the help/money? Why don't you throw that in her face? And now Rory! Suuuuuuper ungrateful! After going through her crazy period of dropping out of Yale, her grandparents happily let her move right in and she just moved out without saying goodbye or thanks. 

The Rory/Lorelai sarcasm 
In my everyday life, I tease and throw a little sarcasm out there, but gahhhh! These women can't have an actual conversation without doing a bit or being OVERLY sarcastic.

I know many of us are torn over the idea of more Gilmore girls and at what cost to the fans (and our beloved characters).  But what if Netflix decided (unsurprisingly) to milk this financial cow and ordered another season? What if the Palladinos keeping what little creative ***cough** integrity they had left bowed out of said project?  What if we got another year with our girls but in a twist of all twists and dj vu, Netflix called upon someone else who was familiar with the show to captain the ship, a Mr. David S. Rosenthal who would be tasked once again with the impossible job of cleaning up the heartache that was AYITL. What would a post-revival year helmed by Rosenthal look like? I know some of you will say we'd be riddled with OOC but I'd argue that AYITL suffered the same fate. So let's dive into this history repeating rabbit hole.

**What I am hoping wed get:**

* Rory would be recognizable again. The baby would be her wakeup call and shell make lemonade with the lemons she was dealt. Shed tell Logan about the baby and tell him she doesnt need anything from him, but hes welcome to be a part of the babys life. As for him being in *her* life that will be up in the air and will be one of the plot lines of AYITL 2. Well also learn about the events after Rory set off on the Obama campaign and the ensuing years afterwards. Well get a flashback of what happened in Hamburg. Rory will finish her book and well see her struggling to find someone who is willing to publish it. (My question:  will we see the resurfacing of Rosenthals famous rocket?)

* Logan with his backbone reattached. Most fans would agree that the culmination of Logans growth happened in Rosenthals S7.  I think DSR would try to give the Logan character a redemption arc, I cant for sure say what that would look like but it would probably begin with him stepping up as a father. Well learn where Logan went after his failed proposal and how he ended up back with HPG.

* Emily will be involved in as much as she can from Nantucket. Perhaps Rory goes to her for an extended visit for the majority of her pregnancy (to escape townie questions of who's the father?) where Emily in true Emily fashion coddles Rory to the point where she runs back to SH. There will be the usual drama between Emily and Lorelai over how Lorelai could let this (pregnancy) happen etc. 

* Lorelai will be immersed in opening the second location of the inn. Shell be burdened with worry over Rory and the baby, Emilys declining health, Lukes avoidance of his health and will continue to see the therapist.

* Luke, after suffering a minor stroke due to stress and high blood pressure, is convinced by Lorelai (and April) to cut back his hours at the diner, promoting Zach to general manager. He fills his time instead meddling in the construction of the Inn #2 (trying to prove hes still able-bodied) to the annoyance of Tom and Lorelai.

* With Lane, well see the joy of being a mom to tween boys especially when one of them (Steve) wants to learn more about his Korean heritage much to the delight of Mrs. Kim.  Lane starts an anonymous podcast (she uses a voice disguiser, those exists right?) about Stars Hollow and the townies and everyone spends the entire year trying to figure out whos behind the mic.

**What we probably *wouldnt* get:**

* Jess returning  Milo has said that he wouldnt do Gilmore girls without ASP, I believe him. 

**What would probably stay the same:**

* No Sookie. Melissa McCarthy has said she wouldnt play the Sookie character again. Without Sookie, we probably wont get Jackson or their motley crew.
* No Dean for obvious reasons.

Thats what I think would happen if we got a Rosenthal post-revival year. What about you guys?

Then, she entered Yale and automatically began to reject and despise men like Logan (nothing more than an improved version of Tristan, at first) and I thought: It makes sense, she has matured.

Here comes AYITL showing how a 32-year-old Paris is still the insecure and neurotic, the same Paris of Chilton, worried about what Tristan would think and afraid to be rejected by a man who probably doesn't get to her feet. Seriously, ASP?

I try to imagine that it was just an additional comic feature, but I really hate that they have to show Paris that way. I wish she'd was already sure she owns the world now. They could maintain the traits of her personality without insinuating a character regression.",6,10,False,self,,,,,

It's her mother.

Why does no one talk about how much of a NIGHTMARE her mother is? From not allowing Lane to attend the college she wants (And therefore encouraging her to not attend at all ???) her mother represents a true narcissist who, when she fucks up her child's life, takes NO responsibility for it. When I saw Lane's mom do ridiculous shit like send her to Korea with one plane ticket and not have an exit plan, it was incredibly hard to watch. How the hell is Lane supposed to keep up with her studies, friends, life when she has no stability? She seemed to be at the complete mercy of her mom's ridiculous whims. The best thing Lane could've done was packed up the moment she left 18, gone to a great institution as a fuck you to her ridiculous upbringing, and never looked back.

Gilmore Girls as a whole has a problem with incredibly entitled people, but Lane's mother takes it to another level - we just don't realize it because she's not also incredibly rich.
I've had overbearing parents and grown up like Lane and it took me SO long to realize that having narcissistic parents like that will only make them identify with you in relation to them. That is why Lane's mother gave no shits about Lane's passions, encouraged her in any way, etc. She only served to yell at Lane for any little thing she liked that basically wasn't Christianity and it's bs Korean values (like marrying a Korean boy or whatever). It's so hard to stomache, especially as I've gotten older.

Now, more troublingly, the trend here has been to justify Lane's life as ""Fulfilled"" or whatever. Fuuuck that. We need to acknowledge that someone with incredible potential was shut down entirely, and none of it was served with the gravitas that Rory's hilarious exit from Yale was given. It's also hilarious the gravitas that Emily is given over being a ""horrible mother."" If Lane had Lorelei or Emily as her mother she would have soared. 

Lane is someone who was incredible and had arguably more potential than Rory in some ways as she always struck me as someone who went after what she wants. This is a girl who should've done an Almost Famous and followed famous bands, someone who was begging to break free of the mold. And for the first three seasons she did just that. To see that character just completely shunted down by life was INCREDIBLY hard to watch and arguably the WORST part of the revival for me. Fuck. I mean you couldn't throw in a scene of Lane atleast breaking up with Zach? She had to be pregnant too? The writing turned incredibly weird and lost interest in Lane's story as they ended.

I feel sad at Lane's life although more and more people try to justify it with her twin babies as her joy. That trend is alarming to me. 

TLDR; Lane's mother is abusive and extremely problematic.",34,39,False,spoiler,,,,,

No matter what the ending would have totally felt suprising and really annoying. Everytime a series finale of a show is a cliffhanger, it really makes me mad. But I would have quickly moved past it and would probably not be as upset as I am now. I watched the show when it originally aired on tv so I have accepted that the show was over. When the revival was announced I was excpecting an actual ending. Especially since that is how it was advertised. So now I had another year to get excited and expect a conclusion. so the last four words suprised me and was super disappointing. Now I want to now what is going to happen, especially since Lorelai and Emily both had enough of an ending. But Rory and Lorelai felt like they were in the same place as they were in at the end of the OS. So the ending for Rory felt even more frustrating since her whole storyline just felt frustrating. Lorelai also had an overall frustrating storyline. This just made wanting to know what happens even stronger. There endings would have seemed so much better sooner after the ending of the OS. So  overall, I feel like this ending would have been better sooner and not almost ten years after the original run. ",2,1,False,spoiler,,,,,

A full-time nanny could've been hired by the families, Lorelai and/or Christopher could've finished school as planned, even go off to college if they really wanted to.

I hosted in Chicago.

Two weeks ago I asked for a list of essential episodes to watch so that I could host this event without being a total n00b and you guys helped out with a select list. I went online and hunted through many articles, IMDB ratings, and comments to add even more to the list once I got started. 

In the end, I watched 47 episodes of the series. I got so into it that I wanted to keep watching every episode, even though I did not have time. I powered through and came out on top just as satisfied and dissatisfied as long-term fans (more on that later). There are certainly episodes I think I should have watched that I missed and some that I watched that ultimately were pretty fluffy, but I think I got a very nice taste of the entire show.

Favorite Main Character: 

- It's a tie between Emily and Luke. Emily because she is just so damn snarky and wonderful (and a lot more heartfelt than Lorelai is willing to admit) and Luke because he's straight-up a perfect male role model (other than occasionally being too closed-off, but come on he makes up for it by doing rather than telling).

Favorite Side Character: 

- Sookie. Runner-up would definitely be Paris.

Least Favorite Main Character: 

- It's a tie between Rory and Lorelai. Rory does literally nothing for me as a character other than her occasionally cute line delivery (cute, but not great delivery). My heart is with Lorelai, but my head is not. I honestly find her so incredibly selfish. Her grudge against her parents (who, sure, tried to control her life but also literally gave her and her daughter *everything*) just constantly reads like a know-it-all snotty teenager.

Least Favorite Side Character: 

- Logan. God, how I hate Logan. And Jess. Just the worst. In fact, every one of Rory's love interests is really bad except Dean - who is also really bad for cheating on his wife and being kind of a douche when it comes to gender roles (but hey, I'm still an Angel and a Riley fan from Buffy, so I guess I'm sucker for young love and Midwestern-values folks like myself).

Also Least Favorite Side Character: 

- Christopher. Seriously, Chris: you suck. Go away. Stay away (except where your daughter is concerned, you've stayed away far too much in that regard, asshat).

Character MVP: 

- Luke. Luke is my spirit animal.

Actor MVP: 

- Tie between Kelly Bishop (who steals every single scene) and Lauren Graham who is great at the wit and the drama throughout the show.

Random Thoughts:

- I definitely understand the hate against Season 7 for being different in terms of plot quality and dialogue writing, but honestly, I felt the revival was even worse. The drama was there in the revival, but it the ""feel"" of Gilmore Girls was virtually non-existent. The endless parade of cameos didn't help (except for Peter Krause, who should be in all things).

- I wish I had watched more Season 2/3 episodes and less Season 6/7 episodes, but I didn't think I would get as into it as I did and at some points I just needed to keep watching (who suggests only watching the first in a pair of episodes where Richard ends up in the hospital?!). 

- I wish the side characters were more fleshed out. I get that they all add to quirky flavor of the show, but coming from Joss Whedon-land I was hoping that at some point we would actually get some humanization on people like Kirk, Taylor, Miss Patty, Babette, etc. - but it doesn't really happen. They are just running gags. Great running gags, but still gags.

- Although I like Lane, every time she appeared on screen in the later seasons I got incredibly bored. Especially when she was with the band (and I'm a Skid Row fan!). Also, Zach was absolutely no Seth Cohen from The OC. 

- I think the show was at its best when being straight-up dramatic. Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop absolutely nail their dramatic scenes in such a phenomenal way that I wish there was even more drama and less silliness.

- I would like to see a DAR party thrown by Emily Gilmore and Lucille Bluth. In fact, can we just get a spin-off show starring Emily Gilmore and Lucille Bluth?

She's my favorite character, possibly ever. Of course, my other ""ultimate"" favorite characters are Hanna (Girls), Rachel (Glee) and Sue Heck (The Middle). So I guess those say a lot about me! 

The thing is, I also question a lot Rory's actions but I always think they make sense because of the way she was brought up. I forgave Rory a long time ago for choosing to be like Emily and Richard as opposed to Lorelai. I forgave her for choosing the luxurious life over working and earning her way through the world. I understand why she did so, and not just because it's easier and who wouldn't (honestly)... but because it made sense. 

I don't dislike the revival. In fact, I've watched those episodes three times (skipped through the musicals though. Once was more than enough). I don't think Rory's a failure. I still look up to her, being close to a decade younger than her; I truly want to have a life like hers: traveling, being bold enough to go after what I want, not being tied down by responsibilities like a husband and kids... 

I hate a lot of what she's doing in the revival, I hated a lot of the things she did in the OS. But the only thing that really ever annoyed me with this show was Lorelai's attitude towards Rory, and her quick mom-mode that she pulled sometimes (maybe a total of 4 times through out the 7 seasons ) that was confusing and unfair to Rory. 

I think Rory had a lot of good qualities. I think this time around, with the revival; nothing was serious. ASP clearly didn't want to write another Gilmore Girls that ran 7 seasons... she just wanted to finish the first, have a little more fun. So that's what she did. It was wacky, theatrical, over the top and not serious at all. I don't know why people have gotten so sensitive over the past few years. 

Rory and Lorelai were like this in the OS too, but we just saw them in so many other situations that their awfulness was not as heightened. ",36,78,False,self,,,,,

I am watching *Gilmore Girls* for the first time, and I just finished season 6. I'm now wondering in which order to watch season 7 and the revival.

I know the traditional order is to watch season 7 first. I'll be able to pick up right where I left off that way, seeing the resolution to the Luke/Lorelai/Chris love triangle. I'll also be able to see the resolution to the Rory/Logan relationship. I vaguely know that Luke and Lorelai end up together, and that Rory ends up single, but I have no idea how they get to those places. For all I know, Logan leaves Rory for Dean, forming a relationship based off mutual not-as-good-as-Jessness. But I don't know how that all happens, so it'd be interesting to see.

Yet I think I also have a unique opportunity to see *Gilmore Girls* as Amy Sherman Palladino envisioned it. Indeed, from what I have heard, Palladino has never even watched season 7, and largely ignored its existence when writing the revival. So I essentially pick up where Palladino left off, and see the show end as she wanted. I could then watch season 7, treating it almost as an ""alternate ending."" Of course, the downside here is that I'll somewhat be leaving the canon chronological order, though again, I've heard Palladino largely disregarded season 7 cannon.

More crucially, it no longer means what it did to you back then and in all the years you rode on that initial intimate impression... Because your impression was shattered. The revival's fundamental lack of self awareness is evident in the fact that it's not bad, per se - it just lacks the untraceable magic that made GG so appealing. The je-ne-sais-quoi that drew us to do lengthy, curious analyses of seemingly mundane events years after the series aired. The OS made us feel it was more than the sum of its parts. It was a collective sleight-of-hand on all of us that was good enough even if it was not intentional. With the revival, the je-ne-sais-quoi was laid bare for us to re-examine under fluorescent lights. We took a hard look at it and saw it clearly for what it was: parts. Calculated, measured, worked-out parts like most television that fails to work magic. And just like that, the passion was gone and Gilmore Girls was dead.",16,21,False,self,,,,,

So many show rely on the idea that if the bad boy falls in love with the good girl then she will change him and make him a better person. 

But we dont get that with Jess. He is still fundamentally an emotional mess during his relationship with Rory. His communication skills dont get better, his self-esteem is still non-existent, he still flunks out of school and he spirals down into his lowest point during the whole series, which causes their break up. And thats because the show recognises that Jess issues cannot be cured by Rory.

Instead, Jess has to go away and sort himself out. Hes still not on that path for most of Season 4. Hes still struggling to communicate, still running away from his emotions and problems, and still lashing out at those around him. His defence mechanisms remain on their highest settings. And again, the show doesnt go the easy route, in having him realise how much he loves Rory as the catalyst for change of him. 

Instead, its his relationship with Luke that is the turning point for him. Its Luke who gives him the self-help book that allows Jess to learn how to deal with his emotions in a more productive and healthy way; to learn not to compartmentalise everything and instead come to terms with his thoughts and feelings instead. Its Luke who gives Jess the validation that he desperately needs and lets him know that hell always be there for him. The first time that someone actually gives him that unconditional support and love, which Luke recognises that Jess needs so badly at this moment in time.

In fact, when Jess, actually optimistic for once that hes been able to process his emotions in the proper manner, goes to see Rory, she shuts him down and reinforces that he still has a long way to go before hes in a healthy state of mind.

Then, when we meet Jess again in Season 6, hes moved passed his depression and has become the person who always had so much potential if only he could just find some self-belief and healthier ways to deal with his problems. He has built a life for himself away from any family but also away from any of his demons, and hes done this on his own. As the revival shows us, he has continued that growth into the mature and healthy person we see who is able to support and give advice to those around him.  

Jess ends the series as one of the more stable and mature characters in the series and I always love that he manages this feat by himself. Its not tied to a frankly unhealthy and co-dependent trope of changing to get the girl. Instead, he recognises how he has sabotaged his own life and turns himself around. This is the kind of character development I live for.

Okay So... did Rory trap Logan by getting pregnant (c'mon there is no question it's his) or was this an oops from a previous sexy encounter? You see Rory taking back a couple of shots through the revival, although, she could not know at the time she's pregnant. When Logan gets the Life and Death Brigade together to show her a good time I don't remember her drinking much so I guess she could have already known. It just seems a little suspicious to me that she asks him at the club if he is ""seriously going to marry Odette"" and he tells her that's definitely the plan. Then that evening they obviously have sexy time and in the morning she's heavily contemplating things. She could have been giving him the opportunity to say he is going to break it off to be with her (with her already knowing she pregnant). It's just with how Rory feels her life is going in shambles and how selfish she is, I don't put it past her to do something manipulative like try to trap Logan. Anyways, that's just my rant and it's kind of an eye opener for me. Thoughts and feedback are much appreciated! I can't possibly be the only person thinking this.",14,4,False,spoiler,,,,,

I guess the best way I can describe what I mean is this : Moments that seem improvised, real and natural. For me, there's a lot of them... A few that stand out the most are : 

Season 1 - that Damn Donna Reed episode 

Lorelai is sewing a button to Rory's school blazer and Rory keeps moving (she's studying her flashcards). The moment that Lorelai nags her to stand still, and then someone knocks on the door and Rory just leaves to get the door and Lorelai says, in this disappointing tone, *""You're four years old.""* SO CUTE. 

Just the way she says it, so quietly it just seems so natural and maternal. I've definitely had a few of these moments with my mom. It was just so real, mostly because even the camera seemed to not be on Lauren (Lorelai) and she just said it. Makes me wonder if it really was improvisation or not. Knowing Amy, though, that's unlikely.

Season 2 - It Should've Been Lorelai episode 

Rory and Lorelai are channel surfing and they land on the BBC cooking show, ""Two Fat Ladies"". That whole scene, and when Lorelai says ""Cause one of the fat ladies met her maker..."" and Rory, while laughing says ""Which one? The one on the motorcycle or the one..."" and they're just laughing so hard. Adorable. 

Season 3 - First episode 

Rory's been in Chicago. Lorelai goes to the airport (?) to pick her up, and they hug each other and fall down... Just like literally dropping down. I thought that was either really well acted, or actually happened. Cause they totally fell! 

Also, hilarious moment; when Rory and Lorelai are practicing what to tell Dean about Rory kissing Tristian when they were broken up at a party... and Lorelai's pretending to be Dean, so she changes her voice to a man voice. lol That came out of nowhere! 

Also, in season 4, when Richard and Emily make the girls eat Marzipan! Rory eats one and then Lorelai gets jealous and wants to try one too, Rory's like, trying to warn her without being too subtle about it...Then Jason comes by and Lorelai invites him to have one... Rory and Lorelai's reaction to his fake love for it. 

And can't leave out Lorelai making fun of Rory's voice! LOL

Last one, I'm not a Jess fan; but this is unbelievably cute ...

I just feel like kind of listing my grievances before I continue to see if anyone feels the same way.

The main thing that is bugging me is I  just can't listen to any of their guests anymore I think I'm  on episode 6, season 2 of the podcast. I am just skipping through the episodes like crazy because the guest usually hates Gilmore girls which is fine but the same criticisms crop up all the time.( Usually because they have watched a grand total of one episode out of context) i.e.

-The dialogue is too fast and unrealistic

-The people are too quirky and unrealistic

-The references are obscure,too old for the target demographic 

-There isn't much going on plot-wise

If you don't like any of these things then you are not going to like the show  because these are mainly stylistic choices but I feel like Kevin or something should have pre-warned these guests that they have gone over these particular points a million times by now or at least put on his interviewer hat and scold them every time they mention them.

Demi and Kevin seem to fold like a wet paper towel every time too, changing their opinion to match the guests so where is the debate or interest there? I feel like Demi in particular is too eager to suddenly agree with whatever they say (and it's obviously not his intention) but it feels he or the guest is trying to insinuate that show is feminine but not enough to be gross.( Like a guy saying you look great to his friend and then shouting ""no homo"" a second later).

The podcast is meant for fans but I don't think I ever encountered a show which is so embarrassed by its own subject matter. It feels like the hosts are constantly afraid their man card is being revoked if they defend it. It's like if I started watching sports and the commentators where constantly throwing the premise of sports under a bus ( ""It's just two guys kicking a ball ,big deal"") or if  there was like a Star Wars podcast and they kept talking about how unrealistic lightsabers are and how dumb all the names of the characters are , I mean technically yes all these points are valid but they take all the fun out of the subject matter. Surely it matters more that whatever the entertainment is it has an internal logic that makes sense within the context of the show and its premise. 

I also feel like the genuine moments of rejoicing in the good and bad of the show are so few and far between. It all about boom mics, cheap sets, screen ratio ,centred/uncentred titles like it's a tv show not Avatar who cares. I really wish they would concentrate on the dialogue and story development ,decoding the references which they do eventually get around to after they have gabbed about nothing for half an hour and then at the end they plug the guest who added nothing to the show.

Also just to be super nitpicky ,because I'm on a roll ,some of the general points that they make about the show are kind of unfair  for example they constantly praise the fact that the show is  light on the melodrama but then lament that nothing significant happens especially when a guest is on like they are trying to anticipate the guests inevitable criticism.

Then they also constantly accuse the show of painting races into specific roles and then completely dismiss Michel as a black character because he's not an American representation of a black character.  (I mean think of the reverse, people in Poland are not white because they don't drink pumpkin spice lattes or go to Walmart?).Then by the same token he criticizes Amy Sherman Palladino for concentrating on Lane's Korean and Christian background calling it racist even though it's based on an actual person whose culture was central to their life? I mean I agree there is a lack of diversity on the show and the characters that are present are really underwritten (What they did to Lane in season 7 was unforgivable in my opinion) but come on you can't moan about a lack of nuance in the minorities on the show and then say Michel isn't black because he also happens to be French.

I've harped on a lot but there are a lot of great things about this podcast especially when it's just Demi and Kevin who are hilarious I think they play well off each other but the guests and the way they handle the guests is just annoying.",41,26,False,self,,,,,
