&gt;**Rory**: You have every door open to you! You have opportunities that anyone would kill for, including me!  
**Logan**: No one's stopping you from making whatever you want happen! Go into journalism, go into politics, be a doctor, be a clown, do whatever you want!  
**Rory**: It's not as easy when it's not handed to you!  
**Logan**: Really? It's all so easy for me? I don't want that life! It's forced on me! *You talk about all these doors being open? All I see is one door, and I'm being pushed through it!* I have no choice, you try living without options!

Logan's line here really got me thinking. It is easy to feel bad for Logan being forced to pursue business opportunities that he doesn't want (moving to London after graduation comes to mind). On the other hand, I can't help but feel that Mitchum wouldn't push Logan nearly as hard if Logan showed any interest in pursuing... anything. We see Logan waste a lot of time partying, hanging out with the Life and Death Brigade, and shirking his responsibilities at Yale and on the paper. Logan being ""pushed through"" that one door, then, kind of seems to be his own fault. Though, I can see how growing up with a family like his would encourage rebellion.

Do you think Mitchum would force his choices on Logan so much if Logan actually showed ambition in more meaningful areas of his life? Even if he wasn't pursing the same career path as Mitchum (e.g., if Logan was passionate about and working diligently toward a career that made very little money, would Mitchum still be forcing him into his own business)?",19,19,False,self,,,,,

Im rewatching season one and wanted to share a random thought.

S1 episode 20, when Rory is in a funk over her breakup with Dean, Lorelei decides to confront Dean at work and say she thinks he is scum for breaking up with Rory. 

This makes me irrationally angry. Dean is a 16 year old, even if he had mistreated Rory (cheated on her, etc), I still think she would be completely out of line! It is so inappropriate for her to yell at a teenager because he happened to hurt her daughters feelings. Not to mention, I know its been discussed a lot on here, but Lorelei is doing Rory a disservice by always calling her and treating her like a perfect angel who never deserves to have anything/anyone rock her boat. I know she loves Rory, but Rory is a normal human being who is going to be rejected just like everybody else, and Lorelei constantly fawning over her and yelling at anyone who hurts her isnt helping Rory or anyone else, not to mention it is extremely irritating (in my opinion). Lorelei should have just been a supportive mother during the breakup and left it at that. If I were Dean I would want nothing to do with the Gilmores (clearly he didnt feel the same way haha). Im not necessarily a Dean fan, but I feel for him in that scene.

But Paris and Emily were in the same room in the episode directly before this one: they both went to the Bracebridge Dinner.

Are we to conclude that:

Theory 1: the GG universe really did implode at the Bracebridge Dinner. Every subsequent episode is just the characters imagining how their lives would have panned out in the last few moments before their consciousness is vapourised.

Theory 2: the Bracebridge Dinner was an extended dream sequence. But who was dreaming it? 

There are two events at the dinner that we know actually happened because they come up in later episodes: Richard's retirement, and Emily hosting DAR meetings at the Inn. Therefore, Richard or Emily could be the dreamer. But how could either of them dream about Paris when they hadn't met her?

If it was a dream, I suggest Rory or Lorelai is the dreamer. They both know all the relevant characters, plus either one of them could have spoken to Richard and Emily and said, ""I had the strangest dream that you were retiring/ hosting meetings at the Inn"" which planted the seed for those things to actually happen.

Theory 3: Secrets and Loans is set in a parallel universe where the Bracebridge Dinner never took place. This explains the frankly weird occurrences in the episode which are never mentioned again: Lorelai's termites, Lane becoming a cheerleader. From S2 E12 we are back in the main Gilmore universe and all is returned to normal.

He wasnt informed about their engagement and much less an invitation to the wedding. And now Lorelai is offended because Sherry feels they dont have to be friends?? It annoys me soo much! 

He also calls her out at the end of the episode, when Lor gives her speech about finally letting Chris go after waiting years for him. 

Lorelai always needs to have the last word and be right, so I really enjoy here when shes speechless in both instances, since its obvious that was Chris is saying is right.

3. He talks down to Emily about her social events which are clearly very important to her. 

There are moments when Richard is understanding, like when he asks Lorelai to go on a date with a guy she met at an auction organized by Emily, because, ' you might not understand why it's important to her, I might not understand why it's important to her, but it is important to her.'

In general, I like Jess is better for Rory than the two other boyfriends.

Dean was a good boyfriend but they didnt have enough in common to be a long haul relationship. He would do things for her (book shopping, car building, etc) and she would do things for him (going to his games, letting him pick movies at the sacred movie nights, etc). They just werent made for each other and they could have been better friends than romantic partners. That way they wouldnt have had the couple obligations that put pressure on them.

Logan was really a fantastic guy for having fun and he understood Rory pretty damn well. The only problem is that he was very headstrong and daring whereas Rory needs to make pro/con lists about basically everything. Thats good for both of them at some parts when Logan convinced Rory to come out of her shell and when Rory makes Logan think about his actions, but his tendency to jump in with both feet made them less compatible than it seemed. At least, this difference would have caused a lot of relationship issues in the future.

Jess was not a perfect boyfriend by any means. He had too much on his mind to be a good boyfriend, especially at his age. He had abandonment issues from his father and then again from his mother when she just shipped him off because he was too much trouble. He probably got into a lot of trouble in New York and his friends most likely werent helping. He wasnt good at communicating, he was focused on his financial independence, his grades were plummeting, and all of this was leading to him not being good enough for the girl he was in love with. And on top of that an entire town of adult people hated him, not to mention the people his age. He had no friends and he got into a few fights, not leading me to think that he was anything but a pariah in and out of school. How could a 17 year old be trusted to put the care into a relationship when that was going on?

However, he grew up. He got his independence and he came back for his mothers wedding. He admitted to Luke that he needed him and that he appreciated him. He was a kid and he had so much weight on his shoulder and when that was lifted he fixed his own problems. When he wrote his book and moved to Philly, hed escaped the worst of his baggage. Not saying he was perfect, but he was independent, he was established, and he was confident. He had friends that would support him.

Now to the theory. So, Rory has graduated college and shes just lost her boyfriend. Shes grieving her relationship and the fact that she didnt get her New York Times internship. She would talk to Lorelai, obviously. But I imagine shed also reach out to Jess. Hed been in her life recently and hed just recently convinced her that she was good enough to be going for her dream job- why wouldnt she turn to him for reassurance?

Im imagining that they text on and off for a few weeks until Jess finally can wrangle her an interview (half because of his/his friends reputations and half because of Rorys Obama campaign coverage). Hed probably present it as something that wasnt that big of a deal, but something that she could totally depend on after the Obama campaign was over and she was out of a job.

So, its now the spring of 2008 and shes getting ready for her interview. Shes stressing out and trying to find a place to stay and a possible apartment (hotels are expensive but I cant afford an apartment in a city I might not live in!) and so Jess offers her his home office for a few nights while shes around. Its small and full of boxes but it has a pull out couch and a door that locks.

She stays for three days and she meets all of his friends and gets to really learn about the cool parts of Philly (courtesy of tour guide Jess). Then she goes to the interview (cue scene of Jess pumping her up because shes nervous) and absolutely slaughters it. She got the job!

She and Jess celebrate and she calls her mother, half drunk, and gushes about how shes excited, etc. Lorelais probably a little worried but they make plans to Skype and call all the time and Rory will come home at least once a month, most likely more.

Rory goes back to Stars Hollow to pack up while she apartment searches with Jesss help. She comes back to live with Jess for a little while because the apartment search is going crappily only to find

Hes transformed the home office into a bedroom (with adequate shelves for her book collection!) and says shes welcome to stay as long as she wants. She pays for utilities and food and then when his lease is up in 2 months and shes still living there, she moves in officially.

Theyre just friends up until the point that they realize that theyre actively not dating anyone else because it would feel like cheating.

Their friends are not surprised when they announce that theyre dating, much to their annoyance (its really embarrassment that they were that obvious and neither of them realized for months).

I am the kind of viewer that likes to have the show on in the background as I do chores around the house or am getting ready. I rarely actually sit down and watch it, but as background noise I find its familiarity soothing.

Anyhow, I am now nearing the end of season seven for the umpteenth time and I was wondering how you feel about the shows treatment of marriage. 

As you know, Lorelai was engaged to Luke and they split up. She marries Chris and they split up. 

Luke was engaged to Nicole and they split up. 

Dean was married to Lindsay and they split up (cough Rory cough). 

Miss Patty has had a number of marriages and Babette more than one. 

Even Richard and Emily briefly separate before renewing their vows.

Logan proposed to Rory who rejects the proposal, and Lane accepts one from Zac which appears premature, and which may not have been the best for her. 

It is interesting that there are few steady marriages depicted in the show, except perhaps for Sookie and Jackson. Id be interested on your thoughts about this. Is the show vaguely opposed to marriage or is it just overused as a plot device?

That got me thinking about the ""what if"" of Luke/Lorelai getting back together. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of Bon Voyage, Lorelai tells Rory that she's over Luke (she's clearly not, but still) and that she's decided they're better as friend. She's tired of waiting for him to make any decision. Luke swoops in with a big gesture of Rory's good-bye party and back together they go. 

But what if Rory didn't get the campaign job, they have the normal graduation party as planned, and Lorelai and Rory go on their roller coaster trip for a month. Would that month riding roller coasters (just being away from Stars Hollow) have solidified Lorelai's decision of not getting back together with Luke? 

&amp;#x200B;

I do see them ultimately getting back together, but without the massive good-bye party, I don't think it'd happen as easily. I guess to me, I could see Lorelai coming back and be open to finding new people to date and whatever, but I think any sign or gesture from Luke and she'd drop whomever she was with in a heartbeat and that'd be that. I do know that Luke would have to do it through some sort of big gesture because he'd be too scared/unable/unwilling to actually say anything since that's been his previous MO. Or he'd just seethe in quiet jealousy until he unleashes a massive ""I love you"" rant towards Lorelai.  Same vice versa if Luke ended up dating anyone else. I just think they're just too stuck on each other to really let the other one go.",2,4,False,self,,,,,

Straus is angry and yelling and Francine is hysterically crying and suggests to send Loreai ""away"", to which Emily gives a firm NO. Despite being upset Richard and Emily and willing to accept and help raise Rory with Lorelai. I think that if Straub and Francine had a daughter that got pregnant they would have been much less helpful.

I also think about Jason and his relationship with his parents. His father is the worst and when Jason disobeyed him his father was not only willing to sue him but also ended up leaving him with no job, no prospects, and no family. Comparing Richard and Emily to the Stiles makes them almost seem warm. If Lorelai had been born into the Stiles family and got pregnant and left I feel as though they would have cut her off and not even helped when she came asking for money for Chilton.

Then of course, we all have a hard time with Rory in AYiTL. 

I always think Rory isn't herself in both of these sections of Gilmore World. Another person mentioned they think this is the real Rory we're seeing. 

Upon further thought, I think they're right. 

During season 6 Rory is separated from Lorelai and from Stars Hollow and Yale. Three massive parts of her whole being: Mom, background, and academia. (During this time she still communicates with Paris. I think if Paris was also removed, Rory would be even farther from herself. 

Then, when she and Logan break up she's with Lorelai again.

With Lorelai, Rory is quiet, reserved, and serious. With little moments of joy peeking through. She adapts to her mother's personality.

With Dean, she sweet, bookish, and very careful. (He has a hard time keeping up, especially with Lorelai around.) . I sort of feel her holding back while she's with him. He's the ""perfect boyfriend"" so she tries to be the perfect girlfriend. Meanwhile, she can't see ""I love you"" back because she doesn't love him yet. She loves who she is when she's with him.

With Logan, she's the Lorelai that almost was. A little wilder, full of academics and much closer to the person her grandparents want her to be. (For this reason, I'm glad she didn't end up with Logan.)

With Jess: (I know hang in there with me.) I think this is the real Rory. I'm still in the midst of a rewatch so I haven't gotten to his episodes just yet. However, they amount they have in common with their likes, dislikes, and even a little of their upbringing. (Single parent who they felt they had to take care of a little.)

I also think Rory seems the most ""her"" when she's with him. He also helps her wake up several times throughout the series. ""Go back to Yale."" ""Write your story."" His what are you doing? Talks are always just what she needs. Not saying he's her soul mate.

It seemed that Lorelei never need to be an authority figure with Rory and at that moment it felt like she didn't have a clue how to handle it and Rory very much seemed to see it as a ""I don't have to justify my actions to you"".

Two kids who fall in love, chasing the dream, get married in a way that perfectly embodies who they are (a solemn Korean wedding, and then a rocking party afterwards), and then get to raise kids in the way that they want to! They get to be these two super cool parents, navigating the world together and growing through it together.

One of my favourite moments of the whole show is when Zack comes home and has to explain himself for buying name-brand stuff from the groceries, because they're trying to save money- and then when he finds out that Lane can't come with him on tour, without a second thought he decides not to go. They have such a wholesome, pure, loving relationship. Zack loves Lane, and Lane loves Zack- and they both support each other and respect each other. I also love how quickly Zack embraces Korean culture, and how respectful he is toward Mrs Kim even when she terrifies him.

I know lots of people hate Zack and wish Lane had gone on to tour the world but honestly-  I think her falling in love with one of her fellow band members, getting married at a Korean-Christian wedding, and raising two kids in whatever way she wants to is the perfect ending for her.

This happens on the morning of the first day of the test run. I remember Sookie's wedding day being May 15 because I'm getting married on May 15 next year, and I was pathetically happy that I was going to share my day with Sookie and Jackson.

&gt;*SOOKIE: ...Were getting married May fifteenth, four oclock, front lawn  pass it on.*

A few episodes before this one, though, they book their first reservation for the Dragonfly on May 8, and later, Lorelai tells her grandmother that they were going to have to rush to be open by then.

&gt;*LORELAI:  ...Our opening day is May 6th. \[pause\] May 8th and 9th, okay, great.*

If Sookie and Jackson did get married on May 15 as planned, and the test run is on May 15, then that means there's either a continuity error with the May 6th opening or they had to push back the opening date after all.

On my millionth rewatch, I just got to the episode where Dean confronts Jess right after the breakup where he's being a tough guy and standing up to Jess for really the first time. I know that it does come off a bit cringey but it's also the first real fire we've seen from Dean since Season 1. Unfortunately, other than him rekindling a friendship with Rory, there isn't really much of a truly unleashed Dean and the next we see him is the rebound gone out of control with Lindsay.

Does anyone else wish they had kept Dean single and had him try to do things to undermine the relationship with Jess? Or any other variation of what an unleashed and badass Dean would have been like? That could've made for a good plot thread through the end of Season 3 for Rory.  The fight at Kyle's party would have made a lot more sense with Dean defending Rory after the incident with Jess if he's single. Rory would complain to Dean about not being able to go to the prom and maybe Dean takes her instead as a ""friend"" but then Jess crashes prom, knowing Rory would be there to try to be there with her. They both attend her graduation but don't realize the other would be there. Could even be a good moment of character growth for Rory as she's tired of being caught between the two of them and in the season finale where she yells at both of them for being assholes in different ways and she's going to college, single, and that they've ruined the chance with her.

This could still end up playing the same way in season 4 and beyond but Rory feels like she can't turn to Dean even more because of the way they ended things and Jess really realizing he needs to grow up.

Ive held these things in for years because I didnt think anyone would get it but you guys seem understanding a fans complex relationship with the Girls

Whenever I watch Lorelai and Rory with Lane, my stomach clenches at how condescending they are toward her. In the episode where Lane stays at Rorys house after running her hand through her crushs hair, Lorelais advice was basically to invalidate Lane by reminding her that Lorelai was pregnant at 16 (as if Lane should just get over her humiliation because of Lorelais experience). It just seems like another way Lorelai turns things to herself. 

I also feel like they give Lane verbal head pats and forget shes even therethat scene with the Rocky Road Cookies felt so uncomfortable because once again, everyone was meant to just worship Rory.  They spent that episode making fun of Lanes hat, in a not-so-friendly way.

The way they talk to everyone around them just makes the disappointment revival make so much sense. All I could think of now is poor little rich girls. A few years ago I felt that same nostalgia watching it, but as Ive matured Ive really found them less sympathic. 

Ive seen others say they once idolized Rory/Lorelai and I felt the same! But every time I see how they speak to their friends, I want to turn it off. When Sookie was excited about her review (which then turned to disappointment), Sookie tried telling Lorelai how she makes her dish. Lorelai totally cut her off with a condescending the reviewer isnt here remark. It was meant to be funny but it comes off as extremely disrespectful. 

The only time I see Lorelai get called out is when she makes the remark about Sookies lack of dating life. This was the one scene where Lorelai was intentionally meant to be a jerk, but to me Im like wow seems like typical Lorelai. I loved when Max told her to stop thinking about herself! 

The other thing? I have a hard time suspending my disbelief that Lorelai bootstrapped her way up. She started as a privileged white girl. She didnt get questioned about her parenting choices and running away with a baby; she got respected and received near accolades. I often wonder how many other POC women do this but get reported. 

In terms of progressiveness, it was in some ways but as others commented, that praise for blue eyed babies was really uncomfortable.

Then theres Dean and Jess. Im always amused at the Teams for both, but I have to say, I find Dean overly defensive (In Chicago they call it pop, OKAY??!!) and Jess just obnoxious. I felt Jesss character tried way too hard to be that troubled teen, but he came off as a stereotype instead of a sympathetic character. I hated his attitude and how he and Rory got together. On a rewatch, I cringed so hard at how he handled her grandparents. I kept thinking, if he really  cared for Rory hed try a little harder.

The revival was really uncomfortable to watch and I could only barely manage it once. The pregnancy thing felt like such a cop out. As others have said, it would have made so much more sense if it was timed with the OS but it felt tacked on and like, So? Youre 32. You have a strong support network. Deal like your mom. I would have loved seeing an ending that wrapped things up instead of rushing things backward. 

That said, I love Emily. Yes, she spoiled Lorelai and Rory but honestly? She was privileged and wanted to give her daughter similar opportunities. She didnt pretend to be anything else like Lorelai tried. She wasnt perfect in any way, but I absolutely love her character!

Anyway, thanks for letting me rant! If I think of anything else Ill add it. I feel so much better hahah.
