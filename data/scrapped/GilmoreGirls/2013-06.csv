HOWEVER, Im in the middle of a re-watch and I have reached Welcome to the Dollhouse and frankly, I agree. 

Their relationship is a house of straw built on a foundation of sand. There were few substantial factors leading up to their relationship starting in the first place except that Logan was something new and exciting for Rory and that was it. He was a thrill. A rich, fun, rollercoaster of a relationship unlike Dean and Jess. And the main difference between Logan and Jess (as far as being a rollercoaster of a relationship) is M-O-N-A-Y! Logan has endless cash to whisk Rory away to New York or Asia or California and buy her all these fancy pants things like the Birkin bag or frivolous parties. 

I realize she was young and dumb and truly thoughtless and Im glad she learned from her mistakes. I just wish she wouldve realized how worthless he was sooner. ",0,1,False,default,,,,,

Im arrived at season six and Bridesmaids Revisited and you get high hopes towards the end because she finds out that Logan slept with Honors entire bridal party and breaks up with him because hes scum and not even five minutes later, in the very next episode SHE GETS BACK TOGETHER WITH HIM for god knows what reason! 

And then she tries to cheat on him and cant even follow through with that! 

And I got to thinking, is this the first time Rory didnt do what she said she would? NO! As a matter of fact its not. 

Season One: She disliked Donna Reed one second and the next second she pretends to be her to make up with Dean?

Season Two: The termites. She second guesses herself for visiting Jess in New York. 

Season Three: I wanna make things good with Dean? And, the biggest one yet, HARVARD?

Season Four: She was going to tell Lorelai about doing it for the first time AND DIDNT. Because she lost it to a married man! 

Season Five-Six-And-SEVEN: L-O-G-A-N! Their entire relationship. 

And, undoubtedly, a myriad of other actions she overthinks later that just have not come to mind yet. 

Not that I have a problem with overthinking things because if anyone is an overthinker, its me, but the manner in which her character does it is exceptionally irritating. 

Maybe its the lateness of the hour, maybe Im just a bitch, but you would think being raised by someone as stubborn and strong-willed as Lorelai wouldve rubbed off when it came to decision making.",0,2,False,self,,,,,

AND THIS IS WHY!

In this episode, Lorelai discovers that Rory is casually dating Logan which appalls her because Lorelai knows thats not the kind of girl Rory is. And when we were faced with the same situation and Jess, Rory riddled herself with guilt about going to a concert with a boy who ignored her for a weekend and proceeded to wig out about it. Which REALLY bothers me because while Jess and Logan have their problems as boyfriends, Jess genuinely loved Rory. He was merely incapable of expressing his feelings properly because he had never experienced them before. Logan on the other hand KNEW he would be a terrible boyfriend. He said it several times. And the only reason he decided he wouldve liked to be Rorys boyfriend was because he was afraid of losing her or some shit. He was selfish. He was disloyal. He made Rory feel awful about herself and do terrible things and he was not supportive and he didnt attempt to make her feel better about her life or reconsider her decisions. Jess, on the other hand, never drank with Rory or encouraged Rory to steal things. He understood that there was a consequence for everything because he was all alone. Unlike Logan who always always ALWAYS had his daddy to back him up and get him out of the sticky situations he throws himself into. Finally, Logans selfishness REALLY rears its ugly head at the very end of the series when Rory says she wont marry him and he just walks away. CLEARLY, he had expectations that Rory would willingly become a corporate wife which proves that he didnt know her or appreciate her company at all. In turn, Jess makes his life better. He runs a successful business, he has good friends, he remains well-read and interesting AND he wrote a published book for Rory.

Make a pro-con list and join me friends. Realize that Jess trumps Logan. Always and forever.

5,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2013-6-5,2013,6,5,2,1fnxci,self.GilmoreGirls,"Meanwhile, Gilmore Girls teaches us to love ourselves",https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fnxci/meanwhile_gilmore_girls_teaches_us_to_love/,al_mango3,1370367989,"Ive been chronologically reminding myself how much I love Gilmore Girls these past few months and I have reached Emily Says Hello (Season 5 Episode 9) and I have a few things I would like to say about Lane, Zach and Rory. 

I read all the time on starshollowconfessions  about how bad people feel that Lane didnt do more with her life. That she just wound up having twins at twenty-two with her fabulous husband and living in Stars Hollow with her band for the rest of her life really seems to upset people and I just want to ask why? Its a more existential question to pose based on my current personal experiences but I too have been wondering why people arent content with what they have. I understand having dreams and ambitions but, ultimately, if you wind up reaching some of your goals and at the end of the day you have a place you call home with people you love surrounding you and occupying your time, then why does it matter how you spend it? For example, I want to travel and see the world and live places like New York and Chicago and Portland and work at Pixar after my worldwide frolicking, but, if I were to move in with my friends tomorrow and live in Ohio forever, that wouldnt be SO bad. While I could do more, Im happy so why worry? Right? RIGHT! Lane never had high hopes to go places and do things like Rory. Lanes main goal from Seasons one through three was to take a stand and let her mother know who she was, whether Mrs. Kim liked it or not. And, eventually, very accidentally, she did. She wanted to play with the band. SHE DID. She was just a happy free person. She wasnt held back by Zach and the babies because she wanted to be a drummer and post-baby she kept on kicking. She had her life and her friends and her bandmates and babies and she was completely happy and, presumably, still living out her happy Stars Hollow life in Amy Sherman-Palladinos and every superfans mind! And Rory got to work on the campaign trail with Barack Obama. She lived her dream and did what she wanted and traveled and saw the world. 

I just find it kind of snotty and presumptuous to say that Lane got trapped in Stars Hollow. Because Lane was happy. Just because someone out there doesnt want to live in Stars Hollow and be married to Zach doesnt mean that Amy hadnt intended for Lane to wind up like that anyway. She wasnt a soccer mom, she was a cool mom, like Lorelai. She was cultured and interesting and well-rounded and, FRANKLY, any kid would be lucky to grow up in such a safe town with such great parents and eccentric family friends. Lane and Zach had a great support group and I would applaud any friend of mine that could say they had a whole town behind them watching out for their kids and helping them grow up into quirky, respectable men. 

The bottom line is: It doesnt matter what you do or when you do it or who you do it with because were all going to die someday and eventually everything you worked for will probably be completely irrelevant. But if you can be happy and leave some small lasting impression on this world, then thats what counts.

6,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2013-6-5,2013,6,5,14,1fpebd,self.GilmoreGirls,SO! I'm gonna talk about Jess Mariano,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fpebd/so_im_gonna_talk_about_jess_mariano/,al_mango3,1370410854,"Ive been embarking on some pretty extensive Gilmore Girls marathons and Ive reached Say Goodnight, Gracie and I just wanted to rant a little about all the flack Jess gets for being a terrible person. 

In this episode we meet Jess dad who is a screwed up individual that left Jess when he was a baby to be stuck with this whack-a-doo alcoholic mother in the big broad New York. Before Jess moved to Stars Hollow he was alone. There was no one who cared about him and no one he cared about and its a fact that people are a product of their environment, for better or for worse and the greater portion of Jess life up until he was seventeen was for worse. 

I just wanted to say that I think people dont give Jess enough credit for becoming a much better person than he initially was when we met him. 

Also, I think people are too judgmental about the way he treats Rory in Keg! Max! He finds out that hes not graduating high school when he knows hes smart enough to because he didnt apply himself while he was busy trying to make money to have a future elsewhere and then hes got his perfect valedictorian girlfriend that he doesnt feel good enough for running around talking about all the things he never can or will do and hes ashamed to tell her hes not graduating and he cant take her to prom. He tries to explain himself but she winds up crying to Dean which just makes Jess more upset because on top of everything else hes going through hes constantly being compared to this Simpleton Jackass. 

Anyway, I just think people should take a more in-depth look at this kid from the wrong side of the tracks.

7,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2013-6-6,2013,6,6,2,1fqemv,self.GilmoreGirls,Literati Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fqemv/literati_thoughts/,al_mango3,1370453471,"SO! Someone recently submitted a confession to http://starshollowconfessions.tumblr.com/ about how they wouldve liked for Rory to sleep with Jess when she went to Philadelphia and Im here to talk about it (because I have nothing better to do while I wait for The Daily Show). 

WHILE I tout myself captain of the literati ship, I wouldve had a problem with Rory and Jess sleeping together in Philadelphia AND HERES WHY:

It wouldve ruined everything myself and my faithful shipmates have that made Rory and Jess so special. Kind of the way sleeping with Dean made their relationship horrible. Because before Rory and Dean slept together, their relationship (in the first season) was adorable and innocent and just downright perfect as far as first relationships for characters go. BUT! After Dean became skeezy and cheated on his wife and Rory didnt give a shit about the hell she was stirring up and proceeded to sleep with him and have a newfound relationship with farmboy that was based on foul pretenses, their relationship was SOILED. AWFUL. RUINED. Especially when you re-watch the series, because I know that after all is said and done and I think AWE! Theyre so cute at the beginning I just have this gross feeling that tells me Lettuce not forget: THEY LOSE IT TO EACH OTHER WHILE DEAN IS MARRIED. And then I just get grossed out, but thats just me. ANYWHO: Had Jess and Rory undergone the same sneaky, underhanded, bad episode of Cheaters sex-fest while she was in Philadelphia it wouldve made everything less special and I know I wouldnt feel the same way about their relationship if they had. Because I already have a beef with the way Rory treated Jess (as you can read about here) but had she slept with him just to get back at Logan (which was her intention, or so it seems the way she says I cant do this to Jess) I wouldve lost the little faith I had in the end that they would wind up together. SO! I guess all Im trying to say is, I will always firmly believe that somewhere in the future Jess and Rory got married and lived in New York as writers/bookstore owners and if muh girl Amy Sherman-Palladino had written in a sex scene between the two characters I wouldve looked to the future while re-watching and thought to myself Lettuce not forget: THEY SLEEP TOGETHER SO RORY CAN GET BACK AT LOGAN which would imply that Rory didnt actually care about him as much as I like to believe. And, had she written one in, that wouldve displayed an incredibly immature side that we know Rory had based on her leaving school and not talking to Lorelai and throwing her life away blah blah blah. And I think by excluding it and making Rory question her motives we see both that she has grown as a person AND that she actually cares about Jess and cant bring herself to use him as a pawn. 

In conclusion, Im glad they didnt have sex. Especially, at his last appearance on the show EVER. ",1,0,False,self,,,,,
8,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2013-6-6,2013,6,6,15,1fry90,self.GilmoreGirls,Can we talk for a second about how much I hate Rory for being such a jerk to Jess during and AFTER their relationship?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fry90/can_we_talk_for_a_second_about_how_much_i_hate/,al_mango3,1370499888,"So first, she fucks with Dean (who I hate but whatevs) and she plays ping-pong with his feelings AND Jess. 

Then when she finally gets dumped by Dean and gets together with Jess, she treats Jess like some kind of criminal because hes not as perfect as Dean. She always has him on trial and shes constantly comparing him to Dean. And Jess really wanted to be with her because he loved her. Rory, however, just liked him a lot because he attracted her mentally and physically in ways Dean didnt. 

So he leaves, they break up and they dont talk for a year. 

THEN! Rory gets mad at him for blowing her off when he floats back in to town. As if she actually wants to talk to him. And then when he tries to talk to her SHE YELLS! So he wigs out and runs away again. 

And then he comes back and wants to talk to her and what does she do? INTERRUPTS! She doesnt let him say what he wants in a calm rational way. He just rambles and cries and she says No and cries and then he runs away AGAIN!

AND THEN! He comes back to tell her how important she was as a mature adult. So she takes him out with her doucebag boyfriend who insults him and she says next to nothing the entire time! 

AND FINALLY! Their last moment together is Rory manipulating his feelings, yet again, to get back at her douchey boyfriend who humiliated the only guy who ever actually loved her because she loves him? Riddle me THAT, Batman! 

They are my OTP because theyre perfect for each other but during their time together and apart Rory just does some things that really infuriate me and PROVE she is like Lorelai because she doesnt know when shes really in love with someone.
