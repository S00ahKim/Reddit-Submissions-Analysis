3,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2016-12-1,2016,12,1,9,5ftgym,self.GilmoreGirls,[REVIVAL SPOILERS] Amy is Rory in 2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5ftgym/revival_spoilers_amy_is_rory_in_2016/,Lavidacraycray,1480553367,"So I've been seeing a few people comparing Amy to Lorelai - a magical pop-culture-quoting unicorn free spirit who everyone just looooooves, but part of me wonders if Amy has unwittingly written all of her negative traits into 2016's RORY.  Basically, she has gone full circle by writing herself into the Rory that we have all grown to dislike. 

Rory in 2016 - bad journalist, no initiative, entitled, no empathy, and no regard for how her actions affect others. 

Amy: All of the above.

Let me begin: 

I think we've all established that Rory is a lackluster journalist who wouldn't know how to take a unique angle if it smashed her in the face/line. We've seen zero evidence that she's a good writer, other than a couple of pieces in 3 good publications in a decade.

And you know who else is a bad writer? Amy. 

Who wrote the letter to Emily? What happened to the sewers, and why was that plot there?  (also Stars Hollow already HAS sewers!). Why did Paris miss her period? Why did Christopher become the baddie in a Marvell movie? Did anyone find the poor old forgettable Paul storyline funny? Why is anyone friends with Rory when she's an unbelievable jerk - she never asks a single one of her friends how they are before launching into her whines!

And lack of initiative. Rory. Rory Rory Rory. You see a bunch of people lining up for nothing and you just walk on by? Dafuq is wrong with you? That's a story waiting on a silver platter! 

And Amy! Lorelai and Luke have just 'never talked about kids'. In 9 years? This is Lorelai verbal diarrhea Gilmore. Oh COME ON. There is no freaken way it just 'never came up'. Here's a couple of ways you could have shoe-horned that (total waste of time) plot in a way that made sense - Lorelai and Luke struggled to get pregnant and it's their last chance so they're trying surrogacy. Lorelai sees a beautiful baby on one of her Lifetime movies and gets clucky and henpecks Luke into it. Paris comes to visit after her divorce and tells Luke he'd be a great donor and they get hustled into the clinic. Bam - didn't even break a sweat! 

Onwards, to entitlement. Rory is 'broke' and yet flies back and forth from London in search of her lucky red dress (which by the way, looks like crap). She yells at an interviewer for daring to ask what kind of pieces she'd be writing, and then tops it off by some petty shouting about the office decor. Rory wants to write a book about Lorelai and her life raising Rory because it's either that, postgrad, or a 'job she doesn't like'. Oh, the horror!! 

But there's someone else who's giving off a little whiff of entitlement. Our friend, Amy. 

Amy absolutely refused to watch season 7. Not one scene of it. Didn't even deign to read the script. She just wrote the revival and then checked with 'superfans' (millennials that she then proceeded to shit all over with the super unfunny '30s club') to see if that gelled with season 7. And even if it didn't, she just ignored it anyway, like how Logan is now working for Mitchum's empire - despite his big move to cut the apron strings to work for something he's passionate about and make his own way in the world. 

How arrogant and dismissive of the fanbase do you have to be to not even watch the final season when MILLIONS of people take that ending and character development as a given? How much of a raging dick do you have to be to just completely undo any growth your characters have shown -Logan was NOT a one dimensional shit weasel even at the end of season 6! He had a spine and even ole Mitchum respected him for standing up to him - Logan would never have married for the 'dynasty!'. Rory was super organised and a hustler! And team Jess fans deserved better - JESS deserves more than being a wise sage waiting in the wings and pining over a wishy washy socialite he dated for a few months when he was 15!

You know what would have been great? If Amy had honoured her fans, watched the season, and did what a good writer should do regardless of personal feelings -written a story that got her from point A to B without just completely rewriting characters and putting them into situations that made zero sense.

And then the musical. That old chestnut. How tone deaf and entitled to you have to be to indulge in some shit, unfunny, musical for 20 bajillion years,  featuring some non-Stars Hollows rando from your obscure cancelled show - seriously what WAS that? Why did we need to sit through all of that to make some weak point about Lorelai having a mid life crisis.

And then the worst part of all - Amy's biggest writerly failing (in my opinion) - the full circle plot device so she could cram her precious four words in. I just don't understand why she was so set on it. Like, what is she trying to say with that? I get the 'we all repeat our parent's path' (although I don't agree). But - and then what? What are we supposed to take from that? You can be given every opportunity in life, and then Amy is still going to paint you into a corner, and you're going to end up homeless and pregnant and SURPRISE! Full freaken circle!

Unless Amy was planning on trolling the networks with that ending to get a new series so we can see everyone rally around to support Rory (although I'd argue that Lorelai actually had it pretty damn good  with Emily and the Independence Inn and Stars Hollow), then I can't see why we invested all that time watching Lorelai et al doing everything they could to see Rory flourish, if the plan was just to get her pregnant and stuck in Stars Hollow in the end, even if the season had ended when she was 17.

Apparently the Gilmore girls destiny is to have babies and find fulfillment that way. Not through careers or making it in the world, but through mother-daughter relationships. 

Like that's ok, I guess, I just don't really see why we all got taken for that ride if the lesson was 'and we all learnt nothing, you can't change your future'. What IS the lesson we're supposed to take from this?

Your parents can be overbearing and hella rich, and you'll wind up pregnant, but they can also be your friend and you'll still fuck up? Permissive parenting and praise is bad? Money is bad? Having babies DOESN'T muck your life up? You can learn from the mistakes you made with your kid, because your grandkids will repeat the mistakes their parents made? History just repeats over and over again, and you and your high school love interests are locked into having to repeat the same patterns over and over again because no one ever learns from their parents lives? 

I feel like we got punked.

Basically, all I'm taking away from this is that we all owe the season 7 director a big apology. 

TLDR - Amy is petty and entitled and a bad writer and I think she has poured all of that into Rory. Basically, she has gone full circle.",42,100,False,self,,,,,

-In 1x07, when Lorelai is spying on Dean after she finds out about Rory and his kiss, she says to Luke, ""he looks like Christopher.""
-In 1x09, after the whole falling asleep at Patty's incident, Emily says to Lorelai, ""she'll get pregnant, you know."" And Lorelai says a whole speech defending Rory and saying she's not like her (pretty bleak when we consider AYTL's ending...)
-In 2x01 when Rory brings Dean to her grandparents' dinner, Richard is generally awful to Dean. Afterward, Lorelai tells Rory that Richard is probably just scared that a boy will ruin Rory's future and make her end up like Lorelai
-In 1x16, Dean infamously says the whole ""you don't get pregnant saying I love you"" line
... Now, obviously it's not a perfect parallel. Dean isn't from the same rich, privileged world Christopher is. But I do remember ASP saying they'd had more plans for Dean, but they wrote him out because of Supernatural. What do you guys think?",3,7,False,self,,,,,

Don't kill me Logan Shippers, but I don't think the affair Rory and Logan were having proves they're in love and destined to be the next Emily and Richard.  

Rory was a complete mess in the entire revival.  She was failing at her career, was pretty much homeless, and just seemed to be struggling with who she was and what she wanted to do with herself.  I think when Logan and her reconnected in London had nothing to do with it being Logan and her not being over him.  I think she was just in a bad place and lost and Logan just happened to be there so she latched on and began this toxic obsession with him using him as a kind of security blanket.  

If Dean had been in London at that time and not Logan, she probably would've seduced him again.  Same with Jess, same with any guy in a Wookie costume.  It had nothing to do with Logan or her ""love"" for him, he just happened to be there in her time of need.  

It ended up being a long term affair, because Logan too was in a bad place in his life.  He's never liked carrying on his family legacy and he clearly didn't want to marry Odette.  So Rory just happened to be in London all insecure and Logan was feeling insecure in his life so they latched onto each other using each other as like these toxic escapes from their lives they were unhappy in.

I remember noting a change of tone when seasons 5 and 6 aired - I felt like the magic and coziness was gone. I still watched, enjoyed parts, but I didn't hold it very dear to my heart.

By now we know that that shift was somewhat intentional - in [this interview](http://collider.com/amy-sherman-palladino-dan-palladino-gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-interview/) Amy says, ""I always felt like the underlying thing about Gilmore was that, if you happened to be born into a family that doesnt really understand you, go out and make your own. Thats what Lorelai did. She went out and she made her own family. **The ironic twist in her life is that then this daughter that she created this whole family for, likes the family that she left.** It was a cycle of crazy family.""

She meant for there to be irony, for there to be disruptive change. But it's strange to me that the show feels *so different*. The theme of Rory wanting the life Lorelai left behind is introduced as early on as season 1, when she enjoys being at the club with Richard - but it doesn't feel jarring or uncomfortable when I rewatch. I can't imagine a group like the Life and Death Brigade existing in the early seasons. (Though, I guess Chilton had Francie and the Puffs...)

Is it because Rory is so young, and still so firmly under Lorelai's wing? Is it because the video is grainy and warmer? Did the creators change personally and drastically from beginning to end, or did they just have less freedom back when the show was new? Maybe the WB was trying to mold a friendlier, more accessible show?

I'm just speculating - would love to hear others' thoughts. Maybe the tone didn't change as much as I think it did, and it's just my own nostalgia coloring my opinion!

what did some of you expect, exactly?

As the 90 minute uninterrupted seasonal format would inherently indicate, ""A Year in the Life"" is not ""Gilmore Girls.""  

By design, it was always going to be a darker, transition year for the girls and the show itself due to the significant real and fictional losses that force the show to deal with in a way the original run never did.

Richard just died, Sookie is gone, and Lorelai, Rory and Emily are all adjusting to things beyond their control, their own life and how it affects things going forward in arguably the most significant ways since the first episode. 

That's not to say there aren't valid complaints regarding the writing and whatnot, but to take issue with the fact that the show is darker is just silly when it was a core of the show that bubbled underneath everything warm.

To us, they've always seemed like very different people. Lorelei hardly agrees with Rory's choices anymore, but doesn't really comment on any of since Rory seems to throw a fit everytime someone questions her or doubts her.

To me, she seems a lot like Christopher. In the revival, it was re-established that he spent all the years while Rory was growing up chasing a dream of being a big-shot businessman, never settling to work at a smaller company or settling for his dynastic plan (other than the moments of doubt when he was 16 and he'd just become a father, and also much later, when Gigi was born). It always seemed to me that Chris was coasting by on his parents' money while he chased the high-living life on his own terms, and that seems like exactly what Rory's been doing these past ten years, albeit on her grandparents' money (and I'm sure, with her mother's help as well).
Just looking back on Rory's big, pivotal decisions over the years, it seems a lot like as she grew up and experienced the seemingly endless wallet of her grandparents, she incorporated herself into the rich life and it really seemed like that was where she fit in best. She struggled figuring that out (and I definitely don't think has admitted it to herself yet), but I feel like she really mirrors Christopher. More things: Christopher would always blaze into Lorelei's life when he needed help, stick around for a day or two and have a lot of sex, and then something would come up and he'd be outta there. Seems a lot like her set up with Logan.

Another thing - if Rory is Chris, I feel like Logan parallels Lorelei. Of course, Lorelei broke away from and left the plan her own parents had set out for her, but I feel like a huge part of that was catalysed by her pregnancy. Leading up to the pregnancy, she acted a lot like the way Logan did back in uni - partying, weed, drinking, and blowing through the family money just because he could. I'm really disappointed with the way Logan managed to stay connected to the family money, because I personally thought that at the end of season 7, he would've chased his own dreams and made a business for himself. But, anyway, he ended up back under his parent's thumb which we all know Lorelei wouldn't do unless it was something for Rory.

Anyway, thinking about the whole full circle has made a lot more sense to me when I thought of Rory as a parallel to Chris, and Logan to Lorelei. Pretty sure that's not what ASP was intending, though, I really don't think that if there were a continuation, she would have the baby be raised by Logan while Rory gallivanted around the globe. But, I feel like that's a much more likely situation than Logan not trying to be immensely involved in the child's life. And - this shed a whole new light on Rory's conversation with Chris in Fall for me.",41,103,False,self,,,,,

Now, there have been a lot of comments about Rory's flailing journalistic career, but the revival ends on positive note. She realizes that its not right for her, Jess inspires her to write about her life with her mother and Rory is starting anew. Presumably, writing a book about her life is a way to get it back on track and find something meaningful and fulfilling to do. But is it, though? Or is it just going to be a vanity publication - ending with its highest sales in Stars Hollow because everyone wanted to read themselves in it?

A) Obviously, its going to be a thinly veiled autobiography. Except, you write an autobiography after you've led an interesting and meaningful life. Rory's life has been pretty bland. She had a pretty normal childhood, loved by everyone, she had privilege and money, she had her shares of successes and failures, her share of romances - and that's about it. Nothing markedly significant or earth-shattering. Any reason why people would want to read that?

B) A tv-show is not a book. There are plenty of things that worked for the show - fast paced dialogue, great visuals, nuanced acting - all the stuff you can't put in a book. Would people be really interested in reading the dialogue instead of listening to it? 

C) I can imagine Rory thinking that she is writing about her life in the vein of classic novels - like Dickens or Austen. But again, her life-story is nowhere near that complicated or intriguing. Nor, do I imagine, is her actual writing. While everyone keeps saying that she is a great writer, I haven't seen anything from her that puts her above your average novelist. 

D) A novel in this day and age? When every other person has his own blog, livejournal or podcast? If she thought being a journalist was too hard in the time when print media was dying, can you imagine being a novelist? 

E) Is she suited to be writer at all? One of Rory's major character flaws is how poorly she handles criticism. But handling criticism and rejection is a major part of any writer's life. How would she deal with it when one publisher after another rejects her book? Well, no matter - Jess owns a publishing business and she has money - so sure, she can get the book published. Then how would she handle critics panning her book in one review after another? Would there be a montage of Lorelai and Luke buying up every newspaper in town so that Rory doesn't see the negative reviews?

F) Even if she succeeds, is this supposed to be her full potential? Throughout the original series, everyone kept talking about how Rory had a bright future and was going to leave her mark on the world. The idea of her traveling the world as a journalist - exposing political corruption, bringing up social issues, writing about injustices and so on fit with that. The idea of giving up and 32 and writing a novel about her life after moving back home does not. I mean - even if her book succeeds, can we imagine it inspiring generations of young girls? Can we imagine it being discussed in literature classes for its themes and nuances while being assigned as summer reading? I can't. 

G) But maybe writing the book isn't her ending at all - you say. Maybe she'll find herself and go back to being a kickass journalist. Maybe she'll grow the gazette into a national syndicate. Maybe she'll become a spectacular novelist - churning one bestseller after another with studios after her for the movie rights. 

Except, this was the ending we were given. Regardless of what we want to happen or how we want her to grow, we are supposed to assume that this is going to be the course of her life. She'll be a moderately successful novelist with her mother's, grandmother's and Jess' support. She'll raise her daughter like she was raised. And she'd go on living your average life. That is what fits with ASP's ""cycle of life"" view - so that is what we should assume is going to happen. 

But is that it? Is that how the great Rory Gilmore is supposed to end up? Is that what's left of all the ""change the world"" aspirations? That's a let-down, to say the least. 

TL;DR?
Writing a novel about yourself without having any significant achievements seems like just a vanity project. Rory's temperament isn't suited to be an author to begin with. And even if she is successful at it, by the standards of the dreams and ambitions of her younger self, she still ends up being a failure. 

All in all, it seems like a bad idea. Thoughts?

My theory is that the reason there were so many long and pointless scenes were because we had already been told we'd be getting 4 90 minute episodes before the shooting even started, so Amy needed filler once the scenes she originally imagined wouldn't work due to schedules.

Scenes that felt like they went missing or had issues off the top of my head:

1) Who wrote the letter? Cut. But why THE HELL didn't they reshoot the therapy scene? 

2) The screw up that was the scheduling of the scene of family/friends at the wedding. Really, Lane who is barely in the Revival but no Emily? Why wasn't Emily staying at the Dragonfly that night? Nantucket isn't that close to Stars Hollow, and I doubt even the new relaxed Emily wouldn't want to have to fly in right before the wedding rather than stay over.

3) Anyone notice that when Brian comes in for band practice there's an exchange about whether he needs to crash there? What the hell was his story? Does he live far away? Is he another vagabond? Is he fighting with a spouse?

4) Was that really Jess's intended storyline?

5) Why was the Chris scene shot so weirdly? Was there another version that may have put those final four words in another light?

6) Was there anything else to the sewer storyline?

I feel like this was put together in a sloppy, rushed manner and that everyone being spread far and wide for scheduling really didn't help. But I'm also guessing that there were scenes that ASP stubbornly left in when she should have reshot (AKA, the dropped letter) while in other ways it feels like she tried to make changes as she went that resulted in almost the entire 6 hours feeling incredibly lacking in actual substance and feeling like a cobbled together mess.

I've watched it twice now (skipping the musical the second time, of course) and the second rewatch is worst than the first because it doesn't even have nostalgia going for it. Without giving a shit about Rory's love life to cloud my judgement, this was a poorly structured set of TV movies.

It's like ASP specifically told the story this way to make sure everybody would tune in for the next installment of the series. On its own many of the subplots make no sense (like Lorelai and Luke considering surrogacy, or the musical) but they could be the foundation for the next 'Season'.

Anyway, I'd like to share my theory on Rory's arc in the original series and how it relates to the revival.

Full disclosure: I am far from a Gilmore Girls expert. I've seen a number of episodes (my girlfriend watched it nonstop for a while), but I feel like I have an ok grasp of the overall feel of the show. Having said that, if I say something that's completely impossible based on something in the show I haven't seen or have forgotten, feel free to tell me but please be nice. :) 

Ok, so what if what we saw in the original run of the show is actually Rory's memoir? I found Rory's character in the revival to be somewhat at odds with who she seemed to be in the original series. Originally, she seemed relatively driven, principled, level-headed, and interested in doing the right thing. (Although I understand there was an instance where she was the other woman for a hot second in the original series, but she wasn't proud of that, right? She was remorseful, yes? This is a potentially weak point in my theory, so I defer to the knowledge of more devoted fans. Perhaps this could be explained by ASP absence or something? Somebody help me out on this!) What if that sort of bright-eyed, innocent do-gooder that we came to know and love in the original series is how Rory remembers herself now that she's 32 and has had much less success than she hoped she would have? What if the picturesque magic of Stars Hollow and the rest of her life is actually just a mythical version of her younger years that she  unconsciously invented to make sense and meaning out of where/who she is now? And now she's writing this memoir, which turns into the literary version of the show we watched.

I think it's totally possible that Rory's transition from bright kid with the whole world ahead of her to mediocre hot mess is meant to convey that she is actually just a normal person with flaws just like everyone else, and that life is hard and eventually makes hot messes of us all. That's cool. But I think it's much more interesting if all those warm, fuzzy years we watched Rory live were not objective representations of Rory's real life, but were Rory's memories, filtered through her subsequent experiences and failures. 

Again, this is kind of a working theory, but I'd love y'all's thoughts and whatnot. ",4,8,False,self,,,,,
64,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2016-12-2,2016,12,2,4,5fyqk2,self.GilmoreGirls,[Revival Spoilers] Paris' storyline was damn near perfect.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5fyqk2/revival_spoilers_paris_storyline_was_damn_near/,AppleAddict,1480622069,"The update on Paris' life was probably my favorite part of the revival, even though she wasn't my favorite in the OS. Besides Liza Weil's spot-on performance, her life situation in the revival was the most realistic for many reasons. 

Divorce: It's a sad situation, but can you imagine being married to Paris? Love can stand up to a lot, but being married to somebody that intense and insecure would be draining. I completely buy that Doyle would want a more relaxed lifestyle after over a decade of Paris as his SO, she'd burn anybody out. I also believe that Paris is ruthless enough to cut Doyle out of her life if he no longer fit how she imagined her life. She's never been one to let emotions guide her decisions. She broke up with Doyle in college when she feared him derailing her, she would absolutely consent to a divorce if she felt he actually was.

Motherhood: Though I didn't like the ""circle of life"" theme, Paris as a mother played into it directly and nearly. Her children love the nanny more than they love her. This is the same situation Paris experienced growing up. It was her nanny that attended her graduation, and her nanny moving out of the country is what inspired her to get a life coach. When her parents fled he country she cared more about her finances then not being able to see them. Paris is the same type of mother as her mother. She never could have been anything but, she's not a maternal person. 

Career: As just started, Paris never had a warm
and fuzzy family. I can see that guiding her to being a fertility doctor, wanting to help families who desperately want children find that warm fuzzy happiness. But there's also the extremely logical majority of her that would realize that there's buku bucks in that industry. People are not logical about family, so they'd be willing to pay through the nose for her services. Paris' detachment with people also allows her to move the surrogates, sperm, and couples around like product. Though this isn't particularly nice, it would make her services highly efficient and effective, making her the best in the biz.

Bathroom Freakout: Though I hate that this amazing scene was inspired by a quick glimpse of her childhood crush, (Paris is too mature to panic about a man she hasn't seen in 15 years), it added a lot to her character. It reminded us that her amazing accomplishments are not just because she's brilliant, but in part because she's deeply insecure. She'll never feel enough. Her accomplishments are like her briefcase - fancy and impressive, but empty. It also showed that, despite pretending her divorce doesn't bother her much, she's experiencing a lot of stress and sadness over it. Missing your period is a sign of high stress, so clearly she's very sad about her relationship with Doyle. Hopefully she'll feel secure one day, but she would not have come this far if she had self-confidence. 


Where Paris is at in AYITL isn't necessarily cheery, but I thought it was so, SO real. Everything she did was completely in line with the person she has always been. I absolutely loved it. ",14,22,False,self,,,,,

She isn't very into following every bit of news, even though she loved the series from when it first aired here. She said to me ""at least he didn't die for real""

I'm struggling on deciding when to tell her. Perhaps after we watch the other 3 specials, as not to upset her too much (most people have had time to react to the news). Do the other episodes tug the heartstrings about Richard a lot?

(And obsessively rewatching. And reading every review. And calling my friends to discuss it. I have a problem; I'm glad you guys understand, lol.) 

I loved the revival. Loved, loved, loved it. I thought it was imperfect, but not in any way that made me not enjoy it. (And I loved it even more on a rewatch; I didn't have the ""BUT WHAT IF IT SUCKS"" terror in the back of my mind, so it let me just relax and enjoy it more.) Honestly, I think it was about as perfect as I could have hoped for.

There's a few complaints I keep seeing on here, and I figured I'd write my own thoughts in one long post.

I want to make it super clear these are just my opinions. I'm not saying anyone is wrong, or I'm definitely right, or anything like that. I just wanted to share some more positive interpretations of the show. (The negativity is bumming me out a bit, and I'm trying to hold onto any positivity as long as I can lately, with everything that's happened in the news in the past month.) Clearly ASP enjoys an open-ended show, and I really love how many different interpretations and opinions that allows.

(Also, obviously, **massive revival spoilers below!**)

**On the musical**. 

I agree that this went on too long, but I think it was better for ASP to err on the side of too long vs. too short. I think it **had** to be long, annoying, and painful. I don't think it was pointless, or didn't serve the plot. I think it was used to show that Lorelai has, in some ways, outgrown the town. I think it emphasized how stuck she feels, how much she's standing still. Since Rory is grown, she can finally focus on her own dreams, and I think she's realizing they're bigger than the Dragonfly and slying mocking the townies. I think we were supposed to feel as frustrated and stuck and bored as Lorelai. I really think this is when it starts clicking for her that everything she currently has isn't enough. If it hadn't been for the musical, and disagreeing so much with the advisory committee, I'm not sure she would have expanded the Dragonfly and decided to invest more in herself. 

Again, I do think it went on too long, but only slightly (and honestly, I really am okay with the length). I think if it had been shorter or more spread out, it would have felt like a one-off joke rather than a big character changing moment. The ""Never or Now"" song maybe could have still expressed it enough after a shorter musical sequence, but I don't think it would have gotten across the whole point quite as strongly - I think we needed to see why she was suffering and how out of step she felt with the town.

**On Logan ""not"" following season 7** 

I've seen a ton of people saying Logan's character growth was annihilated and that ASP must have ignored his changes in season 7 entirely. I think that Logan's current situation makes perfect sense, considering the events of season 7. 

He did stand up to his father and his family, but only once he was with Rory. After she turned down his proposal, I think he gave up. For all we know, his job in Frisco may have failed (or he may have never even taken it), and I could easily see him being broken enough to go back with his family and do whatever they wanted. He was always a character who was balancing between breaking away and being completely, tragically fatalistic. I think losing Rory at the end of season 7 pushed him in the tragic direction completely.

I have little doubt that Rory is the one who set up the current relationship arrangement, and I don't he would push her to commit to him, for fear of losing her all over again. He didn't fight her ""breaking up"" with him in the revival (and made it clear when he came to properly say goodbye and cheer her up that it didn't have to be sexual, which I really loved), he never did more than hint that he'd be all hers if she'd have him. I think he was taking whatever scrap of happiness he could get. I think she fully broke him.

**On the spa expansion not following season 7** 

Similar to Logan, I didn't think this ignored season 7; I felt like it built from it beautifully. I think Lorelai remembered her mom suggesting it, and being willing to help expand the inn. When Michel brought it up, I think Lorelai was in a place to finally admit that it was a good idea.

I think her not bringing it up negatively when asking her mom for help, and Emily not bringing up that it was her idea originally, were both really love showcases of how far they've come. They're not harping on the past, they're not fighting over who should get credit for something, they're not bragging. I think Emily knows she helped spark the idea, and she's just letting Lorelai have this. And Lorelai is be gracious about it. (Honestly, I can even see Lorelai asking her mom for her input, once she starts planning the spa, since it was her idea originally.) I think it shows how much less bitterness is there. Even their arrangement to come to Nantucket twice a year felt like it was made partly for nostalgia's sake - like they were playing with each other. I loved it so much

**On the 30-Something Gang**

Honestly, as a 32 year old who's career is floundering and who's friends all are struggling, I found his hysterical. I didn't view it as a ""those damn millennial"" stab (although I definitely did feel a lot of anti-millennial jokes in the revival). I didn't get the impression that ASP felt like their failure was their own fault (although their parents certainly thought so, but I found that attitude realistic - a lot of millenials' parents do think that way, and I think she was making fun of that, not necessarily agreeing with what they were saying about their kids). I felt like the 30-somethings were all on the verge of hysterical due to their circumstances (hence their doing things like reenacting movies), and I found it VERY relatable and amusing. It felt like a dig, but not an insult, if that makes sense? Just kind of a ""yeah, a lot of your lives suck and you're trying to not go crazy."" 

**Rory's career being dead**

This reaction surprises me the most. As someone who grew up idolizing Christiane Amanpour and then realized I actually wanted to be a fiction/creative non-fiction writer, I spent most of the OS screaming at Rory ""WHY ARE YOU GOING FOR JOURNALISM WHEN FICTION IS OBVIOUSLY YOUR PASSION? WRITE A DAMN BOOK, ALREADY."" I felt like she was trying to push herself into journalism, partly to be the type of person that her mother wanted her to be, and I think it took failing at journalism for her to see what she wants for herself, what her actual dreams are. 

(I also think her failing at journalism was a sign that it's not her true passion. It's definitely hard to make it as a journalist right now, and that was accurately shown, but she just shot herself in the foot so many times. It was clear that she just didn't care enough about it to put the work in.)

I know Amy has left it open if her book succeeds, but I have a lot of faith that it does. I think creative non-fiction is the PERFECT fit for Rory, personality, skill, and experience-wise. I squealed for her when she figured it out - it felt incredibly satisfying to me, and I ended the revival feeling incredibly optimistic about her career. I don't think she ended the revival as a failure at all; I think she ended as someone who has finally found themselves and what makes them happy - not their mother or their grandmother happy.

**A baby means the ends of Rory's life** 

I've been a bit surprised by this attitude as well. I know Rory is scared and confused, but I don't think that this means her life is over by any means, or that she's now stuck or has to give up her career. For one thing, ASP has made it clear since the revival that Rory may not even keep the baby, so her circumstances may not change at all. 

But if she does keep the baby, I think the OS really showed us how having a baby doesn't mean your life is over. Emily always accused Lorelai of ruining her life by having Rory, and Lorelai made it clear that she made a life in spite of, and partly because of, having a child.  It made things harder, but not impossible. And it'll be far easier for Rory than it was Lorelai.

I honestly don't think this will stop her. It doesn't interfere with writing a book nearly as much as it would being a field reporter. She's out of school. She may well get back together with the father. Luke and Lorelai were half wanting a baby; they'll help her raise it. I think it came at the best ""worst"" time possible. I think assuming that Rory's life is over because of this means ignoring everything that was taught in the OS.

Also, I kind of love that Lorelai spent SO much time trying to keep Rory from repeating her mistakes, that she tried SO hard to be the opposite of Emily in the hopes of having her daughter turn out differently than she did, and it still happened. It think it's a great way to show that no matter how you parent, you can't control your kid. You can't stop them from making mistakes. You just have to trust them to do the best they can to fix them or live with them, and I have no doubt Rory will. 

I know Rory was pretty terrible in the revival, but I think Rory's worst side was coming out because she was trying to make things work in a career she didn't want, she was trying to tell herself she wasn't in love with Logan, she was in total denial about her life. (Similar to when she got more and more selfish in the OS - she gets incredibly selfish and mean when she doesn't know her direction in life or is in denial about something.) I think now she's finally figuring out who she is and want she wants, and I think she'll start to become the Rory she was in the beginning, only better. Another full circle.

I also don't really see her completely repeating Lorelai's storyline. I think it's more of a general repeat; I don't think Amy is saying that Rory is JUST like Lorelai, that Logan is JUST like Christopher, that Jess is JUST like Luke. I think it's an inspiration, but not a carbon copy. Rory and Lorelai are definitely not identical, but similar enough that I can buy them having unique but parallel experiences.

Again, none of this is meant to be an ""anyone who disagrees with me is wrong about the revival"" post; I just wanted to share why I found it satisfying and in keeping with the OS and its original themes and plots.

Just imagine if after season 7 they would've been able to write a book with their original ideas and what they had planned already.

As a fan I don't mind the idea of Rory having a baby after 21 as it was sort of expected and it's not like she ever expressed anything against being a mom, so wouldn't it have been great to have a book between the OS and the revival?

A book were all this ideas came to life, you know Rory being scared, Richard and Emily being ""grandparents"" for the first time, Luke being there for Lorelai as she might have been a little disappointed, Jess being naive and trying to win Rory's heart (assuming she was single) or you know all the things that seem odd during the revival.

You are.

The revival, more than anything, was neutral. It didn't cast judgement on the characters. It said ""this is where they are, this is what they're doing"" and it never once told you how to feel about it.

Most scenes can be interpreted in a variety of ways.

A cruel playboy using Rory, or a man holding onto a forlorn love hoping for reciprocation?

A former prodigy failing her destiny or a talented woman finding a new one?

A drummer cheated out of her future, or a woman who found happiness in a normal life?

A woman whose life was ruined by getting pregnant while unmarried (and you called the Gilmore Girls judgmental) or a mother-to-be who finally has the motivation to turn her life around?

It's all in how you look at it. Life is a series of ups and downs. We start the revival with our heroines at a low point, and at the end we see the beginnings of a high point.

There's no reason to assume that Rory's pregnancy is a bad thing. Unplanned, sure. The circumstances are unfortunate. But do you really think that it's a life-ruiner? Why, because she can't have her career as an overseas correspondent? Not only is that not true, it seems that it isn't even what Rory wants anymore.

Does Rory's worth as a character hinge entirely on her career? Isn't that just as ridiculous as being solely concerned about which guy she ends up with?

We all have dreams and aspirations. Dreams change. Sometime we are unable to accomplish them and sometimes we do accomplish them just to find that we no longer want them. That's life.

It doesn't matter if she lives in Fez, Manhattan, or Stars Hollow. It doesn't matter if she works for CNN, the SH Gazette, or as a book writer.

I also left out about 50 billion things. Using a throwaway because I also shared this on my facebook.]

It turns out that Gilmore Girls was a lot darker, a lot weirder, and a lot more adult than we all thought it was. In A Year in the Life, the Netflix addition to the series, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino twists the narrative back to where she intended it to be all along, wildly and brilliantly subverting expectations in the process. We all thought that Gilmore Girls was clever fluff; rapid-fire pop-culture references and teen angst in a setting that was as idiosyncratic as it was warm and comforting. What we didnt understand was that over the course of six seasons, Sherman-Palladino was preparing for the ultimate upset: that this show isnt actually a coming-of-age story about a mother and daughter who are best friends. It is a surrealist, Lynchian, expectations-shattering masterpiece about the quirky and idyllic wonderland of Stars Hollow and the isolation of those caught in its allure. It was losing Sherman-Palladino in the seventh season that altered the trajectory of the show and confused the narrative. 

By the end of the sixth season, Gilmore Girls had taken several dark turns in character development. We hadnt yet let go of the idea that Rory was worthy of our esteem, despite the fact that she had participated in destroying a marriage and had been arrested for stealing a boat. She dropped out of Yale and crumbled before our very eyes, living a pool house life of privilege and DAR meetings. Lorelais lies to Luke about her involvement with Christopher set off an intense downward spiral into depression and misery, as did Lukes months-long concealment of the fact that he had a daughter. Seeing the characters we love stuck looping through patterns of self-destructive behaviour, punctuated by quotable phrases like Bring on the imperialistic condiments!, was painful and confusing. But it was the very fact that we hadnt yet realized that these characters werent heroes that made it confusing. We were still under the Stars Hollow spell, cast expertly by Sherman-Palladino who sprinkled in oddballs such as Kirk and Taylor like fairy dust.

It was no longer magic by the time the series concluded in 2007, despite the fact that an entirely different endgame for Rory had been planned years ahead of time by Sherman-Palladino. The writers hired to complete season seven in Sherman-Palladinos absence warped the series back onto itself in order to twist illusion into reality, calling into question what had happened with the writing in the previous three years. Rory concluded her story as an ambitious graduate, chasing her journalism dreams on the campaign trail with Barack Obama. It was Rorys expected end. While many fans were upset at her breakup with Logan, others viewed it as a sign of growth. The visible hits to Rorys judgement and self-worth over the course of her relationship with Logan had been part of Sherman-Palladinos dark narrative, so for her to evolve beyond it signaled not only a new strength in Rory but a new beginning as well. Conversely, knowing that the seventh season might be its last, the writers included an understated reconciliation for Luke and Lorelai who, despite their struggling relationship, remained fan favourites. Ultimately, the series ended with applause and adulation for Rory at her surprise bon voyage party, cementing the new narrative that Rory was, in fact, a hero, as was Lorelai (by extension). 

We now know, however, that the ending Sherman-Palladino was working towards involved a very different outcome for Rory. In the revival, Sherman-Palladino has undone Rorys season seven growth (which admittedly began at the end of season six with Jess visit). Rory is back to her relationship-destroying ways by carrying on a long-term affair with Logan who is now cheating with her instead of on her. Rory, too, is cheating on a long-term partner who has no role in the revival other than to be Rorys cuckold. The ambition she exuded at the end of season seven has evaporated and she, in her own words, coulda been a contender. Mitchum was right when he told her she didnt have what it takes to become a journalist. She arrogantly shows up to interviews unprepared and bombs them. She doesnt catch onto opportunities that present themselves except at the Stars Hollow Gazette, where shea former editor of the Yale Daily Newsbecomes editor because there is nobody to challenge her. It is there that Jess visits again to provide her with an inspirational boost, putting her on a mission that will keep her captive in her little corner of the world and ruminating on her life with Lorelai.

It is similarly miserable for Lorelai in the revival. Professional success has never been Lorelais sticking point, though her ambition appears to come from an external source. In the series, she is desperate to be financially independent from her controlling parents and even costs Rory a trust fund from Trix. In the revival, Lorelais ambition to expand the inn is driven by her anxiety over losing Michel. Ultimately, she makes peace with her late father and accepts the trust money set aside for Luke to franchise his diner in order to purchase the old folks home, hinting at resignation in her lifelong emotional standoff with Emily. But things are not as they seem: in the wee hours of Luke and Lorelais wedding day, Emily is still in Nantucket.

Similarly, Luke and Lorelais weddingin the town square, decorated like a pink wonderland by Kirk, complete with a small door that says open me and a giant keyis steeped in Stars Hollow magic and built on illusion. The scene reflects back to the peak of their happiness together: their dance at Liz and T.J.s renaissance wedding, in those moments of heady anticipation before they were a couple. Sherman-Palladino carefully crafted the early relationship between Luke and Lorelai using Stars Hollow magic. Their chemistry was undeniable in those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer, but their coming together at the Dragonfly was the kiss of death for Luke and Lorelai and the beginning of their downward spiral into dysfunction. Nine years after the series originally ended, Luke and Lorelai are still making the same rookie relationship mistakes. They are still marinating in their own distrust of each other, creating secrets where there should be none and building illusionsfor themselves and othersof a content partnership. Their co-dependence is evidenced in Lukes anxiety-induced monologue over Lorelais bolting signs as he declares he will be whoever she wants him to be, relinquishing his agency. The downward spiral for Lorelai is that despite having thirteen years to resolve these issues or move on from them, she and Luke havent, and her moment of clarity is to fix the relationship by marrying him. The wedding cements the idea that Lorelai is trapped in an illusion and standing completely still. 

Stylistically, the revival was more overt in its use of artifice and surrealism. In the series, Sherman-Palladino was careful to maintain the illusion that what we were watching was quirky, but grounded in reality. In A Year in the Life, she divested the viewers of that illusion by expertly blending the real with the surreal. Further to the allusion to wonderland at Luke and Lorelais wedding, The Life and Death Brigade, with whom we have previously felt the tease of illusion in season five of the series, make a reality-bending appearance. It begins with a bird calling Rory by name and a Macbeth-quoting unicycle rider lulling the viewer into the belief that this must be a dream sequence. However, the scene continues to play out as if it is the most natural thing in the world, eventually exposing itself as Sherman-Palladinos unique brand of Stars Hollow reality where its normal to wear a steampunk suit and a gorilla mask. Further, both the series and the revival are littered with nods towards Twin Peaks and other David Lynch works, in both casting choices and pop-culture references.

The events of A Year in the Life are the natural progression of Amy Sherman-Palladinos creative vision. We, as viewers, were distracted by the illusion that Stars Hollow was just a setting and not a player. We laughed at the pop-culture references and felt the warm comfort of an idyllic town and its quirky townspeople. The slow burn from the clever fluff of the first three seasons to the angst and desperation in seasons four through six confused and frustrated us because we didnt yet understand that the long game of Gilmore Girls, according to Sherman-Palladino, was a dark narrative about upturned expectations, isolation, illusion, and agency in a dissonant setting. With her departure at the end of season six, the seeds planted as early as season one never bloomed, and the events of Sherman-Palladinos later seasons lost their purpose. The revival restored that purpose. Gilmore Girls is no longer the kind of television we thought it was, but it is the kind of television that Rory and Lorelai would binge-watch and over a box of pop tarts, much like Donna Reed or Grey Gardens. The illusion that Gilmore Girls is comforting like a warm sweater or an old friend is shattered, but what remains is infinitely more complex and interesting.  

*Edit for clarity: I wasn't happy with the quality of the first three episodes. I felt that it was poor dialogue exacerbated by actors that had lost their connection and flow in the time since the series ended. The fourth episode was flawed, but brilliant in areas and overall much better.

I avoided the internet to watch it at my own pace. I came here immediately after I finished everything to read about cameos I might have missed and how the teams may have evolved. &lt;3 I scrolled all the way down down down to read EVERYTHING. I was very much looking forward to talking to my community because I love this subreddit.

Here is the thing. When I found out the revival was EVEN HAPPENING I felt incredibly blessed that Netflix existed, that the actors are still around and still awesome, and that the universe got everything together to give us just a *little* more of this thing we've been using on repeat. There was never ANY hope on my part that we would ever see any new GG in any form. People have moved on, but we fans never do.

But I had to stop going through all the discussions. I scrolled down for pages, all the way to the people saying they were staying up all night. But 90% of the posts were **so** damn negative. It's risky to say that here because I am probably opposing 90% of subreddit posters... so I didn't want to say the word *bitching* because I did not want to piss anyone off further, but it does feel like we were all SO excited and as soon as we get something we are now complaining so hard and picking apart this gift that was created for us that I feel like I need to say something so that the positive has a chance to come through.

I am here to just throw some positive feedback to those who made this even possible (disappointed fans includedthe number of people interested, even if angry, made this a reality for those who, like me, are extremely grateful for a glimpse of the 10 years later of these characters I've watched and followed for so many years). You got so many of the actors we like to show their faces and say hi! You gave us a good idea of what they have been up to over these years. You used the same sets! Hell, I would be happy with a table reading of a tenth of these people drinking coffee together in character for four hours.

If you are reading this: thank you Amy, Netflix, Original Cast, New Cast and Crew, and fellow Fans for allowing me to sit on my couch and get brand new emotional experience with my old friends, while giving me the believable illusion that Stars Hollow never stopped just because the show did. We all played a partI appreciate this and am so happy the pieces fell into place and that we got this awesomeness of a mini miracle. I hope the negativity (I really believe this comes from a love for the series and the expectations we all had in our heartsyou gave us new stuff to talk about so we are going to pick it apart I suppose) does not discourage anyone from considering doing something like this for us fans again sometime. (If we get more, I'd have a heart attack) It was awesome, thank you. :)

**TL;DR** Can you believe they made us a brand new batch of a ""dead"" show? Isn't that awesome? Who even does that? Thank you so much, GG fans are the luckiest. &lt;3

I just wanted to say how grateful I am for the show, and the revival. For a long time now, all of these wonderful characters have meant so much to me. Something about this show feels like home. When times have been difficult, it has been a great comfort.

But it has been more than that to me, if I am being honest. The struggles, the heartbreak, the themes of love and respect - through all of this I feel I have learned a lot. Or perhaps more accurately, I have learned about some of the things I have to work on. Gilmore Girls continues to inspire me to work towards being someone better than I am now.

About the revival, I personally loved it, even though I do agree there are some things left up in the air. It makes me sad to think of it ending with Rory in the middle of a difficult time. But it was very nice to finally see Luke and Lorelai happy. I love all the characters, but as a guy I must admit I love Lorelai especially. I also love Luke, and it makes me very happy that they are together. But while intellectually I know she is just a character in my favorite tv show, Lorelai will always have a little piece of my heart.

And I am very grateful we got to see all of our friends again. This came at a strange time for me. Things have been feeling a bit dark, as of late. But the revival has helped me to renew my efforts to be a better guy. Time marches on, and we all get older. But there is still time left for me to be a better friend, a better husband. Stars Hollow exists in a way in our hearts, I feel. When I am my best self, I'm working towards being a better citizen of Stars Hollow. My hope is that one day I might be someone they would have been proud of.

Thank you for reading my ramblings! Love to you all, my fellow citizens.

Rory's perception of him cheating was her opinion. They were on a break and he genuinely didn't believe they were together -- because they weren't at the time. He didn't cheat.

I think instead of having him cheating on Odette, he should have had an open relationship. He was very clear on not being a ""boyfriend"" guy when he and Rory first started going out. Let's have him continue that philosophy and be dating two women at the same time -- even if he was engaged/super serious with one and not so much with the other.

The revival completely changed his dating methods and had him suddenly okay with cheating on his fiancee. The old Logan was upfront about not being a relationship guy/etc. I get that he could have changed, but I feel like it could have been handled better. It was like tossing out his character development in favor of Jess -- who always would have been able to end up with Rory because of *his* character development.

Let's be real -- it's either Jess or Logan who would end up with Rory and whoever's side you're on, it's plausible to see either one of them as the final contender. BECAUSE OF THEIR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! They both changed for the better by the end of the original run. (Rory, on the other hand, needs to take a page from both of their books and learn to do the same...)


If Logan is supposed to be mirroring Christopher, then it would have been better to give a little more stability to Logan and Rory's relationship. Christopher was unreliable and in and out of Lorelai's life, but he was always down for marrying Lorelai. He would have married her and worked for Richard when Lorelai was pregnant if she had let him.

Anyway, I was sad to see Logan turn into a guy who could keep Rory on the side while hiding her from his fiancee instead of being upfront and not hiding it. The old Logan wouldn't be engaged as part of a ""dynastic plan."" He would have done what he wanted and he wouldn't be planning to marry -- or be in a serious relationship -- with someone he didn't care about. Obviously he seems to care about Odette at least a little, but the old Logan wouldn't be cheating on the woman he loves.

He seemed to be treating Rory like a doll to play with and cheer up instead of expanding her worldview/helping her to grow like he used to. I find it funny that both Logan and Jess offer different viewpoints and opportunities for Rory, which is supposed to help her learn new things/grow, but she doesn't really learn.

Feeling happy and getting hit by emotion in a blink of an eye when you least expected it is part of the brilliance of GG: sharp, quick, funny as hell dialogue with underlying serious heavy drama. The sudden, dramatic turns were done succesfully, I feel like, but was the humor as strong as we wished? Even unhappy dialogue can be funny, such as angry friend Michel and Paris for example.

Although its a blessing and a curse that we can passionately discuss the choices of storylines, the unique, funny dialogue that only ASP can write is the center of the show that I mainly looked forward to.",26,11,False,self,,,,,

But my biggest issue by far was the complete dismissal of the character development and major plot points of S7. I understand that S7 was not what ASP had planned, but that doesn't change the fact that it happened! The biggest transgression being Rory's career. When we last saw her she was heading out on the campaign trail with Barack Obama. How did this not lead to anything more? For years we were told what a fantastic and ambitious writer Rory is, how can it be that such an amazing opportunity would be completely squandered and then not explained? ASP ignoring such plot points in order to finally give us the ending she had planned all along was not redeeming or entertaining. It simply made the revival feel disjointed and awkward.

Because there were no Palladinos to write the dialogue for them. Why didnt Rory write a book before now? Why did her entire career flounder?

In the original series Jess demonstrated quite a bit of character development - going from being clueless, angst ridden, bookish rebel to a successful professional (who still seems a touch angsty). You also see a great bit of character development between him and Luke, which is continued in the revival. They seem to have reached a point of understanding and appreciation for one another which wasn't there when Jess originally came into the picture. 

What I don't understand about the revival is that, despite Jess's seemingly continued character development (he seems closer to Luke than ever), and the years that have passed - he is still pining over Rory. In the original run it seems like they dated for less than a year, and it's been over 10 years since then. As an adult, I can't think of anyone who is still pining over a person they dated as a teen, especially if said ex's outcomes turned out to be as lackluster as Rory's. 

I may have understood the attraction had Rory developed as a person and/or actually made something of herself - It would make sense for Jess to be attracted to someone who he has had a history with, at a similar stage in life, and with similar goals. However, Rory has no career, no goals, and is displaying the same vapid and selfish character traits that clearly bothered him in the original series (I would argue to an even greater extent). Further, the traits that appeared to draw Jess to Rory in the first place, her kindness, innocence, sweetness, and even her penchant for reading appear to be lacking (I could be wrong but Rory doesn't seem to read much in the revival, I recall only seeing her with a book at the pool). 

How is it that in the 10 years since the series ended, Jess (who has been living in a metropolitan area) hasn't found an attractive, hipster, mildly angsty, bookish type? Seriously, it strikes me as highly improbable that, by now, he wouldn't have found someone with whom to smoke cigarettes and have literary discussions. Even if there is an inexplicable dearth of people like that in Philadelphia, you would think that in the past 10 years he would have at least visited Brooklyn a couple times. 

I think that my main issue with the revival is the fact that many of the characters appear to have just been frozen for the past 10 years. I was hoping to witness the lives of these characters as they continued from where the show left off, but it seems like the majority of these characters were simply put on ice and thawed out for the revival. I can only think of a few people in real life who have experienced so little personal development in the past decade - and I am saddened by them. I guess my feelings about the revival mirror my feelings about those people, it's just sad.

Enjoy and feel free to add if I've missed any.

Obvious references:
-""I smell snow""

-Troubadour fights like in Season 1

-LDB gorilla masks

-Dean and Rory, cornstarch 

-Reflecting Light playing during the wedding scene, same song as season 5 Last week fights, this week tights when Luke &amp; Lorelai waltz 

-Getting married in the gazebo where they had their first kiss after the first proposal in the season 6 premiere 

**Winter**:

-Hospitals and funerals make Luke nervous. He drives Rory home/to the airport from both, Emily reacts the same way when Lorelai stays with her both times, pleasantly surprised. (Season 1)

-Digger and Umlauts (Season 4) Lorelai and Jasons childhood nicknames

-Ship sailed reference about virginity is also used by Rory when is confronted by the Reverend (Season 6- Twenty-One is the Loneliest Number)

-Doll, park, zoo, things that Richard and Lorelai did together, Lorelai talked about it with Luke (Season 1- Forgiveness and Stuff):

LORELAI: I feel like this is one of those moments when I should be remembering all the great times I had with my dad, you know. The time he took me shopping for a Barbie or to the circus or fishing and my mind is a complete blank.

LUKE: Well Im sure it happened.

LORELAI: No it didnt. We never did any of that. He went to work, he came home, he read the paper, he went to bed, I snuck out the window. Simple. He was a very by the numbers guy. I was never very good with numbers.

-Fight in ""Rory's birthday Parties"" in Season 1 is similar to the fight after the funeral. Emily yells at the help and then at Lorelai.

-""Get out!"" Lorelai tells Emily to get out of her house during an argument in ""Rory's Dance"" (Season 1) and Emily says it to Lorelai at the end of funeral fight. 

-Books to decipher April's letter- Similar to how Luke used books to help with her homework in season 6

-Luke says he has Jess to toss a ball with, Lorelai's response about tossing a ball 'with not at' Jess (Season 3, Swan song) Jess lied to Rory about how he got a black eye by tossing a ball around with his friends.

-Luke settled for not getting a picture window and Lorelai is concerned about the growing list of things he gave up to be with her. (Season 6 finale) Lorelai says she didn't get the purple wallpaper because he didn't want it and that she gave it up for him: [Stretch, I know, but I remembered that scene as soon as she said it]

LORELAI: We fixed up the house, right? We have a bigger closet, and I didn't get the purple wallpaper because you didn't want the purple wallpaper. And if it's between you and the purple wallpaper, I pick you!

-Paris asking Luke if he remembers her (Season 6 premiere) She didn't remember him several times throughout Season 6

-Wifi vs fax line (Season 4) Lorelai uses the fax line for internet for emails, Luke isn't happy about it then either

-Emily giving away stuff from Gilmore mansion similar to the boyfriend boxes, Lorelai tells her not to because she'd regret it just like she told Rory in season 1 :

LORELAI: Oh. The Dean box. Okay, I know I was supposed to throw it away, but I couldn't. I mean, you're young and your head's all weird, and you don't have any perspective because of that whole young weird headed thing, so just please listen to me before you get mad. You're gonna want that stuff one day, when you're old and married, and looking back and thinking, I certainly had an interesting life. And then you can pull out all your old boyfriend boxes. Which is good, because I threw away stuff I'd kill to have today. Look, I put it in with the Max box so they could chat and keep each other company and commiserate about how they had Gilmore girl and lost a Gilmore girl and . . .sorry.

-Lorelai referring to Berta's family as the Winchester mystery family. (Season 1 finale) Lorelai calls her house the Winchester mystery house when Luke won't stop fixing it to avoid Rachel.

**Spring**:

-Cheshire Cat is also the name of the inn where they stayed on the Harvard trip in the Season 2 premiere

-Lennox Hatlestad is an B list actor at the Dragonfly. Jim and Milly Hatlestad stay at the Independence Inn in season 3 in a 'Tale of Poes and Fire'

-Big red couch at the movie theater is seen in the back during Eraserhead scene.  (Season 5, We've got a Pippi Virgin) 'Big Red' is where Luke &amp; Lorelai and Rory &amp; Dean sat. The love couch is seen where Kirk and 
Lulu makeout when they're watching Pippi

-Paris not being a Puff is because Charleston stopped them from finishing the initiation in Season 1

-""You got any other Caesars?"" comment by the real estate women may be a reference to other actors playing Caesar in the OS.

-Viggo Mortenson mentioned in Season 6 when Luke sponsors the baseball team, Lorelai said they'd make a movie about him and Viggo or Donald Sutherland (Kiefer mentioned in Fall) would play him:

LORELAI: Cool. Wow. They could make a movie about this someday. You know...The reluctant, handsome diner owner sponsoring a team that goes all the way to the national finals, and you know who would play you?

LUKE: Who?

LORELAI: Tobey Maguire!

LUKE: He's way younger than me.

LORELAI: But his career is hot. Go with Tobey.

LUKE: What about that Vito Morgenstern?

LORELAI: Sure. Or Viggo Mortensen.

LUKE: Oh.

LORELAI: Or Donald Sutherland.

-When Lorelai asks Luke if he went to the bank, she says they like collars (Pilot episode, final scene when Luke explains why he's dressed up):
LUKE: I had a meeting earlier at the bank. They like collars. You look nice, too. 

**Summer**:

-When Lorelai calls Rory a 'kid' during the argument at the cemetery she responds with ""I am not a kid"". In the Season 4 finale, during fight with Lorelai about sleeping with Dean she says the same thing.

-When Rory walks away from Lorelai at the cemetery she says, ""So much for the happy news"". In the season 4 finale during the argument with Lorelai about sleeping with Dean she says ""I hate you for ruining this for me.""

**Fall**:

-Inn where the Life &amp; Death Brigade stay is the Dragonfly Inn but redecorated (I think?)

-The proposal plays out similarly to the OS Luke &amp; Lorelai proposal:
Lorelai proposes marriage, Luke is caught off guard, Lorelai is surprised by his reaction when he walks away to get the ring
In the OS, Lorelai proposes marriage, Luke is caught off guard, and when they're walking out to get something to toast with he says Hey! Wait!' and she's surprised by his reaction, scared he changed his mind for a second

-The entire conversation about money for the inn between Lorelai and Emily mirrors the one from the pilot episode with Lorelai and Richard:

LORELAI: Well, actually, I came here for a reason. Dad, would you mind sitting down for a minute?

RICHARD: You need money.

LORELAI: I have a situation.

RICHARD: You need money.

LORELAI: Dad, will you just please let me get this out, okay? Um, Rory has been accepted to Chilton.

EMILY: Chilton? Oh, that's a wonderful school. It's only five minutes from here.

LORELAI: That's right, it is. She can start as early as Monday. Um, the problem is that they want me to put down an enrollment fee plus the first semester's tuition, and I have to do that immediately or she loses her spot.

RICHARD: So, you need money.

LORELAI: Yeah. But it's not for me, it's for Rory. And I fully intend to pay you back every cent. I don't ask for favors, you know that.

EMILY: Oh, yes, we know.

RICHARD: I'll get the checkbook.

LORELAI: Thank you. You have no idea. Thank you.

EMILY: On one condition.

LORELAI: [mumbles to herself] So close.

-Conversation with Rory and Dean in the market, the way she describes him as safe is the way she talked about him with Lane in the season 4 finale Raincoats and Recipes:

RORY: I guess. You know, when I was with Dean, I always knew that no matter what happened, he would be there.

LANE: Dean was very dependable.

RORY: It was more than that. He's -- well, he was so... um, I was safe, and he was so nice to me.

LANE: He really loved you.

RORY: I think I really blew it there, you know? I didn't appreciate it.

-When Jess tells Luke he looks good, and he responds with Yea?, similar to how he responded to Lorelai when she said he looked good in season 1 Forgiveness &amp; Stuff (not as flirtatious, clearly!)

-The fact that they eloped was what they had discussed in season 6 A Vineyard Valentine and when Luke tried to convince her in the season 7 premiere:

LUKE: What about eloping?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Eloping, we can do that, right? Instead of planning this whole big thing?
LORELAI: I don't know. Maybe. I guess we could. But Rory has to come. Is it still eloping if Rory comes?
LUKE: Sure, why not? Let's start planning it.
LORELAI: You don't plan an elopement. You just do it.
LUKE: Oh, right. That makes sense. We could even come back do it here when the weather's better. We could rent a place for a couple weeks in the summer.
LORELAI: That sounds nice.

Also, assume that broadly, the endings remain the same - 1 ex is completely over her, happy and has what he wanted. Another ex has a good life, is doing well, is on friendly terms and is still pining for her. The third ex is still sleeping with her casually while engaged to someone else - they have one final fun-filled romp, say goodbye and Rory ends up pregnant. Which ending would you prefer for your favorite ex? And how would to switch around the other 2?

Option 1: Things happened as they happened. They more or less fit the character and is the best possible way to end - if not the right one. 

Option 2: Dean is happily married with kids. Logan is running his father's business and is on 'amicable exes' terms with Rory - but he still loves her. He's also the one to give her the idea of writing a book about her life. Jess is stable professionally, but he is also engaged. Since cheating would be OOC for him - assume that his fiance is a secure, artistic type who knows of his history and tells him to get it out of his system before they tie the knot. 

Option 3: Dean is amicable exes with Rory, but still in love with her and also still single. But he has a stable professional life. He may not be the literary type, but he gets Rory's relationship with her mother so he suggests writing the book. Jess is completely over Rory and in a relationship (with or without kids) - he is simply polite when they meet with no hint of pining. Logan stays the adulterating engaged guy. 

Option 4: Dean is once again cheating on his fiance and sleeping with Rory (she does like a safety net when insecure). But he is smarter about it - he knows Rory will never end up with him, so he won't break it off with his fiance and is determined to marry her. So, after one last time, they say goodbye forever and Rory ends up pregnant. Jess is the friend who gives her advice on the book and is still pining for her. Logan is completely over her, married (with or without kids) and is simply polite to her when they bump into each-other. 

Am I forgetting any options? 

So, if you wanted to change, which option would you choose? And no, they can't all have the same ending or any other ending you'd like better - these are the only ending that are going to happen and your only choice is picking one for the characters.

2) I love that any future revival related storylines will revolve around Rory and her path moving forward. I can see her working herself into a better person - with the help of Jess. A little like Lorelai did with Luke. I imagine Rory will take her own path and work things out in the same way her mum did.

3) I love this show. I love the revival. It was a suckerpunch with a random musical but STILL. I'm glad ASP was able to go with her creative instincts and deliver a believable and real storyline. She has placed Rory in a good position where she can now face reality and redeem her behaviours.

Of course, we know most of Stars Hollow thinks the sun rises and sets on Rory, but what about the people who aren't quite as biased?

How do you think these people would tell Rory's Revival Story?

Babette and Miss Patty: They are biased. Notorious gossips who have a soft for Rory, but what if they knew the WHOLE story including her erratic Yale behavior and her affair with Logan? I think they'd stay loyal, but I'm curious if Rory's protected status from the gossip mill would diminish.

Logan: He probably is pretty okay with Rory other than the fact that she refused to move in to his house as his permanent side chick, but do you think his POV would have changed how Rory was presented? What if we'd actually met Odette on screen?

Jess: Jess was there but he didn't get to say hardly anything that wasn't a Rah-rah for Rory. I would have liked to have seen him interact more with Luke and Lorelai's story. But what would he have said if he'd known about the affair with Logan and the baby? We know how he felt about Rory's Yale antics. Would we have still had that last look through the window? Would we have gotten another epic ""This isn't you"" speech?

Dean: I'm biased. I'm Team Dean and I'm thrilled with how his story ends. But I am curious. He's the boyfriend most likely to be vilified. Rory says that in her book she'll talk about how he was safe and the perfect first boyfriend, but would Dean say the same about her? After struggling through five years of what transitioned from a sweet first relationship to an on-and-off, argumentative relationship marred by infidelity, I can't imagine Dean would be as positive. Looking at the calm, happily married Dean who stammered at the idea of being included in Rory's book, I imagine that his behavior while in pursuit of Rory is actually one of the more embarrassing parts of his past from his POV.

Luke: Luke pretty much told Jess he wasn't good enough for Rory. He physically fought Dean for breaking up with her. I'm pretty sure he doesn't know about the current Logan affair or all the Yale stuff. He's always been there for Rory. Would his opinion change if he knew everything?

Marty: He tried. And failed. 

Paul: Poor Paul. He probably has an opinion.

And just for fun:

Michele: I would love to hear this whole story from Michele's POV if he knew everything.

I know ASP doesn't want Rory defined by her male relationships, but the females in her life are loyal to a fault. There is only murmurings of dissension amongst the men.

However, They've developed thanks to an [article](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/why-gilmore-girls-obsession-with-oz-is-the-key-to.html), a [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5fzo8t/revival_spoilers_where_you_lead_i_will_follow_how/) by u/throwawayggtheory, and a comment by u/skankenstein that seems to have been deleted unfortunately, but I'll try to give a summary:

Basically they said that Lorelai was always in on the joke in Gilmore.  If you gave her a banana and called it a phone, she would except that, but in the Musical Lorelai isn't accepting it.  She's becoming more like her mother and not entering into the ridiculous fantasy world that all the townies are propping up so desperately.  (I hope I did the comment justice)  This taps right back into the full circle and shows us how she no longer runs to a man or comfort.  Instead she runs to something she's always ignored, nature, and takes the time and space to make a thought out decision.  She casts a more positive light on her father, mends some of the damage between her and her mother, and finally makes that very adult step of marriage.

I missed that implication when watching the musical, though I did gather some of the general context of what was being [contrasted](https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5g48mr/revival_spoilers_article_on_the_meaning_of_the/dapidr8/).   But therein lies the forward momentum of all three storylines.  

It's time for Lorelai to move forward--as with all the girls.  Rory takes a trip through Oz and says goodbye and heads home with a better understanding of reality and who she is and how to walk on her own two feet, or four.  Lorelai's experience in the Wonderland of Stars Hollow has caused her to look in the mirror and really examine herself and open the door to a committed marriage.  Then you have Emily who is pushed out into a new journey by death, and she's telling the story of a great whale dying in Nantucket.  There's two things about this: 1. Rory reads Moby Dick in the Pilot.  2. Part of the Novel occurs in Nantucket.  

Moby Dick Represents Good and Evil, Opposition and Mystery.  It starts with one of the most famous lines of any novel: Call me Ishmael.  There's ambiguity there, and for the first time in a long time there's ambiguity in who each of these girls are.  They are dealing with the good and evil, the opposition and the mystery and it's a perilous journey, but they are all telling their own story.

Even Moby Dick's story is told cyclically due to trauma.  Ishmael doesn't want to get to the dark part of the journey due to the trauma it unleashed in his life, so he tells a little bit of the story, and then he goes off on tangents over and over again.  In a way, Gilmore Girls does this too.  We are told the story of their lives, but we constantly spend time on the fluff of their interactions and try to get over the drama as concisely as possible, and Family itself is treated as a Monster that no one wants to face, that holds traumatic memories.  

In a world inundated with references to great stories they have all become parallel to a great story that came before.  Once again: full circle.  This is why we read.  To learn.  Because history repeats itself.",3,22,False,self,,,,,

The only issue is I found it very depressing and I didn't want to root for Rory. When the audience isn't given any reasons (and I generally really like Rory, I WANTED to see her succeed) to root for one of the MCs I don't think the writer are doing storylines as well as they should be. However I've come up with a few ways that I think they could have 'redeemed' the Rory storyline.
1) Had only one area of her life as a mess. As in, her career was tanking but she was fine being single/in a stable relationship, or she had a messed up love life but her career was doing well.
2) If all areas of her life had to be a mess, show her progression to be a better person. Maybe the idea for the book and breaking up with Logan was meant to be that, but then she goes back to sleeping with Logan and never admits remorse. If she'd had made steps towards changing (admitting she messed up, actively trying to become a less selfish person, having more self awareness) we could believe that she becomes that determined person with a moral compass that she used to be.
3) Show us that she's good with kids. Paris' children was the perfect opportunity for that. They could have had her playing with them, really bonding etc to show us that she's actually really good with kids. So that when we find out she's pregnant we have hope because we know she'll be a good mother.",8,3,False,self,,,,,

Or, at the very least, the nostalgic memory of said feelings. However, there is something about that scene that struck me as blatant foreshadowing. Jess is not just looking at Rory, he's watching her nurse a sick Kirk, much like a mother would. Is it pure coincidence that we are shown such a scene only moments before Rory reveals that she's pregnant? 

Did Rory tell Jess before she told Lorelai? This seems out of character given the relationship that Rory and Lorelai have, but not impossible. Maybe Jess knows and the ""look"" is not one of longing, but of concern for Rory's situation and future? Is ASP foreshadowing Jess as a father figure in Rory's child's life, much like Luke was to Rory?

Is it also possible that we are in for a major plot twist in (what I hope will be) another season? ASP's has shared that Logan is to Rory as Christopher is to Lorelai, so it would make sense that the baby is Logan's, leaving Jess to fill the role of Luke in this ""full circle"" scenario. But some of the revival storyline felt like a puzzle piece being forced into a space that isn't quite the right shape.  Like how much of our beloved characters' development and growth in S7 seems to have been completely thrown out the window in the revival. So if they were to tell us in AYITL season 2 that Rory and Jess slept together at some point and the baby belongs to him, I wouldn't be overly surprised. As much as I love Jess, his background of communication issues and bolting when the going gets tough could also be interpreted as Christopher-esque.

**Jess:** I'm not playing golden retriever hoping one day she'll turn around and fall in my arms. If she doesn't want to be with me, then fine!


Such a great foreshadowing of what's going on in the Revival. I felt like Logan is still clinging to Rory, hoping she'll one day declare her love for him (which is what Matt Czuchry has said in interviews). He keeps trying to give Rory things and help her in any way he can, but instead of going anywhere it just leaves them in a tangled mess. Logan's trying to move on with Odette and his business, but Rory is still that one vulnerability that could cause problems in his New Empire.

A lot of people are saying that the Revival treated Jess badly, but despite his continued crush on Rory, he *has* moved on. He's not sitting around waiting for her or trying to make her fall in love with him; he has his job, doesn't keep regular contact with her, and doesn't even show his affections publicly. He'll give her advice but isn't being roped into her mess without the promise of some kind of interest given back to him.

Guys, I'm writing this post because one week after the revival, I'm finally enlightened about what I saw, and since I'm being so active in this sub for months before it starts, I felt like a shock in my expectations and I was ""smad"" for a long time until now.
I made a little joke about how I could handle everything from ASP before AYITL debut because I survived HIMYM's finale and nothing could be worst than that, but I have to admit it was pretty much the same feeling, and I wasn't ready for this.


**First** and most important of all, I think the revival disppointed me for my own fault. Yes, I was so desperate to see my happy ending that I got trapped in my own beliefs and expectations, like: "" ASP would never bring this masterpiece back and just ruin everything for me. Hell no! This couldn't possible never happen"". So I was very blind about all the hints and all of the things I didn't want to see.


**Second** We are not used to deal with our frustrations. This sub was an amazing oportunity to open our minds about a lot of aspects of the show, regardless people here have different visions, we all share the same feeling of ""unfulfilled promise"". I don't think anyone is really that annoyed by Lorelai's fate, despite the story could be better tied up, I think the angry feeling is about Rory.

I know The Palladinos never promised us anything, but we grew up thinking she would be everything we waited for: The great reporter, independent, amazing woman. Summing up: A better Lorelai. Rory had to overcome Lorelai, right? She was her daughter, so in my mind, she already borned from Lorelai's greatness startpoint and nothing in this world could make Rory become a failure, she will only make it better.
I felt betrayed, very betrayed to realize she wasn't nothing as I though. By the way: ASP's mind is nothing like we all thought.

So the same way Rory completely surprised our expectations, her love life was the same mess. I admit I didn't expect anything from Dean and I was happy with his life, but I din't know how to feel about Jess and Logan and I see people doing the same.
I'ts hard to accept, but Jess and Logan were exactly in the same place we saw them in season 6, but they aren't the person we thought they would be now. Despite Jess seems to be satisfied with his career, he is the same from ""The real Paul Anka"", a tool to help Rory, still in love with her and unrequited. Logan wasn't the same guy from season 7, bold and free spirit. Is too hard to accept ASP doesn't share our visions about the boys, they are just front steps to Rory with no personal evolution or individuality. I think a lot of people got attached to this boys, seing them as real important characters but they are probably not.

So what a hell? I guess we had a lot of this coming before the revival and we didn't listen to this. Of course we may choose to believe if we have more episodes, everything could happen, like Jess becoming a Luke, or Logan leaving his Odette for Rory, but to be honest? I don't think this is going to happen, because this is not what ASP want for them, they are done, so I chose stop to dream about my happy GG ending, stop to think that one of theses guys are the one, they probably aren't, so why bother to suffer about it? Maybe the shock was necessary, maybe I finally got it now and I'm accepting this isn't the way I wanted to be, but it is. If we have the oportunity to see GG again, and despite I have my favorite of them, I won't be helding any team's flag, because what's the point? Discuss this over and over with no result? Useless waste of energy.
So I'll ask you, why we felt the necessity of getting what we wanted? Does the revival only worth it if our expectations is fullfilled?",12,9,False,self,,,,,

Instead, please enjoy what is essentially very lazy/hazy/crazy fan fiction thought up while I was on a bus from Toronto to Buffalo. 

- When we see first Lorelai again, we see no sight of Rory. In her absence, Lane and Lorelai have become pals. Rory is a touchy subject, she's too busy for either of them. To us, it's supposed to feel weird and not right. Lane owns a successful customized built-in storage solutions business - all that hiding + all those antiques, it's a natural culmination. She's doing that to fund the creation of her own production studio in Stars Hollow. Taylor is not about that life; he ""doesn't want hooligans like Jack Johnson running around town."" Kirk is excited to explore the world of musical artistry after conquering filmmaking (he won the First Annual Stars Hollow Film Festival because the town didn't want to deal with him losing). Lane and Zach have divorced, but as Lorelai says, ""keep it Goopy"" for the kids. It's revealed that Mrs Kim divorced her husband too, and is the same as ever. She makes Steve and Kwan fake egg salad sandwiches. #lanedeservesbetterstorylines

- ""Where is Rory, lukeandkeiferarepals? You are murdering the thing I love most! Heathen!"" Rory, the industrious, focused Rory of old, is just that. Working as a reporter is not fun or easy. She's forced to take awful gigs and finds herself worn out. She misses her mother, her family, her people. She bumps into Logan. She hasn't seen him in 10 years, it's awkward. They have dinner, and by the end, it's like they're back at Yale, but he has to leave on a trip the next morning. She then bumps into Jess. They have dinner. By the end, it's like it's season 3 again. And Rory is confused. She goes back to Stars Hollow, needing Lorelai and Lane. She meets Dean. He's still single. They have dinner (kidding! I figured Dean could only cameo because Padalecki is making that Supernatural money, so what he did was passable, but please let's make Rory less pathetic). Dean is married with kids. 

Rory's arc in the new season should be finding balance. She should move back to Stars Hollow, have a one night stand, fall in love with those two guys again - maybe more. The Rory we know would have forgotten to have a personal life in the last ten years. OG Gilmore was Lorelai living a life and being herself while raising a daughter. AYITL should have Rory living a life and finding out who she is while having a career. 

- I beg of you, no Wild send-ups. Lorelai has to face her demons where they got her: in Hartford. While Emily goes to Nantucket, Lorelai agrees to take over for her mother - rather, she's guilted into it because of her remarks after the funeral. Her remarks at the funeral would be more along the lines of not getting along with her father and how perhaps that led her to seek male attention and have a child as a teenager, not how he left her in a steam trunk. She faces the DAR, now partially comprised of people she went to high school with, and makes peace with her father's death. She realizes she wants to marry Luke after realizing how fast life has gone by. (Honestly, Luke and Lorelai would've married in the years they were together. This is just an excuse to see their wedding). 

- Emily's storyline in the revival is very similar, save that she starts learning Spanish to communicate with Berta. We get to see Emily Gilmore at a loss for words. 

Other ideas:

- Luke continues to be Luke, water continues to be wet. Essentially the same as the actual storyline. #lukeandkeiferarepals

- Michel is the same as in the revival as well.The only thing I'd add would be a scene where he tries to cook. A thing of beauty it would be.

- Sookie has not gone to Blue Hill Farm. She's made her own version of it outside Stars Hollow with Jackson. She's just busy, not an irresponsible business partner/awful human. They hire a daily chef to carry out Sookie's orders. For the love of all that is holy, make it Alex Borstein. It's a funny meta commentary, and she can play the exact opposite of Sookie. THE BEST. (yes, she can also be Mme. Celine)

- April was boring, but Idk how to fix that. 

- Logan and Odette make no sense. He wouldn't have proposed to Rory, otherwise! 

- If anyone should become a Hollywood screenwriter, it should be Jess. Hot off a script adaptation from his best seller, the rebel becomes a sellout. 

- Team Stars Hollow: The Musical.  It should've been shorter, just clips, but I'll take more over less. Its a love, love, love revolution in a revolutionary time!

- My beloved Paris is a DC fixer. It's a cool reference to Scandal (Shonda uses a lot of Gilmore people) and also Paris would kill as a fixer. She and Doyle are still together, I will accept nothing less. Paris is pregnant with their first when we see her, and Rory gets to be there at her birth. We'll find out with those four last words that Rory is also pregnant at the time. 

Also no weird montages with Life and Death Brigade. Those dudes are cool, but all the running and dancing was weird af.

But here are some of the aesthetic nitpicky things that bothered me. 

Did anyone else find some of the camera work dizzying or distracting?  I enjoyed some of the more movie-like cinematography, like the beautiful panning shot of Stars Hollows winter lights, but there were parts where the camera was moving too much/heavy-handed.  And the framing for some of the character reveals like Chris, Logan, or Kirk at FND seemed like trying too hard to be clever/dramatic. 

I wish there were more zoomed out 'one-ers' or masters that the Palladinos in the OS was known for. Maybe someone with film production experience can weigh in.  I wonder if the compressed filming schedule led to more close ups? The close ups felt too close up sometimes, and there seemed to be more reaction shots.

I liked the added color to the sets and overall color differences between the seasons, but the lighting was a bit unnatural. I never used to notice lighting until I saw the examples in [this post about lighting in GG](https://m.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/53k1z5/the_horrible_cinematography_of_season_6_and_7) which I can now never unsee and never stop noticing. Clearly they didn't go back to their early season DP for the revival. 

Wardrobe/hair: I miss jeans-wearing Lorelai. I wasn't a fan of her hair highlights, and some of the hair styles like the up-do felt a little un-Lorelai. Lauren Graham almost looks more 'Lorelai' in some of her recent press appearances. Also Luke's pants were oddly baggy. ",15,18,False,self,,,,,

I was trying to figure out when Rory got pregnant and when Logan came to Stars Hollow.

When Lorelai comes back from hiking, she says ""I already picked a date. It's this month. It's on a Sunday""

When Lorelai is exercising with Ms. Celine, Luke says the wedding is in 3 days (Why are they finalizing/adding guests 3 days before the wedding?!)

That means EVERYTHING in between her coming back from hiking and the wedding dress fitting happens in.. two days. Emily going from Nantucket and the museum to the DAR and back to Nantucket and getting a job, Rory writing her book and coming back home and reuniting with Lorelai, Interviewing Michel's replacements and finding the annex.

So Rory finds out she's pregnant on Nov 2. Tells Lorelai on Nov 4.

There was nothing about dates prior to that. I looked for calendars in the background and shots of phones. Seems like ASP made a big mistake in the script when Lorelai said ""It's this month"" if she wanted to choose a date at the beginning of the month. She would have said ""It's this week"" or.. ""It's in 4 days"" and for ALL of that to take place in 4 days is absurd.

Anyway, if we back track Rory probably got pregnant late Sept-early Oct. It's weird that no one mentioned her birthday. They could have easily made the LDB event a birthday party.

Edit: Also, Rory mentions the fight with her mom to Logan, but not the book. Then in Fall he knows. Yet another inconsistency on top of.. how long Richard/Emily were married, multiple mentions of Stars Hollow already having sewers, the family mausoleum..

The scene before her talk with Jess is Rory driving to Emily's in the same Prius she had from the end of season 3. She could be driving without a license but she certainly has a car. Then the very next Rory scene we see, Rory is again driving her Prius to the cemetery, so it seems improbable that something happened to her car in between these two almost back to back scenes. 

Then she tells her mom she's looking at two bedroom apartments in Queens, when she just told Jess she can't afford underwear, and isn't going to be making money any time soon with the book or otherwise. 

ASP even said they didn't want to pay too much attention to Rory's finances, but why would they bother including this bit with Jess, that honestly could be incredibly relatable even though it completely contradicts the rest of what we are shown with Rory?

I just don't buy it. 

Logan is nothing like Chris, he's not unreliable like Rory's dad. Despite being way less loaded than the Huntzbergers (before the magical grandfather that came in the last season fiasco) it took Chris 2 daughters and more than 40 years before doing something meaningful with his career, but Logan was in the business world straight out of college and made bold moves to try to keep Rory in his future. They both became cheating assholes after that and that is what it is. 

Jess is not Luke. She is not even *slightly* interested in him just like she wasn't the last time they were together and he was more like he is now, more mature and less of a jerk (oh, and less greasy. Geez, shower much?). Let's just stop trying to make fetch happen.

She had a more meaningful moment running into Dean than Jess. Not saying there was any weird feelings there, but that is what encountering an old lover looks like, she clearly sees Jess just as a good pal. It's sad they made him still have a thing for her. They dated for a few months when she was 17, they're 'thirtysomething' now, to still rely on that teenage crush is sad. To wish to see them together is to root for Ted and Robin. She doesn't feel for Jess what she feels for Logan, them together would be just her settling for something less than what she once had. Unlike what happens with Lorelai and Luke.

Honestly, I really enjoyed the revival (except for the musical, hated and cringed so hard during the musical)! It was kinda like life, messy. Don't care who Rory picks, Lorelai and Emily moments were so good and heartbreaking and that was enough for me.

(Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5gpnfl/rorys_failure_only_problem_i_have_is_how_it_was/,payday1999,1480983861,"I don't have a problem with Rory failing, just with how it was done. 

From we've seen in the past, Rory is a great writer and in the revival, from what I saw Rory failed because she lost her passion, not because of her work. Sandee, loved her writing when talking to her on the phone. When she does her two interviews she seems both uninterested and can barely muster up or fake interest. At Sandee, Rory looked like she didn't want to be there and couldn't even fake enthusiasm with her potential new boss. On the phone call it did seem like they wanted to give Rory the job and not an interview, but it wouldn't surprise me if Sandee switched it to an interview with how Rory acted while showing her around. The biggest screw up is that Rory couldn't even muster up a pitch and seemed shocked that she was asked one. Which is surprising because that is what journalist do. We saw Rory do it back in her school days. 

I wish we would of been given something to show why Rory lost her passion. But whatever. 

I don't mind that ASP was trying to show that after 9+ years, that Rory was unhappy with her job or where her life was going. That is quite normal for a 30+ year old, because most people choose their life paths when they are teenagers. 

I hate that we are left up in the air about Rory and her career. All we see is that everything she worked for was torn to shreds. She even ruined everything with Sandee, by calling her after the interview. There was no reason to destroy that contact she had, it could of just been a bad interview. Everybody has them. 

During the revival we were shown a couple of jobs that Rory had the potential to do, but ASP never followed that route. When she was at Chilton, she looked so natural talking to the kids and they were responding well to her. I don't think the Headmaster offered her a job at the end out of pity, that's not like him. But he could see how well the kids were actively listening to her. Plus, he knows how smart she is. That was a missed opportunity for ASP to have Rory go back to school or to go teach somewhere else that doesn't require a Masters. But Chilton would make sense because I'm sure they pay great. There is a good size group of people going for their Masters at 30+ and who have children. It's doable if ASP wanted to do it. 

When she took over the gazette. I thought okay, maybe by doing this, she'll find her passion for journalism again. But no, we hardly saw Rory do anything. Instead we got a really long piece of Rory and Lorelai delivering newspaper. I was hoping that maybe Rory would make some changes or do anything really with the Gazette. I remember when she saved Yale Daily News that time when Paris was editor and how passionate she was doing it. We don't see that Rory anymore. They could of also maybe shown that while saving the Gazette that Rory comes to realize that she hates traveling and wants to move to something permanent, to be in one place. Maybe that's why she lost her passion for all things journalism. 

I don't mind the book idea. I do think that it would be a great book. I just think that they are a dime a dozen, with everybody writing their life stories these days. All I can think about is what is she going to do after she's done with it and gets it published? Her best bet to make a lot of money is if it turns into a movie or something. 

I don't know. I just feel like ASP wanted to destroy Rory's career or what she had left, but I don't see how writing a book is going to make Rory's situation better. She has no home, money, job, or anything really. What she going to do once the baby comes? She did write the first three chapters in a matter of weeks, so it's possible she can get the book done in a month or two. But with getting it published and then trying to get people to read it, she probably won't make any profit for at least a year. Her best bet is to have a bestseller, which is not easy. Even then, after a while she would need to write more books or move onto something else. I guess the book idea is suppose to give Rory back her passion. It sucks we won't be able to see what happens to Rory's career or her situation. ",30,50,False,self,,,,,

It has been a major selling point for Netflix shows. And yes, inteference from producers and higher-ups can often lead to tv shows that are bland, derivative and lacking in creativity in order to appeal to the largest audience they can.

When studio interference is mentioned in the media it is almost universally referred to as being a bad thing. However, I think that some of the recent offerings from Netflix show that a greater level of editorial control would actually be a good thing. 

Perhaps Netflix has realised that they've taken this idea of non involvement too far in one direction. And certainly there are shows that turn out great with no involvement from the higher ups, but there is a reason why studios have producers. There is a reason why studios do audience testing. There is a reason why studios have control over the final script.

I think netflix's desire to be the cool, hands off, creative studio has led them to go too far in one direction and it's biting them in the butt.

My letter to Amy Sherman-Palladino. (**Do not read unless you're done with the Gilmore Girls revival series!  Lots and LOTS of spoilers.)

Dear Amy Sherman-Palladino,
	Its entirely possible that Im seeing symbolism in the Gilmore Girls revival episodes that you never intended because I feel the need to make good on all the time and emotion I invested in the 4-part mini series.  I recently saw a documentary on how a boy with autism was able to find meaning in his real life experiences by applying the wisdom and lessons learned in his many Disney movies.  I could relate!  Im not on the spectrum (although I wonder sometimes if we all are, a bit), but I took so much away from the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, and feel as though watching it was better than years of therapy. 

Larger than Life:  Emily's identity is so closely tied to Richard, and you seem to explain so much through the portrait of Richard.  Emily makes him larger than (her) life after he dies.  Lorelai finally gets Emily to admit that this is a mistake, and we see Emily settle on a scaled-down version of Richard that perfectly fits into her new life.
	I think Lorelai's primary fear is that she's larger than life for Rory and Luke.  She doesn't want to loom over them and smother them with her shadow.   I think Lorelai blames Emily for making her too strong and too big.  Lorelai had to rise up to be Emily's worthy opponent and now she's worried that she's now too big to fit into Rory and Luke's homes.   We see her play around with the Wonderland mushroom, and she grows and shrinks until she finally feels comfortable in her own skin. When Lorelai is up on that mountain and finds joy and clarity in something so much larger than her, she forgives herself for being such a big, bold person. And she finally forgives Emily for making her run and run after that white rabbit all this time, and owns up to the part she played in that chase. 
	Ultimately, Emily doesn't need Richard to be larger than life and she lets go of the woman she felt she had to be as his partner. Lorelai fights this urge to grow her inn and build an empire, but then makes peace with her destiny.  Being their daughter has been her curse, but I think its something shes ready to embrace.

The Journey Home:  So much of Emily's identity was tied up in her home, her belongings, the ""many things she had carefully chosen"" (quote from Lorelai during the short minimalist phase).  She also found a lot of satisfaction in belonging to the country club and the DAR.  It was nice to see her let these things go as she moved on from being Mrs. Richard Gilmore and found a home in her identity as Emily.  I also think she was able to move on because Lorelai was finally happy and at peace. 	It was interesting to witness Lorelai view Stars Hollow in a new light.  Stars Hollow was the anti-Emily home, and her own house has always been so intentionally different than Emily's.  So much of Lorelai's choices were anti-Emily as opposed to pro-Lorelai.  She liked the kitschy nonsense of Stars Hollow, but maybe a big part of that is that it would've driven her mother batty. Once she let go of that power struggle, she was able to watch the Stars Hollow musical and see it for what it really was-- silly nonsense. It was Wonderland-- a place she made up in her dreams because she just wanted to escape her childhood home.  But she had to realize that if she was going to break from making life choices just to spite her mother, she had to also stop and assess what it was she actually liked, didn't like, and was willing to go along with.
  
Making Peace with the Clich: It was interesting to see Lorelai opening her eyes to how over-the-top silly Stars Hollow could bethe musical being the prime example. I loved that she decided to ""go wild"", and we see that her big, bold move was the clich thing to do.  Lots of women were out on the trail, searching for answers and were open about how they were following the example set for them by the book or movie. Lorelai didn't scoff at this or make fun of it even a little bit, and that was shocking!  She was one of these women, and she owned it. It was such a step of growth for her, I think.

Waiting in Lines and Power Outfits:  When Emily was getting rid of everything in her house that didn't bring her joy, she ended up in Lorelai's old jeans and T-shirt. S he was floundering after Richard's death, and felt she could find joy and peace by becoming Lorelai.  It was then Lorelai who helped her realize she already had an identity and didn't need to wear those clothes. Emily is searching for self-love, acceptance, personal freedom, and an identity without a man, but she's not going to find those things by becoming Lorelai. 
	Rory searches and searches for her ruby red slippers I mean red power dress, and it's been in her mother's closet all along.  The dress didn't work because Rory has yet to find her personal voice and passion, and shes not yet ready to see whats really behind that curtain.  
	When Rory invites Lorelai to join her in NYC, she dives into this mission to analyze the psychology behind standing in long lines.  There are so many people willing to stand in line to get what Lorelai can effortlessly get just like that. I kept thinking, ""why doesn't she write about how Lorelai instead of the people in line?"", and that, of course, is what she ultimately does with the book.  
	Before this epiphany, however, we see Rory deciding to stand in line in an effort to immerse herself in the culture shes studying. Dorothy of Oz dozes in the poppy field before accomplishing the task of killing the wicked witch (a phony assignment), and our Dorothy of Stars Hollow also takes a nap before we see her going too far with her ill-fitted assignment.  Both young women lose their passion and determination during these scenes, and we see Rory grappling with the fact that not only does she flounder and flail in ways that her mother never did, she's also not able to ""get the goods"" by being a compelling, magnetic person that people love saying yes to.   
	Its so hard to stay hopeful at this point, Amy!  You and Daniel sure did a number on Rory.  I know that you want to make the audience see Rory as human as she struggles and searches, but having her sleep with her ex from 8 years ago who is also engaged, all while she experiences failure in her careerits a lot for a fan to handle.  Which brings me to my next point

Amy, do you have something against Alexis Bledel?  I've never heard anything about you having beef with Alexis Bledel, but I'd be willing to bet there's bad blood. I think the whole scene where Serena is trying to get into the DAR was a shot at Alexis (or maybe just Rory).  Serena was never going to sit at the big girls' table, and the snide remarks the DAR gals went totally over her head.  You wrote Rory as a weak character who could never shine as bright as the other two Gilmore girls, and I think you were telling the audience that Alexis didn't even really get that you were doing it (or maybe the message was that Rory hadn't quite figured it out).
	I know that Rory used to be a part of the DAR and she totally rocked it. But I noticed that when they were meeting on Emily's patio and Rory walked out, they all said they had hair appointments at the same time and got the heck out of there.  I don't think they even acknowledged her!  So I guess the DAR is just like all the employers who rejected Rory-- they are communicating that she used to be a star, but just isn't anymore.

And whats with the angst against Millennials?  Rory is written as a typical, floundering, entitled Millennial who moves back into her mom's house.   She thinks she'll easily get a job without any effort, because surely her power dress will be all that's required (insert eye roll).  And if the Serena character isnt a shot at Alexis (and/or Rory), then maybe its a message to Millennials.  And, of course, there's the pathetic ""30-something gang"".  Come on, ASP.  Low blow with that one.
	I dont believe Lorelai is solely responsible for spoiling Rory and creating this floundering Millennial we see in the series.  I think Lorelai parented Rory how she wishes shed been parented, and Emily also took the opportunity to be softer and less controlling.  They were both so anxious to heap encouragement upon Rory that they didnt properly consider how they became such forces of nature, and allow her the space to find that spark within herself.  Rory was the peacemaker between the two women, and it was a huge burden and responsibility.  And what space did Rory have to grieve her grandfathers death?  Lorelai and Emily have such big, overshadowing feelings and reactions.  I dont really understand why Rory doesnt wrestle with the constrictions put on her by these women.

Oh Rory:  I hate to pile it on, but Im so disappointed in Rorys story.
""Where you lead, I will follow. Anywhere that you tell me to""  Lorelai is the leader and Rory is her follower. That's not the dynamic Lorelai ever had with Emily, and I think we see them both struggling with it.  Emily made Lorelai a fighter, and it was iron sharpening iron.  Lorelai didn't sharpen Rory, and Rory did not ever emerge as a fighter. It's my opinion that Rory floundered in Lorelai's shadow for a very long time as she waited for the awesome Gilmore girl genes to kick in.  Emily and Lorelai are forces of nature-- they knew who they were, where they were going, and how they were going to get there. They had well-established homes that they had worked hard on creating.  Rory didn't have any of that focus, and much was made of the fact that she didn't have a home.
	 Lorelai constantly stayed on her mother (she almost never let up!), and she held onto it so tightly, I believe, because she knew that the duels were sharpening her and pushing her towards greatness. I think she was so against Rory writing the book because she felt she'd failed Rory in not pushing her to fight and find her light apart from Lorelai. Lorelai was sad to see Rory come back home, and she had to finally face the fact that SHE is Rory's home. She's Rory's leader and light, and finding a home means being as close to Lorelai as possible, walking in her footsteps, and writing about their life together. 
	Another leader and light in Rorys life is Jess (swoon!).  I like that Jess told her to write the book and then was attracted to her again once she finally owned up to who she was and was not.  Lorelai is Rory's sun and writing the book is her way of facing the light and embracing the warmth and glow; and that's when she finally was able to shine (I know I took that light metaphor and really went with it!).
	 I do think Rory will find her own light/home/voice, but she has chosen to do it by following in Lorelai's footsteps and getting pregnant (with a Gilmore girl, I'm sure!).  We see that Logan gave Rory her own key because he didn't know where they stood, and we see her make a very definitive choice.  Surely Rory didn't consciously plan the pregnancy, but I think it is her destiny.  It makes sense to me.  Not only is everything coming full circle, but I think Rory wants to capture some of the spark her mom has, and is hoping that being a single mom can put her on that path.  When she was talking to Christopher regarding how he felt about Lorelai raising Rory alone, I think we see that he admits that he just wasn't strong enough to be her partner.  That's not true of Logan and Rory (I don't think Logan wanted to commit to her because she lacked self-love and respect).  I do think Rory is hoping the ""force of nature"" tenacity will kick in when she has that baby.  
	I know Im being incredibly harsh on Rory, and giving her very little credit here.  But I dont think we were given a lot to be optimistic about.  Ive only read a couple of recent interviews from you (Amy), and Ive seen that you have spoken a bit about how we should have faith in how smart Rory is, and should focus on her career choices instead of dwelling so much on what guy she ends up with. Thats not the way you wrote it, Amy!  If fans are annoying you with all their team-Jess and team-Logan talk, then you shouldnt have made her love life such a focus.  Own your writing choices and stop rolling your eyes at the fans that are just responding to whats there on the screen.

The Gilmore Girls and Their Friends: The friendships are my favorite part of the show!  Rory has two good friends-- a mini-Emily and a mini-Lorelai.  Lane is a great mom who still pursues her passions and dreams, and she gives Rory a home and good advice.  Paris is an angry, controlling mother who hates that she's warping her children but doesn't know how to stop it.  I love that Rory steps in and spends time with Paris's children.  I think she can really help Paris to be better, just like she encourages Emily to step out and stretch and grow.
	Emily tells us that ""those old bags"" in the DAR are definitely not her friends.  I think we see that she becomes Miss Daisy; her closest friend is a servant of color to whom she is incredibly condescending. Hahhahaha!!  Lorelai is actually her best friend which is why she tricks her into going to therapy once a week, when she most needed her best friend.
	Lorelai's friends are so perfect.  Lorelai tries to pull a Luke with all the ""no suites, no mini-fridges, no fancy chefs! We are who we are, and you'll like it or leave"".  Sooki outgrows this before Lorelai is ready to take that step.  Lorelai learned long ago that if you really love someone, you shouldnt try to control them, so she lets her friends go.  I feel Michel puts his needs and ambitions out there in a healthy way.  He wants to call Lorelai and the Dragonfly home, but insists they both grow and evolve. Lorelai is her father and mother's daughter, and expanding the inn does spark passion in her.  I love that she is who she is in spite of her parents but also because of them... making peace with that is Lorelai's journey.

Giving Emily Affirmation: I sobbed when Lorelai called Emily from the mountain top.  They were in a constant power struggle and telling the story about Richard forgetting her in the steam trunk was a big power play on Lorelai's part.  Emily devoted 50 years of her life to Richard and their marriage, and she had a lot of pride in who he was as a man, the longevity of their marriage, and how well all ofvthat reflected on her. She wanted to bask in that light after his funeral, and Lorelai not only robbed her of that comfort and joy, she embarrassed her and made it look like the man Emily had devoted herself to was a phony.  Lorelai just couldn't let her have that moment, and it wasn't about negative feelings she harbored towards Richard; it was about making Emily feel stupid about the life she'd worked so hard to create for the last 50 years.  She wanted to hit her where it really hurt when she was most vulnerable because the opportunity would never again present itself.  And then, of course, she hated herself for it.  The call from the mountain (IMO) was about affirming Emily and verifying that they life she'd devoted herself to was indeed worthy of praise and respect.  
	When you have a mom that seems so disappointed in you and tries to shame you and knock you down so you'll finally submit to her control, it's hard to pat her on the back and offer words of affirmation. It would feel like defeat and failure UNLESS you finally realize that the mother always saw you as a worthy opponent-- she always saw that you were iron that could sharpen her iron and she knew that making you a fighter would push you to greatness.  If she had thought you were a wimp, she would've left you alone.  The love/hate relationship that would probably never be completely healthy was her dysfunctional way of stirring you up in order to strengthen your resolve.  I think Lorelai is finally able to be grateful to Emily for the part she played in making her as strong as she was, but she was ready to call a truce.  And Emily was finally satisfied with Lorelai (and saw that she had truly found happiness and peace) and could let go. 
	Emily isn't innocent in my eyes, by the way.  She put Lorelai on the spot when she was so vulnerable and raw.  Emily wasn't a ""safe space"" for Lorelai at that time, and hadn't yet earned the right to ask Lorelai to take off her armor.
Lorelai is Lukes Home:  I think Lorelai had to finally deal with the fact that Luke adores her and is just so thankful to be with her.  With Christopher, that was such a turnoff for her.  She didn't want to be so worshiped.  But Luke put it ALL out there when she came back from the trail, and she was ready for it and she handled it like a champ. 
	Emily accused Lorelai of being completely selfish and self-centered with Luke, and it got to her.  Emily pointed out that they lived in her house, Lorelai probably never asked if he wanted kids, they remained unmarried... it was ALL about Lorelai, and that's the way she wanted it.  And then when Luke was pleading with her to not leave him (when she returned from the trail), he owned up to all that Emily had said and made it clear that he was more than okay with it all.  Lorelai made all the rules in the relationship, and he was fine to follow them. She set the boundaries, she set the tone, she was the leader, and he just wanted to keep it going.  He even offered to pursue the restaurant chains if that was the guy she wanted him to be.  That is a huge burden for Lorelai to bear-- to be so adored and followed with such devotion. But she was finally ready to accept it and marry him.  Lorelai is Luke's home and she finally put out the welcome mat. 
	Luke and Christopher are very different in important ways, IMO. Luke has a strong sense of self and sticks to his guns unless it threatens his relationship with Lorelai.  Christopher, on the other hand, happily jokes about how he caved in and went to work for his father. Luke is a tough guy who doesn't like a lot of people, but he adores Lorelai. I think Emily and Richard's relationship was a little like this-- Emily didn't like anyone but worshipped Richard. Despite the fact that Luke lets Lorelai call all the shots and make all the rules, he's strong enough to be her guy... Christopher never was and knows it.
	
        Thats it, ASP.  Thats all Ive got.  Im sure Ive missed so many things, but I dont plan on re-watching The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, or the revival mini-series anytime soon.  I cant devote more time to figuring out why you wrote the way you did, and Im ready to let it go.  Im not one to stand in long lines, and I think I know you well enough now to know some of those lines lead to nothing but two guys eating lunch.  Why did we randomly see Lanes dad?  Who the heck wrote that nasty letter to Emily, and what exactly did it say?  Did Paris and Doyle work things out or get divorced?  Im fine with not knowing these things, and I can have a full, happy life without the knowledge.
	  I deeply respect that this project was a labor of love for you, and Im grateful to you, Daniel, and everyone else who made it happen.  Im sure there were times when you wanted to rework the script so that there were double quotation marks instead of single ones, or so that the authors name had the proper dash in front.  There came a time when you had to let it go.
	I think Ill avoid reading any more interviews youve done or will do in the future.  I hate when the fourth wall comes down (so those Parenthood cameos were painful for me).  I want to imagine you relaxing in a comfortable home, finding new, less destructive ways to torment others with your mean girl sharpness (although I dont think a w'aling museum would be quite your style).  Seriously, though, I read a recent interview today, and it sounded as if you are really grieving over this election, and I want you to know Im sorry and I can empathize.  This wont be the end of the world, though.  I, for one, am so thankful that the revival series came out when it did, because it was what brought me out of my post-election depression.  I was distracted enough by the Gilmore Girls to let go of my election obsession, and Ive thrown myself into this analysis to keep me from sinking back in.  I understand the despair you might be feeling, but please take it easy on your fans.  Playing the Queen of Hearts, the Wicked Witch of the West, or even the Mad Hatter may highlight how much smarter and quick-witted you are than the rest of us, but its not nice.  Telling readers that Rory might choose to have an abortion?  Really?  Theres just no need!
       Oh Amy.  I love you and I truly do thank you for giving us these beautifully developed characters and unforgettable stories.  Will you happily retire, or further develop your empire?  Im rooting for you either way, ASP!

I'm just asking objectively, I'm not really team anyone. I think Jess is the real catch (intelligent, very attractive, loves to read, seems stable now) amongst the men, but that's just my taste, I'm not sure who's best suited for Rory at this point. 

With where they left the storyline in the revival, Rory is pregnant with Logans baby, Logan is with Odette, and Jess still appears to have lingering feelings of some kind for Rory. 

The simplest relationship to form out of these circumstances is obviously Logan/Rory. He drops Odette. They have a family together and live happily ever after. Otherwise, how would Jess/Rory realistically end up with each other if another 4 episodes (a year) were created. I doubt Jess would want to be with Rory while she is pregnant with another mans baby, unless Logan did something horrible to her and she completely ditched him (which is doubtful). Not to mention, Jess simply isn't around, so he'd have to move back to Stars Hollow for anything to work out. It's a similar thing after she has the baby, I doubt Jess would want to be with her then either? Especially since Logan will still be somewhat in the picture as it would be out of character for him to be completely uninvolved. Finally, there's obviously the option that Rory has an abortion and then her path to Jess would be pretty clear, but I don't think that's what she would choose. Rory makes a lot of decisions that surprise me though, so you never know, I guess. ",55,8,False,self,,,,,

When Logan asked Rory to marry him back in season 7, he had their whole life planned out, like where they would live and where they would work. He did not include her life plans and wishes in his idea of their marriage at all. Who does that?

When Lorelai proposed to Luke the first time, she did it because she was in pain and wanted to feel better. Not a great place to start from at all. Then she went on to planning their wedding all on her own. Even though it was obvious that Luke wanted to be involved in the planning process and had his own ideas that he wanted to see included, he was always immediately shut down by Sookie and Lorelai. In the end, it was all Lorelais wedding, not Lukes. I bet that this contributed to the reason why he wanted to postpone it later on; it was just another thing that was pushed on him. He expressed worries that the wedding day was too soon for him when Lorelai told him it was on June 3rd, but since he was not asked before the date was picked, Lorelai did not really care.

When Lorelai asks Luke to marry her for the second time in the revival, one might think that she learned from her past mistakes. But no, she actually expands on them. Her proposal comes from a place of pain and desperation, again. And this time she flat out tells Luke that everything has been already planned without him, that she even chose the date on her own (again), that this is what she wants and he can accept or not. Luke is terrified of losing her, so he accepts. I actually loved Luke and Lorelai in the revival and enjoyed their wedding scene very much, but that proposal was just beyond horrible. 

And both Max and Luke deserve honorary mentions. Max proposed to Lorelai on a whim because he wanted to stop fighting and Christopher wanted to trap her while she still was vulnerable and single. 

The only proposal/marriage done right was Sookie and Jacksons. He proposed, she accepted and they planned their wedding together just the way they both wanted to (after she ditched crazy Emily that is). ",35,51,False,self,,,,,

Anyway, are we really supposed to see here that Rory = Lorelai? I completely agree that Lorelai (and Emily) are forces of nature. But is Rory? Particularly the one we've seen in this revival? The entire series we've seen her completely floundering. Are we supposed to think that once Rory becomes a mother, she'll regain her ""force of nature"" ways? Do y'all think ""force of nature"" even describes her OS personality well?

- She convincingly dismisses the rumours that she dislikes Scott Patterson (made me happy, I didn't want the L&amp;L illusion ruined)

- She talks about the final four words (interesting because in her new book she claims she didn't know anything about it until the revival - I guess it's something else she forgot over the years)

I thought it'd weigh down the tread so I decided to separate this.

Let it be known.  Some of you are going to hate me.  That's fine.  Tell me I'm wrong.  This is how I see it. 8)

My initial comment: Rory's a hurricane. She leaves devastation in her wake.

Being a force of nature isn't necessarily a good thing.

Edit: Also I think people are taking the full circle a little too rigidly. It's the circle of life. I mean it's integral. You are born. You grow up. You search for love. You have a kid. You grow old you die. There's a lot that's similar. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree is axiomatic truth that built on solid ground. Many of us don't like to see our parents in us, because it's a natural process to rebel. It's very human. It's very much there though. She's selfish. She flounders. She has an eccentric way of speaking and living.

To me it's like this. A woman will get mad at her boyfriend and say, ""You're not listening."" And the Guy will say, ""Yes I am. You just told me your coworker called you a bitch.""

See, the guy is saying. Of course I was listening. The words that came out of your mouth just came back out of my mouth. As if I'd stored them down there and they echoed back. Word for word. How can you say I'm not listening?

The Woman gets mad and storms off and calls her best friend to tell her that guy never listens to her. She wants him to hear what she's saying emotionally. To connect with her, not with the factuality of her words. She wants a harmony of the heart, not a guy taking notes in the back of the classroom.

To me, ASP is saying that Logan and Christopher are both B flats, but one is on a keyboard and one is on saxophone. Lorelai and Rory are both F sharps, but one's on a Xylophone and one's on a Ukulele. 

u/fat_amiee 's reply: Beautiful analysis but I have no idea what it means. LOL. Are you saying Christopher never connected with Lorelai on an emotional level and ASP wants us to believe Logan didn't as well? 

My thoughts: Haha.  No.  My point was that ASP is speaking about Logan being Christopher on a level of harmony, whereas some viewer are getting very flustered and hearing her very literally.  This happens all the time.  In fact, it happens in Gilmore where--most notoriously--the same words are interpreted by Emily and Lorelai in radically different ways.

Now, if you want me to get into who Logan and Christopher are, well, let's see.  They both grew up rich and got kicked out of every boarding school they ever enrolled in.  They also wore those expulsions like badges of honor.  (That sounds vaguely incestuous given Logan's sister, but we shall sally forth)  They drink when they're unhappy or feel competitive over a Gilmore.  They both have domineering Fathers that they essentially always lose to.  Part of the reason they both have domineering Fathers is because they're jackasses.  They throw around their entitlement and spend the money or waste it or sink a ship or get arrested or get some girl pregnant.  Their fathers are no nonsense and they are all nonsense.  This is essentially their rebellion.  All their victories are cheap.  

""Oh, yay! We pulled off a rip-roaring little coup,' they say, and then they march right back into Dad's good fortunes.  

Logan says he doesn't see a way out.  Well, he does of course.  It just doesn't have any of the perks.  And those perks.  Mmm, boy, believe you me, he loves those perks.  In fact, take away those perks and who is he?  They're both busy gallivanting off to nowhere and they're hoping you don't notice that without all the spectacle that their Daddy-backed wallet brings there's little substance.  In fact, you see that with Christopher.  He always has a scheme that never quite works out.  He needs a Grandfather to die to find stability, and then he gets right in line with where he was always supposed to be.  I'd bet Logan's last ten years look similar except he didn't last as long.  He moved away because he made a bad investment.  Well, how much you want to bet he didn't fuck up some more?  But he's got big ideas for his Dad's money.  Of course he does.  

Compare Logan sitting with Jess to Christopher at Emily's wedding.  Lots of drinking.  Lots of animal posturing.  Pugnacity or the mention of it.  The difference being that Logan had Rory and Christopher didn't have Lorelai.  

Cheating.  Christopher is with Sherry, drops into town and sleeps with Lorelai.  Logan is about to be married, swoops into town, makes an event, and sleeps with Rory.  

They're together.  Lorelai questions Christopher.  ""So, Gonna tell her you're moving out?""  He's evasive.  Sherry is pregnant.  Rory is with Logan.  ""Are you really going to marry Odette?"" she asks.  ""That's the dynastic plan.""
Ooh, daddy's plan.  That's sexy and independent.

Christopher: this isn't how it was supposed to happen.
Logan: I didn't like how we ended things.

C: I dont know. I just. . . I dont like how things are.
C: I didnt want things to turn out this way!
L: I don't like this.
L: The problem is youre here with Robert and its bothering me, and I dont like that its bothering me.


C: Yeah, I didnt want to upset anybody. I wanted last night to be nice. 

L: Yes, you did, don't make me feel guilty for your drinking and partying, that's your choice, I'm not forcing you, when I ask you out, you can say no!
L: I didn't tell you to quit Yale! You did that! I gave you one month, you went beyond a month, it had nothing to do with me, it was all you! Now, you wanna change, change it, but don't blame me, don't you dare blame me!
C:Whats wrong? Dammit Lorelai, youre dumping fifteen years of unhappiness on me? Fifteen years of not having healthy, lasting relationships on me? Youre blaming me for breaking up with Max and not marrying him? Thats all my fault?

Three letter nickname
C: Lor
L: Ace

LORELAI: I was just thinking, you know, all these years, no matter what my relationship status has been, whether Ive been dating or hibernating or whatever, I think Ive always had you in the back of my mind - you know, the prospect of us being together. But this prospect was sort of indefinitely on hold while you, you know, found yourself and, uh, got your personal life together so that you could really be there for me and especially for Rory. But you and I have been so linked in my mind that I think I have unconsciously sabotaged every decent relationship Ive had, including the one with Max, because I was waiting for you, and I shouldnt have been. And now that I see that, and I see you settling down with Sherry, I think I can move beyond it.

Rory... well, ten years later she's still hooking up with Logan and looking with longing eyes and lying to her mother about it etc.

Chris tries to make up his absence by buying a Oxford Dictionary.
Logan tries to make up for his indiscretions by buying a coffee cart and flowers.  

Christopher doesn't tell Lorelai that his business is failing.  She finds out when his credit card is declined.

Logan doesn't tell Rory that she's walking into a room of girls he just recently rolled through like a bowling ball through pins.  


So, if I had to guess what Amy is showing us, it's that they are both exciting for the same reason that they can't be depended on.  They are impulsive to the extent that they have no foundation and become aimless by virtue of bouncing off the walls as it were.  Think about that line in the Revival.  

R: One thing I can honestly say is that I was never bored with you.

L: Yeah.  We're good like that. 

That sentence speaks volumes.  One thing I can *honestly* say.  Okay.  So lies or at the very least lies of omission are the foundation of this relationship.  They have a you don't owe me I don't owe you relationship of deceit.  But what's worse is that Logan takes it as a point in favor of them and misses just how damning it is.

Another line that speaks volumes.  

R: We had a deal.  You don't owe me anything.  
L: Technically no. 

Think about it.  Logan could say, ""Fuck our deal.  Fuck what I owe you.  I love you woman, and I'm tired of this bullshit runaround.  Either trust me, trust that I love you and risk everything on me and we'll find our future, cause I'd rather lose every dollar my dad owns then spend another day away from you.  So either trust me or let's just end this, because I don't want to keep dipping our toes in this water.  The water's stagnant.  It's dirty because it hasn't changed for ten years.  No more fail safes.  All or nothing, Rory.  Now which is it?  Jump in with both feet, or wash our hands of each other and walk away.""

Instead he took the fucking point.  Fuck that.  And he took it in the most pansy way ever.  Grow some balls.  

But here's the thing.  Logan can't get his head out of his ass because he's always looking at the scoreboard.  And the game is Logan.  No one else is involved.  He's trying to know that he's winning against the world.  Rory's hurt because he slept with all those girls.  So what's the point he's making?  

L:So then, if you believe that, that I thought we weren't together, then do you believe that, in my mind, I was not cheating on you?

That's right.  His main point is that he's infallible.  

Hell, even when he loses Dad's money and has to come up with his own plan, he doesn't consult Rory.  He decides that Rory is going to fit into his life where he wants her and proposes without even discussing this future.  Because it's his future.  Ours is a pronoun he doesn't recognize.  He gets to date other people but doesn't like it when Rory shows up with another guy.  He doesn't want to do a relationship until Rory's going to break it off.  'Did no one tell this girl, who I call kiddo, ace, and my lucky charm when I'm betting and she's fallen asleep from boredom, that my name is Huntzberger and I don't lose?!'


And when you get down to it that's Logan and Christopher's problem.  They care more about an invisible scoreboard then about where they're going or who's on the journey with them.  They're both man-baby's who are interested in having fun.  In fact, the most romantic thing about them is their having fun.  But one day you realize that that's not so much romantic as irresponsible.  They're goofs.  How do you trust someone who's more concerned with enjoyment and winning then with going after what they want.  How do you fall for a man who can see nothing but the door his dad is pushing him through.  Eventually the magic carriage you're ridding in turns back into a pumpkin and it's time to catch your flight because the fiance is in town.  You're not part of the dynastic plan.  And maybe, if you're like Lorelai, you don't even want to be, because you don't want to walk through that door with them.  Besides, there's no striking of the clock quite like a pregnancy.  But if you ever met a guy who always tried to fix things and put the important things first, who even when he faltered did so because he put family first, well then, if he led you to a door, you might just open it.

Is there any point watching the revival or just call it a day?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5h84ec/i_made_it_to_season_6_and_i_cant_take_rory/,Aethelu,1481217326,"I just finished episode 5 of season 6 and after reading several posts here about Rory, it sounds like she doesn't improve.

I was too young to really enjoy it when it was on tv, but I remembered liking it and hearing about a revival thought I'd binge through.

I unfortunately started from season 4 because I know I finished season 3 a year or so ago.

Rory was ok to begin with. Until I started to realise that she took everything in her life for granted and enjoyed people doting on her far too much. She's very happy for people to believe she's a sweet heart, but she's actually quite selfish and treats her mum poorly.

I empathise with Lorelai with her toxic parents. It doesn't make them bad people, but they aren't good for her and she's spent a lot of time setting up healthy boundaries and trying not to demonise them to Rory. Rory repays her by breaking all of her mum's boundaries because she likes her rich grandparents and gets to be the favourite. There is a lot Lorelai never tells Rory to protect her relationship with Emily and Richard, but instead of trusting her mum Rory decides that, no she likes how they treat her, so continues to force Lorelai's hand with them and even moves in with them when she leaves Yale.

The way she treats Dean is appalling. She holds onto Dean just in case she doesn't want to take the plunge with Jess. Then she treats Jess and Dean pretty badly by continuing a friendship with Dean. Young people make mistakes, but I'm amazed at how old Rory is when she makes them.

People keep saying she's mature but I can't see any evidence of maturity so far. So she likes books and doesn't particularly enjoy drinking... Plenty of successful and happy people in their later years continue to drink like they're 18 years old and there's nothing wrong with it. Rory behaves like a child and treats other's as if she's not been on the earth for 20 years to have learned better.

The big thing of ""sex"" is infuriating. Lorelai understandably seems to be wondering when it will happen and is of course disappointed when it's with a married Dean. Lorelai tries to talk sense into Rory but obviously gives up because the delicate Rory ""hates"" her mum for being honest. Dean is the married one so it's more on him than anyone, but that Rory later wont listen to reason and goes to Europe with Emily of all people. Rory has no understanding of loyalty. I do like watching Emily as a character and at a distance find her funny but also infuriating and toxic. Also Rory openly discusses Dean's marriage and what he's told her with Lane so that Dean's wife hears! Perhaps if they were somewhere private, but the lack of consideration is dumb.

Rory drives wedges between Lorelai and her parents but seems to think that it's okay because it's for her. And now in the beginning of season 6 she's embracing this life of Emily's despite knowing it's vapid and entitled. One minute she's talking with the maid and helping her and the next she's bowing her head to her gran and acting as though she was doing something wrong.

At least Lane has the strength of character and her convictions. And don't get me started on how for granted she takes Lane. Lane doesn't have a single role in Rory's life by season 6, she doesn't attend the vow renewal even though Rory has been to all of Lane's family weddings. I know Rory puts Lane up for a bit in her dorm, but I was genuinely surprised when Rory cried about missing Lane, until I realised it was purely because she missed how well Lane held her together, not Lane the person.

Again, I empathise with Lane when she's out on her own and trying to survive without relying on other's. What Lane does by getting a job and living with her band mates is a HUGE contrast to what Rory does upon leaving Yale and living in her grandparents pool house and wanting not to get a job because of community service being full time hours. The several layers of entitlement there are infuriating.

Lane doesn't let anyone even her mum deter her from her band and she gets back up when she's knocked down and battles through her difficult relationship with her mum. You would think Lane would be the one to behave as though she led a sheltered life, but it's actually Rory who is sheltered, bubble wrapped and behaves likes a 15 year old at the age of 20. What Lane is dealing with is far greater than what Rory is dealing with and yet Rory tbh couldn't care less.

That every guy Rory likes is actually the great love of her life is fickle. With Logan it's as though she enjoys that he gave up a life of a player to be with her and that makes her special. Because Rory loves nothing more than being everyone's special something, why else would she put up with Paris who calls her her only best friend.

I know someone who also ""falls in love"" with every man she's with, and that person has had 4 husbands.

It's as if Rory was brought up to be like a self-centered version of Lorelai but her nature is to be fickle and vapid. Logan suits Rory because they are both entitled, spoiled, and tbh annoying as hell.

I really think that the show has been run into the ground for me. I like the town characters and I want to see more of them, I want Luke to be less one dimensional like he seemed to be in the past, I want more of Lane.


OMG and Richard! I completely forgot that bastard. He appears to be a nice warm grandpa, but he's actually a master manipulator and can turn his empathy off just like Emily. He defends his wife and her actions no matter how much they harm his own child. I agree with being loyal to your spouse, but not at the expense of your own offspring, they should come first. He's not as funny as Emily and so the moment he's not nice Richard is the moment he's just... An asshole.

Rory has no strength of character because tbh she's rich granma and grandpa's special snowflake and particularly delicate. Her academic performance is always unbelievable to me, the valedictorian thing was just silly. Someone who crumbles so easily could not put themselves in a position to work so hard so successfully. We all know the highly capable person who freaks out and does badly in the exam, or the person who works hard but just isn't capable. What Logan's dad said to her is made out to be a really horrible thing, and it would be crushing, but why on earth should he sugar coat, she should have declined the opportunity or have the conviction that even if it didn't work out there she'd have given herself something amazing to put on her CV as a graduate. Instead she expected him to love her as much as everyone else does and for that reason fluff her ego, deservingly or not. It never crossed her mind she wasn't deserving of his praise until it happened and therefore shattered her.

So... Does she also completely ruin the revival? Or is it worth watching for Lorelai and Luke and Emily. Is Lane there? She's probably been completely irrelevant to the main characters for 15 years but I like her.

But I wonder, is it really the infidelity or is it mostly because you ship Rory with someone else? (Jess, Dean or new guy) I ask this because infidelity is a very common trope amongst some of the biggest OTPs on television. Some examples below. 

* Ross/Rachel- The infamous ""we were on a break!!"" argument
* Blair/Chuck-Blair cheated on Louis with Chuck and I'm sure others but I can't remember right now. 
* Meredith/McDreamy (Derek)-Derek was married while hooking up with Meredith on season 2 of Grey's Anatomy. 
* Roger/Joan on Mad Men
* Olivia/Fitz on Scandal 
* Will/Alicia Florick-Alicia was still married when she was with Will

I feel like infidelity is used so frequently that it has been diluted into a simple dramatic obstacle to keep couples separated. So why is it a nail in some couples coffins and just a nuisance in others? Just curious.

I'd like for there to be another installment, mainly to do some justice to Rory's story, as I see her having three major things up in the air:

1.) career
2.) baby
3.) relationship

So it's easy to think that everything is bad and her life is a disaster. However, they also planted hints that all three will be ok, too:

1.) career - her book. She says the first few chapters flew out. Impossible to say how it'll turn out for sure, but I think it fits her love of reading better than journalism does.

2.) baby - the talk with her dad. It basically gave her the strength to know that whether she goes it alone or not, she'll be ok.

3.) relationship - the look from Jess...and Logan's continued presence, if you prefer him.

So while I'd like more, I think they've given us enough to think that she'll probably figure things out, too.

However - if they did decide to do more, while Rory's story is obvious, I think there would be some good stuff for Lorelai and Emily too, as they go through interviews with Rory for the book, they both have developments in their careers (Emily w/ the whales and Lorelai expanding the inn), etc. We could also see more Lane and Paris, as I think both stories are ripe to re-visit.

Were they maybe trying to force their own hand if the natural consequence of unprotected sex happened?

Or another perspective, Rory is unsatisfied w/ her life. Is she intentionally playing Roulette? Has all of her and Logan's intercourse been unprotected? If she was on the pill, how did she get pregnant ( I know multiple ways, but it's not spelled out in the series)? Was she relying on Logan to use protection and he got carried away in the moment? Is he using protection with Odette who is pictured sleeping in his bed? Did Rory use protection with Wookie man or Paul?

Or maybe Rory who claims she is too poor for underwear just couldn't pay for her pills or an IUD or her method of choice.

But people are sceptical, and understandably so. 

If it comes back, I think it's quite important that it's not with the same format as AYITL. The structure was unnatural, gave the story little room to breathe, and it felt like cameos and meta-references took precedence over a real script. It was ""A fun throwback to Stars Hollow!"" rather than a distinct *show*. This is just about acceptable for a one-off revival, but if it comes back they need to approach it more like a real series, with normal-length episodes (maybe 10, or something like that) and a gradually developed story. It should only be with characters that can commit properly. For example, if Liza Weil and Milo Ventimiglia don't have time to play full roles - that's a shame, but accept it. Don't shovel them in just for the fun of it. Develop new characters instead, ones that can have a proper arch.

That's my take: personally I don't need everyone from the original cast involved. It doesn't need to be a carbon copy of the OS - I'm happy to adapt to a slightly new Gilmore Girls. 

BUT it seems like the production team are scared of this, and I suppose I don't blame them. They're probably right that a chunk of the fandom wouldn't accept it - ""it's not Gilmore Girls without Sookie!"", for example. It ends up self-defeating though; if you're eager for the show to be as close to the OS as possible, it's inevitably going to be disappointing.  ""Yay Logan!"", but at the same time ""It's silly that Rory hasn't moved on in 9 years"". Well....what did you expect? You know? (I'm not specifically targetting this sub, to be clear; people here are generally more level headed)

If fans want a decent show, I think they need to be willing to adapt to a ""different Gilmore Girls"". If that's difficult, they should probably stick to rewatches because frankly, we'll never have the original series back. If the production team genuinely feel that they can't make the show work with substantial changes? Well, then fair enough, let's leave it there.

Lorelai tells her that they're her clothes, implying that they're from her teenage years.

There's one little problem with this scenario. The brand Candie's wasn't even established until 1981 (when Lorelai was about 13), and was just a shoe line for over a decade. They didn't start making clothes until 1993 (when Lorelai would be about 25, and long out of both her teenage years and her parents' home). 

This bothered me enough to begin with, but then... In an [interview with Brenda Maben](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/gilmore-girls-trailer-emily-gilmore-t-shirt-kelly-bishop-costume-designer), a costume designer for the show, she says ""about that vintage-looking Candies T-shirt: 'We made it...It didnt really exist. But Candies was gracious enough to let us use [the logo].'""

So not only is this shirt anachronistic in the GG timeline, but it's something they went out of their way to create. 

It's perhaps the smallest issue with the revival, but it symbolizes everything that was wrong with the revival to me.

Brought to you by u/Ufocola.  Written by u/Phanes_Protogonos.

Fall episode.  

A week after leaving Oz's bed and breakfast, Rory gets invited to a Conde Nast event and heads into New York.  On the way there, she decides she needs to finally break up with Paul, so she tells him she's headed in for this big event and asks if he can get dinner beforehand, but he's already made plans.  She grabs a bite with a Brooklyn friend and heads off to the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel.  It's peppered with Celebrities and Industry big wigs like Anna Wintour and Nicolas Ghesquire.  Rory misses a text message and fails to see that Paul's night fell through and he's decided to head over and join her.  Rory is working the room and talking to an editor when she catches sight of Logan talking to a few fashion models.  Rory runs up unseen and says, ""How dare you not tell me your in town,"" and kisses Logan.  Unfortunately, Paul has just walked in and sees this.  That's not all.  One of said models is Odette.  The two jilted lovers proceed to crush their worse halves with vehement verbal lashings for the cold, heartless, harpy bastards that they are. After the scene, Logan suggests a meeting with the bartender.  After a few bottoms up drinks, the two take a silent elevator to Logan's Hotel room and make struck-dumb love. Rory begins to tear up immediately afterwards. Logan notices and says, ""Hey Ace,"" and grabs her hand, his wedding ring clinking against her bracelet. They stare at it for a moment, then a space grows between them and he pulls off the ring and places it on the bedside table.  On separate sides of the bed the two gaze off into an indistinct middle distance in teary-eyed misery, forced to confront the abject horror of their actions, replaying Odette and what's his name's cutting words in their mind, completely unprepared and unsure of the future. Fade out.

1) Skill at writing articles does not = skill at writing novels. Most writers spend years learning to write novels or long format non-fiction well, and have several manuscripts stuffed away in a trunk somewhere that will never see the light of day.

2) The overwhelming majority of novel writers make little to no money from their writing - even over their whole career. The idea that Rory 'needs' to write this book to succeed is laughable because...

3) Even for established writers, memoirs are an incredibly hard sell - outside of celebrity tell-alls, the market is tiny and already filled with every kind of hardship known to man. In comparison to the stories of abuse, poverty, drugs, sex, rock'n'roll etc etc out there, Rory has led an entitled, vanilla life. Lorelai is no different. A 16 year old pregnant girl is nothing in the memoir market - it's simply not an interesting enough story. It probably wouldn't sell at all.

And I know the focus of the book is their relationship - but outside of Stars Hollow, that story just isn't interesting. Think about it, the show works because of the fast talking actors and the way they bring the words to life. I'm not sure how many of us would read Gilmore Girls in novel format...

But let's say Jess got his press to publish it (which would save Rory having to query for an agent, query for a publisher, and actually get offered a contract) that still doesn't guarantee it will sell to the public.

So why does this bother me? Because the show did something awesome by acknowledging how Rory picked a difficult career and therefore didn't enjoy the level of success everyone expected for her. 

She picked journalism and failed - that's a brave choice for a family show. But then they undo all that by giving her an even more unrealistic goal and then pretending that this will be what changes her life.

Okay so first of all, it's just so ungodly unrealistic that Rory would consistently forget the existence of her boyfriend of two years for an entire year. I've had all kinds of less than stellar moments with guys I was dating where maybe I would forget about my plans with them, or not treat them super great, but these were never people I agreed to be in a relationship with and they certainly weren't people I had been calling my boyfriend for two years. It was funny that Lorelai and Luke forgot who he was, but it's just so unbelievable and so unlike Rory that I personally think it breaks any sense of believability that Rory's love life might have had in the revival. 

And I'm perplexed as to why ASP felt like this would be a worthwhile addition to Rory's storyline. Most of the audience is far more worried about the far from stable thing she has going on with Logan, so why would we need to see that Rory is not only part of an affair, but she is actively cheating too?  Considering Paul is presented as such a nonentity that it seems like the audience isn't supposed to be worried about Rory's cheating, it seems like a weird choice. But if it's used as a way to equalize Rory and Logan, then that weakens the point that Logan's cheating is something the audience should hold against him. 

I can't help but feel like ASP heard about ghosting and just assumed that this not only applied to people in relationships spanning years but also to a character like Rory who has always been more traditional in her approach to dating. 

And then of course with all of Rory's storyline, it's even more upsetting that we are just thrown into so many scenarios with Rory, that seem so far removed from the girl we knew in 2007, yet we are given no understanding of how she came to be this way. And I think it's ridiculous that she couldn't be bothered to have us jump into Luke and Lorelai raising a kid together, but has no problem changing Rory's core values without the slightest bit of backstory.

Let me explain. [Possible Revival spoilers--although I don't think they're big.]

Rory is lazy, acts snooty and condescending to a blogger whom she feels is beneath her, complains about not having money while being a trust fund baby, cheats on her boyfriend, has sex with several married men, judges her mother harshly for doing normal things (clipping coupons). 

How are we supposed to react to Rory's shitty behavior? I think there are three options:

1. She's misunderstood and is really a good person.

2. The show isn't about an unrealistic role model--it's about a real human being.

3. The show is about a bad person.

If #3, the show is quite interesting. It's a moral tale about how Lorelai's parenting strategy of being more of a friend and less of an authority turns Rory into a shitty person. However, #3 wasn't ASP's intention. In fact, ASP has made her feelings about Rory very clear: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/gilmore-girls-revival-creator-final-four-words-951693. ASP says Rory did the wrong thing because her life was ""a mess."" Um, I'm sorry, I've dealt with much bigger messes and didn't do the shitty things that Rory did; that's true of many, many other people. ASP's more detailed response really drives the point home: ASP herself is a bad person.

""And it never quite felt like that for us because we were playing Rory in a bit of denial about everything in her life. She was in denial about what her career was, in denial that her living situation was less than delightful and in denial about what her romantic life was. Some people go through times in their lives when they don't make the best choices. It doesn't mean they're bad people, it just means that's a particularly weird time that they're going through and later on, when they're old, they can sit there and go, 'Wow, I was kind of a dick for those six months.'""

So Rory was kind of a dick for six months but isn't a bad person. Um, ok. Cheating on a boyfriend, sleeping with married men, complaining about money when there's a huge trust fund available, not taking decent-paying work because you think it's beneath you, not knowing how to perform at a job interview--this isn't being kind of a dick for six months (especially because these events span years). It's being spoiled, demanding, and irresponsible.

What drives me nuts about all this is that Rory's behavior is more easily explained than ASP's flimsy explanation. Rory is an entitled, selfish bitch. A pretty girl from a rich background who ends up in a prestigious career (that she then fucks up due to her own wishy-washy lack of discipline) and fucks married men and cheats on her boyfriend is not a misunderstood good person and is not a real human being. It's a bad person. Yet ASP pretty clearly wants us to think that the show is about a ""real person"". She thinks real people are bad people, and I'm assuming she thinks this way because she herself is a bad person.

I really hate Girls because it's a show about entitled bitches being entitled bitches. But Lena Dunham et al. never denied that and at least had the decency to admit that it's about shitty people. ASP doesn't do that--she tries to justify the unjustifiable. I can't help but think ASP is just a horrible human being, and I'm glad I'll never meet her.",66,79,False,self,,,,,

Here are some of my main problems...

Rory:
1. Despite arriving at Chilton later than Paris and seemingly working just as hard she gets into all of her top choice schools while Paris is denied. She also is named valedictorian which just seems unrealistic to me since she had a rough start at Chilton (getting D's on her papers etc...). She, so far, has had two really hot boyfriends who fought over her and would have done basically anything just to be with her. It just seems like Rory gets everything she ever wants, and when she doesn't she pouts about it endlessly. I think that's also why she was taken so off guard when she asked out that boy in the Yale laundry room and he said no. She's used to guys fawning over her, and so when he didn't she seemed surprised. (I forgot to mention Tristan too)

3. They way that Rory strung Dean along really bothered me and was selfish. It was obvious from the very beginning that her and Jess had chemistry, and when it got more serious between them she could have at least done Dean the decency of breaking up with him. He was pretty good to her and didn't deserve that in my opinion.

2. Her ""homebody"" attitude annoys me. I get that not everyone feels the need to party in college but I just PERSONALLY don't like how she does nothing but read and sit in her dorm room. Also, I was happy to see that when on the Spring break trip her and Paris didn't watch a freaking movie and actually went to a party. This is a little bit less of an issue than the other things for me. Oh, and for example how on Rory's FIRST night at college her mom spends the night in her dorm with her. That a little excessive to me.

3. She visits home so much. I get that Yale is less than an hour away from Stars Hollow, but it seems like she is there every other day. I don't know if this is just a plot device for the show, but I feel as if the show is still ""Rory in Stars Hollow"" and not really ""Rory at Yale"". 

Lorelai: 

1. I get that her parents are crappy sometimes, but honestly she over plays the whole ""woe-is-me"" act. Just because she is independent doesn't mean that she has to hate her parents so much. She is so stubborn, like when she needed a loan to fix the termite problem and refused to borrow money from Emily, even though it was ultimately in the best interest for her family because her home was at stake. I just think that Lorelai has a lot of pride. 

2. Her and Luke just need to date already. This tension has gone on for too long.

3. She never shuts up. Sometimes I get a headache from trying to keep up with the witty pop culture references or just processing her sentences in my head. And when she's talking to Rory it's the worst because they go on and on and on talking in this ""language"" of joking/sarcasm/wittiness that is exhausting. 

4. She's selfish as hell. She somehow finds a way to make everyone else's problems about her. Like when Luke was going through a rough patch with his marriage to Nicole, Lorelai got so upset when she found out that Luke was moving, even though it really had nothing to do with her life.

Both of them are just really self centered and selfish in my opinion and it seems as if all of the supporting characters will do anything for them, even if they don't deserve it. 

As for the supporting characters like Sooki, Luke, and Lane I really like all of them and I think that's why I keep watching the show. Overall, I enjoy the show but sometimes they just do stuff that gets on my nerves. What's your opinion? ",38,42,False,self,,,,,

I was thirteen in 2005.  I'd catch reruns and I'd sit and watch them and I really loved Rory.  She was my hero.  I loved how she was so smart and pretty and loved to read and really cared about school and wanted to go to Harvard.  I also loved that she loved writing and wanted to be a journalist.  I was a lot like her in those ways.  I loved reading and writing and wanted to be a journalist so naturally Rory was my idol.  She was the first teenage girl I'd seen on TV who wasn't off having sex or cutting class or doing drugs.  It was refreshing.

When I was sixteen is when I finally got a chance to watch the entire show start to finish.  That's when I started disliking Rory.  I hated how spoiled she was.  I hated how Lorelai and all of Stars Hollow made it like the world revolved around Rory and the sun shone out of her ass.  Because of that Rory grew up believing just that, that she was some perfect special little princess and expected everyone to treat her as such.
  I hated how she treated Dean, how she strung him along when she wanted Jess and then lost her virginity to him while knowing he was married and not even separated from Lindsay at that point.
  I hated how she'd throw a huge fit whenever someone didn't kiss her ass or when something didn't go her way.  Mitchum gave her some negative feedback and instead of working hard to prove him wrong, she throws a complete fit by stealing a yacht, fighting with her mom for MONTHS, dropping out of school, and mooching off Emily and Richard while getting wasted with Logan and his stupid friends every night.
  I hated how she tried using Jess to cheat on Logan to get back at Logan for hurting her.  I get you're hurt, but don't go hurting someone who really cares for you for revenge. 
 I hated how she turned down that writing job she got after graduation from Yale because she was so sure she was going to get that unpaid Fellowship internship. 
 I hated how she treated her friends.  She seemed to give zero fucks about Lane and Lane's problems as soon as she started dating Dean and attending Chilton.  Paris really loved Rory and was a good friend to her, but throughout their college years Rory would tell everyone who would listen that Paris ""wasn't really her friend.""  

And don't even get me started about how much I hated her in the revival.

I'm 25 now and am just appalled by how this character turned out.  ASP could've made Rory a huge inspiration to teen girls (like she was to me) instead of turning her into a whiny, selfish, entitled brat who does terrible things all the time.  

I also hate the excuse I get whenever I talk about hating Rory.  ""Oh, she was young and going through some issues so she made some poor decisions.""  Um, okay.  I've gone through WAY worse crap than Rory and I've never done any of the stupid shit she does.  I've made some mistakes and have some regrets, but I've never committed a felony or slept with multiple taken men all the while knowing they were taken.

I get ASP wanted to make Rory a little more ""real"" because she was almost ""too perfect"" in the first season, but couldn't you have given her some normal flaws?  Most women aren't out and about sleeping with married and engaged men repeatedly, stealing yachts, or getting knocked up with their engaged lover's love child at 32.

In ""The Fundamental Things Apply"" Lorelei pushes Rory to date casually as she had always been in relationships. She makes a point ""you're in college now, what else is there for you to do other than date"" and encourages her to date the guy that Rory doesn't see wanting a relationship with.
Then when Rory casually dates Logan, Lorelei makes a big deal about how she is a relationship girl and Rory makes a point in Pulp Friction that they're dating, it doesn't have labels and they can date other people, saying ""its college"" and Lorelei acts like its wrong for her daughter to be acting like that. 
Maybe its just that she is dating Logan but it seems that Lorelei does this a lot, like she needs to give advice that Rory listens to. She makes a comment to Luke about having the mom card when Rory was in high school and living at home and now she doesn't hold as much sway and power over her (we would fight but in the morning I controlled the coffee and the pop tarts and she had to talk to me) and 'Rory is dating girl now' in a tone that tells a lot about what she thinks of the situation.

I am torn about the wedding proposal and was wondering what input you could give me. The proposal really felt like a Max-move. You know, season 1 finale ""will you marry me"" just to fix a problem. I'm struggling with the fact that Luke and Lorelai don't fix their lying to each other and other communication issues before they decide to get marry.

Both Lorelai's proposals (season 6 finale and in fall) felt weird somehow. 

This is just me but I don't feel like Luke and Lorelai have to get married. But if they do, it should've been done right. Not only didn't we see Emily walk Lorelai down the isle because the budget was gone (priorities, ASP!), but all romantic aspects of the wedding were done by Kirk of all people...

I'm rambling now, but, with fixing their issues I was hoping for a moment in which Lorelai really makes herself vulnerable because she never could but can be with Luke, and they connect on a deeper, emotional level where they talk about where their behavior and feelings come from.

So Rory grew up with Christopher pretty much out of the picture, and that has a lot of effect on kids growing up. I can attest to that having only had 1 parent in my life throughout a lot of my growing up. I think it's possible that Rory, knowing the effect not having her dad in her life had, sought out Christopher to pick his brain about why he was so absent, and gain insight to the mindset, seeing as the father of her baby is probably Logan, who would likely have a limited, if any, relationship with said baby.

This got me thinking. What would've been a better project for Rory than this weird, likely-to-fail memoir of a nobody? Being an advisor like her Grandpa!  

Sure, Stars Hollow resisted when she took the poem of the frontpage of the newspaper. But she did get the ball running again. In this age of dying papers and struggling journalists, it would've been the perfect resolution for Rory to start an organization for the saving of small town journalism. It all could've been tied up nicely, as well, with her aspiring to be as successful as her grandfather after his retirement and using her inheritance as a stepping stone (which, as we find out, she had avoided to touch out of respect for Richard / shame that she would live off of her family's money at 32, even though her Mom had always been so independent, even when pregnant as a teenager).  

Rory has always had great organizational skills and I can see her as a coordinator more so than as a writer. She would use her experience and fresh ideas to revive dead newspapers and make them relevant again. That way, she would be overcoming not only her ""rut,"" but would find a new, steady purpose in life that won't be over after two years at the maximum (like this book we got instead).

I'm on the first episode, and it is honestly so hard to wrap my head around the idea that the first time we meet Lorelai, she's the same age that Rory is when the revival starts. Her and Rory are complete polar opposites at 32. Season 1 Lorelai is managing an inn, actively working to get Rory into Chilton, worrying about tuition, keeping up a house, and doing other mom stuff like hemming Rory's clothes. She has it all so together (regardless of the first conflict of the show, not being able to pay for Chilton herself), she's successful, and she's thriving. 

Rory, on the other hand, as we all know, is a mess that can't get a job, doesn't have a house, may or may not own a car, may or may not be broke, and is running back and forth to London to sleep with her engaged secret boyfriend. Its so disappointing to see Rory failing and flopping over and over when her mom had everything together. 

Maybe since Rory never had to grow up at the age of 16 and raise a baby, she didn't ever really stop being a teenager like her mom had to. It's kind of sad to me that Lorelai gave up an important part of her life for Rory, raising her and teaching her not to end up like she did, only for Rory to be having a premature midlife crisis at the age she was when the series started. Maybe Rory needed something crazy and drastic to her to make her grow up. Maybe the baby will finally be the push Rory needs to grow out of her immaturity and help steer her in the right direction.

This is *not her fault*, but it explains her perspective in the Revival. It's a common Millennial trait.


- So Rory worked hard in her education, achieving a Yale degree filled with extracurriculars, unpaid internships, networking events, etc. Understandably, she feels like she's entitled to a higher-ranked job as a result. 

- And, if you look at the success of Rory's peers (Paris, Doyle, Logan), this stress and feeling that she *should* get a great job right out of the gate is compounded. All her rich friends jumped into high ranking jobs, and she didn't. All her hometown friends made a family and social connections, and she didn't. I'd be a little frazzled, too.  

- She's also learning that a Bachelor's degree for Millennials is basically the equivalent of a high school education for other generations. It gets you the minimum, despite the older generations who say it gets you everything. A Master's degree is another year (or two) of work and money, for a low level job. In weighing her options, I agree that a Master's degree to teach high school English is not a good choice.


- As technology grows and the Millennials demand more instant gratification, Rory is realizing that journalism is slowly fading into nothing. All that's left are the Buzzfeed-like writing jobs that are just forgetful entertainment (""10 ways to blah blah blah!""). (For the record, a RL blogger wrote a post about being a journalist in the Obama campaign -- it was a lot of work for no pay, and only one of her articles was published near the back of the paper. Everyone sees Rory's Season 7 ending as her success, but the Revival shows that her career failed right out of the gate, despite one article).


- Because of all of this, Rory doesn't have a job that pays enough to live her life. The job offers she receives will never match the cost of her education, for years and years and years; the first generation for this to be true. And that's a shitty realization. (Although admittedly, I feel like ASP smudged Rory's history and pretended like her trust fund never happened, in order to make her storyline relatable to Millens right now).


I agree that Rory did *a lot* wrong in the Revival, but I also don't see her spoiled, either. Unpopular opinion, but I found her somewhat sympathetic: her situation was a weird mix of general fuck ups, trying to 'shoot for the stars' but failing, and a sociological look at how Millennials are falling apart. Their situation isn't necessary their fault, but rather due to how their personalities were groomed by the Boomers, and just shit luck at reaching adulthood during housing crises, job shortages, globalization, and a rapid societal shift. Sociologists are currently waiting to see *how* the 'middle class, school-based' Millennials deal with their situation, because it's their choices as 30yos that will decide how spoiled and immature they truly are, or if all that education and 'change the world' mentality will achieve something.

When you listen to experts, the answer to Millennials problems always boils down to: 

1. leave your single apartment and move closer to home (aka, you can't afford what you parents could afford, so give that up and live communally)
2. figure out your life priorities
3. reconnect with your peers and family instead of long distance interactions: put down the cell phone and delete social media (fighting the Millennials' high rates of anxiety/suicides/isolation)
4. take the ridiculously low-paying job for now
5. and have a side interest that can give you extra profit (to pay your rent). 

Which is basically the end of Rory's storyline: she leaves her apartment and moves home, she gets pregnant, which helps her decide that journalism (and Logan) aren't for her, throws away all her phones but the basic one, she reconnects with her town and all her old friends, she takes the *lowest* ranking job as a small town local newspaper, and she writes her book on the side. She's giving up the dreams her parents had for her and is embracing mental wellness.

But there is something that really unsettled me with the revival. 
In season 7, when Rory turned down Logan's proposal I was ecstatic. I LOVED Logan and I loved Rory and Logan. But as a young woman, I loved seeing a female protagonist who chose her career over love. It was very rare to see that on television and honestly, it kind of inspired me. 

You would think that this decision would be good for her, she would build herself a successful career and then AFTER that maybe she would find herself someone who was suitable for her at that point in her life. 

Then the revival comes. We find out that she is struggling in her career and has not made big like some of her classmates (Logan, Paris). And to make it worse, she is in a relationship with an absolute dud while being Logan's mistress at the same time. And she becomes pregnant with Logan's child and hints at making the decision to raise the child alone. 

I know ASH did not write the seventh season but the revival seems  to make it seem like her big decision in season 7 was done in vain. She said no to focus on her career -- she ended up not attaining her career goals and she ended up still being pregnant with his child who will be raised alone. 
It just makes it seem to me that she would have been better off marrying him. And that unsettles me. Thoughts?

But the more I think about it, I just can't get over how so much of it comes across almost as a first draft? There were so many plot lines that were just never fully developed, jokes that made no sense at all or just fell totally flat, characters that showed no growth, or story devices that seems to come out of nowhere and not really fit. A rough list of what I'm thinking of:

* Why did Luke and Lorelai not get married after 9 years of being together? I know Lorelai says ""I just don't do thing like my mother!"" in therapy, but is that really it? Had they never discussed it before? I wish they'd gone it into that more
* The letter!!!!!
* Rory editing the Stars Hollow Gazette. She starts there and then... what? Just leaves, I guess?
* The Paul thing. Rory forgetting about a person she's been seeing for two years is just not believable or funny. I think if they'd had a proper writer's room this could have been tightened up a bit to be a real joke but as it is, idk
* The gay pride parade comes up once, never mentioned again
* The musical as well. Does it ever have an opening night? 
* The child servants at the pool. Who were they? Why? How?

I hate to be so negative, but the more I think about it the more AYTIL feels like some ideas/jokes were jotted down on paper and they put in some filler dialogue and then that version somehow got mixed up with the real show? I can't believe they had to have, what, 5-10 minutes of the Stars Hollow musical, the fat shaming at the pool, the town meeting about a gay pride parade which never actually happens, but then ran out of budget for Luke and Lorelai's wedding!

As someone who just recently rewatched the entire series, it's frustrating that more than 90% of posts on this subreddit are basing their complaints on things that didn't actually happen or things that did happen and they chose to ignore.

Let's start with plot arcs. In most long-running TV shows, there are two or more concurrent arcs. One is the seasonal arc, where (if it were an action show) a new villain is introduced and defeated within a season (sometimes more). Now obviously there are no villains in GG but you get the idea.

Second, there is the series arc. This arc is a much slower burn and often is not fully realized until the final season, where the seasonal arc and series arc combine. While not every show follows this formula, it's important to note that **Gilmore Girls does use both seasonal and series arcs**.

Now, when you start from the beginning and watch through without any information ahead of time, you will only really notice the seasonal arcs. Which isn't a slight against anyone, it's nearly impossible to deduce the series arc without getting to the end.

Gilmore Girls is given to us as a light dramedy about a mother and daughter. But it's more than that. We all know it's more than that because we're all here obsessing about it. It reveals over time that it can actually be quite meaningful and that the title does not refer solely to the mother and daughter duo, but to Emily as well.

Now that we've established that **Gilmore Girls is not what it seems to be on the surface**, I can touch on the series arc I've been avoiding.

One of the most important rules for writing fiction is that a character must not be the same as they were at the start. A character has to be able to change over time, *even if that change is negative*.

When we first meet Rory (the first season), she is on top of the world. She is smart, funny, driven, and innocent. The world is at her fingertips. As a character, she has nowhere to go but down.

And that's exactly what happens. That's the *point*.

It's not a story about a teen mother who strikes out on her own away from her parents suffocating lifestyle and has a kid that gets a perfect life.

It's a story about a teen mother who strikes out on her own away from her parents suffocating lifestyle and overcompensates for it.

It's a sad story about a young woman's fall from grace, covered up with comedy, wit, and positive outlooks.

Rory starts at the top and gets worse every season until eventually she ends up in the exact same place her mother did. That does not counteract her character growth, *that is her character growth*.

Before the revival came out, I staunchly defended season 7. I didn't think it was that bad, but everyone hated it because ASP didn't write it.

Looking back now, it's clear that season 7 wasn't true Gilmore Girls, which is what everyone was trying to tell me before the revival.

See, season 7 doesn't ""fit"". It's not consistent with the rest of the series. It's happy and perfect, wrapped up in a nice little bow. Every character takes a 180 from where they were in season 6.

And yet, it's the last impression we're given before we get to the revival. All anyone remembers is the happy ending. They don't remember that the characters never earned that ending, and it was instead given to us by people who weren't concerned with telling the story of the Gilmore Girls, but instead making the executives happy.

In conclusion, the revival is far more consistent with the OS than anyone is giving it credit for. It's unfortunate we had to wait nearly ten years to get it, but this is what it was always going to be.

Ignoring the point of the OS and getting mad that the revival wasn't happy-go-lucky fun time is frustrating to say the least. If you want a nice happy ending where everyone gets exactly what they want, there's plenty of fan fiction that I'm sure will suit you.

Guys, for real: Get over it. That's ok if Rory doesn't end up with Jess, or Logan. They are not the most important thing here, the show isn't about them. Full circle isn't about them.

So I'm rewatching the OS after watching the Revival, starting with season one. I've seen each episode at least ten times but I'm not sure I've ever watched the whole show from S1E1 to the end. ANYWAY 

I've had to stop myself from posting on this sub during just about every episode I've watched, but I've just started season 2 and I can't deal with it. Max proposing to Lorelai is RIDICULOUS. 

-they had been ""back together"" for at most ONE MONTH when he proposed. Not to mention the first time they dated they were together for how long...? A few months? 
-have they ever spent the night together? 
-dean's speech to max. He's telling max the most basic things that he doesn't even know because he doesn't know Lorelai at all
-within the time period they were broken up, max seriously dated someone else? Can he calm down?
-they never talked about Max's role in Rory's life
-the way max acts when he meets Luke for the first time is so immature and embarrassing 
-he proposed because they were fighting. As if them getting married would be any less scandalous than them dating...
-when Lorelai tells Luke that max proposed and he asks where are you going to live, are you going to have more kids, etc and she doesn't know ANYTHING because they never talk about anything 

I just. Can't. I have so many feels when rewatching the OS... don't even get me started on how immature Lorelai is and how much Rory sucks. Just watching the episode where Rory goes to the chilton party and kisses Tristan made me roll my eyes. Rory is ""so amazing"" and such a good person but she's at a party with easily 200 people and can't start a conversation with one stranger?? She reads a freakin book in the corner instead? Ugh. And when she runs away to her grandparents... wow she is so great. She never even called Lorelai! She's 16 and acts 12.

First, she had no consistent father figure in her life. 

Second, her mother was, growing up, the epitome of how to fail at romantic relationships:

* Rory watched her mother abstain romantically for 16 years, then get involved in a string of star-crossed relationships. 

* Max was a trainwreck whom her mother abandoned hours(?) before their wedding day, effectively destroying the step-relationship to which both Max and Rory had been looking forward, and which would have done Rory a world of good.

* Jason's and Lorelai's relationship was mired in deception and then dissolved because of what may or may not have been a serious betrayal to the family.  Another form of betrayal/abandonment, however small.

* Lorelai and Chris have this will-they-or-won't-they thing forever, stringing Rory along in the process for years. Their marriage is a sham and dissolves within seconds. 

* Luke and Lorelai seem oddly fitting for each other, but have *absurd* communication and trust issues all around.


Then there's Rory herself. Her first truly passionate love abandons her, without a word of good-bye no less, and much more directly than the other men in her life. 

In the OS, she seems to be a firm disbeliever in cheating. She is horrified when Paris cheats on Jamie (not just because Asher is 42 years Paris's senior, I'm sure); is harshly critical of Lorelai sleeping with Christopher so soon after her break from Luke in S5or6, and is heartbroken when Logan jumps into bed with multiple bridesmaids even though they were on a break. 

With no resolution with her patterns of abandonment and issues of trust and stability in her life, it is unfortunate but also makes a sad sense that she becomes what she has been so disapproving of in the past. 

Romantically, she is like a lost girl, unsure of how to treat people properly. Also of note, besides Lane and Paris, she has sustained no close friendships either, nor a successful romantic relationship. I hope she can turn it around in this fictional universe. I really do.",12,25,False,self,,,,,

Here are my thoughts...

Good (maybe spoilers)

- It's still Gilmore Girls. For better or worse, an average GG episode is more entertaining than most shows. 

- Improved lighting over S6 and S7. The darker atmosphere made it feel more realistic. 

- Luke and Lorelai finally closed the deal. It would be nice in the future if their scenes were more lighthearted and comedic, and the serious parts focus on Rory. But I'm just glad it happened. 

- As others mentioned, Emily had a nice arc and ended up in a job that I would have never guessed before watching. 

Neutral

- Rory's storyline. It doesn't bother me too much she's not an angel. I think it actually makes her more interesting of a character. But, I was more interested in the Luke/Lorelai story than anything.  

Bad

- Overuse of old sets that were already established as something else. Everyone knew that was the Dragonfly Inn in the Fall scenes with Rory and Logan, not...wherever they went (New Hampshire?)

- Other inconsistencies. Stars Hollow doesn't have an approved late night bar? Didn't Christopher and Jackson have a drink at one in Season 7? Didn't Christopher come out of a bar late at night, and then proceed to brawl with Luke a few seconds later?

- Seeing all the past stars was nice, but I always wondered whether they were just being squeezed in. It felt like...""Hey remember this character? Look what he's doing now."" Ex. Dean. They weren't essential to the story.

I did enjoy seeing April for a few minutes though. Wish she had a larger role.

2) something about always leaving each season open-ended so that more episodes are demanded
3) her recent full-circle quotes about how Rory = Lorelai and Logan = Chris and Jess = Luke

I feel like the full circle quote was said to give hope (plus discussion) to both teams in case there were no more episodes- Team Jess can imagine their happy ending, and Team Logan can be excited that Rory/Logan will remain forever linked.

However, if more episodes were made, would ASP actually follow through on just circling the story? Wouldn't that be boring? Maybe she really does want Rory to end up alone, with someone else, for Jess to meet a better match, and/or for Logan to Voila! be different from Christopher in the end (oops, how'd that happen!?)

I can't imagine a writer ACTUALLY giving the true plot away. Wouldn't that sorta kill all suspense and intrigue?

My problem is that ASP is trying to tell me how it is when it's not reflected in the actual show. You wanted to force Chris to suddenly have a law degree and work for his father's company? Sure, but don't tell me about full circle when we both know you ignored your own previous writing just to sorta kinda maybe draw a parallel. You gave Lane just a few minutes of screen time? Fine(well no, not fine) but don't come out and say you love Lane. You made over 50% of the revival about Rory's love life? Excellent, but don't you tell me I'm insane and focusing on Rory's love life for no damn reason. The examples can continue. 

Basically, I'd say my problem is not with the show, flawed as it may be; I find that I have some issues with the creator actually.

So when the revival came out, I hadn't watched GG much in 3 years. I was very wary of the whole thing and had low expectations, but from that position it wasn't too hard to be satisfied. I knew it was flawed and overly focussed on cameos etc, but overall it didn't bother me too much. If I'm honest, I thought of GG as a ""guilty pleasure"" at that point anyway, so I didn't find it weird for there to be silly moments or for it to be lacking.

I felt obsessed with GG again, so I started a rewatch of the OS (my third time watching the whole way through). I utterly *loved* it and I binge-watched all 7 seasons over the last month. This time it didn't feel ""guilty"" at all - it's a genuinely great show (give or take some bad stuff towards the end). Naturally I went straight into rewatching the revival once S7 had ended, feeling like ""Yes, I'm so glad I have more this time around!""

...But it felt *so much worse*. Being able to compare it right next to the OS made the flaws inexcusable and I couldn't believe how *different* it felt. The dialogue is forced, the style is wrong, the connections aren't there....Even little things, like seeing the girls on iPhones, made me uncomfortable: Gilmore Girls belongs to a different time! It's just not the show we love. Some points:

* The style of humour feels really off: suddenly it's grand and absurd, more like a Bill Lawrence comedy or something (but not funny). The OS was quirky and occasionally daft but still always felt grounded; they completely fail to capture that balance again in AYITL. Instead I constantly felt awkward, almost embarrassed.

* The pace is BIZARRE - very little seems to happen and yet it also feels like it's brushing over loads of stuff. When I heard about the 4 x 90mins structure, I assumed that each one would have distinct arc. They don't actually do *anything* with this idea. All it does is make the episodes drag and feel stuffed with filler. There are multiple episodes in the OS that do more in 40 minutes than AYITL did with 90. The show was all about pace and driven by dialogue, yet here we get several fancy sequences that take up time and deliver nothing. It's honestly hard to believe it's the same writers.

* The parade of characters from the OS who pop up for a ""Hey, remember me?!"" appearance is so cheap and annoying.

* Way too much takes place outside Stars Hollow. This fundamentally changes the feel of the show.

* One of my very favourite characters in the OS is Luke, and the L&amp;L relationship is the most compelling aspect of the show to me. So I *really* hate to see what they did to Luke here. Scott Patterson does his best but suddenly Luke becomes this brainless, pointless guy - with virtually every line he is confused and sounds like an idiot. Having him dress the same way, with the backwards cap, seems cringey when he's nearly 60 (and looks it) - especially as Lorelai has become more and more glamorous (something else I don't like). Anyone who watched AYITL without seeing the OS would think ""Huh? Why are these two together? What's the big deal about them as a couple?"" Because there's nothing sweet, charming, or attractive about Luke this time; no evidence of his devotion or their unique friendship. On the contrary, he seems especially grumpy and L&amp;L can barely connect (the bedroom scene is the only sweet one). The speech in the kitchen is his big moment but even that fell flat this time, because it doesn't feel like the Luke I love and it doesn't feel *earned*. The drama between them is contrived and undeveloped, and we've seen no reason why they are a good couple who should be together. And yet the whole miniseries leads up to their wedding..? This was meant to be the big payoff, but it *isn't* at this point. 

* Which brings me to (related point, but I'll keep it separate) - the idea that L&amp;L didn't marry seems even more ridiculous after rewatching the OS. I'd forgotten how plainly Lorelai wants to be married! It's obvious several times throughout the show that it's what she wants: from accepting Max's proposal, to telling Emily she'd like to marry someday, to playing around with a wedding dress, to proposing herself, to being devastated when the Luke wedding is postponed, to **literally breaking up with Luke because he won't marry her**, to rushing to marry Chris because she so badly wants a marriage to work....Sheesh. And then all we get in AYITL is ""I don't do things like my mother"". Terrible. It's such, such lazy writing that unfortunately ruins the illusion fans had of L&amp;L's relationship.

* The Rory stuff has been complained about to death, but I only felt bothered by it on this rewatch. I previously never felt invested in her character, would even fast forward through her scenes, so I didn't really care what happened to her when I first watched AYITL. But I came to like her a bit more as I rewatched the OS, so I understand the frustration now. They really do make her awful! It's bizarre. 

* I didn't even like Lorelai much this time and she's one of my very favourite characters ever. The spark just isn't there. Ultimately, I think seeing everyone older was a bit of a bummer....and I know that sounds horrible and shallow in some ways, but it was kind of better leaving everyone at a fresher, happier place...Know what I mean? Or do I just sound awful saying that?

* In comparison to the previous closure we had - I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the S7 finale, it's actually very sweet and appropriate. I genuinely think it would have been better to leave things there. We were able to imagine Rory becoming the independent woman Lorelai always wanted, Lorelai and Emily finally developing a good relationship, L&amp;L being happily united and resolving their issues.....I prefer all of those options to what we were given in the revival, which as well as under-delivering on characters changed the *feel* of the show in a way I'm really not comfortable with. 

I could keep going, but I won't. Long story short: I felt sad watching AYITL this time. I understand the passionate disappointment from fans now because I reconnected with the original series and was reminded how great it can be. I love Gilmore Girls more than ever right now, and I'm so grateful to the cast and crew, but this revival shouldn't have happened. Previously I was able to say ""Oh I don't take AYITL very seriously anyway, so whatever"", but it doesn't seem that simple anymore....They took the characters and world I love and turned it into something different. I'm a bit scared now that they're going to do another season, because I do not trust them. If I felt that they could do it again and capture the OS, sure, but it feels very unlikely....Sigh. The solution is refusing to accept AYITL as canon; the show really ended 9 years ago.",24,42,False,self,,,,,

And then I realized that maybe, that was the point. The more her family money entered her life, the worse she got. The more times money and connections bailed her out, the less she had to fight and try and make effort for herself. If she and Lorelei had stayed away, and she had stayed at public school, she probably would have ended up a more successful person, because of it. And she still would have had a shot at the Ivy League, as a smart but economically disadvantaged student - recruiters seek them out. But it would have been on her own merit, and she would have worked harder, been less complacent.

She gets jealous when Luke has other women in his life.

She's the Gilmore's only daughter. It's hard enough to imagine Lorelai sitting on millions of dollars and a vast amount of property while still living in Stars Hollow. But it was always strange to me that Lorelai knew she would inherit that money, even as a teen, and she always had that fallback option. Richard and Emily have always made it clear that Lorelai could have come home at any time, and that she had effectively kept their grandchild from them. The money was never off the table.

Would the show have been more interesting if Lorelai had had a sibling? A 'perfect' sibling who can do no wrong, and so maybe the Gilmore's removed Lorelai from the inheritance when she ran away from home?

In many ways, she's a Mary Sue who is beautiful, constantly lauded and has guys throwing them at her feet. I always pictured myself at a prep school like Chilton and having the opportunity to do stuff like summer leadership internships in Washington. I wasn't really interested in any of her boyfriends, but I especially hated Jess. IRL, there was no way the young me could identify with a character like that, and I couldn't even imagine myself even being friends with a guy who was rude to all my family and friends. 

Now as a professional who has worked with many troubled young people from broken homes, I'm starting to see Jess in a different light. Namely, I'm somewhat impressed that all the trouble he got in consisted of skipping school to work, being sullen, drinking beer and ruining Rory's prom. The amount of attitude, swearing and sometimes outright aggression I've encountered make Jess seem like an angel. Many of the young people are already hardcore drug addicts and felons. They treat people who are genuinely trying to help them like dirt, and there are days where I just can't take the sneering and the wisecracks anymore. Through it all though, I can tell that the vulnerability and fear that drove them into these actions. When I rewatch Gilmore Girls again, I'm somewhat ashamed at my lack of empathy towards a troubled young man who came from a terrible home with a flakey mother and no father figure. I know he's a fictional character, but he reminds me of a lot of the kids I've worked with. I'm glad that he's able to make something of his life and I wish we got to see a bit more of his journey. I just hate that everybody right away dismissed him as ""trouble"", and I wonder how much the town's attitude towards him actually set him back. Season 6 and revival Jess is certainly no saint, but I find his journey inspiring, and I've started to experiment using him to connect to some of the kids I'm working with (to get them to read more basically). 

Vs Rory. I think enough has been said about her entitlement. Intentional or not, I find the show's treatment of her, Logan and Jess's ""acting out"" behavior to be a telling example of injustice and class privilege. Just like Jess, she was not yet equipped to deal with setbacks in a healthy way. In fact, she dealt with Mitchum's criticisms by committing a crime, dropping out of school and being rude to her mother. Her grandparents took care of the legal bills. She could live at her grandparents' mansion, work for the DAR and continue to party with her rich boyfriend. In fact, Logan, who's from an even more privileged background, did not seem to get in trouble for what he did at all. Can you imagine if somebody like Jess did what they did? First of all, I don't think he'd have anyone sitting him down and reassuring him that everything would be alright. I think Luke would try his best, but ultimately would be unable to afford a good lawyer. (Also, I think Luke would want him to face the consequences of his actions because he's a better parent than Lorelai, but that's beside the point.)

I know Jess has lots of fans, but as a person working with troubled youths, I find the lack of empathy towards young Jess and the tolerance for the much worse behavior from Logan and Rory to be quite disheartening. ",9,25,False,self,,,,,

He was beyond just Rory's love interest to me. He was such a complicated character and I related to him more than her a lot of the time. 

I can see the obvious ""bad boy"" correlation w him but I think he was one of the most genuinely good people on the show. He was lost and angry as a kid but he wasn't as selfish and spineless as Logan, and frankly Dean was the typical small town nice boy that in no way challenged Rory. Jess was the only one who had a backbone and who was always about Rory. As soon as Rory is in the picture he is focused on her. Logan and her seem more like best friends and there is clearly a love for each other. But they didn't change each other or make the other better. 

But, one theory I would like to discuss is Rory's feelings for Jess and their relationships impact on the other. 

I feel like both of their lives completely change after their relationship. Which kind of proves that they're soul mates in my opinion. Jess grows into himself and finds himself and he still loves Rory. After he leaves her Rory completely goes downhill and clearly continues even 10 years later. Not just because of Jess but it seems like he is a catalyst.

I think she runs into deans arms at the end of season 4 bc she was so afraid of the uncertainty Jess brought to her life. She was never IN love with dean but she was in love with Jess. Love like that is scary and people run away from it. 

I think that his small arc in season 6 was such a rip off and a bad way to end his story! Jess is a good influence on her CLEARLY.

Logan was ""dangerous"" in a stupid way. I think Rory flocks to him bc he brings her comfort. With Logan, the comfort of money is there, the comfort of connections, he won't challenge her in a deep way. He enables her to do the least and someone wo genuinely loves you and is in love with you will never let you be the side chick. 

I don't get why they even brought Jess around for Rory to use him in season 6. It felt like a waste and cheapening their connection. She was still so lost. 

I wonder why Rory seems to be completely CLUELESS that Jess still cares about her. And why she seemingly showcases no romantic feelings for him. But I feel like their connection was clearly more than romance. I wish Jess had more screen time. I really hope they do more revivals and kind of bring all of Rory's potential back out. She had character in the first few seasons and now she remained a spoiled 22 year old child at 32. 

I just think the two characters make the other grow. Jess is the only character who could set her straight.

But even ignoring the highly impulsive and improbable elopement of Lorelai and Christopher, the entire concept of ""French Twist"" drives me up the goddamn wall for one fucking reason-

4am is not the middle of the night.

It may be in the fictional world of Stars Hollow, where people can wake up at the boo-hoo-early hour of 7am (the struggle!), leisurely stroll to the local diner for coffee and pancakes, and still make the half hour bus to school before the bell rings, or to go relieve the night manager of the inn before his resentment towards his never-there coworkers makes him explode with rage. But we're talking about Paris.

Lorelai and Christopher wake up jet lagged at 4 in the morning, spend some time trying to fall back asleep, wander around at least part of the city looking for a place to eat (including a bakery that seems mostly prepared to open, given that the baguettes are rolling out for delivery and the shelf life of a good, French baguette is about .5 seconds after it comes out of the oven), go back to their hotel for a snog (he must be quick!), and then head out to the restaurant that Christopher paid to have open at 5am.

You're telling me that they did all of that in under an hour? That they managed to mobilize an entire restaurant staff at an hour when most of them would still be sleeping off the night shift? Nothing in that kitchen would be prepped for service, it could genuinely take hours before a decent meal was ready to be served, and in the meantime, all of those cafes and bakeries that Paris is famed for would have their doors open and fresh baked goods ready to go.

I know. This is not the thing to get upset over in this episode. There is no reason why this particular error should make me so enraged.

The way he just took a jet back from England anytime he wanted aka they needed him in a scene. The way Christopher had gobs of money to make absolutely anything happen. It felt like the way a pre-teen dreamed of her future or just extremely lazy writing. The conflicts no longer felt real and all of a sudden money could solve almost any issue. And the worst part was, Rory and Lorelai were eating it all up. I remember Logan whisking Rory off to New York (S6E4 I think) for the weekend by jet and she was all, ""Oh LoOogan, wow! New York!"" and was all impressed and googly eyed about it. They used to value education, friendship, hard work, and whimsy. At the end, suddenly flashing money around seemed to impress them.

Gilmore Girls: Beginnings will feature encore presentations of the hit show's first season.
It will remind longtime fans of all the reasons they love Gilmore Girls and will answer questions newer fans may have, such as: When did Lorelai and Rory get to Stars Hollow? Why do they go to dinner at Emily and Richard Gilmore's every week? How did Rory and Dean's relationship start? And how does Luke really feel about Lorelai's coffee habit? Gilmore Girls: Beginnings is an opportunity to visit Stars Hollow a second time each week, or to get to know it for the first time. Episodes will run in the order they were first aired.
A Warner Bros. Television production with executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino (Roseanne), Gavin Polone (Curb Your Enthusiasm, Panic Room) and Daniel Palladino.

But I want to focus on some of our favorite things. I loved Emily's growth. I thought she had a beautiful story line and truly connected with the audience (or at least me and I'm 26). I also really appreciated the dirty dancing references, like the white keds and the Jerry Orbach love. 

I also liked seeing that Lane and Zach hadn't given up. Some people would argue that they gave into the man but to me they seemed happy. They were playing music, raising their sons, and still in love. 

Things changed. We can argue back and forth that there were so many changes and we didn't like this or that but I liked that there was change. So much time had gone by that Sookie and Michel couldn't be in the same place as they were in before. Who wants to do the same job with no new challenge for that long. Even Lorelai wanted to expand the inn by the end. Things had progressed and it was obvious to me that times had gone by other than just the fact that the characters were older.

Now I get that, for Rory, hearing someone who is so high-up in the world of journalism tell you that ""you don't have what it takes"" would be crushing, especially after she experienced success in journalism at Yale. Instead of throwing her fit and dropping out of Yale she should have maybe thought about what he said. I'm not saying that she should have dropped it instantly based on what he said, but maybe just question if it is really what she wants to do. She was majoring in english so she could obviously still be a writer (as she ultimately does in AYITL).

Now I'm not saying her journalism career was a complete waste; she did have some success like her New Yorker piece and obviously she could have still struggled as a writer, but taking Mitchum's advice would have saved her the years of passionless journalism jobs here or there.

Sure, I get that characters change and that they evolve/ devolve and that she wasn't perfect in the OS either, etc. This isn't about that. This is about the specific traits of Rory's character that seem to be totally gone in the revival. The main one is: LISTS. Yeah, lists.

Rory in the OS looooooves making lists. She does it for nearly everything. Pro/cons lists, lists for university clubs/extra curricular activities, lists for prospect jobs, etc. Right off the bat they show us Rory making a list as a way to introduce us to her character. I always felt like lists to Rory were more quintessential than coffee or junk food. That was such a big insight into her personality (often showed in stark contrast to Lorelai who rarely planned anything and just went for things based on her gut feeling). 

Then we have the revival and nothing. No lists. Consequently, Rory is shown to be an entitled person, and... a lazy person; going more on a gut feeling like Lorelai rather than how Rory would have in the OS. In the OS she is driven and hard working. Even in her bad moments, like in season 6 when she quits college and she does the DAR events and works really hard at them. Compare that with the revival when she doesn't even prepare for her interviews.

Even if you wanted to have her character devolve, you could still keep true to her personality and show her making pro/cons list for returning to Stars Hallow, or pro/cons to breaking up with Paul, pro/con for being with Logan, whatever. Even use that thinking pattern to explain her procrastination and stagnation in professional life.

So, I get that characters change... but that kind of anal, obsessive personality trait where a person loves making lists doesn't just change. That kind of thinking pattern doesn't just stop or change.

So, that's what I missed in the revival in regards to Rory. Lists.",42,76,False,self,,,,,

You have transformed his character and his story arc is just perfect. I love that you took all of his negatives and turned them around for him. This so rarely happens in real life and to see it on screen is a little glimmer of hope. Especially seeing how 2016 has pretty much been abysmal as far as years go. That was my silver lining.

Now for the love of god when you make more episodes (because I will lead a rebellion if there are no more episodes in the pipeline and no one wants that) please JUST MAKE HIM FIX RORY. PLEASE. They are soulmates and she needs him. So much. Just like he needs her. He needs her believing in him because no one else did. Her character fascinates me on so many levels and Jess is the right guy to help her. 

As for the pregnancy and Logan - I get the whole Lion King, Circle of Life, history repeating theme. But please. I have GOT to see how she grows after whichever path she decides to go down with the pregnancy. Please. And Logan is so awful at this point I can't stomach him. Attention must be paid to how crazy wild his arc has been as a character. Season Seven has been largely ignored but it's important that more information is given.

Thank you for showing us what the real Emily Gilmore is like. It was just fabulous.

Please explain to me. As far as I know:

-she is 32 year old

-she has an education

-she is employable if need be. The only reason she was jobless was because she was too proud to take jobs she thought were beneath her. If pushed comes to shove, of course she'd get a job

-she can rent an apartment, she was looking for one towards the end anyways, wasn't she

-she has a good support system until she does get on her feet

-the dad is(possibly) engaged. It's horrible, but tragic? Not really

-she will most likely have to be a single mother. Is that a tragedy? If so, how? Plenty single parents out there, would you consider their kid's existence a tragedy just because it's not the ""standard"" two parent household

So, why is it horrible and why do you assume it would ruin Lorelai's wedding day to find out she'll be a grandmother?

Edit: Lorelai and Luke had already gotten married, Rory waited until after the wedding to tell them. They eloped. The town wedding was going to be just a party/formality at that point.",52,38,False,self,,,,,

The hours were long and hard. Alexis just had a child and might want another soon. She most likely won't want to work the OS hours. So that leaves a 4 movie Netflix version, if it happens. I would be happy with the Netflix version. I am not sure if anyone has ever discussed a full regular season. Any other items that might affect the decision?
