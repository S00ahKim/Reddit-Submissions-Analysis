About a week goes by (feel free to correct me on the time) and Rory has not spoken to him at all, but doesn't seem to feel as though they are anything less than committed.
Logan on the other hand tells Honor they broke up, though he mentions he's not sure what he thought in later discussions with Rory, and proceeds to hook up with at least one girl that weekend, and at least a few others over the next month or so.

I personally think both of them should have confirmed whether or not they were together, but I honestly don't feel like it's a big deal that he slept with girls while he thought he wasn't with Rory.

Do you think that Logan was totally in the wrong from the moment they got into the fight? Or do you think that Logan had good reason to think they were over? Or somewhere in between?

I was thinking through the revival.. I think Richard's death and Emily's reaction will somehow lead to events of Rory and Lorelai wanting a husband and wanting to feel settled. Rory will be reunited with Logan through a family event or Yale event related to Richard. Then Jess will come in and help Rory along in the next step of her career path and be the ""team of mules"" that finally gets Luke down the aisle. Luke and Lorelai's wedding. I think (HOPE) Milo's weird quote about looking across the aisle at Logan as an adult was that he would be on Luke's side and Logan would be on Lorelai's with Rory.

So I was picturing this whole wedding and realized Richard wouldn't be a part of it. He died without a wedding for either of his daughters. Without knowing they'd found their partners like Emily had with him.

Now, many people over the years (myself included) have noticed how similar he looks to Jess - he even sounds a bit like him. My question is: do you think this was deliberate? Or purely coincidental.

I think it must have been deliberate. The entire season is about Rory finding college a struggle and not having the golden girl, easy Stars Hollow life anymore. This is contrasted a lot with her remembering how Jess wasn't reliable and Dean was always there for her. It's also shown multiple times, with Dean being there when she has her breakdown and Jess telling Rory he loves her then running away again. The girls later drunkenly call Dean and the very end of the episode she and Dean have a nice phone call. The guy (Sean) she likes turns out to be a dud. 

I think it also might show how she's still conflicted about Jess. Much of Season 4 deals with the fallout from their relationship and Rory's emotional state after it. Mainly, Rory going back to the stable Dean and looking at their relationship through rose-tinted glasses  (conveniently forgetting how bored she was when she was in that relationship) because it's emotionally safe and she won't get hurt like she did with Jess. Yet Rory is still attracted to this guy who looks like Jess and has a bit of an edge about him. Is it showing she hasn't let go as much as she thought? Perhaps it's also purging - when the guy turns out to be romance material, it's representing her moving away from Jess and getting over him. 

So do you guys think this was deliberate in playing into the whole theme of Rory's arc for the season? Or am I just over analysing? ",9,11,False,self,,,,,

When we think about why we hate or love a character, and base them on their actions in the series, do you take into account that the writer has made a point of writing them that way? This is sort of confusing to try and explain. 

For example, a common argument is whether ""Character X"" should have done this, instead of that. Now, the characters ARE who they are based on the right and seemingly wrong decisions they make on the show. They are the makeup of all the plotlines they are put through. 

I guess my little pondering is a little meta, in that I am questioning **why we enjoy debating fictional characters choices, they were MADE to do.** Do you get what I mean?

I don't hide my hate for Dean, but I also acknowledge he had to be who he had to be to get Rory to a certain place. I hate a character based on what they have done, and how they have ended up. On my own personal bias.  I find I don't get into the ""They should have done x and y instead of z"" debates, as I feel they are redundant? Anyone else? I am NOT bagging out that line of conversation topic! I enjoy reading them, but I think I get too in my head about it all being purposefully *written* that way, so I can't get into it as much? Am I making sense?

A more specific example is debating whether Rory should have accepted Logan's proposal or not. She didn't accept. And even though I think it was a shitty decision, I think that was a failure on the writer's part, not Rory as a character. (i've said it before, I think it was a cop out ending, because they didn't want to END the story and have a canon set in stone forever..). It then leads to ""She could have still said yes, and had a career!"" or ""Her career was going nowhere!"" or ""Good for her, she is too young!"".. But all *I* can think, is well.. she said no. That's it. We cannot be sure about anything a character does off-screen or internally think, even based on what we think we *know* about a character. For that specific situation when I read why/why not arguments, I feel people get so passionate about what THEY think is right, but again a characters trajectory will never to influenced by what we believe them to be, only what the writers want to take them. So really we are arguing about each persons own internal universe of Gilmore, not the one we see on screen... **I reiterate that I am NOT dissing, or hating on these lines of conversation, merely just voicing why, I, myself cannot get into them, without getting all meta**

I seem to sway between thinking of it in the sense of enjoying the show and loving the characters as *real* people or as a story where things happened and there's no two ways about it.... (seriously guys am I making an ounce of sense?? **I will probably delete this in shame for not being able to convey my thoughts properly, just a heads up lol**)

Feel free to ask me questions to clarify what I mean!

Here are some reasons why I liked the episode so much:

* Lorelai realises Chris is letting her, that it was what she was missing all along with Luke - I think she needed that trust again after Luke had been keeping April a secret from her for ages. It made me truly happy for Lorelai that she finally got that.

* The scene when Logan calls Rory to drop her books and meet her on the roof to surprise her was so cute! 

* Next seen Rory wants to kiss Logan one more bye before he goes to his meeting to buy a company and he tricks her as if he was going to kiss her and then just smiles omg his face in that scene *swoon* soooo adorable! I wish someone could make a gif of that!

* Rory telling Logan that she misses him in her typical Rory-esque way and the way he responds with only five words, shows that they both truly get each other. He knows she needed to vent, but understood what she was saying and she knew he understood her but only needed a few words as a confirmation in return. I just feel they really work great as a couple!

* At Friday Night Dinner when everyone is gathering around Lorelai's phone to look at Emily's mug shots - HILARIOUS! Not even Richard could pass out on it!

* Last scene in the car, when Rory, Lorelai and Chris are switching music channels: It's just one of those rare family moments you get from all of them together. I love the way every one is so content and happy in that moment.


So what did you guys think about this Episode? Also what about the rest of the season 7? I must admit I totally forgot that there were really good moments as well in this season (There was a post about Logan visiting Stars Hollow before, also a good episode) Love to read all of your opinions! :)",14,18,False,self,,,,,

I am sure I not the first to arrive at this conclusion but GG can almost serve as a meditation piece on change and growing up, especially if you are lucky enough to have watched it during your formative years and then again after you've gained some life experience. *As my point of view changes, the focal point of the show shifts to another character I was previously enjoying but not identifying with and a lot of the motivations and exchanges on the show seem more true to life.*

I first watched glimpses of this when it was on tv during my mid-teens. I liked it well enough but I was never big on tv and had no other means of watching it so, while I was familiar with the core characters and the theme of the show, I did not follow it closely and so, I did not get it. My main watch though all seasons happened when I was in my first or second year of college. I watched all of it. I loved it, even though I was not heavily invested in Lorelai's stolylines, just Rory's (and Emily/Richard were just there to be sweet and annoying). This is because Lorelai was the mother figure and I could simply not identify with her perspective and the issues she had to deal with.

I am now 26 years old and nearing the end of my second full GG rewatch A lot has changed since first experiencing the show at 18. I am not a mother but Lorelai now seems more like a friend than a mother figure and her issues are closer to mine. I am not sure if my opinion this time around is more valid than before but it has been a delight to discover the parallels between my subsequent choices and their outcome and the character development on GG.
Starting with the basics:

** Lorelai**

I used to enjoy Lorelai but I did not get her. She is everything I was not but did not know it yet: she has a strong sense of self, she allows herself to be flawed, she is brave both in her decisions and in putting herself out there, she is determined and childish at the same time. She does not care if she is 'too much' as long as she gets to say that stupid funny line in her head because she is confident someone but not everyone will appreciate it and she will be liked or, at least, tolerated regardless.

And she really, really needs to be away from her parents in order to flourish. They express love differently than she does, almost less humanely. Giving opportunities to a child is important but is not the bond she craves. Money does come with expectations. Parents do not always meet you halfway. It is exhausting to deal with parents who place their (rather shallow) expectations of you before they place you: what you enjoy, what you hate, what makes you laugh, what makes you tick. It is, in fact, much more difficult to be someone you like near parents like Richard and Emily. You cower and almost instinctively get ""shorter"", revert to old little you, trapped and unhappy and feeling guilty that you cannot fix the situation without compromising yourself because you know that they will hardly change. You know that you cannot be happy together because you have grown in very different directions but deep inside, it hurts you that you can do nothing about it.

Unlike naive, lucky Rory, however, you are aware of the effort it took to remove the Richard and Emily-ness from your life and your mind and the huge cost of returning to it; therefore, any remaining regret at your superficial relationship with them does not sway you and, ultimately, does not make you unhappy. As long as you keep a fair (but not total) distance.

** Rory**

Rory used to be my alter ego, down to the slight social awkwardness and the fact that I could still be popular with a tiny bit of effort because of conventional attractiveness. I thought Rory was cool. I was glad I could see myself her. She seemed less scary than Lorelai. She was not wild and did not disregard social convention. She was soft and mostly a good girl and respectful. Her choices made sense. Now, her choices make sense for who she is and the point she is at in her life.

I strongly feel that she is on a track to becoming Emily rather than Lorelai. As time goes on, Rory becomes a difficult person to get along with. Not in the same way as Lorelai, who is fast and elusive but fiercely loyal. Rory is a bit slippery, for lack of a better word: she does not usually think of other people in a genuine way. She is like her grandmother in the sense that, as long as it looks right, it is best not to look under the surface too much. This is opposite of Lorelai who, despite her many flaws, is hugely a substance over appearances person.

Rory is also secretive and, at least in latter seasons, thinks she knows more about the world than she does. This makes her stubborn and often dismissive of other people, people she has no good reason to disregard so completely because they have never oppressed her to her detriment (or even benefit). This includes not only her mother but everyone in the town and almost everyone else she knows. Rory has had permission and encouragement to be Rory from day one. Her emotions about herself are, thus, strong. She feels pride and disappointment in herself very, very deeply.

Her emotions concerning other people are always much more superficial; she is quick to move on, to keep a grudge, give the silent treatment, shut herself off from the consequences of her social interactions and press on with her daily life/duties. I feel that she is not always sincere in her concern and she is only a decent friend to Lane because Lane is permissive of Rory's self-cantered nature and corrects her. This is not to say that I hate Rory because I don't.

She has many attributes that I appreciate but I think I am much more aware of her flaws this time around because I changed direction in my own life.

** Dean**

This leads us to Rory's love interests. The first time I loved Dean; I liked the stability and the huge ego boost that comes from dating someone who envelops you so completely with his attention and possessiveness. I was flattered by Dean and Deans everywhere and thought that there was nothing wrong with dating someone without similar life aspirations to yours.

When I first watched the show, I had never had a relationship and was oblivious to the dangers of Dean-ness. When I did eventually get myself a Dean as a first boyfriend (and forgotten all about GG of course), it all became clear. Yes, it does become a problem down the road when one is academically inclined and the other is set to work for life in a grocery store (yes, it was that similar): as time goes on and the initial gloss of being in love fades, you have less things to talk about, what matters to one person does not matter to the other, you notice their friends are people you would not be friends with, one world is expansive while the other is content with being what it has been since early adulthood.

This would all not be so bad if Dean and ""Dean"" were actually good guys, but they are not. It starts off great. You feel secure and elevated in his eyes and you enjoy the jealous side because you do not know better. As times goes on, you notice he tends to explode at little things that you do not always expect. This makes you scared, so you start hiding some things. You eventually start hiding whole pieces of yourself because Dean uses feelings as a trading chip and often walks away from the relationship or makes you feel guilty and awful for things that just happen in life, like losing a bracelet or not hearing the phone ring when he calls. You catch yourself not telling your best friend all the things he did because your friend will not understand that he is a good guy and you do not want your best friend to think badly of him. Then you realize that Dean is actually verging on abusive and this is the psychological abuse everyone is talking about. It is not big or flashy and it always has you wondering if you are just exaggerating like he always says you are. But no, if you are scared of your SO, it has to be abuse or a tendency towards it.

So Dean, I am sorry but this time, I thought you were not okay. Worst of all, Dean is not misunderstood or going through a phase. Dean will never be okay and he will only get worse with time.

** Jess**

Jess, first time around, broke up Dean and Rory and so he got on my bad side. This time, however, he seemed much better. He did not actually break them up as much as show Rory she was in a bad relationship. I was never much for angsty teens, so that aspect of his relationship with Luke and other adults I still do not find attractive but I am much more forgiving of it.

So what if Jess has been bludgeoned in the head repeatedly by puberty and thinks he is all deep and tortured and alone while everyone else is terrible? It's oh-kay. He will grow up. He will be a much better person than Dean and he will be a great guy because, even underneath the raging angst, one can see the guy has tenderness in him.

I do not think he really loves Rory because I am dismissive of a relationship so short and problematic resulting in love. Love is much stronger than that. I am certain that he does think he loves her and that is enough for a teen romance. In short, Jess was all right this time and for the time they were together.

** Logan**

Logan, I totally did not get last time. Like Lorelai, he was also just too wild for my taste. Also, at the time I was intimidated by college guys who chose not to get tied down and slept around. I lacked the self confidence to not compare myself to such a boyfriend's previous exploits and it made me feel very unsafe.

It turns out, however, that people who are adventurous and fun sometimes have less behavioural complexes when they do finally choose to enter a relationship. This is because they are not attracted to the concept of the relationship and they do not need commitment as validation so when it comes as a choice (and real choice exists only when there are equally attractive alternatives such as being single and free and having a good time) it is much more conscious and valuable.

Additionally, now that my group of friends and I have grown up a bit it has become very obvious that the guys who lived single and intensely at some point in their early adulthood are more fulfilled and better, more understanding boyfriends when they choose to let that go for a girl.

It is not a case of bad boy gone good. It is a case of someone living independently of you and you of them and choosing to merge it and complement each other and being better for it. Logan is pretty awesome actually.
He is interesting and very intelligent, has a ton of spark, few psychological hangups, is genuinely open to new things, which is immensely valuable when people start growing older and can make all the difference in a couple's future happiness.

Best of all, while he becomes a great boyfriend, you never get the feeling that Logan would be lost without Rory. This is not lack of interest or passion, it is a natural by-product of being someone worth dating. Yes, he has little regard for his dad's property despite taking advantage of it when he wants to; this seemed like such a huge flaw before but it seems to me now that maybe Logan realizes that money is cool but... whatever. It is not everything. Sink the boat, there is more where that came from. Sink a relationship, sink a person, sink life? Eh, maybe not.

**There is also his difference from Jess:** Jess has to try hard and look like he is trying hard no matter what he is doing because Jess is rather attracted to drama. Logan is not attracted to drama, unless it includes a British policeman uniform. Logan is a no-drama kind of guy. Logan is the guy that lets you flourish and lights up your day and you feel free to tell him he's a being a douche because instead of sulking, he will just grin and try to not be a douche (and it will not even look like he is trying).

Strangely, I sometimes think Logan is what Lorelai could have become sans pregnancy. A Logan type, devil-may-care, fast, intelligent, wild but loyal rich girl. Or she would have sunk into depression and killed herself at a DAR meeting, who knows.

** Emily and Richard**

Last but not least, some other observations. Emily and Richard are not evil people or aliens or I don't know what, which was my conclusion the first time.

They are what their background and life made them. They are guilty of not breaking free at some point and re-claiming some of themselves, Richard from his work, Emily from her structured, rigid propriety, both from their approach to life.

Emily and Richard are good souls but they lack the skill of true communication. They think that being in touch is communication and they deposit little of themselves/request little of the other person in these interactions.
Emily is always surprised when she is left out of the girls' daily lives and does not know who they are dating because, in her mind, THAT is communication. What she fails to get is that communication is also when Lorelai makes food talk and when Rory says something silly etc. She is quick to dismiss this kind of interaction as unwanted, unstructured, pointless and fails to understand that this is what bonds people.

I feel sorry for Emily and Richard because, like Lorelai does, I want them to be happy and I want them to have a relationship with their daughter but I know that they will never be able to. I am also mad at them for smothering Lorelai and thinking that throwing money at her was a valid parenting strategy, because I have been through it and it sucks.

Unlike Lorelai, it took me more than 16 years to figure out that I can reclaim my own happiness if only I keep a little bit of distance but I got there, without the kid. The one thing I am scared of is growing up to find out I am becoming more like Emily than Lorelai.

If you read all of that, good job. Now, get yourself a hobby because man, that was long.

I started when I was about 15 around 2005, and ABC Family played an episode a day, so I'd watch it everyday, and then when it finished it would just loop back to the beginning and I watched it like that for years, plus catching the last two seasons live. I'd say I've probably watched it at least once a year since then, so I'm definitely in the double digits, but Netflix has made it even easier. When i'd watch an episode a day I found it was easier to watch on loop, but I find I have to space it a little bit more now. 

I'm amazed to find how many details about the show I forget between watches, and just how funny I find certain lines even though I know exactly when they are they coming.

We always talk so much about those indispensables relationships on the show, but what about those magic screen times below? I always thougth it was a very interesting dialogue or chemistry between them. Please give me your opinion about it (and add some new matches by your own perspective) and tell us why.


This is my personal thoughts:


* **Lorelai and Lane**
I loved the way Lorelai was a big friend not only for Rory, but specially for Lane too. I think Lorelai was very sympathetic 

with Lane's mothers's issues by identifying with her. Loved how Lorelai let Lane live there when she needed and how she always talked to Mrs Kim in awkward scenes to defend Lane's interests. Lorelai really loved Lane and they had a cute relationship.


* **Lorelai and Paris**
A little similar to Lane's, but how amazing was Lorelai to identify Paris as an lonely girl and give her space to talk about her life when she needed the attention? That odd and cute hug Paris gave her, while she used her permission to step by and have lunch at the inn, was an amazing scene. I Wish we'll see more of this on the show.


* **Rory and Mitchum**
I know, everybody thinks that Mitchum is an ass (he is), but giving those ""truth's speech"" for Rory was one of the most important thing that happen to her career. The way Rory respected Mitchum's image fell apart then and turned out to be one of the biggest motivation that Rory needed to persue even harder her wishes. I liked the way Mitchum recognized later how important Rory was for Logan's improvement and how directly he was to not take anything personal, even if he had the most unethical reasons for trying to une forces with Rory. Ironically, Rory left Logan for  be that person Mitchum didn't believe she could be.


* **Emily and Chritopher**
Is really odd how Emily did not like Christopher, but then accepted him thinking he was the ""less worst"" for her daughter since Emily was always so worried about society's judgment about Lorelai's single and independent life. Who can't love that scene when she  was trying to break Lorelai and Luke up and went to Christopher with the perspection of ""accept"" him, but Emily has zero touch to deal with people and was horrible unconfortable. We can see how much humiliating she considered the situation. I love Emily's conflictuous feeling about Christopher, even when she tried to awkwardly set him up with another woman. She is such a figure when she tries to solve ""people's problems"".

* **Emily and Mrs Kim**
What happens when two general style's moms meet? I think a dispute between Emily and Mrs Kim would be like WWIII.


* **Richard and Logan**
I always had the impression that Richard saw, at first, Logan a little like himself. He understood those Yale's traditions and liked him as the whole model he wished to Rory (and for Lorelai before). Then, when he found out about Rory having sex with him, he ultimately put Logan on the Christopher's landing: the boy who was there to derail his brilliant girl again. Glad that happened, cause in the end, He and Emily could accept that Rory was able to being a independent girl, not necessarily should marry a fancy boy to be happy and fancy boys wasn't perfect as they thought it before.  


* **Richard and Luke**
We're all aware that Richard never dreamed about Lorelai dating a guy like Luke, but maybe he tried to transform Luke in a real son in law. I mean, Richard was more polite than Emily and wanted Luke to became a sucessful diner's manager (the society's ""good enough"" reason), but I think if Edward was alive now, we would have a shot to see Richard really satisfied with Lorelai's happiness choice. 


* **Luke, Taylor and Kirk**
The greatest humor scenes are there. Luke's moody personality is so awesome when he meets the two most annoying people (In a good way) of Stars Hollow. That car's scene was simply the best hit on the show. Kirk is a completely non-sense person and I love how he respects Luke enough to wanting his advices, even when Luke tries to reject and get away from him all of the time. Taylor, otherwise, affects the super defensive Luke's way to be. Luke is always introvert and worried about his space while Taylor has no respect for anybody's business. I hope to see way more of this in november.


* **Lane and Dean**
Not so explored than the others, in the first season, I really liked the way Dean and Lane could be nice friends. Everything 
looked so easy and joyful for Rory then, it's always weird when good friends don't get along with love interests, but I always had the feeling that Lane liked Dean the most of Rory's choices. Keiko even is rooting for Dean.


* **Paris and Logan**
The extremely mismatch couple. When I first saw Logan, I thought he could be like an Tristan 2.0, but the difference between them appeared when Paris completely rejected Logan's personality. Before this, Paris was madly in love with the idea of dating a guy just like him (Tristan), and then, after Asher, Paris seemed to mature for guys and had more crush with a intelectually sweet crazy ~~like her~~ Doyle. I always thought it was kind of funny the way Paris always criticized Logan to Rory, always expecting the worst from him and how patient Logan was with Paris's craziness to respect Rory. Funnier was how she was absolutely shocked with the idea that Rory ""tied him down"" and started to respect their relationship in a Paris's insane way.

Her character in the beginning of the series has moments of seeming very strong, but she is not one to put herself out there in new situations and needs Lorelai to defend her with Emily all of the time. While she isn't without friends, it's kind of sad that she doesn't really have friends her own age sans Lane. (not that she needs a ton of friends, but more than one good friend her own age would be nice).

I also think it makes for very interesting storytelling because ASP doesn't really make you feel like there is anything wrong with the protected Stars Hollow bubble Rory lives in during those seasons, but then we get to see the natural consequences of moving into a world where not everyone is going to love and respect her the way all of the people of Stars Hollow did.

I think end of late S6/all of S7 Rory is worth all of the uncomfortable feelings we have to go through from season 4 on. She comes out being with much better social skills that seem to give her a lot more confidence where networking is concerned, as well as the ability to take charge of the paper. She stands up to Mitchum and fights to get the job she really wants (even though she never mentions it again...) and she finally makes friends with a couple of people her own age  who she just has fun with.

1. Chris was not in the wrong to meet up with Lorelai for lunch after Rory told him not to talk to her mother. First, it was Lorelai who called him.

Imagine this: Chris tells Rory to stop seeing someone. Rory would probably still see that person because she has a right to. 
2. Chris and Lorelai is such a complex relationship. One is not better than the other. Chris going to Lorelai after finding out Sherry is pregnant. Lorelai going to Chris right after the Luke breakup. They both hurt and use each other for their emotional needs.
3.  I wasn't mad at Emily and Chris when Luke and Lorelai first broke up. I was more mad at Luke. He KNEW about Emily's ways. He also KNEW that Lorelai loved him and probably KNEW as well that Lorelai would pick him over her mother. It was such a stupid fight because he probably knew how Lorelai is so committed to him.

Most names on the show I don't find that compelling to analyze. The double Lorelai is obvious. Sookie St. James is really strange but I don't know what to make of it.

But Logan. It's always felt out of place to me. I love how accurate the show is about absurd rich names like Straub, Hanlon, Pennilyn, Fallon, going by nicknames like Trix and Sweetie, and stately names like Emily, Richard, Louise, Vivian. I have tangential interaction with some old money folks and this is so accurate. 

Disregarding the two bit gold digger Shira, you have Elias, Mitchum, and Honor. All rich sounding names. Logan just doesn't sound old money. It makes me wonder if ASP intentionally chose a less pretentious name because she wanted Logan to be more relatable, more able to fit with Rory with one foot in Stars Hollow and one in old money estates.

Anyway, there's also the L thing. Lorelai, Luke, Lorelai  Leigh, Logan, Lane, Lenny Lott, Liz.

There are things like Lorelai marrying Max that I think we all knew would never happen.. and then there are things like April's appearance where it wasn't really a decision point for anyone.

Some things I often think about:

* Christopher stays with Lor long distance, doesn't marry Sherry. Rory goes to Harvard and Lor moves to Boston with Chris (too happy ending, I know)

* Rory chooses to run off with Jess for the summer. They burnout when they realize they can't build a life together and she isn't a teen anymore (similar to Dean Part III)

* Logan isn't into Rory, or he dumps her - she feels vulnerable and exploits Marty's affections. She dates clingy Marty while trying to get Logan's attention or find someone else to date.. Kinda like when she was with Dean Part II.

* Luke tells Lorelai about April right away. They meet and hit it off. What would happen? I can't picture it.

* Lorelai listens to Rory and lets her take a semester off and be in Stars Hollow. How would THAT have played out?

In the episode 'Secrets and Loans', Rory tells Emily that they have termite damage to their home and can't afford the repairs. Emily immediately heads for her chequebook and Lorelai takes the pen off her to stop her writing a cheque, putting it in her purse. Emily asks if she's getting the pen back and Lorelai replies with ""Yeah, after dinner"".

In a later episode 'Lost and Found', Rory realises she's lost the bracelet Dean made her. When looking under the couch, Lorelai asks ""Did you find anything?"" to which Rory responds with ""Just Grandma's pen"". Lorelai then tells Rory to leave it there because ""It makes life fun"".

Maybe I'm jumping too far to connect the dots here, but I like to think it's the same pen and that was a nice throwback :)",10,92,False,self,,,,,

As provided by Director of Photography, Michael A. Price,  the show made with really great naturalistic lighting - through vibrant  colours and stark shadows that channeled  the warmly picturesque yet true-to-life visuals, that all so heavily contributed in making  the charming world Lorelai and Rory inhabit, as inviting and comfortable for the audience as it is for them.



Until season 6 and 7.


What was once probably one of the secretly best lit shows on TV, now looks cheap, horribly desaturated and waaaay too bright. The sets now visibly look like sets, there's very little difference between day and night, the actors'  are unflatteringly overlit, the colours are now horribly washed out and proper use of shadow and sunlight doesn't seem to exist, therefore taking away any sense of depth or detail. Basically, it inexcusably looks like a higher budget daytime soap. From the 90s.




The issues actually started in season 5 with the loss of Michael A. Price, (who was the longest running DoP, from the end of season 1 to the first few episodes of season 5) but the issues become fully apparent across 6 &amp; 7 with one of the most jarring downgrades in a series' visuals I've ever seen; and yet, no one really talks about it.


So being the weirdo I am, I made two imgur albums comparing the great lighting of the show in its formative years to the hideous lighting in the last two seasons. Hopefully this illustrates to people who did or didn't ever really notice, see just how bad it is lined up together and discuss something that has bugged me since the original airings.

The only time I've ever seen it brought up (that I can remember) is in We Got Us A Pippi Virgin, when Lorelei offers a drink to Dean and he says he will take a beer, and then Luke pipes up about Dean not being 21.

I have been watching the series in a bingey manner, but not necessarily in the right order.

I am beginning to believe that I alone in this opinion, but here it is: I blame Lindseys mother. 
  
Obviously, Dean is responsible for the cheating. He made the choice to marry her, he said the vows. He screwed up. I think the marriage failed for many, many reasons. They were teenagers, Dean was still in love with Rory and Dean had this picturesque idea of the ideal marriage. But I want to look at one factor which, I feel, is rarely discussed: The marriage failed because Lindseys mom pushed them into the specific lifestyle she wanted. Heres why:

-	Lindsey is basically a non-character. What do we actually know about her? She bought Rory a magnet once, she cant cook, and shes very close to her mom. 

-	Her Mom is WAY into the wedding and marriage. I know that men tend to stay out of wedding planning but the only references we have regarding wedding preparations involve Lindsey and her mom planning.

-	At 19 she is thrown into the life of a house wife who cant cook and is bored. We never find out if she wanted a career, if she likes to cook, nothing. All we know is that her mom helps her with all of her new domestic duties (except in the bedroom, I presume)

-	After the wedding, you almost never see Lindsey and Dean without a reference to her parents. Lindsey and her Mom make Dean lunch every day and deliver it together. 

-	Lindseys mom is already making references to their little one very early into the marriage and when they are still teenagers. I know theyre married and, presumably, they would have had kids together, but that seems a little pushy to me. 

-	In one episode Luke finds Dean in the arcade at night. Dean tells him that Lindsey and her mom want him out of the way while they clean up, and he just slips out and no one notices hes gone. Later on, Lindsey will complain that Dean is never home and shes lonely. If we assume Dean is telling the truth, Lindsey is with her Mom all day. They cook and serve lunch together, they cook and eat dinner together and they clean up dinner together. When is she alone and missing Dean??

-	To this point, I can totally see Lindseys Mom pushing Lindsey and Dean to buy a town house. Sure, a small one bedroom is standard and sufficient for a couple, but when her Mom and Dad are always there, it would be very small. Especially if Lindseys Mom is already pushing for grand-kids. (thought I might be over blowing that one comment because I dont like her) 

-	Even after Dean cheats, Its Lindseys Mom who yells and gets mad and Rory. Lindsey is silent and is, literally, led along by her mom. 

Im sure some of these points can be contested and de-bugged, and please do share your thoughts. Individually, each of these wouldnt be bad but I feel the whole of the way they present the whole marriage and Lindseys moms relationship with them just screams that her Mom wanted her daughter to be her housewife buddy.

Well, I come bearing a great update!


We performed a great show in front of a sold out (!!!) audience and were able to be picked up through the rest of 2016.  Our next show is TOMORROW (9/22) at 9 PM. We have a guest monologist who has been on Girls, Broad City, and performs at two of the most reputable improv shows @ the UCB theater. 

The audience was full of gillies and it was great meeting everyone and commiserating at the theater and bar afterwards!

I hope you guys in the tri-state area can make it to this or the next officially scheduled one on 10/22 - tickets are available for only 5 buckaroos! 

We plan on filming the 10/22 performance as well for all you out-of-towners!

 I've been listening to the podcast for over a year now, but I just got into the sub a lot more recently. I think I liked the podcast and the Facebook comments sections a lot more before I got on here and realized how much better the dialogue is here.

I made my peace with the podcast not being an in depth analysis of the show pretty earlier, and I usually appreciate that it keeps things more fun and light. I love hearing the perspectives from guests who have worked in TV before. And honestly nothing makes a podcast like actually being prepared and organized and I feel like Demi and Kevin are really very good at it.

But I almost wish we had a good, well produced podcast that did go in depth, and wasn't spoiler free, and was discussed by actual super fans.

I do really love the podcast. It makes me actually look forward to Monday morning and I feel like they were definitely partly responsible for bringing the show to a whole new level of popularity, but I guess I'm just really feeling how lacking their discussion is compared with what I've been experiencing here.

I think they establish Rory and Logan as being way too comfy there considering how long they've been together, and they literally never mention any trips here until this episode, and they've clearly been enough times where they have routines and regular spots they frequented.

I don't actually know why Luke was so awful in this episode, because while he is generally a bit of a wet blanket, he's at least pleasant when Lorelai wants to do something. I get him blowing his opinion of Logan out of proportion, but he just seems to be upset past the point of reason with everything.

I think the comparison of Lorelai's relationship with Rory's is really interesting, and I think it shows this weird dynamic where Rory has grown to be really mature and has been able to build a relationship that shows a lot of growth, support, appreciation, things Lorelai's relationship is suddenly lacking. There is a lot of Lorelai reflecting on her own relationship in this episode and I think that is done really well.

I think this is a great glimpse of what Rory's life could be like with Logan's as well, and personally it seems really great. Even how welcoming Logan is to both Lorelai and Luke seems like everything you'd want in a boyfriend.

Sorry to u/VisenyaRose, who I just got into a discussion about this with, who also has some really great opinions on this episode, but I was curious to get an idea of how everyone else saw this episode.

So, what do you all think about this episode? Do you think it's just awful? Do you hate just because it's not fun to watch? Do you think this episode is in or out of character for the main characters here?

If you just straight hate it, please be explicit about why.

During the original show there never was a real need for it, since they did not seem to be too far apart. But now Luke's actor is nearly 60, and he looks the part (not saying that he looks bad or old, because he doesn't, he just looks his age), so if Luke is supposed to be Lorelai's/Lauren's age (mid to late 40s), I don't think the show will be able to pull that off. 

Scott is older than Kelly Bishop was when she started the show, to put it into perspective. I know that it is rude to discuss someone's age so publicly, and I don't mean to imply anything bad, I just think that if they will try to make Scott look younger, it will not end good. It looks like they will, because they gave him that hairpiece to cover up bis baldness, which I fear will just look silly. Again, not Scott's fault; Kelly Bishop looked amazing when GG started (she still does), but nobody would have believed her to be in her mid to late 40s either. 

I just fear that we will get this vibe that he/the hair and makeup department tries way too hard to cover something up that can not and should not (!) be covered up. I fear that it will look unnatural and awkward.

I would much rather prefer them to not do anything and we will just see and deduct ourselves that Luke must be a little bit older than Lorelai. Or they could throw in some quick reference regarding it. As far as I know, there is nothing in the original show to force them to make Scott appear younger.

Frankly, I never understood why Rory and Paris were the only characters in their 20s allowed to get the ending they wanted, professionally I mean. What did Lane do to deserve Zach and twins?

Let me be clear: there is NOTHING wrong with getting married and having kids, or going to a fancy college or not going to college or going to a mediocre one or whatever, if that is what you want. 
Alas, that was not what Lane wanted. Lane wanted to rock in a band. Also, I know shit happens and plans change but did they have to exemplify that with Lane? Why, because she didn't go to an ivy league college(or finish college at all, really)? I really feel like the message here is that since Lane didn't go to college(much less a fancy one like Rory and Paris) and her career of choice was not one that society(usually) considers a traditional one, she could only end up a knocked up housewife to a dim dude like Zach.

So no, it's not that I think Zach is evil, or that he ruined Lane's life or that I think children or marriage(especially when young) are the worst thing that could happen to someone, it's that I don't see why they chose this storyline for Lane, while giving every other character what they wanted.

I heard that LDB had shooted a Tango's romantic scene with professional dancers and they were pretty dressed up. Since Honor and Shira won't returning either, I don't think it's Rory and Logan also.

Well Rory was 20 at the time of their first date. Meaning Luke only met Rory possibly when she was 12 (or older). I also vaguely remember it being mentioned that it took a few years for Luke to warm to Lorelai and them to become friends. Now we'd assume that Lorelai was friendly with Luke before her 12 year old daughter was especially because it is repeatedly said that Luke used to not like kids.

Well we start watching when Rory is 16 - so if a 'few years' was even taken as 2 years it would mean Luke wasn't close to Lorelai and Rory until Rory was 14. 

So how was he a father figure throughout her childhood as mentioned a lot especially in the letter for his court case?

He only met her when she was 12? And she seems to be quite a mature 16 year old when we meet her.

I've seen some appreciation here and there, but I'm curious for to hear more about that perspective.

I personally don't find him physically attractive and his personality doesn't do much for me either, so outside of his interaction with Paris, I find his character to super bland and boring. I do see how that matches well with Rory at that time in school, but I think he's more of a social crutch for Rory more than anything.

I also don't really care one or another about what he does in season 7 because I think him being with Lucy makes total sense, and him acting weird and butt hurt with Rory seems totally in character to me.

I am rewatching 06x05 right now, the episode in which Rory throws that DAR function that is a total success. She loved it! She was flying across that room, totally happy and cheery; I got the impression that she enjoyed every part of it. She was much more outgoing and confident than usual. And let's face it, she is a natural planner. Even Mitchum acknowledged that, albeit in a very rude and hurtful way.

I just got the feeling that she was totally in her element, and I never got this feeling when I saw her being a journalist. Obviously, just organizing DAR functions would not be enough for her, but a career in event planning would suit her. She could have been running a successful business by now. 

This path would suit her personality much better than being a foreign TV correspondent who has to appear on TV. I am not saying that she is a bad journalist, because I am sure she is great, but I think she would make an even better event manager.",25,21,False,self,,,,,

While I understand the sentiment, I think there should be a good amount of decision making that happens before a proposal is accepted (ideally though before the proposal is made). And I think considering the fact that Lorelai goes into all three proposals without hashing out any plans for the future, proves that there is more to getting married than just feeling it in that moment. With Max he won't even let her ask where they are going to live until she says yes, with Luke he doesn't find out she doesn't want to move until after they've already agreed to get married, and with Chris they don't really talk about Gigi taking over Rory's room (which honestly seems like an inadequate set up for both Rory and Gigi).


Do you think that the fact that Rory wasn't immediately certain she wanted to get married is a sign that she wasn't ready?

She says if Mrs. Kim doesn't want Lane to do it, that's her right as a parent.

Then a few episodes later, Rory invites Lane to go see the bangles. When Mrs. Kim ultimately says no and Rory breaks the news to Lorelai, she tells Lorelai that Lane decided to be stupid and tell Mrs. Kim the truth. Lorelai conirms, ""stupid.""

Not to mention, Lane is frequently at Lorelai's house engaging in ""forbidden"" activities.  Hell, Lorelai regularly feeds Lane forbidden foods.

So, Lorelai, where do you actually stand on letting Mrs. Kim make her own parenting decisions?
