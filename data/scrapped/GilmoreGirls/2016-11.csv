Not only is that the middle of the night for many people but it's also a holiday so not everyone will be able to watch the show immediately. We want this subreddit to be a safe place for any Gilmore Girls fan to visit even if they haven't had a chance to watch the new episodes! To this end, we have a few guidelines for posting:

* **Titles must be spoiler free!** Any titles with spoilers will be removed and repeat offenders may be banned. Here are some examples of (hypothetical!) spoiler titles:

 * I can't believe Rory is marrying Kirk!

 * Why did Taylor and Lorelai break up?

 * My favorite scene was when Emily confessed her undying love for Michel!

 * Do you think Sookie would have still become a famous movie star if they'd stuck to Jackson's ""four in four"" plan?

* **Any posts containing revival spoilers in the body of the post must have [Revival Spoilers] in the post title or it will be subject to removal.** This is in an effort to protect those browsing from mobile apps or from the front page who may not be able to see our flair.

* **We have link flairs!!** If you're posting about revival storylines, please flair your post with ""Revival Spoilers."" You can do this by clicking the ""flair"" button after your post has been submitted and choosing ""Revival Spoilers.""

* **Please use common sense in the comment sections!** If the OP of a post indicates that they are only on the second episode, please don't post spoilers from the third or fourth episodes without the appropriate spoiler tags! Please use [ text]( # s ) (remove the spaces) to format spoilers, this can also be found on the sidebar. Untagged comments will be removed at a moderator's discretion and repeat offenders may be banned.

* **Please feel free to use the report button if you see a post or comment you feel needs a moderator's attention!** We are a small mod team and cannot be on every thread at all times. The report button is anonymous and is the fastest way to get our attention.

* **We reserve the right to remove duplicate posts** if there is already an active discussion about your topic in our subreddit. We recommend doing a search before posting.

We will post a discussion thread for each episode. We ask that commenters refrain from posting spoilers for episodes after the episode being discussed, for example if you've seen all four episodes, please don't post episode 4 spoilers in the episode 2 discussion thread without using a spoiler tag. Spoilers can be formatted using [ text]( # s ) (remove the spaces).

And as always, be kind to each other. One thing that makes this subreddit great is that the users are nearly always respectful to each other, even when disagreeing. We're all here for the same reason, because we love GG so let's make sure everyone has a great experience!",17,67,False,self,,,,,

We will be removing reposted topics at moderator discretion in an effort to reduce clutter.

Please bear in mind that we are a pretty small mod team and aren't able to monitor the sub 24/7. We have received over 700 new submissions (and counting!) since Netflix released the new episodes. We are trying our best to keep spoilers contained within clearly marked threads, but we can't be in every thread all the time. If you are not caught up on the new episodes, *please browse our sub at your own risk!*

Thanks and happy discussing :)

Seeing all the characters in their original forms -- without years of becoming somewhat caricatures of themselves is so refreshing.


Ms. Patty teaching her dance students while splicing in fragments of her glory days, smoking a cigarette when the memories get too real.


Luke acting nonchalant and witty, while bantering with Lorelai.
And Lorelai just seems so much more genuine... less dramatic, sharper and yet still vulnerable.


Even by Season 6, the characters were still loveable but they just became parodies of themselves to a degree. Luke lost some of his appeal as his story lines got more dramatic (in my opinion... totally get that some people may not agree).

Jess calls her, makes time for her, even though he is not into town events. Rory considers losing her virginity to him in episode 14 even though he sort of screwed up sporting a black eye to dinner at her grandmother's and then refusing to tell Rory where it came from. Then in episode 15 Jess starts changing. He stops calling her to hang out and there begins the decline in their relationship. 

In my experience, people do tend to get too comfortable later on in their relationships and change accordingly. Jess explained this best in episode 10 when Rory tries to get him to come to the winter carnival. She brings up the fact that he had participated in town events in the past. Jess says to her that is when he was trying to ""get"" her, and he now has her so he has no need to participate anymore. It's a big relationship no no IMO.

I have also run into the dating dilemma of when a partner gets too 'attached' or 'involved' and bolt due to them experiencing brand new feelings (i.e. love) they had never encountered with anyone else. Also HUGE no no.

all signs are pointing to a pretty obvious l&amp;l wedding to me. that being said, i seem to be the only one here (or one of very few) that is excited to see this, and i want to know why. In my mind neither of them got married because marriage was just so shitty to them at that point, with nicole, max and chris and their own engagement history they easily could have decided that marriage was just bad luck to them and they just wanted to take a different route.

with richards death and Lorelai's watching emily go through everything and her thinking about her own life at that point, i don't see it as just catering to the fans, maybe it is but its not  a huge stretch of a storyline that makes no sense.

(It's his first time. We'll get as far as we can before the new episodes.) So we're in season 1 now. When they had the Willy Wonka night, Lorelai grills Dean about ""she's not going on your motorcycle."" He says he doesn't have a motorcycle. (It's important to note that Rory was out of the room and later indicated she couldn't hear Lorelai and Dean's conversation, at least not completely.) 

Then just a few episodes later when they arrange the double date with Lane and Todd, Dean says they work on their bikes together. I always kind of blew this off, thinking either a) he meant bicycles, or b) the writers just kind of slacked on the details and forgot about the motorcycle comment earlier. Even though it seems mighty quick to have forgotten about it. 

At the end of that episode, Rory climbs up to Lane's window and says that Dean and Todd went muffler shopping. Which would indicate that (b) is correct. 

Except. 

Except we never, over the course of the show, see him riding a motorcycle or even looking like he rode a motorcycle. Plus, it won't be too long before Dean unveils the car he's building for Rory. What if he wanted a cover for his time spent away and having to buy parts as ""working on his motorcycle"" until he told her the surprise? Since Rory wasn't sitting there when Lorelai made the motorcycle comment that he rebuffed, she couldn't have piped in and said, ""Yeah he does, he works on it all the time"" or anything like that. 

I think the next episode we're watching is the Breakup Part 1. I cannot remember if Dean makes any more motorcycle comments after revealing the car on the date. So I wonder if his cover of ""working on our bikes"" is to keep the car a surprise.

 I mean, I get it's what ASP was going for but honestly it just makes me hate the townspeople.

I know the town was just waiting to pounce on Jess but I don't get why there is SO much vitriol especially considering the town likes Luke and should, by extension, try to like his nephew. Any theories?


I guess my biggest qualm with this show is how much everyone is a hyperbole. Lane with her music obsession and absurdly strict Korean mom, Sookie with her inability to think about anything but food, Paris being bratty and hyper-competitive, etc. I mean, sometimes it works (like with Kirk) but other times I think it really brings down the realism of the show.

Examples: Rory acts pouty and bitter because Logan is the first guy (or person) to not throw himself all over her feet and bottle her farts for perfume. In ""Wedding Bell Blues"", when she sees him with his friend at the vow renewal. Then, she treats Marty poorly because she's caught up in trying to get and keep Logan's attention. Another example, ""Jews and Chinese Food"" when she steamrolls Marty into hanging out just the two of them, then just ditches the plan because Logan happened to show up at her door. Then at dinner when the bill comes to $75/pp, you can tell she balks, but just falls back on Logan's offer to pay for her (like she falls back on her rich grandparents for everything all while pretending not to be privileged), and then treats Marty condescendingly (in that I'm-Super-Nice-Not-At-All-Condescending way only Rory does).

The way she insists on birth control when talking to Rory makes me think she was pretty clueless and might not have used any protection back then. 

Also, how much of Lorelai's rebellious attitude came from having an emotionally distant yet overbearing mother? I know I said I don't believe the Gilmore's house was the horror house Lorelai makes it out to be and I stand by that, but there is no denying(imho) the fact that Lorelai didn't get warmth or understanding from Emily. I doubt she ever could go and talk to Emily even about normal teenage angst.

I think there's two different informations on the article and this can make it a little biased (I wouldn't doubt they did on purpose just to break our minds).


**The first thing** I see it's that ""The Way It Ends May Feel Open-Ended"" information is about Paris and the possibilty of make more episodes, not about Rory's love life, she answered that when they asked if she would return and if the history can be continued. The story always can be continued, they use that information on the description only to make people feel perplexed and the line is totally out of context there.


**The second thing**, The way I see what she told about Rory, I interpreted like ASP started from a point where Rory not necessarily had found the one yet, but IRL it would be very unlikely that someone would fall in love again or reconnect with somebody from your past like that, but In stars hollow's world is possible, because ASP was able to handle bring those guys back in a natural way for her life and they are still figuring out who they are, just like Rory, this can mean they are changing too. She's not saying Rory will end up alone.


Personally I think is very possible that Rory can end up alone, but is very possible she won't also. The interview is not saying anything especific, IMO.",18,12,False,self,,,,,

Do you know that every night at dinner, the Kennedy clan would sit around the table having lively debates about everything under the sun? They would quiz each other about current events, historical facts, intellectual trivia. Now the Gilmore clan is just as smart and worldly as the Kennedys so come on - somebody - say something.

&gt;PARIS: I mean, come on, Senator Boxer, as one of our foremost Democratic leaders, I ask you  do you really think it looks good to have the American Secretary of the Treasury traveling around with Bono? I mean, I know apparently hes a saint, hes going to save the world, yada, yada, yada, but my God! He never even takes the sunglasses off. We have an image to maintain, dont we? I mean, arent we at least trying to pretend were the superpower in this world? I mean, why not just send Carson Daly over to the Middle East next time Cheney goes, huh? Or hey, hook up Freddie Prinze Jr. with Colin Powell next time he meets with NATO. I mean, hell! Lets hear what Freddie has to say, right?

[A man walks by and the Senator grabs his arm]

&gt;SENATOR BOXER: Oh, great, Doug. Uh, Paris, do you know Republican Congressman Doug Ose from California? You dont? Great. You two will have so much to talk about. Bye. [walks away]

&gt;
&gt;DEAN: Which is?

&gt;RORY: Hillary Clinton.
&gt;
&gt;DEAN: Sounds perfect.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: I know. Shes so smart and tough and nobody thought she could win New York but she did and shes doing amazing, and have you heard her speak?
&gt;
&gt;DEAN: Only when youve played me the thousands of hours of C-SPAN footage you taped.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Shes a great speaker, strong and persuasive with a wonderful presence, and even those suits of hers are getting better.
&gt;
&gt;DEAN: Id include that in the essay.

--

&gt;MR. ROMAINE: Im talking about run of the mill responses, a lack of originality, particularly in the essay category. If I read one more over-adulating piece of prose about Hillary Clinton and her profound influence, my head will explode.

-

&gt;PARIS: Personal anecdote  when I was twelve and I was writing the first of my trial essays in practice for the day Id write my real essay, I chose Hillary Clinton. Then I realized every braindead bint in a skirt would be writing about Hillary, but it was good to clear the pipes. Now, what are some other mistakes?

-

&gt;DARREN: This is a little tradition with us, quizzes at meals. It keeps the Springsteens sharp.
&gt;
&gt;LORELAI: Very Kennedy-esque.
&gt;
&gt;JENNIFER: Mm, we love the Kennedys!
&gt;
&gt;LORELAI: As do we all.

--------

* S4E1:

&gt;LORELAI: Yeah. I forgot that I'd taken something and so I popped a third one and now I'm about ready to sleep with a Kennedy.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Well, I hear Kerry's available.

-

&gt;TAYLOR: No, I understand. You're no longer our little Stars Hollow Rory Gilmore. You belong to the Ivy Leagues right now. It's time to cut those small town ties and go off and do something important like go to drama school or have one of those high-class naked parties with that Bush girl.

----------

* S4E6:

&gt;PARIS: He won't listen to me. [picks up the phone] You won't listen to me! [hangs up] He's in love with the sound of his own voice. You'd think he was already president and I don't want to be Hillary. I don't want to wait for a hundred years while he does his thing so by the time I get my chance, I'm too old to enjoy it.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Well, I don't think Hillary's too old to enjoy it.
&gt;
&gt;PARIS: Fine. Be on his side.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: I'm not on his side. I'm on her side.

--

&gt;LORELAI: Kirk, I promise, just as soon as. . .is that Condoleezza Rice?
&gt;
&gt;KIRK: Yes, it is. I'm a fan, and her big mouth is perfect for shoving mail in.

------

* S5E2:

&gt;LUKE: Today.
&gt;
&gt;LORELAI: See you when Hillary's president.
&gt;
&gt;LUKE: I'll see you later today.

----------

* S5E14: 

&gt;PARIS: We're better than this, you and me. We're the children of Emma Goldman and Hillary Clinton. Strong, independent. We're better than this.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Apparently not.
&gt;
&gt;PARIS: I blame Chilton. Great education, but horrific socialization. We need guidance.

&gt;COLIN: Can we change the music?
&gt;
&gt;GUY: No.
&gt;
&gt;COLIN: Since when did you become Tipper Gore?
&gt;
&gt;GUY: Shut up, Colin.

&gt;
&gt;LORELAI [gasps]: Please wear that to Grandmas!
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Im going to borrow some clothes.
&gt;
&gt;LORELAI: Theres another twenty in it for you!
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Start one of my loads.
&gt;
&gt;LORELAI: Forty if you snap a picture of her seeing it!

-------

* S5E18:

&gt; LORELAI: Okay, well, you know what? Fine. Let her. Its all true. Im tired of protecting people. Of being polite, of worrying about other peoples feelings. Let her get all Condoleezza Rice to my Barbara Boxer if she wants.

-----

* S6E11:

&gt;LORELAI: OK, well first of all, video poker is my calling. (Luke goes over to sit on one of the chairs at the girls? table) I think I'm totally gonna dedicate my life to it. Especially the third machine in the second row of machines as you hit the entrance of Trump Taj Mahal.

---

* S6E16:

&gt;LORELAI: G.G.'s starting school? You're so old. Where is she gonna go?
&gt;
&gt;CHRISTOPHER: Not sure yet. These snotty private schools are impossible. There are waiting lists and psychological tests and blood samples and sworn oaths and dark back-room promises, and every single headmistress looks like Dick Cheney.

----------

* S6E18:

&gt;ROBERT: Oh, my god. I'm not wearing my glasses.
&gt;
&gt;COLIN: They flew off when you did that impression of the old guy getting shot by Dick Cheney.

--------

* S7E8:

&gt; RORY: Um a little bit of everything, that's the great thing about being editor -- you can pretty much give yourself the best pieces. I got to interview Barack Obama a couple weeks ago. He came to speak at campus
&gt;
&gt;HUGO: Really? Did you ask you buddy Barack if he's gonna run in 2008?
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Well what kind of journalist would I be if I didn't?
&gt;
&gt;HUGO: And?
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Standard answer -- ""no current plans."" But I saw a twinkle in his eye.
&gt;
&gt;HUGO: Well, you can't quote a twinkle.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: But you can describe it.

--------

* S7E13:

&gt;RORY: Yeah. We learned about ideal business theory last semester. I'm actually really enjoying his class. I've learned a lot. He's a really good teacher, which isn't always a given, you know. I mean some smart people can't translate their smarts to other people, but he is really good at explaining things, and he makes you want to learn more. Next week, we're gonna split up into 10 groups, and each of us have to create a business plan.
&gt;
&gt;LOGAN: Like ""The Apprentice.""
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Yeah and he's gonna be like Donald Trump, which is ridiculous. [Logan chuckles]

First, back when they were just friends they butted into each other's lives and got all judgey and fighty about stuff that should not have concerned the other person. Ex: when Luke told Lorelai about Jess moving in, Lorelai going on a single date with that younger guy from night school, and Luke moving in with Nicole.  

Second, Luke buys a house without talking to Lorelai. Major no-no! They talk about it and decide no more major decisions without talking with the other one. But then Lorelai buys a dog, which is a fairly major decision, imo, and  Luke starts plans to remodel Lorelai's house. All without talking to each other! Then of course is the major April fiasco.

Hear me out: in exchange for Rory's private school tuition to be paid in full with 0 interest and an extremely lax repayment plan, Lorelai must take 2-3hrs out of her week to sit with her parents, have free pre-dinner drinks poured and refreshed for her (does Lorelai ever make her own drink?), and have a free dinner cooked by a maid. Instead of ranting and raving about how mean her parents are, did Lorelai ever stop to think about how many people take out second mortgages on their home, apply for scholarships, work multiple jobs, declare themselves independent, etc. in order to afford the kind of education Rory received? Did she ever think, while eating her free fresh rabbit dinner and sipping on her free martini, that not everyone has wealthy parents or grandparents to fall back on; that there are parents of kids (or young adults themselves) who worry about how to pay for their next semester of school while cutting back on basic groceries? Did she consider that if it weren't for her parents, Rory definitely would not have gone to Chilton; thus she owes giving her daughter the supposedly brilliant high school education (but certainly not necessary) she received to the people who also feed her once a week? 

I know that Richard and Emily can be self-serving, conniving, manipulative, out-of-touch, and occasionally cruel, but you cannot deny that most of their intentions come from a place they truly believe is best. As an adult and now parent, Lorelai could have tried to understand where they were coming from - even if it was not from a place with which she identified. She could have used this opportunity to build a better relationship, or at least be more thankful. There are definitely strings attached with mostly everything they say and do, and living with that over your head for an undetermined amount of time must be hard (especially for ""free-spirited"" and ""self-sufficient"" Lorelai), but without that, Lorelai was simply unable to give her daughter what she wanted for her - and that is huge.

I grew up with Rory one year ahead of me in school, so in a lot of way a lot of my life I felt like I was following in her footsteps. I recently finished a rewatch and with all the indecision she had leading up to the finale it got me to thinking about where she will be now, since she seems to have a new foggy abyss ahead of her. Journalism has changed so much with the internet since she was in high school, I feel like she could end up almost anywhere. To me, she was always destined for greatness and travel all over the world. As someone who also comes from a small town and wanted to travel and get educated and explore the world...  I've done those things and I'm ready to go back and live that life now.

Wow, a lot to process here. What we know:

* Logan and Rory are sleeping together when she is in London
* They have an open relationship. ""What happens in Vegas""
* Rory is dating Paul while hooking up with Logan. 
* Logan is playing the field 

So, my theory is as follows: Logan proposed and Rory turned him down. At some point Logan moves to London. Rory starts dating Paul but reconnects with Logan when she's on an assignment and they start a friends with benefits relationship. Rory keeps it casual because she isn't ready to settle down. Logan agrees to it because he'll take her any way he can get her. I'm not convinced he's actually playing the field but makes her believe it. 

Does anyone remember in the Spring clip shown at the EW Popfest where Rory says she has to catch a flight? I'm going to believe she's flying to London. 

ETA: Didn't ASP say Rory was ""living in London"". So she's living in London but on Logan's couch? If she's been at his place awhile then she would know if girls leave their things there, no? ",147,11,False,self,,,,,

With the revival almost here, The Mods thought it would be fun to have a prediction flair contest. In this thread, we'll discuss prediction flair for the revival which debuts November 25th 12:00am PST.


**What is Prediction Flair?**  Prediction flair is a game that is open to any and all subscribers of /r/gilmoregirls. The goal is simple: Based only on your information, guess who Rory will end up with (or guess she'll be single, or an outcome you think is likely to occur, etc...) Any time before the start of the revival episode, you must select a prediction flair () with the team name or outcome that you think will have the most chance of happening. After the start of the revival, all predictions will be locked in and no changes will be allowed.


**How do I Select a Prediction Flair?** When logged in, find the Flair panel on the sidebar bar and click the edit link Select the Gilmore Girl flair for the most logical outcome.


**How much does it cost? What do I win?** There is no cost for entry.**We will lock the flairs on November 24th at 11pm EST.**  You will not be able to select or change your flair after this so choose carefully! Those who chose correctly will not only have eternal bragging rights but also be entered to win a month of Reddit Gold! We will randomly choose three people who flaired the correct option to win. Winners will not be chosen until two weeks after the revival to ensure we don't accidentally spoil someone by congratulating them. We will reactivate normal flair options after the drawing.


**I'm on Alien Blue, Reddit is Fun, Bacon Reader, or another Mobile App. Can I still play?**  If nothing has changed, you will be able to see and select a prediction flair on mobile. The flair you get will show your prediction.


**What else do I need to know?**
Don't change your prediction flair if you want credit for an accurate prediction.
NO SRSLY, DO NOT CHANGE YOUR PREDICTION FLAIR IF YOU WANT CREDIT FOR AN ACCURATE PREDICTION. The mod team will do our best to record everyones prediction but sometimes things go wrong and if we can't verify your preseason choice, we may have to deny any requests to restore your flair.
If you press the edit button on the sidebar, do not hit Enter or click Save. This will change your flair. Click anywhere outside of the flair selection panel or, better yet, do not hit edit ever once you're sure of your prediction.

**tl;dr** - Pick an outcome you think will likely happen before the start of the the revival. Post here or Message the mods if you have any questions?",27,12,False,self,,,,,

She kept this from Luke until the Gilmore's vow renewal where she sprung it on him because she was afraid it would come up when they saw Christopher. Luke says he needs some time, Lorelai presses him, which leads to him telling her he can't be in the relationship because ""it's too much.""

Do you think he overreacted? I feel like his reaction is a little extreme considering that he's known Lorelai for years and her family issues aren't new to him. I agree that she shouldn't have kept her night with Christopher from him and she should have just backed off and given him his time but it feels very harsh to jump straight to ""I'm out"" especially considering how long it took him to make a move.

Just for the record, I'm not team Dean and I'm not making this post to be the The Devil's Advocate, I'm just trying to understand the possible option for Dean's behavior and how do you think ASP should had handle this.

Before Jess 
arrived at Stars Hollow Dean was the cute, helpful, patient, comprehensive (you may disagree with my old view of him) boyfriend Rory liked so much. I think at season 1, nobody hated Dean, specially the original viewers. 


Then, Tristan showed up, humiliated him several times, constantly trying to ruin their relationship, clearly harassing Rory and making all kind of trouble. Later, Jess showed up, hating Dean for no reason (correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember Dean doing anything to start their rivalry), making mean jokes about him, decreasing his intellectual capacity and Rory was obviously falling for the guy and hurting Dean over and over and didn't stand by him. 


I know a lot of people will say ""But Dean should break up with her and he took so long"", this obviously was the right to do but I will remember Dean was a 17 year old boy (I didn't know how to pull my shit together when I was 17), immature like we're all probably were for love issues. So I ask you guys, not you with your 2016 mind, how do you think 17 years old you would react?

Do other Lit fans feel a bit, well, short-changed on the Jess/Rory relationship? They got a season on flirting, a season of a (bad) relationship and then a few interactions after that which consisted mostly of Rory rejecting him. Meanwhile Dean got 3 goes at the relationship, and we got to see the cute young love and then when it turned sour the definite ending. With Logan we got 2-3 breakups, them living together and then a proposal and the final breakup.

I feel like their relationship felt very unfinished. I never got any closure, which I feel like the other 2 pairings had. It just seemed strange to me that the writers had Rory back and forth with Dean and Logan, giving them multiple chances when Jess only got one chance. ",25,25,False,self,,,,,

Long story short, husband had agreed to binge the revival with me. He's seen episodes here and there with me, and has mostly enjoyed them. A few weeks ago, he said he wanted to watch the whole thing, so we're halfway through season 2 right now. So we just finished the episode where Lorelai helps Luke look at an apartment, and as she's going on her whole spiel about Luke's current apartment being subpar (""and then she spies....the *single bed!*""), hubby just bursts out laughing. Then starts, ""I don't want them to break up! I know they're not together yet but I don't want them to break up!"" (He's been spoiled on a lot of the bigger plot points because of me watching in the past.) 

So, basically, my husband is a Luke/Lorelai shipper. Huzzah!

**Grandma Gilmore** - well of course that goes without saying.

**Emily** - What a hateful woman. I do not think I have seen a single instance of her committing a selfless act. I thought maybe that the house for Luke and Laura was one such, until her reaction at their breakup made it clear she didn't care at all about their relationship. I've never seen a leading female character who is more of a selfish woman since Olivia in Scandal.  Richard Gilmore is the same to a slightly lesser extent. 

**Rory** - she has some redeeming qualities and seems to care about Lane and Paris, but that is about it. She emotionally cheats on Dean with Jess for months and leads him on, physically cheats on him with Jess, is complicit in ruining Dean's marriage, abandons him again for Logan without a seeming care or attempt to reconcile, cheats on Logan by kissing Jess and never tells him, and I'm pretty sure I remember an episode where she screwed over Jess some way as well.

**Lorelai** - she takes the cake. and I can really see Emily in her. Screws over several love interests (Max, Digger, etc) but I almost quit the show when she ended her relationship with Luke, and then slept with Chris that same night?! Instead of communicating to Luke her issues with the timing of their marriage like an adult, she throws a temper tantrum and gives him an ultimatum. Granted, Luke screwed up by not recognizing the problem, and for acting childish after the breakup, but Lorelai breaks off an engagement when Luke doesn't immediately commit and then sleeps with Chris within an hour?!  Who does that? And now she is dating that douche bag? Who starts dating someone two days after breaking off your engagement?

A bunch of people asked about the surrogacy thread and were confused about why Lorelai might need a surrogate. 

Correct me if I am wrong, but according to the interwebz she is 48 in AYITL. Your chance of getting pregnant with your own eggs at that age, even with IVF, is close to 0. Women in their upper 40s+ (look at Janet Jackson) are using donor eggs in 99+ percent of cases. Sometimes they implant the eggs in their own body, sometimes they use a surrogate. 

Let me be clear that I think this is awesome, but people usually don't publicize it, which I wish they would so people understand realistic fertility expectations. If ASP has Lorelai spontaneously getting pregnant naturally I will be super disappointed, as it isn't even close to realistic.

I myself went through fertility treatments, and I was only Rory's age - 32. 

Just hoping if they have a kid storyline (which would be great!), they adopt, are clear about the egg donation, or it ends up being that Rory is the one pregnant. Again, nothing wrong at all with egg donation but I don't want people getting the wrong idea that getting pregnant at 48 is NBD.

[E! News](http://www.eonline.com/news/809474/the-gilmore-girls-finally-grow-up-a-year-in-the-life-review)

&gt;That's the fan-service at work, but with a few exceptions, the appearances further the character growth for the main Gilmore women, namely Milo Ventimiglia, Matt Czuchry and Liza Weil. 

[UpRoxx](http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-review/2/)

&gt;And Rorys arc often seems like a remnant of whatever plans the Palladinos had for the end of the series, and probably fit a twentysomething Rory more than a thirtysomething one.

&gt;There are a lot of running gags that dont click (including a belabored payoff to the revolving door position of being Emily Gilmores housekeeper) or reflect poorly on the regulars (one character has a new love interest whom everyone else forgets exists the second theyre out of the room).

[Variety](http://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/gilmore-girls-review-a-year-in-the-life-netflix-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-1201917166/)

&gt;Speaking of other men in the orbits of the Gilmore women, A Year in the Life might serve as something of a referendum among fans: How much Logan (Matt Czuchry) did anyone really want? That particular subplot tends to go in circles without acquiring much in the way of depth or texture. Czuchrys performance is faultless, but the show goes to that well more than it should have.

[Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/gilmore-girls-a-year-life-review-946641)

&gt;Rory (Alexis Bledel) is a jet-setting writer and she has a man in her life, but those changes may mask a personal and professional rut. 

&gt;It's better if you pretend that Rory is still in her mid-20s, that you assume that each and every character dynamic is intact and consistent

&gt;She also can't help that Sherman-Palladino, and fans as well I suppose, is hung up on the same guys (Matt Czuchry's Logan and Milo Ventimiglia's Jess play prominent roles here) as in the series, without any hint of moving on. I guess if you're a fan hung up on the idea of Rory and Logan or Rory and Jess, this will play for you, but as a viewer who thought all of the men in Rory's lives were phases she needed to move through and that none of them ever felt like an ""answer,"" it's annoying to find this unchanged.

[EW](http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/16/gilmore-girls-year-life-netflix-revival-review)

&gt;I can tell fans that Rorys three major love interests all return (Jared Padaleckis Dean, Milo Ventimiglias Jess, Matt Czuchrys Logan), and that Rorys situation with Logan, which the revival hits first, is unconventional and complex. Does he represent the future, or is he baggage from the past that must be dropped?

ETA: 

[EW From the Magazine] (http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/15/gilmore-girls-revival-rory-boyfriends) *Rory Gets a Special Ending with One Ex*:

&gt; But with Netflixs Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life just around the corner, could Rory get a happily ever after with one of her exes?

&gt;Well, theyre all set to appear, and the good news is that everyone seems to have grown up. You think back to your first love and it really overtakes you, and I think [Dean] just never really got past that point, Padalecki says. But we see a more mature, 10-years-older Dean in the new Netflix series, and I was really happy with the man he turned out to be.

&gt;Something similar can be said for boyfriend No. 2. Jess ultimately grew up, Ventimiglia says. Where you pick back up with him, hes only become a more refined version of the kid that used to be a troublemaker. He is more caring and caregiving than anything else.

&gt;Then theres Logan. In the original series, I was happy that Rory said no to Logan because I feel like, at that particular time, it wasnt right for Rory to get married to anybody, and it shows her strength and her independence, which has always been I think a very powerful theme of the show, Czuchry says. I love that ending for the original series.

&gt;However, could things end on better terms for Logan and Rory in the revival? In terms of where things are at the end of these four chapters for Logan and Rory, its pretty special. Ill say that, Czuchry says. Its very, very special. Let the fan theories begin!

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/17/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-review)

&gt;The trio of Rorys previous boyfriends (Jared Padalecki as Dean, Milo Ventimiglia as Jess, and Matt Czuchry as Logan) all return in clever ways that echo the roles they played in Rorys former life in Stars Hollow and at Yale.

My question is: weren't Max and Lorelai not supposed to see each other because Max's job was on the line? That was why they took that time apart but then they got together again and got engaged.

So for speculation I thought I'd ask some of my questions here

**Jess, Rory and Luke scene (Video 1 - 0:07)** - Is that in front of Lorelai's house? Why is Rory Giddy? Why is Luke dressed very fancy when Jess and Rory are not?


**Lorelai Drinking Coffee in a nice house? (Video 2 - 0:07)** - Where is this? It looks kind of Spanish Style.

**Rory playing with kids (Video 3 - 0:06)** - Pretty sure those are Paris's kids, but do we think this might be her warming up to the idea of kids? Or she's just doing Paris a favor?

**Rory Interrupting a DAR Meeting (Video 3 - 0:09)** 

**Lorelai Dancing in her house (Video 3 - 0:10)** - Assuming it's her house, she's dancing with cokes, and she looks disheveled, lots of fabric in the background.

**Lorelai and Rory's Hug in the Kitchen (Video 3 - 0:13)** - Matches a still where Lorelai looks emotional

**Lorelai picnicking with? (Video 3 - 0:23)** - Is this still the Spring festival, cause she looks like she's picnicking with someone besides Rory, Luke, or Gyspsy.

**Luke yelling at pool patrons (Video 3 - 0:24)** - I'm getting more and more worried that Lorelai has paid/wooed these two boys into playing servant. I love that Luke is yelling at kids at the pool. Different outfits from the EW clip at the pool

**Rory in Robe (Video 3 - 0:25)** - It's Fall, it kind of looks like a B&amp;B, maybe like the one the LDB do a scene at?

**Jess at the SH Gazette (Video 3 - 0:34)** - I think this confirms that the stills with the brick are also the same place where the heart to heart talk happens, but I'm still confused on the layout of this building

**Lorelai singing(?) at the therapist (Video 3 - 0:44)** - What is she singing? And why is Emily so amused?

**The end of their dangerous car ride (Video 3 - 0:50)** - This asks more questions than it answers, but it kind of seems like Lorelai is surprised and Luke is in the know.

**Definitely Emily getting out of town car (Video 3 - 0:53)** - No other rich person on this show would wear teal from head to toe, right?

**Rory talking nonsense? (Video 4 - 0:19)** - WTF is this?

**Rory and Lorelai Delivering Papers? (Video 5)** - Still not sure why Rory would not only be working for the SH Gazette, but now she is doing delivery too?

**Lorelai giggling at a town meeting with Rory (Video 5)** 

**Rory in a bathrobe (Video 6)** - Looks like a Bed and Breakfast, there are multiple jackets on the bed, one kind of looks like boutonniere.

**Paris kicking doors at chilton (Video 7)** -What is Paris doing?

**Lorelai dancing with cokes (Video 7)** - Lorelai is definitely making a wedding dress

**A 3rd Therapy Session for Lorelai, 2nd for Emily (Video 7)** -Lorelai having fun in therapy

**Lorelai picnicking with random person at IFF (Video 7)** - who is this person?

**Rory wearing the same outfit from the SH Gazette Still in Fall (Video 7)**

**Lorelai and Rory coming home in Winter(Video 7)** - The house looks so Christmas-y, I love it 

**30 year olds in Stars Hollow(Video 7)** - Bailey!

**Rory and Lorelai at the SH Gazette (Video 7)** - The Stars Hollow Gazette looking as messy as it did when Jess was there. Probably the same season.

**Rory and Lorelai at the pool (Video 7)** - Id be okay with a little less of Lorelai and Rory acting like divas And the kids have names - Brandon and Dewey. Dewey could be Sookies third kid, but at this rate it probably doesn't matter.

**Lorelai walking through a ton of streamers (Video 8)** 

**Rory looking very amused by a decorative floral display (Video 8)**

Have the recent interviews been making you feel like they are all pointing to single!Rory or are you still feeling like single is not an option?

Before we started hearing about the level of involvement of the actors I was thinking she could move on and I'd be totally happy, but it seems like an awful choice for them to include so much of Logan (who has no real place in Rory's world if she didn't want him there) just for them to break up in the final episode.

I thought I'd start a little list of things that point to Logan endgame vs. single!Rory, so maybe some of you guys can help me see the picture more clearly.

**Logan Endgame**

* Logan figures heavily ([X](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-wife-whats-next-cast-892173))
* Matt has read all four scripts ([X](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-wife-finale-satisfying-sexy-884670))
* We are seeing a steampunk event with Logan ([X](https://66.media.tumblr.com/25edf31bd772f47f2f09fcc91830fde9/tumblr_oelww3G1rF1rphksfo9_500.gif))

* IMDb lists two different episodes with tango related characters
* Tanc learned to golf (for Roadies or Gilmore Girls, but my money is on GG) ([X](http://imgur.com/GQROmQj))
* Robert has a scene at a B&amp;B ([X](https://emilydoesthething.tumblr.com/post/144013232180/inoubliableetoile-fuckyeahgilmore-interesting))
* They filmed a heart to heart scene with Logan and Robert about Rory ([X](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2fbd861ef0a814ba7f331ea8d7b4db8/tumblr_odlfv0FUBk1qk4p95o1_1280.png))
* Reports of sexual tension on set for Logan and Rory ([X](http://imgur.com/ZGeZzPf))
* Of course what we know about the [Winter AMA Spoilers](#s ""Rory sleeping with Logan in London"")
* Matt is doing postgame press. He's booked to do Live with Kelly on December 1
* Alexis said we will get an answer 
* We already got an ending with Rory ending things with Logan
* Matt Czuchry had a busy filming schedule, so including him wasn't the easiest
* Reviewer said ""which boy she ends up with"" ([X](http://junkee.com/gilmore-girls-revival-review-worth-watching/89791))
* ""I think the question is answered as to who wins Rory's heart"" - Alexis ([X](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04gvxvm?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_radio_4&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=radio_and_music))

**Single!Rory**

* Ausiello's educated guess on single endgame
* Liza Weil's Comments
* ASP might not care that season 7 already ended things on this note

**Ambiguous**

* Matt saying will we have a ""very, very special"" moment between them
* Critics are sworn to secrecy so they actually can't give anything away.



I know there are others but I can't recall or find them right now. Can you guys help me out?

I know I'm super biased, but to me their biggest issue in season 7 was timing, and now it seems like there shouldn't be any obstacles, and I'd really like to think ASP isn't going to jerk us around with her love life.

I've been in plenty of ship wars and usually I just check out, keep shipping whatever it is I ship (whether it's canon or not) and go about my life in a pretty standard way. Sometimes I do find myself getting swept up in shipping culture more than I would like, and the biggest ship war I've ever been in has been going on since 1997 when I was literally **five years old**. I am now **twenty-four** and that ship war is STILL going despite the fact that it's over canon-wise. 

I haven't been in the GG fandom for very long, but I feel as if the ship war in this fandom will continue to live on no matter what happens Nov. 25th. This is going to be my new Final Fantasy VII fandom and I just... don't know why this is a thing? Like, I feel like people just fight over ships because they're petty? Honestly, I don't even know how many of us want our ships to happen because we think it'd be the right choice or if it's just because we're all petty and wanna be like ""HAHA! I TOLD YOU!!"" in the end?

Anyway. I would like to know... 

- what your first ship war was

- whether it's still going 'til this day

- and how much of your desperation for whatever it is you ship in GG is based off of pettiness. 

**Warning: this thread requires some real ""introspection"" lmao**

FYI: I want Rory to wind up single w/ Jess left open as a future possibility.

My thoughts/questions:

* First off, is this a sanctioned LBD event, or is this Logan and his friends, who happened to be in the LDB, throwing a themed party? I'm starting to think this isn't an actual LBD event, especially because in 6x18 Colin said their trip to Costa Rica was the last LDB event for them. But if it isn't, then what could it be? A dream sequence? In one of the reviews (EW?) the critic says Fall starts off with two dream sequences, one was Cheryl Strand-Wild-esque (which accounts for Lorelai in the mountains) but could the other one be Rory's dream? Of course there is that half second image of Rory in a robe at a B&amp;B which alludes to maybe going with Logan to a party? Plus we know Finn is in Summer so that also points the the party being real and not a dream. 
 
* Is there a specific reasoning for the Steampunk theme? Is there a Twilight Episode tie-in? Is it because H.G. Wells and/or Jules Verne are some of Rory's favorite authors? Is it just symbolism of uniting the old with the new? Steampunk is the combination of Victorian era with modern technology. I could see the theme having to do with uniting Logan/Rory's old relationship both personal and professional (i.e. their college love and the written word) to Logan/Rory's new relationship both personal and professional (i.e. their adult love and the the written word moving to the digital world) 

* Do we think the party is in Stars Hollow or outside Stars Hollow?

* How does the Dragonfly pin on Logan's lapel fit in? That can NOT be a coincidence. Plus his outfit is way more formal than the other guys. It's tailor made and more like a victorian tux. 

* Is it possible that Rory orchestrates the party and asks for Logan's friend's help? How great would the parallels be that in ""You Jump, I Jump Jack"" Logan picked Rory's dress and it fit her perfectly because he had an eye for dress sizes and in Fall Rory picks Logan's costume and it fit perfectly because she knows his sizes.

* Is it been confirmed that Logan also took dance classes and does a dance? Or is it only Colin, Finn and Robert? What in the world could include a Tango dance? I know in some Steampunk balls they do tango dancing which would make it more likely that this was an LBD sanctioned event. 

SO MANY QUESTIONS???

So something that has always bothered me about Lauren as Lorelai, which is really just a petty gripe since she is very well cast, is the slight southern twang on certain words. After watching a couple of interviews with her along side Alexis it can often come out sounding stronger too and it got me thinking about it in the series.

I know it often happens that actors won't really re adjust themselves so long as they have enough of a general American accent but this one gets under my skin a lot since the character Lorelai grew up in Connecticut.

The words I notice it the most on are 'Time' and 'I', and to a lesser extent words that have that same long 'i' sound.

Seriously. After 10, you just stop counting. Recently discovered that one of my newest best friends is a huge fan (and another good friend is about to complete the series for the first time). THEN I discovered the subreddit. I (ignorantly) NEVER realised-until after having a few frustrating debates regarding plots and characters- that there are so many different opinions other than my own. (""Wait, some people actually like Chris??""). 

After multiple heated arguments and preparation for the revival, I finally rewatched the series from a completely objective point. Plenty of beliefs and judgements remain intact. [Nope. I still can't see how anyone can root for Logan. I'm Sorry.] But... it breaks my heart to announce....

I am formally renouncing my former status as being Team Jess. :(

Here's what I realised:
I was always Team Jess, because I myself was smitten with him. I've come to the conclusion that I wanted to live vicariously through Rory and be with him. There's a lot of hate for him on here, it's okay. And, after discussing him with a friend, she said she doesn't want Rory to end up with Jess, that ""Rory isn't good enough for him"". Maybe it's jealousy, or having never been the biggest Rory fan- but it hit me. I was like, ""yeah, she doesn't deserve him!""

After much contemplation (seriously, this has plagued me for months at work while pondering over it in my head), I have come to this conclusion: I think he's is right guy but was at the wrong time. Rory was always very self concious about what people thought about her, and at times could be self absorbed. He grounds her. He played a big part in helping her realise that she was throwing away all ambitions, and that she wasn't being herself (or who she could be). [When he comes to visit her at Yale and confronts her at her grandparent's house]. He is adventurous, exciting, ambitious, self-sufficient, intelligent, and enjoys the same  books and music as she did. I like that he was encouraging, motivating, and supportive of her dreams. I think they had an intellectual relationship in a different level than anyone she ever dated- which I think is one of the most important things to be with Rory (and especially to be with someone for the rest of their life).

Unfortunately, I think they screwed it up. There's to much poor history. Both were far too young and immature. Jess had all kinds of problems, Rory was too inexperienced and had to much going on with college. I think they are both passionate people together, and that chemistry will always be there- but I can't imagine him being single. (I mean, helloooo: look at him!) In the trailer they seem too amicable, like 2 casual friends meeting up.  If they had met as adults, i, without a doubt, know they'd be together.

**Season 2. Ep 10: The Bracebridge Dinner** *I just LOVE this episode. Jess jumping on the sleigh...Sookie losing her mind, Jackson in tights! This is an EXCELLENT episode to showcase the town dynamics* 

**Season 2. Ep 22: I Can't Get Started** *So lovely and sad. Sookie is SUCH a beautiful bride and effing Christopher...Jess's return and the election. Great recap episode.* 

**Season 3. Ep 4: One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes** *Lorelai pisses off the Stepford moms and Lane dyes her hair. Great scenes of Rory being mean/jelly.*

**Season 3. Ep 22: Those Are the Strings, Pinnochio** ~or~ **Season 3. Ep 17: A Tale of Poes and Fire** *Ok, you choose. You can't have a best of without Rory's graduation from Chilton. That speech...man, I cry every time. BUT, the rest of the episode is meh. I prefer the Poe episode. I'll watch the Poe episode, and Rory's speech.* 

**Season 4. Ep 2: The Lorelai's First Day at Yale** *Quintessential Ggs, the mattress that won't leave and the $4000 of take-out food. Copperboom!*

**Season 4 Ep 21: Last Week's Fights, This Weeks Tights** *This and the episode after are the BEGINNING of L&amp;L but this one has WALTZING and no extra-marital sex! This is one of my favorite episodes of all time.*

**Season 5. Ep 7: You Jump, I Jump, Jack** *Here we see the chaos and sparkle that is Logan. IN OMNEA!!*

**Season 5. Ep 13: Wedding Bell Blues** *This episode is hard to watch. How could Emily BE SO EVIL?! But, the dance, the song...We will love you forever, Richard.*

**Season 6. Ep 9: The Prodigal Daughter Returns** *The fight is over. The girls are themselves again. Emily loses her mind. Fun is had by all.* 

**Season 6. Ep 19: I Get a Sidekick Out of You** *LANE GETS MARRIED!! Lore makes the best drunken speech ever!*

**Season 7. Ep 4: S'Wonderful, S'Marvelous** *Lore and Chris have the best date ever....we're all grieving, but it's pretty damn sweet. Emily gets arrested!!*

**Season 7. Ep 22: Bon Voyage** *Maybe not the best episode, but def the ONE to watch before the revival. I well up when Richard says his peace to Lore at the party! Good bye, Rory!!*

So, that's my list. What would you do different? ",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Today I got let go from my job.  In 8 years of being a successful career woman, I have *never* been fired before.  And when I asked why, the response was that I didn't get high enough licensing (I work in finance).  Which is confusing since I got licensed 6 months ago.  So basically, the finance world version of ""You just don't have it.""  I'm devastated.  I really liked my job and this came out of nowhere.

I just wanted to take a moment and thank you all on this sub.  When I'm ever experiencing a difficult time, Gilmore has always been there to cheer me up and even moreso now that I have a community to celebrate it with.  Thank you for being there in your own way.  I sincerely appreciate it.

When it first came on, it was a peripheral fixture and occasional source of white noise when my teenage cousin would babysit. I got a little older, and a couple of my classmates had bit parts on two episodes, so I picked up watching from their episodes, but dropped off just as quickly, because my brain was 12 and still needed to decant before it could fully comprehend the references. Then, at 16, I watched (and immediately rewatched) the series in syndication with my mom and sister. Rinse and repeat dozens of times through college, five new apartments I needed to ""break in"" with GG, and the continuous life cycle of new friends and boyfriends that ""had"" to watch this show.

Through it all, I've always kind of liked, well-- everyone. Yes, there are character flaws that have been hashed and rehashed so often they're practically good for breakfast, but overall every character seemed fundamentally good. Specifically when it came to the boyfriends, since I've always loved how symmetrical their strengths and weakness are. Like, Dean is possessive, sure, but the opposite side of that coin is devotion. Both sort of the same quality manifested in different ways, the same way Jess is impulsive but spontaneous, and Logan can be smarmy but is usually charming. I've always leaned Jess personally, but I'd be reasonably happy with a Logan endgame (same would have gone for Luke/Chris for Lorelai if season 7 didn't play out the way it did).

Anyone else feel this way? I guess I just think that all the boyfriends are portrayed as exceptionally intelligent, attractive, and loving guys, and despite a few missteps that are easy to empathize with, they're all kind of catches.",12,20,False,self,,,,,

It made me think of Rory and her three big relationships. While things may not end the way I hope them to in the revival (less than a week till we find out) I found reading this made me smile. All credit goes to its author: Kate Rose of Words of Kate Rose. I thought that here on practically the eve of finding out the resolution to the long debated shipping wars, that this was a good read. It made me smile.



It's been said that we really only fall in love with three people in our lifetime. 

Yet, it's said that we need each of these loves for a different reason. 

Often our first is when we are young, high school even. It's the idealistic love; the one that seems like the fairytales we are all read as children. 

It's a love that looks right. 

The second is supposed to be our hard love; the one that teaches us lessons about who we are and how we often want or need to be loved.

Sometimes it's unhealthy, unbalanced or narcissistic even. 

It's the love that we wished was right.

And the third is the love we never see coming. The one that usually comes dressed as all wrong for us and that destroys any lingering ideals we clung to about what love is supposed to be. 

It's the love that just feels right. 

Maybe we don't all experience these loves in this lifetime; but perhaps that's just because we aren't ready to. 

Possibly maybe we need a whole lifetime to learn or maybe if we're lucky it only takes a few years. 

And there may be those people who fall in love once and find it passionately lasts until their last breath. 

Someone once told me they are the lucky ones; and perhaps they are.

But I kinda think that those who make it to their third love are really the lucky ones.

They are the ones who are tired of having to try and whose broken hearts lay beating in front of them wondering if there is just something inherently wrong with how they love. 

But there's not; it's just a matter of if someone loves in the same way that they do or not. 

And maybe there's something special about our first love, and something heartbreakingly unique about our second...but there's also just something about our third.

The one we never see coming.
The one that actually lasts.
The one that shows us why it never worked out before. 

And it's that possibility that makes trying again always worthwhile, because the truth is you never know when you'll stumble into love.

Now, don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the show and especially the dialogue and I honestly believe that when such lines were written is was not intended to be hateful or offensive, it was just an honest reflection of people's attitudes towards such issues 10+ years ago. I'm curious as to what we can expect from the revival in relation to changing times. I've seen ASP in interviews and she definitely does not seem like the type to hold back on jokes because they might offend, but I think she's aware of how large her fanbase is and how much press the show is and will be getting so I don't think she'll drop any major bombs, just some comments that people may read too much into or get sensitive about. What do you guys think? Do you think the show will avoid jokes about touchy subjects altogether or find a way to make them still funny and clever without stepping on toes?

Another aspect I'm curious about is all the pop culture references and how (if at all) that will play into who they mention and what they say. Because celebrities can react and respond almost instantly (like we saw with John Oliver and Amy Schummer when the teaser came out), would that affect anything? I can recall that they often remarked negatively and derisively on then-modern pop musicians and I'm curious too see if the instant feedback that they didn't have then will be a big thing now. Obviously, since they already wrote and filmed it, they're not gonna make changes if celebrities who are referenced negatively tweet them or something, but I'm just curious if that affected their writing at all.",4,6,False,self,,,,,

The way that the both of them handled the situation was piss fucking poor. Luke took way too long to tell Lorelai about it. I understand that he needed time to process but by the time that Lorelai found out about it, the idea had kind of begun to settle. He and April had begun meeting up and trying to make it a regular thing. He was past the point of digesting the information. Not to mention that he basically pushed Lorelai out of that part of his life. Until he needed Lore to help with the birthday party, he seemed like he was pretty intent to keep her away from April. When Lorelai asked him why (also in the birthday episode), his reasoning was that April would end up liking Lorelai better than him which is a pretty childish reason not to introduce your fiancee to your child.

Luke is not the only one at fault here though. Lorelai did not handle the situation either. When Luke told her that he wanted to postpone the wedding, she acted like sulky teenager. Instead of telling him about her feelings and that she *didn't* want to put the wedding off, she was extremely passive aggressive and basically voiced her feelings (that she felt like they would never get married) to literally everyone but Luke, including her *mother*, whom Lorelai never divulges anything to. She didn't communicate properly at all. 

There seems to be a lot of hate towards April about the breakup and, frankly, I'm a little sick of it. Come on, April is a twelve-year-old kid that just tracked down her father. It makes sense that she wants to spend time with him. She isn't really aware of the struggle between Luke/Lorelai at the time and is honestly just trying to get to know her father. It's not her fault. If Luke and Lorelai had been a little more mature and handled the situation differently, they wouldn't have split up. ",7,10,False,self,,,,,

It's a really lovely interview so if you have 10 minutes to spare, I highly encourage you to check it out. I was especially surprised to learn that ASP gave Alexis feminist books to read on set as ""homework"". The GG portion starts at the 11:15 mark.

Radio Interviewer: ""Alexis, fans I know are very keen to hear which ex-boyfriends will show up again. Apparently, I'm told, they call themselves Team Jess, Team Dean, or Team Logan. Who comes back?""

AB:  ""They all come back. They're all in the reunion episodes. I think the question is answered as to who wins Rorys heart. I hope fans find it satisfying, I dont know if its what people might expect, but I dont think thats what Amy likes to write. I think she likes to challenge peoples expectations a bit. It's very true to her so I think anyone who loves the show will hopefully get a thrill out of the outcome.""

Interviewer: ""And what about Luke, Lauren?""

LG: ""Well, I think its interesting on the one hand thats also been an open-ended question; will they end up together? But its beside the point in this show in that of course we want them to have resolution and love and companionship but number one they always have each other. And I also find how that story line is handled in this iteration of the show really satisfying. I think it even has to do with losing her dad- kind of makes her reassess everything and kind of challenges her to stand up for what she wants.

But really **at its core its a romance between mother and daughter more than it is between any of the men** and I think thats part of the show that were proud of.""

My thoughts:

I initially read Alexis' response as she makes a choice [on a guy] and I admit to being more focused on her response that I didn't really pay too much attention to Lauren's (I dismissed them as being rote interview answers), but listening to it in conjunction with Alexis' response got me thinking.

What if Rory's choice is her mom? Now hear me out. The one who wins her heart is Lorelai since the show, like Lauren says, is a romance between mother and daughter, what if in fall Rory turns Logan down because her heart will always be with Stars Hollow and Logan represents [to her] life beyond the Hollow. It would make sense in a way -- though a part of me will be sad because Rory [to me] has always been shown as wanting more than that small town life, but who knows what 9 years of globe-trotting can do to a girl? So maybe she realizes that her roots will always be in that small town, with her mom. So she lets Logan go. Takes over the Stars Hollow Gazette and lets the dust fall.

I guess what I'm trying to do here is come to terms with a possible single Rory ending, one that I can understand the reasoning behind. It's the unexpected outcome Alexis suggests because she chooses Lorelai in the end. It's very true to ASP; that the mother-daughter relationship will always be at the core more so than any men who come into their lives. And fans who get this concept will be thrilled by it? (Um, I guess, Alexis). It fits Matt's ""fans will have passionate discussions about the ending. I guarantee it."" It also fits his ""Logan and Rory have a very, very special ending"" she turns him down, and he accepts it because he recognizes that she doesn't need any man to complete her.

Or I may very well be trying to force the single Rory ending because the alternative means ALL MY DREAMS COME TRUE. And I really, really need to manage my hopes on this one.

I also really really remember reading an interview with ASP in maybe 2010/11? Where she said that Rory was ALWAYS going to end up with Jess. I can't find this anywhere online though :-( 
More than anything I just hope that Jess is happy with someone! It doesn't have to be Rory! I hate the idea of him being single and pining after Rory in these films. I hate the idea of Dean and Logan also being single and pining after her and Rory basically getting to pick!

1.Lorelai receiving the ice cream maker and telling Rory she needs to find the sender and return it because ""It's called closure hun, I need it"". You know who else probably wanted closure? The guy you dumped 3 days before the wedding and whom we're not sure you called to actually personally dump.

2.Emily gloating whenever Rory came to her. She ran away in S1 and Emily did everything she could to stop Lorelai from talking to Rory and keep Rory there as much as possible. Later, in S6 Rory once again leaves home and Emily supports that and gives her shelter. But hey, remember what she bitterly, self righteously and reproachfully said to Mia when she met her? Let's remember how that discussion went, shall we?

MIA: When Lorelai showed up on my porch that day with a tiny baby in her arms, I thought to myself, what if this were my daughter, and she was cold and scared and needed a place to live? What would I want for her? And then I thought, I'd want her to find somebody to take her in and make her safe and help her find her way.

EMILY: That's funny. **I would've wanted her to find someone who would send her home.** I have to go. 

I know Emily suffered a great deal when Lorelai left which is why it baffles me that she seems to wish the same upon her as often as she is given the chance.

3.Rory being all high and mighty and telling Paris how horrible she was for stringing Jamie along while also dating Asher. As if that hadn't been her a season ago.

4.Inspired by a comment below: Lorelai saying ""I've got the good kid"" in response to Paris having safe sex with her fairly long term exclusive boyfriend at 18-19 years old. Fast forward a year later: Lorelai's daughter is sleeping with a married guy. Oh yeah Lor, you've sure got the good kid!

I've been seeing a guy that happens to work at Yale (I'll omit his occupation, but suffice to say it would be very Rory approved). We've been on a few dates and this past week he asked me to dinner (pizza) and a show. I got to his place early and we had about an hour to kill before the band started so he decided to take me on a tour of campus, as I have never been to Yale before. At this point I decided it was a good idea to not mention that my knowledge of the Yale campus was strictly based on my GG obsession. So he showed me Old Campus, which I guess is all the freshman dorms, and then proceeds to take me via his access card to all these little buildings, dining halls, and libraries on campus, through courtyards, etc etc. It's a beautiful campus and I know they didn't film there but I think they did a good job making it look accurate. Anyway, he brought me into Sterling Memorial Library, which looks like a huge cathedral, and showed me all the beautiful leather bound books haha. He knows the library very well (wink wink, occupation hint), and brought me up to this nook in the back top corner that over looks a clock tower. He was showing me these hundreds year old volumes of newspaper reviews. The place just smelled like old books, yes I smelled the books, I pulled a Rory. So we're looking out this stained glass window onto the campus and he kisses me in front of it, (yes in front of the books, Lane). It was incredibly spontaneous and romantic and I was having swoopy swoony feelings mixed with weird GG related ones. Then he took me down to this little courtyard that was adorable and closed in by brick and ivy and iron gates and we sat on a bench and made out for a bit. On our way out of this courtyard and off campus we pass this statue and he tells me, ""I don't know why but all the students here rub this guy's
 toe"" which is when, suddenly forgetting that I'm keeping my GG obsession under wraps I blurt out, ""That's the statue of Theodore Woolsey, rubbing his toe is good luck"" ... boom cover blown because who the hell would know that. Anyway, yeah the rest of the date was great - had drinks and pizza and saw a band play but I figured if anyone would appreciate my GG circa seasons 4-7 date it would be this sub.

* Rory looking official at the SH Gazette
* Rory runs into Dean
* Sookies ten page scene 
* The front porch with Jess, Luke and Rory
* Rory at the B&amp;B
* The ballerinas, truck, and a fancy party 
* LDB stuff - probably included in the scene above, but no confirmation 
* Emily at the beach (Martha's Vineyard, maybe?)
* Jess and Luke at the diner
* Two dream sequences - one most likely Lorelai hiking, and the other could be one of the scenes above
* One week time jump


Am I missing anything else?

If there is a ring in Rory's hands at the B&amp;B does that mean a proposal has already happened? Is Rory wrapping things up at the gazette after she finds out she's going to be published?

Lorelai and Emily finally both trying to be friends. I hope that Lorelai will be sympathetic to Emily's pain and be able to be there for her like she never has been in the past. 

Rory doing something she loves. If that means working at the stars hollow gazette or traveling, so be it.

Here we go.. FYI I used ASP only - no S7.

* He has this off putting habit of leering forward 
* He gestures too much with his right hand. He seems to keep his hands in his pockets a lot to avoid it.
* He puts his arm around Rory/his other dates like he owns them
* He's dismissive of how hard Doyle and others are working on the paper, had to audition for their slots, yet he can waltz in and write whenever he wants.
* He doesn't care at all how much he stresses out Doyle as editor
* He doesn't take his education seriously, unlike Rory
* He purposefully hides that he has friends over playing Poker to manipulate her
* He calls her ""kiddo""
* He doesn't seem to care that she isn't having any fun at the poker game and doesn't care that she falls asleep
* He steamrolls Rory in disagreements, focusing on winning the debate through word play, rather than hear her side, forcing her to agree
* He falls asleep at the play
* He makes out with Rory while they're both on dates
* He gets jealous easily
* He bar hops and parties EVERY night
* He drinks too much- including alone and to cope when sad
* He responds to being upset by partying and drinking, avoiding his emotions
* He doesn't know Rory's birthday
* They have a shallow relationship- they never have any real conversation
* He tells Rory to blow things off (baptism, ""temporary, have a drink"") rather than listen to her or push her
* He never goes to Stars Hollow and never learns anything about Rory's past
* Paris doesn't like him
* He can't even remember Luke's name - he forgets people's names in general, or pretends to to show they aren't important to him
* He goes off on a dangerous stunt without planning and gets wasted before jumping out of an airplane
* Rory wants him to go to London because she knows he needs to grow up- she doesn't ask him to stay

Now of course.. I think a lot of these are weak- many are from early in their relationship, when he was trying to keep things casual, before he realized he loved her, or before his accident, which was a big wake up call for him.

Ugh. I tried my best and yet all I can think is that none of these are that bad, and most are things he can/did move past. He knew Rory was special from the beginning, he pushed her to be a better journalist, he adored her dorky good girl list-making thing, he fully committed to her and it was easy because he loved her so much, he saved the YDN with everything he was begrudgingly learning from his father, he realizes when he makes mistakes and apologizes, he never abandons her- he calls and check on her and thinks of her. After the plane accident they are so sweet together.

I just can't help thinking ASP wanted them together. She could have had Rory cheat with Jess and leave Logan. Instead she has Rory consider but refuse Jess and has Logan get in a life-changing accident that makes them both realize how much they love each other, support each other like family, and makes Logan take things more seriously. How do you go from that S6 ending back to Jess?

Also, small thing, but one thing that sticks out to me is that Dean makes a big fuss about having to go to a dance and wearing a tux. Jess also makes a fuss about wearing a tux and going to prom. Then Logan shows up in the morning of YJIJJ in a full tux. And he dances with her in WBB without any hesitation.

Whatever, I guess I'm ready to have ASP stomp all over my heart on Friday morning. I just hate that she can't see the characters SHE wrote the way I do! Logan isn't Christopher! Why do they all keep saying that! It's super creepy to have Lor/Luke/Jess/Rory, and way to insular for a girl who longed her whole life to travel the world!

I tried.

okay now I can stop freaking out lol. Anyways I decided to list down some of the strong points of Logan that might potentially indicate that Rory and Logan are endgame (I hope, dear god I hope, that it will happen).
okay so here goes :
1. Whether or not the fans of the show think that Logan was the right guy for Rory or not, no one can argue that he was probably one of the most well developed characters on the show. Though out seasons 5-7, Logan grew up so much as a person and made adult decisions and was so incredibly dedicated with Rory.Even when he didn't make all the right choices he always owned up to his mistakes and shortcomings like he should have. I feel confident that he has grown up even more in the revival and I hope Rory takes that into consideration.
2. HE STILL LOVES RORY EVEN AFTER 10 YEARS HAVE PASSED *SWOON*. I honestly wasn't surprised by this when I found out that this was the case. Rory was the first significant romantic relationship he ever had, and that made a huge impact on him. He was so deeply in love with her and I honestly find it so sweet that no one could compare to her even after all these years.
3. ASP always had a strong love for Logan/Matt. ASP absolutely loves Matt as a person, and I feel that bias most probably factored in when she decided who was endgame. ASP also stated in interviews in the past that if the show had continued, Matt would have always been a part of it, which means that she feels that Rogan could have worked out long term. 
4. I know this has already been said a million times now, but Matt is in all four episodes. Why would a significant love interest be featured in all four episodes if there wasn't any potential there? I know that Milo is in three episodes, but from the promos we have seen so far their relationship seem purely platonic/friendly. Plus Jess and Rory will always be connected and in each others lives because of Lorelei and Luke. 

 I honestly hate the fact that  Rory and Logan seem to be in a casual relationship ( spoilers from winter episode). If the whole casual, stringless fun thing didn't work the first time around what makes Rory think it will work a second time, especially when they were in such a long, deeply committed relationship before??? I would hate for Logan's beautiful heart to get broken AGAIN by the girl who he always envisioned spending the rest of his life with. I just can't deal anymore *sigh*",31,5,False,self,,,,,

But, then I decided to rewatch a sampling of episodes before this big ""revival"" they say is happening...next Friday is it? Not that any of you would have heard of it. They're keeping it pretty low key...  ;)

And I decided to watch the end of season 4, when Lorelai is opening up the Dragonfly (because I love to see her accomplish her dreams, it just makes me happy). Episode 20 comes along, Lorelai shows up at the diner before dawn wanting coffee and she's telling Luke about how stressed she is and how much she has on her plate when he says ""I'm making you oatmeal."" And that's it. That's why these two work for me. Christopher is fun (and cute!) but Luke takes care of Lorelai. He shows up with food at the hospital when her dad is ill, he builds her a chuppah when she's planning to get married, he loans her money when she's desperately trying to open her own inn, he builds her an ice-rink when she starts to hate snow, and when she's exhausted and stressed and at her wits end, he makes her eat oatmeal. 

I think in a lot of ways, she's still very young, stuck at 16 somehow. And unfortunately, so is Chris. That means they can have a ton of fun together, and be kids. But that also means that when push comes to shove, he can't be there for her. Instead of supporting her, he relies on her to be the grown up when things get tough. But Luke is a grown up, always. So Lorelai can rely on him. She can be a kid and lighthearted and know that if she stumbles, he'll catch her. If things get dark, she can count on him to be the adult she needs. She can count on him to make oatmeal.

- Here by Alessia Cara (*""I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering / and i'm done talking, awfully sad it had to be that way / so tell my people when they're ready that i'm ready / and i'm standing by the TV with my beanie low / yo, I'll be over here""*)

I found out about the show in spring and it became part of my daily routine in order to finish all seven seasons before the Netflix special airs.

I was so happy that I finally made it just in time for the revival, but immediately I realized how much I will miss the old series. As great as the revival might be, it will feel totally different as the previous seasons felt. 
I don't really like that we only get four long episodes, because I'm scared that there will be no time to develop a real storyline and the whole revival will feel like nothing more than fan service. However, I'm still pretty excited.

Those last days until we finally get Stars Hollow back already feel pretty long and I can't imagine how people were able to wait eight years for this. It must have been a terrible long time.
I already found myself browsing YouTube for GG-related stuff last night to entertain myself with as much extra content as possible until Friday.

What I really want to add about the original show is that I loved the final season. I liked almost every storyline and thought the writers did a really good job, since Amy wasn't on the show anymore. I don't understand why everybody dislikes it so much. So, while I loved season 7, I hated season 6. Nothing felt right, the fight between Rory and Lorelai was way too long and while I don't dislike April's storyline so much, it still wasn't a very good one either.

I don't really know which season I liked best, because each season had its own special moments/episodes, even season 6. My favourite moment from the whole show is Rory's speech when she graduates from Chilton. It was just so heartwarming.

Gilmore Girls is a truly special tv show, so different from all the other shows. I know it sounds stupid, but when I watch interviews with Lauren and Alexis, I never see them as the actors from Gilmore Girls. No, I see them as the Gilmore Girls. The Gilmore Girls are real. Stars Hollow is real. At least it feels like that :D

I ended up writing way more than I intended, just because I got so caught up in all the feelings I have after watching the final episode. Probably nobody even reads this, but I just had to share my feelings.

I found this new article and since I can speak portuguese, I'm going to translate some lines of this article with informations I thought could be important. If you guys have any questions about the translation, please tell me.


&gt;**Despite being averse to major twist and turns plot,** the new scripts don't cower and offer characters like Paris (Liza Weil), Michel (Yanic Truesdale) and even Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) an active position in history, not simply decorative.


I think that information completely runs out the possibility of the ""bait and switch"" storyline. It is what it is. Probably no HUGE gesters and Big No.


&gt;There is a great consistency in the way they tell the stories of Emily and Lorelai, and all this evolution could be absolutely perfect if it weren't for **the dubious way which Sherman-Palladino deals with one of Rory's men of the past.**


I think they are talking about Logan.
So what you guys think? Let the speculations begin.

In the words of the 90s singing sensation, Dido, ""I will go down with this ship."" 

What I've discovered is by analyzing sentence structures, deciphering which ""team"" a reviewer is on, looking up most common definition of words (this was all me but whatever), can pull anyone to whichever team they want to believe is going to ""win."" 

This is what I know and believe. I think Logan has always been the best fit for Rory. I think Rory is keeping him at arms length because she is scared of settling down and doesn't know what she wants. I think their arc is going to be romantic, frustrating, beautiful and satisfying. I think Rory's big decision is to determine whether Logan fits into the life she wants for herself. I think Logan will try and make her see that he does.  I think ASP meant it when she said she could see them long term and married for 50 years if they ever got their shit together.  I don't think Alexis is manipulating her words when she says  someone will ""win"" her heart and we will get a definitive answer on the teams. I don't think Matt is leading us on with his ""very very special"" ending. 

I think Jess' main arc with Rory is mostly career driven. I think he will help her to not be afraid of what she wants, even if it's to stay in Stars Hollow working at a local paper. I think there will be sexual/romantic undertones as is always inevitable when you put these two together, especially because it is always simmering underneath the surface and was never resolved. However, I think ASP meant it when she said, ""You and me?..It is what it is."" meaning they will always have a deep connection, he will probably always know her better than anyone else, but romance may not be what is best for them. I think Milo meant it when he said he comes into town to move people forward and guide them. I think Milo also meant it when he said to lower expectations on his storyline and to enjoy the ride. 

I think Dean will be one throw away scene that is basically a cameo. I think you'll learn he is happily married, settled and at peace. I think he will come out of their run-in satisfied that Rory was too complicated for him. 

I think overall I am going to be elated come Friday that I will know the answer once and for all.

I think that'll do pig. That'll do.

And, like Rory, I grew up hearing how angelic and perfect I was because, unlike the other adults' teenagers, I wasn't out at all hours or drinking or getting caught with boys, and I spent so much time on my studies. I was brilliant, they said. So smart. 

Well, the thing is, now in my mid-20s, I have a very different idea of what ""brilliant"" means. Growing up, I assumed it was getting A's and loving school and reading a lot. Much like Rory believes. Now that I'm older and I've seen more of the world and met/read about more people, my idea of ""brilliant"" is a lot different. I think about people my age or younger conducting research, discovering theorems, inventing things, making huge differences in the world in some way. Sure, I'm intelligent, as is Rory, but am I brilliant? I don't really think so anymore. I think brilliant and intelligent are different. 

I wonder if Rory will think that, as well. Will she have realized that doing well in school and reading a lot does not a genius make? Will she be reevaluating her life and her career based on that, as some of the trailers seem to indicate? I'm really interested in seeing how she views her own mind and place in the world now.

So I'm new here, and I may be reiterating thoughts you've heard before, but I've seen a fair few comments wondering about the appeal of Jess.

Full disclosure: 30 something dude, watched GG 3 times with fianc over the past 2 years.

So, for starts: I never cared much for Immature Jess. He had a giant chip on his shoulder, and didn't know his place in the world. He was definitely  wrong to pressure Rory as hard as he did, and the taunting of Dean was unnecessary.

I did enjoy him slowly working out his place in the world though. He is a creative type, and I think the publishing house was a perfect place for him to mature, and find his own voice.

I think Jess at his best encourages Rory to hear her own voice, and urges her to be true to her own heart. I think his creative expression could help inspire her own. Now, I don't think we really saw him earn his claim of ""knowing her better than anybody,"" but I think he does remind her that she knows herself, and what she wants out of life.

I don't necessarily think that they will be (or should be) together, but I think he is good at pushing her to figure things out for herself.

Alrighty, that's all! Thanks if you made it to here!

TLDR: I like Jess because I feel he's a creative type, and I think that is an aspect of Rory that he has a way of pulling out, or something.",30,19,False,self,,,,,

Any other moments like this that I missed?

Dance/Tux:

* Dean: (Chilton dance and coming out party) - HATES the tux, has to be bribed, doesn't want to dance.
* Jess: Doesn't want to go to prom, Rory knows he doesn't like it or the tux, but he is willing to do it for her. Makes a cute joke about the tux instead of being a child like Dean.
* Logan: Shows up outside her tent in a tux. She asks him to dance in WBB and he does without even a hint of complaint.


Dinner with Grandparents:

* Dean: You want me to go? Then I'll go - no major negotiation needed. Shows up and is nice but Richard is a jerk.
* Jess: HATES the idea of going, has to be talked into it by Luke. Shows up and tries to be somewhat nice but has a black eye and him and Rory fight
* Logan: Doesn't really want to go, but happy enough to do it. Pulls one stupid prank but the grandparents LOVE him. Lorelai feels left behind all evening.

Rory's Writing:

* Dean: ""I thought it was good.""
* Jess: Does this ever happen? Drawing a blank.
* Logan: ""Caught the spirit of the thing, I'll give you that."" and ""You've got a good style. There were a few too many similes in it for my taste, but it definitely had a Joseph Mitchell thing going for it, I like that.""


Pushing Rory to adventure:

* Dean never does this because he is boring.
* Jess: Gets Rory to skip studying and get ice cream.
* Logan: Takes her to NYC on a whim, she is always ready to go along with him.

Also...

&gt;JESS: Come with me.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Where?
&gt;
&gt;JESS: I don't know...away!

&gt;
&gt;JESS: It is. I know you.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: You don't know me!
&gt;
&gt;JESS: Look, we'll go to New York. We'll work, we'll live together, we'll be together. It's what I want. It's what you want, too.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: No!

vs.

&gt;LOGAN: Come on, you look like you need a little adventure.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: What does that mean?
&gt;
&gt;LOGAN: Youre just a little sheltered.
&gt;
&gt;RORY: Why? Because I havent spent time in a Nazi prison, been stomped on by hooligans and beat up by Hells Angels? And Plimpton got banged up pretty good too.
&gt;
&gt;LOGAN: Itll be fun, itll be a thrill. Something stupid, something bad for you. Just something different. (Rory smiles.) Isnt this the point of being young? Its your choice, Ace. People can live a hundred years without really living for a minute. You climb up here with me, its one less minute you havent lived.

I've only managed two seasons. Ah well, I'll keep binging after this weekend and then probably watch the new eps AGAIN after Season 7. Anyway, onto my thoughts.

- This season is funny. Really, laugh out loud funny.

- To that purpose, RORY is funny. She's even, dare I say it, a little goofy. Alexis really loosens up this season, her acting is probably the most expressive out of all the seasons (I think she gets a little stiffer later on). She actually has some good comedy chops, but GG always seemed to like to push her into the drama side, the straight man to Lorelai's comedy act. 

- I'm trying to remain impartial and not go all team Jess on you but MAN OH MAN DO JESS AND RORY HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY. I know it's mostly to do with them being together in real life but the flirty looks and their body language is just off the chain. Makes poor Dean look like lumpy mashed potatoes in comparison. There's this bit where Dean and Rory are kissing by a tree and they are standing in weird positions and their kissing is passionless and it's SO AWKWARD.

- I do actually think Dean and Rory are quite sweet in the first few episodes though. But you can tell from the first episode or so that Rory's not that into him anymore.

- Paris and Brad scenes give me life. I don't think I've laughed so hard in a long time. 

- I completely forgot about that episode Sherry comes to Stars Hollow. Like, I've watched GG countless times and it must be one I've skipped over on re-watches because the only part I remembered was the Chris/Lorelai fight but even that was hazy. 

- Lorelai goes from lovably flawed to obnoxiously self-centered. We've known she's selfish since season 1 but it was always tempered with  her accepting she's wrong so we forgive her for it. She doesn't really do that this season, she's quite bull-headed- and I find it harder to sympathise with her. 

- Luke and Lorelai's chemistry is still there but it's toned down from the insane amount we

- Christopher and Sherry were not broken up. Christopher mentions they had a talk and couldn't decide what to do and so Sherry went away and he too had a think and was thinking that it probably wasn't going to work. Lorelai even says to Rory that Chris and Sherry are in the process of breaking up, not that they ARE broken up. Very much like what happens two seasons later with Rory. 

-  There are some fantastic Emily and Lorelai scenes this season, just terrific. 

- As are Luke/Jess scenes. 

- Paris and Jess, both of whom don't warm to other people but both like Rory, immediately get on. I'd have love to see more scenes with them. Not in a romantic sense, more in a friends way. I thought it was very interesting they had respect for each other and were comfortable in each other's company straight away. 

- Richard is a difficult character this season. I think they do it well and give us a good reason for it (his retirement and emotional turmoil about his place in the world) but he does drive me mad at times. 

- I know Rory is raked over the coals for the way she treats Dean but I actually give her a lot of leeway in this season. We as viewers can see it outright but she is honestly oblivious, as many of us are when it comes to being self-aware of our own feelings. Maybe if she looked deep down she'd know but I think she honestly thinks that she just wants to be friends with Jess.  ",4,9,False,self,,,,,

Then when she gets the job in season seven (the one she turns down in hopes for the NYT fellowship) she talks about how its a ""real writing job"" like its something she never had before. 

This just really bothers me... is it ever explained or just, dropped?

The other thing that bothers me, having been an editor of a college newspaper (a weekly, not even a daily), there's no way she would have had as much free time as she did, taking extra coursework to make up her lost semester, and be EIC.

I had a fairly intense discussion couple of days ago with my wife and my mother-in-law. I'll present my entire argument and whoever wants to can tell me why I'm wrong. Spoilers for Season 6. 

We were watching the Gilmore the Merrier marathon on Up, when they were up to Season 3, and during one of the Lorelei/Luke will-they-won't they moments, I said something like ""C'mon, guys, get together. And never cheat on each other."" This was met with ""She never cheated on Luke!"" The basic disagreement is that they say that Lorelei ends the relationship and then sleeps with Christopher in order to make sure that Luke won't try to win her back (hence, not a cheat), whereas I think that she sleeps with Christopher specifically to end the relationship (hence, cheating). 

The conversation really got heated when I compared the situation to Logan. ""Well, did Logan cheat?"" They said, ""Yes."" This strikes me as a contradiction. Logan, if we believe him, ends his relationship with Rory without making it totally clear to her that it's over. Lorelei offers Luke an ultimatum, who does his usual Luke thing and says he needs time to think, rather than confront the problem head on. Lorelei says she has to go. To me, it isn't necessarily clear to Luke that it's over (remember Rory's line ""You can't just decide that you're broken up and go off and...""). There is a look on Luke's face that suggests he knows that things are in bad shape, but not necessarily OVER. Her motivations are different, but her decision is total Huntsberger.

The one justification I kept hearing was that, because the motivations are different, the decisions are too. This actually makes Lorelei seem worse. Logan cheats on Rory because he is only thinking about himself. Lorelei cheats on Luke because she wants to hurt him. 

My big thing is just that, in picking a side, the choices are to be on Rory/Luke's side, or to be on Lorelei/Logan's side, at least where Cheating Parameters are concerned. Lorelei is, of course, a much better person than Logan, and has complex feelings regarding Luke and Chris, whereas this Logan situation is another in a long line of stories Logan tells to make himself the hero in his own life. There is nothing that says we can't still like Lorelei while considering her a... yknow... cheater.

Spoilers are fine except for winter AMA stuff, so please use spoiler formatting. 

Mine are going to err on the side wishes, but I think it's more fun that way. 

* Emily is going to buy a house at Martha's Vineyard 
* Rory is going to publish a book
* Lorelai is going to buy a new inn
* Finn owns/runs a tango club
* Lane is going to take over the music shop
* Logan is going to take his dad's place in the company
* Jess is going to be focused on publishing more than writing
* Lorelai decides to adopt
* the first snow is the final scene
* Rory decides to move to London

Feel free to share yours for eternal bragging rights after we've watched the whole series through.

I have to say that I get they (amy and Dan) wanted to please everyone.  But did they have to make it so rory ends up pregnant and alone at 32? I would have be ok with logan.  Our jess.  Or happily single. But we got an ending that no one can really be satisfied with. Rory just doesn't seem happy, and it sucks that is what we are left with.  

 Was that too much to ask for?  It's gilmore girls, not the sopranos. I dont want open ended.  I want resolution.  We got resolution for emily and Lorelei, the other gilmore girls.  But none for rory. And that's just not fair.  Unless they are giving us more, to not end her journey, or at least have her in a place where she is ok, just sucks.  

I just feel like, instead of sticking to what she wanted for season 7 (much of which  doesn't make sense 10 year later) was a bad decision.

There was a lot of hype built over these episodes, and I can't find myself liking any of them. How did a smart, ambitious young lady from Yale turn into a bohemian floozy? Let's take Rory from season 1 and compare her to the woman in the revival: is there any honesty, integrity, determination to refrain from being Lorelai left? What good was that Yale education? And don't get me started on what they did with Paris and Doyle. What was that?

Here's my list of what they should have done instead. Feel free to add yours.

* Kept Paris and Doyle together. Paris should have been a surgeon like she wanted, and Doyle may want a creative hobby, which Paris can give him grief about and Doyle can bring up her ""hot gluing bead after bead"" when she lost her spot as editor.

* Luke and Lorelai MARRIED at the beginning of the series, with the loss of Richard being something he would have to cope with as well. Maybe Richard and Luke had established a good relationship, with Luke now trying to figure out how best to care for Lorelai and Emily (ie be the new man of the house, like Richard was)

* Rory NOT cheating on Paul, and not helping Logan cheat on Odette. Seriously, what happened? Was ASP's goal always ""let's turn Rory into a serial cheater?"" She cheated on Dean with Jess, then cheated with Dean on Lindsey, then got upset when Logan slept with people during their breakup, then tried and failed to cheat on him with Jess, and now cheated on Paul with Logan/ with Logan on Odette. Lady... who are you and what did you do with Rory Gilmore? This went with a quirky sweet show to a PG version of reality TV; the only thing left is a Jerry Springer episode of ""who's the baby daddy?""

* Logan and Jess should have copied Dean and moved on with their lives. Honestly, who would have thought Dean turned out to be ""most stable"" of the lot? Rory is a nice looking girl, but she's not the only nice-looking girl, and her charm isn't unique. How did a reformed billionaire hedonist and a reformed bad boy turned author not manage to find another quirky brunette with no real career but lots of dreams? I used to be Team Logan, but honestly, I think Logan should run and take Jess with him. Hell, I'd rather see them as a couple now instead of either with Rory.

I started watching the moment it released, at 2 am my time. I went all the way through and finished at roughly 8:30 am. I was so excited to come here and discuss it only to find that 90% of the people on this subreddit hated it.

The more I read the more it seems like after all this time, everyone had their own version of the show in their head. Their own version of the characters. And those same people were disappointed that the characters didn't act the way their version of the character would.

If anything, the revival showed me that the OS didn't just have bad writing. It wasn't a lapse in judgement that our ""heroines"" were really shitty people. The writers didn't just occasionally forget what had happened in earlier seasons.

Everyone who thought that Rory was this infallible force of nature that was destined for greatness clearly missed the point of the OS. Rory is a shitty person. Rory has always been a shitty person, since the second season if not earlier.

The difference is that before, everyone was so invested in Team Dean, Team Jess, Team Logan, Team Rory, Team Lorelai, Team Whatthefuckever, that nobody noticed that Rory almost *never* made the right choice.

Suddenly, Rory being a serial cheater isn't something you have to connect the dots for. It's in your face now, it can't be denied. You think this is new? She cheated in every relationship in the OS.

And of course, *Why is Rory not a super successful Mary Sue?*

In the OS, we see time and time again that Rory cannot fail. Even when she's wrong (which is most of the time), everything works out in her favor.

The revival is the only time we've seen her really fail. Things didn't work out perfectly. She didn't get what she wanted. Her past mistakes finally caught up to her. And of course, everyone's upset about it.

These things happen. She majored in journalism and you can't understand why she can't get a job in 2016?

What I don't understand is what everyone was expecting. Because honestly, nothing in the revival is that unbelievable. Did everyone want her to once again have everything go her way, where we could see her have her NYT job and get her Team [Insert Your Team Here] perfect boyfriend? Man that sure would have been interesting.

It seems like half the people here got so invested in their own story lines you forgot that you didn't actually write any of it.

Some of you have probably seen me around this subreddit (admittedly not lately, as I was avoiding spoilers). I more or less called the major plot points for the revival months ago. How? Because the writing is on the wall and it always has been. If you chose to ignore that Rory is a shitty person, it's your fault you're disappointed in her. If you chose to ignore that Lorelai never really grew up, it's your fault for being disappointed in her.

Overall I really enjoyed it. I am a bit annoyed with how they left Rory and Logan and the whole cheating thing but i'm trying not to let that cloud the whole revival experience.

So I was thinking it would be really interesting to see what everyone thinks happened after the closing credits for Fall began to roll?

Personally I like to think that Rory would tell Logan about the baby, sooner rather than later. I think it would be so heartless of her to not let him know. If he found out I 100% think he would be delighted and would settle down with Rory for good and they would both be pretty happy.  If she didn't tell him, I can imagine Emily telling someone in her (ex?) social circle that Rory was pregnant and it would get back to Logan that way. I hate to think of him finding out that way.

I love the idea of the dream team of Lorelai, Sookie and Michel back together and turning the nun's house into a spa. It felt right to see Sookie back in the kitchen again.

I've never been the biggest Jess fan but I really liked him in the revival and wished he had played a bigger role. I'd like to see him move on from Rory once and for all cause I honestly think he deserves to be so happy and he'll never be that if he's still hung up on her.

I do think this is how ""heirs"" actually face their destiny, but why bother bring him back, spend an absurdity in budget just to make his relationship with Rory so painful?

Logan was very truthful before when he didn't want to commit with anyone, but now he ""has"" a wife and will continue to not be commited, he will probably cheat on her forever as a rejection's tool and never love her. The whole cheating with Rory it's a clear proof that he is actually a rich, but miserable and dead inside incapable of doing what he really wants.

Logan has been said the replica of Chris and it seems Logan would be filling that role now. And Since Logan is sticking with ""dynastic Plan"" I bet hell will broke loose between the Gilmores and Huntzberger and boy nothing would fit with the two. And then there it was the glance jess gave. He will be the Luke in Rorys life I bet. The glance gave it away. Jess would be the guy who will give Rory the home feeling and would be fully connected. 


Though with everything seems laid out, it will be a tough battle between Jess and Logan. Logan may be getting the role of Chris but his character is way much better and her connection with Rory is much deeper than he was with Lorelai. And Jess, he didnt much have lot of backstory in the revival, it feels like he popped in, gave some advice and suddenly rekindle his feeling. Oh damn too much drama. I cant wait for another Revival!

I figured I probably missed a bunch because I definitely missed some in the original series until others pointed them out. So here's a thread to discuss/point out any running gags from the revival.

-Old: Lorelai needed a pen in the rehearsal of the Stars Hollow musical, and borrowed Andrew's

-New: the ladders that the maid's family kept carrying around. The first time I noticed them was when Lorelai came over during Emily's Marie Kondo breakdown. That seemed to make sense (I guess) but then the maid (sorry, I'm pulling an Emily here and absolutely cannot remember her name) was talking to Lorelai in one of the episodes and said something like ""my cousins came to visit and they brought their own ladders!"" And then they were carrying ladders around at Emily's place in Nantucket and at that point I realized it was just nonsense and couldn't stop laughing.

But could Rory's only scene with Christopher give us our answer?  

Rory asks Christopher about his decision to let Lorelai raise her alone. He says it was the way it was meant to happen, and she agrees, if somewhat halfheartedly. We assume that Rory's asking for her book, but she seems pretty upset, or at least pretty bemused, for someone who's just doing her research. 

What if Rory was asking Christopher because she A) knew she was pregnant by that point and B) knew Logan, an engaged man, is the father? If Logan is the father, that means he's likely unavailable to be in their child's life, since he'll be married to another woman. That, of course, leaves Rory as a single parent, just like her mom. Perhaps she was talking to Christopher to get reassurance that doing what Lorelai did would also be a right and good thing in her circumstances.  

Of course, you could apply this theory to Paul or even Jess, too - Rory and Lorelai agree that Paul doesn't ""fit"", and while we have no proof that anything happened between Rory and Jess in the revival, Jess's long, lingering look sure makes me wonder. So maybe it's that Rory *wants* to be a single mom regardless of the father - because she knows she's not in a place her life to settle down?  

Your guess is as good as mine, but I do think it's food for thought. The cardinal rule of writing TV is that you never include something that doesn't carry weight in the plot - so why did Christopher and Rory's scene feel so heavy? Maybe this is why.",3,4,False,self,,,,,

The older I get the less I wonder whether I'm a Rory or a Lorelai and the more I'm like ""YAS Emily!"" 

She was stunning, classy and graceful in these four episodes and I loved seeing her story arc play out. We know that Lauren Graham had to basically carry all the scenes she was in with Alexis because unfortunately the latter can't act for the life of her, but really, Kelly Bishop is the at times unsung hero of this show. Give her all the awards now!

Reasons I love Emily Gilmore then and now:

I've always greatly admired Emily and Richard's marriage. They were a team and despite their one separation, they knew that this was it. This was for life. They accepted each other's quirks and found ways to be supportive of each other while also giving each other space to pursue their respective goals and endeavours of choice. 

I love that after the complex relationship between her and Lorelai, Emily got to care for Berta and her family and show her caring side and have this care be accepted by someone. She got to experience 'family' again after Richard's passing while still being an independent woman. 

At first I was wondering about the significance of the Nantucket Whaling museum and I loved the reveal. Also, she was asserting her independence by going there herself - and securing a job while she was at it! - after Jack Smith wasn't able to take her. Emily Gilmore don't need no man to accompany her to the museum! 

That scene of her sitting on the little white bench at the end was the most *romantic* moment for me in this whole revival. It shows life goes on even in the midst of big loss and big grief. A woman whose existence was largely defined by being a 'wife' and a DAR board member is suddenly coming into her own once again and I'm here for it!

So why did everyone drink alcohol at every turn in the revival? Jess comes to visit - open the bourbon, let's have a picnic - open the bubbly, I'm angry with you - pour a snifter of 10 year old scotch, I'm selling my house - have some whisky, meet my new boyfriend - have a gimlet. Is it just me, or are Emily, Lorelei and Rory closet alcoholics? They had some sort of alcohol in hand in virtually every scene. 


Also, I really hope Rory's kid doesn't turn out like her -  a manipulative woman who takes advantage of the men in her life and refuses to take responsibility for her own actions. I've disliked Rory since season 3 when she fell for Jess and didn't have the courage to admit that she didn't like Dean anymore. The way she strung him along was disgusting, and she deserved the public breakup at the dance. I hope that she one day has an epiphany and begins to treat people decently, but I'm not holding out hope.

This is my explanation for how Rory Logan got to be where they are now(FWB) and parents by the end of Fall episode. Season 7 didn't happen, at least for Rory and Logan. They had drifted apart while he was in London and broken up. Rory went into the real world full of aspirations and couldn't live up to her dreams. Being frustrated both personally and professionally, she seeks out Logan who was engaged by then. Because she knew Logan is the kind of guy who can make you forget who you are, who can create a dream world just for you(Wow LDB scenes are amazing)


So Rory in order to protect herself from potential heart break as well as her being lost professionally and also the fact that Logan loves his job and is good at it. So she proposes a no-strings relationship, which Logan grudgingly accepts, because he believes that whatever he offers to her will never be enough, she is her own person(This shows Logan maturity in revival) and is afraid of the choice between his career/family obligation and love. He is afraid that with one wrong move he will lost both his career and love.(This is one different thing from what happened with Christopher, he lost both).


So he let's Rory be the decision maker(as can be seen in the final seen with LDB guys) in their relationship. Because he is the one who loves Rory more than she of him, he just wants her to be happy with whatever she chooses and also kind of internally feels that she could lose her sense of individuality if his family is involved and also knows that she doesn't belong to his world. I saw close parallels when Luke told he let's Lorelai do whatever she wants, accepting as her own person, accepting whatever she tells of their relationship.


So they say their final goodbye in New Hampshire and bam! Rory is pregnant with Logan's child. Now everything is messed up. All bet's are off.
I guess now it is upto Rory to decide what to do with the child. Of course it is close parallel with Lorelai, but Rory and Lorelai are so different people. I also kind of got the vibes in the end that Rory is planning to leave Stars Hollow forever.


She will have make her own decision on whether to let Logan in or not based on the past, not repeating the same mistakes again. I hope she tells Logan and moves to London. They won't be together but she wants her child to have a father, which she lacked during her own childhood, if she doesn't intend to repeat the same mistake again.",11,4,False,self,,,,,

We assume that Michel stayed, which makes me happy. We assume that Rory is Amy Paladino? Maybe not, but the main thing I'd like to think about is the final four words. TURN BACK NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED YET! 

Rory is pregnant. Now, we have to ask 2 questions. Who is the father and what does this mean for the series.

I don't think that Rory had sex with anyone except for Logan in this show. So, good for team Logan, right? Wrong. Logan is getting married, and I believe that Rory will play as a single mother, just like Lorelei. But maybe not. Did you see how Jess looked at Rory through the window at the end of fall? I firmly believe it will happen between them. 

Now what does this mean for the series? It could mean everything, and it could mean nothing. It could lead to a repurposed version of the show, a Gilmore Girls literal next generation. Maybe it will be the same type of thing as this Netflix thing. Will we have to wait 16 years? Fucking hope not. Maybe it won't happen at all, but I believe it will.

* Anything Jess, essentially. Maybe an actual plot worthy of Milo Ventimiglia, not just pining over his highschool girlfriend and lugging around a huge travel tote.
* Meeting Odette and learning more about her. It didn't feel right that Rory completely ignored the fact that Logan had a fiance and, in fact, threw a bit of a fit when she learned that said fiance would be around at his apartment. Whoa, shocker.
* Seeing Paris interact with her kids more. I love that she managed to combine her two loves - the medical field and the law - into a kickass career, but I would've loved to see her at home more. Make dinner, have conversations with her kids, not just play hostess to Rory and assess strangers' junk, essentially.
* Anything Emily Gilmore, that goes without saying.
* I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Emily interact with Kirk and I think there could've been more random/fun pairings for short conversations like, for example, Michel and Jess, Paris and Lane, Taylor and Paris, Gypsy and Berta (kidding) etc.
* How about seeing Lorelai tell Michel that she/they will be expanding after all. There was such a huge season-long build up and then we don't even see his reaction? (I know the timeline doesn't work out for this, but I'm sure it could've been done)
* A scene between Rory's former love interests. Maybe not so much Logan, but how about Jess and Dean randomly bumping into each other and finally making peace with the past?
* Honestly, I would've been fine just listening to Miss Cline talk about movie stars of the fourties for a while in lieu of the musical.

I was so blindsided I am still in shock with that ending. So OOC it's alarming. It's like ASP finally took revenge for the contract dispute eleven hundred years ago. Here is what gave me hope though:

* Rory chose Logan and believes he is her great love (He won her heart)
* Logan was still in love with Rory (that last scene with the two of them. Knife meet heart. Now I get Matt's guess of Logan's last 4 words, words that were never spoken ""Rory, I love you."")
* Rory does not have romantic feelings for Jess. I was actually shocked at how there was no hint whatsoever on her end. That last look Jess gave was heartbreaking though. 
* The pregnancy was a way to keep Logan in the storyline in a romantic way. I know people say ASP always planned ""Mom"", ""Yeah"", I'm pregnant""  to be the last 4 words but in an interview with Ausiello ASP mentioned that she used them here because it just so happened that it fit the storyline. She could have easily not used them. To me, this is to cover her ass in case they get another season. Jess will always be in Rory's life because of Luke. Now Logan will always be in Rory's life because of their baby.
* ASP alluded to R/L having a baby in ""How many Kropogs to Cape Cod"" when Richard and Emily were gushing about what a child between Rory and Logan would look like. 
* Logan is not Christopher. I truly believe Logan and Rory will end up together eventually. They keep finding each other.
* Finally, It took awhile but it's sunk in that Rory and Logan are having a baby together. A baby. A child. Their DNA melded together forever. Tie that binds. Conceived out of love. In a way, there is nothing more romantic than that.

(Spoiler)",https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5ewe2a/i_wasnt_bothered_by_the_boyfriend_thing_heres_why/,payday1999,1480115282,"When watching it, I thought that Paul was somebody Rory was dating casually. It was said that Rory mostly travels, she doesn't own a place and the one she was staying at in Brooklyn, she hardly stayed at. She was practically sleeping on any couch she could. I thought that whenever she came into town, that they, Rory and Paul, then met up.

I saw it as one step above FWB and one step below being in a serious relationship, like casually dating. All we saw was that Paul texted her and they saw each other once in a while during those two years, when she flew into town. She couldn't even remember that she hadn't set him free yet, when Lorelai asked about him and she couldn't even remember the last time they met. So, I never saw it as a serious thing.

Then I came onto this forum and everybody was saying how she could do this to Paul. And it was interesting to see the different perspectives.

The thing I do have a problem with is what they did to Logan. It's like they destroyed all the progress he made during season 7. It sounds like he's in an arranged marriage, with the way he described it, with the dynasty thing. Who knows what arrangement, he has with his fiance about seeing other people, or if she even knows. But it isn't right, the way they played it out. It seems that Logan still cares for Rory and it seems to go both ways. I don't understand the way it was done and why ASP wrote it out this way. It sounds like Logan went backwards and Rory didn't learn anything the first time around. And if it is an arranged marriage, why is Logan going along with it? His face looked like he wasn't happy about having a fiance. 

I'm glad Rory finally stuck to her guns and ended things, but it should of happened before that point. I wondered why she didn't ask Logan why he is marrying his Fiance, it sounds like Logan doesn't want to.

I also hated that they were trying to paint a parallel between Chris and Logan, especially at the last words we heard. I did not like that Chris didn't take any responsibility for what happened, with how he wasn't there to raise Rory. He painted that it was all Lorelei and that's why he didn't fight for Rory. It was been stated several times, especially in the first season that Lorelai never kept Rory from Christopher and she always kept the door open for him. He just never stepped through it. It sounded like he was trying to paint it in a different light. If he wanted to, he could have been there for her.

Back to the parallel, although we might never see what plays out, I just hope they don't try and make Logan like Christopher. They may have a couple things in common, but Logan is portrayed as being responsible and a hard worker. Rory calls Logan, when something doesn't go right in her life.

Anyways, when I was watching, I was mostly bothered by the character development going on. I thought that the way they did Rory and Logan, could of been done another way. Why did they have to go down that route. It seemed like for people in there 30's, that they are acting like there in their 20's, like they've learned nothing these past 9 years.

And what they did to Rory's character... 
Why did she cheat on basically everyone? Why was that Paul there?
Why was Lorelai so okay with Rory's behaviour? 
Why was she behaving like a spoiled brat? (Some awesome opportunities were basically thrown at her and she just ignored them all.)
I am team Jess, but I was ok with her ending up with Logan, Jess...even Dean, really or single. But not like that. They ruined Logan completely, I actually liked this character. if in OS he was a loveable moron, now he's just a jackass.

So after watching the revival today I ended up feeling disappointed &amp; a little irritated by the character regression, weak jokes &amp; other missteps. I did not like how Logan was portrayed since I feel that he had matured throughout all of Season 7 and wouldn't have behaved the way he did in the revival with the arranged engagement. Rory with the cheating AGAIN annoyed me so much.

Does anyone have any fanfic recommendations that they can volunteer that actually don't have Logan written as the one who has to beg and plead for Rory to return to him, apologize 100x, and just absolve her of any issues in their relationship? I'd be fine with fanfiction that has Logan moving on, or them getting back together but BOTH acknowledging issues. Too many writers love to portray Rory as a saint who can do no wrong in my opinion.

-The Paul thing didn't have a purpose in my eyes and made Rory seem like a jerk 
-The middle two episodes I was actually bored at parts (the musical omg) They seemed to have so many unnecessary scenes. Them sun tanning and bitching about people in their bathing suits was kind of pathetic 
-Rory working at the Stars Hollow Gazette, also kind of boring and frustrating because it seemed like a waste of time since you know she won't end up there

-Everything about Emily
-Luke was SO perfect as always. Him at the funeral fixing the house made me melt inside. Such a great, consistent character. 
-The whole last episode was very well written and edited in my opinion. I felt much more engaged emotionally and was mostly satisfied with the story line. 
-Lorelai telling the story about her father
-Rory going into Richard's study, the flash of him sitting there &lt;/3
-Luke declaring his undying love for Lorelai
-The Life and Death Brigade scenes were fun and fantastical even though it makes me kind of ill that there are people that rich.

She's just not someone I can identify with, because she seems to have a bottomless well of opportunities, love interests, and money, and seems unaware (and indifferent to the fact) that these courtesies don't extend to everyone. On the other hand, the same could be said of Lorelei, and I've always had an easy time empathizing with her. It wasn't until the revival that I realized the difference: the acting. 

Rory acts virtually every scene with the same tone of voice and same facial expressions. If there's a part of her that's genuinely emotionally conflicted about an ongoing romantic entanglement with a soon-to-be-married man, she doesn't show it. If she's alarmed by her career stalling (if you call that stalling), or worried about her future in any real way, nothing is communicated with her face, or voice. Her romantic scenes are cringey to watch. Compare Rory kissing anyone to Lorelei kissing just about anyone. The only time any chemistry was present was her relationship with Jess, which probably had a lot to do with them dating in real life. Otherwise, it looks really awkward. 

Her acting limitations were also really, really obvious in any instance where they talked about Richard. I anticipated Rory being one of the more broken-up about it characters, but her face was just...blank. 

I still really enjoy the flow of the show, the cadence of language, and the overall family interaction. This round, it was a lot harder to cheer for a family that has bottomless money, and bottomless opportunity; they don't have to find something, they just have to embrace what's right in front of them. This doesn't match with most of society right now. Still glad I watched all the same. ",6,4,False,self,,,,,

1.  I didn't want to watch 6 hours of Rory and Logan going through the same story line they went through in season 7.  We already saw that and know how it ends.  What a waste of this revival to retell this story! Pointless drivel.

2.  Why only 5 mins of Jess and no scenes that showed any of that amazing Rory Jess chemistry?  This was the most disappointing thing about the entire revival.

3.  I hate that Rory is completely unlikable now. Cheating on her bf and helping Logan cheat? And not an ounce of guilt? What is left to like about her?  What is left to relate to?

4.  Aside from Deans scene I really did love Emily's story line and the struggle to find herself after Richard's death.  Very very faint silver lining....

TLDR: Happy overall with the stories and characters. The musical was atrocious. Rory and Logan did NOT suffer character assassination. Kinda left wanting by the end (and not really in the good way). Emily is a goddess. Overall, I'd score it a B. 

Long version, and hold on to your hats because it certainly is long -- I have lots of feelings and no one to text: 
Wow. Okay. So. That happened. Here are my thoughts:

- After about 20 minutes into Winter, I felt like all the characters got back into the vibe and rhythm very well. By the second episode, I was enthralled again. 

- Rory and Logan....okay. So, while a lot of people are calling it ""character assassination,"" I just don't see it that way. While I wasn't quite expecting this angle of the boyfriends triangle, I can't say I was entirely surprised. Rory has a history of not quite being faithful to the guys in her life. She emotionally cheated on Dean with Jess; then slept with Dean when he was married; then led Marty on while pining for Logan; then tried to cheat on Logan with Jess. Rory doesn't do well with respecting monogamous relationships if she wants the guy. It kind of makes sense to me that, as part of her rootless existence, she would talk herself into thinking that the ""what happens in Vegas"" attitude with Logan is totally acceptable as long as no one gets hurt and they understand that it's just a sex-for-room-and-board type deal. (Though, of course, by the end of Winter we realize it's more than that.) As far as Logan goes, it doesn't hugely surprise me for him, either. Yeah, he'd grown a lot by season 7. But people regress all the time; improving his relationship skills for one girl for a year or so does not mean he wouldn't fall to old habits later for that same girl, let alone the girl he wanted to marry. So, basically, I don't think it's character assassination because I believe it's very in character for both of them to behave this way. I kind of enjoyed the whole arc, actually. It was an unexpected boyfriend angle, and I liked what they did with it.

- I was very pleased when Rory had a different ""boyfriend"" than the three main guys because, seriously, it's been a decade so why would she only have the three of them to choose from? But I will never, for the life of me, understand why they stole the Ann joke from Arrested Development. Yeah, I can see Lorelai, Luke, Emily et al forgetting specific conversations or traits about him (""oh, we had an in-depth conversation about historical tools? Um, okay...yeah, I *toootally* remember that!""), but literally not remembering he was there, or what his name was, or that they had met him a number of times (and not just one person forgetting, but everyone across the board, including Rory!) feels so out-of-universe here. Although, how Rory treated him was another example of how bad she is with dudes. Some people in other threads had argued about how they were just casually dating and not really serious, but ""not really serious"" boyfriends don't keep track of how many years you've been ""together,"" or visit your mother's and grandmother's homes, or bring their family heirloom crescent wrenches to bond with your stepfather. I think they were (at least, to him) fairly monogamous and if not serious, then stable. Which makes it all the more crazy that he did not break up with her for her horrible treatment of him sooner. I get that it was the running gag, but it could have been handled better. 

- Lorelai's arc with Luke gave me so much anxiety (but in a good, suspenseful way!). I've always been a Luke/Lorelai shipper, and I think if we had ended with them parted, I would have cried such anger tears. And while before the revival, I was fully against them having the same ol' relationship problems, it did not feel too rehashed to me. It felt like the troubles of a couple that's been together nine years and were going through a rough patch, who had fallen into a rut, questioning themselves and their world. Also, Luke's speech where he fights harder for her than he ever has was easily the single best scene of the revival, rivaled only by Lorelai's call to her mother (oh my god! We'll get there below). Though I think Lorelai and Luke's wedding sequence felt a little dreamlike, I was able to get lost in it. And when they played the ""Luke can waltz!"" song...oh I had such happy tears in my eyes! Luke felt so real in this series, and I was really glad. From the trailer, I was a little worried he'd be relegated to the back burner or something. I'm not sure why. Something about his whole first scene (the scene from the trailer) had me somewhat anxious. But he did wonderfully, I think. 

- Babette and Morey grilling sausages in the movie theater is one of my favorite things. 

- Lane and Zach living in Sookie's house, also awesome. 

- So, I legitimately thought the therapist was Mae Whitman until we saw Mae Whitman during the ""Lines"" thing. Whoops. 

- Emily's arc over the entire revival was superb. I would have literally watched six hours of nothing but her. I love how disillusioned she becomes with her past life; it had meaning because it was supporting her husband and the life they had together. I love that, though she battles depression and loneliness, she figures out exactly what *she* wants and goes for it unabashedly. Her ""bullshit"" speech made me incredibly joyful. (I also love that Luke caught Emily tricking Lorelai into therapy before she did!! Too funny.) I feel like she can finally understand the choices Lorelai made in her life, and I hope it brings them closer than ever.

- Lorelai's call to Emily. Holy shit, it was so good. It so perfectly encapsulated Lorelai (young and older), Emily, and Richard. It was beautifully delivered (Lauren Graham is the best cryer of television) and wonderfully written. Emily sitting up out of bed to listen to it was amazing -- this is her daughter, finally acknowledging something amazing and wonderful that happened while she was at home, and fixing the funeral blunder, and apologizing for it and all the crap between them all in one. 

- The whole revival making fun of millennials was at times funny, at times trying wayy too hard. The ""30-something gang""? Really? It felt very sitcom-y and out-of-universe. The whole ""book vs. movie"" Wild people? Same thing, though less egregious. Though I loved Luke tricking all the laptop drones with fake WiFi passwords. When he gave out the first password, I was like, ""Aw man, this sucks."" Then he gave the second one, and I was like ""Oh Luke, this is why you're my favorite."" (Who am I kidding? They're all my favorite!) And Jess ripping out the router when they find the real password was boss. 

- Rory and the online website interview...faults on both sides. Why the hell were they literally begging her to work there if they didn't have a spot specifically for her? That feels a bit juvenile and a waste of everyone's time to me. And why would Rory -- who at this point is a professional with what seems to be an impressive resume (even if all she really has is the New Yorker article, she had to have some professional know-how to land it) -- walk into a job meeting of any kind with absolutely no preparation? Though the boss lady was kind of a dick about it when she called to reject Rory, I did not at all blame her for not extending the job to Rory. Also, Rory losing it on the phone with her was such a bad call. You're a professional -- act like one! I had so much secondhand embarrassment for Rory, though I felt like it was all really well done. The final straw in Rory rejecting this journalism world. 

- Rory writing ""The Gilmore Girls""... not sure how I feel about it. As a writer and editor myself, the whole ""the show was really the story that Rory was writing!""-type angle is not that much better than the ""it was allll a dream!"" to me. Even if that's not quite what the thing was implying, it was close enough. But, as a fan, it felt kinda gooey and wonderful. So, I'm still a bit torn on that one. Rory and Lorelai's fight about it actually feels right. Lorelai wants to keep her life private (after all, she's seen Rory's earlier writing where she thinks she's painting people playfully but is being kinda vicious), and Rory feels like this is what she needs to turn her life around. While I hated the fight at first, I think it was very natural. And I think Lorelai telling her to finish it is natural: she is trusting her best friend with her most precious possession -- their life together. 

- Gypsy as Berta was amazing. I also loved how Emily *finally* kept a maid! (And her family!) It was a surprising but nice touch. Though the whole, ""What language are they speaking? WTF?"" got old to me, though I'm willing to overlook it for the rest of the amazingness. 

- I am thoroughly Team Jess, and I seriously got my hopes up in Fall when he looked longingly through the window. Though I think I'm happy that she ended up with no one in the end (which is what I wanted before). I feel like I wish Jess had a little more to do here -- he felt a little plot device-y at times -- but I thought he did an incredible job with what he had. 

- WHYYYYY did Paris and Doyle divorce? I mean, I guess I kind of accept it -- Paris is so hot tempered, I'm surprised they made it quite that long -- but they were soo perfect! Although, I did love that Paris took her medical and legal expertise and created a fertility clinic. She felt like a pimp the whole time, and I loved it! 

- Dean felt like an afterthought. I get it would have been weird without him (but, really, would it have been?), but it just didn't feel natural. Though damn Jared is delicious, so there's that. 

- The musical was atrocious. Why was it there? It should have been a 5-minute arc, max. This literally felt like Amy saying, ""Sutton, we're gonna get you in there somehow!"" and just slapping it in there. WTH? How did not a single editor or cast member think, ""This is long and atrocious, why are we doing this?"" I literally checked my watch during it; it kind of spoiled that whole episode for me. The only good thing about it was the song that spurred Lorelai to go into nature (the Fall arc, which I did enjoy for the most part). Even that, though, could have been accomplished with Sutton making a cameo as a cabaret singer or something at The Secret Bar; Lorelai goes to get a drink alone, she's feeling down on life, and Sutton sings this song. Bim bam boom -- good to go. 

- Christopher acting like Lorelai raised Rory alone because that was how she wanted to do it felt cheap of him, though kind of in character for him. She didn't want to get married, she wanted to live her life, but I feel like if Christopher had wanted to move down the street and exchange weekends and co-parent, she would have gladly let it happen. Christopher wanted to be the dad when he wanted to be the dad, and then not worry about it when he didn't. And Lorelai was all right with that, but it's not like she just decided that she would be the primary parent. And, as soon as Rory asked him how he felt about that, I said, ""Well damn,"" because I knew all those people who'd predicted she'd be pregnant, who I just laughed at and said, ""No way!"", were right. Ugh. 

- Oh, the ending. I have so many mixed emotions. On the one hand, it's come full circle which is cool. But...there was so much buildup to ""the last four words,"" and for it to be that just felt...empty. Maybe it's the open-endedness of it, but I just...I was hoping for more. 

- Taylor was sublime. As was Michel. Kirk was, well, Kirk. Which is to say, also perfect. And Petal! I love Petal. And why the fuck was Francie even there? Really? Also, Charleston trying to help Rory with the offer to teach felt a little out of character to me. I more imagine him just kind of judging Rory for being aimless and making not-so-subtle passive aggressive remarks. 

- The episodes themselves: kind of weirdly paced because of the 90 minutes. Especially in Winter, I never quite grasped how long anything took. It was obviously over several weeks or months, but they kind of treated it like just a few days, which felt confusing. I don't know if they improved that with the rest of the episodes or I just got more used to it, but Winter is the worst offender to me. Also, a therapist would never jump up and down and summon over a patient in public like that. From my understanding, they're not even supposed to acknowledge a patient in public unless the patient acknowledges them because of confidentiality and such. (Please correct me if I'm wrong.) Also, my husband called bullshit on Rory not knowing how to find a signal in Stars Hollow and keep it. In Winter, as soon as she was running around, then acted like she'd found a good spot only to keep watching, he got furious because he grew up in a small town with no service and he says that's not what you do. Oh well. 

- I loved the Mr. Kim joke! Lane should have had way more to do. Sookie's brief cameo was so welcome. 

Overall, I'm really happy with what we got. There were flaws, yes, and aspects I was not a fan of, but hey, every show (including the original series) had that. I feel like these actors and writers cared so much about what they were doing, and I felt like I was right back in that world. It was incredible. So, thank you, everyone, for that. 

As I said, I don't really have anyone personal to talk about this with yet, so please feel free to debate and comment below. Please and thanks!

977,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2016-11-26,2016,11,26,10,5ex43s,self.GilmoreGirls,[Spoilers] Mother and Daughter,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5ex43s/spoilers_mother_and_daughter/,Youvegotapicniclife,1480124975,"I have seen this posted quite a few times - that Rory is going to raise her child without the father, and that it shows the parallels between mother and daughter. This is inferred by the fact that she goes to her father at the end and asks him about his involvement (or lack thereof) in her life while she was younger. 

However,  Christopher knew Lorelai was pregnant with Rory, and CHOSE not to become more involved. Lorelai did not hide the pregnancy, in fact because both families knew, they were pressured to get married at such a young age. Yes, Lorelai ran away, but it would not have been too difficult to track her down. She grew up not knowing her father, but that was HIS choice. Lorelai made it easy anytime he wanted to spend time with Rory, in fact, she encouraged it. She made it a point to tell Christopher that he is welcome in Rory's life whenever he wanted.

So for it to even be an option that Rory would not tell Logan, I think is unrealistic and completely wrong. He is the father. He wanted to marry Rory after college, while she was not pregnant - unlike her parents relationship. They are not children anymore, and to even think she may deny him to the be the father of THEIR child, is simply ridiculous. I hate how that is even a consideration. Not to mention, I believe Lorelai would be against it as well. She never denied Christopher to be in Rory's life AND she saw how that played out with Luke. 

If Rory tells Logan, and he chooses to lead a separate life, that is another story. But I can't imagine he would try to flake out.

You may not like it (I'm not saying I was cool with it), but Rory's lack of growth in the matter of her relationships is right in line with what her character has always been, and mirrors Lorelai quite well.

Edit: Forgot to add that the reason they're so bad at relationships is because of their selfish natures.

1. Kelly Bishop being the goddess that she is. She acted her parts beautifully and her last scene was nothing short of emotional.                
2. Dean got closure! I was so happy to see that he is in a situation that, at least I imagine, he his happy in.                               
3. The brief nod towards Mr. Kim made me laugh.                     
4. Liza Weil's.                
5. The fact that Jess is shown to have undergone tremendous growth and the fact that he is now in a stable place in his life.                                   
                                                                 
Here is what I disliked:                                         
1. The revival didn't **feel** like Gilmore Girls. I don't know if I chalk it up to the cinematography, the script, the acting, or a combination of everything. They completely failed to recapture the magic of the OS.                                                
2. The fact that the writers ignored/didn't (further) develop: Lane and Paris. Both amazing characters who I felt were owed much more than they were given.                                            
3. A really big part of the OS was the Stars Hallow atmosphere... I really didn't feel any of that watching any part of the revival.                
4. Why the fuck did they waste 15 minutes of time on a stupid musical?                                           
5. The fact that Jess is still hung up on Rory.                             
6. The fact that Rory hasn't managed to learn from her mistakes in the past 10 years (furthermore, her contentment being part of a cheating dynamic - I always knew she was self-centered but this is just horrendous).                                                      
7. Luke and Lorelai are the epitome of a dysfunctional relationship - didn't like it in the OS and the revival just made it more obvious than it was prior (to me anyway).

She was falling apart all while hating herself for the person she had become and she hated the Logan side of herself and I dunno..I could relate on a level, that feeling that life is spiralling out of control around you and you just can't get a hold of it.

I'm trying to figure this out. The only time I really thought something was up was when she went to visit Christopher. She talked to him on the phone beforehand (or at least I think it was him) and seemed a bit curt or upset. Looking back, that was the only scene to me where it was obvious.

She couldn't have known the last time she saw Logan because she was drinking the night before. (Well, she could have, but I don't see Rory drinking while pregnant.)

In short, she likely knew she was pregnant for all of... three days? I know people are saying it's shitty that she hadn't told Logan before the episode ended, but not much time had elapsed. It's perfect episode 1 material if they decide to renew the show.

Im seeing two descriptors thrown around about Rory, and I dont think theyre very fair.  

(1) Failure

Shes a 32 year old who has had stories published in the New Yorker, Slate, and the Atlantic.  She has high-level meetings with other media outlets, she has a standing offer to teach at a highly-respected school, shes handed the job as editor of the town paper.  Yes, shes at a weird point in her career (havent we all had them?!), but if yall think thats failure, Im glad youre not grading my resume.

Also, if a company snapchatted me a cardboard cutout of me in their office and wooed me for months, I dont think Id show up prepared to pitch them either.  Give her a break.

(2)  Always has been a bad person

Really?  A bad person, or a complex person shaped by her experiences who makes a lot of mistakes just like we all do.  The way some of you are writing about her makes me think none of you have ever made mistakes.  The cheating in all instances is *horrible,* I agree, but in what other specific ways has she always been a bad person?   Every other time she was an asshole (dropping out of Yale &amp; cutting Lorelai off, for instance) I could at least partially relate to how she was thinking and feeling.  Because I also make mistakes.  Occasional asshole  overall bad person.

Okay, the time she reviewed the ballerina sucked.  That was a dick move.

But this is the girl who told Paris shed always be there to listen about Paris parents divorce in the same episode where Paris told everyone about Lorelai and Max.  The girl who thanked her mother and grandparents in her valedictorian speech so touchingly that they all cried.  The girl who dropped everything to come back to Stars Hollow because Luke broke Lorelais heart.  Who stood up to Mitchum Huntsberger about being a bad Father by not coming to the hospital when Logan was hurt.  Who worried about the deer being hurt after it ran into her.  Who served as the telephone intermediate so Lane could talk on the phone with Henry Cho.  Who makes dinner for Dean dressed as Donna Reed to diffuse an argument.  Who tells max she really wanted him to be her stepdad.  Who tries to protect Paris from Francies student council shenanigans.  Throws a birthday party for Lorelai with the worlds largest pizza.  Brings all Richards favorite belongings to the hospital after his heart attack along with fresh clothes for Emily.  Who lets Lane live in her dorm room.  And about a hundred other little things for no other reason than to please Emily &amp; Richard, and Taylor &amp; the town.

I was born in the suburbs of Florida, lived in NY for 6yrs, have traveled the globe and now live in California. I can tell you first-hand that the character development we see here, mostly with Rory and her peers, is very real.

DATING:
Rory dates Paul so casually she often forgets that he exists. Not only is this much in character for Rory (and even Lorelai) but its quite common with casual dating now. Ghosting, or one party thinking the relationship is more serious than the other party is part of the dating tapestry. 

And I know this isnt something we all like to admit, but cheating is very common and very real. Not only has cheating in some form been a constant in the GG universe (even Richard had lunch with Pennilyn Lott for decades without Emily knowing) its just a reality of the times. Yes, Logan is getting married but it seems out of propriety not out of love. Love and commitment are 100% possible and the normal for many people but this is how the other-half lives. Sleeping with an ex, more specifically sleeping with an ex who you know is in a relationship is not only television fodder; its everyday life for many in their 20s and 30s. 

The most unlikely situation is running into ALL of your exes in one year (including Tristan) , and we even see each of those play out in realistic fashion. The Dean scene was so real to me. He seemed nervous and anxious to be catching up with her, but very genuine in wanting to know how she was doing.  I saw the scene as awkward but fast-paced, even for GG, but arent most run-ins with a first love? 

CAREER:
The dream job is not for everyone. With the book, we do not know how successful of a writer Rory will become. In fact, if this truly is the last we see of the crew its implied that she gains success from this story. However, it only makes sense that she would have a rough go of it for a bit. Most of the successful people I know are either a Paris or a Rory. Hitting it out of the park career-wise or relative success with a bit of lost-footing / self-doubt. The truth is, these circles are often not far apart. 

(Side note: Lets be honest. Rory did not prepare for that website interview, and the owner did what any good hiring manager would do: cut it short then move on to the next candidate. )

The scenes of the 30-something gang all living at home and their parents doing what they can to support. While comedic and pitiful, it also bears truth. 

What makes GG so great is how they allow their characters to have real flaws and allow them room to make real bad decisions.  Like it or not, these characters are written very much in the vein of their male anti-hero counterparts. Don Draper, Walter White, Tony Soprano, Lorelai Leigh Gilmore. ",62,68,False,self,,,,,

Thanks Obama.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5ey48r/revival_spoilers_disappointment_in_a_gilmore_gil/,D0ntBeThatGuy,1480140119,"So I saw that someone posted the revival felt a lot like the 2016 Presidential election and I have to agree. It was a disappointment to me but the reason it was a disappointment can be summed up in 1 word: Rory. 

There is a lot to unpack here so I'll just start with this: Thanks Obama. When we last left off with Rory she was leaving to go be a reporter covering the Obama campaign. I think this past Presidential election, the Affordable Care Act, and the Gilmore Girls revival prove anything associated with Obama ends up being a huge disappointment. Also because this is the internet... I will spell it out: I'm joking of course. It's not Obama's fault but people have blaming things on him for years so why not this? Also as I typed that I imagined the meme of Zoidberg saying that. 

In all seriousness though, I loved a lot of the revival but I absolutely hated the story with Rory. It was a huge disappointment. Emily's story line was superb. We got to see Mr. Kim! Paris was hilarious and all of the Stars Hollow denizens were nostalgia gold. I even enjoyed Luke and Lorelai's story. Rory though... it was going good in the beginning. Too good really. Sure I knew Paul was just some rando that we'd never see again after winter but really... Cheating with Logan? An engaged Logan?

Like what the actual ffffffffff... I just don't get it. I don't care if she really loves Logan and he really loves her. That's a terrible way to show it. Oh god, this just hit me, this is just like the last Star Wars movie that came out. Spoiler alert: The Force Awakens is the just a rehash of A New Hope. I thought we already covered the ""other woman"" issue in season 4.  I guess we should be thankful Supernatural is still a thing or else she probably would've been knocked up with one of Dean's kids. 

One of the reasons I didn't like season 7 at first was Rory was obnoxiously dependent on Logan and could seemingly do only wrong only to have a deus ex machina moment to right everything. I'm disappointed in her failure of character (personal qualities/morals/ethics/etc.). With regards to her character, it feels like groundhog day with her in the revival. Sure there was no deus ex machina moment to save her fledgling journalism career (at least not one with closure... her book seems like a potential one) but Rory was acting like a 22 year old and not a 32 year old. 

It's like everyone grew as a person except for her (well I guess you could lump Logan in there too). It just felt like Rory had regressed as a person. While that does happen to people, it seems out of character given the values and support of those around her, but maybe that's where I'm wrong. Maybe that's who Rory Gilmore is. If that's the case, it's a disappointing revelation.",2,8,False,self,,,,,

It was realistic in that things don't always work out perfectly, and the passage of time ends up making that clear. You have to learn to live your life and be happy, despite the imperfections... I'll elaborate: 

While watching I was overwhelmingly aware of the passage of time. Everyone is older: Rory is no longer in highschool with her whole life ahead of her, Richard is gone, Lor and Luke are too old to have children. Things aren't idealic and perfect like they used to be, and youth is starting to fade. But that's realistic. And that's life. And, I like the season because that's what everyone has to deal with, that's what I think about as I get older - old loves, old dreams, nostalgia. I think this season shows that even despite aging, pain, and the passage of time, you can still be happy.

In other words, I think the main thread of the season was dealing with the past and learning to be happy despite the fact that things aren't how they would be in a perfect world - whether that's because you ran away from home and you have difficulties with your parents (Lorelei), you never settled down with someone who loved you (Jess/Rory/Paris/etc), your career never took off, or you're in the same position as you were ten years ago, etc. The characters struggle with this through attachments to unhealthy relationships, the grieving of loved ones, fear of reading Rory's book, etc.

Lets look at Rory's... She's certainly not perfect, and she's 32 -- she won't be having her perfect story book ending. She struggles to let go of that, and stays with people from her past who make her feel comfortable. Flawed but realistic.  Luke and Lorelei deal with the passage of time in a different way -- they're married, but have missed out on so much time being married (though they have been together). Emily grieves for her loved on and happier times. despite dealing with these very human struggles, all three manage to find happiness.

It's a realistic human struggle dealt with in a thoughtful way. People aren't perfect, the characters shouldn't be either.

I found the idea that Paris' kids are being raised by nannies so sad.  Similarly, jokingly calling surrogate women ""breeders"" and treating them like chattel was not funny. Surrogacy is very hard emotionally for both the mother who can't bare her own child and the surrogate placed with such awesome responsibility. I found her so callous in the way she brought up the concept.

Don't get me started on her thinking it would make a better ""full circle"" ending to have a baby raised by a single parent instead of the possibility of the child having the love of two parents (and we're talking about Logan or someone who is responsible not wife beaters or anything)  I'm not even saying the parents have to be together but why make it seem like a single household is the better option? Children deserve two caring parents. It doesn't always work out that way but it's like the idea was off the table because it didn't go with the ending she wanted.

She went to college, she got a degree, she traveled (on her own), she saw the world and she experienced so many things which Lorelai never did. 
My point is, she is a different person. So we need to stop drawing the parallels between her/jess &amp; Lorelai/Luke.

Emily and her five stages of grief 

Denial - Emily in host mode at the funeral. Still acting as Emily Gilmore, wife to Richard Gilmore, DAR darling, hostess extraordinaire, bossy boss to maids - she has yet to feel the whole weight of Richard's death. 

Anger - The extremely emotional scene with Lorelai and Emily and the no good, terrible story, is the catalyst for this stage that seems to last for the four months, as shown in the first FND with Rory, and her refusal to respond to Lorelais emails.  

Bargaining - Emily doing all she can to release her pain and ridding herself of all that doesn't bring her joy. 

Depression - sleeping until noon, acting up at DAR meetings, leaving therapy. Living from day to day as a zombie, a sort of shell of the person she once was. 

Acceptance - Moving to nantucket, defining herself and finding a life of her own. She is no longer Emily Gilmore, wife of Richard Gilmore. She isn't a DAR darling. She can no longer be the woman who hosted parties with only the best linens and tapers, six inches apart. She is her own woman and she finds a life, job, and happiness in her own being.

Why is everyone so sure Rory is going to keep the pregnancy?

Yes, she's found out she's pregnant and had chats with Christopher and Lorelai (I presume that if we see no more after the four words they'll hash it out). But maybe all of her life experience - particularly with an unavailable Dad - mean that she knows this isn't right for her kid.

I will disclose - I am not a fan of the on-going cheating of Logan and Rory. I can see that Paul and Odette are such non-entities but that excuses nothing to me. I also don't enjoy the projections of however much or little involvement of either Logan or Jess in raising this child to replicate the Lorelai-Luke-Christopher relationships.

I just think Rory had a good chance at distinguishing herself in this situation, and I think she won't mature in the same way as Lorelai did when she knew she was having a child (the phrase ""I wasn't a child as soon as the strip turned blue"", or whatever Lorelai argued with Emily that one time really resonated with me).",7,4,False,self,,,,,

Logan is Rory's Christopher, Jess very obviously loves her and is bound to be her Luke and that's it?! It honestly feels cheap to have the show end that way. I was always firmly #TeamJess but I can't find any joy in this scenario. I always thought he genuinely loved her and that if she saw that, they'd make a great couple. I never hated Logan but I always got the sense that he was unable to break free from his family. It seems like I got that right...yay?!

Rory spent months (yrs?) being the ""other woman"" in Logan's life, gets knocked up and now we're supposed to believe that everything will somehow be okay because Christopher delivered his stupid ""the Gilmore Girls are a force of nature"" speech?! I know life isn't all rainbows and kittens -- cheating happens, people break up yada yada yada. But ASP is romanticizing this whole ""full circle"" aspect way too much. And here I am, feeling like none of the characters are happy. 

Rory was struggling already, trying to find her purpose in life. Now she's gonna be a single mother. At 32, she admitted she was still figuring things out for herself and now she's stuck caring for another human. I'm not saying she's unfit to be a mom -- all of Stars Hollow will help to raise that baby and it will be showered with love and affection just like Rory was but still. 

Logan is about to marry some French girl and tbh, he's emotionally crippled much in the same way as Chris. I feel bad for the guy. Instead of trusting his own instincts, he's his dad's puppet. I always liked him, he was smart and funny and I wouldn't have been mad if #TeamLogan had won. I've seen the word character assassination getting thrown around... it's not too far off unfortunately.

Jess always got painted as the bad boy, the flake but he's there for the people he loves and out of all of Rory's boyfriends, he was the one who called her out on her bs and who pushed her. And what does he get? Years worth of pining? Seeing Luke pine for Lorelai in the Original series was painful to say the least and his speech at the beginning of ""Fall"" really summed it all up perfectly... sorry Jess, looks like you're gonna have to go through the same shit! Tough break, buddy.

ASP overdid it big time. Paris and Lane are also doing things just like their mothers. :(

I see a lot of people - here and elsewhere online - hoping and wishing for more episodes. Personally, I really don't. The reason being (and I'm quoting myself now with a comment I left elsewhere on reddit):

Even with the cliffhanger at the end, the story has been told.
Emily's story arc ended perfectly. We saw her finding her new place in the world without Richard; the phone call in the fourth episode finally brought peace between her and Lorelai; she sold the house and she moved away. And finally kept a maid for once! Perfect closure. 

Same with Lorelai &amp; Luke. We know what their future will look like. With Luke keeping his Diner like it always was, Lorelai expanding the Inn and knowing they will be happy, even without having a baby together. And of course their wedding, which was a truely magical scene, and a beautiful way to end their storyline.

So for me, making another sequel about Rory and the baby would tarnish all of that a bit. Because how would it look like? With Emily completely out of the picture now that she moved? Would Lorelai become the new Emily, not being happy the way Rory raises the child? New conflicts between Luke &amp; Lorelai, simply to fill up the episodes with content?

So I'm wondering, make me a sales pitch, what you would like to see in more episodes. I'm wondering if your ideas would make me change my mind :D",4,8,False,self,,,,,

I found his lack of personal growth in the last ten years disappointing, especially since he had so much in the original series. 



So we all know that he started out as this party boy with charm and witty comebacks and after getting kicked in the pants he became a business professional with charm and witty comebacks. Logan was so in love with Rory but I 100 percent understood why Rory turn down his proposal. 



So fast forward ten-ish years Logan still loves Rory and Rory still has feelings for him. Ok fine. Turns out hes engaged. Ok fine. Although I dont condone affairs we dont know the whole story. Then we find out that the affair has been going on for over a year as well as hes been engaged the whole time. Not fine. At the tango club Rory asks Logan if hes really going to get married. Logan responds with Thats the dynastic plan. Really not fine.



So after all these years Logan hasnt grown a pair to stand up to his family. Hes getting married and she has the seal of approval from the Huntzberger clan. The one thing Rory could never get. 



Logan probably doesnt love her as much as he loves Rory. However there is one thing that Logan loves more that Rory and thats his luxurious, pompous, hedonistic lifestyle that he has all his life. He lost it once and failed and couldnt handle it. Im not blaming him its all he has ever known. Im sure he has some of his own money but its not enough compared to family money.



Logan will always love the perks of being a Huntzberger more than Rory. Rory will never win.

I didn't see the engagement as being a family mandated/arranged thing that he was just mindlessly going along with, but instead was a decision he 100% made on his own.

Because you guys are right-it doesn't line up with Logan's characterization to date someone just because his family wanted him to. In the scene with Mitchum, it's clear that while he approves of the situation, there's zero implication that it was his doing in some way (i think Mitchum even says Logan ""got himself engaged""). Logan himself also never expresses any regret or desire to end the engagement. Logan in the revival is clearly someone who's very powerful (the costume designer even said he doesn't have to answer to anyone), and he's a grown man in his 30s. Why the hell would he let himself be led around by his daddy? On top of that he has Odette move in with him. Again, a decision that seems to be 100% his own doing. If this was an arranged thing why would he have her move in with him before they're even married? Probably because he actually wanted her to. His ""dynastic reasons"" comment was just his justification for what he was doing. 

I think this was Logan wanting to have his cake and it too. He knows that someone of his caliber in society needs to marry someone in his league, but he still wanted to have his fling and fun times with Rory.",232,179,False,self,,,,,

The most obvious being 'The Reigning Lorelai'. With A Year in the Life these metaphors have come to a head.

We'll start off at the beginning though. Trix Gilmore. Lorelai I

http://imgur.com/34JNXrj

Trix is very clearly Queen Victoria. Trix Gilmore as I recall was never seen in a colour other than black. She married her cousin and never seemed to really be amused by anything at all. Surprisingly Richard finds Trix and Rory a lot alike and we can't seem to see it in these episodes. Unlike Queen Victoria she seems to get along great with her son, Queen Victoria apparently came up with the term 'lay back and think of England' so its understandable why she was perhaps not so loved by her family. 

What Richard sees in Rory is perhaps the same will to rule. Rory, seems to me like something of an Elizabeth I.

http://imgur.com/Q7bCeMl

Over and over again we are told by Amy and the cast that Rory cares more for books than boys. I think we see that validated in A Year in the Life in a similar way to Queen Elizabeth. To break it down the key is this scene:

http://imgur.com/nCU7Y2y

-Elizabeth was the cleverest ruling monarch England ever had (Elizabeth II I would argue is equally smart but she doesn't rule). See her portrait with the book, with her dressed all in red. Its a nod I think to the portrait of young Elizabeth I with her book. That portrait is very prominent when she ascends her throne. We see her coronation procession through the house that is 'all hers', metaphorically the Gilmore legacy. She walks into her grandfather's study, sees him at his desk. We see Rory in the context of this portrait as she ascends her throne in Richard's study compared to her 'throne' in the painting.

-Eizabeth after having her heart broken it seems decided to marry her country. For a girl who cares more for books than boys we see Rory do this when she undertakes her novel. She has married her work. This is reinforced at the end with Rory saying she plans on living as a spinster. I can see her going through with it, pass the Gilmore name to her child and never marry.

-For most of her youth Elizabeth was considered 'illigitimate', she barely saw her father who could never hold a relationship. Not saying Chris is a murderer but its formative experience.

What about Lorelai? She abdicated a long time ago and ends the series no longer a Gilmore.

Mitchum Huntzberger and Logan Huntzberger: Henry IV and Henry V

This is very Shakespearian and I'm not sure if Amy goes along with Shakespeare or subverts Shakespeare or both.

Henry V or Prince Hal is Henry IV's heir but he eschews responsibility to drink and sleep with women in the back streets of London. This is important because it helps Henry in his exploits at Agincourt to know how to inspire his men and be one of them but his father doesn't see it that way. He thinks he is a waster and lays into him that he is not the son he should be. Upon his father's death Henry ascends the throne, marries a French princess and disavows his previous life including Falstaff a man who was more a father to him than his own father. Henry V becomes a hero and English legend when he defeats the French but he dies young leaving his Empire to his baby all this eventually leads to the Wars of the Roses and everything Henry achieved is destroyed.

Whereas in the original series it seemed like they were setting Rory up as the person that will get Logan from Hal to Henry the revival paints her as his Falstaff. A representation of the life he has to give up when he is king. Odette being French is no coincidence. However, we aren't led to believe by Shakespeare that the life of Prince Hal is a good thing and his casting aside of Falstaff while heartbreaking is probably for the best. We are left in Henry IV with a sense of hope because we know of Henry's coming greatness, that the sacrifice is worth it. Amy doesn't do that, she gives us the end of Henry V where Henry is dead and we sense the impending doom. Henry V ends talking about baby Henry VI who will effectively destroy the Plantagenet line. Gilmore Girls ends with Rory going to have a baby which will likely destroy the Huntzberger dynasty by its mere existence. Amy shows us Logan's transformation into Henry V but it doesn't seem like its a positive. It doesn't seem like Logan is becoming a better man. Rory is the only part of his past he casts aside although that night does seem the end of the Life and Death Brigade for that generation. Amy leaves us with just tragedy. In this way Henry the suit of armour is constantly looming over Logan in the series

TL/DR: The Huntzbergers are doomed, the Gilmores are about to enter their golden age.

Lorelei = Rory, Chris = Logan, and Luke = Jess. Personally I don't see this at all but i'm really curious as to what the rest of you think. 

First of all when it comes to L/C and R/L, Chris and Lorelai were kids themselves when they had Rory. Sure they might have loved each other but the love you feel at 16 is very different to the love you feel as an adult when so many other factors come into play. Rory and Logan loved each other. They lived together, they were very settled and probably a lot more settled and coupley than a lot of other couples their age.   

We always saw Chris being flighty, saying he'd be there or call and then bailing. Logan was never like this once he and Rory got together. He flew thousands of miles just to spend a day or two with her when he was living in London and she was still at Yale.  When Richard had his heart attack he dropped everything to be by her side in the hospital. Chris didn't even answer Lorelai's calls for hours. 

Chris's family blamed Lorelai for everything that went wrong in his life and he didn't do much to stop them either. The way his parents treated Rory was awful and again, we don't see much of a reaction from him on this. Logan's family were pretty catty to Rory when they first met her and Logan stormed out of dinner after telling them all where to go. 

Finally for me, the biggest indicator is that when Lorelai was with Chris, you always got the impression that she was still thinking of Luke. We never saw this with Rory and Logan, especially in the revival there was no hint of anything but platonic feelings toward Jess from Rory's side.  

I can understand why people might want to see Jess as Rory's Luke and I think this may be what ASP thinks too but there seemed to be no romance vibes of them at all in the revival. 
Ok, so we had that scene of Jess looking in the window, but that might be just looking back with fondness and nostalgia, like Rory seemed to do when she ran into Dean.
From Rory's side it seemed totally platonic. If she really cared for/loved him, wouldn't she have been in touch with him at least once in the 4 years she mentions? All the years that Lorelai and Luke weren't together there were glances and remarks, like when Sookie and Jackson were on a date and Luke passed some comment like 'maybe sometime you and I could...' to Lorelai. There has been nothing like that from Rory and Jess.

I don't care that some stuff was sappy or cliche or whatever, it's GG, I've waited for years, I don't care. As far as I'm concerned, it was great. 

So, my impression on Rory: 

Financially: She is a 32 year old who lives off of people(Lorelai, Lane, Logan, Emily) and now is going to have a baby and she'll rely on everyone else to financially raise her kid too, since she's broke. Also, Rory being broke is no one's fault but hers since she wants a particular job, not any job. No one is talking about taking a job against your morality but when you need to pay the bills and be independant, if it's a legal, decent job, in the field you are working in, even, you TAKE it. Unless you are Rory and you have the option to mooch offf of people, then I guess you're picky and choose to be uneployed(hey, who doesn't like money to drop from the sky and everything to be free). 

Now onto the relationship: Someone asked here if we think Rory regretted helping Dean cheat on Lindsey. Well, I think we have our answer now: Nope, she is not sorry, she liked it so much she's doing it again to Logan's fiancee and her poor boyfriend Paul. It's digusting but Logan was HERS FIRST so, I guess....nope. still disgusting.

Bottom line: Rory has not grown and has not learned anything in the past 10 years, if anything her flaws are more present than ever before. She still hasn't learned that cheating is messed up, she still hasn't learned that you can't start at the top, you have to start at the bottom and work your way up. I can only imagine what she'll raise her kid to be like. By the way, is Logan the father? Or the one night stand? Oh I cannot believe she thought that the one night stand was the issue, not the fact that she was sleeping around with an engaged man behind her boyfriend's back, that actually made me laugh.

Let's see, what else didn't I like(lol): oh yeah, when she finally decided she should try to make some a living, it was by selling her mother's private life(lol at her confusion and rage at Lorelai's-natural-reaction).

It's not the ending. It's a lot of what happened in-between. 

I would have not included Paul. Or at least not have made the relationship seem so serious (from his point of view). If they wanted to paint Rory as a casual dater, fine. Have her dating a few people, not one that she forgets to break up with. And Logan can be one of those people, but don't have him in a serious relationship either. 

Include a brief back history on Logan and why he's working where he is. What happened? 

More Jess/Rory. Or at least some more hints of him pining for her. If ASP was going for all the parallels/full circle thing, have more. Not just him staring wistfully at Rory through a window.

And as for Rory's career, have her interviewing for various places throughout the revival. That would have been fun. Different websites/newspapers/magazines. Or have her editor of the SH Gazette near the beginning. Show her interviewing people in the town, instead of that weird NY line stuff. 

Luke/Lorelai needed to be further in their relationship. It doesn't make sense that they never talked about getting married or having kids if they were together for 9 years. The surrogate story ended up going nowhere, and wasn't needed. They could have had a moment where they talked about it- maybe regretted it not happening. Maybe they tried 9 years ago and it didn't work out. Lorelai's ""Wild"" thing went on too long. There were too many book vs movie ""jokes"" that fell flat. I would have had her intending to go through the trail right at the beginning, but then backs out. Making excuses (something like 'I should go use a real toilet while I still can!') and then she can see the beautiful scenery, have her moment, and still call Emily. And a real wedding moment. I get why the elopement happened, but it was so rushed. 

I wouldn't change Emily's story. It was the one storyline that worked.

I'm curious what are the reactions to the lunch scene in Spring between - especially - Logan and Mitchum. (I don't believe I've seen this exact topic posted).

Why would Logan purposefully bring Rory to lunch in a ""family holding"" and intentionally buy the $300 wine to alert Mitchum? What message was he trying to send to Mitchum/the Huntzbergers? I'm ambivalent about this. 

On the one hand, it could be suggested it's a ""Sorry pops, you can't 'force my hand' in marriage. I'm still going to live my life how I want. I don't care about that 'arranged' marriage. Your rules don't matter to me."" Because Logan really loves Rory and he's sending a message that he's not afraid to be seen with her.

Or, was Logan using Rory as a prop to his father? That she really was there as an emblem of his general displeasure with the dynasty and it was no more than a poke to Mitchum? There could be many other Rory's with this line of thought.

Orrr, a totally different meaning than those two!

I'm struggling (like I see a lot of others!) with the OS Logan v. Revival Logan. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like this and the LDB scene are the only moments where we really see Logan as an agent/initiator of events in the revival. At least as an absolute.

Lorelai is a great friend to Rory, but never a good mom. Lorelai did the opposite of what her mother did to her(Overbearing). She became Rory's best friend instead of a mother. She made mistakes on when to pull the mother card and when not to pull it.

My biggest irritation, when Rory decides to drop out of Yale, I was surprised that Lorelai didn't support Rory, instead decided to pull the mother card. Rory was feeling lost and doesn't know what to do with her life during that period, and losing her mother's support drove her into the hands of her grand parents.

I feel like she should have figured out then itself, not ten years after graduating from Yale.

That brings me to next thing, Lorelai is too quick to forgive Rory for her mistakes, which is again the opposite of Emily. When Rory came back and joined Yale, she forgave her, when Rory slept with Dean, she forgave her and a whole lot of other times in the show. In a way which made Rory feel like she is not facing any consequences.

She mostly protected Rory from the consequences of her bad decisions during the original show.

But in the end I understand why Lorelai did all this, she didn't want to be like her mother. Only by the end of revival could Lorelai accept her past mistakes with her parents, she finally stopped rebelling against Emily. She accepted Emily for who she is and let go.

And also indirectly added a lot of responsibilty on Rory's shoulders to have the life which Lorelai couldn't. And in the end, Rory couldn't handle the pressure by the end of revival. She had lot of expectations placed on her by her mother, grandparents, Stars Hollow people.

As for Stars Hollow, it is place like neverland, where things always remain the same, but the whole world outside is changing. It is a place where it is shielding the residents from the harsh realities of the real world. Living in this wonderland for too long during her childhood made Rory entitled and privileged and often too soft. She couldn't handle rejection or failure very well due to this.

Rory couldn't accept the fact that Journalism field is changing too quickly for her to catch up, and couldn't accept the fact that she is not suitable for this line of work.

I think in revival, they subtly shown this aspect, where people couldn't face the real world, all those 30-somethings staying in stars hollow.

Stars Hollow is a great place to live, if you are the kind of person who is content with what they do and have, people like Luke. But not  for people like Rory, who wants to do more. In a way, it acted like a escapist route for Rory during her professional struggles.

My only hope for Rory is that, she should leave Stars Hollow for good and stay in some city, where she is just any other woman, which will make future boy/girl to be more aligned to the real world, rather than the crazy wonderland.

I hope she becomes the kind of mother not too bearing, not too friendly like a normal mother. Hopefully a mix of Emily and Lorelai.

Forever in the debt of user gilmoregabs for turning us onto this point.  Thought it needed its own thread.

In the original series Emily is often shown very unsympathetically, because it is from Lorelei's perspective.  Emily groomed her to be a certain kind of person, and Lorelai eventually rebelled, despite intelligence and talent. A lot of Lorelei's animosity toward her parents was about their (negative) reaction to her pregnancy, and she was in fact so upset about it that she broke ties and kept their granddaughter from them.

Watching the OS many of us cheer on Lorelai for this. There is also the class difference - to most of us L represents more of a working class, do-it-your-own way ideal. We judged Emily harshly.

We were also as invested as Lorelai was in making sure Rory gets a ""better"" future, that she doesn't repeat the same ""mistakes,"" that she doesn't hurt people and keep people at a distance the way her mother did.  And so when we heard those final four words, we were livid. We were disappointed. We were betrayed.

Just like Emily.  Maybe just like Lorelai.

But it isn't a pessimistic circle. It's an optimistic one. Rory will have so much more support than Lorelai did, because Lorelai, Emily, and Luke will all be there for the baby and her. They've all matured, they have all mellowed.  Lorelai will get even more of a chance to heal her relationship with Emily, now that she will be able to live the situation from her perspective (and a much less jarring one, since Rory is 32 not 15).  And down the line, after Rory gets things together, she will find her person, as Lorelai said. Maybe it will take years, maybe not. Maybe that person will be Jess, or (God help me), Logan, maybe not.

Either way, as they said, it's the journey.

Kudos, ASP. Kudos.

Here's a scary thought - Emily never had her own identity until that scene where she's scaring that group of kids at the museum in Nantucket with her whaling story. She was always ""Mrs. Richard Gilmore,"" as she said when talking about her credit cards, and we realize she wasn't ever really connected to the DAR or the club in a deep or meaningful way, to the point where she could easily throw them both away when she tired of them.

That scene made me realize that maybe she's a LOT more like Lorelai than I ever gave her credit for - she showed off a quirky sense of humor, an ability to be entertaining to herself first and others second, and has a vibrant personality that shines best when she's flying solo.

Here's where it gets sad: what if Emily has always been that person we see in that scene, but she forcefully suppressed those traits to fit in with Richard's world, and as a result, she tried to suppress Lorelai when she saw those traits in her? That led to Lorelai running away, and that hurt Emily all the more because her daughter lived with those traits brightly shown for all the world to see, and Emily was still pushing them away.

If that's true, I think that Emily and Lorelai can be great friends going forward. I'm going to rewatch the parts where Emily and Richard are 'separated' and see if it backs any of this up.",90,408,False,self,,,,,

This is what was intended all along? Rory was destined to get knocked up? Exactly like her mother? Even though THE WHOLE SERIES is about Lorelai giving Rory a different life so that she doesn't end up like her? 

Rory's character was so inspiring at one time, and it was what set this show apart from others - that, and Stars Hollow. Now we find ourselves at the end of the series, and Rory is living at home in her thirties, jobless, boyfriendless, ""writing a book"" about her life (of course - everything is ALWAYS about her), knocked up by her college boyfriend whom she openly cheated with for four years, meaning she also has very little integrity anymore. Was she supposed to be tragically flawed? GG never was about ""real life"" - it was about whimisical, flattish characters living in an idyllic, fairy-tale town, where all the boys are in love with the nerd and Lorelai is a single mother with a date whenever she wants it. Not real life. It was an ESCAPE. We escaped into this fanciful narrative and watched a dream-like mother/daughter relationship unfold before our eyes. And now this? Suddenly GG is about ""real life?"" No. I'm not okay with that.

I thought this show had a feminist bent? So why the mistress storyline,  and the pregnancy, and the sad, self-absorbed, emotionally shaky women? 

We end the show with...wait for it...Luke and Lorelai getting married in the last thirty minutes, even though they acted married the whole six hours and this was something we all knew was destined to happen. The little wedding was perfect, but what's up with the fact that we didn't even get to see the big wedding? And how did Lorelai evolve? We find her asking her mother for money in the end so she can expand her inn. Same old same old. And is she expanding the inn just for Michel? What?!

Lorelai would have loved the musical (like I did!). Wasn't laughing at bad art her SPECIALTY? Isn't that why she LOVED the Stars Hollow museum in the original series?

Also she would NEVER have tried to hike that trail!

Even that hike resulted in very little character development. The story she told her mom about her dad was beautiful and tear-wrenching - but was that what ""getting away"" was all about for her? We don't see her wrestle with her relationship with her mother or Luke in her ""finding herself"" Journey.

Skokie never cared about growing vegetables. She only EVER cared about cooking them.

I love Emily and she and Lauren Graham made the show - but she really culminates by telling gruesome whale stories in a museum? Really?!

Lane...is the same.

Paris hates her kids, her husband, her life. She's the same.

Luke is the exact same

Suddenly Jess is a completely different person and we have no explanation for it. He's a people person who loves to offer counsel and take care of Luke. His biggest flaw is that he still seems to care about selfish, spiraling, cheating Rory. There are better women out there and he deserves one of them! 

And there's a Mr. Kim? Was that a JOKE? But we're suddenly supposed to take the show so seriously? Because it's about ""real life""???

I loved many things about this revival - but I could not be more disappointed for how it turned out. I think I very much overestimated ASP's abilities..

You can say so much about the good aspects of Logan, but the bad outweighs the good. So here we go in no particular order. 

He is a money cushion. He taught Rory that she can do whatever she wants because he has money. 

He is a cheater. He is essentially the rich playboy that everyone hates. Except of course every team Logan member. He has sex all the time when he's sad. 

He kept Mitchum at bay throughout the series. If Mitchum and Rory were in each others lives, she could have gotten a good job as a journalist, and she wouldn't be in the situation she is in now.

He doesn't use birth control. I know that it's an unfair assumption, but he is cheating. And Rory's pregnant. I don't believe that he uses a condom. 

He always comes around when Rory is stewing and asks cute to make Rory forgive him. 

When Logan asked Rory to marry him, he couldn't have expected a yes. Rory hasn't even graduated college yet. But he just left when she said no. You shouldn't quit when they say no. I can't blame him too much for this. Lorelei does this with Luke, Dean and Jess do this with Rory.

Jealousy is a huge thing for him. It may be the biggest underlying problem. When Jess showed up, Logan and Rory broke up. This shows a huge amount of jealousy. But when Logan spends a huge amount of time with Bobbi, Rory is laughed at when she shows a streak of jealousy. 

None of these are huge problems, but he shares none of these problems with Jess or Dean (except Dean being a cheater. That's why I'm team Jess). ",7,6,False,self,,,,,

I absolutely still hate that after being shown and told multiple times in the OS that she is different from her mother only to end up like her is a tough pill to swallow. 

With that said, after watching it again and taking my time with it I have come to see it in a more positive light. Once I chose to ignore all that is Rory, I was able to focus on the other characters and found myself once again charmed by these people. I loved Emily, she finally became a person to me. And while this revival doesn't change the many horrible things she did in the OS, I do have a newly found love for her.

 Luke is still the same and for that I am very happy because I always found him to be a flawed but kind and thoughtful man. His speech to Lorelai was absolutely beautiful and I loved it. I still hate his hair piece though. 

The townspeople are the same as I remembered but I wasn't too fond of the new guy that was outspoken in the meetings. I LOVE Kirk. 

The cameos were over the top and unnecessary and I felt that time could have been used for other more important things. 

Lorelai oh Lorelai. She hasn't changed or matured much and the whole Wild hiking thing was beyond out of character and I find it pathetic that to find a story of your dad (albeit well acted and heartbreaking) she needed to go look at the mountains. With that said, her scenes with Emily were amazing and I felt her pain. I don't like that once again SHE is the one picking the date for the wedding. Everything in their relationship seems to be about her and I still don't like that.

Overall my second viewing was much more enjoyable and I found myself crying and laughing, something I didn't have with the first viewing. Winter and Fall were the most GG of the revival episodes, Spring and Summer were ok but the fat jokes, the cheating, that musical etc just could have done without.

By no means an expert on the subject outside of family members who have suffered from AD and general dementia, but these were the scenes where Emily seemed to show the early signs:
- Richard's painting unveiling in Winter (implied in the scene that she wrote down dimensions much larger than intended)
- DAR scene in Fall (wandering mid-interview to the refreshments table; significant personality change/irritability in calling the DAR's 'bullshit')
- Dinner scene with Luke/Lorelei/Rory in Spring (Emily returned from the foyer stating that Rory 'wasn't invited either,' but was then gently reminded by Rory that E had agreed to let R stay due to the Chilton alumni event the next day)
- Ending therapy without telling Lorelei
- Conversation with Jack in Nantucket in Fall (Jack: I've got some bad news.' Emily: 'Lobster is fine.' Jack's reaction shows this was not a logical response to his statement)

I wasn't planning on binging the entire revival or ever posting in this subreddit, but my best friend is visiting and we stayed up last night watching all of the new episodes.

I guess my brain wasn't happy with the ending because I ended up dreaming an epilogue and I thought maybe some of you may enjoy reading it. 

Full disclosure: I lean Team Jess, but I like(d) Logan. I didn't enjoy how they were trying to make him like Christopher in the revival. For the most part, I honestly liked the revival. The only thing I hated was how the portrayed therapy. I've been to therapy - specifically couple's therapy - and I'm not ashamed to say it because of how amazing my experience was.

It was almost Christmas. Luke and Lorelai were staying in this house they rented along the beach. It could have been Emily's Nantucket house, but for some reason I don't remember her being there. Sookie and the new Inn chef were in the kitchen, Lorelai was attempting to help, and Luke was doing last minute maintenance around the house. It was busy, but not everyone had arrived yet. A bus pulls up to the house and Jess comes out. For some reason there are also a lot of foster kids running around the yard. I'm not sure why.

Then Rory and her 5 year old daughter walk up and are greeted by a chaotic house, but in a good family-style kind of way. Logan isn't there and Rory and Jess are clearly not together, but they make eyes across the room alluding to the fact that they've gotten over the initial shock of Rory having a child now.

Everyone goes outside and gathers around this giant tree in the yard. There's a rope so kids take turns swinging on it while the parents laugh and catch up. Eventually the adults start to have their fun on the rope as well. There was no real ""final"" ending to my dream after this, but I like the idea of everyone together, laughing, and having a good time as a family.

1211,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2016-11-27,2016,11,27,3,5f0rp4,self.GilmoreGirls,I know a lot of you don't like Rory... (Spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5f0rp4/i_know_a_lot_of_you_dont_like_rory_spoilers/,readerthatiscurious,1480184702,"but I personally feel that while, no she is not any morally high individual, she is just another person living her life, and she makes mistakes in it, but she is not a bad person. This is my personal take on it:

Financially: Yes she is 32, but if you remember, it was mentioned at the beginning of AYITL that her former lease wasn't available anymore (can't remember exactly why). Anyways, as someone who has extremely close friends with similar relationships as Rory to Lorelai/Paris/Logan/Lane, it doesn't strike me at all weird that the is ""mooching"" off of them. I know any of my friends, myself included, would be completely fine with our friends doing so, especially if we already have more money than we can spend anyways. She is trying to figure out what she wants her future to be like, and she as she puts she'll probably never have the chance to not have a permanent address again in her life. And I think the whole point of the SandeeSays debacle was to show that she was willing to take jobs she didn't want as long as they were in the field of what she loved (writing). In terms of the baby, I thought that what her conversation with Christopher was hinting at (if there is no sequel/AYITLseason2) is that Rory is deciding if she wants to raise the baby alone or with Logan. IMHO, I think that, with the result of the conversation, it is implied that she's going to at least try to raise the baby alone.
Onto the Relationship: I think it's important to remember the differences between her cheating with Dean and her cheating with Logan. First of all, we don't really know how her whole arrangement with Logan started, but we saw what happened with Dean. That being said, it doesn't make it right. Yes, it was wrong that she cheated on Paul but when she mentions how she literally cannot remember that she is in a relationship with him, it's not really her fault. That sounds wrong, but let me explain with an example. I am a college student right now at one of the largest public universities in the US, and I have a randomly assigned roommate. Let's say she asks me to not lock the door when I leave, and I say okay. Then, I completely forget about this conversation, so I end up locking the door. Now, was what I did wrong? Yes, but it wasn't done with malicious intent. She cheats on Paul not because she wants to hurt him, but because she literally forgets that he exists (and is her boyfriend) most of the time. Onto the Odette part of the relationship, we don't know how Logan got engaged to Odette in the first place. IMO, throughout AYITL, we see Logan still loving Rory. So, I would need more details about that, but I think the point of that relationship is it's hard to say no when someone you love who loves you back woos you so hard, even if it's not the right thing to do. I agree that she didn't really learn from the first time though.
Bottom Line: I agree that she hasn't learned that much in the past 10 years, but I think her positive points in addition to both her flaws are present more than before. As we age, we all tend to come into ourselves more, and who we become becomes a more solid thing as opposed to more leaning when we are younger. Logan has to be the father logistically speaking because if it was the Wookie, then she would have been at 6 months- 8 months pregnant by the time she told Lorelai. And she didn't just think the one night stand was the issue, she thought the whole thing was the issue too. This is shown when she was complaining about her ""love life"" and tells Lorelai about how it sucks and has problems.
About Lorelai's reaction to the book: To her, Lorelai's reaction wasn't natural. I know for me, when I build up this idea in my head that someone will absolutely love something, and then they respond to it with a no, I'm absolutely crushed because I don't understand exactly how they can think that or why they think that, so I react with confusion too. About the rage thing, I know plenty of people that rant to their friends after a not super happy conversation with their mother. Also, just a thought. I am currently a creative writing major with hopes of writing books or editing once I graduate. If I were ever to write a book about MY life and MY relationship with the people in it, then I don't really think I would need my parents' approval to write about it since it is my life. Like someone else said, ideally this would be the situation, but it's my life, so I am allowed to right about it.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

I have realized that I pretty much liked everything about it except Rory's storyline which was a world of no.

I think Rorys story in the revival should have picked up with her going through a divorce.  The guy she married was great but Rory doesn't want to sacrifice her career for a baby, and her husband is wanting children and has waited on her for 4 years to ""be ready"" but he can't wait any longer and they divorce.  She decides to take a hiatus from her job and since they have to split everything in the divorce she moves to Stars Hollow where her support system is while their house sells.  

While she's in Starts Hollow she gets in a depressed funk and hits writers block and has to explore the reasons why her marriage failed and really explore whether she wants to sacrifice her goals of having children for her career and of course this is why her marriage failed. 

I think this would have been more fitting scenario for Rory's stage of life.  I am 30 years old and went through the same ""figuring out who you are are stages that Rory went through in high school and college"" and I think they should have paralleled with her viewers and where we are in our lives.  

And of course Jess was there to pull her out of her funk and realize that she should write a book.  But Jess was already happily married with a kid on the way and he talks to Rory about how excited he is to be a father and how meaningful it is.  This also helps Rory decide that she does want children after all.

And Rory realizes that her marriage failed in part because she kept thinking that she couldn't do both have a career and children.  She realizes that she CAN have both.  She reconciles with her estranged super handsome husband and make a baby.

I think then, she should have made a conscious decision to become pregnant and that would make the last four words resolve the major conflict in her current stage of life while also mirroring what many of us who went through everything else with her are going through.  Much more relatable than this same 16 year old Rory crisis she had again in the revival.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I think the LDB boys will make consistent appearances, perhaps even be the new main ""Stars Hollow"" cast.  We'll watch Colin and Finn become actual men.  Still holding out for Gorilla Girl to return as a true friend for Rory.  Such a missed opportunity in the OS.

Lane would obviously be a regular member.  Maybe they'll even cast the kids and start making them be role models for Rory's baby.  Maybe Lane will even have another one so they'll have a kid the same age.

I think (I know you guys hate her but she's a great actress despite her sorry plotline for existing) April will have a recurring role of needing Rory as an ""Aunt"" to look up to.  She'll essentially be the new Rory. 

Lorelai and Luke and Emily will have recurring appearances.  Especially since they don't have regular shows now.  It's almost like they freed up their schedules to continue GG work?  Hmmmm.

Once Rory is done with her book deal and tour, she'll settle in at Chilton as a teacher.

As someone who finish rewatching the OS and immediately jumped to the revival, I thought Lauren Graham's transition to Lorelai is almost seamless. I wouldn't even think there's almost 10 years between the end of season 7 and the start of the revival because Lorelai was just as quick and witty as ever. Lorelai was still immature, yes, but I was so happy about that. We first see her at 32, already an adult, so I would have been upset if they'd given her random character development into her adult years. 

She also nailed any emotional scenes. Her describing her favorite birthday had me in tears (as did a lot of things during the revival lol).

Thematically yes there are parallels, but a parallel doesn't mean ""exact duplicate"".

Lorelai was homeless, penniless, with no support system. Does any of that describe Rory in the finale? Not really. She has a place to live. She has family money (if Richard left Luke something in his will, there's no way Rory was passed over). She has a strong family support network in Lorelai, Emily, and Luke.

As for Logan, yes there were definite Christopher parallels. But again, not the same thing. Chris was 16, Logan is 35. That is such a huge difference in life stages that even comparing those two characters is laughable (Chris left Rory, so Logan will leave Rory's baby). Did anyone watch the revival and not think that Logan and Rory were completely in love with each other? Would the Logan in the revival be a deadbeat dad? It seems highly, highly improbable. (Nor would Lorelai, Luke, etc. let Rory get away with her not telling him at all.)

I'm seeing a lot of ""Jess is Rory's Luke"". Which if you think about it, is quite bleak for Jess. He gets to (like his uncle) secretly pine for Rory for 20 years while she raises another man's child? It's even worse for Jess, since he would know the baby from birth, and it's the baby of a man he's disliked since they met.

The ending wasn't a totally happy one for Rory, but it's far from the dystopian nightmare some to think it is (that she repeated all her mother's mistakes and is doomed to be a single mom with a deadbeat baby daddy). She's rich, she's beloved by family, and Logan is nuts about her.

A true ""full circle"" would have been a much grimmer picture.

If she was intending for Rory to have his kid but on her own. Was she going to find a good way to break them up? Was she definitely going to break them up? Would she have offered Logan some type of job opportunity far away that would make Rory not want to ruin that for them? 

I think it's odd that she was planning on doing this all along because it seems like it would have been more jarring in the original series given all of time she spent developing Logan's character. 

And then even now, why did we need to see that Rory and Logan were functionally a couple, rather than showing that Rory accidentally hooked up with him once or twice? That would have been far more like Chris and Lorelai, because the biggest way Logan is not like Chris is the fact that he is there for Rory day in and day out. 

I also feel like ASP was trying to have her cake and eat it to by making Logan seem like such a good guy but also make him Rory's deadbeat dad. And IMO the bad guy stuff felt incredibly forced. 

Not to mention the fact that I can't believe that ASP wanted Rory to have a kid at 23. At 32, I can see the merit in it, but now we know that is asp had ended things we wouldn't have gotten Rory going off to focus on building a career. And how is the theme of the show not Rory having a different life than her mother? And again at 32 I could see her coming back around to it, but we are supposed to believe that Rory would go further than Lorelai, she'd get that education, she'd show her skills in the newsroom, and then she'd have to put all of that on the back burner shortly after graduating for something she seems to have zero interest in.

I know a lot of people didnt like it. I however thought it was lovely.

Heres the thing. It has been always about a mother and a daughter. I agree with that sentiment. But as adults, its not as simple as mother and daughter. Were more defined by our career or lack thereof, by our romantic relationships, and what we decide to spend our time doing. My mother and I are still mother and daughter, I still adore the shit out of her and her of me, but heres the thing: our relationship is not as simple as it was when I was a kid.

Lorelai and Luke were always the correct choice. 

Rory being single/rather ending up single makes sense. Weve all picked our favorite boyfriend of hers, but she is an independent woman. Its never supposed to have been about whatever man she was with, I get that for most of the revival, she is having an affair. But in the show, she is a real human being with real feelings and real levels of attachment. And her realization that she needs to move on from Logan was character development which we all have to experience as human beings/adults. 

But I agree overall that she doesn't seem to have learned a thing in 10 years. She does seem to think she is entitled and throws away others' emotions. But to be honest, based on her family life and how big of a difference her grandparents' wealth was from her mother's, it kind of makes sense how she ended up that way? Maybe?

Also, Lorelai going all Wild on us makes sense in a weird sort of way. I saw the movie Wild with my mom and thought of it as an intensive mother-daughter/womanhood story. What better show than the show about the Gilmore Girls to go all Wild on us?

I also lost my Grandpa a couple of months ago and have watched my mother and grandmother and myself, really, go through similar experiences as their family.

Just my two cents. I think the story is cathartic in a way I needed it to be, as an adult woman who grew up with Rory and sort of Lorelai too

The Christopher/Logan and Luke/Jess parallels - I kind of get it. I can get behind that. I don't even feel sorry for Rory - she had every opportunity available to her and made poor choices. 

I know we sometimes criticize Lorelai and give her a lot of grief, but looking at Rory and realizing that at her age Lorelai was raising a teenage girl really put things in perspective for me. At Rory's age, Lorelai was running an inn, raising a bright teenage daughter, and doing whatever it took for her daughter to have a great education and ""not end up like her."" She put her dating life on hold or at least did not bring it home with her. She worked incredibly hard at her job and had a goal of opening her own inn.

The revival gave me a greater appreciation for Lorelai and the sacrifices she made and made me feel sad that all of her effort might have been in vain. I keep thinking back to the moment Rory first slept with Dean - the disappointment and shock on Lorelai's face and the disbelief. This was not who she had raised Rory to be. It happened again when Rory dropped out of Yale. It happened again in the revival when Rory told Lorelai about how she's been sleeping with Logan in London. It happened again when Rory told her she was pregnant.

Rory being pregnant isn't the end of the world and I actually kind of like the full-circle single mother ending. I just wish that all of the hard work and effort Lorelai had put in had paid off in some way. For all her education and love and support from her family, Rory is still floundering in her career and love life. At her age, Lorelai without a high-school diploma or support from her family, was raising a child and advancing in her career. This doesn't seem full-circle - it feels like we took ten steps back.

It would have been nice if Lorelai and Luke had been hitched and had a little one, though I can understand how having a new, very important character in the show would be awkward.   I can accept that Luke and Lorelai decided not to.  The revival certainly didn't care much for including child characters (Lane's and Paris's kids felt more like quiet, moving pictures than actual kids with personalities!). But Lorelai and Luke could have had an interesting story arc even if they were already married.  Even if their communication had been breaking down a bit in recent times, I just don't see how these two would never have brought up marriage or kids again since we saw them last in S7.  

Doing all this in 2016 felt too false and forced.  It made me sad.

She then reconnects with Logan who is also old and residing in London. Rory get's to have the life and love she never had with Logan, so she moves to London. There they live out the rest of their lives together till death.

I don't think it plays as Logan as Christopher or Jess as Luke. But both of them are great loves. One who represents her dreams  she couldn't realise with Logan, the other new dreams with Jess.

Anyway, revival was cute. It was nice to see all those lovely characters. At the same time I felt that the show was just a reunion, that the story was going nowhere. Again pointless drama (that we witnessed in previous seasons).

I hated that moment when Lorelai was supposed to tell a nice story about her father, but instead she was a drama queen who decided to bitch about her father. I know she panicked, but I expected her to be more mature,  wiser or whatever. She remained the same person with the same problems through every season. I like her personality, but sometimes her reactions in serious situations are lame. The beginning of that scene, when Lorelai was asleep was hilarious though.

Michel's joke about Xanax being invented for Lorelai might be true. 

Have you noticed that Lorelai was changing cooks in every episode? Did that remind you of Emily, who used to change her maids very often? Funny, how Emily decided to keep that maid who spoke some apparently unknown  language or whatever.


Rory... She is human who is allowed to make mistakes, but sometimes I don't understand her and have to judge her. Being with a guy that has  a fiancee. I didn't like that. The show only showed how Logan is stuck in his college years and still wanting fun and to party. He is engaged, his male friends know that, but it was shown like it was fine that he spends his time with his ""mistress"" while his friends approve that. Rory made a big mistake, but it also showed that Logan was a bad choice for her. And thank God she didn't want to marry him. The guy is a man-whore from a spoiled rich male society that acts the same.
Rory knew about Logan being engaged from the start, but later she acted like she just found out and that bothered her. Seriously? 

Good side was that Emily was finally shown as a person who wants to focus on the people she like and her happiness, instead of thinking about her social status. Finally, the relationship between her and Lorelai was great in the last episode. Although, I wanted happy end for Rory (a guy, great job at some known magazine), it was good and realistic.

It was weird to see changes of some actors and actresses like Liz Torres  (Patty). David Sutcliffe (Christopher) was the same. Melissa seemed different, her voice too. Lauren's face seemed botoxed. lol


p.s. Rory said she was pregnant. Is Logan the father? I hate cliffhangers. Does this mean there is a possibility for more special episodes?

I don't think any improvement happened. 

At the funeral, I can understand while Emily was mad, but at the same time, she was vile to Lorelai. She went too far in what she was spilling out. I felt terrible for Lorelai. I could also relate because it's hard being put on the spot like that. 

I've been to a funeral before and I even had a story to tell before hand, just in case, and when put on the spot, my brain still froze and I stumbled over my words trying to get through it. And on top of that Lorelai also had many drinks that night and was kind of in a slumber mood. It just showed again, that Emily never forgets anything Lorelai does and can't let it go. 

Which brings up my next point. I loved that they went to therapy together. It went how I thought it would go. In one of the therapy sessions, Emily starts to bring up Lorelai's pregnancy and Lorelai is baffled at why she is bringing it up, saying it is ancient history. Rory is in her 30's and after all this time, Emily still hasn't let it go and the other stuff that is ancient history. So for 30+ years, Emily still holds onto these hurts, she feels Lorelai has done to her. 

The one that disgusted me the most, is the way she treated and talked about Luke. There are plenty of people who don't get married and they are committed couples. Just like, there are married people who don't act like committed couples. I loved that the therapist told Lorelai that.

Don't get me wrong, I loved that they got married, but it's what they wanted and what Lorelai wanted and she wasn't pushed into it. She and Luke were able to get the perfect marriage. 

I'm happy that Lorelai stayed and went to therapy alone, it was obvious to see that she was struggling. Not just with her dad's death and Emily but in other aspects of life. I loved that the ""hike"" was able to give her the clarity she needed. 

The phone call to Emily was sad, vulnerable, and I""m glad she called Emily to tell her about it. But the only thing that I could think of is that, once again, it was Lorelai who extended that olive branch out to Emily to try and patch their relationship. 

I didn't expect the therapy lessons to make everything perfect or fix everything, but maybe to get Emily to see that she should start letting some of the things she holds over Lorelai's head go. That she needs to release things like Lorelai's pregnancy and what happened.

It was obvious that Emily brought Lorelai there because she thought the therapist would work on Lorelai and get her to ""admit"" the way she has wrong Emily. But it doesn't work like that, therapy is a two-way streets with both parties finally realizing how they've been treating each other. 

It makes me wonder about the letter Emily was talking about. The one she claims Lorelai wrote about with the vile words. If the letter did happen, it had to be before Rory was born, because Lorelai left home after that and they barely had any contact with them, except holidays. If it was during the show run, we would of heard about it. So, it would of had to of been when Lorelai was a teenager or younger. 

Anyways, I was just sad that we didn't get to see any improvements of the Emily/Lorelai relationship, not even a tiny one. I loved how both Emily and Lorelai's went through there own journeys and figured out things about themselves. Their acting from both of them was superb and other posts discuss both of their grieving process. They both deserve some kind of reward because you could literally see and feel the emotions they were putting out. 

I do like where they both ended up, even if they still are stuck in the same loop they've always been in. The loaning of money at the end, kind of shows it, with Emily being afraid that strings attached won't keep Lorelai in her life.

I came on here expecting some great discussion about the episodes and I'm shocked at all the negative team this/that reactions! 

I for one loved AYITL. Of course it had its weak spots, I could have done without as much of the Logan affair LDB stuff (although visually it was beautiful) but overall I thought it was a fitting return. Lauren Graham is an absolute powerhouse &amp; deserves an Emmy, as does Kelly Bishop and Alexis in her own understated was great too, I thought comedically she was great in some moments. 

I agree with others, I found Rory's storyline a little middling but I loved her writing the book (""lose the 'the' "" = me in tears!) and thought her pregnancy although a little predictable, at least for die hard fans, was an interesting and touching conclusion (or lack thereof?) to the series. 

I loved the Luke &amp; Lorelai conclusion, the wedding was perfect, but again the whole having kids thing kind of went nowhere, I would've liked to see some growth or real discussion there. I understand people saying they haven't grown much because they still have trouble communicating, but I think that's kind of their own dysfunctional way of doing things, it works for them because they're made for each other. They at least have made progression by the end after Lorelai's revelatory trip &amp; Luke finally  verbalising his feelings. They finally got married guys!

Emily's story was great too, I teared up when I saw her working at the museum finally being an independent, working woman. The parallels between her and Lorelai were lovely. And I loved their sweet moment too, it was just right for them, nothing huge but an understanding of love between them. 

Overall, it wasn't perfect and there were weak moments for sure, but it seems like people were putting insurmountable pressure on these four episodes. I I think Amy and Dan did a good job. I feel it was a perfect little visit back to Stars Hollow and these characters. 

Oh, and I loved the musical! I thought it was hilarious and perfectly weird and quirky but with pathos, something GG does so well. That final song with the reaction from Lorelai had me in tears. And I love Sutton Foster so it was great to see/hear her do her thing. 

I found Spring the weakest episode I think, just for the Rory stuff in it but it had some classic moments so I can't fault it too much. 

That's my instant reaction and all I can think of in brief but would love to hear others' opinions!

This is something I quickly came up with that I think would have been way more fitting for the series, its tone, and its characters.

WINTER

Picks up right after Richards funeral. Rory is back in town for the funeral and decides to spend some time there afterwards. Everyone is really proud of her for all the famous outlets shes written for, but we get the idea something is bothering her. Meanwhile, Luke and Lorelei have been perfectly happy together for the past eight years, but lately people have been questioning why they arent married and its starting to get on their nerves. To make matters worse, Lorelei has a pregnancy scare. When she confronts Luke with this possibility, the two fight. But by the end of the episode they find the scare was just a false alarm. The two are relieved, make up, and in their relief decide theyll get married and set a date for later next year. Lorelei explains what happened to Rory but can still tell something is bothering her and ventures a guess that things arent going so well with her career despite her previous success. Rory admits this is true, but after Lorelei leaves, Rory returns to her room where one of the pregnancy tests her mom bought in a panic earlier in the week reveals that Rory is pregnant though were not sure who the father is.

SPRING

Rory is chasing more leads on permanent writing positions as shes grown very tired of all the traveling and job insecurity. She has lofty goals to write at a prestigious outlet but it just isnt working out. While in London, she has a tough interview that doesnt work out. Afterwards, she pulls out her phone and calls someone asking if she can come over. In her next scene, its clear shes just had sex with someone in a nice apartment. Shes getting dressed when its revealed to the audience that its Logan. Its made clear to the audience that Logan is the father of Rorys child, but before she can tell him, Rory finds out that Logan is recently engaged. Rory doesnt want to repeat what happened with her and Dean and runs away without telling Logan about the baby. Meanwhile, Emily is struggling without Richard in her life. Shes becoming increasingly cruel to Lorelei, Luke, and the help and wastefully spending tons of money. Lorelei has to take time off work and away from Luke when she finally convinces her mother to attend therapy on the condition that Lorelei goes with her. This puts a strain on Michel at the Dragonfly and Luke at home who is left to plan the wedding alone, something hes not thrilled about at all. Rory is growing increasingly agitated at her situation by the time she returns home and angrily snaps at some of Stars Hollows quirky residents. Shes coming to resent the town as her lofty goals are collapsing around her, but when she decides to immediately fly back to London, her credit card is declined. Rory is broke and stuck in Connecticut.

SUMMER

Rory takes up the editor position at the Stars Hollow Gazette to make ends meet and because she has a soft spot for the paper, but she again butts heads with the town when she tries to make what would be otherwise sensible changes to any other towns newspaper. Her pregnancy is starting to show, and people are starting to broach the subject, but it isnt until Lorelei returns home and immediately realizes whats going on that Rory admits the truth. Meanwhile, Rorys workload is stressing her out so shes seeks the help of some of her old friends to contribute writing including Jess. She opens up to him about her feelings of failure and he recommends that she write a book about Stars Hollow saying theres no place quite like it. The two quickly get reacquainted over the phone, but when she and Jess finally meet up in person later, hes taken aback to find her pregnant. He only grows more distant when he finds out the baby is for Logan and that hes engaged. Meanwhile, Lorelei returns home to find Michel and Luke both stressed out and accidentally taking their anger out on her for all the work she inadvertently piled on their shoulders when she left for therapy. Things dont look good for her until she reveals what happened at therapy. Emily has only gotten worse and said some extremely hurtful things to Lorelei forcing her to quit and return home. Luke apologizes and reveals that despite not feeling comfortable with it and being over worked, he did an amazing job planning the wedding (with some humorous help from Kirk and many other Stars Hollow residents.) Sookie also finally returns from helping some famous chef open up a restaurant theyre partners in and says shell help out in Loreleis stead while she catches up with Luke and the wedding.

FALL

The wedding is approaching and the entire town has turned the event into the largest Stars Hollow has ever seen. It isnt until the week before the wedding that Lorelei finds out that Luke doesnt have a best man. She suggests Jess and when he arrives in town, he apologizes to Rory for leaving her the way he did explaining that he thought things were finally going to work out for the two of them together only to think that he had lost his chance for good. Rory reveals that shes written a first draft the book Jess suggested and he says its fantastic. Meanwhile, Lorelei is upset that her mom never reconciled with her. But just before the ceremony, Emily arrives taking Lorelei aside and specifically apologizing for all of her misdeeds in their relationship, including some that Lorelei couldnt even remember. She says that she was often jealous of Lorelei in some ways because shes the kind of woman she wishes she could have been sometimes. Lorelei says the same to her and that its not too late for either of them. The wedding is better than any of them could have expected. At the reception, Rory and Jess are dancing when he tells her that the press he works for is going to publish the book and that a larger publisher they know read a copy he sent them and they want to meet with her soon. The two kiss. Luke and Lorelei stop over to say goodbye and that theyre leaving for their honeymoon but theyll be back for Rorys due date, but Rory goes into labor then and there. At the hospital, Logan shows up. Its revealed that Rory told him about the baby and that shes keeping it. He says hes willing to leave his fianc for her but Rory doesnt want that. She says everything worked out for her and itll work out for their child. Later in the final scene, Lorelei enters the room to find Rory holding her baby, a girl. She asks what she decided to name her daughter to which Rory says: ""Her name is Lorelei.""

---

The revival had the difficulty of needing to give Lorelei a conflict despite having all of her issues neatly resolved at the end of the series. Instead of contrived arguments with Emily and Luke, I thought it would have been better to have a main goal she's working toward (a wedding) and have issues naturally affect her life in difficult ways (the fallout from her father's death and the effect it has on her mother bringing down Lorelei's work and romantic life.)

Meanwhile, I feel like it makes sense for Rory to have one of those ""the answer is staring you in the face the entire time"" arcs where she was missing the forest for the trees due to her lofty goals and early successes. She constantly thinks she needs to be somewhere big like New York when it's been Star's Hollow all along. And while I put her more toward Jess and away from Logan, you can rewrite it however you want. This was just my personal take. The important part is that, while realistic that she might struggle in her life, she learned from her past mistakes and didn't become a horrible person like she did in the revival.

As for Emily, I feel like while she changed in the revival, she never seemed to acknowledged quite how horrible she was to Lorelei. I thought this should end by it being clear that despite their troubled past, these two love each other and are genuinely sorry for the way they treated each other at times.

Most importantly, I feel like restructuring the story this way gives each episode a significant amount of plot, intrigue, conflict, and momentum without deviating from what the original series was all about. The revival we got was dark and bitter and seemed to be dripping with contempt for the fans and people who worked on the show previously. I feel like fans deserve something closer to this idea than what they got.",26,47,False,self,,,,,

'It is not heroes that make history, but history that makes heroes.'

'Those who vote decide nothing. Those who count the vote decide everything.'

'I believe in only one thing- the power of human will.'

In addition, given the Huntzberger family's high profile, Logan and Odette's engagement would have been announced to the world at large. Rory publicly revealing her pregnancy would make Logan and her the talk of the town, exacerbated in the age of social media. So I think the fallout from Rory's baby would be a lot worse than Lorelai's.

I wonder if Emily keeping Berta for so long compared to her previous maids is because she was shell-shocked at first from Richard's death, or she finally realised how hard she was on the help. But I did not care for the many strangers/ Berta's family that Emily allowed into her house. Was it because she couldn't stand being alone? Two or three people is fine, but there seemed to be a horde in almost every scene.

With that said. I actually enjoyed the revival. Though there were some things that seemed out of place like Lorelei's trip and the whole Paris part, I think in the end it was all needed for the show. 

Rory's whole part was not what I expected. In the original series I needed up not really liking her. She became too selfish and hard headed (more than her mother). In the revival she seemed even worse. Cheating on her bf ""Paul?"" And with Logan  then becoming pregnant w/his baby. It was all too much for me. 

I really like the idea of her writing the book. I must admit it made me tear up a little. And all in all I see what they were trying to do. (A whole full circle idea) 

My question however is, when Rory goes to see Christopher and asks though a seemingly random and out of place questions. Do you think that she already knew she was pregnant and was seeing how her father thought about how she was raised?  
Do you think that she was already thinking that she's not going to tell Logan about the baby? Just a question

Emily built her identity on Richard and didn't know what to do without him. We knew that from the trailer. She mopes. Which is acceptable, but it's like 80% of her plot line. She pushes her daughter away. She tries therapy and it doesn't work. Nothing happens. She becomes a *little* more like a person, but it took *that* long at like 70 to discover you haven't liked your life and lived so much of it as a snob for the sake of your husband? Ooookay. The whole Nantucket things is nice, but realistically you're like 70 at this point and moving *away* from your family and friends and house and any semblance of a support system? Not realistic, but I guess they get points for a decent story.

Lorelai and Luke have terrible communication and that's on *both* of them. If Luke didn't like the way things were going that was on him to bring it up. And he did, after being grumpy forever. And then he contradicted himself about it mattering in the last episode. And if she wanted to get married she should have proposed again without having to go on a hike. Lorelai gets a bit of a pass because her father died, Suki left and Michel was showing clear signs of leaving, so I get that she might have been feeling lonely and needing to connect, but then *tell him*. Also, yeah, just hire a cook to stop inconveniencing your boyfriend. If you go through a million cooks, that's not nice to the employees, but stop being a burden maybe and have another cook lined up before you fire the former.

And Rory. Ugh, Rory. She cheats on her boyfriend with Logan who cheats on his fiance with her. Also, poor Paul. You're a Yale graduate and you can't find work? Why not at McDonalds or something similar while you figure life out? Why *not* go for your masters if you rely on everyone else for rent and food and they're happy to do it even while you mope? Even her idea to write a book was given to her. And honestly, just the vanity in writing a book when your life is so uninteresting is just so empty. And the whole ""a character in a story writes a story to overcome their problems"" is such a cop out. No, that's not how you solve your problems in life. Sure, write for you if you want to write, be creative or artsy, but it's for personal growth and not for the progression of you career if you're writing without the consent of the people it might affect. It's a violation of her mother's privacy. Her mother gave her everything. Friendship, a good upbringing, books, she went to her parents for money for Chilton. She was prepared to forgo her dream of opening an inn to pay for Yale until Rory promised Friday night dinners. She asks, please don't, and she writes anyway. And then Lorelai still relents and agrees. The whole ""I'm pregnant"" ending kind of sucked too. You could tell as soon as she talked to Christopher. 

And, so... what? You're going to have a kid when you haven't had a job for a year? I mean. Rory is just not a responsible person. The best thing about her is that she's smart. She's not loyal or kind or hard working at this point in her life. Her boyfriends bail her out of everything. Realistically, it works out for her because her grandmother will die and leave her money, or Logan will send decent child support cheques. Or she could do the whole martyr thing and not even tell him he has a kid. Or the book could make her money but that's so cliche.

Mitchum told her in the most terrible way possible that she didn't have what it takes to be a journalist.

Jess also questioned Rory's chosen career path the night they go for ice cream. He is far gentler and helps her with that goal when he sees it's what she wants. He gently questions the decision.

I feel that jess has always known Rory was meant to be a writer. He's helped her be her real self. He always gets through to her. And he knows how to do that so well. 

When Rory was with Logan and left Yale she became a very scary version of Emily. Emily clearly only lived her life the way she did because of Richard. She chose a very different life for herself after he passed away. Emily truly became who she is - the same person as who her daughter and granddaughter are. 

Emily chose the rich guy and led an unfulfilling life (but she definitely loved Richard and was devoted to him). Lorelai did the opposite and ended up with the guy she nearly three decades later - not the rich guy. The question for Rory is now which choice does she make?",5,13,False,self,,,,,

""She's 32,"" we say, ""she should be more mature and not having an affair and living out of boxes and have no career!"" We expected her to be further along in her life, 10 years after we last saw her. Even Lorelai, we thought, should have had it more together - should have talked about kids with her partnet, should have already married Luke, should not be drifting through her own life.

But I think I've realized something that is going to make me appreciate the Revival so much more once I re-watch it. Something that Emily's story made me realize. 

We watched Emily ""get her life together"" in the Revival. At the beginning she was in shambles, reeling after the death of Richard and the total 180 that her life had suddenly taken; at the end she had found a new path, new things to fulfill her, a ""new life"" that she had never had before. 

Gilmore girls, the Revival and even the OS, shows that life and success and ""getting it together"" aren't linear. Things get built up, and things get torn down, and things get built up again. You may still find yourself ""getting your life together"" at 75. 

And maybe that's okay. Because that's what life is. It's finding yourself not once, but over and over again.

I think that this idea makes me appreciate the whole series, Revival and OS, so much more. This was never a show about watching the characters figure it all out or finally put all the pieces together; it is a show about the journey.

First, some background about me...

I am a 30 year old woman who began watching Gilmore Girls as a sophomore in high school. I literally grew up with Rory &amp; Lorelai as my ""guides"" - and this show helped me to shape so much of my world and to navigate the relationship I had with my own very Emily-esque mother, and to find peace in my life. I was heartbroken when the original show ended - I was part of the yellow daisy campaign, holding on to all my hope that GG would come back with ASP at the reigns. The show had taken a turn after season 6 and been yanked from it's intended trajectory when ASP left, so I already felt angry about season 7 and what the network had done to ASP and my beautiful show...and then when it was announced that season 7 was to be the end...the heartbreak really set in. I cried for weeks, maybe months on and off. This story was so much bigger than network conflicts...it was a true story, a modern classic novel in television format, and it felt as though we diehard fans would be forever doomed to have read all but the last book in this series we had become so invested in and influenced by.

So, after waiting almost a decade thinking that I would never know how the show was supposed to end...thinking that I would never know what ASP had planned for the REAL season 7 and beyond...AYITL has just happened. 

And the more I replay AYITL in my mind...the clearer my understanding of the intentions of the original show become. And although ASP has acknowledged that she couldn't completely ignore the ""official"" seventh season, and thus did some writing around it so that there would be a sense of continuity...what I have come to believe is that you have to think of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life in terms of what was supposed to happen when the show abruptly ended all those years ago... as, for all intents and purposes, a ""re-do"" of season 7.
 
The infamous 7th season was NEVER supposed to happen - that was not ASP's writing at all! So the story is becoming clearer now, as we all use this ""revival"" to piece together how the show was intended to wrap up almost a decade ago. 

Some interesting questions are sparked, though...for instance, (SPOILERS) if ASP had continued on with GG for the original season 7 (and apparently a season 8 was planned as well)...and if Lorelai's character had been younger than she is now in the revival...would she have had Luke &amp; Lorelai get pregnant? Or would Rory &amp; (presumably) Logan's baby be their new ""kid""? 

And...would Logan really have gotten engaged to someone else? Or would it have been a matter of Rory wanting to stay true to herself and not become a married woman so young...and thereby choosing to raise the baby on her own so she could still pursue her own career and identity? 

I think it is also clear that certain parallels of Lorelai's life were intended from the start, and these parallels indicate what Rory's future will be...with Logan being Rory's ""Christopher"", and Jess being Rory's ""Luke"". It's the meaning of the phrase ""full circle"" that Lorelai uses so often in the revival. 

The more I think about Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life, the more clear my understanding of the show's original intentions become. 

The more I think of this show as a ""re-do"" of the seventh season, the more I understand the real meaning of the story as a whole. And although I understand that the final four words could be seen as a completion of the story, they are also so utterly open-ended that the story could legitimately go on unfolding from here. So I guess we will wait and see if there will be more to come. But as it stands, I am so happy that this story that was so important to me growing up has finally gotten it's due, and that we diehard fans finally know the real trajectory of the story that meant so much to us.",1,5,False,self,,,,,

It was a complete retcon. It was basically ASP tossing season 7 and acting like it never happened, except for acknowledging the Lorelai-Chris marriage (and even then, she had to throw a 'Take that': ""it wasnt supposed to happen""). Ironically enough, Lorelai getting with Christopher temporarily was probably the only thing the writers of season 7 ""got right"", even though that was basically the only thing I hated in that season and why I thought season 7 was awful.
Welp, the revival made me realise it wasn't as awful as I thought, and I'm going ahead and give credit to the writers who came up with a way to resolve and tie the bow beautifully. Because now I appreciate season 7's end. I can definitely that say now in retrospect that I like season 7 and the way it ended on such a positive and open and bright note.

But that wasn't what ASP wanted, that's not what she had in mind and you could see it happening in season 6, but really, from the get-go you could tell what she was trying to do, except, with season 7, she never got to do it. Now with the revival, she's treating season 7 as what it's actually supposed to be; basically a fanfiction alternative ending. Because this revival, friends, was the true continuation to season 6. Logan in London. Rory mooching off and being entitled (and definitely not getting her shit together and proving that she is the force of nature and bright angelic girl that everyone viewed her as, and definitely not going on to report Obama's campaign lol. Nope that you think about it, that must have pissed ASP te most if you look at what she had actually intended for Rory). Luke and Lorelai not communicating. Emily trying to understand Lorelai. etc. 

It was a long myth that ASP had set up season 6 in such a chaotic way as a sort of ""f. u"" and to have the incoming writers to deal with the mess but now that you look at the revival, there's no denying that it wasn't the case. ASP was going along with her full-circle plan, but the plan was cut short and season 7 happened.

Full circle. Lorelai is a lot like Emily, in the end she wants the happy married life with the man she loves. Rory is a lot like Lorelai in that despite having all the opportunities and support, she makes mistakes. All three Gilmore Girls are independant and smart, yet terribly flawed characters, and the cycles repeat themselves etc.

We got it.  The revival makes perfect sense if you put it right after season 6. Just imagine Lorelai doesnt tell Luke about the night with Chris and it adds to the ""keeping things from each other"" and the no reaction to Rory cheating with Logan. If you take into consideration that ASP wanted to have 2 more seasons, it would have worked. 

Anyway, I had a lot of issues with AYITL and they deserve their own thread, but in general I appreciated it. I couldnt accept that ending at first because of the lack of character developpment and change, but now that I see that it's clearly ASP picking up the same characters she left off in season 6, it makes sense. It's kinda sad she had to work with that 10 years later though.

1350,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2016-11-27,2016,11,27,13,5f3kgy,self.GilmoreGirls,[Revival Spoilers] - Meant to be . . .,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5f3kgy/revival_spoilers_meant_to_be/,starshollow1,1480220442,"Ok, so, as a huge member of teamjess, the ending of 'Fall' really annoyed me to begin with! I felt so sorry for him and I really hated his sad glance at Rory through the window. Poor Jess :( He is so hot and has made something of his life! Why is stupid Logan all that Rory can see?

HOWEVER, I've reflected a little and I honestly feel that ASP is also teamJess all the way too and that the episode actually does reflect that (as does OS). Reasons:

1) Although different in some ways, Rory and Jess' lives have so   many similarities: both had absent fathers, both had eccentric mothers, both had a connection to and love for Luke, both had the same levels of intelligence and shared interests, both truly understood each other

2) Rory and Logan may be similar in some ways, but they are all materialistic ways: both have wealthy family members and a well known family name, both went to elite, Ivy league schools. Logan never truly understood Rory though. He has no understanding really of her family (beyond Emily and Richard) or of Stars Hollow. He suggested to begin with, at Yale, that they have a casual relationship, Rory didn't want that then. Yet 10 years later that is still what they are doing and Rory is clearly still not happy. He also proposed to her at her graduation (totally something that Rory would want - not!) 

3) Of all of Rory's boyfriends, Jess is the only one who really got Paris Gellar's approval! That's pretty impressive to be honest! Paris' take on Logan: ""You, Logan Huntzburger, are nothing but a two-bit, spoiled waste of a trust fund! You offer nothing to women or the world in general! If you were to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow, the only person that would miss you is your Porsche dealer!"" Paris' take on Dean: I can't find a quote but I'm sure that Paris always felt that Dean was beneath Rory. Paris actually liked Jess when she met him though. She never said a bad word about him!

4) Jess is the only person who makes grown up Rory make good decisions. Lane may speak to her, Lorelai may speak to her, Paris may speak to her, none of that ever stops her doing what she is doing. Interestingly though, at the end of the summer episode, she speaks to Jess. Next thing we know she is writing a book and has a focus, she then very swiftly ends things with Logan. There has to be some connection there. 

I don't think that in the revival episode Rory still had romantic feelings for Jess. I think that she was blindsided by Logan and the glitz/glamour of his lifestyle. I definitely think though, that ASP was steering us to believe that one day she would love him again though.

Reasons:  It was deliberately mentioned that he was single, it was suggested that he lived nearby again (maybe back in New York, who knows? He seems to be able to come to Stars Hollow pretty easily/regularly anyway), the conversation with Luke on the porch was almost like Luke saying, I know you Jess, because you are like me. I've got my Gilmore Girl now, so I'm passing the baton over to you. You will get her someday, it is clear that Jess inspires Rory and I think that she will write the book, reminisce about all of the Jess moments in her life, work with him on getting it published (they also made a clear reference to the fact that he still works in that field), and build up a true friendship again, which will eventually lead to more. Finally, she may or may not keep the baby. If she does though, I think the scene at the end, of watching Jess care for Kirk and smile shows how much Jess has matured. He was pleasant to all towns folk (including Lorelai) in this revival. He couldn't stand the kirks of the world before or his mum, and now he is back to rescue her from a vegetable cult! He would be caring enough and loves Rory enough to see her through the baby situation, whatever she chooses to do. I really HOPE that the end of Fall and Rory's chat with Christopher was a sign that she has realised Logan is wrong for her. She will let him be involved in the baby's life (she knows what having an absent father is like after all), but I really think romance is over!

That's my take anyway!!!!!",17,12,False,self,,,,,

Rory chose Logan. She consciously chose to be with Logan over Jess. She wanted and still wants Logan, not Jess. Jess even tried multiple times to get Rory to choose him and she didn't. Rory knew Jess before she ever even met Logan, which is the opposite of Lorelai, Christopher and Luke. Lorelai loves Luke and always has ever since she met him / realized she loved him. I truly don't think she would have ever been with Christopher had she known Luke. At no time did Lorelai feel the same way about Christopher that Rory feels about Logan. Also, to shove Luke's fate on Jess is not something to be praised either. Luke sat around for YEARS watching Lorelai date seemingly every man but him. Jess deserves so much more. He deserves someone that loves HIM, not Logan. 

There are so many things that are different between how Rory's life will be with a baby than 16 year old Lorelai's life was with a baby. Just because Logan is rich like Christopher doesn't mean he IS Christopher. And just because Jess is poor and doting on Rory doesn't mean he is Luke. I'm not even team Jess but the revival made me love him and want only the absolute best for him (not that I wanted him to be unhappy before or anything), and I don't think Rory is what's best for him. I wish he weren't still in love with her and that he'd moved on. And maybe if Logan chooses not to be in Rory or the baby's lives then she'll go to Jess but that is absolutely NOT what Lorelai did.

The scene with Emily's realtor plays into centuries of hateful stereotypes of Jews as blood-sucking usurers, financiers, and businessmen--resulting, of course, in the Holocaust. The scene in question takes place in the second episode of Gilmore Girls A Year in the Life, ""Summer,"" when Emily Gilmore effectively kidnaps Luke to persuade him to franchise the diner and become a more suitable mate for Loralei. She whisks him away against his will to a potential property, a restaurant still in business that Luke is clearly embarrassed to be at given his many apologies to the owner. When they all come upon said owner, he's clearly not aware of the negative influences on his livelihood that the realtor and Emily just hashed to Luke (overtapped gas), and his unassuming, apron-clad, demeanor cast him as a victim. After they greet him and he reciprocates, our blood-sucking, opportunistic realtor reveals her name: Ida Friedman. 

Of course. The fast-talking, avaricious, dark-haired, New York-accented realtor's name must be stereotypically, recognizably Jewish. She serves as the engine for greedy, heartless financial expansion, which Loralei's judgmental snob of a mother tries to foist upon unwilling good guy Luke. I am simply livid. I never thought Gilmore Girls that deep or aware of a show, especially considering that I was raised by a single mother and was party to the realities of that situation that the show never conveyed--I never took it for backward or offensive. This is disgusting and I CANNOT believe that no one at any point thought to stop and rethink this. That had to be the realtor's name? Really?

I expect a response from Netflix or the show's creators accounting or apologizing for this hateful and offensive representation. I'm writing here just to voice my hurt and feeling of helplessness at this happening. I truly couldn't believe it when I saw it and I hope I managed to convey that to someone.

At first I HATED the ending, especially how they treated my favorite character: Jess. 

But then after pondering/festering over the last few hours/day ... I have eventually come to the conclusion of loving the ending for Jess and Rory. (even though Jess deserved much more air time even just with Luke/ Liz/ RJ). 

The parallels are crystal clear throughout the revivial series, but especially in Fall....Logan= Christopher and Jess= Luke. (As much as Rogan fans want to dispute it...it was literally spelt out in the finale. I get your pain...( I TRULY do) but I mean come on...facts are facts when they are written so clearly.)

Anyways, as someone who has ALWAYS been #TeamJess even over #TeamRory, after the first watch of AYITL finale, I was so flipping mad at the ending for Jess with him pinning after Rory in the window because why should he??...after she turned out to be so shitty and so horribly selfish.  I have vented and vented to anyone who would listen in the last day that Rory and Logan are both trash in the reunion (with Logan cheating on his CHOSEN and WILLING finance and Rory cheating on Paul with Logan and the Wookie)...so I was finally resolved as such..let the scum buckets aka Rory and Logan be together and leave my poor Jess alone.

However, then I realized how hypocritical it was for me to have ALWAYS forgiven Jess's many transgressions as a teenager with Rory but then not offer Rory the same forgiveness. Yes, Rory broke Jess's heart (and mine) a couple times after she shut him down, but my argument is she shut down any feelings she had  for him after he left her cause they hurt too much as she put too much faith in someone who she was warned by EVERYONE (except Luke) not to trust and was told countless times that he was not good for her even though she begged to differ. (I feel like Jess fandom feels these exact same sentiments after revival about Rory).

 Rory thought it was easier to let Jess go than to hold unto the anger especially when he would always be in her life due to L/L. Yet, despite all the pain she caused Jess..he was always so grateful for loving him in spite of himself as a teen and inspiring him to be his best self when no one else did (except maybe Luke...but Jess wasn't ready to hear it then) and especially when he did not deserve it. Jess was shitty when he dated Rory and there is no arguing that even as a Jess fan.

However, Rory believed in Jess when he was the punk, messed up, selfish kid who never deserved love in his eyes/ most of SH. She inspired him to be his best self even when he was at his worst, most selfish phase. As a Jess fan/ Milo fan, I always tended to forgive him even when he was honestly HORRIBLE. Because that what love does.

Rory has now reached her bottom..aka her selfish and destructive bottom self...just as Jess had in his teens. He has ALWAYS believed in her  and inspired her when no else has since the beginning (and even maybe just professionally in revival)  just as she did when he needed someone to inspire him in his teens.

Anyways..I have now gone from #TeamJess to #TeamJessRUN back to #TeamJessandRory again. Love is loving someone even during their darkest/worst/selfish days...Rory did it for Jess as a teen and I think he will be there for her in the future. Rory is the worst we have ever seen her the same way Jess was the worst when Rory and him dated all those years ago. Yes, it is bittersweet but so is life. 

Conclusion: Jess did not deserve Rory during his teen days anymore does Rory deserve Jess now. Yet somehow the love, inspiriation and support always remains no matter how bad it gets. Which is why I think they are ultimately it for each other and are soulmates. ",8,7,False,self,,,,,

Second, I put revival in quotations because it felt more like a reunion. A revival, in my mind at least, suggests that something is restarting. _Fuller House_ is a revival. A reunion is when writing is pieced together a bit awkwardly for a brief reappearance, and then it ends again. _A Year In the Life_ felt like a reunion.

#### Now to the title of this post. Respectfully, *was this lazy writing?*

By lazy, I don't necessarily mean uninspired or uninteresting, and I certainly don't mean untalented, but **was the effort equal to the task?**

To me, it felt like **Amy and Daniel took what they had already planned for Season 7 (and beyond) then shoehorned it to fit into 6 hours**, while making some adjustments for the limited availability of the cast and the budget. And with some consideration for the canonical Season 7.

 But **I don't feel like much effort was put into taking account the 10 years that transpired since Season 6 ended.**

I appreciate the cleverness of the throwbacks (more reason it felt like a reunion) and I understand that TV writing is constrained by realities of the industry, but since _Gilmore Girls_ is Amy's, I'm a little surprised that I find it more believable if I think of the characters as their 2008 selves, rather than 2016.",4,15,False,self,,,,,

She seems to have completely lost herself and honestly comes across as pretty snobbish and unlikable. When head masters Charles offers her a job she almost acted as if that would be beneath her. She has no job and has to move home but teaching at a top school? ""Blah no way that's for peasants."" She claims to be so broke she cant afford to buy new underwear but still seems to manage three cell phone bills and constantly flying back and forth between continents. Is Logan her sugar daddy as well as her engaged lover or is all this coming from the bank of daddy Christopher?

- lorelai and Rory both come across as pretty unlikable. Winter starts off with them completely forgetting about Rorys boyfriend of two years. lorelai and Luke don't even remember meet the poor guy yet we seems to know a ton of details. I know this was meant to be funny but if you really look at it they all come off as complete dick faces. They dress different then they once did to. No more jeans and a tee for lorelai. They both are dressed to the nines the whole time and seem above or at least separate from the rest of the town. THEY HAVE CHILD SLAVES FOR GOD SAKES! If I had just come into this never having watched the original show I would despise these woman. They just seem like total snobs.

-The stars hallow musical...WTF. seriously. what the absolute fuck. I kept thinking it was over but it wasn't... It just kept going and going and fucking going. I actually physically cringed in my seat. I pulled the blanket over my eyes. What was this fresh hell? I'll tell you what it wasn't. It wasn't Gilmore Girls! Our beloved Gilmore girls was quick and witty and face paced. this sack of crap doesn't fit with the style of the show at all. 

-Luke and lorelai never talked about marriage or children in the nine years since the show?

-The whole town agreed with Taylor and loved the musical?

-the thirty something gang and their stupid slap sticky bit?

-Paris's whole character? I don't even know where to begin here.

-The weird twin peaks thing they tried to do in ""fall"". Don't get all artsy fartsy on us Amy! Its doesn't fit with the style of the show. It was never ever done before outside of a dream sequence. 

There's so much more I could go on all night but my fingers are getting sore. I'm so so so sad :( Almost nothing felt right about these and I'm just... so... sad :(

In fact, the entire Revival will be debated; just as the original show is still today. We can argue day and night about who the father is, and whether or not Rory will let him know, and what ASP was thinking, and why it ended the way it ended.

That being said... after her talk with her father Christopher- a lot of us are assuming that Rory will probably not tell the father of her child (Logan?). I have many reasons why I believe this is plausible, but for sake of argument let's say that Rory indeed doesnt tell him.

It brings me to this point: 
Rory knows how Luke felt after discovering his paternity. She knows how much it affected his life, and affected her mom's life. She knows how heartbroken and angry Luke was that Anna didn't give him the opportunity to be present in April's life; to see her first steps, her first day of school, birthdays...

How could Rory do this to another man/person? ESPECIALLY with how much she loves and respects Luke? ESPECIALLY after she's seen how much it could destroy someone's life (and rob her child of having a father). Remove the Chris/Lorelei factor- this is a completely different situation and there's no comparison. This would cause a MAJOR rift. Luke would never stand by it.

She had jobs practically handed to her. When she went for that job interview she was so up herself she didn't even think to prepare! She treated the chilton thing like it was beneath her, and she didn't show any compassion for Paul, she barely interacted with lane who is a childhood friend, I can't even remember if she asked how lane was!

Her arc was just dumb, I felt like I was still watching lost season 7 Rory rather than a 32 year old woman who should have her shit together. I get being lost in such an uncertain career, but it was SO unlike her to have no back up plan!

Also I don't get how she wasn't concerned about having an affair and being a side piece, but a one night stand was a big deal? It almost felt like everyone in her past had their life together but Rory is still playing little lost favourite Rory.

I think she did a horrible job with the revival. Yes, there were things I really loved and I was crying, laughing, and smiling all of the way through, but after knowing where those moments take us, it's either not enough or a huge distraction from storylines that needed way more time and attention. I hate that she made all of the characters the same or worse than when we left them. I hate how cheap most of the moments of growth were. I hate that Jess and Rory had the shortest conversation ever in spring and then suddenly because of a look it's game on? Why didn't Jess talk to her a few more times if that's what we were going for? And ugh the final four words. I'm kind of okay with this ending now, but I'm appalled to think this is the story ASP set out to tell about a career driven girl graduating from an Ivy League school. Rory's struggles felt so contrived and forced. Rory was such an obnoxious character throughout. ""Oh I'm not back"" ""I'm not part of the thirty somethings club"" ""I'm going to complain about not having a job even though I volunteered to run a free newspaper instead of hustling to find a new gig/explore my options"". I think the book about her life was a cheap move by the writers and I would have preferred she write about almost anything else. And why would a show known for its amazing dialogue use so many montages? Why does zach's life update get precedence over lanes? And while I loved Paris and Emily's stories both felt bloated in some spots and still not as fleshed out as it should have been. And it felt like they cared way more about bringing in a ton of people and playing with cinematography than the actual characters and storylines that suffered from it.  I hate that ASP took the one thing from season 7 I hate the most and basically did it with Rory. Why make a character be pregnant when they've never shown an interest in kids or family? Why make a character pregnant who wants a career that would be near impossible to do with a kid? Why not give us actual lead up to show the characters are actually interested in kids? And I mean I guess abortion is still an option, but these surprise pregnancies completely rob a character of their agency in the matter and I hate the idea of Rory just going through with something she doesn't seem to want just because she think she's powerless to do anything differently. And speaking of lack of agency, why in the fucking hell are we watching Rory seem really into Logan but she is incapable of telling him what she really wants? I feel like Lorelai's wild journey was a pretty big waste of screen time, and I was put off by the idea that she had to cross the country to look at a valley to remember a nice moment with her dad. Why didn't she just go on a single day hike and get it over with.  Even two or three day hikes would have wasted less time. And I'd really prefer Lorelai to have worked though her problems by talking it out ( ideally with Luke) rather than all of this really long plot with minimal pay off. 

I think knowing Amy's intentions really ruins the original series for me, and I'm very apprehensive about what she might do if we get another season of this. I normally love talking Gilmore girls for hours on end, but now I just can't muster the energy to invest in Rory's journey, and I don't trust ASP to properly show us anyone of the other characters journeys either. I really feel like she wasted a lot of our time and even made a lot of her characters worse than when we left them. I don't mean to be so negative because I did love so many moments, but i think the long term character arcs are just to important for me to only focus on the nice moments.",62,46,False,self,,,,,

I mean Rory is no Lorelai, as in the OS as well in revival, we see one common trait in Rory, she is and feels privileged which is so not Lorelai. And again the same with Logan, Christopher. Luke and Jess as well.

Maybe in this new circle, Rory ends up with Logan, unlike Lorelai/Luke in previous circle. I mean people and relationship pairings can go either way or opposite way. But in the end what signifies the circle is the destiny of the child getting knocked up like her mother.

I'm just going to get it out of the way and say -- Dean didn't change at all. Jared played him *exactly* the same, and it was pretty incredible how seamlessly he transitioned back into Dean! Smalltown boy, soft spoken, sweet, lives the White Picket Fence life... but he's still a little bitter about Rory despite it all. His meeting with Rory was exactly how running into your first love should be: a little awkward and weird, but like Rory said, they really do shape you as a person, and you never truly resolve things. Out of all the love interests in the show, I thought his performance was the best in staying true to the character.

2. **Logan**. I think Logan had the most interesting transition from the show. He's grown into a very proficient businessman, and I'm not sure how I feel about that change. Except for the scene with the boys, Logan was quite subdued: his voice was lower and less animated, his movements were a little more precise, and he never displayed a 'fuck the system' attitude. He seems to have settled comfortably into the life he always pushed away; I'd even argue he's openly embraced it and wants nothing else. I wish the show had included more of a talk between Logan and Rory, though, because his feelings about her were very ambiguous and vague: a cold shoulder, followed by a random big gesture. *Would* he say yes, if she proposed? Is he pining and patient, waiting for her to make the calls? Or does he want her as his mistress only, because building an empire is more important to him now? I was never a Logan fan, but they could be a great match... if I knew where he stood. The show made it seem like Rory loves him, and I could see it, for the first time.

3. **Jess**. I expected more of Jess in the revival, ngl. The show treated him more like Rory's sibling than an ex; he pops in and out of Stars Hollow, comfortable with Rory enough to tease her (but not in a 'chemistry' kind of way), and there was little chance for them to reconnect. As someone who has always been Team Jess, I was a little disappointed in their lack of interaction! Milo played the subtly the best, though; I know exactly how Jess feels about Rory without the show having to spell it out for me. My only complaint is I feel like the show stole some of Jess' characteristics and gave them to Logan; Rory and Logan had always bantered, but that sarcastic book-referencing and laissez-faire relationship may have suited Jess and Rory more than Logan and Rory. I wish we had seen more of his life, too, in terms of where he's living and what he's up to.

1. There were a few new characters but mostly all the old familiar faces were there. I mean they kept the same town troubadour for god sakes! And even miss Celine, the old lady that deals with Emily's wardrobe... LOVED IT. 

2. It felt like we were visiting home after living away for so long. A few things have changed and aged but most have stayed the same! I love how years later they can still make me feel like that watching a tv show. 

3. I feel like the show has come to a complete circle. Lorelei grew up, raised her baby through college and into the real world. She FINALLY ends up with Luke, gets married. And now it's all Rory's turn. Yes Rory may be a little older then Lorelei was when she set out of her journey of raising a baby, however  she will be heading for the same storyline of single motherhood.  And the whole scene with her and Christopher making sense now. It seemed to me she was just trying to verify in her own mind that she could do the single mom thing and debating wether or not she was wanting to do it alone. 

4. Loved everything about how they dealt with the death of Richard. Very well done, had me tearing up multiple times. And that memory of him in his study... broke my heart!

She offers to make Rory's trust fund available early but that was bumbled (for the best probably). About 1/4 of a million dollars was to be made available to Rory on her 25th Birthday which is how the show left it IIRC. 

So in the revival with Rory being 32 but is now broke and the trust fund is not mentioned. So either she blew through it all (what i think would be a very un-Rory thing to do) or the writers forgot/ignored it for conflict/drama's  sake. This i think is rather lazy.

I have decided after watching ""A Year in the Life"", that Rory is pregnant with Logan's baby. I believe that this has been planned since the very beginning of this show. Logan was planned to be Rory's Chrostopher. To shed light on why Lorelai constantly goes back to him. It gives the back story and explains why the two are so connected. Jess is the manifestation of Luke, so we know that Rory will end up with him, but she will have a convoluted and passionate relationship with Logan for the rest of their lives.

So my question is if ASP considers the series ended, but Netflix want another season can they go ahead without her?

But -- 

Why can't Rory just get a normal-person job!? So she moves back home at the end of ""Spring,"" and for about half a year, she only does two things: 1) Editing the Gazette and 2) Writing her book? I mean, that's lovely and all, but she complains to Jess about being broke... One thing that really annoys me is how she says at some point that it's either writing the book or some job she doesn't actually want. Well, newsflash: You don't always get exactly what you want. I think the Gazette is a lovely idea, I think the book is a lovely idea, but it really annoys me to no end that, at 32, Rory doesn't even seem to try to provide for herself. I mean, look at Lane, for example! She was more of a grown-up at 18, when she started working at Luke's, than Rory is at 32! She doesn't have to, I don't know, wait tables or tutor kids forever, but I feel like she should at least be doing SOMETHING, at least part-time, while she's living at home and writing her book. 

I feel like the one thing that really bugged me about Rory in the original series (at least the later seasons) - how she basically took her lifestyle for granted - got a lot worse in the revival.

They have amazing chemistry and it was built up beautifully: you really feel that they were always meant to be together and it's so lovely when it works.

But it's pretty surprising, really, that I can still find them so cute because....they're never actually cute together. Well, they have about five cute moments once they're finally a couple. It seems like ASP decided ""They were friends first so they should still act mostly like friends"", ""It's far sweeter for their love to be implied rather than shown"" but...huh? It's not sweeter, and it's not realistic! They should have been so excited to finally be in a relationship. They're ""perfect"" and ""destined to be together"" yet never say I love you? I was absolutely gagging for them to say it during the engagement scene, ANY couple would say it, but no...We get Luke pour his heart out, but Lorelai can't say anything back - just stare at him like ""Aww, he's sweet"". They finally get married, but after a kiss it's just walking away from each other and we hear nothing about how much it means to them...

Why does ASP keep their relationship so damn restrained all the time? I feel like I have to imagine all the cute moments myself, heh, and it's not fair! She's the one who developed the relationship and made it convincing, got me invested in it, but then abandoned all the spark. 

I still believe in their connection, which is why I still find their relationship engaging, but I sooo badly wish they'd been given more passion and emotion. It's what they deserved. :(

Their ""end game"" just makes no narrative sense for EITHER of them and it doesn't match up with what any of the cast said at all. 

At heroes fanfest, Milo signed some girls picture of Jess with ""you're still a contender"" and he allegedly laughed and said ""that's not all he says to her"" but ... that literally IS all he says to her. That's the biggest lit moment there is in this revival and it's lacklustre and very platonic!! When Jess tells Luke he's over Rory and looks into the window, there's actually zero build up to that. And leaving Jess open to Rory while Rory doesn't even KNOW that he's open to her makes no fucking sense!

More proof for possible cut scenes between Jess and Rory? Michael Winter's comment about knowing which boy has ""the edge"" by Summer. Rory ""breaks up"" with Logan on the phone in Summer and Jess and Rory have ONE scene. Who has the edge?! It doesn't make sense. And Alexis saying that Rory ""makes a choice"" and it's clear ""who wins her heart"" and the answer to ""which team"" is answered .... none of these things were true, not decisively. 

Plus we know a scene with Logan and Robert had been cut, as well as a scene between Lorelai and Michel about the Dragonfly expanding. Michel's arc actually got a proper end and it was cut, so it winds up feeling like there's no resolution. And I know ASPs like ""Oh my audience is smart, they can infer the ending I'm going for"" which is why she cut Michel-Lorelai, and I think that's maybe why she cut Rory-Jess.

One of the reasons they give is that the dialogues aren't as good, as fast, as ironic. 

Personally, I didn't like the revival much. Of course I was happy to see ""my friends"" again but the whole thing was extremely boring. I didn't even have expectations storywise, hence wasn't disappointed in that, but the pace of the revival was so slow, the dialogues so poor, not funny, not ironic. There was so much unecessary drama and, most of all, so many scenes that were something between a soap opera and a B-level old musical movie. It was really painful.

Chilton set the precedent so that Rory felt comfortable asking her grandparents to pay for Yale (though Rory at this time fully intended to pay them back - she said it would be too easy otherwise), and then asking Chris to pay for it so that she wouldn't feel indebted to them. 

Revival Rory seems to owe nothing to anyone (either money or gratitude). Obviously the whole show is hinged on this initial arrangement, so the way Rory turns out is the way she was supposed to turn out, but if she had had to figure out a way to pay for things on her own, or if anyone who had given her money had actually expected it back, it probably would have done her some good.

And to have them playing golf on rooftops? Was it an homage to the movie? I didn't think either of the SPs had anything to do with ATU so it struck me as odd. Even as an homage from the LDB to ATU, I wouldn't think the LDB would copy something so closely. Their ideas have always been so original.

There are a lot of things that require us to suspend our disbelief and reconcile that 9 years have gone by and our characters are STILL having issues that they would have realistically encountered years before now. 

One thing that I think would have really helped with a lot of the issues I am having...I honestly wish that ASP would have just made the creative decision to roll the years back a little and maybe not have the show set the full 9 years in the future.

I mean, they could have easily rewound the clock a little and things would have made more sense.

Luke &amp; Lorelai's relationship (not talking about kids yet, not being ""married"" yet) and Rory &amp; Logan's relationship (her more recently being in love with him but rejecting his proposal, him more recently taking on the load of the Huntzberger empire) would have made so much more sense in the scheme of things. 

With Rory &amp; Logan in particular, there wouldn't be such a weird feeling about them having this super-extended cheating relationship while dating/being engaged to other people. 

Also, Rory being a bit younger and being unexpectedly pregnant would fit better with her character's career choice in journalism - meaning that it is far more understandable for a younger character to be in-between writing jobs and not solidified in a career yet...thus resulting in the shock and the new challenges that being pregnant would bring. 

As it stand in AYITL, Rory is 32 and hasn't established any kind of stability in the career she's had 9 years to continue pursuing? With an Ivy League degree? I don't think so. That's way too hard to believe...so why didn't ASP just roll back the clock a few years?

He got angry a lot. Rory seemed scared of him when he yelled at her. He called her a billion times a day and controlled who she spent time with. Plenty of us considered him abusive, or at least borderline abusive.

But given his scene in the revival, that may not be at all how ASP saw him. When Rory told him what she would say about him in the book, she gushed about what a perfect first boyfriend he was. He was generous and funny and smart and ""taught [her] what safe felt like"" (I might not have that word perfect, but it was pretty close to that). 

Now, it could be that Rory is just glossing over her relationship with Dean because she doesn't want to tell him ""Well you were an abusive jerk so I'mma skewer you in print"" but I didn't get that impression. I think ASP's Dean is genuinely a great, generous, kind boyfriend who took good care of Rory and whom she didn't appreciate at the time. ASP's Dean is not the Dean we've been talking about on this sub.

I think the same can be, and has been, said of Logan. The Logan many of us knew (even before S7 Logan) isn't the one ASP wrote in the revival. In fact, Jess is the only boyfriend who seems consistent, and that may be because he got so little screen time since he left the show the first time. His role has been so small (especially pre-revival), just glimpses of him that give us an idea of what he *might* be without enough screen time to really get to know him again.

I think Logan in the revival has been talked to death, but Dean less so. I'm really glad he's happy now. And I'm VERY glad he didn't give off the impression that he's still in love with Rory. But apparently he wasn't an abusive boyfriend in ASP's world, after all. (Doesn't mean viewers have to stop thinking he was, just that ASP's vision isn't what some of us saw).

My mom watches with me, but she didn't see all 7 seasons like I did and she also happened to fall asleep when we watched ""Fall"" so I needed somebody to discuss GG with me. So here are my thoughts (albeit, it's long so I apologize) . . . 

So, first of all, I cried when Lorelai spoke about her favorite memory with her dad. Richard and her relationship throughout the entirety of the show was something that was complex and awkward in some ways because they never seemed to relate to each other. However, the death of Richard still had to make a large impact on her and I couldn't imagine all the thoughts that were going through her head in ""Winter"" when she was arguing with Emily about how she, too, lost someone. Lauren Graham NAILED that scene when she called Emily. And it just sounded something like Richard would do and yet, it also shows something that was unique about their relationship because I, for one, did not expect anything like that to really have occurred. 

The only thing I did NOT like at all about the revival was the stupid musical. I was about to skip over it, but I felt like there was going to be something important so I didn't. However, I was dozing off and I was frustrated that it took over 10 minutes for them to show all of these songs that served no particular story development purpose (except during that one song when Lorelai had her 'epiphany'. 

I didn't really see the purpose of Paul either, but maybe it really emphasized the whole ""Full Circle"" idea. He wasn't really needed, in my opinion. Unless, Amy wanted to paint Rory as more flawed. I've always loved both Lorelai and Rory because they were tangible--they both made some pretty big mistakes, but they were still likable woman who are still strong. 

Anyway, I was kind of sad to see Rory was repeating what she did with Dean with Logan by having an affair with an engaged man. And it painted Logan as someone I just didn't love as much anymore because well, he was going to marry someone he obviously had no feelings for just to appease some sort of social aspect and his dad, but he was willing to just have this weird relationship with Rory and then drop it whenever she wasn't with him in London (side note: it took me forever to realize what was going on in ""Winter"" because I wasn't sure if they were flashbacks or whatever. Was I the only one???) Anyway, I was told that ASP refused to watch Season 7 because she was no longer a part of GG during that time so all she did was make sure that the continuity of the season and the revival was there. I think season 7 Logan and the revival Logan are painted very, very differently. I have always been team Jess but, Logan was a close second, but there were some things that I didn't like about him. I think season 7 Logan was very likable, but I feel like Amy really, really wanted to see a parallel between Logan and Christopher. To me, that was extremely obvious when Rory went to go see Christopher for that 1 scene in ""Fall"". Christopher didn't really fight to help raise Rory because he didn't really seem to want to. Christopher was always complacent in my opinion. However, as I rewatched the original series, I've never really hated Christopher until season 6 and season 7. And parts of the earlier seasons kind of rubbed me the wrong way. But in the end, Lorelai always seemed to be wanting Christopher to be a dad to Rory and for them to be a REAL family and on top of that, she always seemed to have some sort of LOVE for Christopher. The two of them had a chemistry that was unarguable and that was something I always just understood and empathized with. But with Luke . . . Luke was just always there for Lorelai. He was there for Rory and he was always helping Lorelai and they watched each other for YEARS being with the wrong people, but as both of them cycled through their new beaus at the time, they were always there in each other's lives. 

That's why I will always be #TeamJess. Jess is Rory's Luke. Jess was a stupid, immature, and crazy in his younger years (season 3 specifically), but he always seemed to really CARE about Rory. I know many Team Logan-ers always argue that Jess's actions at the party were NOT okay in anyway and while I agree, I agree to an extent. Jess was upset (in my opinion) because he failed Rory and he failed Luke and he failed SCHOOL. Jess never felt like he needed school, but he wanted to take Rory to the prom and he wasn't going to be able to do that anymore. He also knew that he would be kicked out by Luke because he broke the deal he made. Jess never was going to rape Rory and he obviously felt awful after Rory ran out. He had a lot of emotions going through him that night and I think it just escalated. Flash forward to every other season that Rory was in college and Jess was STILL there. Jess was there to steer her back to the education that Rory was made for. Jess was there to be honest and straight-forward with her when her grandparents, her mom, and her own boyfriend (Logan) couldn't do it. Jess was always on the backburner for Rory, just like Luke was for Lorelai throughout her relationships with Max, Digger, and Christopher. He's always there and let's face it, he's matured. He's successful in his own way and he's got a good head on his shoulders. Jess makes sense to me because he's someone I would need in my life--he understands Rory in a way that nobody else does and therefore, he can be honest with her without destroying her. He also just wants her to be happy. He doesn't benefit from telling Rory to get her ass back into school or to write GG, but he does get satisfaction from her being happy and that's true SELFLESS love. I was legitimately crying as he stared at Rory from the window. The look on his face really showed his deep care for Rory--something I just never saw with Logan (he is my second pick) and something I never, ever saw with Dean (and his scene in ""Fall"" really showed that). 

I enjoyed the ending because it really was FULL CIRCLE and it really shows the idea that ""history repeats itself"". In some ways, I was angered because I felt like Rory should have been smart enough to not repeat Lorelai's mistakes, but in the end, Lorelai's mistakes made Rory and that was her best achievement. Rory was supposed to make this mistake back when she was 22, but ASP had to adjust but it really is interesting how Rory is 32 and Lorelai was 32 back in the OS. Basically, Logan is Christopher (at least, I think that was the intent of ASP) and Jess is Luke and if you want to know what happens later, then just rewatch the show (and skip season 7, in my humble opinion because Amy never wanted any of that). But for those of you are team Logan can just be happy that there was no real ending to the show that really emphasized what was what so the ending is somewhat open to interpretation. I just think that in the end, it kind of makes sense that Amy made it end the way it did because it's something that's tangible in life. 

What are some of your guys' thoughts? Why are you Team Logan? For those of you who are Team Dean, how did you feel and why were you Team Dean this whole time? How did you feel about the scene? How did you feel about Rory's mistakes and her relationship with an engaged Logan? 

I'm just on an emotional roller coaster and I want some discussion!

Guys, some time ago, Amy Sherman Palladino guided Rory's behavior to a curve that a lot of people didn't expect and I see a lot of people in denial about it.

Rory is not Lorelai, but it would be wise to say she's a mix between Lorelai and Emily. When Rory started to be reckless in season 6, that wasn't a phase, it was a characteristic of her personality.

Lorelai moved away from that world and created Rory out of it, but from the moment she begins to relate in the world of her grandparents, her personality begins to reveal itself. Logan does not represent Rory's detour, her perdition, he represents exactly the kind of person she wants to be with. Rory likes high society events, she was a privileged child, she likes parties, trips, expensive restaurants, influential people, sex and all the dazzle that life offers. So the appearance of Logan threatened Lorelai so much, the fear of the daughter to want that. And Rory wants to.

That is the main reason why I don't associate the relationships between Lorelai/Luke and Rory/Jess. Today's Jess is a person who would please the young Rory of Stars Hollow, not the new Rory. I think their timing mismatch only shows how much life made them different people, incompatible in the way of seeing life, that only share the passion for literature. I don't think jess would be happy like that, it doesn't represent him and that's why team Jess's hope is always crushed, Amy herself has said that the two aren't each other's fate. Lorelai was looking for a Luke, Rory isn't looking for a Jess, and Amy was mean by letting him pining. It makes no sense to compare these two relationships with a future potential, since Rory's love for Jess it's a long time gone. On the other hand, Lorelai/ Christopher have never had a real relationship before having a child and aren't like Logan/Rory, which was the most serious relationship in her life, someone she was still in love with 10 years later, who was a completely match with her in almost everything. Their love is so blind and dangerous that along with immaturity it can be very destructive.

We are always comparing the three ex's and listing the qualities to justify a possible relationship or  define who is the best for Rory, but in fact it doesn't matter how much they became better people, Rory's love as far as we know is Logan. Amy said that her old flames from teenager years are over, they were tools of growth, the remain question is if Logan is another one. Are they over for good? 

Rory cheated on Dean, Logan, Paul, helped cheat on Lindsay and Odette. This is no coincidence, it's part of her prerogative. Logan accepted his ""faith"" and turned out to be a rich, ""family's man"", but so horrible sad, without the guts to do what he wanted to do and only probably was happy with Rory.

He didn't see any problem in being with Rory while he was engaged, Just like her. Nobody was used there, but both had Feelings they didn't face.

The way Amy treated the situation this new season exemplifies exactly how Rory and Logan are similar and how he was certainly the love of her life, regardless of anything, their bond will never go away now. There's no point in hating Logan and liking Rory. I hated What Amy did, but her point is very clear to me. It doesn't make sense to root for a ""team""now, she won't take the boys's qualitys in consideration. 

Rory is a perfect anti-hero, that character full of flaws, with many dubious moral issues, but you still root for her because you believe that something will one day change or because you sympathize with her passion and keep humanizing her. If we get new episodes, don't expect that to change, that's what it is.",170,223,False,self,,,,,

For her whole life Rory has been spoiled and coddled and given everything.  She has no responsibility, relies on people to save her instead of saving herself and hasn't made it work probably because she's never truly - truly - had to fight tooth and nail for anything. The revival pulls no punches in showing how selfish and entitled that has made her.

But now she is pregnant and suddenly it's not all about her anymore. There's a little person going to be born in less than 9 months and suddenly Rory's going to have to take responsibility for it. Just how Lorelai had to step up and become an adult when she was pregnant at 16, Rory now has to do the same at twice the age Lorelai was. Rory's emotionally immature but as we could see in the Chris scene, she's already made up her mind that she's going to do this and she's going to succeed. 

It's not really a tragedy either. Being a single mother isn't ideal, but she's 32 and if she wanted kids she'd need to start planning to have them in the next few years anyway. She's spent a decade being carefree and focusing on her career. There is no reason why she can't live off her writing or even have to 'settle' for becoming a teacher. She has Lorelai and Luke to help her. She'll tell Logan but I honestly don't think she'll marry him or move to London. The only thing she has to decide is which life she wants for her child. The rich life as the Huntzberger heir (and we know that once they get their claws in they'll have all the say in how she and Logan raise their child), or the Stars Hollow Gilmore life?

It's said that Amy wanted it to end the way it did.  Emily becoming her own person and really finding herself, Luke and Lorelai finally marrying each other. Rory is Rory.
I loved the little wedding scene and I thought that was done beautifully. I'm still curious for more but if it's the way it ends, I'm not mad. 
I don't understand why Sookie and Jess weren't at the wedding. Maybe cause Michel has been there for Lorelai this ENTIRE time and hasn't left her side. So although Sookie was still her best friend, she wanted Michel there.
Lane was there because Rory was at all the Korean weddings with Lane. I love how that came back up.

I think the progression of Lorelai and Emily was strong. Something broke free and they finally understand each other.

I definitely agree with the idea that Logan is Rory's Christopher and Jess is Luke. (I do however have another theory about Jess but as far as we know, Rory and Jess only saw each other once so this might not be right). 

I think Logan and Rory definitely had their moments. But they cheated in their first relationship and both cheating again in the second round. I'm not a fan of Rory in that department at all. 
I am Team Jess, yep. He's pushed Rory and she's pushed him. He wasn't the greatest guy at first but he's definitely matured. I don't think Rory and Jess' story is quite over yet (if they continue the show). I also never forget the line when Jess says something like ""When I saw you when I got off that bus I knew we were meant to be together"". User whackedout101 said something along the lines of how he can criticize her but it destroy her. And that is extremely true! Rory tends to run away or back out when things don't go her way or gets some criticism. Jess gives it to her and she takes it and works in a positive way. Being told to go back to college and start the book over in a new way. He helps her ideas and actions. 

It also makes me wonder. If the baby is Logan's, will Rory turn start taking over Emily's role? This is only if Logan were to cancel the engagement and what not. But would Rory have to turn into the perfect Huntzberger wife? Help boosting her husband's company and doing whatever she can to make sure he is successful, etc. Just a little thought. 

I'm glad Dean is over with. He deserves to be happy with a family. It seems Rory has FINALLY sailed that ship completely.

Lorelai and Emily end the series in a very similar place as when they began - the scene where Lorelai asks for money to exand the Dragonfly is almost word for word/shot for shot the scene that sets up the overarching conflict in the OS. However, this time around the conversation not as fraught, and were left with the distinct impression that while certain aspects of their relationship have remained the same, much of the damage has been repaired.

Maybe the same can be said for Rory and her situation. We get some satisfying resolution for Emily and Lorelai, but we seemingly dont get any for her. But what if this pregnancy IS a type of resolution and her own opportunity to alter a familiar cycle? Lorelai once said that Rory was supposed to have more than her, and maybe in a way she still can. Maybe more is a committed father who is an active part of his childs life. Maybe more is that Rory doesnt have to take on parenthood alone like Lorelai did.


I think there is thematic evidence that supports the possibility that Logan might come through. 


**The story of the founding of Stars Hollow:** Two star crossed lovers who seemed destined not to be together until unusual circumstances brought them to the same place. This could be read as an allegory for Logan and Rorys relationship. 

**Parallels between the season 6 finale and the revival goodbye:** In season 6, Logan asks Rory to give him a reason to walk away from his preordained life and she says she cant. He doesnt ask her outright in the revival, but at various points throughout the LDB night he tries to pry a reason out of her. Again, she doesnt give him one, but she comes close by asking Are you really going to marry Odette? Shes hesitant to ask for more because she doesnt want to be the reason he gives anything up. If hes going to do it, she wants it to be of his own volition.

**Across the Universe reference:** I don't think it's an accident that ASP chose to pay homage to a film about two people who fall in love, fall apart, and find each other again.


This pregnancy could also an opportunity for Logan to break his own cycle. Maybe the birth of a new Huntzberger heir forces him to consider what he would want for his own child, and thats the compelling reason for him to forge his own path. Maybe in the end he isnt Christopher, but Lorelai. And if thats the case, then maybe Rory can finally let herself love him completely because hes made the choice for their child and not for her.


I hate to think that the story ends any other way because not only would it mean that Rory gets cheated out of a happy ending, but that all of Lorelais sacrifices were in vain. And if thats the case, then what was the point of the original series?

When Lorelai walked through the door and realized the kitchen smelled like Sookie, I was so excited to see what would happen. But Sookie seemed *so* distant. She wasn't energetic, she didn't do any Sookie-isms like squeal and run to Lorelai to hug her, or sing, or be the comforting friend. Nada. The whole tone was really tentative and awkward from Sookie's end. They weren't on equal friendship ground.

The scene almost showed that Sookie and Lorelai aren't friends anymore. She's become closer to Michel, which was constantly reinforced throughout the episodes (how they've been friends since before Sookie appeared on the scene, how they both have dreams of expanding their empire... he was even one of her 'bridesmen' at her secret wedding ffs). It's Michel leaving that prompts Lorelai to start looking for a new location. Nothing changed in Lorelai when Sookie left.

I wanted to see Sookie so badly in this revival, but now that I've watched the scene... I wish it had not been included. Maybe Sookie and Jackson had moved somewhere else, because Sookie became famous, and they could have showed a clip of her on T.V. in a fancy restaurant, or something.

I'm a 31 year old dude. I'm a teacher. I've enjoyed Gilmore Girls for several years and really liked the new episodes. I read a bunch of negative comments about them on Facebook, though, and felt compelled to put this post out in the world. I know it's long-winded and I doubt many will read it, but it feels better than replying to random people on a dumb Facebook thread.

Background

I watched Gilmore Girls for the first while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in 2011. My girlfriend at the time (and my wife now) was a fellow volunteer in the same city; over the course of two years, we spent our evenings and some weekends streaming each episode of Gilmore Girls. She'd watched the show when it originally aired, and, being the same age as Rory, really identified with her character. For me, the show was a warm blanket I could wrap up in and forget about speaking in a foreign language for forty-two minutes. Similarly, everyone seems to have their own personal connection with the show that they associate with the time period in which they watched. This seems to be a both a blessing and a curse for the revival; although fans have rapidly consumed the show and taken to the internet to discuss it,  they seem to be judging the quality on whether or not their own personal expectations for Character A were met. That sucks, because the overall story is massive and nuanced in a way that ""Team Jess"" or ""Team Logan"" proclamations overlook.

If not for my wife's insistence, I might have given up on the show after two or three episodes; I never took WB shows very seriously for some reason, and the strength of those episodes alone wasn't enough to shake my bias. As I continued to watch, though, I grew an appreciation for the world Amy Sherman-Palladino had created-- it was nuanced, interesting, and, perhaps most importantly to me, funny. From Miss Patty declaring that she was relieved to have had so much sex earlier in her life to Kirk regaling us with tales of cat attacks to Taylor's birth metaphor in the final episode, the show is at its best when it's funny.

Expectations

ASP's ability to develop characters is also the reason people have very strong opinions about what they think should happen. Based on the response I've seen so far, people generally wanted more face time with Rory's ex-boyfriends in order to confirm their preconceived ideas of who the best boyfriend truly was (some have suggested that the musical should have been shorter in order to accomodate more time with Jess or Logan, for example). To them, the show must have always been about these relationships alone. Their expectations apparently not having been met, many are taking to Facebook and declaring that Zach looks different, that they don't like Rory anymore, or that they would have written things differently. Reading these initial responses, I can't help but wonder if these people realize that conflict is what drives a good show; that seeing Rory happily married to someone she dated in high school or college and working for the New York Times would not be compelling television; and that a world in which you get to view a character like Zach's twelve year arc and the changes he's gone through is actually really magical and rare for a television series. Although I have a definite Jess bias, I did not feel personally invested in the continued exploration of Rory's old boyfriends. I tried to avoid any specific expectations, other than a kind of general desire that Rory would no longer be with one of her ex-boyfriends, and a hope that the writing wouldn't suck. As a Kirk fan, I also hoped in a general way for some hijinks from him. 

I was not, on any account, disappointed; in fact, from my perspective, the show was better than it had ever been. I thought Kirk's antics with Ooober and dressing as Jack Nance's character from Eraserhead were hilarious (as a Twin Peaks fan, I've long thought that certain episodes had a Lynchian influence; multiple references to his work in these new episodes suggest that it really might be the case). I liked the fact that Rory, who'd basically had the world handed to her in the first several seasons, is now, despite early success as a reporter, floundering and confused. I found the development of Luke and Lorelai's relationship believable, and their marriage in the fourth episode much more fulfilling than the original twenty-second Season 7 resolution. I loved the fact that Kirk played such a sweet role in making it happen, legitimizing him as a character in way we've never before seen. I loved Emily's development as a character. I loved seeing the people of Stars Hollow again, and, in the case of people like Taylor, seeing them engaged in the story in a way that felt like more than just a cursory tribute-- there were real, engaging, funny moments that add to overall story in a way that feels genuine. I loved the ending, and I feel simultaneously excited and repulsed by the prospect that more will be added. I loved the fact that it didn't feel like a WB show anymore-- GG was always great within the parameters their previous network allowed, but it sometimes felt too sanitized and idyllic. The characters go to some dark places in these new stories and occupy that space longer than some fans seem to feel comfortable with. I understand why the Holden Caulfields of the world might want Rory to be a teenage wunderkind forever, but the anxiety of a one-night stand is actually more appropriate to her 32 year old character. The story also just feels complete for the first time, with a bow that ties it all back together. To add more might make it feel like a less symmetrical story now, if that makes any sense. 

For all these reasons, I've been blindsided by the initial negative response in the show's Facebook feed and also here on reddit-- so much so that I feel compelled to defend it. 

Response to common criticism

1. ""Zach looks old!"" - Comments like this not only fucking suck, they're short-sighted. I already hit on this point a little bit, but it's incredibly rare for a show to develop a character from their teenage years into their 30s. It sort of reminds me of a metaphor Vonnegut used in Slaughterhouse Five (bear with me)-- instead of appreciating the entirety of a mountain range, people tend to fixate on one specific part. Folks seem to want ASP to fixate and develop one specific piece of the mountain/character, instead of painting an entire picture. On a side note, I wonder how much the people making these comments have changed since the show originally aired. In any event, I was impressed with how the characters developed and changed, while the general tone and feel of Stars Hollow remained the same.

2. ""I don't like Rory anymore!"": Look, I get it. She's doing truly repulsive things. The thing is, that shouldn't exactly surprise anyone. This isn't the first time in the show's narrative that Rory has slept with someone who's already spoken for, and the only reason she felt bad about it with Dean was because she was caught. This is another one of those criticisms I suspect come from a place of being ""Team Logan""-- although I always thought he was kind of sleazy, there was enough ambiguity in the initial run that people could overlook or justify his sliminess in the name of him ""growing as a person"" or ""how nice he is to Rory."" There's no room left for that now-- Logan is, and perhaps always was, a pretty despicable dude who is charming enough to talk Rory into things she wouldn't likely otherwise do. It was always there in the previous show, but the stakes were never as high as Logan being engaged to another woman. The new show confirmed his sleaziness in a way that can no longer be defended-- and folks who have been ""Team Logan"" for years no longer have a leg to stand on. With the exception of the affair, I liked Rory's character in this new run more than I ever have before. It's interesting and relatable to see a character struggle with the expectations of adulthood. Also, I can't harp on this enough: ASP obviously intended for GG to be a continuing story, with several chapters. As the story develops, Rory changes. I read several comments where people complained that all this groundwork had already been laid for Rory to be successful-- Chilton, Yale, the Obama job, etc.-- as if one characteristic (""success"" or ""hard work"") is enough to define a person. If you watched the show expecting Rory to read books on the bus and talk to teenage boys, obviously you were going to be disappointed. 

3. Even among people who seem to have liked the show, a consensus seems to be growing that the musical was too long. I hope I can in some way begin to turn that tide-- I thought it was actually one of the most interesting and funny parts of the new episodes. I wonder how many people lobbing this criticism have seen Bunheads, ASP's project between the old and new episodes of GG. As a thirty year old dude, I was probably outside the target demographic for a show about teenage ballerinas. All the same, it's a great series in which ASP continued to develop as a writer. It wove dramatic dance and song sequences within the plot in a way GG never did, and I wonder if missing them made the Stars Hollow Musical feel out place or not in keeping with the tone of the original show. To me, it felt like a tool I'd seen ASP use to great effect before, and I was on board with her continued development as writer. I was also already familiar with Sutton Foster's character in Bunheads, and I couldn't help but wonder if she was supposed to be the same character here. I honestly laughed so hard I was crying throughout the whole thing-- Taylor mouthing along the lyrics was so silly and funny in the best possible way. I did not want it to end. It was weird and funny and unique.

The only part of the new episodes I thought was kind of stupid were the Life and Death Brigade scenes. Maybe I'm just being too literal, but are we really supposed to believe that Rory, Logan, and Logan's friends spent the evening posing on the tops of various buildings in Stars Hollow? I never thought they were funny or charming-- buying a business just because you have enough money to do it, or trashing a restaurant and throwing money behind you to atone for being a jerkoff, is not very compelling TV to me, and the only pleasure I took from it was that it was very obviously a ""last hurrah"" for Logan. Other than that, I'm very satisfied with these new episodes, and I felt compelled to put those vibes out in the world.",72,114,False,self,,,,,

And other thoughts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5f8jr3/revival_spoiler_can_we_finally_take_rory_off_her/,gg1024,1480292471,"Throughout the O.S. and now revival, Lorelai always seemed to try SO hard to be the opposite of Emily- especially where parenting is considered. From the show, it seems that Emily never allowed Lorelai to feel good enough/control her own life, so Lorelai overcompensated with Rory by always praising her and allowing her to make her own decisions. In fact, everyone did. It started getting on my nerves how often Rory was praised by her school, neighbors, and family- especially because her achievements weren't that great/deserved in comparison to Paris. 

I think Rory was a little too perfect in High School, so ASP began to humanize her in college by having her mistakes and failures. That was good. But no one's perception of her ever evolved, and neither did Rory's sense of entitlement. 
Examples?
In college, Rory slept with Dean, a married man. Lorelai told her it was wrong and she got so mad/offended that they didn't talk for a long time. Rory kept trying to justify her actions when it was clear that what she (and Dean, of course) did was unfair to Lindsay. Yet, the townsfolk and Lorelai ultimately forgave her and she kept the same angelic perception everyone had always had of her. Later on she kissed Jess when she was still dating Logan. ALSO: Rory actually cheated on Dean by kissing Jess during Sookie's wedding in High School. I forgot about that one. 
Now, to the revival. At least with the Dean thing, it was kind of a one-time thing. From the scenes with Logan, it was clear that they had been sleeping together for at least a year, even after he was engaged. Rory (and Logan for that matter) seemed totally fine with this infidelity even though it she had seen how it messed with Dean's life for quite a while. Oh, and I forgot that she was cheating on Paul too. Regardless of how real their relationship was, she was still cheating. 

In college, she was rejected by the NYT. No one saw that coming, not even Rory. Her grandparents bought her an apartment before she even got a reply back. Lorelai was genuinely surprised, because she had kept saying that there was NO way that Rory wouldn't get. Props to the writers for finally giving Rory a failure btw, as I don't think she ever didn't get the school/boy/anything else she didn't want. 
But then I guess she didn't learn from that, as she had this same entitled attitude in the revival. Exhibit A? The SandeeSays thing. Genuinely felt like she acted a little bratty when she didn't get the job, and was way too confident about the whole thing. 

And lastly, on the whole niceness/popularity thing. In high school, Rory seemed like such a nice and friendly girl. I didn't understand how she got elected as the VP because people ""thought she was nice"" if she never spoke with other people and stuff, but she was still good. I'll ignore the complete inconsideration of others feelings, especially Dean. But anyways, she was an overall nice person. In college/revival? I don't think she was any nicer than any of us. With the body-shaming comments at the Yale ballet performance, and later at the pool, I was disappointed. I was disappointed by how stubborn she was with Lorelai when she said she didn't want a book written about her life. Rory got so mad because she felt entitled to tell someone else's story, so that she could get out of her own financial/creative troubles. I don't know about you, but I definitely understood why Lorelai wouldn't want to be so exposed/vulnerable in the book. Bottom line, she didn't end up being that nice either. 

In some ways, I am a little mad at ASP for making her like this. In other ways, I find it so interesting how she humanized her in a way that was realistic and was still able to get the show's fans to want the best for her. The way she had Jess change over the series only made me love him more, but I realized something. Don't hate me for saying this y'all, but I don't think Rory deserves Jess. I genuinely think Jess is too good for her at this point. So whatever guys, Team Logan can happily win. They may not bring out the best in each other, but something tells me that Rory would bring out the worst in Jess- and that would be worse.  

So yeah, I guess this was just a rant about how strange it was to me how even during the revival, Rory was put on this moral and personal pedestal. Even Lorelai seemed fine with Rory's sketchy relationship with Logan. When Rory acknowledged that she had been wrong to Paul, Lorelai proceeded to blame their ""connection"" or something when that was completely irrelevant. 

In the end, I wish Lorelai and others hadn't given Rory such an elevated view of herself/what she deserves that her sense of entitlement and oblivion to her privilege was almost laughable.

It felt like the whole thing was a sitcom without a laugh track, and I was furious with the ending. However, after I've had a little time to digest it - I actually came to a sort of clarity - so here's my defense of the revival

**1) The Logan + Rory affair is not actually out of character from what we know about Rory**

Rory views romantic relationships as an emotional experience rather than a commitment. She cheated on Dean when she felt the emotional experience with Jess is stronger and more exciting. She cheated with Dean when she needed the comfort of home in college. She tried to cheat on Logan with Jess, but couldn't because she loved Logan. She had no problems having the affair with Logan because Logan was her emotional support through her crazy job situation. 

**2) Our expectations of Rory to have matured is not necessarily realistic**

One of the biggest complaint is that Rory is still so privileged and spoiled and that she doesn't seem to have mature or changed. I think honestly that's more of a commentary on current day young adult life instead of just the world in Gilmore Girls. I know plenty of  friends who are responsible, mature, and ""adulting correctly"" - however I also know plenty of people that age still trying to figure things out. I think her lack of maturity is more of ASP's take on early 30s life nowadays - which is also shown through the ThirtySomething Gang. 

**3) Gilmore Girls was never about Rory**

Sometime in the first season - viewers fell in love with the smart overachieving girl - and were rooting her to succeed. However, this show is much more meaningful looking at the mother/daughter relationship focus and the focus on community.

I think that piece is really vague and totally up to interpretation.

And Logan diehards, yes you are totally entitled to create the head cannon that post-revival Rory tells Logan about the baby, he marries Rory, changes his ways, and they buy a poodle. Heck I hate Logan and I would love that. But as I have said in other threads, *no part of the revival hints at that.* 

The only hints we get is that Rory realizes Logan, like her dad, will never change, and she decides *not* to tell him, and to raise the baby on his own. (Clearly Logan's baby, btw.) Meanwhile Logan clearly plans to marry Odette and no one is putting a gun to his head. Will ASP change Rory's mind down the line if they get more seasons? Will Logan find out and change? Maybe, maybe not. But their happily ever after is no more hinted at now than a romance between Rory and Paris. Sorry, friends. Them's the breaks.

Spoilers for it below. 

1. The Mary Sue main female character: Joey and Rory. Both bookish, both have guys fighting over her, both ambitious, and both turn into fairly awful people at the end.

2. The roguish male best friend character: Pacey and Jess. Both come from dysfunctional families, both don't go to college, both have incredibly crappy relationships with their respective girl, both crazy about her even YEARS after their breakup.

Interestingly (as the GG revival shows), the ""bad boy"" seems far too well adjusted compared to the Mary Sue. Jess is a successful writer and seems normal and happy (while Rory was a broke, unemployed sidepiece). Pacey turned into a successful restaurant owner (while Joey was in an unhappy relationship with a guy who almost became her fianc). Both shows have led fans to wonder if Jess/Pacey could do better.


3. The show's teen protagonist has creative aspirations - Rory wants to be a writer, Dawson wants to be a movie director. At the end of the series, he turns the story of his life into a movie-then-TV show (*The Creek*). Much like Rory writes (groan) *Gilmore Girls*, a novel about her relationship with her mother.

* Bonus observation: The same thing happens on *One Tree Hill*, where Lucas's memoir about his high school love becomes a major bestseller. 

Honestly, WB, you were creatively bankrupt to reuse this plotline across THREE shows.

I know ASP fancies herself some kind of unique, quirky auteur. But it doesn't look like her original ideas for GG were *that* revolutionary, considering shows on the same network did similar plots/characters/character dynamics.

Hell, she could have had at least a couple of one night stands. 

Christopher, on the other hand, shirked all of his responsibilities: Rory, Lorelei, college, his Strome's business, etc, until the very end of this. He flitted from adventure to adventure, with someone always catching him when his new business venture had failed. Even when he *had* to take care of Gigi, he called in Lorelei as soon as he could (and she came running, because that's just who she is) because he didn't have a clue how to do it on his own, nor was he even willing to try. 

Rory ""grows"" up, some what, but doesn't really seem to do anything with her life. She's not fiscally responsible, she's smart (just like Christopher was), and she knows what she wants to do, but she isn't driven, she doesn't have the drive to make it work.

She only wants thinks that are easy: instead of pushing for the Conde Nast meeting, or even taking Mitchum up on his offer (akin to Lorelei asking her parents for money), she just lets it expire and takes over the Gazette. And while she's not content to live in Stars Hollow, she's not exactly doing to much to fight it, either. Same for Christopher. He seems content to just have things handed to him, even though they aren't really what he wants: he never fights for anything.

Rory is awks. 

Lane is Korean and has funny moments. 

Jess is stupid. 

Dean is nice. 

Sookie is funny and I like her marriage with the vegetable man. 

Michael is fabulous. I like his snark. 

I don't like Taylor. 

Gypsy is funny. 

I like Miss Patty. She's really lived. 

Kirk is annoying but funny and needs to be less Norman Bates like. 

Emily and Richard do their best. Emily can be a stone cold b@&amp;$ and needs to learn to let things go. Richard is kind hearted, but as a 1%er he is out of touch with reality. 

Paris is crazy town. Dole and her are a good match.

Lorelai and the funeral pissed me off so much (almost as much as Rory's storyline). After all these years, Lorelai holds so much contempt for her parents that she couldn't find *one* nice thing to say about her deceased father. I get that she was caught off guard, but not having anything nice to say about your dad isn't a mistake (like she argued). And then she told Emily she was horrible, and I just couldn't. (Disclaimer: I think Emily didn't handle the situation well either and did say hurtful things.)

Personally, I get it, and that's why I'm biased. I didn't get knocked up at 16 like Lorelai, but I have a similar relationship with my dad as Lorelai did with Richard (and my family also places importance on our public image and perfection). My dad wasn't around much growing up because he worked long hours providing for our family. We didn't have much of a relationship, and as an adolescent I questioned how much it would actually affect me if he passed (which sounds terrible, I know). We're not close, or emotional, or affectionate, because that's not who he is. But by college, and definitely independent adulthood, I realized he loved me in the way he could and appreciate everything he's done for me and my family. I would be devastated without him now, and think we're as close as we can be given each of our personal limitations.

But after 48 years, Lorelai still holds so much contempt for her parents while refusing to end her relationship with them and still asking Emily for things. And only after her ""going Wild"" moment did she realize there were some positive aspects to her relationship with her father. And frankly, while we all have our baggage and issues, Lorelai still being so negative after so long seemed incredibly immature and was another reminder of how little these characters grew in 9 years.

[Revival Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5f9x9v/team_jess_was_shortchanged_revival_spoilers/,handtoglandwombat,1480310218,"Okay before you roll your eyes at me just hear me out. 

I liked the revival. A lot, actually. I just want to try and describe why it left me feeling so sad. In a good way. In an effective way. 

Logan got a lot of screentime, and a really interesting story with Rory that illustrated just how flawed both their characters are. Dean received one of the most lovely send-offs of any character, a moment that actually made me pause the show and reflect on myself as a person for a moment. But Jess got an ending that left me with an ache in the pit of my stomach. 

I think many of us here at team Jess appreciate him because like the audience, he believes in Rory. Let's be honest, Rory is a tad molly-coddled, and he's the only person who has the ability to straight up call her out. When she gets distracted by money and luxuries and party lifestyles she starts to take on vacuous, self-involved qualities and she kinda has the ability to treat people like shit, even if she doesn't mean to. Jess is the one who loves her potential, and the only one who has the guts to tell her ""this isn't you.""

But after watching the revival, I can't help thinking, ""maybe he's wrong."" That's what made his ending so sad for me. He still loves that part of her, but he kinda knows it's no longer the dominant part of her personality. She knows it too. He keeps trying to steer her back to being her best self, to living out her dreams, but maybe it's time to admit that she ain't gonna get there. She's not who he believes she is capable of being, and never will be. This ending hit me real deep. It felt so disappointing. Team Jess was short-changed and it was brilliant. ",34,44,False,self,,,,,

I HATED it at first. Truly, truly HATED it. I was in shock!
 
Now though, I truly, truly believe that ASP is without doubt trying to make the Luke = Jess, Logan = Christopher, Lorelai = Rory parallels. If not, then seriously, what is the point in the ending at all??

Yes, they are all different people. Of course they are. She is not claiming these characters are clones of one another! She is however, claiming that there are parallels that can't be ignored.

In all of their life stories, what everything pretty much boils down to is timing. If Lorelai had met Luke when she was a teen, in love with Christopher, their story may have been very different. She did, truly love Christopher once upon a time. We can't deny that. She was blindsided by him for years and couldn't easily move on. However in the end, it was Luke that she realised she truly wanted to be with. Why? Because it was Luke that she realised helped her to make good decisions. It was Luke who was there for her (and for Rory). It was Luke who actually understood who she truly wanted to be.

This, I believe is what Jess is for Rory. Rory is not in love with Jess during the revival, no. That is blatantly clear. She is totally in love with Logan. She is totally in love with Logan's lifestyle. However, there are parts of her that know he is not right for her (like there were always parts of Lorelai that doubted Chris was right). As much as she loves him, throughout the entire 4 episode arc, she never seems truly happy and carefree when she is with him. She seems relaxed and able to open up with Jess though. The scene on the porch at the end is the most happy and reminiscent of OS Rory we see I think. Excited about work, excited about a book, squealing like a kid. I am not saying that the revival is suggesting that Jess and Rory will be a couple again within a week after the closing credits! However, definite hope is suggested.

There is nothing to say Rory will not try again with Logan (after all, how many times did Lorelai try again with Chris). I do feel that ASP is clearly saying though, that in the long run, Rory's eyes will be opened to what has been in front of her all along, sparks will be reignited, timing will be right for her and Jess. I don't particularly like that story choice for Jess. I think it is sad that he will be waiting around. We watched Luke wait around for years though and I didn't much like that either . . . it still happened though. People are saying Jess is pathetic for still being in love with a girl he spent less than a year with in high school. Why is nobody calling Luke pathetic then? He spent pretty much all of Rory's childhood longing for a woman he had never even kissed or taken on a date!

Why is Jess so right for Rory then?:
-He is the only person she actually listens to when she is put down. If Paris puts Rory down, Rory just blames it on Paris being Paris! If Lorelai puts Rory down, Rory does something insane like goes to Europe all summer or moves into her grandparents and doesn't speak to Lorelai for months! If Emily or Richard put Rory down, Rory sulks. If one of the Huntzberger's puts Rory down, Rory does something insane again, like steals a yacht! When Jess puts her down though, she listens, she takes his advice, she goes back to Yale.
- Jess is one of the few people who actually inspires her. Logan and Rory never actually talk about anything other than money, family or school and moving up the career ladder etc. Dean and Rory had zero in common really. Jess and Rory though, they share a deep connection in terms of interests. He challenges her and gets what she needs. As soon as he said write a book about your mum and you, it's like a lightbulb moment for Rory. Nobody else in 2.5 whole episodes gave her any suggestions she actually liked prior to this.
- He has waited for her this long. He will continue to wait. He is a Danes (well, Mariano-Danes) after all! I don't believe he is sad enough to sit around and mope. I am sure he has had relationships (Luke did), besides Rory. I feel that ASP wanted us to believe though that these two are meant to be. Jess knew the Rory we all loved. Logan only knows the Rory we all hate! Jess will get that old Rory back . . . when the timing is right.",3,7,False,self,,,,,

They push Rory being a mini Lorelai.. but also consistently show how they're opposites. Rory is the responsible one who makes lists, does her laundry, etc. Lorelai is the bold, jump before thinking one- she always has to push Rory to take chances. Lorelai is, like Christopher said, a force of nature. She rarely if ever feels self-conscious or not good enough. Rory does many times. Rory is shy and mousy and hesitant. Lorelai is bold and brave and audacious. Emily is much more like Lorelai than Rory in personality. Rory and Lorelai COMPLEMENT each other perfectly, enjoy most of the same things, have gear dialog, but are entirely different personalities!

Lorelai gave up all her dreams of college and travel and love and put them on hold to raise Rory. It breaks my heart when we they talk in the OS about planning vacations around the world and waiting until graduation for Europe.. and then when she gets the job offer to travel and gives it up for Luke? Ugh, I die. She gave all of this up for Rory to have the life she never had. College, travel, all the dreams.. to have Rory end up like she did and now pregnant too.. fucking terrible. Soul crushing.

Remember that heartbroken look on Richard's face when looking at Rory on the USO stage? What the hell would Richard think of her now? 

Anyway, main point, I could go into the character assassination of Logan becoming Christopher, but really, Jess is not Luke!!! Luke was Butch Danes, trophy winner and Keifer Sutherland team mate. Jess is the guy who stole all the baseballs. Jess does not play team sports. Luke is the guy who is always there, even if that means sometimes being a doormat. Jess is the guy who won't put up with anyone's shit. Jess is so smart and can't stop reading. Luke needs a dictionary to communicate with April and can't name an author he reads. Luke's appeal is that he's mister dependable. Jess' appeal is that he's Mr. Unpredictable! 

I just hate that they're so uninventive as to have all the characters repeat the patterns of the previous generation. It's lazy and it destroys everything Lorelai sacrificed for her daughter. ",39,22,False,self,,,,,

Jess - teen rebel, high school drop out, abandoned kid is now a writer, has a steady job with a publishing agency, a good enough relationship with his crazy family and is pretty level headed

Lane - never held down a boyfriend, when she did get one he knocked her up straight away! Now though, she is happy, still drumming and living her dream, has cute kids, a dependable relationship and a solid (if strict) relationship with her parents

Luke and Lorelai - both considered failures for years by Emily and Richard. No elite educations etc etc. However, they are now happily married and both successful business owners.

HOWEVER, those who had everything handed to them on a platter and were considered pretty high up the ladder in OS are now not doing too well:

Rory - turned into an actual nightmare! A self absorbed, cheater with no compassion for other people.

Logan - pretty much same as above - egocentric, cheater.

Tonight I had the OS playing in the background while I study and couldn't help but laugh.

There was a certain coziness about the old episodes, the old Stars Hollow; a clear predominance of warm, vibrant colours, a clever use of both lighting and camera that are completely missing in the new episodes.
A few examples of how the key sets in Gilmore Girls were organised:


* **Lukes Diner** had a lot of windows so it was a well lit space, and even though natural light is bound to be cold most of the times, they compensated with a warm key light, making the diner look more pleasant. Little to none colour grading, it was all created on the spot. Also every single scene shot in there was very dynamic, the camera would follow Lorelai, Luke, Lane, Rory, giving a feeling of a familiar environment where there was always something to serve, someone to talk to, another table to sit at, even though the place itself wasn't that big.
* **Richard and Emily's house** had plenty of windows and chandeliers, yet it never felt welcoming; the camera was steady most of the times, especially in the first seasons, to emphasise the rigidness of both Lorelais parents, hence creating a contrast with the numerous tracking shots that followed Rory and Lorelais walks, wether they took place in the house or on the street. At Richard and Emilys no one would walk around if not when entering the house or leaving it, and that was not accidental. The lighting was warm but it was also opulent, like the furniture, the objects, the conversation.
* **The Independence Inn** is a neutral environment at the beginning (in the first episodes it looks almost too impersonal), but it quickly evolves into a way more dynamic set; predictably but also cleverly, they chose to move most of the key Inn scenes in the kitchen or in the living room instead of the reception; in the first two scenarios there was incessant movement, whether it was Sookie walking around tasting dishes or Michel following Lorelai complaining about god knows what while she does this and that. Instead, shooting most of the scenes at the reception like they did in the first couple of episodes would have been boring and not in line with Lorelais character. Again, none of these choices are accidental.
* **Lorelai and Rorys house** was the only set out of the main four that had it all: warm lighting, cozy environment, plenty of personal objects, pictures, memories. Again, the camera would follow both of them around, but even when it didnt, the quick conversation would step in to give a shot of adrenaline to the scene.

Almost every single one of these aspects has been ignored in the new episodes. The camera movements arent as fluid as they used to be, they do follow Lorelai and Rorys long walks, but now we notice it, its almost as if the camera wants us to acknowledge how smoothly its moving. I really, really dont like that.
As for the rest, of course, things have changed in fifteen years, it wouldnt bee realistic for an initially hostile environment like Richard and Emilys house to still be hostile after all this time, and obviously a lot can change in a diner or in an Inn, but the truth is, the cinematography didnt change because of these reasons, it changed purely to satisfy a more technological audience, an audience with an HD taste and a soft spot for heavy colour grading.

Just look at [these stills](http://imgur.com/a/IqRcx), and notice how foreign some of those environments feel now.

What bothers me is how the new cinematography has no charisma, its just a collage of whats trending now: we see either desaturated shots with consequent shallower depth of field and flattened image (all the scenes at Lukes, the market, Richard and Emilys house), or commercial-crisp images with unbearably cheesy lighting and pretty candy colours (the porch scene, the website interview, [the appalling and utterly pointless Broadway bonanza](http://i.imgur.com/8kOlWrp.png), and [the Stephanie Meyers Dior Ad that ended up being Lorelais wedding](http://i.imgur.com/7hYpm9Q.png)).
Jesus, it sucks.
Now, not *everything* has changed for worse. Some things are more realistic, even though I kinda hate them. For instance [in this scene it looks like some fucking aliens are about to land on Lorelais forehead](http://i.imgur.com/97L3s39.png). That light right there is not coming from the lamp, pals. There is [a similar scene in AYITL](http://i.imgur.com/aQ7ijCr.png) and it was handled better, or, well, at least it gives off a more realistic vibe. Now, of course, the field has almost no depth in the second case, whereas in the first one? Bam. Shadows in the background. Why? Because Michael A. Price, thats why. You truly are missed, man.

To be clear and to conclude this obscenely long post: I am not judging the Cronenweth style per se, I am judging the use of such a specific cinematography for a series that already had its specific colours, vibes, peculiarities. Gilmore Girls was made of vibrant colours, cozy environments and natural lighting, which heavily contributed in setting a very intimate and familiar mood. Without all of those things its hard to feel at home. Of course the recent atrocious plot developments did not help, but Im telling you, this cinematography doesn't, either.


**EDIT:** I changed the Dragonfly pictures, thank you for pointing out the mistake. I also added some pictures of the diner in the Fall, because some of you were saying that it wasn't a fair comparison since in one shot it was Winter and in the other one it wasn't. Well [will you look at this for crying out loud](http://i.imgur.com/MFsnUxe.png), and [feel the wrongness of it all](http://i.imgur.com/tkjNJ1J.png).

For me as a 31 year old, I feel they portrayed the lifestyle of a 30something in the current economic climate pretty accurate. Trouble making choices, constant doubt, not knowing what to do, barely scraping by, being selfish (we're children of baby boomers, not saying all Rory's decisions are right, but it's understandable if you've been raised thinking you can do all you want and you have to do what you like/love, and you should never settle, remember that) . I can also relate partly to Rory's dilemmas being a journalist myself.  Anyway, onto my point. 

The difference I feel between Lorelai and Rory is that Lorelai left the money behind at 16, thus learning what hard work entails. For Rory, money entered her life at 16. From that moment her grandparents always bailed her out financially. I'm not saying she's used them, or taking them for granted. But she's always known that whatever she'd do, if she found herself in financial hardship, her grandparents will help her out. 

So with all your help that in mind, it's not that strange how Rory's career choices pan out. 

What everyone's also forgetting is that a lot of 30 somethings are like that. I see it around me all the time. There are three groups: the lucky few who landed jobs they really want, the ones who are realistic and will just grab any job to make sure they are independent and pay their own way and the last group who will wait out for that dream job. The last one is particularly naive, because they don't realise that to get to their dream job they have to gravel, put in hard work. They need at least half of the attitude of group 2. 

Rory is part of group 3. And it's only partly her fault. Growing up everyone did everything for her. She didn't have a job in high school (don't know how common that is in the US, it is where I'm from, you start at 14/15, it's believed to help you understand the value of money), her mum did everything for her, her grandparents did everything for her, Luke, Christopher, all the boyfriends she ever had did everything for her. No one, except maybe Jess and Paris, once told her: Rory, open your eyes, step into the real world, this is not how it works. Not even her mother said: enough, you have to work. 

I loved to see Rory struggle, to see Paris, hated that they left out Lanes storyline. Because her struggle would be interesting too: staying in her hometown, still living for music, being a mum. I think they really really portrayed excellently what it's like being 30something in this day and age. 

I'm really curious as to how you feel about it.

My dad passed away this past June and he watched GG. His favorite character (that I'm aware of) was Paris. I'll never forget when Rory called Paris a ""pop-up book from hell"", my dad laughed super hard.

I knew that they would have Richard's passing in the revival. I didn't expect it to be in it so much that it was it's own character. 

It's something that I'm really happy about, but it made watching all four episodes hard. Even now, I'm having trouble remembering some scenes that are talked about in the other threads. I'll have to re-watch it sometime again.

Things I do remember and still have feelings on:

At Richard's funeral, Emily putting Lorelai on the spot like that. She knows how Lorelai can be when things are thrown at her with no warning. I don't mind Emily needing to hear good stories about her late husband; but I really wish she would have asked her in private. When Lorelai finally told her the story I sobbed so much. I'm having trouble keeping it together now.

Richard's tombstone. I loved how Emily kept sending it back and when Rory actually thought it was crazy; Lorelai stood up for her mom. ""Let her have this."" One simple line seemed like paragraphs of Lorelai's character and how I could relate to her. It's not often that she stands up for Emily's quirks.

Emily no longer having a spark in her old life. Richard was her spark in that life. I had several qualms with her in the OS, but they were old chapters to her. She still got on my nerves a few times about Lorelai and Luke; but seeing how she acted with a family that she couldn't even understand was brilliant. It was nice seeing her have some closure even as she grieved. Also, her with a harpoon is one of the best things ever.

Paris in general is still awesome. I'm a little disappointed on how big a factor a nanny was in her life with her own kids; but she still seemed a part of their life where her parents weren't. Dad would have loved Paris's restroom door kick. I think she could be her own super hero. (And any part that involved Paris being all up in Luke's biz would have had him laughing so hard he would turn red in the face). I'm sorry we didn't get a lot of closure with her story line since she was such a big part of the show herself, but I loved the direction they took her in; and now I can pretend that her and Jess get together eventually.

The only good scene that I can think of for Rory was her walking through the Gilmore home to her grandpa's office. It took me by surprise to see him behind the desk like that. I forgot for a moment that the actor really had passed. It was a beautiful scene.

I'm sure there are other scenes I meant to talk about; but I kept getting interrupted writing this by my two year old for bites of my jello dessert and I've lost my train of thought.

&gt;SPOILERS. If you've watched all four episodes and are disappointed, then keep reading; this is for you. I was pretty disappointed in the first three episodes but then the Fall episode revealed amazing story-telling had been taking place all along. When Rory said those last words, I wondered ""Who's the dad? Oh yeah, Logan. Why did she go see her dad? Oh, because she's thinking of raising her child without Logan as her mother raised her without Christopher."" Then I realized Logan is like Christopher and Jess is like Luke. Logan distracted Rory from her pain as Chris did for Lorelai. But Luke was always there willing to call Lorelai out when necessary as Jess did for Rory. No guy ever really understood Rory like Jess did. Its also very fitting that all we get about Jess and Rory's relationship is a longing look from Jess through a window without any reciprocation from Rory. The conversation between Rory and Christopher was kind of like an interview with the writers. 'Is it good Lorelai kept Rory from Christopher? Maybe not, but it was written in the cards. Nothing was going to separate Lorelai from her child. Only now that Rory is grown does Lorelai want to commit to someone else--Luke.' Rory's focus is not on a guy right now, its on her child as Lorelai's focus was on her. But Jess will always be there, secretly loving her while he supports her and her child as he or she grows up. Many, many years down the road, Rory will realize that Jess is her ""Luke""--her soulmate. But the writers wanted to end this story back where it began, no further. Ultimately, I found the conclusion deeply satisfying. I didn't realize I was being taken on this incredible of a journey for the decade I have watched this show. It isn't just about a mother and daughter who have a unique relationship. Its about how children are shaped by their parents' decisions. Sometimes children follow in their parents' footsteps and sometimes they go in the opposite direction. Either way, patterns repeat.

What's your take on this?

I think she likely hit the nail on the head for what ASP was going for. It's telling that the revival has Lane working at the antique shop like her mother, Paris going through a divorce like her mother with kids who prefer the nanny, Jess pining like his uncle/father-figure Luke, Logan working for the family business and keeping mistresses like Mitchum, and Rory following in Lorelai's footsteps as well.

It seems we are meant to conclude that the message of Gilmore Girls is that children are subconsciously driven to become their parents even when they try to fight it. I'm not sure how I feel about that; on the one hand there is some truth to it, on the other it's not exactly a hopeful message...

Paris has the career, but is detached from her kids and divorced.

Lane has the kids and the husband, but gave up her musical ambitions and works at her mother's antique shop (the same one she'd dreamed of escaping her whole life).

Lorelei makes every sacrifice she can to give a better life for her daughter, but Rory ends up making the same mistakes. Lorelei even says that she didn't feel she could fully commit to Luke until after Rory was out of the house - so while she had the kid and career, she couldn't have the husband. 

Emily had the husband, but a horrible relationship with her daughter for most of her life. No career or identity of her own until after her husband dies.

I don't exactly like the plot points that led to the precious final four words, but I don't think ASP owed us any specific plot progression, or resolution, and she certainly owed up nothing on the ship front.

What she did owe us was a well written revival that wasn't full of stupid plot holes, contrived devices and bullshit lazy writing.

There was so much filler that could have been used to show more about the supporting characters. Two boring pointless montage's about lines and paper delivers when Lane got practically nothing, we heard more about Zack's life than hers. A God awful, totally unfunny musical so ASP could force us to re-watch elements of Bunheads instead of the show we actually tuned in for (the ego bullshit on this one is the worst part I think), instead of seeing Paris and Doyle's obvious and potentially hilarious reconciliation. 

And then there is the stuff that made no sense. Rory has a trust fund, but is somehow broke? Just stupid and lazy, at least address it instead of hoping we forgot. Lorelei and Luke never talked about kids? Totally unbelievable, especially after in S6 both Luke and Lorelei specifically mention wanting to have kid(s). The literally faceless fiancee for Logan, shown in bed asleep? Either deliberately keep her off camera or give her an actual body. The life and death brigade montage that felt totally fake and contrived. The pointless waste of dialog that was Paul. Seriously, what was the point other than providing filler and fodder for stupid, unfunny ""jokes"".

I'm not angry because we didn't get our happy ending, I've always been 60/40 Jess/Logan, so either imagined ending (Logan steps up and they live happily ever after, or Jess is her Luke) is fine by me. I'm pissed because it looks like ASP and DP just wrote one draft and everyone said ""yes, you're geniuses"" and gave no critical feedback, despite the fact that the script SUCKED. Really, really SUCKED. This could have been good with essentially the same plot points if it had been well written, Instead we got shlocky, lazy garbage.

I get the general frustration with fan-service, but this revival happened because of the fans. We deserved a well written revival that actually made sense, not that shit.

My predictions were that Logan was endgame, and that he'd surprise Rory by turning up in Stars Hollow after she left him in London. I wanted them to be engaged at the end but in retrospect, I'm glad that her resolution wasn't about marriage.

But there are lots of things I would have liked to see instead...

Firstly, I didn't totally hate the musical but I think it needed tying in better. It would have been cool if it had gotten to the stage, and Taylor had somehow swung a visit from a top theatre critic who absolutely roasted it! The whole town united against said evil theatre critic. 

I like the arc about Lorelai feeling disconnected from the townsfolk, but again I think ASP could have done more with that. Like a series of funnyish scenes where she tries out knitting club, a book club, a cookery class (as well as the musical)... but hates everything. And only then does she decide she needs to spend some time away. 

Also, I'm about Rory's age I enjoyed her storyline and the way she was realising that life doesn't always give you everything you want. But maybe she was too much of a failure! If I wrote it I would have played more on the grounds that print media is losing to digital, and have Rory's main weakness being that she struggles to move on with the times and cut-throat markets. Maybe she wants to write for a top paper in London but they can't (or won't) pay her enough to live there. Or she's freelancing and finding that work is drying up, despite her publishing history. But most of all, her motivation is that she misses Stars Hollow and her family. Whereas Lorelai is questioning whether she *really* wants to stay in SH until she dies, Rory is craving exactly that. Logan doesn't want to move and regress so they break up, Rory returns, but after she arrives she realises she based her decision on nostalgia and that it's not all great. There's not a lot of work, there's nothing happening, and her friends all have nice lives and want to spend Saturday nights with their families rather than listening to Rory complaining :P 

The same with Luke and Lorelai having a baby! I liked that part of the plot but the way it was introduced and then just dropped seemed like it was being played for laughs. If I wrote the revival I think I'd have written them a surprise pregnancy scare (I know she's older, but it can happen) which they embrace and get excited about before it turns out they're not expecting after all. Maybe they get a false positive from some 20+ year old pregnancy tests in the Doose's stockroom (if that's a thing that can happen. If it is, it could be a good meta joke about how chaste the OS was). Then give them a bit of a longer plot arc about dealing with that. You could still have Paris as an OB/GYN. 

I wouldn't have broken up Paris and Doyle!! I'd have Doyle as a stay-at-home Dad who is always seen babywearing. 

The only thing I wouldn't change is Emily's arc, which I thought was perfect. 

I enjoyed watching the revival but I'd be interested to hear what you would have changed!

edit: Sorry if there is already a thread like this, I scrolled through several pages but there's just so much! And then I got over-excited and posted anyway. 

edited to add: I was also expecting a tie-in between Michel and Lorelai's arcs, like he asks her to be a donor or surrogate for them so they can have kids. It probably wouldn't have worked in the time available, but as soon as he mentioned the possibility of having children that's where my mind went!",13,2,False,self,,,,,

By some random stroke of luck, she is very very fortunate to happen upon a kindly lady who takes pity on the foolish headstrong teenager and takes her in. 

Lorelai now, kind of realizes that the real world, without access and privilege is actually kind of hard and tough. She works her butt off as a maid while raising her baby as she lives in a shed. Somewhere along the way she realizes that actually she was probably stupid to walk away from many opportunities that her parents afforded her that weren't so bad. She is too stubborn and foolish to go back but she decides to help Rpry get back everything that she gave up. Rory will not be a wild kid, Rory will be good at academics, Rory will hang out with wholesome, well mannered kids, Rory will go to an elite private school. Rory will get to see Europe and travel the world. 

So basically, when we meet Lorelei and Rory, we see them in a phase of their life where Lorelei is trying to give Rory everything she missed out on by running away. She still dislikes the snobbery that is prevalent in her parents world but she is old enough to realize their emphasis on education, manners and cultivation of character isn't stupid and tries to expose Rory to that.She actively works to surround Rory with rich snobby people by putting her at Chilton and she appears, at various points in the series, wistful of the opportunities she missed out on. I'm not also entirely convinced she ""hates"" her parents and their world. She was just never someone who fit in so as a self defense mechanism she rails against it all to make herself feel better. They say she isn't good enough and she tells herself she is actually awesome but they're the stuck up evil rich people! 

I think we, as viewers expected Rory to be a carbon copy of Lorelei because they are both pretty young women with some superficial similar habits. Meanwhile, the evidence is always there that even though Rory has heard her mom go on rants about how evil or awful her parents and rich people are, Rory never actually thinks its that bad. Lorelei is afraid of and intimidated by her father, Rory takes a liking to him instantly. Rory finds her Mom prudish and outdated, Rory finds Emily charming and maternal. Lorelei thinks cotillion is stupid Rory wants to be a deb. They BOTH find rich, snobby, well connected men attractive, see Christopher and Lorelei. 

Despite the fact that both these men treated them poorly, the Gilmore Girls couldn't help but keep.going.back to them. 

Meanwhile, by the time Rory enters Yale...her experiences at Chilton, being a debutante, her grandparents influence makes it so...she has more in common with super privileged Yalies than with anyone in Stars Hallow! 

Rory knows this too, hence why she tries very hard to fit in and be accepted into Logan's world. The only person in denial about Rory's privilege is her mom who perhaps resents her daughter in some ways for so seamlessly fitting into the world that spat her out. 

Rory acts like an annoying spoiled brat because she IS one! Don't be fooled by the cheap Luke's coffee she buys because as she tells the Huntzbergers, she's a Gilmore!

Also, people seem annoyed at Rory because they, despite her access to privilege her whole life, expect her to someone act like Lorelai. Lorelai left her parents and had to work a blue collar job during her young adulthood and lives a middle class life now at 50+. Rory in contrast now at 32 acts like the lady of leisure that she is. She dabbles in writing every now and then, jet sets to go see her wealthy boyfriend, sits in her grandparents lavish mansion to work on her novel. 

She couldn't have ended up more different than Lorelei and her townie friends.",12,25,False,self,,,,,

**Rory**: Career didn't go anywhere. No real relationship. Logan's sidepiece. No home of her own. Unexpected pregnancy.

**Lorelai**: Career goal met but somewhat stagnated. Lost Sookie as a business partner. Never had a child with Luke (or even a discussion about it, apparently).

**Luke**: Never got to have a child with Lorelai, even though it still seems like something he wanted. Too late now.

**Logan**: All his S7 progress as a man and a boyfriend undone. Back to being under his father's thumb. About to marry a woman for ""dynastic"" reasons. In love with Rory but not enough to break up with Odette. 

**Christopher**: Totally disconnected from Rory and Lorelai, banned from Richard's funeral and Lorelai's wedding, still divorced from Sherry, and Gigi living in Paris.

**Jess**: Successful author, but still seems hung up on a girl he dated for a few months in high school 15 years ago.

**Doyle**: Turned into a Hollywood asshole. Divorced.

**Paris**: Divorced. Turned into her own distant mother and her children's nanny is more of a parent to them.

**Zach**: Hates his job. Never got to do music full-time.

**Lane**: Never got to do music full-time. Still living in the small town she dreamed of escaping. Has taken over her family business rather than pursue her own passions.

**Sookie**: No longer at the Dragonfly. Disconnected from her life in Stars Hallow.

**Michel**: Bored working at the Dragonfly. Married to someone who wants to have children while he emphatically doesn't.

**Richard**: Dead.

**Dean**: Happily married with children. The one bright spot in a sea of grim reality.

Rory has turned into everything the young Rory and Jess mocked. She is having a baby with the man she is still in love with and can't quit, even though it's been destructive. She showed no signs of gratitude, much less love, for Jess and what he's done for her. It seems like time and time again, Jess comes into her life to point Rory in the right direction. She'll take that direction for a bit but then loses her way again and goes back to Logan. 

Hasn't he done enough for her? Do you want Jess to raise another man's baby? A man Rory can't let go of. Doesn't he deserve someone who will love him above all others?

The only real ray of sunshine in the whole thing was Emilys storyline and Kelly Bishops phenomenal performance. Her efforts to come to terms with Richards passing and find her place in the world were magnificent. 


Lorelais storyline was okay, I honestly would have expected Lorelai to have matured more by this stage so some of her actions seem overly immature. Lorelai and Lukes lack of communication is such an overdone, dead plot contrivance at this point that its just annoying rather than tension inducing. The celebrity chef thing was completely pointless, I would have far rather have had silly excuses for why we didnt see Sookie than the parade of famous chefs in the kitchen (Ill leave aside the huge plot hole of what have they been doing for two years without a chef?). The Michel plotline and the potential expansion of the inn were nice and probably should have been the main focal points of Lorelais storyline. Wouldnt it have been fun to see her acquiring the annex earlier and having Lorelai and Michel square off as to what exactly they were going to do with it? It was also nice to see Lorelai coming to terms with her fathers death. The pretzel story she told Emily was incredibly moving and honestly the highlight of Lorelais arc. Considering the incredible build up of 7 years in the original series and a year in this one the wedding felt both somehow unrealistically silly and incredibly flat. Not to mention the guests leave me scratching my head in confusion both in terms of who was there and who wasnt. All in all, Lorelais storyline was adequate but lacked something, a charm or effervesce that the original series had. 


As for Rorys storyline, well all I can say is, Amy needed to put aside her pride and watch season 7 and then perhaps we wouldnt have gotten such an unmitigated trainwreck. With Rorys plot, it is abundantly clear to me that ASP decided in Season 1 what she wanted the ending of this series to be and she absolutely refused to let go of the idea despite the fact that her characters had long since evolved past her original vision. Instead she spent this series trying to twist and fit these characters into something that no longer works and probably hasnt since the shows 5th season. Rory and Logan have both become meager shadows of who they were at the end of season 7, all growth and character development was completely lost. The Paul subplot was awkward and made Rory look cruel. Logan has clearly returned to the family fold, completely negating the season and a half of development it took him to break free. Both Matt and Alexis play the relationship as if Rory and Logan are still very much in love so the audience is left to assume that they while they love each other its just not enough, I guess. 


Then there is poor Jess, I admit I was never a fan of this character in the original series, but gods do I feel sorry for him now. In this new series, Rory says explicitly that she hasnt seen him in FOUR YEARS! Making it pretty obvious that Rory has no feelings beyond friendship for Jess and yet Jess final shot is him looking longingly through a window at Rory, implying that hes still in love with her. I feel like that last scene was ASP throwing team Jess a bone, albeit a very tiny one. Just like I feel like having Rory and Logan be in this overly complicated relationship and not being together at the end was a way to keep the shipping wars going. 


Ive been reading a lot people who say that the final 4 words we got werent the original final 4 words or that they would have been said by Lorelai in the original series and Amy did it this way to get a second season. I actually think these were the original 4 words and they are being said by the exact characters she intended. However, I think the situation around them was engineered to ensure a second season. I actually feel wretched for both ships, the Rogan ship got jerked around, Rory and Logan were both made to look like somewhat unfeeling and callous cheaters who both loved each other but not enough to commit. On the other hand, we have poor Jess (man Ive come a long way on that character). Rory obviously doesnt care for him that much, I mean she hasnt even seen him in 4 years despite the fact that her mother is practically married to his surrogate father! And Jess is still pining for her? A girl hes spent a grand cumulative total of probably 48 hours with since they broke up. Theres a point where waiting for the girl is no longer romantic, its just pathetic. Luke never fell into the pathetic trap because we saw him date other women and Lorelai flirted with him just enough for us to know she was interested on some level. With Jess and Rory that hasnt been the case. So Amy has destroyed Jess too, making him into a caricature of the pining romantic heroes of old . As I said, I think it was all done either to deliberately keep the shipping wars going, to get a second season or in her effort to please everyone. If it was the first one, she probably succeeded but it was a shoddy thing to do. If it was the second, it will undoubtedly work though so many people on so many social media platforms seem so unhappy with this revival Im not sure what the viewership will be. If it was the third, well, it just goes to show that if you try to please everyone you end in pleasing almost no one.  


Leaving aside the main characters for a moment, we are still left with a mess of cameos that apparently serve no purpose other than to show how many famous people ASP knows (can there be any other explanation for Rachael Ray and the chefs?) a musical that dragged on seemingly forever, (Im guessing because ASP is still upset that Bunheads was cancelled) and minor character arcs that appeared and disappeared with no rhyme or reason, such as Paris.


What these episodes really needed was a team of writers, someone to say no to ASP and reign her in and perhaps tell her when the scripts and special were no longer working. Someone who could have helped tighten the scripts, cut out unnecessary scenes (I cant help think the pool scene added nothing and the fat shaming felt wantonly petty and cruel)  and pointed out viewers might be annoyed if Paris disappeared with no resolution and maybe we might be interested to know if Lane is happy. If Amy was truly married to the idea of those last four words, thats fine but there were a thousand and one ways to get to that destination, many that would have been in keeping with Rorys character at the end of the original 7 seasons and shown evolution and growth. Ways that would have kept alive the magic of the original series, sadly I saw little of that magic or charm on my screen. I dont doubt everything was arranged in such a way as to ensure further specials but I honestly dont think I could stand to watch because I fear if I did I would never be able to watch the original series with any sort of joy again. Its such a shame this all went so horribly badly when with a tighter script and little humility it could have all been so wonderful.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

Then we would've gotten to see a family dynamic between the two of them and whether or not a kid would've been enough to make it work. I think if ASP wanted us to believe that Logan was Chris, then having the child already exist when we start up would've been much, much better.

It also would've allowed the storyline to be about family as a whole, and the whole point could've actually been about how these characters are NOT their parents after a few trials and tribulations. Rory would want to be Lorelai. She'd try to be super mom and do everything on her own while also being a career woman and it wouldn't work because Rory is not as resilient as her mother nor is she even half as strong. She'd become frustrated with her life, have a break down at work and probably get let go, which would lead her into a downward spiral.

Lorelai and Rory would fight over the book and Rory's parenting style, and Rory could move in with Emily (effectively erasing the maid storyline). Luke would be coddling and enabling Rory because he did the tough love thing with Jess and really regretted it. He'd encourage Lorelai to maybe stop being so judgmental, which would only frustrate Lorelai further. He'd remind her of how miserable she was when Rory quit Yale, but Lorelai would say this is different because Rory is 32 and her life is a mess and it's not *just* Rory anymore, there's a child involved.

Overall, the whole lesson that Rory would have to learn is that she is NOT her mother and cannot try to be her mother. She has to learn how to be herself and raise her child in her own way. Therefore she'd still parallel Lorelai but she wouldn't be Lorelai 2.0 and Logan wouldn't be Chris and Jess wouldn't be Luke.

I'm just like...what? From what I saw they were shown to be a toxic relationship. It was addiction, not true love, born from their desire to escape from their unhappy lives. If they had really wanted to be together they would have. They were also both cheaters - is any relationship born from cheating going to end well? 

We also have things like when Rory finds out they are at his family's restaurant, Logan says something like , ""why else do you think I sprung for the $300 bottle of wine?"" Like, the only reason he's got the expensive wine is because he can charge it to his family, rather than because Rory's worth splurging for an expensive bottle. Rory also tries to visit earlier and Logan puts her off - because of Odette and probably because it doesn't fit into his plans. And don't get me started about the house. I know it ended up being a house to write in but I honestly thought he meant it to be their hideaway sex mansion. 

I honestly thought the revival was showing how BAD they were for each other, how being in each other's lives made them worse people (cheating with no regards to anyone else, but also selfish in that they wouldn't truly commit to it) rather than this epic, star-crossed love story.

I feel more incomplete than complete when I finished watching. At least S7 gave us an ending. And I doubt we'll ever get more episodes. It was crazy that they were able to get everybody on board. Which is part of the problem, because they fit too many people into only 4 episodes. We could of done without the 15 minute musical and honestly I think the Sookie part could of been cut. It was a small part and felt awkward with Lorelai and Sookie trying to act like their still best friends when Sookie left 2 years ago and it sounds like they had limited contact. They could of shorten the newspaper delivery part, completely taken out the pool scene. It's not needed. There was too many stuff that were left open.

What's going to happen to Paris and Doyle? They mostly argued about those stupid stairs, it makes it seem like if they moved they could maybe work out their problems. I didn't catch it the first time around, but as people are mentioning, why mention her missed period? Could Paris be pregnant? It might explain her freak out about Tristian if she was hormonal.

They never said what Lane is doing? Where did Zach end up? It almost seems like he got a normal job.

Is Rory going to tell Logan about the baby? I doubt it's Paul's because he was in the first episodes but we only saw text message between them after that. And each time Rory is surprised to hear from him and remembers she hasn't broke whatever they have up.

I know that ASP envisioned how she wanted the four words to be, but I didn't like the way it was went about. I think she wanted those last words to be put in but she tried to do parallels that Lorelai=Rory, Logan=Christopher, and Jess=Luke. And that's what I have a problem with. It just doesn't fit, it didn't make sense to me. She could of had her ending without trying to those parallels.

Lorelai was 16 when she had Rory, so it makes sense why she had nothing and had to start from scratch. For Chris, even though I get after him a bit, it is understandable that he would run away from responsible at that age. It's not that uncommon. It makes it seem sad that Jess is still pining away for Rory after 11 years they broke up and they haven't seen each other in years. It's not like Luke had a crush on Lorelai the whole time, it was only a few years. Plus it made sense because Luke saw her every day. Jess had plenty of time to get over Rory.

The ending ASP had in mind, would of worked for the S7 that she planned. I would of been okay with it because Rory would of just been starting out on her adult career. I just had a problem that she had to crash and burn everything Rory did to fit into her plan of trying to paint a parallel to Lorelai. Which doesn't work for me because Rory was working for 9 years and she did have some success. She looked like a baffling idiot during the interview for the blog spot. It made no sense why she wouldn't have a pitch. When she worked at the Yale Daily News, she would have to throw pitches to Doyle all the time. She would have to do that for any journalism job she had over the years.

It just makes it seem like ASP was ignoring most of S7, especially the Rory growth.

What we seen in S7 of Rory is somebody who grew stronger from her falls in S6 and learned how to stand on her own two feet and to roll with the punches better. There was the evening event that Logan and Rory went to, where we learned that Rory was writing articles for a website/blog. We see her make several contacts with several people, who even said they've read her writing. So, it looked like she knew how to network. It also showed Rory wasn't a snob about blogs/websites and was using it to gain some experience. We got the opposite in the revival from Rory.

Another thing is that the last episode we see Rory not get the job that she wanted, but she didn't let that crush her, like it would have in the past. She found another prospect, the Obama campaign, soon after. It shows that she learned how to roll with what life threw at her and you'll find another route to your goals. It seems like ASP ignored that Rory went on the campaign trail, because it doesn't make sense that nothing good would of come from that. If I was Rory, I would definitely have that on my resume, it's a big deal. It just seems that we got the same Rory, who doesn't know how to take what life throws at you from S6 and I just hated that ASP ignored the growth Rory went through in S7.

We see her take charge at being Yale's Editor and she was good, she spoke in take charge tone, she lead and directed them. I remember the Christopher dinner where they went for creme brulee, she took charge to get them to where they needed to go. In the revival she had the blog interview for the job, even though the person did make it seem like Rory had the job, it's baffling to me that Rory had no pitches or stories to write off the top of her head. That's what journalism is all about.

Even when she was working at the Yale Daily News, she would have to pitch stories to Doyle. So that made no sense to me and just seem like ASP only made Rory fail to have it seem like Rory is the new Lorelai, with being pregnant and having nothing. Which makes no sense, since Rory is 30+ years old, not 16.

We got no hint on what went on with Logan over the years? Is ASP using S6 Logan and ignoring S7 growth of Logan. Or did Logan fail in starting out on his own and went back to work for his dad? Or did Logan make it, become successful and he's now on decent/good terms with his Dad? We only saw a glance of Odette, so there's no way to see if they act like a couple or it's just an arrangement. That dynasty comment from Logan about their relationship makes it seem that way. Or he was only telling Rory that to make it seem like what their doing is okay? I have no idea. There's nothing on Logan's end to paint a picture on what's going on.

I loved the Emily and Lorelai parts and that we got a conclusion to their stories. I just hate that ASP made a shit storm of Rory's life and everything came crashing down and now we don't know where the pieces are going to go. I feel like she could of had the that ending without destroying everything Rory worked for. Without trying to make a full circle of the comparisons between characters. It felt like Emily and Lorelai only got their endings.

I would think 10+ years ago the ending would have Rory married or engaged and after the Luke/Lorelai wedding she would make the announcement to her mother of her pregnancy and they'd hug or excitedly bounce up and down together.  This reminded me of one of those hard ending episodes like Richard telling Lorelai they need to talk (about Rory and her needing to go back to Yale). The only other example I can think of at the moment (because it's Rory telling Lorelai something big) is when Rory says she's thinking about having sex with Jess and they sit together on the couch eating dinner and one puts her arm around the other and the other one follows, but that is nothing like this at all.

It seemed to still live in the world of 2007, where the media world could feel the changes coming but didn't yet know how it would effect the industry. There are some throwaway lines, like Luke saying he subscribed to The New Yorker joking about print media not being dead yet. And Rory is struggling finding a steady job, but the show doesn't attribute this so much to the changing field as much as Rory's inability to write the 'right stuff.' 

I'm mostly upset that the show didn't touch on the ways these changes in industry would effect Logan's family business. We know that the Huntzberger family is based on the Sulzbergers, according to ASP. [\(1\)](http://www.vulture.com/2014/05/how-the-sulzbergers-influenced-gilmore-girls.html) Their company is the best comparison for what might have happened to the Huntzberger's over the last 8 years.

The NYT Media Group has lost over half it's advertising revenue from 2002 to 2014. 70% of their revenue still comes from print subscriptions and traditional advertising, which the leaders have acknowledged cannot sustain the group going forward. [\(2\)](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/new-york-times-leadership-succession) It costs about $1.4 billion a year to operate the newsroom. [\(3\)](http://fortune.com/2015/08/06/new-york-times-paywall/)

While attempting to 'pivot' and open new revenue streams, the Sulzberger family has lost over $1.5 billion on poor television and Internet investments. [\(4\)](http://nymag.com/news/media/51015/index1.html) The family lost around $815 million after acquiring The Boston Globe. This quote shows that these losses are being felt by the family:

&gt; All of usmy family and you, our shareholdershave felt the pain of this disruption, he said in 2007, referring to the Times flagging financial fortunes [\(5\)](http://nymag.com/news/media/51015/index1.html)

More recently, the family trusts sold large chunks of their Class-A stocks at only $500,000 a piece. The same stock would've been worth $1.3 million just 7 years ago. It seems likely that the family was lacking liquid assets and sold the stock because of financial struggles. The family has also increased the dividend payoffs despite the fact that the price continues to decline. [\(6\)](http://nymag.com/news/media/51015/index2.html) 

I was really hoping the revival would address the dying industry of print media more. As far as I can tell, Logan's family exhibits no signs of struggling. Logan and his father continue to spend massive amounts of money on frivolities with no problems. Of course, Logan is engaged to some type of heiress, so maybe that has something to do with his ability to still live lavishly? Over all, I'm just upset that the show completely glosses over a huge element of Rory and Logan's lives with barely a mention of the real world implications of their chosen paths.

But this kind of bugs me, because the story spent so much more time on romance and life with her mom than on her career or professional development, to a fault with the character.

He's a guy who needs one woman, one job, one hat (and one shirt during his Trekkie phase). 

Jess is not Luke. Jess is Lorelei. The many glaring parallels:

-They both come from dysfunctional family backgrounds with distant/absent fathers.

-They were rebellious teenagers who dropped out of high school and ran away from home without telling anyone.

-They speak exclusively in banter 90% of the time (the other 10% are evenly split between massaging Rory's ego and thanking Luke).

-They reconcile with their mothers and become responsible later on.

-They hate rich entitled snobs.

-They work blue-collar jobs and live in squalor before founding their own successful businesses.

-They were both rescued by helpful adults outside of their immediate family.

-They are both highly independent, intelligent, unpredictable, stubborn, and creative.

-They go on to create a quirky community around themselves to make up for their family of origin.

-They date around, instead of pine for the one that got away.

-They put Rory on a hyper-idealized pedestal, while having a degree of jokey scorn for practically everyone else.

-They both confront Rory at various times throughout the series to get her back on track by telling her, ""This isn't you, Rory!"" 

-They also both have major communication issues in relationships.

-They even have the same hair.

Rory is Lorelei's one true love throughout the series (and vice versa). If this were real life, I would assume that Lorelei's continued animosity towards Jess was a combination of projection and jealousy. Of all her boyfriends he was the most like herself, and hence the one most able to take her place in Rory's life. 

I don't think this is likely to happen, however. I also don't think Rory would end up with Logan, because she is so passive and malleable, she would be subsumed whole into the Hermes-scented-luxuriant-quicksand-snake-pit that is his life, the way she was when she was planning DAR tea parities. And that is just not entertaining television, past the first few minutes. Maybe.

If they make more episodes, I am Team Rory finally has moral standards and a fully vertical backbone because she has someone else to take care of now and radical-self-absorption-is-my-spirit-animal as a life path is no longer a viable option.

There is so much to say... First of all: I've watched all four episodes with big spaces in between so I could really let each episode sink in. I made a big party weekend with lots of coffee and food. That the musical scene was too long has been said enough now. All the Bunheads-cameos and dancing and singing were really distracting for me, making it feel like a 50 % Gilmore Girls and 50 % Bunheads revival. Thats not what I signed up for. I am invested in knowing more about the GG-characters and spending time on Bunheads really wounded the depth of the story.


What I struggle with is the shallowness of certain stories. GG is many things, one of which is writing really flawed, complex people. I just cant understand the behavior of a lot of people, they are like aliens to me, so strange. Rory feeling no guilt, Logan being so weak for not standing up to his family (and with that totally throwing his growth in S07 in the trash) and the carelessness in which he deals with women, but also Paris who is still obsessed with Francy and Tristan. I know it was a vehicle for showing us her pain about her divorce from Doyle, but I think that could have been told better.


Rory, Paris and Logan are in their thirties, like some of you have already pointed out. Its 2016, not 2006. But in a lot of ways, it feels like we went back in time. Not only do I think season 7 was totally ignored although ASP said she wouldn't (yes, Steve, Kwan and the S07 wedding were acknowledged), I feel like we got a redo of season 6. 
Lorelai and Luke mentioned possibly getting a baby, there are secrets between them, feelings of having lives apart from each other, Lorelai says 'it's never or now' (just like the S06 finale ultimatum now or never) and Luke fighting is just like 701 with a big reconciliation that is 'The Wedding'. It was beautifully done but a lot of witnesses (read: EMILY!) were missing. 

I cried so hard, feeling Emily's heart breaking that she came so close (couple of hours) to seeing her daughter finally opening up to being loved and how beautiful it would have been. I heard her speech of season 7 in my head after she finds out she missed her only daughter getting married :(  (I agree with most that Emily did have a great arc, this was just sad to me)


The Rory/Logan storyline was even a redo of season 5 (open relationship), which is absolutely ridiculous! You can't ruin a character who grew into being a boyfriend to reduce him back to being a shallow 'girls on the side'-kind of guy! Come on!


Its a long way of saying that I am disappointed that they couldnt find a way to tell a story like she would have told in 2007 but then instead happening in 2016. Rorys, Logans, Lukes and Lorelais growth especially seemed to have stood still. I really felt like we went back ten years and that felt really off. Because Emily had something happen to her off-screen (the death of dear Richard), her story did feel believable. I am also surprised to notice how much effect season 7 has on me and feeling conflicted with the fact ASP reassured me that she wouldn't ignore season 7 and feeling like she did.

So, could this mean that we're getting a Christmas special? In hindsight, the t-shirt is a pretty obvious reference to Rory's pregnancy (or is Lorelai pregnant too?). Any theories?

It was the lack of a romance story for Rory. While I appreciate that some people will say that Rory had a romance story in the form of Logan, I'm going to politely disagree, and say that it wasn't a romance arc in any meaningful sense. A romance arc requires a build-up, bonding, time apart and resolution, the Logan line mostly came in the form of a very long resolution. There was none of that Gilmore Girls spark that was present in the build-up to previous relationships, and if we'd seen some of that with Logan at the beginning of Winter, perhaps I'd have felt more sated on the romance level.

For me, I was always Team Jess in TOS, but in AYITL I didn't want a retreading of old steps. I wouldn't have minded nostalgia, as it would be nice to see Rory bumping into Dean, Jess and Logan (though the Dean scene was awkward as hell). In many ways I was hoping to see a man for a Rory of 2016, a man that a 30-something might date (her Max Medina).

In Winter, with Paul came the perfect opportunity to show the kind of man that Rory might have ended up with. The fact that the character was never developed is a shame for me. Not because I felt a great affinity for the man, but because it would have been a great way to show the kind of person that Rory had been. Alas, he was quickly ignored and the opportunity to see a little of modern day Rory's love life disappeared.

Asides from this, there was nothing that stood out for me as like the romance arcs of old. Rory and Logan's relationship felt a little flat. There are a number of reasons for this (Paul, Odette, S4 Rory, the fact they unwrote Logan's development), but the main one was that it didn't fulfil the GG romance style. All of the GG romances were somewhat formulaic, but they were also unique - think Lane and Zac, Sookie and Jackson, Paris and Doyle - they were awkward, quirky and endearing. Rory and Logan's romance arc was just sex and a couple of phone calls. That didn't feel very GG to me.

The fact that their romance culminated in Logan doing something very showy, with his friends... actually summed it up for me. The romance between Rory and Logan offered no character development.

I understand that ASP didn't want it to be about Rory's love life, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been a part of it. The 30-something gang was an opportunity for Rory to meet someone, or perhaps at the school reunion (a teacher, maybe! - given that ASP wanted full circle what would be wrong with Rory dating a Max Medina character?)... Or she could have even met someone through the research for the book or her journalism.

I know that many people wanted Rory to end up with their ""team"", and I had assumed that ASP knowing this would have tried to introduce someone that we might initially hate, and grow to love. Or at the very least introduce a character towards the end where Rory had a little spark... For me GG was always partly about the romance - and the fact it went missing really stood out for me.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

Sookie has always been a free spirit. Changing the menus last minute and coming up with crazy ideas. And the Dragonfly has been open for what 14 years now? That's a long time to be trapped in one kitchen. At some point she's going to run out of ideas. So the idea of her needing a break isn't weird to me, even looking outside of MM's schedule. Her going on a six month sabbatical that turned into two years just seemed very S ookie like to me. 

And honestly, if I can take a detour into theory town real quick,I don't think she would have left them abandoned. Even for her bed rest during her pregnancy she was looking for other chefs. Just none were good enough and then she ran out of time. But if she were leaving on her own terms I would bet she left them with a chef she loved, but when the six months went on too long I could see Lorelai treating them like the rest of the chefs in the revival. I could see her just missing her best friend and suddenly that chef was not good enough, just like all the others after her. And the pop up thing sounded fairly new to Lorelai when she was talking about it to Michel. 

But in conclusion I could see it in Sookie to need a break. I don't see it as a betrayal. And I doubt she left them alone. But the excuse given could have been written a tad bit better. ",7,4,False,self,,,,,

Its long, but please bear with me.

To get there, I should share that I am an unabashed lover of all things spoilery, and that I work a very demanding schedule because I own a bakery. Thanksgiving weekend is a HUGE weekend for us, so I knew I wouldnt have time to partake in the revival until Sunday night. That being said, Friday morning I looked at every spoiler I could get my hands on because I just wanted to know everything.

From all the spoilers I read, I was coming in hating all of it. I hated the final four words. I hated every story line Id read about, I wondered if I was going to be delighted by Kirk and Taylor (my favorites), because there was some weird discussion about them. Then, between last night and this morning, I finished the series. From actually seeing it and taking it in - fuck. It's dead on. I have been crying from about 8:30 last night to roughly noon today, but it's all been a bit pent up anyway. Holidays + personal stuff happening has me as a bit of a disaster, and after the 1st episode, I wondered if I was in the right mindset to take this in right now. But it's been such a good confrontation of it all.

I think the thing with the revival is that it speaks volumes about life, and people (especially people my age - the 30 somethings) can't take that. This whole revival (and a lot of the original run) shows you get what you give. You make shitty decisions, you get shitty outcomes. Just saying you want/deserve/need something will not get you that thing. Weve seen in the 1st go that Lorelei is focused on Rory and building her life. We watch her compromise in her personal life to ensure a good future for her kid, and while shes largely immature about a great many things, we watch her step up to the plate and handle it. In contrast, weve heard countless times that Rory works hard and is smart, and we have never once seen it - we only see people telling her that she is a hard worker and is smart. It just screams of how everyone on Facebook posts that their life is great and their kids are wonderful all the while theyve got a serious substance abuse problem, are mid-divorce, and going to therapy. It's a facade, and all the ones actually working on goals just don't have the time of day to project that shit out into the world, because they're putting their time and energy where it counts.

Id posted about this in another thread, but in talking about the original series, everyone always points out that Lane has so little story and is just kind of the wallflower. But in the new series, she's the same with no real story line of her own, and yet she has this beautiful perfect little life. Sure, shes working for her mom, which isnt what she wanted to be doing as a teenager, but honestly, how many of us are truly doing what we wanted to be as a 16 year old? Does that mean that we have failed, or does that mean that we have matured and found out that maybe what we used to not like is actually pretty damn okay and maybe even awesome? Lane and Zachs house screams of love and chaos and acceptance, and it's so bittersweet because no one can bother to acknowledge that she's made it. And there's Rory, everyone's princess all grown up and she's a fucking disaster. It's almost too real to swallow. I think that seeing the tiny glimpses into her life are what really made this series for me, and I can see why people hated it. The similarities to real life are a bit hard to swallow since the real life seems to be hitting us hard on its own these days.

A lot of people are saying it's a bummer and anti-feminist that none of them had it all. I think that what you want should be defined by your internal compass, not the external ones pointed at you. For some, having a business and nothing else is their everything, some would rather have family and let the rest fall to the wayside, some are happy to be a traveling wayfarer and leave it at that. Dont get me wrong - I dont think that Rory is happy here, but I also surely dont think that this is a portrait of everyones misery. (Especially Emilys! That woman has my heart on a string - she can do no wrong, and I love her more after seeing AYITL.) Do we really want to push out more of these story book happy endings that show ""just have faith and it'll be ok""? That's not real! Not everyone defines having it all as the same thing! People praised the original run as being so real, but now people are appalled. It just strikes me as something that nostalgia can do to all of us, and I think its worth acknowledging.

So, thats my knee jerk two cents. Id love to know what you guys think, and if Im missing something obvious. Ive only been able to watch it once, and itll be January before I have the 6 hours to devote to a revisit.",11,24,False,self,,,,,

- It suffered from ""Arrested Development"" syndrome. They couldn't get a lot of the actors together for various scenes, so just shot them one after the other with just one of the main cast to ""group"" them together
- Where was Paris in the last two episodes? 
- Where was April at the wedding? Paris? Sookie? EMILY? Yes, you say that it's because they did it spontaneously, but Lane was there, Michel, they had a couple. Where were the rest?
- No Liz and TJ?
- Sookie's cameo was so obviously a cameo. Did they just catch her between two movies and got her on a lunch break to film that scene?
- Christopher looks exactly the same
- I liked the amount of Jess in it, I thought he'd just be a token cameo too.
- The Life and Death Brigade scene was the most gut wrenchingly stupid thing I've ever seen. Pretentious, ugly and completely out of character to have a whole hallucenogenic style whimsy to it. A talking bird with no implication that it is anything but real? Ugh. The unrealistic fantasies of dumb rich kids.
- I know that Lorelai going on a hike was out of character intentionally, but her ACTUALLY saying she would go on it in the first place was out of character. Way too unbelievable.
- Rory referencing the show by calling it ""Gilmore Girls"" was nice.
- Emily breaking up with the DAR was superb.
- Paris being a fertility specialist? I can't imagine a more out of character job for her. She's an academic, someone who has better things to do with her incredible talent than get a job making babies. I can't even believe she had kids.
- I might be wrong, but weren't there only three words at the end?
- Even if you insist on making Rory pregnant, doing a cold end like that was stupid. It at least opens up more story potential. This is the end now. We will never get answers to questions like ""What does Lorelai think of it?"" ""Will it be called Lorelai too?"" etc.
- The Paul thing was stupid. You can't be in a relationship for two years and do the stupid ""forgetting who he is lol"" thing
- I hate how nonchalant they are with Rory and Logan cheating. It's out of character (for Rory at least).
- Again, I hate how nonchalant they were about inserting Katy Perry being interested in a house, or Luke knowing Kiefer Sutherland. Imagine keeping that from someone for ten years. ""Wow, better find a place at the table for him. Bye!""
- Rory's fall from grace from being too ""good"" to do the website etc. was great.
- The bit with Jess stealing Luke's hat was the highlight of the entire thing.
- Luke throwing away his integrity to bow down to every one of Lorelai's whims during the argument where she came back from the hiking trip was stupid. I hate when he puts her on a pedastal like that. He is is own human being. He doesn't want to franchise Luke's. It goes against every fibre of his being. Just because you get married doesn't mean you should have to throw away who you are.

According to her, she did so because she felt suffocated with the strict demands of her high society parents. Being an immature teenager, she figured anywhere was better than in the comfort of her own home. With luck, she managed to become a maid at an inn and lived on a shed with her baby that was kindly provided by the inn owner that took pity on her. 


Over the years and with effort, she became the inn's manager and eventually opened her own inn. Lorelai's main goal in life was to provide everything for Rory so she could have a higher education that would help her get her future easier than she did. Lorelai tried her best to keep Rory away from the high elite world she ran away from, but got her hands tied when she realized she wouldn't be able to pay for her daughter's education without her parents help. 


Little by the little, her efforts proved meaningless and Rory went to a private high school and then an ivy league university. Rory met with the elite world anyway. Throughout all this, Lorelai constantly praised and complimented every single little thing that Rory did and told her from the beginning of her life that she was smart and special and that she would surely get anything she wanted. This made Rory incredibly arrogant and clueless about her own limits. 


So where am I getting with all of this? As we have seen from the revival, Rory ended up being everything her mother did not want. Rory's arrogance was a result of the constant praise Lorelai gave her. This praise had the purpose of making Rory believe in herself in an enormous way in order for her to become everything Lorelai was not. She wanted her to be the big fish in a small pond. But I've been thinking, if Lorelai had decided to stay with her parents, let her family take care of infant Rory while Lorelai continued with her studies, would Rory be that way? If Rory had grown in the elite environment she was always meant to be in (and that she would end up entering anyway) there would be have been no need for her to become a big fish in a small pond, as everyone, including Rory, would have been big fishes, and thus such constant praise wouldn't be needed, as it would be a given that Rory would have a bright future. 


So what I am saying is that, Lorelai fought with all her might the future that her parents had for her. She then raised Rory to be arrogant and unaware of herself and sent her off to an elite world she was not ready for. At 32 years old, Rory is unemployed (by choice), homeless, is cheating on her boyfriend, is a mistress to a committed man, is pregnant, and still thinks that the world deserves her. Her world crashes down when she realizes she is not god's gift to earth and that she is not as special as she always thought she was.

So, is Rory's ultimate downfall Lorelai's fault?

The reason I ask is because, in the three scenes they were in together (one with a giant desk between them, the other standing/sitting on opposite sides of the room, the third, a quick Jacket grab and squeal before running inside of the house) there were absolutely no romantic implications between them. It wasn't until the final seconds of Jess' appearance, with 10 minutes left in the episode and a giant wall between them, do we see that after all these years, Jess doesn't seem to actually be over Rory. And the thing is...Amy didn't have to do that. With the earlier scenes that were presented, she could easily have left it as ""They're just friends, everyone's moved on."" but she CHOSE to add that final scene with Jess looking through the window. It just seemed so out of place with how the other scenes between them were, and the fact that it was Jess' final scene in what is supposed to be final episode ever made me wonder whether Amy had bigger plans for Jess and Rory in the storyline, but cut it out, not solely because of scheduling issues (Milo's mentioned that he finished filming the pilot for This Is Us like a week before filming Gilmore) but because Milo and Alexis weren't comfortable filming those types of scenes together. 

And yes, I know that they're professionals and that there are plenty of examples of actors that have been in relationships with each other, break up and don't have problems filming romantic scenes together, but there are also examples where that isn't the case and it wouldn't surprise me if Alexis and Milo agreed to come back and were fine with doing scenes together...as long as those scenes weren't romantic.

Could you ever, *ever* imagine Rory doing *any* of this. The girl who has a tantrum at even the slightest inconvenience. Who is more than willing to live a life of luxury with her rich lover, mooch off all of her wealthy friends and family, and is such a dainty little princess she looks down her nose at taking a job at .... Gasp..... An internet blog! The horror!


Rory liked the idea of being a famous, world renowned correspondent, she just never actually wanted to do the work or take the risks required to become one. If she wanted to be a war correspondent, she could have made it happen. I doubt there are that many journalist willing to go to active conflicts and war zones. If she wanted to go to these places, there would have been a news organisation willing to send her. If not, then she could have used her own financial resources to get there herself like other correspondents have done before her (cough, Anderson Cooper, cough). She could have made it happen. She could have reported from Iraq, Afghanistan, the Arab Spring, Syria - so many places she could have travelled to and made a name for herself. She just didn't want to. 


The more I think about Rory becoming a war correspondent, the more laughable I find it. What the hell Rory! You could have been a contender, you just didn't want to be one.

Rory has a hissy fit anytime anything gets a little bit hard. Can you really imagine her getting up ten times a night to tend to a baby. Nope. Pretty soon she's going to throw a tantrum about how hard it all is and everyone will swoop in to save her. It is going to be Lorelai and Luke who get up in the middle of the night to look after the baby, because Rory will just be too 'overwhelmed' to deal with it.   



Those of you who think that this child will change Rory for the better? That this will finally give her an opportunity to grow and mature? Nope. Don't see it. She's 32. If she hasn't changed by now, she is not going to. She will just throw bigger tantrums from all the stress that she will have to face. It's nice to think that motherhood would change a person for the better. That they will finally step up and be the responsible, caring, kind, selfless person that a child needs. It doesn't work like that unfortunately. I wish it did, but people who are selfish and self-involved before hand, are more than likely going to be the same afterwards. Rory is far too concerned with her own needs and wants to prioritise those of a baby. I seriously see her needing a nanny. She's not going to be able to cut it without one.  



Rory will resent the child because it will prevent her from getting the high flying, jet setting, prestigious media career she always felt she deserved. Even though, realistically, that was never going to happen. If she can't carve out a successful media career after ten years with all the financial support and familial connections she has, it was never going to happen. But the child will definitely be a scapegoat for this lack of career, and Rory will get to complain about how much she 'sacrificed' for the child.   



Rory will also resent the child because it screwed up the perfect life she felt she deserved. Everyone will look down on her for conceiving an illegitimate child with a man who was engaged to another woman. And even if she does end up marrying Logan, everyone will know he only did it because she got knocked up. Rory will be pissed that this baby screwed up her perfect life plan.   



But some hope for the future? Maybe the kid will rebel against her, just like Lorelai rebelled against her mother?

1. Wow. Rory is really acting like a douchebag. She cheats on her boyfriend with Logan, fully aware that Logan has a fiancee. She throws a tantrum whenever her life doesn't go perfectly. She is offered some really great job opportunities, but turns them all down because they are beneath her. But hey, she's a good person. She's just going through a bad time. She'll improve, I'm sure of it!

2. But then, she was like this when she was young as well. She was a cheating, tantrum-throwing toddler then too. I thought maybe it was just because of her youth, but if she's still like this ten years later, this was probably her personality all along. She's not the person I always thought she was. This sucks. 

3. But hey! There's Jess! He could always get through to her. Perhaps if they dated he could remind her what type of person she is deep down and she will become a better person! But that's not going to work, is it. She is not the same girl that Jess fell in love with all those years ago. No matter how much she pretends otherwise, she loves the luxury, high society life Logan can give her. And even if they did date, Rory has turned into such a stuck up, whiny, emotionally self-indulgent snob that he'd probably ditch her pretty soon anyway. This sucks, but really, Jess deserves better. Oh well. Team #Jessrunaway

4. So I suppose that leaves Logan. But he's a douchebag! Rory deserves someone better than him right? Yeah, probably not. She's a douchebag too. But I suppose that could work though? He can give her the life of luxury she wants. And he does seem to care about her. He'll totally cheat on her, but she'll probably just put up with it for the lifestyle. Plus, she can't really complain. She's a cheater too and if she decides to date him she knows what she is getting in to. 

5. Ok, I can live with that. If she does marry Logan, she's going to have a shitty marriage, but hey, if that's what she wants...

6. Drink copiously to accept all this.

I'm 32 myself and if Rory feels half as lost as I do some days then I completely understand why she was unrecognizable at some points.  The world makes you believe that by 32 you should have everything figured out and if you don't then you're a failure. I've had a career for over a decade but that doesn't mean that I don't second guess choices that were made back then. I think Rory is second guessing everything that she's done as well. She's wondering if maybe she took a different assignment, a better assignment, an assignment that got more publicity, would she be in a different or better place.  Things have always come easy for her, she got into an elite private high school, she had her pick of Ivy League university's, the YDN editor job feel into her lap. She's always got exactly what she wanted when she wanted it. She was taught that hard work pays off but so far it hasn't and now all of that is coming into question. She, like a lot of people her age, myself included are just watching their lives pass by trying to figure out how they got to this point. Where it all went wrong??? I feel for her because I have been there too. I have grown up with her. I was 15 in 2000 when the OS first aired and I immediately identified with Rory, because I too was an introvert who was on the quiet side. Someone who didn't let a lot of people in. An old soul. So again I can understand why Rory was making poor decisions. She's looking for something to give her assurance that she made the right choices all those years ago.  

I think her career failures play into her relationship with Logan. Journalism was the only thing she ever wanted to do and when that doesn't work out she runs back to Logan. The one person who makes her feel like she is on the top of the world. The person who makes her feel like no matter the circumstances she can do anything.  He never told her no, never said she couldn't do something. He always believed she was better than she was.  He put her on a pedestal that she desperately needed.  

I know cheating is wrong and I don't condone it in any way but I really believe they didn't think they were doing anything wrong. They loved each and that was all that mattered to them. When it was just the two of it didn't feel wrong because in that moment it was just the two of them. Just Logan and Rory doing what they've always done. I see why she would allow this. I think everyone has had a relationship that in your head you know it's wrong but in you heart you can help it. The fear of having nothing with a person is a far worse thought than only having them part-time. I also think that living on different sides of the globe contributed to the length of this relationship. It's easy to pretend it isn't wrong when most of time you're living separate lives. 

I really believe that Rory is suffering through some kind of mid-life crisis. Yes, it's earlier in life than most, but again she was always been older and wiser than most. 32 years of perfection is causing her to crack. She's making the mistakes now that most make in their earlier 20's (more proof that this story would of better worked during or right after season 7).

In the sense of the show, it felt like maybe Rory had been gone so long, or maybe that she was older now, that warranted a change in their dynamic. But even so, it's assumed that she and her mother are best friends and keep in close touch. Whenever they were shown together, it seemed like they were almost shy around each other. Their tones speaking to each other were so distant. It's almost as if Lorelai saw the person Rory has become and distanced herself. 


In the sense of reality, their relationship and rhythm may just be different because of time passing.

In general, I enjoyed it. There's a lot I'd change if I was In Charge, but overall it was really beautiful. Lauren Graham has not lost her ability to move me the tears. Lorelai is still a goddess.

The story was both helped and hurt by nine years. Mostly, it hurt Lorelai's story somewhat. It's hard to quite believe that Lorelai and Luke have languished in a sort of limbo for nine years. Not that their flaws couldn't lead to that - it's easy to see Lorelai creating a stalemate of sorts that she did not intend with her walls of stubbornness. Still didn't seem quite right. Especially all the kids stuff. I'm glad that the show addressed that overtly in Winter, because I needed to see Lorelai and Luke especially be okay with closing the door on the possibility of them having children. It probably wouldn't have made for amazing television, but after their talk in They Shoot Gilmores Don't They? and the stuff with the Twickham House etc., I wanted Luke and Lorelai to have their kid. I'm sad they didn't get to, and happy that ASP made a point to make peace with that in the revival. The scene where Lorelai and Luke decide to wed was amazing. Lauren and Scott both killed it with their monologues. That scene alone makes their story line worth it. And the wedding itself was magical. ASP crafted the whole storyline so Lorelai and Luke could finally have the wedding they deserved, and it's hard to argue with that when it was just so perfect (especially that shot of everyone stepping out of the Gazebo until Lorelai is alone (because Lorelai will always be just a little but alone) in the falling leaves, radiating her perfect, shiny Lorelai-ness). But still, it was hard to watch that storyline without pangs, without wishing that wedding had been the midway point of season seven and that Lorelai and Luke had gotten to live the family life together.

Lorelai and Emily's story was hard, but in a very satisfying way. Here's where the nine year gap hurts again. Lorelai and Emily were in a relatively good place when we left them. As much as we've seen Lorelai self-sabotage throughout the years, her outburst at the funeral toed the line of believability for me. Everything it led to was awesome, from Emily's take down of Lorelai, Lorelai calling her mother horrible, to Lorelai rescuing Emily from giving up her whole house, all the way to the amazing phone call and Emily the Whaling Museum tour guide. It was a hoot to see Lorelai and Emily in therapy together, and deeply gratifying to see them come to some peace in the end. 

I loved the arc with Michel. After a series where he was so often a second or even third tier character, it was deeply touching to see just how important he was to Lorelai. Lauren Graham was beautiful as she wrestled with that change (though lol timelines - the seasonal structure of the episodes meant that Michel is the slowest quitter ever, having presumably left to look for a job in Spring, gotten on by Summer, and yet still be there in Winter...). Michel's loyalty to Lorelai and the Dragonfly was touching. I ached as he asked her for a spa so that he could stay. From the second the franchise money became a thing I knew exactly where it was going and it was perfect. Lorelai needed something new. She loves what she has and she hates the things she doesn't want to change to change... but she was stuck in a rut and not fitting into her own life (something I think her reaction to the musical - as looooong as it was - really highlighted; for a second I wondered if Lorelai was growing out of Stars Hallow, it was weird). A new, more ambitious Inn will be good for her. My only complaint is that we didn't get a little snippet of her and Michel checking the space out together, echoing Lorelai and Sookie when they first looked at the Dragonfly.

So yeah - overall, the time jump wasn't the greatest for Lorelai's story lines, but Lauren Graham and everyone involved acted the shit out of every plot and it turned out fantastic.

Now Rory. Oh, Rory.

Rory's always been the more difficult Gilmore girl in a lot of ways. Not literally - I mean, Lorelai is amazing and I love her (clearly!) but she's a difficult person, a Gilmore through and through (though she'd make gagging noises if you pointed out how just like her parents she can be). Rory is a product of her mother's world and she loves it, but ultimately she doesn't quite fit. Lorelai and Rory are both very ambitious, but Lorelai's are more concrete and self-reliant. She is building something for herself. Rory's is much more external. She wants to write, but she also very deeply wants her writing to be validated. She wants to be wanted from the outside world. That's very ambitious.

It's not a huge surprise that her success has been limited. Rory is thoughtful and thorough and intuitive and just smart beyond belief... but you could see throughout the series that she does not naturally posses some of the skills needed to be an amazing journalist. Mitchum wasn't entirely wrong in his criticisms. Rory is not especially forceful. Lorelai is a bulldozer - once she has something in her head she will wear you down. Rory has always been more inclined to ask for permission. It's not a bad trait, but tough for someone who seeks to be a capitol-n NEWS journalist. It's not a shock that she gained recognition for an interview rather than an investigative report. She was never going to report from a war zone, but in some ways it's kind of too bad she didn't spend a summer interning for Terry Gross or this American Life, because she could probably do soft, deep stories. It's too bad Naomi was crazy, Rory would be a good biographer.

But that's not how it shook out. And what happened after that was deeply frustrating. On the positive side - I am so glad this time jump gave Rory time to properly fail. I don't mind the idea that Rory doesn't succeed and has to come up with a plan B - it's a great story line for her actually. And her emotions were handled well. The spiral in Winter and Spring was great. That interview was so good because it was do bad. But what happened after that required some suspension of disbelief. 

I'm not 100% opposed to the idea that Rory would want to write a book about her life with her mom. It's meta and not my style, but not a terrible story line. The tension it caused between mother and daughter was great (though oh would I have LOVED four or five episodes to explore that fight - so much more worthy a rift than season six). But as far as plan B's go - Rory, sweetie, your plan B for making money cannot be write a book. Writing your first book is something you do on your lunch break, or at 4 AM when you can barely wake up but you have to so you can have these two hours to write before work. It's not something you put your hopes and dreams in when journalism fails you. The average advance these days is like, maybe $10k if you are very lucky, and most books don't even make back their advance. Or it takes years. If you are broke, and want not to be broke, it's a terrible, terrible plan.

So all and all, Rorys career story started off strong, but became a missed opportunity when it veered into fantasyland and refused to make Rory actually work. (Seriously, if she was a barista while writing, that would have redeemed the story, like, 85% for me; and how cute would Lorelai be if Rory served her a cup with latte art?) There are two things I think they could have done that would have been more satisfying. For one, they really could have had her settle for grad school and Chilton. It would be humbling, but satisfying. Rory would be a great academic and teacher. She could even take the Max Medina route and turn Ivy League someday. Seriously, it might have been her ""I would not have chosen it, but it makes me happy ending. As it stands, her scene at Chilton did serve a good purpose. It made Rory choose to remain independent, very important for a Gilmore.

But a more interesting story, and a better Lorelai parallel would have been to have Rory build the Stars Hallow Gazette into a successful-but-only-by-the-skin-of-its-teeth local paper. One where she gets to make modest money. Would it have fit into the charmed Rory narrative? A little, but after failing a bit it'd be more earned. It would have been satisfying to see Rory learn from her mother and realize that if you want something, sometimes you have to build it yourself. Rory is, as evidenced by the back half of season six when she takes over Yale Daily News, not at all a bad leader. Think about it - she could have hired young writers. Been a mentor on her own terms. Found something useful to do with Ester and what was his name? It would have been nice to see Rory work hard (I must admit, another part of the Gilmore Girls book story line I found frustrating was how Rory described it as easy to write - I want better for you than easy, Rory!). It would have been interesting to see her struggle with wanting to build a life in Stars Hallow when for the last decade she's been traveling the world. And it would have put her in a much better position for her ultimate plot point. Instead, it was just a place for Rory to waste time while the show made some townie jokes. Which is too bad because

Because, you guys, Rory is pregnant. With child. Preggo. I don't love the delivery (ASP, you are a bit of a troll), but I am not at all opposed to the storyline. This is where I think the time jump really benefited Rory. It would have been hard if 22-year-old, newly graduated Rory was pregnant with Logan's baby. (I mean, theoretically the last episode of season seven could have had a time jump, not doubtful.) But it's kind of a GREAT storyline for thirty-two year old Rory. It's wonderful that Rory, Stars Hallow's Rory, is going to be forced outside the conventional. She's not going to get a storybook life, and that might be the best thing that could have happened to her. It might toughen her up. But part of what makes it so great is that she had time to try for the life she envisioned at sixteen. Part of what makes it perfect is that she will be an older (well, over-30s) mom. I couldn't have taken it if she was barely an adult, regardless of the fact that Lorelai proves that you can always make life into something you want. Having Rory get pregnant at twenty-two would have felt like a tragedy. Having Rory get pregnant at thirty-two after her life has gone off track feels like a chance for grace and redemption.

But the job thing does make it harder to swallow. I think you are supposed to get the sense that Rory is writing this book, she's found herself, she's going to be okay. But real life knowledge of how little money there is in books just ruins that for me. If Rory had clawed her way back to stability - and a book just ain't it - then the final four words would have felt like the end of the chapter of the Gilmore Girls, the end of an era as life comes full circle, with a daughter who knows who she is and is ready to stand independent of her mother. As it stands, with Rory's life not at all sorted out to my satisfaction, it feels like something unfinished, a story waiting to be told.

I suppose there's one more thing to stay about Rory's story - would this review be complete without talking about the boys? I actually thought it was pretty well done. I can understand why people aren't happy with the Logan story line, but I liked it. As much as I always liked Logan, he was always deeply flawed. This showed him at his best and his worst. Morally ambiguous with his lack of fidelity, but ultimately caring of a loyal towards Rory in a way I can appreciate. I always had some mixed feels about what their relationship meant for Rory and class - would she reject the lesson of her mother's rebellion and marry rich? This twist on the Logan and Rory story line did a good job of providing Rory with a reason to walk away (as fun as it is for gallivant in a tango bar with the life and death brigade, it also highlights how unnerving it would be to raise a child in that world), while still not damning him completely (he cares).

 As for Jess - I do wonder what they would have done if the story had more space and the actor had more time. Jess and Rory have a lot of potential, but it would take a lot of narrative work to get them on the same page and make them work. It's too much story for a c-plot in the revival. I think Jess's final look at her really was the perfect nod to what could have been, what still could be, but what no one has time for on screen. And Dean... well, it was a sweet enough cameo. ASP always meant for Dean to come across as more romantic than her actually did. I'm not exactly in the ""Dean was abusive"" camp, but Dean was certainly more problematic than her creator will ever realize. Their encounter in the store like ASP set the record straight on what she wanted us to remember of Dean, which I will tolerate because, hey, we're not going to change her mind, and the call back to the pilot was pretty cute. 

Overall, it wasn't perfect but it was pretty good. I wanted more. Of course I wanted more. Didn't you want more? I wanted more of the side characters. All and all the cameos were great, and Paris and Michel got good material, but I could have done with WAYYYY more Lane and Jess and Sookie. (yeah, yeah - Melissa's schedule would have allow it, but I still want it! I also want to know the name of her third kid, kind disappointed they didn't mention it.) I wanted more Gilmore plots. As great as the stuff with Lorelai and Emily was, time meant that Rory's grief wasn't explored much at all (the montage of her walking inside the house was great, but there's more story there), nor was their much room for the Rory and Emily relationship. Luke had some great moments, but didn't get to carry a story on his own, which was too bad (though at least he got a few nice scenes with Jess; I just wish we got some Liz &amp; TJ too!). He also didnt get a solo scene with Rory, which is too bad. There just wasn't enough time to bask in the characters. That's what is great about long season TV series and Gilmore in particular - you have time to indulge in character in a way that condensed format does not allow. The movies achieved some wonderful sequences, they had great fun with the cinematography especially in Fall, but I would trade the cool wedding scene for sixty more minutes of people hanging out, talking in Lorelai's living room.

There were some missteps. The musical wasn't terrible, I can almost forgive its sins because of the song it gave Lorelai (unbreakable indeed), but it went on WAAAYY too long. One weird song in that first scene would have more than sufficed. The Paul joke was funny in Winter, but just awkward everywhere else (the text breakup worked but not enough to justify it). The fat shaming was just sad. But still, I am very glad the revival exists. I am glad I have new, awesome Lauren Graham material to make me ugly cry. I am glad we got to see Rory's life get a little more interesting. I am glad we got to see Emily take a page (unintentionally) from her daughter's playbook, declare the constraints of the life she lived so long bullshit, and move to the sea (though the Berta stuff - also kind of hit or miss). I am glad they did this. I am also happy for it to end here.

#### Perhaps what bothered me the most about the reunion was that GG, as a show, went from _a positive message of achievement and success_ to _a negative message of being stuck in a rut with seemingly no way out_.

In the TV series, the story of the Gilmore Girls is nothing if not a story of success - from Lorelai's success in raising Rory and building her career, to Rory's achievements in school and success at overcoming hurdles in the world of journalism.

I thought that was great. Inspiring even. And it encouraged all kinds of people to read, study, and work hard.

But the reunion?

Lorelai's story turns into one of failures and breakdowns as her social life, work life, and relationships are spiraling downward - to the point that she abandons it all and goes off to see if starting over is a better option.

Thankfully, Lorelai recovers her relationship and shows signs of once again being willing to work hard (asking Emily for money), but it's clear that her life isn't as optimistic as it was a decade ago.

And Rory? Rory, inexplicably, has somehow managed to squander untold fortunes of money, a significant pedigree, her social connections, and most significantly, all of her mother's sacrifices  leaving her broke, cheating without regret, and unsuccessful in life.

**Even still, if the reunion story had taken Rory's struggles and turned it into yet another redemption, then it would be great.** _That's_ the Rory we aspired to see in the TV series. But instead, we only see her continue the decline, losing prospect after prospect for work, being dumped by the world's most forgettable boyfriend, and resorting to affairs that left her pregnant without a plan.

So, all-in-all, I feel like the _message_ of Gilmore Girls went from hopeful to dreadful. **Instead of aspirational, near-idealistic fiction, the reunion turned Gilmore Girls into a cautionary tale with a fatalistic twist of being unable to break the cycle of hardship and struggle.**",69,49,False,self,,,,,

I have a list of disappointments from the revival (some praises too). I feel like after all the progress and character development that was made in season 7, it was completely ignored in the revival. The revival seemed sloppy and too much was going on like the 10 minute musical to include Sutton Foster but not enough of a storyline for some of the bigger characters like Jess, Lane, and Paris. Rory's storyline seemed 9 years too late with her being broke, not having a steady home/job, cheating on Paul with Logan, etc. Luke and Lorelai have been together for 9 years plus their relationship on the OS but haven't gotten married or talked about kids?

Rory has spent the last ten years travelling the world reporting from war zones, natural disasters and political uprisings. She is a grown ass woman. Brave, strong, and awesome. She has achieved all she wants in her career and feels satisfied with her accomplishments. She is ready to return home for a more settled life. Although Lorelai, Richard and Emily were concerned for Rory's safety, they knew that this was her passion and she would not be happy doing anything else. So eventually, they came to support her decision, and were quite proud of all she achieved. 

Meanwhile, having to face the mortality of her only child kicked Lorelai's ass into gear. She realised that she wanted children in her life, and got onto making kids with Luke tout suite. Eventually giving birth to twin sons. Richard and Emily were finally able to be involved in their young grandchildren's lives, having missed the chance to see Rory grow up.  

Rory returns to Stars Hollow, and of course runs into Jess, who is a regular visitor to the Gilmore-Danes household. They reconnect, with Rory laughing, but mostly cringing about all the silly, immature shit she pulled when she was young. She dumped Logan's ass a month after she started following the Obama campaign when she caught him cheating on her. 

Jess has grown into a strong confident, mature man, who still holds a torch for Rory. One look at Jess's bulging biceps and Rory is *into* that. They totally hook up and live happily ever after, having many blue eyed, black haired, snarky babies. Jess is totally devoted to her and follows her around so she can continue to have the fulfilling journalism career she always wanted. I don't know what Jess does.

She and other characters constantly mention that Rory ""broke up with Dean,"" or something to that affect, to try and make it seem like she was the one making decisions, but really she was always the dumpee. The revival may have even thrown a bit of shade on this with Paul. Some spoilers for the revival follow. Let's look at her breakups one by one:

-Her first breakup with Dean was when he said ""I love you,"" she didn't say it back so he broke up with her

-Her second breakup with Dean at the dance marathon when Dean broke up with her because she clearly had feelings for Jess

-Jess leaves for California, ending the relationship by leaving without letting her know

-After Dean and Rory get back together, he leaves her after being left waiting for her at a party thrown by Emily and attended by Logan, who like Jess, Rory clearly has feelings for, and feeling left out of her high society life

-After turning down Logan's proposal, Rory wants to stay together but Logan tells her it is ""all or nothing"" and leaves her

-Means to break up with Paul for at least a year, but is too cowardly/lazy/a shitty person to do it, and he eventually breaks up with her by text

The closest thing we have to Rory ending something is breaking off her affair with Logan in the revival. However that's hardly a real relationship, as Rory is essentially a mistress. Rory even seems keen to continue it if Logan will leave Odette, but he chooses her over Rory. If I missed any breakups lemme know!

However, I then thought about it a little more and it struck me that it is not just Rory and Lorelai that this idea affects. In fact, it would seem that ASP and DP have made almost EVERY character in the show become their parent(s).

Rory who is pregnant and in love with the rich playboy, baby daddy, yet has a hot Danes (Mariano) boy pining after her too = Lorelai.
Paris who is in the midst of a divorce, obsessed with work and has  two kids who love the nanny more than her = her parents.
Lane who is now a mum, living in Stars Hollow, working at the antiques store = her mum (with a slightly edgier vibe, I'll give her that much).
Dean who is now living the Brady bunch, perfect family life with tons of kids and a doting wife = his parents.
Logan who is now working for the family business, throwing money at problems and around like there is no tomorrow and treating Rory (and Odette, and probably other women too) like crap = his father.
Jess who is now level headed, supportive of those he cares about, successfully working for a small business, pining after a Gilmore = his Uncle Luke (who may as well have been his father growing up).

Why do you think the Palladinos chose this route to take? In some ways I like the message that family ties do have an impact and are important. I don't like the idea though that everyone is destined to become their mum or dad and follow their exact path!

1720,GilmoreGirls,t5_2sria,2016-11-29,2016,11,29,21,5fi9tf,self.GilmoreGirls,[Revival Spoilers] My Take on The Gilmore Girls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5fi9tf/revival_spoilers_my_take_on_the_gilmore_girls/,Phanes_Protogonos,1480421034,"ASP and Daniel are back.  The small is big, the big is small, and all is right with the world.   

In this four part revival, theres ballet, tango, a musical, a speakeasy, television, movies, junk food, booze, a frenetic feminist, an affair, a one night stand, therapy sessions, throwback festivals, an aborted Eat Pray Love style simulacrum of the novel Wild that still manages to be successful, cameos galore, Kirks second indie film, New York, California, London, Nantucket, New Hampshire, and small town, Stars Hollow life.  Were given a funeral, a marriage, and a pregnancy, in that order, descending the three generation of our protagonists, the Gilmore Girls.  


Im not going to hold back.  The Revival went beyond what I expected and transcended what came before.  We meet Emily, Lorelai, and Rory when they have all reached major junctions in their lives, and Amy and Dan bring us a story that isnt just the familiar small town comfort and jocularity of Gilmore Girls, but one that also reflects our changing world. 


Gilmore Girls has always been a strange show.  It lives in a borderland where Emmys rarely travel.  All you have to do is hear dramedy and youre already between states, but it is unreal and real at the same time.  The dialogue is played as music, sped into high tempo and pieced together out of hyperlinks and hijinks and yet the plot moves delicately enough to reflect the piecemeal and sporadic development of real life more honestly then most anything on television.  The characters drive this show, and they are so well realized that people are still discovering and loving and talking and arguing about this show 16 years after it began and 10 years after it left the air.  


I had just legally become a man when I began watching this show.  Rory and I are the same age and both Libras and writers.  I watched a young girl read books, listen to music, dream of being a writer and not give a damn  what people thought of her.  I wondered, Where do I find one of those in real life?  Fourteen years later I date actresses in Hollywood.  My life is a Twilight Zone episode, but I digress.  The point is a lot changes from twenty to thirty and therein lay my only trepidation at the resurrection of this series.  I trusted Amy, but I wanted her to take risks.  Ive been talking with a lot of my friends who I make into Gilmore Girls acolytes in a fashion thats much akin to a scene out of Clockwork Orange, and what I only half-jokingly said to many of them is that I wanted the revival to find the Gilmore Girls all miserable.  I wanted A Star is Born.  I wanted Lord of the Rings when they return to find upheaval in the Shire.  Happiness is boring--Luke tried to quote Tolstoy once--and thank god our girls arent.  Life is hard.  Let them struggle.  Let them fight.  Let the audience that had big dreams and lost their way realize that theyre not alone.  Thats how you really live vicariously.  You find yourself adrift and youre thirty and youre life isnt what you thought it would be or it is and youre still not happy, and you see a character youve identified with and their love life looks like your garage, and theyre making mistakes and so, art lets you know youre not alone.  You struggle and you get lost, but theres always a now thats a jumping off point to a new beginning.  Just get your footing and make that first step. 


Rorys storyline is the triumph of the revival.  It not only deals with her failures, bewilderments, and disillusions, but makes her into a conduit and speaks to a whole generation.  Rory is rootless, and shes not the only one.  Theres the 30-something gang.  Were told life chewed them up and spit them out and theyre back to living with their parents.  Rorys living out of boxes and the boxes are in different houses and different countries.  Shes working in a dying industry, has three phones, and no permanent residence; a touchstone boyfriend she doesnt love and barely remembers, and a shallow if exciting affair with an old flame who belongs to another woman.  In both relationships she risks nothing because she has nothing, and that might be why she keeps them in the first place.  No risk, but no benefits.  Not long term anyhow.  Rory has had some success, with an article in the New Yorker and Slate and the Atlantic, but nothing permanent or concrete.  Shes been pestered to join a gossip website, but Rory wants to be in the best publications.  At least until shes desperate enough that her working life mirrors her love life; i.e. - shell take anything she can get.  The thing is, desperate is never attractive.  And this is where we come to who Rory is and how people misinterpret her character.


Rory is entitled and always has been, but most people miss the genesis.  Rory is entitled because shes her mothers best friend.  Lorelai abdicated her authority from the beginning and that left Rory, more often than not, the more sober of the two.  Add to that Lorelai, the Grandparents, and the small town Stars Hollows endless adulation and praise and the hereditary lesson of selfish stubbornness that is the dominant gene of the Gilmore DNA, and she was entitled long before her Grandparents money ever made its way into her life.  The difference is that Amy knows Rorys short-comings.  Rory picks bad stories.  Where Mitchum can trust his gut, Rory cant.  She deludes herself into believing Dean belongs to her, married or not.  She collapses when an experienced man tells her she doesnt have what it takes.  Shes smart when shes given direction.  Shed make a great assistant.  Put her in Chilton and shes floundering.  Move her to College and she struggles and faints Blanche Dubois style onto tall, thin, and safe.  Give her an opinion and she commits a felony.  Put her out into the real world and she scatters and crumbles.  The fact is, shes not even doing badly, but shes unmoored.  Only now Amy is putting her into the context of her generation.  People are lining up to buy things.  Following trends and they dont even know why.  Rory doesnt know why shes there either.  Shes stressed.  Stressed enough to need tap dancing to exercise her frustrations, to try taking a bunch of jobs she has no enthusiasm for and to be put out when shes expected to have a point of view.   But you wanted me!  Im here because Im special, she seems to be saying.


The funny thing is, I still like Rory.  Granted, shes a mess, but, for all the failing, shes looking for a way forward.  Unfortunately shes suffering from bad eyesight.  For the audience though, the signs are clear.  Shes dating Paul, who is infinitely forgettable.  Im convinced its for the comfort.  Hes sweet and she uses him.  In turn, Logan and Rory use each other, though she seems to be on the losing end of that relationship.  This is another reflection on the times.  Rory is in a no-strings-attached relationship.  Theyre all the rage now, only--just like all the lines in New York--no one seems to know why theyve chosen this queue or what theyre supposed to get out of it.  But its in vogue, so line up, right?  Every step down the ladder seems to be a deterioration.  Emily had a fifty year marriage.  Lorelai has a roommate.  Rory has two dysfunctional quasi-relationships.  She even hides Logan from her mother/best friend, who expresses her utter disappointment in searching through her boxes, having thought there would be something fun in there.  Emily sees shes lost.  Headmaster Charleston sees shes lost.  Her underwear and lucky outfit are lost.  Rory, meanwhile, in a series of inept events, ends up crashing and burning through a slew of projects (book and article and job interview) until shes reduced to editing the Stars Hollow Gazette just to get any kid of footing in her life. Even that starts off a failure though, since she tries to impose a small town newspaper into being the New York Times.  Rory likes to try to make people into what they arent.


Its interesting that the GQ editor brings up David Foster Wallace.  Surely the comparison is more jest than just.  If theres one thing that Rory isnt, its DFW.  He could take an article about the Maine Lobster Festival for Gourmet and turn it into an ethical quandary on the morality of killing lobsters or turn an essay for Harpers on a Cruise into a wild dissertation on the paradoxical paranoia-induced discomfort of luxury services manic attentions.  He was a genius, and Rory is decidedly not.  Im sure shes never failed a connect the dots, but I doubt shes ever had a jaw-dropping take on anything.  She did fine when she had a wild feminist with kleptomaniac tendencies and an ironic male dependency issue, but give her a story that doesnt run on stage and announce, Im here! to the world and shes lost.  As she said, it makes good copy.  She asked for the line job without any point of view.  She told the editor shed do it for free and knock their socks off, which I believe is the same thing she told a Wookiee later that night.  


Rory does everything backwards.  She plays life safe and represses everything in the cross-armed, tightly sealed jar of her body until she comes completely unhinged.  She saves her virginity for a married ex-boyfriend and has her first one night stand at thirty-two with a guy in costume while staying in the city with her mother.  Then she promptly tucks her tail between her legs--or is it his tail?--and moves back home where she insists on lying to herself and the whole town that shes not back.  Of course shes not the only one.  The town is full of people that are down on their luck and glued to their laptops, much to Lukes chagrin.  And then theres April, who, as a millennial, might be the most lost of all.  Oh God, was that tasty.  I loved every moment of April.  Talk about redemption.  Shes trying to fit in at college and so shes becoming something she doesnt understand at all.  Shes fighting for weed because its a civil rights issue even though she doesnt like it.  The hole in her nose hurts and Rorys return home is inducing a panic attack as its like a postcard from the real world.  Shes a walking assemblage of liberal arts talking points and its hilarious.  She explains how hard it is to joke right now in college, which seems to be a nice little jab at Social Justice Warriors, and Im positively grateful ASP took it without worry.  These characters are real.  Shes not the only one either.  Doyles review of The Jungle Book takes a 20,000-word detour into the history of African colonialism and Sutton Fosters character seems plenty peeved at her career having not exactly panned out.  Im also happy that Rory and Lorelai commented on Pat, the fat guy at the pool, because, honestly, who wouldnt?  Wearing a Speedo at that size?  No one wants to see it.  Not only does political correctness make comedy almost impossible, but it makes everyone sensitive.  As a side note, you should be shamed if youre fat.  Ive been overweight.  It didnt look good on me.  It doesnt look good on anybody.  Being fat makes you less desirable, lessens life expectancy, and happiness.  You are not a precious snowflake.  Dont be like Rory.   Stop being a victim just to blame the world.  The world owes you nothing.  Your life is what you make it.  If youre with a cheater or youre not in love, then either make a change or blame your own acceptance for your predicament.  This is why everyone is so lost nowadays.  You cant criticize anyone without them imploding and stealing a boat.


Speaking of the unmoored girl, every time Rorys across the pond shes docking at Cape Huntzberger.  And Logan is back people!  What makes an entitled girl feel better than a blank check and an organization thats motto is essentially no rules.  Somehow they translated In Omnia Paratus into Y.O.L.O. instead of Carpe Diem, but who cares, right?  Theyre ready for anything they can pay their way out of.  Look, Ive never been a huge Logan fan, but I remember when he was fun; when he was jumping off ledges, shooting people with paintballs, making side parties, breaking and entering, spraying money around willy-nilly and generally being an ass.  Those of you who liked Logan in Season 7, you were basically Team Paul, only with a chiseled body to get walked on.  He was as exciting as a doorstop.  I wish someone would send that stupid rocket off into space.  Logan always complained while walking through every door his Dad ever opened, because, in the end, Logan loves his entitlement.  He talks his way out of everything.  Hes still at it.  Rory mentions that he doesnt owe her anything because they had a deal, and Logan quickly offers a technically no, as if to show hes going above and beyond.  Hell, the last interaction they have, he says, I dont think shes listening to me anymore boys.  Of course he offers her the keys to the house in Maine, with that ominous echo of no strings attached, which rings of be my mistress for keeps.  Luckily Rory says, every ride has to end, and makes a break of it.  The fact is, Logan doesnt do these big events because he cares for Rory.  Thats why he never offers real sacrifice and emotional connection and thoughtfulness.  He wants the big event.  Hes boosting the tally in the W column.  Hes writing a socialite autobiography.  None of its hard with his money.  And even when he was Rorys boyfriend it came out of ego.  She was about to leave him.  Him: Logan Huntzberger.  No.  You know what, Ill be your boyfriend.  Logan is the modern day fairy tale that ends at the stroke of midnight.   Hes the reality of Prince Charming.  Hes got a jaw line for days and money for eons.  Hell buy you shoes, take off your dress, and marry a French Heiress.  He wants it all.  


And so does Rory, of course.  She wants the unavailable man.  Shes always trying to fill the void of her absent father.


In the end though, its Jess, once again, who comes out of left field and wakes up Rory to whats right in front of her.  Well, you know, except for him.  She misses that.  (which I also think is good storytelling)  Logan sees who Rory can be to him, whereas Jess always sees Rorys potential, and never stops going out of his way to help nudge her in the right direction when she's lost.  Here he presses her to write her own story.  This is everything because Rory should have always been writing books.  Foreign Correspondent?  Dont make me and 18 year old Jess laugh.  Unfortunately, her lack of creativity bears out that shed have to write about her life.  (As a side note, the whole write what you know is a very unwieldy piece of advice.  You couldnt write fantasy or Science fiction or most any of the greatest novels in history if you wrote literally what you know.  Write what youre passionate about is the only advice needed.)  Hell, shes been filling diaries for years.  She can do a hybrid, like Tom Wolfe.  New journalism.  But then, of course, shes also pregnant.  So more than one new beginning on the horizon.  More on that later.


Meanwhile, Lorelai and Emily have other problems.  One of the points that Amys work shows us is that families exist in a singularity.  Time stands still and your problems never go away.  Parents and children are always struggling with each other.  Emily will never forget the fact that Lorelai ran away at sixteen.  It will always hurt.  That story is fossilized in the lineaments of Lorelais face.  Emily never stops seeing it.  In turn, Lorelai is forever running from her mothers influence, hating to face things.  She ran at sixteen and we see her run again and again, usually to men.  She ran to and away from Christopher , Max, Digger, and Luke at different times.  That doesnt change, but in the revival it shifts.  Instead of running to a man and destroying her relationship, which Luke is expecting because he in fact recognizes the pattern, she runs to nature and time and space.  Normally she never waits to think and figure things out.  Lorelai is very lost though.  Her best friend is gone, Michel is about to leave, her daughter is an infrequent visitor, and her father has died, and amidst all that calamity and change, her relationship with her mother has managed to worsen. 


Lorelai doesnt know how to control her mouth enough to say the right thing.  Even at her fathers funeral she doesnt know how to take a step back from her emotions, how to examine them from a different angle or put someone elses needs first.  Lorelai never gave up being a child in many ways, and we see her try to sneak off.  And so, when Emily, hurt, kicks her out of the house, she says, Full freakin circle.  And it is.  But family is always there.  Nothing goes away, but things change.


It strikes me that in Gilmore character development is less a progression then an oscillating zigzag.  When people are weak, they fall back on their flaws.  At one point, Michel lies about his age.  Lorelai calls him on it and he says thats the problem with knowing people too long: they can back-date you.  Well, family can always backdate you.  A mother can see you as a child your whole life, and if your name is Lorelai, shes not completely wrong. 


Lorelai left high society to live as a big fish in a small town.  She left her past behind because she wants to be free.  She wants to craft the way she is seen.  She is a selfish and insecure woman with strong boundaries.  The want of freedom and that fear of vulnerability make relationships quagmires.  The nightmare she has in the beginning of the revival is of a dirty bathroom.  That most private of rooms is dirty.  Lorelai has been hiding her life from her parents for so long that its second nature.  She hid her boyfriends when Rory was young and she hides from and lies to Luke as well, despite her love.  So, as soon as shes in therapy with Emily, the first thing she does is issue a blanket apology.  She doesnt want to go into details.  She hides so much she doesnt know how to communicate with her mother.  Shes pure defense, and so when Rory tells her shes writing about her life, of course she objects.  Its as if Rory is undoing her lifes work.


Both she and Luke arent the best communicators and theyre both stubborn and theyve made a life that reflects that: together but separate.  Luke fixes things.  Its part of the way he feels useful.  He deals with his daughter alone, just as Lorelai does with Rory.  But theyre at a standstill, and so much of Lorelais life has departed from her.  The whole world is moving and shes standing completely still.  But when it all clicks, she remembers a wonderful moment with her father: her thirteenth birthday.  Her best birthday.  Its no surprise that it was a horrible moment, turned around.  And thats what her life is now.  A moment of being lost transformed into a forward movement and connection with the love of her life as they finally get married.  The silent hero her Father was in that moment is who Luke always is to her.  Thats why she loves him.  Because hes always there to fix things, to save her, to catch her when she falls.  The rest can be forgiven.  She can be vulnerable and finally take that next step.


Finally theres Emily.  Emily Gilmore, that most immobile of all Gilmores.  Shes been walking the same circles for fifty years, her whole adult life, and then her husband dies.  Well, theres no way to not change after that.  As Emily says, Sometimes life forces your hand.  This is very obviously the most intense drama of the revival, and really its the catalyst for all three girls, but certainly affects Emily the most.  Emilys whole existence is broken, and she needs to discover who she is without Richard Gilmore for the first time in fifty years.  Its a new beginning she had no say in, and shes cut adrift, as she couldnt help but be.  Rory and Lorelai are both worried and weirded out by her changes.  Shes gone to self-help and is searching for joy in her life.  Shes discombobulated enough to wear jeans and a t-shirt, move a TV into the living room, and allow her maids family to move in, although you have to figure that taps into her loneliness.  Shes lost a certain amount of her fight.  She didnt want to admit she told the painter the wrong dimensions.  Easier to just let it be.  Most of all though, she wants to do right by Richard, and thats why she goes to therapy.  She not only wants his gravestone to be perfect, she wants Lorelai to realize that while he may not have been perfect he was a good man and he did a lot for their family.  Thats the only way she can really put him to rest.  After that she takes the company of Jack Smith, and you cant blame her for wanting that comfort, especially considering the support Lorelai offers.  But we see that Jack is more a stepping stone than anything.  In the end, Emily throws away her old life.  It doesnt work for her anymore.  She doesnt want bullshit.  She doesnt want to be fake.  She leaves the DAR, sells the old house and moves to Nantucket where she finds wind and sea, peace and quiet, more comfortable attire and a maid she finally loves.  Then she takes up a job at a museum: a place where the past is always alive in story, just as Richard will always be a part of who she is, no matter how much time and change has occurred.  Naomi Shropshire explained that she was a whale not a mouse, but the only person with a presence as big as that in this story is Richard Gilmore. 


Near the end, Emily loans Lorelai money to expand her Inn and keep Michel.  Almost the exact words of the pilot are spoken.  Its the same but different.  This time Lorelai isnt asking for Rory, shes asking for herself, and, if you dont know it, thats a huge leap of development for Lorelai Gilmore.  And so, we come full circle.  Twice.


This is the big theme of Gilmore.  Its everywhere.  There are endless parallels.  Rory ran from her mother, just as Lorelai ran from Emily, and in so doing Emily got a second chance to be a mother, and in turn drove Rory away.  The Revival itself is a circle: one year, four seasons.  It opens and closes with Lorelai and Rory in the Gazebo.  I find this to be so prescient in a story about women, whose whole lives work through cycles.  Joseph Campbell wrote the heros journey--you might remember Rory and Paris watching his The Power of Myth during spring break--but it was a very male centric view of the world.  Theres a book called the Heroines Journey by Maureen Murdock.  I wont go too deeply into it, but one of the key differences according to Murdock is that in a mans journey he rejects his mother and goes out into the world.  A woman does the same thing, but in doing so she essentially rejects herself, the embodiment of the feminine principal.  Murdock says that to finish her journey, a woman has to reconnect with the feminine and heal the mother/daughter split.  Men are forever simpler than the human beings that bring life into this world.  Family revolves around women.  So I find it telling that cycles are in such abundance in the Gilmore Story.


For Lorelai, finding a moment of love for her father allowed her to connect to her mother and move forward with her lover.  Richard had anther heart attack, this time for keeps.  Emily returned to being alone and setting out for a new life in a new town, much like her daughter did thirty some years ago.  Rory found herself in her mothers shoes, speaking to her father, ostensibly deciding to follow suit and make a go of motherhood alone.  She went out into the world and then came home, much as her writing did, and both she and her writing are about to give birth to Gilmore Girls.  Logan and Christopher are handsome and exciting and flakey.  Jess and Luke are stubborn, stalwart and pining.  Paris is rich and successful and yet her insecurities come rushing back at Chilton and shes afraid what Lena Dunham will think of her (For my money, one of the funniest jokes in the entire revival given what a hot mess Lena is).  Loreali and Luke decide against having a kid.  Rory ends up with an unplanned one.  Lorelai slept with Chris when he was with Sherry.  Rory slept with Dean when he was with Lindsay.  Rory overlooks Jess, just as Lorelai overlooked Luke.  Jess denies his feelings just like Luke did.  Jess is right under Rorys nose, just like her novel was.  Rorys real name is Lorelai.  Shes the same, but different.  The apple doesnt fall far from the tree.  Were both simple and Freudian, strong and flawed.  Error followed by Error.  Full Freaking Circle.  


I actually guessed the final four words correctly, only the part of me that was hesitant worried that it would be too cheesy.  I missed the idea of full circle.   I imagined Rory was with someone.  Being alone, those words carry so much more weight.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of seven to eight pounds.  But again, its different because shes an adult, and her mom will help her.  


This couldnt be more perfect.  Just from a writing point of view, we dont know whose child it is and thats smart for both intrigue and business.  Who knows if theyll be able to get all the actors again if they want to do another season.  This way it can be Paul, Jess, Logan, or even the Wookiee man.  More importantly, Rory is going to need to rely on her family and we can all only imagine the rain of words that will issue forth from Emilys mouth when she finds out that Lorelai 2.0 has fallen down the same rabbit hole out of wedlock.  In a show that often revolved around stories and books, weve been given thematic bookends.  


If you then realize that Amy and Dan did all of this, including the awkward and lovely cameos of April, Dean, Digger, and Francie, in six months, wrote 600 hundred pages of story while figuring out contracts and adjusting schedules and moving people in and out based on availability, directed all of it, and still managed to give us a story of this caliber man Im fucking impressed.


As for all the quirk, the Musical and the newspaper scene that contrasted Stars Hollow with the world beyond, spouting disdain for Man-buns and all things hipster, that to me is an essential part of this shows charm.  Gilmore never kills its darlings.  Its wrapped in tinsel and chintzy ornaments.  Its dcor is that of Lorelais house.  Theres a farm-animal alarm clock, a singing toy rabbi and a monkey lamp.  Put it in another story and itd be a glaring eyesore.  But then, a Wes Anderson shot in a blockbuster movie would be as jarring as an IED, so who cares?  Amy and Dan had fun and stacked it as full as a Curio at Kims Antiques with set pieces and jokes and cameos.  But thats not all.  The world they presented us with is chalk full of everything, including good old, palpable human drama and a belly full of laughs.  The stakes arent that high, but they resonate like hell.


In the end, Rory isn't a wunderkind, she's the everywoman.  She has big dreams and life has curve-balls.  She's working through them just like every generation before, and every yet to come.

So maybe theres more than one perfect circle of life in this episode. Lorelai once again asks Emily for a loan, and Emily once again asks for visits in return, and that is wonderful. The tradition will endure. But also, perhaps Jess will help raise Rorys baby, just as his uncle helped raise Rory. (Logan always struck me as a Christopher type anyway.) It could happen.

Frankly, I've found the story lines very realistic. 

Rory was very used to getting her way and only working so hard to get her way. The fact that she fell into a rut is not surprising to me. She's a sweet girl but rather self focused and spoiled. 

Lorelai not having another child doesn't surprise me either unless something is completely in her control and her way, she won't do it. 

Personally, I think this revival is a fantastic example of the cycle within families. Emily is uptight, Lorelai even more, and now Rory is taking it further. Is it a little sad, yes but it also offers validation for just about every family with issues out there. The girls are relatable, not perfect. They're charming screw ups. We all recognize ourselves in them at times which is both frustrating and thrilling. 

The revival wasn't meant to be the perfect wrap up but a realistic showing of where the characters are now. I think the writers did a wonderful job of making the characters feel like real people rather than perfectly scripted drones. I think if we're all being honest, this revival shows similarities to the rising millinial generation. A love for ideals, a desire for utopia and a difficulty with reality. 

Anyways, maybe we can all enjoy it more with a second watch through and fall more in love with the Gilmore girls! ",6,10,False,self,,,,,

I will preface this by saying I'm #teamlogan. I don't like that they regressed his Season 7 progress and I don't like the cheating, but I'll let that be for now.

After watching this revival, my heart went out to Jess- but especially after watching his pained glance in the window at Rory and reading all these Jess = Luke parallels.

I can honestly say that Jess getting together with Rory, after she has Logan's baby and clearly still feelings for him, would NOT be a happy ending for him. 

Why do people want them together so badly? Jess is hot and intense and sharp and has great arms and could be a better match with literally anyone. He's sort of a hipster- why isn't he dating women that also hate the bourgeois? Rory clearly doesn't mind it and even gets a kick out of it. Even if fans want her to change back into HS sweet Rory or have her turn into Lorelai, I doubt it could happen and feel like a natural progression.

When Rory was going over the book she was going to write with that English drunk lady (forget her name), Logan had all this intel that he could share. They are on the same wavelength- even though Logan has a bunch of family stuff to work through. I am still gunning for an honest conversation between the two, regardless of outcome. They've been in each other's orbits for over a decade. Rory didn't see Jess for FOUR YEARS!

That would be my version of a happy ending- she tells Logan about the baby and they see what happens. Jess meets someone who gets him, wants to be with him, and he can raise his own child with a woman who only wants to be with him.

Totally. But I have to say, I identified with her SO MUCH. She is a woman in a part of her life where she is concerned with herself, her career, and her relationships. She's always been kind of a terrible girlfriend. God forbid she's human.

Her entire life, she was little miss perfect. Even when she screwed up, things turned out okay because she's Rory and this show is a utopia and why the hell not. I think ASP purposefully made her more *real.* The writers were less forgiving of Rory's shitty behavior this time around, and the audience noticed. 

Revival-Rory is probably my future. I'm a semester away from graduating and I have worked my ass off my entire life. I was never okay with screwing up, not even a little. I was little miss perfect too. But recently, a LOT of screwing up is going on. And it's not okay, I'm not making excuses, but I hate seeing ""Rory is the worst"" because I know that most women go through this. Most *people* go through what Rory is going through. 

I think ASP knows how unlikable Rory was this season. She's turning the mirror on girls like me who grew up watching the show with mom, wanting to go to Yale just like Rory. I think she's saying, it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to not do what everyone thinks you should be doing. It's okay to screw up as long as you learn from it.

Now that Rory has someone else to live for, I think it symbolizes the shift from living for herself as a typical, self-centered, 30-something-year-old woman, to a mother. And if you can't see the Loralai, full-circle type parallels there...

Maybe the revival was a bit more realistic and dark, but I put that on the limited amount of time they had and I for one am happy we got to see things in this way. And the OS always has a bit of darkness underlying in it as well. It wasn't this feel good, optimistic show people seem to remember it as.

I personally enjoyed the revival. It was funny, emotional, slightly problematic and frustrating at times... everything Gilmore Girls is supposed to be. People saying that this was a completely different show, that they hated it and it ruined the OS for them are way off base imo.

I realized this morning that I don't know how I'm going to fill my free time now. I'm a sophomore in college, so for over a year I've been in the habit of studying till late, then watching two episodes of GG before bed. I used it to motivate myself. I could keep doing that, but somehow it feels wrong after watching the revival. I don't want to mess up the finality of the thing.

I thought I should find another show to watch, but nothing has ever resonated with me like GG. Should I try to forgo TV for a while? Take up guitar? How should I spend my time? Then I realized: Gilmore Girls has provided a thousand answers to that question. The show is a flood of references. Some I got, some I didn't. The objects of those references are the things that made Amy who she is, and by extension made the Gilmores who they are. 

Before, each reference I missed was a failure, a moment I couldn't fully share with the characters. But there's another way to see it. Each reference is a door to a world I would never have encountered without the show: 80s coming-of-age films with Molly Ringwald, Metallica vs The Offspring, Lifetime movies, the Bangles, the Ramones, Abbott and Costello, and a million more.

Is she hoping a network will pick up Gilmore Girls 2 (the story of Rory and her daughter)? The original series was fresh and uplifting, putting single-motherhood in a whole new light for the early 2000's. Here was this brave young woman, Lorelai Gilmore, and she raised her little girl all by herself, to be just as well (if not better) adjusted and successful as any other child of high society. Look at her loving her child, giving her space to grow and understand herself; what a great mom! Yes, the original series showed a perspective where tradition was not the end-all be-all of life, and essentially functioned as a modern version of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. It was good. It was warm and friendly. 

The revival, on the other hand, seems to have undone the work the original series did. Let's watch this otherwise well-cared for girl do nothing in life, wander aimlessly, serve as someone's mistress before getting herself knocked up. There goes Lorelai's efforts to give Rory a better future, not to mention any respect high society has for Lorelai. I can already hear Shira Huntzberger saying ""like mother, like daughter"" before giving Rory an ""abortion or we sue for custody"" ultimatum (since Rory is broke.) When the original series ended, Emily and Richard said that the Rory-party was not only for Rory, but also for Lorelai's efforts. ""You did this. You built this.""

Rory has some pretty obvious issues from her inconsistent relationship with Christopher, and while everyone is dissecting her boyfriends and who she should have ended up with, I think we're overlooking a big part of her problem. I mean, when I look at Rory as a young woman, it's obvious from the storyline of her romances that there is a big need for male attention once Dean and then Jess come into the picture. I'm not sure if Amy and Daniel meant to write it in this way, but look at how she wanted Jess' attention when she was with Dean and later when she wanted Logan. I feel like part of the reason she's been a cheater and co-conspirator in her romances is because she has these residual issues left over from a deep desire for a more prominent father figure. Maybe that why she has such a hard time letting go of Logan, because he is often times very literally taking care of her. I mean, she's even unconsciously calling him at the end there.

She didn't have the passion to go out and find stories. She was just wandering aimlessly waiting for someone to tell her what to write about. She was excited about getting her name in print, but not about any stories or leads. So, that career wasn't making her happy. Even at the Start Hollow Gazette, she wasn't excited about finding stories to write, she just wanted the paper to get out. Newspapers aren't the right field for Rory.

Cut to the book thing. I do think having her write a book about her life is an overused trope in chick-lit, so it feels trite in this show as well. However, this is about trying to see the good. So, Rory says nothing has been easier for her to write than this. It just flowed out of her. She finally found something she *wanted* to write about. She found the passion she was missing, not just something to fall back on since journalism didn't pan out. I don't know what she'll write about next, but given what an avid reader she was I'm going to imagine that she will be a better novelist than journalist. I'll hope that after her memoir she'll write other books, and they'll be good books. And she won't have to do interviews or find angles on stories. She can be the introvert she is instead of pretending to want the life of an extrovert. 

Finally, the pregnancy. I can't remember exactly what episode, but remember when Lorelai and Luke go to talk to the Stars Hollow High kids about their jobs? When the kids start asking Lor about how she got pregnant and was a single mom, Lorelai struggles to answer because, while it derailed her life and she doesn't recommend teenage pregnancy, she loved being a mom and she loved her life. She said something about how she wished she had been a bit older when it happened. Well, that's exactly what Rory got. She gets to have her own kid and be a single mom, only in her case she already had a ton of other experiences first. She got the Yale degree. She traveled. She saw her by-line in various awesome publications. She has a decade-plus of awesome experiences under her belt. Settling down with a kid now isn't horrible.

Two problems: she's got no home and she didn't *choose* to become a mom. That's unfortunate. I would really have loved, for once, to see a planned and wanted pregnancy rather than yet another in a long line of accidental pregnancies (Rory, GG, April, Lane's twins, Sookie's third kid, now Rory's kid). She's 32, that's a great age to have a kid. Why not let her choose that rather than forcing her into it accidentally? But on the house front, I'm sure she'll be ok. Even if her trust fund is dried up, her grandmother is loaded. 

So, I'm just going to pretend it was a happy ending. She gets the life her mother always wanted: exactly the life Lorelai had only a little later on with a few big experiences beforehand. The difficulty is that it was presented as a long spiral to the bottom for her. One failure after another. So even though this pregnancy and new career path are (maybe?) meant to be positive, it still feels like a failure. Again, because she didn't choose it. ",6,1,False,self,,,,,

So, first off, the entire LDB has been one of my most favorite Gilmore Girls story lines. They were classy, but reckless and selfish, but caring all in one. Especially Logan. Here is Logan this total frat boy who's wrapped up in himself when he meets Rory and he just has to have her. I'll have to admit that I didn't expect the LDB in the revival. I knew that the actors playing Colin, Fin and Robert would be back, but in no way did I think that it was for some serious LDB business. 
Anyway, this scene, which I read took over 3 months to shoot was one of my most favorite scenes in the entire revival. Rory and Logan together doing whatever the fuck they wanted with no boundaries is how I've always pictured them. I always feel like Rory is her best when she is with Logan. She is the most comfortable and the most confident. I feel like part of her reluctance to being with Logan at the end of season 7 and even throughout the revival is partially Lorelai. Lorelai doesn't believe in the life of money and trust funds and it's never something she imagined for Rory. 
In the OS Emily makes a snide comment when she insists that Rory and Richard go to the club to golf together- Lorelai is stubbornly trying to get Rory out of it because ""They won't have fun"" but then Emily pushes that ""Maybe they won't, but maybe she'll like it"" and goes on to say that maybe that is why Lorelai is so reluctant to let her go. So, she lets Rory go and Rory has a great day with her grandpa. Fast forward through the series, Rory moves into the pool house where her grandparents take care of her. They completely remodel the pool house and they're taking care of her while she does her community service from the stolen boat fiasco. Then Rory moves in with Logan where he takes care of her and so on and so forth. 
Rory likes the life of money. She likes being taken care of and here is Logan who flew all of the way from the London to be with her one last time (yeah right) And he does it in the best way. He plans this entire evening from the computer to the talking bird in the tree all the way to buying an inn just so they can do whatever the shit they want to. He pampers Rory because he adores her. 
And then, the final goodbyes between Robert, Colin and Fin were probably some of the most bittersweet in the episode. 

Oh Logan... oh LDB.

Original work after years of nothing, from someone who is an absolute master.  So we get this book, and we see some *amazing* landscapes.  Breathtaking and reminding us of just why we love his work in the first place.

And then we turn the page, and there's an odd, out-of-focus picture of his kitty.

Huh, that was weird.  Turn the page, and once again, we see an amazing landscape, that captures the intense beauty of nature, and perhaps in a way that makes us weep a little, that we had never seen nature like that before.

And then in the middle of the book there's a 32-page spread of pictures he took of a play he re-enacted with Chuck E. Cheese animatronics that were in a previous book that no one read.

But then we get back to the amazing landscapes, including one that makes us *so* grateful that we get this one last glimpse into how the author sees the world.  Amazing!  Wonderful!  Superb!  Thank you so much!

And then the last picture is a selfie, with a magnificent landscape in the background, like we might see that in the future, but right now all we see is him, slightly tilted, with his thumb obscuring part of the camera.  And that's the end of the book!  There is no more to be had!  How do you end it like that?  And what was with the animatronics in the middle?  Or that weird montage of food pics?  Why did we spend so much time on seven weeks of ""My Tour of Grilled Cheese Sandwiches"" when we could have seen more of the American Southwest?!?

**TL,DR**:  It's the unbelievable highs of the Revival that are really making it easy to get mad about the intense lows of the Revival, making it difficult to see the good.

So I will be grateful for the good things, the ""beautiful landscapes"" that made my heart leap with joy at the time.

* Luke and Lorelei have been together for years, and they finally did get married (sheesh!)
* Nearly every scene with Emily in it, but in particular...
* Emily telling off the DAR and...
* Emily at the Whaling Museum, finding happiness in a post-Richard life
* How well they treated the grieving process for Richard Gilmore (and in turn, I imagine, for themselves over Edward Herrmann)
* Lorelei's favorite birthday
* Paris will always be Paris, neuroses and all, no matter what age she is
* Luke having fun with the wi-fi password
* Jess coming back and taking care of Luke, just as Luke took care of him before
* Kirk is still Kirk, and Lulu still loves him
* Luke is Kirk's big brother (you can see little signs of that)
* Kirk can do great things if he wants (the wedding decorations)
* The Secret Bar (""FIVE-OH!"")
* Lane and Zach playing at the Secret Bar
* Michel loves Lorelei enough to put off moving on in his career
* Lorelei loves Michel enough to get a bigger inn
* The fact that Stars Hollow is still very much Stars Hollow

These are just a few of the landscapes I will be focusing on, when I remember the book that is ""A Year in the Life.""  At least that's my hope.

I think Jess was utilized perfectly.  Jess has always been impactful, if infrequent.  Think back.

Arrival plus Dinner and felony in the margins.  Chalk outline.  Bracebridge dinner sleigh ride.  Basket bidding.  Rain gutters talk.  Delivery of Luke's takeout.  Tutoring and Car Crash.  New York Day trip.  Kiss at the wedding.  

Season three:  

Doose's did-the-mailman-lose-your-correspondence argument.  Fixing and unfixing the sprinkler.  Who devil Eggs a car?  Dance Marathon.  Then you have the actual relationship. 

Season Four:  

Stop Running.  I love you.  /  Come away with me.

Season Six: 

What's going on with you? This isn't you, Rory. / It is what it is.  You, Me.

AYITL:

You're a Contender.  You should write a book about you and your mom. / Eyes through the window.

But they are two very different shows so going into the revival I didn't expect to see such similarities in the theme. In The Sopranos a major aspect was how the characters were destined to be what they were. There was no changing them, no matter what happened they couldn't escape the influence of their families. 

GG went a similar direction having most to all of our old favorites first fighting, but then eventually turning into their parents (particularly Rory). No matter what plans they had or which direction they went. TS started off with the main character in therapy cause he was having panic attacks. GG, although both drama and comedy, started out with lighthearted jokes in a local diner. It would tug on your heart strings and touch on real issues, but in the end the show always seemed to have a positive outlook. Now at first, to me this seemed to be a split between the tone and the message. If GGR is going with the theme of inevitability, naturally the message you take from that is ""Why try to change? You will eventually become whatever you tried to avoid."" Which just seems out of place for GG. It fits for The Sopranos, a show which opening scene was a therapy session for a criminal who didn't want to be there in the first place. 

But then I thought that kind of sounds like Lorelei (minus the bit about being a criminal..). She had to be forced to go to therapy and her main issues to discuss are issues with her mother and being a Gilmore and everything that comes with that name. Tony's main issues involve his mother and being born a Soprano. 

Tony doesn't want his children to get involved in the family business but both still end up involved in their own way. Lorelei doesn't want Rory to follow her footsteps and end up a single parent which she still does.

For bonus points both have an [epiphany](https://youtu.be/Bphku5Q2aRM) that took them several TV seasons to get to. And they both have it in nature, which both characters are rarely in. 

Am I thinking too much into this? I think I am...Okay well besides the Soprano comparisons, having this message still seems like a downer on a show that's made me laugh and smile so much. Even if this was always the plan for how it should've ended (which I'm not too convinced of yet) it is still pretty depressing. Now going back to some older episodes, seeing Rory &amp;Lorelei's similarities goes from being ""Aw, thats cute. A little dysfunctional, but it's all love."" To being ""This is sad, Rory is doomed."" Which is why although I see it, I feel a disconnect between the tone and the message which I didn't feel before watching the revival. It feels like it fits but doesn't fit at the same time. The revival has put an Official Serious tm blanket on the rest of the series for me and retroactively made it less funny and more tragic. I guess this is a dramedy thing...
