Lorelai and Richard are having an argument about her failed date with Peyton Sanders, and Richard is telling her an anecdote about a woman whose check bounced for the Winter Formal. This resulted in Emily receiving the first cup of tea at the next DAR meeting. However, because of Lorelai's faux pas with Peyton, Emily's tea spot is now jeopardized, and Richard says: ""I may not understand it, but in her world, it is very VERY important that she have the first cup of tea. ... If my wife wants the first cup of tea, she's going to have the first cup of tea.  That's it!""

I just always found this so endearing that Richard felt so passionate about Emily's happiness despite the seemingly trivial nature of the issue. Moral of the story: find yourself a partner who will get you that first cup of tea.

At some point, shouldn't she wonder whether she is the problem? Examples:

1. She got priests to come talk to Lorelai 5 times about abstinence. Lorelai got pregnant at 15. So what does Emily do to try to prevent Rory from having sex? That's right, brings over a minister to talk to her about abstinence

2. She tries to control Lorelai's life while living under her roof. Lorelai runs away. What does Emily do when Rory comes to live with her? Yep, tries to control her life (to the point where she wants Rory to eat a freaking muffin exactly in the spot Emily wants her to eat the damn muffin). Is shocked when Rory leaves similarly to Lorelai.

I get that Emily thinks she is always right and knows best, but when past events clearly show that was not the way to go, I would think she'd be smart enough to not try to act the same.

Going on a tangent, the reason I appreciate Lorelai so much more is that she is willing to relent and doesn't stoop to the same level Emily constantly does. 

*When Lorelai dates someone Emily doesn't want her to date (Luke), Emily plots to ruin the relationship. When Rory dates someone Lorelai is not thrilled with (Jess, Logan), Lorelai respects Rory's choices. The way she backs down regarding Jess is noteworthy and something Emily wouldn't have done in that situation (I really believe Emily comes around Luke only because both Rory and Lorelai aren't willing to put up with her bullshit).

*When Rory runs away from home in S1 and leaves in S6, Emily tries to prevent Rory and Lorelai from making up (S1) or makes no effort to help them reconcile in S6. She is gleeful especially in S1. When Rory cuts the grandparents off, Lorelai insists they go back to FND and helps them overcome the fight, so they'd still have a relationship and doesn't gloat like Emily did.

*When Lorelai finds out her decorator used to be Emily's, she's determined to fire her but after discussing with her she is willing to change her mind. When Emily finds out, she gets the decorator fired and doesn't give her a job ever again either, because she's that small of a petty person.

**That Damn Donna Reed** - Dean and Rory fight about his approval of the 1950s, pearls-and-meatloaf domestic antics of Donna Reed, which prompts her to set up a meal in this light when she cat-sits for Babette. Lorelai admits to Emily she might have feelings for Luke when Emily pesters her about her and Luke's friendship.

I don't *think* there is anything to actually contradict that in the series, but do speak up if you spotted something.  Rory and Logan keep away from each other's other partners, but don't talk as if they're ashamed or need to be secretive.  Rory doesn't tell Lorelai...but throughout the entirety of the original series, Lorelai had very strong ideas about what Rory should be, and that included being a good monogamous girl.  I don't think Lorelai would be sympathetic to the idea of polyamory, even ethical polyamory, so it makes sense to me that Rory wouldn't share this with her.

I like to think that Rory realised monogamy wasn't really for her at some point between the end of the original show and year in the life, having reflected on her own romantic history, and decided to make her own decision about what she wanted her love life to look like.  It's one of the few things she wasn't pushed into (willingly or unwillingly) by her mother, and I see it as evidence of how they've grown apart over the years, in a healthy way.

Who do you think is to blame? 

My opinion, all of them (not nearly as much Richard though):

The reason Lorelai kept so much from them is mostly because of Emily. Nearly every time Lorelai told Emily something about her life, Emily had something nasty to say. If you know those are the type of reactions you are going to constantly receive, you'd probably keep certain things to yourself too. If Emily &amp; Richard were more understanding and accepting of how Lorelai was/lived her life it would have been an entirely different dynamic. Not 100% I am sure, but not nearly as bad as it was. 

Parents completely always want what's best for their children; but that doesn't necessarily mean that what the parents think is best IS what's actually best. The example I am going to use here is Luke.

In the kitchen of the Gilmore's there was a conversation about if Lorelai liked Luke. Lorelai never really thought about it, and decided to answer her mother honestly -- which then she was rude about it: ""what on earth could you be thinking?"" Now Lorelai wasn't hiding that from the Gilmore's, if anything she was hiding it from herself and/or hadn't thought too much of it.

They felt he wasn't good enough, and didn't come from good breeding. That's hogwash. He didn't come from a money background or the same background, but money and status has nothing to do with the way you treat a person. Luke had his faults, but everyone has them. He was a stand up man, who loved Lorelai (and Rory) very much and have done everything for them. Don't get me wrong, I love Emily. I didn't when I was younger and do now and agree with a lot she does, but also disagree the same.

It's honestly the same way with Lorelai. I said it before and I will again: It was all about communication. Not only that but one key thing: understanding and acceptance. Even if they didn't agree with one another, they needed to respect each other's decisions. We all think differently, and sometimes you truly do just need to accept, understand, and move on -- even if you disagree.",50,25,False,self,,,,,

Its been awhile since Ive rewatched so I was about as fresh as I can get at this point. I didnt want Deans ending to skew the beginning thoughts as much. At one point he was the perfect boyfriend but, as we know, he ends his main run on the series as a loser. I fully expected him to be the new Kirk in the revival so at least he faired better than that.

Since Dean gets a lot of criticism, I also tried to find the turning points that triggered his negative traits. He had a serious hyper jealous streak, a controlling/demanding nature and some violent outbursts (could be attributed to teen testosterone?).

He was also very giving and caring - I think his ultimate desire was to care for someone and, in return, have their undivided loyalty and attention. I hope his wife and kids give him that now, he looked really happy as revival Dean so I think hes living the Dean dream.

This is not every episode or every episode Dean was in but I tried to pick some key moments and only edited out a few redundancies...its still pretty long. 

Without further adieu, The Rise and Fall of Dean


S1: The Rise of Prince Charming

Rory's birthday parties: my heart skips a beat at the perfect way dean mouths happy birthday to Rory as he leaves Luke's. this is also the episode he shows up at her house and gives her the bracelet for her birthday. Cute teen romance junk.

Kiss and tell: the cornstarch and first date with dean and both Lorelais. It's demonstrated Dean knows rock music, Disney, he smells good. He has a kinda smart mouth but it isn't enough to get him popped by Lorelai. But overall he's really nice. The teenage girl within me gets all gooney eyed this episode.

Rory's dance: Rory calls him a gentleman caller! It's great. I love that Rory kinda initiates their relationship and it's awkward and she babbles. Dean doesn't really want to go but he goes anyways - the first in a long pattern of Rory making him do things he doesn't wanna do. I didn't watch the show then but I do know that dream boyfriends look very similar to Dean. He's protective but when sleezes Like Tristan are around that's the kind of boyfriend you want imo.
*SIDENOTE: Rory has some sick burns to Tristan and Paris in this episode. LOVE IT!

Paris is burning: deans call volume is revealed. Five times in a night isn't a high but considered respectable - oooookay then.

Starcrossed Lovers and Other Strangers: Dean has read Ana Karenina at least twice...for Rory. He also announces he's going to build her a car after taking her on an extravagant date. Now this is a controversial moment - Rory's talking about how perfect everything is and Dean says he loves her. Now when Rory doesn't respond I don't think dean was mad she didn't say it. I think he was dealing with the fact that he loved a girl who didn't feel the same. I think he just thought she felt the same and was wrong. He was mad but I think it was from heartbreak. It was the 16 year old version of Logan's proposal - all or nothing.

S2: The Stagnant Reign

Hammers and veils: another controversial moment - Dean is kinda needy, he really wants to hang with Rory and wants her to ditch her volunteer work. This is the first instance where we see Rory putting other things before dean and he gets upset. It's annoying but still understandable - also they did make plans and she blew him off. They fight and they both storm off. I'm not gonna fault Dean for wanting to hang with Rory and I'm not gonna fault Rory for wanting to focus on her future. I think they could have reached a compromise (maybe hang out while researching junk) - this is the first in a long pattern of Rory's to put herself and her goals ahead of her relationships and expect her guy to be waiting around when she wants him again. She also gets mad at Dean for NOT being okay with constantly waiting for her. Dean gets a lot of flack for this episode and this episode is noted for him being controlling but it's definitely a two sided dilemma. Dean does apologize pretty quickly too - they're conversation at the end of the episode I think upholds him for the moment as a good boyfriend and Rory as a driven teenager - she even acknowledges her tunnel vision and Dean neglect.

Run away little boy: Tristan comes to stars hollow and it stresses Rory out. She doesn't want freak Dean out or spill her secret that they kissed. Dean gets a lot of crap for this episode too. So Tristan a prissy rich boy harasses dean at work and makes a mess just to be mean. While Dean does look like he wants to rip Tristan's head off that isn't transmitted to Rory - he almost immediately calmed down when she pulls him aside. Dean is old-fashioned but not abusive.

So before this episode Dean keeps up his ability to read books Rory recommends and they have good movie references together BUT once Lorelai does her Dean impression suddenly he's into Monster truck rallies? Lorelai doomed him with her impression of him as a dunce - they wrote the dunce impression and then got the pages confused with his actual script and just built on his character from there. Poor guy he got watered down for the sake of being written off...slowly and painfully.

Bracebridge Dinner: apparently dean hated jess before he started lurking around Rory. Every episode they seem to be transitioning him up to be the white hat cowboy when he started as tough and mysterious and ""not a joiner."" We see his first jealous glance as he witnesses Jess and Rory exchanging a very obvious look. This is the first chink in their relationship.

A-Tisket a-tasket: Dean's jealousy drives him kinda crazy. He goes to Rory's mom which is questionable and annoying. While obviously his worry about Jess is warranted and proves to be true he has some deep seated self esteem, jealousy and control issues. I get Lorelai is different but he went to his girlfriends mom...Not. Cool.

He does make a Monty python reference so he's not lost all his personality yet.

Lost and found: cracks in the perfect relationship - Rory gets inordinately annoyed with lord of the rings and dean gets inordinately worried she's Not wearing her bracelet...that she hasn't noticed for weeks.

There's the rub: Dean's pretty furious and makes an ass of himself. Level headed ppl would have held it together and given Rory a chance to explain the shenanigans at her house with Jess and Paris but Dean is a teenager driven mad with jealousy. Honestly it's pretty obvious Rory and Jess are into each other. Rory's just an emotional toddler and doesn't realize it.

Back in the saddle: Dean leaves at least 14 messages for Rory...that is all.

Help wanted: there's an obvious pattern of Dean not handling other dudes at the watering hole very well. Once they leave, he's fine but he can't take the competition. Maybe he shouldn't have chosen the main teen character of a WB show if he didn't want her to be an inexplicable guy magnet.

I can't get started: theory confirmed once Jess is gone, Dean is fine. Just like when Tristan left, Dean was fine.

S3: The Fall

Lazy hazy crazy days of summer: Dean wrote Rory at least once a week for her time in Washington and they finally get reunited even tho shes been thinking about Jess the whole time. A letter a week aint bad, its pretty standard imo. Theyre cute and hes tan and Rory decides shes gonna give him her undivided attention.

They shoot Gilmores dont they: We surprisingly dont see dean a lot this season until this episode. We hear about him and we see Rory weighing whether she loves him or not almost every episode but hes kinda out of the picture already. And then theyre done and its very public and humiliating.

Deep fried Korean thanksgiving: Dean threatens Jess and tries to pick a fight in the street and he looks insane. Hes violently jealous. RED FLAG

Thatll do pig: Its obvious that several months have passed since the last episode and Dean has evidently moved on and is no longer scary jealous- Hes obviously trying to steal Rory back so its not too much better. To improve himself hes gotten into college Go Dean! Its also revealed that while Rory cant just get Jess to go to stupid things with her he will go if her exboyfriend is lurking.

Face-off: Dean waves to Rory at the hockey game instead of his girlfriend...who hes apparently gonna marry in a year or less...you would think he would know how it feels to be with someone whos into someone else and give Lindsey his undivided attention like He wanted Rory to give him

Goodnight Gracie: Dean is once again established as the white hat since he came and cleaned up the mess him and Jess made while fighting over Rory...in front of deans gf, soon to be wife. The writers orchestrated this whole thing partly to juxtapose Jess and Dean as bad guy, good guy once again.

He, later this episode, asks Lindsey to marry him and immediately goes and tells Rory and is obviously seeking her approval. This suddenly happens before he even graduates high school and less than a year after dumping Rory!!

My theory for this is that he and Lindsey got in a fight after the party and things were rocky bc her bf got in a fistfight with his ex-girlfriends and first loves boyfriend. This is another juxtaposition with Jess - while Jess isnt growing up fast enough by graduating and he kinda screws up as a bf by not talking to Rory and not taking her to prom; Dean is getting out of hs and growing up too fast by getting married almost immediately after. Neither method was immediately successful.

S4: He aint dead yet...

Chicken or Beef: less than a year after breaking up with his first love, hes getting married...at 18...and invites Rory. I didnt even need the scene where he drunkenly sleep groans Rorys name - boy is not over the girl.

The Incredible Shrinking Lorelais: strike 1 - dean calls a woman whos not his wife for approval on a job. strike 2- he gets all gooney eyed while talking to girl whos not his wife AND ex-girlfriend.
Strike 3- he embraces her while she cries.

And Im willing to bet he doesnt tell his wife about any of these encounters with Rory. SHAKE MY HEAD!

Scene in a mall: Dean isnt at rock bottom yet and thats whats truly sad about him repeating to himself and others how great things are even tho Lindseys still basically living with her parents and driving Dean out of their house until its time to play house and have sleep overs.

Last week fights this week tights: Dean has some incredibly stupid bangs. Rory also notices how hes out with his ex and this should definitely not be okay. He then storms off in jealousy at the sight of Jess much like he did just over a year ago ya know when they broke up! 

S5: The Bottom

Say goodbye to Daisy Miller: Dean and Rory sleeping together I think was a turning point for both characters. For Rory its the first of a series of selfish relationship choices and failures. for Dean its gut wrenching. He goes home and takes his guilt out on Lindsey who tries desperately to start conversation, defends herself for normal actions like answering her husbands phone and begs Dean not to fight and Dean just yells at her. Lindsey deserves so much more!!! Deans behavior is textbook adulterer - Ive read that their guilt eats them up so they try to retroactively justify their actions by creating problems and starting fights. He deserved to have his crap thrown out a window into the town square this is just downright emotionally abusive.

Tippacanoe and Taylor too: This episode is the first glimpse we see of Dean and Rory really trying to make it work after the deed. Deans brooding harder than teen Jess and Rory doesnt want to bring it up but its the giant elephant in the room preventing them from showing any more affection without being racked with guilt and shame. I think the scene where theyre embarrassingly trying to make out in the car is where Dean FINALLY hits rock bottom. He later tries to pick himself up and unconvincingly says he woulda left Lindsey anyways. In which case, they should have demonstrated some self control and just waited.

The Partys Over: in the episodes before this, we see Rory and Dean make it work in a just fine sort of way. Before this episode, Luke picks up on the subtle abusive personality cues Dean exhibits. Theyre relationship exists, but its obvious its wrong and not just because of its origin. ANYWAYS: theres a direct comparison made between Logan and Dean reading Rorys article. Dean can only say he enjoyed it while Logan actually critiques it and they have a full conversation - something I dont think weve witnessed from Dean all season.

Once again, Dean sees Rory with other dudes and over reacts. I mean obviously it doesnt look good when your gf stumbles out of a party with a small male horde but as exhibited too many times to count, he has a tendency to go mad with jealousy. He literally sees another guy near her and immediately breaks up with her...which is definitely for the best.

I'm glad Rory FINALLY moved on from Dean permanantly he started as perfect but his charm faded and by the end he couldn't keep up with her intellectually which is important for someone like Rory - in fact he didn't give a lot of effort to keep up with her the third go round. I'm glad he was able to pick himself up and move on and away and live what seems to be a full life. ",11,9,False,self,,,,,

I always thought Dean was Rorys Luke. Theyre both similar. I know people hate Dean and love Luke, so no one shoot me. Im not a dean fan and i like Luke... but they both have that explosive temper, theyre the safe consistent choice, theyre both pining for Gilmore Girls, etc 

I think Jess is like Chris. Sporadic, selfish, cant commit.. and when he changes, its just too late and the timing is never right. The maybe in a different life choice. 

I dont think Logan is like anyone in Lorelais life bc hes the complete opposite of the kind of guy Lor is into. Rory is a very different person than Lorelai and needs different things from her SO.

I saw it like Logan was representing Lorelai and Rory was representing Luke.  Logan a.k.a. Lorelai was giving the ultimatum and Rory a.k.a. Luke turned it down. Yet after Rory turned down the ultimatum, Lorelai said she made the right decision and that when someone will be right for her she will not hesitate.

In this same episode (3.19) she sabotages Lukes date at the inn out of subconcious jealousy, literallybarging in to their room telling them to get off the bed and whatnot. All while she is still dating that fishing guy!!

Lorelai is such an exhausting character to follow (and it has only been 3 seasons), her love interests change with the wind and the mini monologues of nonsensical train of thoughts have also become so.. childish.

I was watching it this morning and now that I'm a lot older and have been in a relationship for a little bit, the writing just seems so silly.

A few months ago I was watching Gilmore Girls in the living room on a laptop, head phones in. My dad walked by and must have looked at me for a few minutes without me noticing. He then started talking to my mom: ""Michelle, look at her. I guarantee she is watching Gilmore Girls. She has a smile on her face and it doesn't go away; then she'll laugh. How can she laugh so honestly with a show she has seen so many times?"" Her response was just ""I know, I've noticed too"". They didn't think I could hear them but I did. I took my headphones out, slightly embarrassed, and he just goes ""you really do love this show don't you?"" ""Yes, Dad...I truly do"". He then just kissed me on the forehead and we all went back to what we were doing. It was a sweet moment, especially since my Dad really dislikes the show and usually just 'yells' at me about it...

I'm not sure why I woke up thinking about that random moment this morning but I did and it got me thinking. A lot of people (including myself) use the line *""Its a lifestyle. Its a religion""* when trying to get others to watch or just as a general response when people ask. I just realized that, for me personally, that line couldn't be more true.

I have watched this show since it originally aired and on an almost constant loop ever since. I think about it everyday, but not exactly on purpose. At least once or twice a day someone will say something and it will trigger a moment from the show. Just last night I randomly flicked my boyfriend and he goes ""heeeey there, what the heck?"" and I just laughed. I guess my laugh was different than normal because he just gave me this look and goes ""there is absolutely NO WAY that could have reminded of you of it, seriously?!?!"" I then had to tell him that 'Hay There' was the name of Kirk's skin care product and I only thought about it because the way he said ""heyyy there"".

Until August I never really used social media so I never really knew how many other ""die hard"" fans there were out there -- it's pretty awesome. I feel like I have found ""my people"". I have always watched the show alone and never really got the chance to talk about it in depth. I also really never thought too terribly hard about it either;  I just enjoy watching it...continuity errors and all. It's kinda fun to debate and read other's thoughts on things that I may never even noticed/thought of.

Every small part, down to the town troubadour, makes Stars Hollow what it is and even if I dislike a character and/or their story line, I can appreciate them for what they are. The show is so uplifting, funny and really just all around amazing. My family &amp; I have had a pretty rough go of it the past 10 years, &amp; in a world (that I feel) has continued to go downhill, I can smile knowing that no matter what my mood or how bad life gets, I have a small quirky town to visit even if it's just for a little while.

I'm not a big reddit poster so, of course, one of the few times I am posting is going to be self-serving. My friend and I are big Gilmore Girls fans and we've started a podcast (I know what you're thinking: the world ABSOLUTELY needs more podcasts. There just aren't enough. Especially from a guy who rarely posts on reddit and has never posted on this sub).

I really think it's worth a listen. It's different from a podcast like Gilmore Guys (which, admittedly, I haven't listened to) in as much as each episode will act as a commentary track. We're going to go through the entire series with, hopefully, some pretty good insights.

Like any first episode of a podcast, we have some rough spots (especially when it comes to sound quality, how often we say ""like,"" and getting into it at the beginning) but I truly think it's pretty good (and we've already worked on fixing those issues for episode 2)! And I think it'll get better. Each episode will go up on Fridays and we eat dinner during the episode, hence the title (you can eat dinner with us!).

But in the revival... I'm sorry, she wasn't that good. I largely blame the terrible dialogue, plot, scenery, lighting, set design. Everything was working against her. But her acting wasn't as good as it used to be. The fast-paced dialogue, which used to always feel very natural and as though it had really just occured to her, felt studied. Whatever she did to her face (some call it ageing, some call it botox) also didn't help.

After Lorelai angrily confronts Dean and discovers the real reason behind her daughter's break-up, she is left to worry that she has taught Rory to fear commitment.
