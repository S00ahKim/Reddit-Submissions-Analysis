Yeah, she had the grades and the school, but what else? That alone isnt enough.

Her extracurriculars were subpar- just one year of student government and then volunteering (but not for anything related to her major). Unless anyone can think of anything else?

The show doesnt mention standardised testing at all besides the PSAT- she did well on that so I assume she would have done well on the SAT, but theres no mention of her actually taking it (and probably stressing about it) that I can remember.

She probably had decent letters of recommendation, but it didnt show her actually having a relationship with any teacher besides maybe Max.

Where is her interview? She went to talk with the alumnus, but that wasnt actually a Harvard-sanctioned interview, so it should have just been another letter or recommendation, which doesnt seem to count for much.

Its one of my favorite episodes: Rory and Paris awkwardly letting loose and of course Luke in jail. Love it.

Anyhow: I just realized that Rorys love interest, the cute guy who liked Rory and Paris kiss, looks just like a taller version of Jess. And I mean strikingly so. Especially from the side. I cant believe I havent noticed this before.

Now this made me think: Rory seems to have a type (counting in Dean as well) - dark haired and more of a bony/manly face. Also Jess and Dean seem more introverted than excessively outgoing.
And then she falls in love with Logan, a blond, round faced short guy, who is very outgoing. Of course I understand that he is well educated and supposedly reads a lot, even though I cant recall a scene where he reads a book (when would he have the time?). Not like Jess for example, he reads all the time (Dean we know, doesnt like to read).

So, next to being a rich guy in contrast to Dean and Jess, he also looks completely different. He is of course very charming, but this bothers me, that Logan does seem to be someone Rory wouldnt look for, according to seasons 1-4...

My wife was watching it many moons ago when she lost her job as a way to take her mind off. I came home from work which lead to me saying something mean, and she threw the remote at my head, subsequently killing the remote. It was a turbulent time of pregnancy hormones...

Fast forward to today. I watched scattered episodes when I would come home and they were on TV, and imagine my wife's surprise when I wanted to start watching it, after we watched the revival, and I had more questions than answers. But now I'm at S4:E16, and I have some things I love about it, and those I still hate.

-I love the spiritual consistency of the show. One way I enjoy this is that every time the Lorelais enter the Gilmore house, the mood of the entire stay in Hartford is set from the jump. To date, this has held up, but it's also commonplace in the revival as well.
-Dean's unrequited love for Rory is a nagging mess. I want to scream at him ""JUST SAY IT ALREADY!""
-I didn't care for Jess as much, but the episode with him wearing the Metallica t-shirt is priceless.
-Paris will not ever fail to be my favorite character to despise, however when she comes crying to Rory because she didn't get into Harvard gave her a much needed sense of humanity we didn't have up to that point. Plus the breakdown on C-SPAN was one of my top 30 moments. Also, how she comes back in the revival was my favorite
-I got misty when Mrs. Kim finds Lane's stash while she was on the way home from CBGB's. That tension in that moment was palpable and that's easily in the top 10 of my favorite moments.
-Sookie pregnant and being even more dangerous in the kitchen than in season one. Always good for a laugh.
-The episode A Scene In A Mall, and Love and War and Snow, two of my absolute favorite Emily Gilmore moments of all. Her trying foods outside of her palette is always great for a laugh and a perfect facial reaction.
-When Emily reads Gran's letter from the night before her wedding while going through the estate, that's so harsh that her escalation in voice is wonderful.
-The seriously bonkers amount of take out. It's one of the most boggling of plot devices ever.
-The episode where Richard and Rory go to the club. It's delightful.
-By far the least favorite moment is the end of the revival. Y'all who know, know.

I know that it's a heavily agreed upon thing that Anna doesn't handle the situation well, but I think especially when compared to Anna, Lorelai handles this very well. 

Interestingly enough my initial impression was that Lorelai could have handled it better, because she was totally acting possessive and weird (although may have had to do with Sherry's comments about not having to know each other), until these parallels/comparisons occurred to me.

Lane is freaking out about the marriage jug that her mother had instructed her to mail to Dave in CA.  She -admirably calmly and respectfully - tries to explain to her mom that while she cares about Dave, shes not interested in marriage just yet. Her mom hilariously reveals that it had never been a marriage jug but just some random jug that had been sitting around the shop for years. The story that Mrs. Kim told young Lane is that it was a special jug that she would give to the man she would marry, but it turns out that she had only told Lane that to make her stop crying. You were always crying...gave me a headache. The way the writers and actors give the situation so much buildup and then have it ripped away so suddenly is incredibly jarring, which adds to the comedy of the moment. 

And yet, a really sweet moment slipped in when Mrs. Kim made the offer of actually making it a marriage jug because she saw how much it was mattering to Lane - the actress face actually subtly softens for a minute as she says this.

Even then he was STILL all pouty and just shut down, rather than communicating his feelings. He would smother her with love and attention, even when she made it clear she wanted some alone time. Like when he called her around 14 times in the span a few hours, when she was working on a school project. And that isnt even the beginning of his problems. When he started a fight with Tristan at the school dance, I felt like he did it to establish territory over Rory, not to protect her.

Jason and Richard agree to partner up because they both loath Jasons father. While they are partners you don't really see any bad blood between them, just Emily getting upset because of Jason introducing Richard to new ways of doing things and is upset about losing tradition.  


Jasons dad says he is suing them because of a lunch Jason had with a client. Jason says it was just social. At this point we don't see Jason having done anything wrong, hes only shown to be completely loyal to Richard so we have no reason to believe he was doing anything shady. Jasons dad also drops the relationship bombshell (im surprised they kept it secret for 5 months).  


So then Jason tells Richard that this is completely unfounded and they should counter sue. Which I agree they should. Then Richard goes behind his back and rejoins the company he hates. He completely betrays someone that was loyal to him. Now one thing about Richard is hes a very honorable man who bases his respect on how honorable other people are. This just seems totally out of character for him, and we are just supposed to write it off as ""well its just business"".   


Even if we use the mindset of ""its just business"", in the business sense it makes NO SENSE. Richard is leaving a loyal partner in the dust to rejoin the company he hates ran by the man who has JUST SHOWN he has no moral compass and will lie to tie them up in litigation. And if it was really just ""a social lunch"" it would be thrown out in court pretty damn fast. If Jasons dad was like I saw you with 5 different clients having lunch and Jason said ""it was just social"". I could see the issue but all Jasons dad says is ONE LUNCH. Look at this picture my PD took of two men eating food obviously this is a breach of contract.  


The only explanation I can think of is that Richard is hurt by the fact that Lore lied to him about the relationship and questioning what else Jason has kept from him decides to do something impulsive. But even that seems like a stretch.  


Now moving on to lore, she begs her dad not to do this. And hes like nope im going to do it. Lore is upset she cant change his mind then BAM shes suddenly in family mode. Jason goes hey your dad is going to completely destroy my life so I have to sue him. Lore-you cant sue my dad. I dont want to sue him but i dont see any other option do you have any ideas of what I could do? Lore-nope, but you can't sue him because hes my dad.  


So then they break up, Lore is suddenly on the side of her dads because shes too busy tied up in the new plot point of her parents not living together.  


Just seems like Jason was just kind of written off the show real fast. Maybe it was intentional. But if it wasn't, I just felt like suddenly they were new characters and then after Jasons gone they go back to being the way they were before.

So then they break up, Lore is suddenly on the side of her dads because shes too busy tied up in the new plot point of her parents not living together to really bring it up ever again.

So I got the urge to google the meaning behind Dirty bathroom dreams like the ones Lorelai had been having for several nights and Rory implies shortly after that its been recurring for awhile.

A dream about a dirty toilet indicates toxic thoughts, emotions, beliefs, judgments or relationships. To see a dirty bathroom, full or even back-flooded toilets implies that one needs to try to sort out problems in life. 

https://www.auntyflo.com/dream-dictionary/dirty-toilet

Other interpretations involve problems with communication and solve problems aka not being able to remove waste in ones life and MOVE ON. 

This is pretty clever considering the fact that Lorelai is basically facing a mid-life crisis. Shes about to hit a big birthday and has hit dead ends with her relationship and with her business. Her daughter is moved out and on and shes not allowed to really be a part of Aprils. Her father has passed ( God rest his soul) and shes not one speaking terms with her mom. So basically her life is a mess and shes refusing to deal with it AKA flush the toilets.

TRIGGER WARNING: I talk about stillbirths and losing a child in this post. 

I feel like Sookie and Jacksons third child was never brought up because maybe they had a complication with the pregnancy and she had a stillbirth. It could explain her sudden snap and need for being away from the 4 walls of the kitchen. Perhaps she had been dealing with the loss of the third child and it keep bugging and bugging her everyday she was at work and therefore she decided she needed a break from reality for a while. An escape from her thoughts. So she turned to Nature and being outdoors as a way to finally cope with everything. We already know she was in bed rest for the second pregnancy, which puts her at a higher risk for this last one.  

The only reason why I thought of this theory is because I went through something similar. I was pregnant and there was a complication and I lost my daughter. After a few years of suppressing the pain, I snapped and had to quit my job I had grown to hate in order to heal the wound I ignored for so long.

Apart from Rachel, who to my joy actually befriended Lorelai instead of getting pitted against her, I always felt as if I was suppose to dislike every single women that was interested in/in a relationship with the same men the Gilmore's had their eyes on. And this despite the fact that those girls didn't really do much wrong. 

Sherry, for example, was extremely annoying and controlling and the fact that she wanted to act like Rory's stepmom so badly would have bugged me as well, had I been in Lorelai's shoes. BUT this was mostly a result of Chris pretending that he was a much better father than he actually is and Sherry wanting to be part of his supposedly close relationship to his daughter. And the fact that ASP tried to portray Sherry as the bad guy after Chris slept with Lorelai whilst still officially being in a relationship with her was more than hypocritical. After all she was the one who got cheated on without her knowledge. 

The next rival that comes to mind is Shane, who's only crime was to be an attractive, sexually active young woman that dated Jess AFTER Rory decided that she'd rather stay with Dean. Watching Rory badmouth Shane for the fact that she made out with HER OWN boyfriend in public and constantly talk about Shane's lack of intelligence despite not even knowing her seriously pissed me off. 

And what about Lindsey, Dean's freaking wife, who we were suppose to dislike for being a housewife/holding Dean back, despite the fact that HE decided to marry her? Weirdly enough Rory also stopped being concerned about Dean's academic future the moment he ended his relationship with Lindsey and got with her again. 

The next example that comes to mind is Nicole, who was often portrayed as being bitchy towards Luke and unreasonably jealous in regards to Lorelai. But let's be honest here for a moment: No woman would be fine with her husband having a friendship as intense and flirty as Luke has to Lorelai. The fact that their relationship ended with Nicole cheating out of nowhere is another issue I didn't particularly enjoy.

&gt; I always wanted [the story] to end in a Life Repeats Itself kind of way. The daughter following in the mothers footsteps. I always thought that was an interesting way to go, with these women who are so tied to each other and who make slightly different choices, but find themselves in interesting situations together. Because they are not like any normal mother and daughter. 

A lot of people I think were surprised by this element in the AYITL finale, but it's present throughout the whole OS.  I made a small [graphic](https://i.imgur.com/36qEIfd.png) that shows how I believe it worked for each season finale.

For example, in the Season 1 finale Lorelai struggles over whether to commit to Max, but Rory admits her feelings to Dean.

In Season 2, Lorelai commits to Christopher (though he leaves her for Sherry), and Rory wavers in her relationship with Dean by kissing Jess.

So you can see the pattern where Lorelai and Rory are making opposite choices in similar situations, but life often throws one of them a ""curveball"" that actually gives them the same outcome, ironically.

So for example Christopher breaking up with Lorelai at the end of Season 2 actually makes her life outcome parallel to Rory's (both then have relationship turmoil).

It's part of the central question for ASP: is life determined by our choices or by cosmic chance?  She seems to provide evidence for both sides, and the fact that Lorelai and Rory are so close gives her the perfect chance to explore it.",31,60,False,self,,,,,

&gt;Look, I know the reasons for wanting to end the pregnancy are so... selfish. That Im not ready. That this wasnt the plan. That I have worked so hard - every second - so that my life would be different from my mother's. I was an accident. And I know my mom loves me, but I also know, in some ways, I derailed her life. I dont want my kid to feel like that. Ever. 

It reminded of that precious Rory-Emily scene at the kitchen in ""Christopher Returns"" (1x15) after Chris' parents make it clear they want nothing to do with her. It's such an interesting moment because it's one of the few times where we see Rory feeling unloved and unwanted, and it's so heartwarming to see Emily reassures her existence isn't a mistake. It also touches an aspect of Rory's psyche that I wish had been tapped into more: the immense pressure she feels to be perfect to overcompensate for the circumstances of her birth. We see that with her academic achievements and her love life - more specifically, being so wishy-washy in regards to the whole Dean/Jess debacle. Dean was her mother's approved choice and was very much in love with her, and she. just. can't. dump. him. No matter how much she wants Jess, who's the more troubled, controversial option, she just can't bring herself to be the ""bad guy"" and ends up causing a lot pain for herself and other people as a result. Another key trait of Rory's: she tends to flounder on her own. Years of being surrounded by doting adults and a mother with she's developed a co-dependent relationship with has instilled in her a strong need for external validation... which is symptomatic of her deep-seated fear of abandonment and that the love she's often showered with - by Lorelai, her grandparents, the town - is contingent to her degree of success at being ""great white hope of the Gilmore clan"".

In season 5 the guy doesn't just call Lorelai the moment he is alone with his own child, he also admits that he never supported Sherry when it comes to taking care of GiGi and that this is most likely why she left. The man is that ignorant of his own child'd needs that he can't even change a diaper despite being a father for over a year at this point. And then he proceeds to tell Lorelai that he ""can't do this"" cause he's not as ""strong as Lorelai"" despite HAVING A FREAKING NANNY. Yes, that really sounds like the father of the year.

In season 6 he asks Lorelai to sit Gigi and we find out that she is now doing little else apart from screaming and destroying things, cause her dad really dislikes the word ""no"". Grade A parenting. What he tells us, is that he can't set rules for Gigi because she already lost her mother, which sounds lovely in theory. But what kind of useless father would watch his child behave the way Gigi does without considering that this is going to negatively impact her future if it continues?

Then in season 7 he wants to send a four year old child on a trip alone to Paris to meet a woman that is a complete stranger at this point and only changes his stance because Lorelai gets pissed. But instead of using his time in Paris to actually be around Gigi and make sure that she and Sherry really get along long-term he rather spends a romantic weekend with his girlfriend and harasses her into marrying him. And after moving into Lorelai's house he pretty much tells Gig that this is her new (part-time) home now and that Lorelai is in her life for good, despite the fact that he and Lorelai dated for less than half a year at this point. I mean the whole Lorelai/Chris thing sucked but at least all parties involved were adults (including Rory). If you have a four year old daughter that potentially gets used to your new ""wife"" and her home, however, shouldn't you act a little more grown-up?

The two final scenes with Richard, after he discovers that everything Lorelai told them about the Huntzbergers was true were very moving. 

When hes talking with Mitchum and realises, he demonstrates the closeness in his relationship with Rory which is one of my favourite things about the series. And he really does feel a sense of huge loss to know that Rory was crushed by this when he knows that shes capable of so much (especially shown in earlier scenes in the episode). 

This is then magnified as Rory comes out to do the thank yous for the event, and Edward Hermanns acting in this scene is outstanding- you can see the tears in his eyes as he knows that Rory is excelling but still not living up to his potential.

I hate when people say this when they really only mean ""I want your praise"". Feedback can go either way. 

I actually thought Mitchum handled this very nicely and humbly. He said ""guts can be wrong, and mine's been wrong before"", signifying that his opinion is not the end all be all. He explains why he feels the way he does, and gives specific examples (she doesn't have the drive, it's not good enough to just do what's asked of you). He calls her smart and competent, and apologizes for disappointing her. 

Instead of thanking him or saying that she would take it into consideration, she pouts, says something like ""oh"", and leaves. 

Everyone who hears about it calls Mitchum a jerk, a bully, etc., But to me he sounds like a normal boss giving a performance review, which is a normal practice that almost all bosses do. 

I actually found it quite endearing. It gave me the impression that he wanted Rory to succeed. He could have just said nothing, but he knew that unlike his son, she had genuine journalistic aspirations and needed guidance and direction. Maybe he felt that his speech would light a fire under her and turn her into more of a go-getter. The fact that she fell apart and stole a boat was evidence that he was right, and she was not ready for the real world. 

I would have loved if the show addressed her learning and growing from this criticism, instead of her developing a superior attitude and completely ignoring Mitchum's advice. It would have been a great opportunity to show personal growth by having her realize that she needed to develop the traits needed to follow her dream job.

I think that this whole situation is an example of romanticizing something that you actually have no idea about. Rory likely wanted to be a journalist because she liked to read, not because she was adventurous or liked getting her hands dirty. She romanticizes the idea of becoming a journalist, but we never actually see her as a kind of person in the show that digs for the inside scoop, is social enough to ask the right questions, or wants to go above and beyond with interacting with others for a story. 

(If I remember correctly, a few seasons before, Jess, the only person on the show who was ever able to really challenge her, was surprised that she wanted to be an 'in the trenches' type of journalist and said he didn't see her doing that kind of thing) 

Mitchum seems like not that great of a Dad sometimes, but he does seem like a good boss. Through the internship episode, we see him be personable and give guidance to the staff. He gets comfortable with them And gives them tips to improve. This is a big deal as the newspaper is a tiny, newly acquired one, and Mitchum is framed to be the Steve Jobs of newspaper. As a matter of fact, please let me switch bosses. I would love to work for Mitchum (AT least based on the one episode, even how he treated Rory). We also never see him be rude about Rory and Logan's relationship, he never interferes like Logan's mom and grandfather, and we never get evidence that he actually agrees with their snobbery. 

In other words I feel like we hate Mitchum because we are told to hate Mitchum. Based on his actions that we can see in the show, I don't actually think mitcham is a bad guy. He likes his work, despite being a rich guy he's down to earth, he wants his son to succeed (sometimes he is a bit forcible with that, but his son is a flake) and he cares about the ""little guy"". 

The show has taught me an important life lesson, which is that I need to be more open to constructive criticism and not view it as an attack.",63,251,False,self,,,,,

Many say Logan and Rory love each other so much that they cant let go even up till the revival. Shows how enduring their love is etc etc 

BUT no, I disagree

I dont think Rory and Logan actually love each other or have the kind of love that would last. 

Reason being, with Logan, everything is an escape. The life and death brigade was an escape, going off and stealing a boat was an escape, bringing Rory away on spontaneous trips was an escape. Appearing on The rooftop for a night all the way from London just for dinner when she misses him provides her with an escape (from how terrible she was feeling). Asking her to marry him and move to the other side of the country was also him seeking for another escape. 
The affair Rory has with him in the revival: E S C A P E

And finally calling her Ace, when everyone else calls her Rory. When theyre together shes not Rory, shes ace. Shes always in a state of escape when shes Ace. 

Now, meanwhile with Jess, sure there was always uncertainty. Rory and jess shared many interests and were similar, they loved reading and writing and the list goes on. Its a shame he was an angry teenager, but who can blame him, his life wasnt easy. But he always believed in providing for himself. He may have not treated Rory right at the point in time, but deep down Jess is the only one who really knows what Rory needs. He steers her back into the right path when shes lost. Its because of him she went back to Yale and its because of him she started writing Gilmore girls  when she easy struggling with her journalistic career.

And with Dean, it was just so genuine and pure. Dean is and always has been more emotionally mature than Rory and he didnt deserve what she did to him. But Im glad Rory had the self respect to admit that Dean always treated her right. She took him for granted because he taught her what safe was. With Dean, its always safe.  

But one thing Rory mentioned to Dean in the revival hit me. 

She says ""That as much as I wish we'd met when I was older and more mature, I know that if I hadn't had you with me when I did, I wouldn't be the person I am today

I realised that its true, if she met Dean later in life,  they probably would have worked. At least worked best out of the three boyfriends. 

Or maybe even Jess. But Logan? Not so much",29,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm going to pick movies no matter how small the reference, let's hit em all! (I've linked everything at the bottom)  


First up: West Side Story! 

  
This reference is from Episode 1, Season 1, ""Pilot""   
The scene is Lorelai bugging Luke for coffee at the diner:  
 

\[Lorelai picks up another coffee cup and goes back to the counter. Luke gives her a look.\]

**Lorelai**: What? Its not for me. Its for Rory, I swear.

**Luke**: Youre shameless.  
\[Behind Lorelai, Joey approaches Rorys table.\]

**Lorelai**: Look, Officer Krupke. Shes right at that table, right over there.  


The reference: Officer Krupke was the beat cop in both the play and the movie versions of *West Side Story*.  


I'll post on 8/9 so we can discuss! This should give everyone a chance to watch the film. :)  
(This movie is free with Amazon Prime video, if you have it!)

Here's a [quote](http://michellewittebooks.com/2015/09/elements-of-magical-realism/) on magical realism:

&gt; Time does not always march forward in the magical realist world view. The distant past is present in every moment, and the future has already happened. Great shifts in the narratives time sequence reflect a reality that is almost outside of time. This accounts for ghosts, for premonitions, and the feeling that time is a great repetition rather than a progression.

There's this almost mystical relationship between Lorelai and Rory, as well as in their relationships to their romantic partners.

These are all threads within the last week. I just watched the whole series for the first time over the past few months and loved it, and was excited to finally be able to come and discuss the show. I've participated in other cult series fandoms like buffy but I've never seen such widespread negativity regarding characters on the show! 

Don't get me wrong, Rory and Lorelai made decisions at points in the show which I didn't agree with, but I never found myself hating them. They're flawed people for sure, but they had plenty of kind moments too: and there's no better mother daughter relationship on TV. The way some people talk about the two main characters on the show it makes me wonder if I'm crazy: the show is about them and I can't imagine having enjoyed it so much if I hated them. 

Of course no show is perfect and we're not all going to love every character on the show. For me, I wasn't a fan of Dean. But still, I'm surprised to see so much discussion centered on negativity.
