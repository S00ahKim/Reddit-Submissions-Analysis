I feel for Logan, just as much as Jess, for his family troubles. Yet, the fact that he 'cheated' seems unforgivable. Knowing he's spoiled and had selfish parents who couldn't raise him, and especially knowing he always wanted to better himself, and did (!)(he turned out to be a fine young adult who got responsible), I give him a pass a lot. 

Since Rory and Logan had a great relationship because they challenged and supported each other and helped each other to be the best version of themselves they could be, I am a Logan-fan. 

We never saw a healthy relationship between Rory and Jess and he was such a jerk when they were together.

I know these discussions have been had a thousand times, but I'm in my second viewing of the show, and this time, since I'm not so wrapped up in the plotlines on the show, I'm thinking more about Rory's boyfriends--especially Jess and Dean--and coming to my own conclusions. All of this has probably been said before, and I've read some posts on this board as well that have helped me formulate my thoughts. 

Hands down, I think Jess was the best boyfriend. Or the best-suited for Rory. I didn't like him at ALL my first viewing; I was still super-focused on Dean, because I liked him so much. And as for Dean, I always thought they handled Rory's relationship with him in a very realistic way, especially in the first two seasons. Yes, the first season had a lot of Dean-centric episodes, but I like that how, after their relationship was established, they backed off of that for awhile, and it was just a given that they were together. 

I really liked Dean at first, until he got jealous and then (ugh) married, and completely gave up on all of this aspirations. Although I'm not to that point in the re-watch yet, I still vividly remember what they did to his character in the fifth season, and I hated that. He had SO MUCH potential (kind of like Lane; the writers did her a terrible disservice), and all of it was wasted. 

That might be most realistic, but I like to see characters succeed. Dean, unfortunately, did not go out on a high note. In the revival, I hope they show him in a good place, maybe finally able to be platonic friends with Rory. In closing, I came to be indifferent to him--not disliking, but not caring. 

Now, Jess: in my first watch, I remember being SO frustrated with the things he did, and said, and the way he acted. Never was there a more uncommunicative character. I realize watching back the second time, though, that he is a kid. A kid. Seventeen, and immature, entirely self-centered, and prideful. Yet he had attributes to, the balance everything out: he was obviously a hard worker, he was smart despite his utter aversion to school, and I think he really did care about Rory. I just don't think they knew each other at the right time in their lives, but he matured a lot even in season four, and ESPECIALLY when we see him again later. I think they'd be perfect together later in life, and so I'm hoping the show goes that direction with the revival, if they choose to include the boyfriends--which they probably will. I don't see how it would make sense to introduce somebody new and still try to bring back the others. 

Last, of course, is Logan. And last I think he is. I don't know--I'm still not to him in the rewatch, but my impression of him is still horrible. I know people say that he and Rory are the most well-matched, but I disagree. For about four seasons, she was sweet, and kind, and maybe a little neurotic, but still a very positive person. I feel like that went away with him, and that he ended up being a very horrible influence on her. 

I just didn't like his character--the way he spoke, the things he did, the way he lived his life; he's entitled. And I can't say much for his character arc because I gave up on the seventh season. I just felt like it wasn't Amy Palladino's characters at ALL. That's just me, though! 

Moreover, I find that I just. don't. care. I never wanted any scenes with Rory and Logan together. I didn't care about their relationship. But with Rory and Dean, I cared. Rory and Jess, I cared. Rory and Logan? Never. 

Okay, that ends my rant! I hope you don't mind this long post. Feel free to rebut what I've said; I'd love to hear your thoughts! ",31,17,False,self,,,,,

Second, this entire thing has spoilers for seasons 3 onward, so if you're not that far, please retreat while you still have a chance.      


There's been a lot of discussion, both on the Gilmore Guys podcast, and occasionally on here, about how virtually all of the main younger female cast members are ""punished"" after losing their virginity. 

 - In season 3, Paris sleeps with Jamie, and then finds out almost immediately after that she wasn't accepted into Harvard. She melts down publicly on C-SPAN, and makes the correlation that Rory was accepted when she wasn't because she's a virgin.   

 - In the finale of Season 4, Rory loses her virginity to Dean, who's married to Lindsay. We then see his marriage unravel, as well as his relationship with Rory, and her relationship with Lorelai.  

 - Probably the greatest offender, in Season 7, Lane has sex with Zack at long last on their honeymoon, and we're told that it's horrible to the point where she genuinely believes all women worldwide are conspiring together to perpetuate the belief that sex is enjoyable when it isn't. _

 - As far as verbal examples go, there's Lorelai's comment that Rory is ""the good kid"" for not losing her virginity yet, and being truthful with her. Mrs. Kim makes remarks about how Lane'll essentially have to suffer through sex on her wedding night. There's also the weird dinner conversation with Rory and the pastor Emily and Richard invite, about how she only has ""one gift"" to give, and how she'll have to give any future suitors a sweater. 

So, I suppose I'm curious on whether or not most of the people on here believe that those are all just coincidence, or that the writers intended to portray younger female characters virginities as something messy and near impossible to lose in an emotionally healthy way, or something else altogether. Sorry if this post comes off as bonkers, I just always thought that those plotlines came off bizarrely sex negative, and I'm interested to know how other people feel toward them. :)",30,32,False,self,,,,,

Sookie- God damn it, she's just adorable.

Let's do a little of fan-fiction, shall we?
I like to imagine that she could be writing about rock to a huge magazine or even her own blog or youtube channel, teaching about classic rock, or whatever. She should be living in New York or LA, with the band, doing tours around the country, I though it was so unfair that only got the chance to go out and be great, and she, Brian and Gil were left behind after all the band went through together. And Gil is a way better guitar player than Zack, but that's just my personal input.
What do you think should have been Lane's future?",17,33,False,self,,,,,
