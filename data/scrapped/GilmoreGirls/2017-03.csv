I recently watched AYITL again to get some details for my fanfic and while seeing Dean and Rory's scene, something caught my attention and sparked what I assume to be possible clue as to how ASP feels about Jess and Rory, despite being just a personal theory without any substantiation. Forgive me if the post seems too long.

First of all, I would like to say that I don't have the intention to raise any debate about Rory's boyfriend's preference, because I believe this is a very personal opinion and an extremely outworn subject.

**My impressions of the Fall scene:** ASP tried to force a conversation between Dean and Rory to reinforce the impression that Dean was Rory's best boyfriend (her opinion, not mine), that Rory didn't have the maturity to treat him right then and she admits that by saying she will speak very well of him in the book.

Then, this made me look back over season 3 with another perception.

**In season 3:** Before Rory started the affair with Dean, right after Jess left, Rory was visibly jealous of seeing him marrying Lindsey, in a clear allusion she believes it was the wrong choice to break up with Dean for Jess.

**Now here is an excerpt from a recent interview with Amy about Rory's exes.**

&gt;Sometimes I wish that the Dean and Jess thing weren't so prominent because in the grand scheme of Rorys life, who her boyfriend was when she was 16 years old is such a small event. I dont begrudge people the excitement of Jess and Dean. But they were there to show Rory's evolution as a character. She picked certain boys for her depending on who she was at that moment. It was part of her character. It was part of her development that Dean was her first boyfriend, that Jess was the boy that diverted her attention.

**And this is the other key one** 

&gt;As Sherman-Palladino pointed out, ""You grow up, and you push your wings out and you figure out what you are. The person who's in your life at that moment -- you'll learn from it, you'll grow from it, you'll say **'Never again' or 'Ugh, I shouldn't have let that go'.** I think she had the right boys for the right times.""

It really doesn't make sense that the statements made in these transcriptions are about Logan, since Rory didn't had a closure with him until this interview and ASP was talking about Dean and Jess, it is possible to say that the ""I shouldn't let that go"" was Dean and the ""Never again"" was Jess in her POV?



**TL;DR**
Taking this information into account, is it accurate to saiy that, by these statements and plotting decisions, ASP purposely leads to the understanding that Rory considers dating Jess a mistake and the fact she has rejected him so many times after that indicates that ASP never had the intention of making Jess the endgame, completely dismissing the theory of ""Jess is her Luke""? What do you guys think?

So why oh why does she use red, symmetrical tomatoes, with their pink and white flesh? 

She needs to find herself some ugly, green mottled red heirloom tomatoes, with gushy dark flesh and seeds. C'mon Jackson, I expected better of you in this dept.

Oh yeah this too:

I actually have a lot of qualms about Lorelei and Rory (esp Lorelei who seems to me to be the main character). I hate how Sookie and Lane are pushed aside by their respective BFFs. At least Lane gets her own subplot. Also the actress isn't bad, esp compared to Rory, but half of her acting seems to be in making sulking, pouty faces to express her distaste, confusion, bemusement, oh and I guess 90% of her emotions. Can someone say Personality Disorder? Which brings me to my next point. 

Lorelei is abhorrently self-absorbed, judgmental, and narcissistic. Nooo self-awareness For example, when Michel wins the RV and she explodes at him for ruining her photo shoot. What an asshat. Yes she apologizes and it seems sincere, but wow does she have extreme rxns (both in her anger and in her effusive apology). I think therapy is a wonderful field, and I think Lorelei could have benefited from it. And wtf was the deal w Paris transitioning from HS to college. They never make an interesting unfolding of her transformation from pedantic, overachieving high schooler to a different kind of hot mess; they just use her relationship with Asher as the catalyst for her change instead of something more complicated or interesting. 

Also, Rorythey try to make her go from  nave, nerdy tool to socialite but she just seems to be on a conveyor belt of meeting other boys to effect change, instead of a chance for us to see any sort of introspection. I think the later seasons lacked because of the dearth of Lorelei and Rory speaking more often, which ultimately lead to more insight into each of them. 

It would have been best to cut the cord after Season 4, maybe even 3.

At the end of S7 episode Introducing Lorelai Planetarium, Luke is at April's hospital bedside flicking through the channels. He stumbles upon an old film, and is clearly affected by it. I'm sure most people noticed that it reminds him of Lorelai, because the characters talk about eloping and getting married. But it's even more than that.

The film is the classic screwball comedy The Philadelphia Story (one of my all-time favourites, but I know a lot of people don't watch old films..Any other fans?!) Firstly, the line we are clearly shown is Kate Hepburn's character, Tracy, mentioning that she previously *eloped in Maryland*. Ring any bells? In the S6 finale, Lorelai tells Luke that they should elope to Maryland, and when Luke turns up in the S7 premiere he's like ""I heard you mention Maryland..."" There's no special reason for them to go to Maryland, right? But showing us the scene from the Philly Story reveals that Lorelai was inspired by the film. Luke only realises in the hospital scene as well.

I am absolutely convinced that the ""Maryland"" stuff was a deliberate choice, and the writers were giving us a big clue clue to the destiny of L&amp;L. The whole premise of The Philadelphia Story is that Tracy - who's from an aristocratic family - is getting married to George, another wealthy type who she doesn't really love. Her ex-husband Dexter - who's *not* part of the old-money clique - turns up and at the end (the scene we see in Gilmore Girls), Tracy decides to marry Dexter again instead of George. The parallels are obvious:

Tracy = Lorelai

George = Christopher

Dexter = Luke

In other words - Lorelai rushes to marry Christopher as a rebound from Luke, just as Tracy rushes to marry George. But in the film it's a mistake and of course Tracy marries her true love Dexter instead....So the clip from the film was a big hint: eventually Lorelai will go back to Luke and marry him ""as originally, and most beautifully planned."" :-D

Here's the Philadelphia Story clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-vA6GMMKgQ

Also remember that ASP said several times that she was inspired by the classic Katharine Hepburn comedies, which often include her marrying someone of a different social class. So I think she always intended this parallel, and David Rosenthal knew about it and inserted the clip.",10,60,False,spoiler,,,,,

Sure her parents weren't the best parents and should of been more understanding and supportive of her and her decisions but I don't think Emily deserved all the anger and hate she got from Lorelai. You can tell that she just wants a relationship with Rory and Lorelai and wants what's best for her (I know she does things that don't show that). I think it was unfair for her to turn Rory against her parents as much as she did regardless of her reasons. 

It kills me to see the heart ache Emily has about how things turned out between them. I am curious to know how well you all like Emily?

Boyfriend and I started dating two years ago. I quickly made it known that Gilmore Girls was my favorite show.  He then made it his business to watch every single episode of every single season, absorbing all the characters and their quirks and the inside jokes that he now uses in every day conversation.  

Fast forward to this past Saturday.  We were in the mountains of Tennessee staying in a beautiful little bed and breakfast, not unlike the Dragonfly.  We walk in the door after a day of antiquing, and the ENTIRE lobby is covered with, literally, a thousand yellow daisies.  My boyfriend is down on his knee, with a ring, dressed in a blue flannel and backwards baseball cap (a la Luke) and asked me to be his wife.

He'd been planning it for 6 months, because the first time we watched the episode where Max proposed to Lorelai, I told him, ""THIS is what a proposal should be.  This is it.""

This episode is one of several reasons why I often don't watch the post-Chilton seasons. It's just too painful, aggravating, and even confusing to watch the events transpire, and see Jess walk away. When it originally aired, I certainly didn't view it as an invitation to see Jess come back. It seemed like a definite goodbye from Rory, a moment of closure. Does anyone know if ASP had wanted to do more with Jess, but ended up having to change things along the way, aside from the spinoff series? While he is certainly one of my favorite characters (and I am most definitely #TeamJess), I feel like his development and presence on the show is incredibly uneven.

BUT earlier in the season, when Rory first confronts Logan about the phone call she had with Honor, that she had to find out they were broken up through his sister and that Logan didn't have the courage to break up with her properly, Logan's defence was that he just needed some time to think and only told Honor they were broken up to get her off his case.

Back in 2002, I saw a show on a local TV network ( They would show one episode of a random show without names and sometimes without translation) and it was about a girl and her young mom, it was bizarre since i never understood anything from this episode and it was full of strange people(i still remember Luke and I remember having a crush on him back then) so....


Years gone by, it was after the war on my country and introduction of Satellite where you could watch on certain channels many shows, one of them was this strange show about a mom and her daughter but the lady was in college now (Wasn't she in highschool when I first saw her???) and so, there was still this barrier of fast speech and jokes i didn't understand and references i couldn't begin to comprehend , but still, Luke was there and he looked the same as I remembered him &lt;3

My sister has started to watch the same show with me but due to frequent blackouts and civil war, we couldn't understand what was going on , but we knew that we liked this show .

And so, fast forward to 2017, when I accidentally stumbled upon a review about a revival of some show after it being canceled since 2007 (I never imagined it was canceled, so imagine my surprise) and then....

I went and bought a bundle of all seven seasons....

It was amazing....simply amazing...
Man, did i miss alot back then, now as I am older and matured and had watched tons of movies, shows ,read many books, I finally began to get the tremendous amount of cultural references and actually laughing at it, the show was a masterpiece, the characters, Lorellie , Luke(heart melting) , Rory, Sookie,Dean, Jess ,Paris, Lane, and many many others, Its been the best month in my life.

I cried like a baby when I saw the revival, I cried and laughed throughout watching this show , i watch it even when I am washing the dishes (On my cell) and before I sleep, Luke oh sweet, grumpy , reliable Luke...

Just wanted to share it with others who understand, I am glad I watched it now, as I can appreciate it much better than if i had watched it in my youth.

Just want to thank all those cast and crew who introduced us to the magical world of GG.

So I'm wondering if you all have seen it and what your thoughts are?

I think the title sounds fairly off putting (why can't ASP name a show well?), but I actually really enjoyed the pilot and I'm really hoping Amazon picks it up for more. I think the main character is incredibly endearing and unlike their ability to show us Rory's talents, it seems like Midge's are pretty clear. The things that come across as distinctly Palladino like are so subtle, and I think I like that aside from Alex Borstein, it's got a lot of distance from Gilmore Girls.

Edited to add. 10 to 12 years was pushing it but i think ive added the timeline up properly now  

""Ok i think ive added it up properly now. I think there is a 6 or 7 year age gap between them. 

My math/thinking; luke is around 33 or 34 in the 6th season and the comment gets made that his dark day started 15 years ago when his dad died, so if it was the 7th grade that kirks books got knocked out of his hands then Luke would have still been in school but kirk would have been 12 or 13 and luke would have been 18 or 19.

I hated it. I was so upset because a few friends and I made a huge breakfast and coffee and mimosas and sat down to a big bundle of disappointment. I hated the musical, how slutty Rory had become, how unrealistic Rory's life was (considering I feel more mature at 22 than she acted at 32), and that Sookie was not there until the very end. AND THOSE LAST FOUR WORDS slayed me. I thought, after all these years, we would finally get some closure and we didn't. I hated it so much I stopped watching the OS as well. Then a few weeks ago, I started to miss it and told myself I would only watch the OS and ignore the revival. But as I was watching I started to notice things like Miss Patty's dance performance night that Lorelai and Sookie went to and I began to understand. By the time I reached season 7 I was excited to watch AYITL. Suddenly I understood Amy and why she wrote it the way she did. I just watched Winter last night and loved it. I still can't quite explain why the change happened, but I think looking at the big picture, I'm able to better understand and appreciate why it was written the way it was. And while I still regret that they spent so much time on the musical when I would've loved to see more Jess time (sorry Logan and Dean fans) I kinda get it.

Did anyone ever consider that Dean proposed to Lindsay because of a pregnancy scare?

They only dated for a few months before he proposed. Also the timeframe between the proposal and wedding was short. One could say shotgun-like. He asked at the end of senior year (probably June) and they got married in the beginning of the school year (September). It all happened within 3 months! What's the rush?

Maybe after they found out it was a false alarm- Dean was scared to back out of the engagement? Dean was always sensible- before season 4 where he became a bumbling idiot. There's no way Dean would propose to a girl like Lindsay if there want a pregnancy scare involved. 

Dean is the kind of guy who would want to do the right thing. He was always a nice guy - if you ignore the whole cheating thing.

Also- am I the only one who thinks Lindsay was probably a mean girl? In season 3 she always came off kind of snotty.  She always seemed like she was probably one of those teen girls who became popular and all of a sudden became unbearable. She always gave Rory dirty looks and hardly ever spoke to her. Lindsay was the first to be hostile, way before Rory ever was. The fact that the only nice thing Rory could say about Lindsay was that she bought Rory a magnet back in the fourth grade , speaks volumes to me. 

It also drives me nuts that Luke knew Dean was still hung up on Rory and never gave the groom-to-be any advice. Especially since Luke held it against Dean in season 5. Considering Luke was going through a divorce himself, he should have shared some perspective.

This all seems to come to a head in Season 6, Episode 10 (""He's Slippin' 'Em Bread... Dig?""), when Zach finds out that Bryan has written a song for Lane, after Zach refused to write one for her, even though he's her boyfriend, and has written songs about other girls. He then decides to be an awful human being at their one chance for a studio to look at them, and openly brawls with his bandmates in one of the biggest moments of their band, just because Bryan tried to do something nice for his FRIEND.

The scene in 6x08, for instance, Jess comes back into Rory's life, sees it's not going the way he pictured it and screams that he 'knows her better than anyone; this isn't her' and honestly that felt like he was disappointed in her for not living up to the idealised version of Rory he had in his head. Like bearing in mind he didn't know all the details of why Rory had dropped out of Yale, he comes back into her life after like two years, criticises her clothes, her lifestyle choices and her boyfriend (yes I know Logan was being a total dick that night but honestly 'I pegged the guy the second I saw him.' and 'The blonde dick with a Porsche, we used to make fun of guys like that.'

After years turned to decades of supporting my families needs, I finally managed to find time for myself.  It took me about 5 years to rearrange my life and remember who I am.        
Last summer I made a big break to start a new adventure about me and what I wanted.   I had no idea that I was so tired.  Tired in mind. body and spirit.   There was no hospital stay for exhaustion or pills to make me happy.   My body needed to rebuild before I could begin again.   By some grace I happened upon Gilmore Girls on Netflix.  I was not a Gilmore watcher or a Netflix junkie; but I became one.  Over and over and over again.  Then AYITL came out and I did the OS and AYITL again and again.       
I didnt question why.  I usually don't, just try to listen to my body. So I watched and I watched.  Slowly my independent spirit came back.   I would not be lying to tell you that I watched it about 30 times straight through and immediately back to the pilot.   I wrote out timelines and character arcs.   I looked up details and watched it as much as I could every day.   hours and hours.        
I finally figured out that this show is written with a respect for women's thought process.  No one thinks they are weird for their logic.   My best example is Lorelai and Sookie talking about a big decision.  Lorelai says that it as big a decision as whether to perm or not.   Women know that logic.  We appreciate that logic.          
Gilmore Girls is what I needed.  I watched it over and over until I remembered that logic and felt pride in it again.   Thanks, I needed that.   ",9,49,False,self,,,,,

That said, going back and watching season 1 mainly, I'm so surprised at how different her character is. Obviously her main character traits are always there but the way she acts and most significantly, speaks, was so different at the beginning. I really love her lower voice and I guess overall the way she was at that point, I don't mean this in a degrading way as Rory's always great and her intelligence or whatnot are not defined by those things.

 I guess I feel like she became very upbeat in the later seasons, nothing wrong with that but it's a significant contrast to how she's originally portrayed. Also the voice change is so strange to me since usually people's voices don't tend to get more high-pitch with age, and I really loved her mellow and kind of low-pitch voice at the start. Again, that's not really a criticism, her voice doesn't make her less or anything but it does feel like watching a different character at times.",6,8,False,self,,,,,

Im on season 1 and I love how Rory is different from other teenagers in other tv series. Often times we see characters who care a lot about what their peers think and give in to peer pressure. At the Bangles concert for example, she refused to go with the girls because she knew it was wrong. 

However, I just cant stand Dean. Sorry for people who like him though! I really want to like him. Mostly, I'm irritated that no one pointed out that his reaction to Rory not saying ""I love you"" was wrong. I understand that these characters are teens and are therefore immature. However, his reaction is another level of brattiness. It was almost to the point of controlling. To me it was equivalent to giving someone a gift and then throwing a fit when not receiving a gift in return. 

Im at the episode where he freaks out again just because he saw Tristan walking with Rory holding her books.
