&amp;#x200B;

the link is for the pictures; i cannot put the pictures here

&amp;#x200B;

The notes introduce us early on to the weaknesses of every individual, in their own perspective, in their own narration. Including Jimin's parents treating him like a dead person, and Hoseok's tragic incident of abandonment.

Here, I'll write my theory assuming that you have read the notes, watched the mvs, and read some of the save me episodes, if not, please consider doing so before reading my theory.

The turning point in fact starts with butterfly. we get to see the house of cards in run falling down due to one card being picked by Taehyung; the card is of butterfly, the downfall of everything

&amp;#x200B;

It is where everything begins- Jungkook sings begin, remember? We know that butterfly is the beginning of the rising action because Jungkook's mask in the MAMA's references butterfly and the sacrifice that he made along with his pact made with Taehyung. Jungkook's weakness is where it all began- Butterfly- because it is what led to the others being in pain in fake love. This is why we see him under the ocean like tae, with the petals that he sacrificed, and those petals then transform into butterflies. In addition, it is only Taehyung and Jungkook whom have seen dreams about the incidents, thus making it ideal for them to seal a pact.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The petals or the untold truth smeraldo resemble the untold truth about the butterfly incident and the sacrifice Jungkook has made. Jungkook comes out clean by telling his own truth. As we all know, the untold truth is sung by 4 people- Jungkook, Taehyung, Jin, and Jimin and thus the four masks in here&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

The butterfly prologue is an incident that happened that made jin realise about the other's weaknesses, and that caused a major change, known as the butterfly effect.

It may have happened right before the time travel incident.

We find out at the end that Taehyung jumps from the platform, and so he is the ""butterfly"". But what if he is not- but rather, that memory of him jumping is?

In butterfly, Jin insists on filming tae- and he knows that tae is suicidal

&amp;#x200B;

Then, he tells the members 'lets go to the ocean' and where does he drive the car to? The platform where tae jumped. He indirectly leads to Taehyung's death.

We know that Jin also may have caused Jungkook's accident; the familiar sound of the car engine that Jungkook had in the notes were because it was Jin. This is why Taehyung and Jungkook made a pact. This is why we also see Taehyung holding a grudge over Jin.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only does the butterfly incident relate to Jin, Taehyung, and Jungkook, but it also relates to Jimin. This is the forest where the butterfly got lost. This is also the forest that Jimin may have been in when he was young.

&amp;#x200B;

Similar trees, indeed.

In bst, we see that Taehyung becomes a devil, having the wings of Icarus (referenced through the paintings).

The story of icarus is as follows:

Icarus wanted to fly and so, his father made him wings, but made him wings of wax and feathers, he told icarus not to go near the sun when flying, although the father himself knew that Icarus would. Because the feathers were attached using wax, the wings got distorted when Icarus flew near the sun. And so, he fell and drowned.

&amp;#x200B;

In this story, the father represents Jin and Icarus represents Taehyung. His wings were made by Jin, Jin allowed him to fly and drown. Then these events are followed with the fact that to each member his weakness. We get to see awake, lie, etc... In bst, Jin gets to see them suffer; Hoseok points at Taehyung, Jungkook drinks absinthe from Namjoon, and Yoongi hides the truth from Jimin. The truth is shown due to the butterfly incident, the weakened sides are shown. But rather, slowly.

In return to the icarus fall, Taehyung directs Jin once he forgets to the statue containing the wings, to make a deal that causes Jin to break, and Jimin's blindfolds to go off along with green tears of absinthe (alcohol). Interchangeably, Jin becomes icarus, and Taehyung becomes the father again, again going back to why the house of cards fall. All of these happen due to the butterfly incident, the truth is revealed to jin and jimin at the end, taehyung , later on jungkook in fake love.

&amp;#x200B;

Following that, we see that the highlight reels arrive, and Jin finds the red diary and his untold truth, but before he hands it to his weakened side, her, she dies. And therefore, we never see her because now, she has become a part of them. And so, Jin decides to wear a cap and start new.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jimin is always associated with blue and hoseok with red, the sin is taking the red pill; aka living in a prosperous lie; but when it comes to the blue pill, it talks about accepting reality and its painful events.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

jimin took the apple which is the sin, he keeps trying to lie and hide away from the truth, but hes in pain because he already knows the truth and is living it meanwhile hoseok decided to live happily with his hallucination pills.

*These are references from the matrix- a movie that talks about Virtual Reality; it may also imply that these are fake events*

&amp;#x200B;

Also it is possible that jimin ended up taking hoseok's pills in the hospital after hoseok left in euphoria, thats why he imagines them all.

Although spring day is not a part of the BU universe, there are a pair of shoes which are found in the sea, and later returned to a blossom tree, this dates back to the first comeback trailer of the BU series.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The guy was playing basketball, but AS he was playing basketball, we see the other him chasing to find the flower, the flower that gives him hope, and as we see, the flower's petals are gone except one

That guy is jin. All he has to do is return to the first time and first place where he hid the truth. We see a guy running, (jin himself running) and we see jin playing basketball as well. Two jins

It does not only reference the trailer, but it also references Luna's shoes in the Harry Potter series when she mentions that you always find things in unexpected places; this represents how Jin will find his way- his map of his soul- through the shoes- through going back to unexpected places.

&amp;#x200B;

During forever rain, the guy with the cap which represents Jin from highlight reel is seen to have a shadow of the six members; which may represent that they are a part of him and that he cannot let them go.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, we get to see singularity where Taehyung gets to hear a voice yet cannot hear his own, the pain in his throat is agonising and he has a mask to hide his voice. The frozen lake is made of ice layers that represent his emotions and pain, and the song is slow to represent how slow it is for ice to melt for spring to return.

&amp;#x200B;

During fake love, Jungkook's weakness is seeing the others in pain.

Taehyung gave the key to jungkook to go and join the others to go out of this loop, jungkook's weakness is the butterfly event because its where everything changed and gone different and the weaknesses of the others had gotten presented- thus why hes in a dark room in fake love

&amp;#x200B;

All tae did was return the devil wings to its owner, and in order to remove the devil wings from both himself and jin, he allowed jungkook to make a sacrifice or possibly some sort of agreement with tae by sacrificing jungkooks petals, in order to stop jin from turning back time or staying on this loop possibly, possibly, that voice that jin hears is possibly the devil, maybe tae, or another person.

Taehyung is known to be innocent up until the sudden incident where he can no longer take it, all of them are devils since we've seen Hoseok's wings in boy meets evil and they all have met evil, but jin made an agreement with tae's since jin made tae's devil wings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We also see a fight scene between jin and tae in the notes.

Possibly, in order to remove the devil wings from jin, jungkook sacrificed his flower.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, why is it that the smeraldo is pink and blue? Her is represented by pink, the blue represents the individual members separate from their weaknesses and their passions. when those two colours mix, they resemble self. As we all know, her is a reminder of their weaknesses along with their dreams; an example would be how Jimin's girl reminded him of the arboretum due to the bleeding hand but she also reminded him of dance- his passion. That is why at the end of highlight reel, we never get to see the girls, that is why we get to see that Jin has the red diary in the save me webtoon, on april 11, even before he met her in the notes, which got me chills. Mixing pink and blue makes purple- and what does purple mean? Love. So, the girls + the boys= self. Pink+ blue= purple/ love. love yourself. Taehyung already hinted this out on November 13th, my birthday .

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It is possible that there was a person who told Jimin to commit a sin in the arboretum, thus why Jimin referenced snake in his lie lyrics.

&amp;#x200B;

Theyre all connected through this: they have dreams (not literally; ambitions), they failed to follow their dreams because of fears and weaknesses, they threw away their future bytrying to commit suicide, they destroyed their reality, they gave up andstopped running, they didnt decide their path ever since their lives begun,they didnt chase the butterfly before it went deep in the forest, the butterfly is their solution, and each one of them is connected to the other as though one (e.g. rm and tae, jimin and hoseok). possibly, the butterfly is a memory that has been altered, it is a memory that gives off the butterfly effect. a memory that if changed, it changes everything, and it ran away from jin's thoughts, but throughout the end of euphoria, we see that jin finally found that memory, and as a result went back to the sea, throwing the camera away...

&amp;#x200B;

After all of this, jin decides to finally turn back time after realising the fake love he's had for himself and so he's got his epiphany and faced his sad self with the diary and it was all because of taehyung - finally as a real hero (his dream in the notes)

As for the camera, it films. but does it show your true emotions? no. but when it comes to your own eyes, you can tell that someone is sad, someone is happy, someone is being fake or not, you can see it all, no filters, and in cameras, video tapes are made, these tapes can be edited and can be changed, they are records of memories, but they can also be fake ones

And so, the camera represents the collection of memories jin has had, it also represents how jin has always seen the fake them but never got to see them as they are , truly with his own eyes, thats why we see him holding a camera all the time and thats why when jimin in lie had a camera ask him things, he would keep shrugging and acting, but without the camera, you would see his weaknesses

&amp;#x200B;

jimin doesnt keep a diary, its mentioned in the notes, yet all of their feelings etc are recorded, they may be narrations, or they may even be like the tom riddle diary, where harry goes back in time through the book and sees the events occuring but sees it in tom's pov; tom never kept a diary, the diary was created from his memory, so the diary's memories couldve been changed, the diary in THIS sense represents the camera.

&amp;#x200B;

Harry had the power of speaking snake language- Jin had the power of turning time back- Both Harry and Jin destroy a lie in the end- Harry destroys the diary which blames Hagrid instead of Tom, the culprit, Jin ensures that the truth is told in the end

We also see dumbledore saying it is important to not dwell on dreams and the mirror of erised; in bts, the mirror of erised shows the real and the fake them but they cant tell which is which, and so basically they lived dwelling on their weaknesses and their mask instead of focusing on reality

&amp;#x200B;

It says 'i show not only your true side but also your fake side'

Basically they dwelled on the mirror because they dont know whether the mirror shows the real them or the fake them and they kept on allowing their weaknesses to take over them and also they saw their true side whenever they follow their passions; aka the mirror is sorta similar to the girls and thats why the girls are the turning point of this all; they saw both sides, but they dont know which is which.

But in the end we realise, their true side is a combination of their weaknesses and their dreams but- it mostly consists of them showing the weakness and not hiding it, and also showing their dreams,without hiding the dreams.

During the MAMA performance, this is the only time we see jhope as sad; when hes loved; when hes in the red- ""room"" but in all the other backgrounds; hes smiling even tho crying but the reason why hes sad when hes loved is because he never got love from his mom.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We also get to see his weakness referenced in Jimin's room; possibly implying that the kid abused was hoseok.

&amp;#x200B;

It is always that jin is behind a window, not in front of it, and we know windows show us what is beyond, but they also show us a reflection (in jin's case, a reflection of the past) and because jin is behind the window, he cannot go beyond the window. the window is like a cage; its holding him away from moving on because hes done something wrong- and ive already told yall the jungkook and the tae incident.

&amp;#x200B;

since Jin hasn't been prone to evil, butterfly allowed Jin to see the depth of this world and the unseen. aka. wings. because of butterfly, Jin has been able to see the weaknesses and strengths of all of them. that's why we get to see awake in the end. he finally sees the true them. and so... after taehyung falls. Jin also becomes a winged person, he is introduced to the world of evil. the true world. the world he kept hiding himself from. he was the bird in the egg. and now he is flying to the god abraxas. in this sense, we can say that abraxas may have been taehyung.

and thus afterwards, jungkook gets the same realisation, and so tries to fight for their happiness through his sacrifice to taehyung; giving up the flower he had. giving up that memory, that thought, that belief that made them suffer. that belief was that life is full of innocence. youths live innocence adults live sinfully. in reality, it is both, and it is a choice. andso Jin and jungkook are given the choice to decide between whether they want to live innocently (without masks), or sinfully (with masks). kinda also references red pill blue pill of the matrix.

.

.

.

.

Now to conclude,

They either represent Jin

In a metaphorical sense, i believe that all of them are a part of jin, thats why harry potter is referenced; voldemort and harry were one person metaphorically, just, in concentric circles, voldemort is the smaller circle, harry was the bigger circle, one containing love around the smaller circle.

or

They are separate people but with similarities

or

Jin is schizophrenic

because of these:

The MAMA opening contained something similar 

The forever rain incident-

it is jin

he wants his face to be covered

and also- him walking in a dark path in rain

him seeing himself in the dark circle thing

he is losing his way

because of the rain

if u look at the path, it ends up being broken into pieces

so in forever rain, everyone is turning away from that black circle thing

but jin sees it as his white circle/ bright future

its as though he stopped time

maybe this hints out the comeback

as for why all the others disappear through the end especially the bird; the bird is symbolising the flight towards abraxas. oH AND in wings, jin was the only one who had a blank black circle thing

it symbolizes how he lost hope.

he lost hope of reaching abraxas

he lost hope of reaching out to others

thus""forever rain""

and also this is why his cap falls down

he lost hope

his path is unknown

he doesnt know his surroundings

and hes letting the dark thing swallow his life in the end

The different schools

&amp;#x200B;

Auditory hallucination references in the notes

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Awake, the props, and them being in one house in bst japanese

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

the reason why bts referenced icarus is to let us know to use our abilities, but in the right way

for example, jin was gifted time travel, just like how icarus was gifted wax feather wings

but in the process, jin thought he could be happy by saving everyone on his own, just like how icarus thought he could fly near the sun

but then afterwards, icarus drowns because the wax melted

jin would have suffered if he kept on time travelling alone without help",13,15,False,self,,,,,

To get us hyped up on all the upcoming BTS events, the Projects Team is hosting a mini-giveaway:

# What's the prize?

The winner of the raffle will get a **Map of the Soul: PERSONA Album from the Projects Team + a gift package from u/MasterOfConcrete!**

# How do I enter?

- **Leave a comment on this post talking about your favorite song off of the [album](https://imgur.com/waWawGc.jpg).** No limits - feel free to tell us what song is currently on replay for you, or about your favorite part. (Personally, HOME just summons the bodyrolls and Dionysus gives me the strength to finish this semester.)

- Since we know picking JUST ONE favorite song is difficult, you can comment as much as **7 TIMES, one for each song**! 1 comment = 1 entry. If you do multiple comments for the same song, that's only going to count as one entry.

- **Bonus Entry #1: Stream Boy With Luv**! It can be on Youtube, Spotify, or Apple Music. Include a screenshot (with your reddit username) in any of your comments to get +1 entry. 

- **Bonus Entry #2: [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rbangtan_ARMY)**! Include a screenshot (with your reddit username) in any of your comments to get +1 entry.

- **Bonus Entry #3: Recap the contents of this post** in 10 words or less. Post it in a separate comment to get +1 entry.

# Timeline

- **Entries Period** With the BBMAs and the tour starting this week, we decided to run this event for a week. So, if you'd like to participate in the raffle, you have from today **1st May to 7th May 11:59 PM US CST** to enter.

- **Raffle Draw** The winner will be drawn on 8th May (US CST), right after we consolidate and double-check the entries. We will make an announcement to contact the winner!

# PROJECT UPDATES

Alright, so you may be wondering why we were inactive during the earlier months of this year. The BTS Projects Team went through a bit of restructuring (a fancy blanket term for getting our shit in order).

## CENSUS 2018
- We're sorry for the delay, but rest assured we're still working on it! We've had over 2,000 participants for the main census (35 questions) + over 100 participants for the extended version (27 additional discussion questions), so going through all the data takes quite some time. We're aiming to present the census by June. We'll make sure to delivery quality results!
- For the newer subscribers, you can see the census results [here (2017)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8v81o5/2017_rbangtan_census_book_and_full_results/) and [here (2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/).

## Birthday Projects 2019
- You may have noticed that we haven't hosted any birthday projects for this year, the last ones being for 2018 JIN and V. We've yet to find a fitting alternative to our previous birthday books (the ""newsletter"" type we did for last few birthdays were meant as a temporary alternative). If you have any suggestions for birthday activities for the subreddit, please let us know! We're open to all ideas.

## MUSTSERVE 2019
- If you're familiar with MustServe, skip to the second bullet. For those who weren't here last year (or forgot about it), MustServe is the subreddits month-long project celebrating BTS' anniversary by doing acts of charity or service. Last year, we raised $150 USD for the Love Myself campaign, and contributed over 200 volunteer hours from all around the world! Take a look at the [2018 MustServe results here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8v8137/armymustserve_closing_post/).

- We'll be hosting the MustServe project again this year, for BTS' sixth anniversary! The Projects Team has some exciting things in store for you (do I sense yet another postcard exchange??). We'll be posting a formal announcement within the month, so stay tuned! If you have any suggestions for charity activities, leave a comment or a message for us.

## OTHER PROJECTS
- If you have any other concerns not highlighted in this post (like Christmas and Valentines exchanges), please please send us a message! We're working tirelessly to ensure that all issues have been resolved, but we want to be 100% sure.

&amp;nbsp;

We hope to see a lot of you lovelies in our notifications! Good luck!

I discovered them right before they blew up in America and before Fake Love was released last year. Their performance at the BBMA 2018 was the first time I ever seen so much Asians at a show on TV. I always felt a glass ceiling with being an Asian male. We are looked as nerds, least feared and last in sex appeal. The media industry is limited with us and we never had anyone in the music industry stand as loud as BTS. I am so thankful for all their work. They put Asian men on the map. They are the first to break the glass ceiling and I am happy for their success. I pre-ordered their records since Love Yourself: Tears to support them.

I'm proud to say I am apart of ARMY! &lt;3",35,384,False,self,,,,,

i have more but they aren't ready yet so im still checking them and to see if i missed anything. oh and pls comment down below what audios i have missed since their debut like N.O trot version which u can find in bangtan, misc vol. 1, so pls let me know audios that u know i've missed bc i haven't watched all of bts content im still a new army and ive been collecting these audios since 2017 from many different armys, but i wanted to make my own and i want it to be complete. 

I also put the credits for where and whom i got the audio from. the audios from me are all from BTS original posts in BANGTANTV, V LIVE and twitter. I hope u enjoy these bc i really love all of bangtan's singing and rapping that are caught in camera and i want to be able to listen to it while i'm riding the bus or just walking. 

I compiled them chronologically like for example volume 1 is audios from 2013-2015.

Also u can follow me on twitter @btscol\_lection where i will post updates or like changes that are made on the collection.

U can see that the album covers i made for each volume is in the style of my favorite albums of all time :))) of course credits to the things i used to make the album covers can also be found in the google drive.

Upcoming things that I will also upload:

* unreleased, predebut - 69 tracks (finished already but still editing the credits)
* bangtan commercial songs - 5 tracks (some commercial songs i included in misc. audios bc i kinda think it fit more there idk tell me what you think)
* bangtan live - 22 tracks for now
* bangtan, covers (almost finished but one album's cover art is still being edited)
* bts drafts and demos (30% finished)

that's all, feel free to tell me your opinions and suggestions :)))",9,91,False,self,,,,,

Hope you are well and taking care of yourselves!

So basically I want to talk to you guys about what you think of BTSs new album now that it's been out for almost 3 weeks. I usually take my time adjusting to new things, and BTS's music style changes so much that with every album: the sounds are always a really new and unexpected.

Going through a number of BTS comebacks now, whenever I hear the new album for the first time I feel confused, and usually (because I am slow adjusting to change) I feel taken aback and misinterpret my shock to a new thing as dislike. I have founxvthat after I've listened to their album a couple more times and make a judgment myself, I get oriented really well and I am never disappointed.

I guess I never know what to expect with BTS, their next sound is extremely unpredictable, but for some reason their success isn't hahahahha

Anyway, this time I am shocked because I LOVE this album and EVERY SONG in it!! In every other previous album there has always been a song I can never get into, but this album OMG WOW!
I think what made it even better for me was i recently watched DKDKTV's 'first listen' livestream where they explain the lyrics and I lost my mind, BTS is too pure for me to handle.

So yeah, I just wanted your opinions on this Album now that it's been out for a while, and I was also curious to know how you guys usually adapt to a new album

The article is heavy on attention and praise for BTS and Halsey. Some excerpts below:

But [Taylor Swift](https://variety.com/t/taylor-swift/) was making her return to performing on awards shows after a couple of years of laying off em, and between having her, Grande, [Halsey](https://variety.com/t/halsey/) and [BTS](https://variety.com/t/bts/)  on board, it didnt feel like sitting through hours worth of  second-tierers  at least not for a show thats upfront about ignoring  juries of peers in favor of celebrating pure *data*. 

There was one sure way to get a spontaneous ovation at the show: be within a few yards of [BTS](https://variety.com/2019/music/news/bts-most-searched-boy-band-google-1203201075/).  When Ella Mai was at the dais accepting an award and gave a shout-out  to her production team, they mustve wondered why they earned such a  huge roar, at least for the couple of seconds it took them to look up  and remember that they were being shown on screen standing right behind  the K-pop group. Meanwhile, the audience at the MGM Grand Garden Arena  in Las Vegas seemed glad enough to see the [Jonas Brothers](https://variety.com/t/jonas-brothers/) back in action, but they were *really*glad  to see Joe Jonas walk over to BTS in the front row for a quick  handshake. **Surely he knew paying honor to the new kings of pop would  earn him some points among what might currently be the worlds most  rabid social-media fan base.**

At the risk of seeming to suck up to that very same fan base, BTS  performance of Boy With Luv was **one of the telecasts highlights**,  largely for the sheer charm that came with [Halsey](https://variety.com/2019/music/news/halsey-jonas-brothers-zedd-to-headline-iheartmedia-wango-tango-concert-1203194442/)  gamely interjecting herself as the boy bands first girl member.  Choreography-focused or not, **it was a Grammy moment**, in a show that  largely eschews the collaborations of Musics Biggest Night.",20,97,False,self,,,,,

And I am *so* tired of the stylist going OK, Jins shoulders are about two sizes larger than his waist, but heck, we dont need to get his jacket tailored. They make him look like a high school kid whose mom bought him a suit jacket and figured hed grow into it. 

It seems like lately the stylists have been going for a very boxy, drapey cut for their suits and while I wouldnt expect them to stick with English-cut suits forever, they seem to be dressing the guys like they have a multitude of body flaws to hide. Really, that aint required.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Its my first BTS concert and Im so disappointed that I missed the preorder already :( Im new to all of this and its so complicated to navigate!

Hi! I'm a k-army who became interested in BTS latey. (My apologies for my not-very-fluent English. I have no experience living abroad) Few months ago I kind of stumbled upon this site and having a great time since then!
I really respect you i-lovelies for your sincere love and passion for the boys whose language you cannot understand at all.

For the past few months, while watching various bts clips like bon voyage or kkul fm, I found  some subtitles not delivering the full meaning of original sentence enough or explaining the context properly quite often. 

Dont misunderatand for I truely appreciate all the hard work and devotion of many precious translators and I totally underatand these cases- imo Korean is one of the most complicated and detailed language in the world, and with the boys! Mostly there are a lot of things happening at the same time . But sometimes I felt kind of sorry for the armys who cannot fully enjoy and laugh without knowing the original meaning or situation.
(i.e. situations like JK not using honorifics to the hyungs or hyungs bowing to JK are REALLY a big deal which don't fail to be the most hillarious moment)
And I also found a few people here asking quetions about some translations or cultural things they are not aware of.

I happened to have some free time today, so I thought I can answer some questions, if you have any. If there was anything you weren't able to really understand or have been wondering due to language or cultural  barrior,let me answer you as far as I can
But if this post is not proper, please don't mind to remove it!",210,324,False,self,,,,,

However, I was wondering whether the moment was part of something inevitable rather than life changing. Im thinking back to their press conference during YNWA era where they mentioned that a stadium tour in the US was a goal for them as they had just sold out multiple arenas. This at the time, was the biggest tour that a Korean group had done in the US at that time and it was before the BBMA noms were even announced. Another thing to think about is that wings had landed them a top 40 in 2016 and they were only growing. By that logic wouldnt a number one have been possible eventually?

I have been thinking about discussing this in the sub for a while now but I thought it was good to wait for everyone to listen to the album and the promotional content about the album and form their opinions first. 

The reason I titled the topic this way was because of a comment I saw on the sub when one ARMY said they hadnt slept for 24hours so that they could stream BWL on YouTube and the response from another ARMY  was more in the line of I consider BTS as one of my hobbies and I wouldnt spend so much time on them the response implied that staying up to stream was excessive/obsessive and unhealthy. 

I couldnt help but wonder why is a fan staying up during one of the two days in a year the artist they support releases a new album excessive. There was a lot of buildup to this album and the new era and the fandom made several goals to achieve. Overall, there was an air of festivity around the comeback day. 
 
My main questions are centred around;

1. Fanculture

What does BTS mean to you? 
Is you being an ARMY a time consuming and unhealthy practice?
I know we have discussed fanculture in regards to ensuring you maintain a healthy balance between being a Stan and your real life so I was hoping we can talk more about why is it frowned upon to find time to just focus on BTS related activities. Things like staying up for 24hours is never questioned when you have to do it for school or work but all of a sudden its considered excessive when its related to an artist you love and actually makes you feel happy and not stressed at the end of the 24 hours. 

2. Do you sometimes feel like BTS arent treated like human beings? 

I ask this in regards to the discussion that was going on after the release of Persona.  When BTS said it was an album dedicated to fans and especially BWL and HOME are songs sung specifically for/about ARMY there were some fans in the sub who said they didnt like that. Some of the comments I read said it was fanservice, trite, shallow, religious. The religious part came from a comment that said BTS talks about ARMY religiously that its gotten tiresome and annoying. 

So the Do you view BTS as human beings? is because the above statements felt like they were dismissing the members emotions. Is it so hard to believe that the members love and care about ARMY to the point they wanted to write songs about that? They have talked about and thanked ARMY during all their award speeches. Jimin talked about feeling so touched when he watched a Young Forever fancam that had the fans singing during a time when he was questioning why is he an idol and that the video made him cry, feel comforted and realise that he does this because of moments like those. Other members have also talked about finding strength or comfort from the kind words of ARMY. I found it such a BTS thing for them to be inspired by their daily lives to write the songs in Persona, especially now that that are at a more happy and content place in their lives and careers. 

My interpretation of BTS dedicating Persona was more inline with how they are curious to learn about us hence the a poem of small things title and also that only ARMY would understand and appreciate lyrics and references made since it was a throwback to old eras. They also knew only we can appreciate an album where they talk about what makes them happy, their struggle with feeling lonely/empty due to the fame since we have walked with then this far and they have shared more personal struggles with us like MAMA 2018. 

P.S: Calling any of the songs or the album fanservice really stood out to me as a growing sentiment judging by the number of similar comments and the number of upvotes said comments got. 
Fanservice, from my understanding of kpop subcutlure, is what idols do to purely entertain their fans. I doubt the members go around dressed up as cute animals or food and doing aegyo in their daily lives. But they do this for fanmeets, festa and the like because they know AMRY likes it and makes them laugh or smile. So which part of MOTS:Persona feels like fanservice? 

If you need further clarification please let me know. 

I hope we can have a respectful and productive discussion out of this.

Unlike most of you, I'm pretty casual of a BTS fan, I've only been into Kpop since last September and only really got into BTS since after persona. Anyways, I got a ticket for the concert at the rose bowl today and I was looking for some advice:


1. How long before the concert should I wait? it starts at 7:30 and for me its 11:30,when should I go?


2. What songs should I listen to so I can be ready? So far I've listened to their more famous title tracks, all of persona, and a lot of LY ( the solo's, anpanman, magic shop etc.)


3. Do you guys have any other advice?

I've even made a list of things to look forward to:

**Unit Collabs**
* Remember how excited we get whenever there's even a hint of a unit? That excitement's going to be there 24/7 until all 7 members get together again.

**Twitter/ Fancafe Madness**
* Members whining about missing the enlisted members. Jimin when Hobi enlists will be pretty pathetic - aly hilarious. Boy can't go one week without his roomie. The members who don't enlist yet are in for some pain.

** Content**
* Content released from the dungeon. All those never seen dance practices, bombs and remixed stuff Big Hit has hidden will probably see the light of day. All hail Mandatory Enlistment!

* Content currently being filmed. You best believe BTS and Big Hit have got everything mapped out down to the last T -from the first member enlistment to the last. I'm just itching to see what they have for us!

**Continuation of self-composed songs**

**Comeback**
* And for the most important one - the first comeback after the last enlisted member gets back! I'm getting chills just thinking about it. The excitement will be palpable! What would the album's concept be The boys will now have the experience of military life. What will they talk about!

On the same note, the first concert after enlistment...! Imma stop here. I'm finding it hard to control myself.

Note: everything here applies even if all the members enlist together. But I doubt that will happen, tbh.

I was originally planning on wearing this but then idk if itd be kinda embarrassing/weird... any thoughts on this? another option would be making a cute and comfy outfit that somehow ties into bts (inspo by a song or member, maybe pink themed for persona?) I know people do this sort of thing for blackpink concerts (cute black and pink outfits) especially rather than wearing merch. 


tldr: outfit with unofficial bts hoodie that has old logo or make my own outfit w/o merch thats bts inspired/related? I would also appreciate some insight on what most concert-goers wear or what you personally recommend! thanks!!

No purses or backpacks (unless they are clear). Apparently, anyone who bought the tickets resale didnt get a notification from the stadium (at least thats what I surmised from talking to people in line). 

Also, the stadium didnt seem prepared for the crowd. There were several lines, and when we asked the security/stadium employees where to go, they literally said they cant tell which line is for merchandise and which is to go in. It was a madhouse. We actually chose to go around toward the back/side of the stadium and got inside in less than 20 minutes. Just by using a different gate. I strongly recommend. 

Also, its an open air stadium and it got pretty cold once dark. Even if its hot, bring something for that. 

Finally, and maybe most importantly, THERE WAS JO C LL SERVICE OUTSIDE THE STADIUM. People werent able to get uber or lyft, and had to walk 2 miles to even get the chance to call. Be prepared for that, or arrange a ride ahead of time.

They did not hesitate to "" diss "" and subtly insult each other and could be quite ""inconsiderate"" of each other , even if it was just for fun . And I think some of them seemed quite bothered by some comments . But I noticed that around 2015 - 2016 , the dynamics somehow changed. Their interactions with each other ""softened"" and they seemed more connected .  I think that as they experienced more and more things together and as the circumstances became better for them , as they grew up ,came into themselves and  got to know each other better , they understood each other more. They became closer , and compared to those early days , they behaved kinder and more considerate to themselves and each other after the shift.That's just my opinion though and I really want to know what others think.

This post might seem weird but, as a person new to the fandom who tries to discover more and more of BTS' beautiful discography, I came to the conclusion that the boys are really good at conveying emotion, which is probably why their music is so appealing.

Anyways, I'd like you to share your first/current impressions on certain songs, which were successful in delivering their message to you, in spite of the language barrier.

For me, there are quite a few, and I still haven't looked up the lyrics to all of them.

**Rain** (Dark &amp; Wild) - I am very surprised this song isn't discussed a lot. It has a very beautiful melody. The first time I listened to it, I immediately fell in love. Why? Well... it begins very beautifully, with soft vocals which give me a moody feeling. It basically makes me want to go have a walk in the rain!

**Run** (HYYH Pt. 2) - Ok. I have a lot of things going on whilst listening to this. It starts by making me sad, then the pre-chorus gets me a vit happy, but the moment the chorus starts, I feel kind of like I'm encouraged? But when the chorus ends and RM's English lines come, everything is shattered. I have yet to look for the meaning of this song but dare I say, it's very peculiar for a song to make you feel like this.

**I'm Fine** (LY: Answer) - Is this supposed to be a happy song??? Ok, this is a bit different because I first listened with lyrics in front of me. This song literally makes me want to cry and empty all my cares! 

**IDOL** (LY: Answer) - Maybe unlikely to be found on such a list, but as the first BTS songs I have ever heard and the one that got me on board... I decided to analyze it too. First of all, why this song got me into BTS? I blame Kim Namjoon and Park Jimin's parts. Anyways, this song literally makes me feel so good and actually gives me will to do things? And it also helps me with my self-esteem? Is it even possible...


My perception of these songs might be off, but I tried to convey what I feel as good as I can! Share your experiences from listening to their songs too! 

P.S.: before anyone suggests, I listened to Spring Day and what I feel cannot be conveyed into words, though I'll say this much: when Taehyung says the ""best friend"" line my heart starts to ache. Why? No clue. Spring Day manages to make me feel all kinds of ways.",6,5,False,self,,,,,

(Side note: I love these boys so much hence this rant)

*So*. LY Tour made sense because they basically started it off literally as soon as the album series ended. We had all of the members solos, 3 title songs, blah blah, everything just fit well right? This whole tour just sums up to about 9 months of touring. On my watch, thats a lot (but I'm not a famous singer nor have I ever gone on tour so who the fuck am I to know). Now to prolong it... maybe they'll come to my country \*lol doubtful\* okay no, but the reason this prolonging of the tour makes me so mad is that they're adding Map of The Soul: Persona songs to it. 

MoTS is supposed to be another album series. Why mash it up with a series thats already wrapped up??? We have the Intro: Persona, which leads us to believe we'll once again get 6 more solos, then we also have Jamais Vu that means we're getting more sub units in the upcoming albums! Meaning for SY we're 6 solos and 2 sub-units short. WHY. Why add MoTS into the mix. I know they're the biggest K-Pop group in the world right now and ya know they have to make money but like, finish the goddamn MoTS Series, *then* start another world tour. Like it would make more sense if MoTS wasn't an album series but okay. Do you see where I'm coming from? Like, what will happen when MoTS *is* over? Are they still going to be touring? Like when does the touring stop?

It's insane how overworked they are, like sure, we always get great content and I'm not complaining, but the fact that Yoongi has said the best days for him are when he wakes up and doesn't have a schedule... says a lot (ALSO THE FACT THAT NAMJOON SAID THEY'D REST ONCE THEY'RE IN THE GRAVE). There are moments when they look so tired and I feel like such a worried mom because all I want is for them to rest a bit. And I know 'HOME' is about Armys being their home and whatnot but they literally start off the song with ""i'm exhausted"" like *bro*.

Literally every single army and their grandmother are practically begging for the boys to rest. I know this is how the industry is like and whatever, but even in their touring time they've managed to do so much (even pump out a whole ass album ~~i know its an ep/mini album but its still more than other people's mini albums lol no shade~~) and excuse me but Jungkook, who's supposed to be our thicc baby somehow lost like 7-9kg in this span of time??? Like?? I get being skinny is a must there but still?? Such rapid weight-loss isn't healthy but idk thats just me. And basically just another shit ton of near impossible choreographies (can you tell I can't dance lol) that you just *know* they always go 100% for them. They probably exhaust themselves so much to have everything ""be perfect"" when literally just them smiling is perfect enough for most of us.

An army friend said that she agrees but we also have to keep in mind that they boys are workaholics and live off the adrenaline of touring and being with their fans, and if SY didn't happen they'd still be working or doing something. And yeah, she's right, but we all saw Burn The Stage, and we also know how last year even though they were going through this same popularity high, they still almost broke up. They almost disbanded in their biggest year as a K-Pop. And I'm repeating myself but that fucking says a *lot*.

I just feel like this tour should've waited. Should've started next year after Map of the Soul was done, give the boys some time to rest, and then come back stronger than ever. Literally every single army would wait for them like we're not the craziest fandom for nothing. Like wouldn't we all sleep so well knowing the boys were getting a good, full-night's sleep? I fucking would.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as to why I'm a hypocrite: The tour started yesterday and I've watched a few performance videos and those stage upgrades are fucking insane and I'm kinda living for it. This tour also gives me hope that I *might* someday see them live so. *Still*, am a *mad* hypocrite.

Dunno if I missed anything, but thats all from me for now. This is all out of concern for the boys.

My 1st BTS concert was on 05/04/19. Actually, it's my 1st ever concert of any sorts. I had a good time and enjoyed the concert. The ARMY we met were all welcoming and the energy of ARMY in the stadium was exhilarating! 

Seeing BTS perform live was an amazing experience, compared to watching videos online. 

As we were leaving our hotel room early Sunday morning to catch our flight back home and waiting for the hotel elevator, I mustered up the courage and nervously told my spouse, J-Hope was my favorite, lmao!

J-Hope is my bias now because he notice and pointed at us at Saturday's concert!!! Lmao! 

My spouse says J-Hope noticed me and not us, even though we were both dressed up and she was standing in front of me. 

She tells me J-hope notice me because I was a guy who was dressed up vs the many girls who come dressed up. 

We will never know for sure.... but the hope of being notice by a BTS member that night came true when J-Hope looked at us or at our immediate seating area and pointed. 

Even now I still wonder....if our eyes locked that night. LMAO!

It's to bad my phone was on photo mode and not video mode. So we only have one average quality photo of J-Hope pointing at us (me depending on who you ask). Phone camera didn't focus fast enough and I couldn't turn on video mode quick enough.",1,9,False,self,,,,,

Ive had a day to process seeing BTS live for the first time for the Sunday showing at the Rose Bowl.  I had an amazing time and now wish I went for both days!  Here is the thing,  I had great tickets BUT I feel like I missed half the show because I couldnt see when the boys migrated to different parts of the stage.  They said that they will be back and Im assuming they will do the Rose Bowl again.  Id like to make a better informed decision next time since I paid a pretty penny for floor seats but now I kinda wish I had elevated seats in the stands.  For those who attended Rose Bowl, I would love to hear the positives and not so positive reviews of your seats so that if they come back we can make a better informed decision.

Here is my review of my seat (note Spoilers ahead)

Section A4 alongside the strip that connects the main stage and middle stage. Row 11.

Positives

Eye contact with the boys, especially as they walked up and down the strip. You are so close to them at certain parts of the show. They are very good about covering all parts of the stages.
Soundcheck - although you didnt get to sit in your seats and it was first come first serve. Seeing them in daylight in this intimate environment was amazing.
Sensory experience - Fire/water/smoke/confetti all right in your face

Not so positive 

I couldnt see anything performed on the main stage or middle stage.  I ended up watching the monitors most of the time.  Which bummed me out because it was all the choreography.  My husband who is over 6 feet tall also couldnt see the acts on the two stages.
Confusion on where to look when they were on the middle stage.  Half of use where facing backwards and half of us facing forward.  
The water...... it was a very cold night and they did it twice..


Who do I recommend these seats for

People who want to see the members up close and personal and they are okay watching the parts of the show on the screens

Does anybody know any sites that sell the real ones? I know its going to be really busy at the actual concert so Id like to avoid the crowd :)

Im a female, turning 24 this month, and live in the city. My account was at 100% completion but this was my first time using 1iota so they didnt have any attendance data for me.

People who went to rose bowl said that people were camping outside because the number on your ticket isnt the seat you have for soundcheck, is it gonna be like that for europe too?  it seems really dumb and inconvenient to have to switch seats lol and I cant get there super early to get a good spot either

Does anyone have any tips or advice? thank you!",14,18,False,self,,,,,

I bought these Speak Yourself shirts during the promotional period, but unfortunately, NONE of them fit me right because I'm a petite person, so I'm selling them for the exact price I paid for them. Each item will have a flat shipping rate of $10 which will cover the shipping fee I had to pay plus the domestic priority (2-3 business day) shipping to you. I'm not looking to make any profit, just trying to make back the money I spent. All items are mint condition, I tried them on once for like a second...

&amp;#x200B;

**I prefer PayPal Goods &amp; Services** (you would pay the fee), but am open to other payment types (if you don't want to pay G&amp;S fee).

&amp;#x200B;

I've included an additional picture of each shirt with the measurements I took myself. This is to prevent you from buying a shirt that doesn't fit you like I did... Before you buy, please measure one of your shirts that fits you well and compare it to the measures in the picture. ***All these shirts were advertised as medium, but in my opinion, they are bigger.***

Recently, up until the present, fans have been arguing and pinpointing the pros and cons of the fansites in the Twitter platform. Needless to say, Armys are divided of their opinions. Some extremist here and there, and suffice to say that it's bringing a lot of negativity in the fandom. 

The incident, if I'm not mistaken, started with the breaking of the the rules in the LY:SY tour in Rosebowl. From my perspective, its actually a simple matter of following the rules but it got blown up to huge proportions bringing a lot of issues. 

I am aware that fansite culture has been a tradition in the music industry predominantly in K-pop. I searched and I think this article from 2013 sums up what is the ""ideal"" fansite.

I would like to hear your thoughts on the following:

1. Importance and it's impact of fansites to the artist and the fandom

2. Legality of the subject matter (i.e right to privacy, copyright, infringement (profiting), waiver of the kpop industry)

3. Limitations of their work through fandom perspective, standards that might be kept.

4. Others, solutions to the problem that might help our fandom to clarify and end this topic? 

(I would just love to read concrete and in-depth thoughts on this topic and not the cursing, bullying, bashing and immaturity of why yes and why no to the fansites.)",223,88,False,self,,,,,

Some of the cards appear to have a line on the front which I tried to show in the photos, this is a manufacturing defect which is common with these cards.

So I VERY MUCH hope mods will let this stay.**

As of November 15, 2018 [EXO is the highest selling artist.](https://www.soompi.com/article/1263601wpp/top-10-artists-highest-total-album-sales-since-2010).

Top 3 are:
1. EXO = 10,617,948 (as of Nov 2018)
2. BTS = 9,815,626 (as of Nov 2018)

3. TWICE = 3.7 Million (AS OF MAY 2019). [This is verified for present sales]

Now, taking BTS and EXO's ONLY major releases numbers (that is the albums that have sales that can actually affect the rankings a lot) SINCE Nov 2018:

BTS:

1. MOSP : 3,229,032
2. LY: A : 165,857
3. LY: H : 129,742
4. LY: T : 114,324

Total = 3,638,955

EXO:

1. LS : 505,615
2. DMUMT : 256,696
3. TPOM: 5,014

Total = 767,325

Thus,


**Total Estimated EXO sales as of May 2019 = 11,385,273**

**Total Estimated BTS sales as of May 2019 = 13,454,581**

I don't think I need to make this more clear but yeah, it is VERY, VERY safe to say that:

**BTS is the now the highest selling artist in Gaon Chart history.**

(*Note that this estimate does NOT include BTS's other albums combined after Nov, 2018 which will actually be easily close to 175K since they sell a LOT long term. On the other hand, researching the chart led me to find that EXO does NOT sell good over time. And their combined sales for other albums sales hardly reach around 35K since then.*)",63,845,False,self,,,,,

TBH, I never thought I'd be into a k-pop band before - I've had friends try and get me into it for the last decade (since high school) and I just never was into it. I'd always been a heavily latin pop/reggaeton girl until I heard the Agust D mixtape and ESPECIALLY j-hope's Hope World mixtape. j-hope's use of latin trap-esque beats in Hope World but it's still uniquely HIM??? I now know he's popular in Latin America, but listening to his mixtape and then seeing him perform live? He reminds me of a lot of my favorite latin rappers!!

&amp;#x200B;

Because of that mixtape, I heard other BTS songs. NGL, at first I wasn't feeling them. As I kept listening, I realized the diversity of their discography and I was so impressed I ended up a fan. What's one of BTS's (or one of their solo mixtape) non-single songs that you were surprised was on a k-pop album?

Given how creative they are with BT21's storyline. Look at the success of Hollywood musicals and broadway's Hamilton. 

RM's into literature. BTS could write a screenplay about a topic that means a great deal to them...a semi-autobiography, historical screenplay (spotlight on unsung or well-known heroes), or social commentary. And I would love to see them compose and write the songs instead of hiring outside producers, or if they involve outside producers it would only be for minor roles. 

It took Miranda 10 years to complete Hamilton but it paid off. It would be awesome if BTS could do something like that.  Not only for commercial success but also because of how impactful it was on society. 

Not all of them would need to act, they could cast actors who could actually do the roles justice. But I would love to see them do a cameo if they decide not to act (like Stan in the Marvel movies).

Would like to hear your thoughts on Bangtan's skill level when it comes to Japanese. I'm not J-ARMY though I understand enough Japanese and Chinese to consume content in those languages. The announcement of their new Japanese single, as well as this [promo](https://twitter.com/qdeoks/status/1126591397350465536) video prompted me to make this post! 

I've recently watched some of their fan meetings in Japan and was fascinated by their improvement, much in the same way I-ARMY are excited about their English. Even in 2016 I think most of the members were still struggling with intonation and pronunciation (them saying  instead of  will never not be cute; my SK friends have the same struggle haha). I noticed that Hobi and V had the best pronunciation among the group, while RM had the widest vocab. In the latest recording of them speaking Japanese (linked video above), while it's evident that everyone who spoke had leveled up, Hobi completely blew me away - he pretty much sounds like a native to me, which makes me think that he's put some serious effort into studying it. Hobi must have a gift with languages because even in their earlier years his Chinese (Mandarin) pronunciation was impressive as well; IIRC he mentioned taking Mandarin classes in school.

Anyway, this isn't a serious discussion. Feel free to share your favourite BTS Japanese moments! I personally love it when V imitates geinin gags. Also when RM messed up and said  instead of  and had to clarify that  ww",22,62,False,self,,,,,

They way they hit high notes is definitely different, but the mid-range and tonal quality just seems like a dead-ringer. We all sort of joke about Rock-Jin, but honestly it makes perfect sense to me and I think if he really leaned into it he could seriously pull off an insane rock track (already got a good taste of it in Dionysus).

I think that Matt sounds most similar to Jin on the albums Absolution and Black Holes and Revelations. Personally I would love to hear Jin cover Starlight and Endlessly, and I also think he would have a fun time with something like Time is Running Out.

Honestly, Im really curious what Jins voice is going to sound like 10 years down the line, if it ages in the same way that Matts voice did then we know itll age like a fine wine.

Does anyone else think this too? If so, what Muse songs would you be interested in seeing Jin cover?",32,68,False,self,,,,,

#  MUSTSERVE 2019
If you're familiar with MustServe, skip to the second bullet. For those who weren't here last year (or forgot about it), MustServe is the subreddits month-long project celebrating BTS' anniversary by doing acts of charity or service. Last year, we raised $150 USD for the Love Myself campaign, and contributed over 200 volunteer hours from all around the world! Take a look at the [2018 MustServe results here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8v8137/armymustserve_closing_post/).

&gt; We'll be hosting the MustServe project again this year, for BTS' sixth anniversary! The Projects Team has some exciting things in store for you (do I sense yet another postcard exchange??). We'll be posting a formal announcement within the month, so stay tuned! If you have any suggestions for charity activities, leave a comment or a message for us.

If you are **interested in volunteering** to help us organize and run this year's MustServe, please fill out [**this form**](https://forms.gle/1SLYHtENKNwsBSkYA) to let us know. We look forward to hearing from you guys!",1,33,False,self,,,,,

I'm unable to attend on Sunday and want to give my ticket away to a member of our community. To make it fun, I'm throwing in this question that I think will be a cute discussion regardless of the giveaway.

The [language of flowers or floriography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_flowers) is a symbolic lexicon that assigns different meanings and virtues to flowers. There are also more informal cultural symbolic meanings ascribed to flowers, like violets being ""shy"" or cherry blossoms embodying transience. People even have their own personal interpretations of the meanings of flowers. 
I've always loved flowers and appreciate their ability to beautifully communicate extra layers of meaning thanks to these symbologies. (BTS' writers and artistic directors seem to share a similar interest, plying the symbolic use of flowers in many of their projects.)

I'd like to know,**what flower do you think best symbolizes or represents a member (or all members)?** If you're really feeling it, you can even include a photo.

----

Answer below and you're entered to win a 300-level seat (it's a good view) to BTS in Chicago on Sunday, May 12. 

To enter, you must comment by 12:00 pm CST / 17:00 UTC tomorrow, May 11. I'll randomly choose a winner from the responses and contact via DM to mobile transfer the ticket. 

You can also answer without entering if you just love flowers and want to talk about it. (I feel that.) Just add !No Entry! to the top of your comment.

    One thing led to another and I was thinking... if an (technically unofficial but official) international ARMY activism/fundraising group were started, would you join? 

I know there are already several groups like this in various countries, but what if we had one major INTERNATIONAL group? 

Theres probably hundreds of thousands of fans around the world who are active and involved in the fandom. If we started a group and it attracted... lets say ~100,000 members... that would be $100k raised if each member donated just ONE DOLLAR to a fundraiser. 

Imagine all the charities we could help out... imagine all the world problems we could help lessen. We could make regular donations to the poorest countries in the world to help feed them. We could donate a hundred grand to an animal sanctuary that really needs it, or a childrens hospital, or after school programs for underprivileged youth... the potential is endless. 
I was super happy about RMs speech at the United Nations assembly. Imagine how much MORE recognition BTS could get internationally if their fans were in a super-group that had the numbers AND the money to help solve real world issues!

Thoughts/opinions? I even came up with a name  that I think would be cute and fitting:

United A.R.M.Y

The lyrics in bwl in particular highlight this: ""It's too high up here"", ""I want to fly not towards the sun but back down to you"". They've even mentioned this in interviews lately.

Yes it's wonderful that they want to stay grounded and grateful to their fans, and don't want to get ahead of themselves. We do love them for their humility.

But we first fell in love with them because they took risks. With songs like no more dream, bapsae, no and dope, they challenged social norms. With love yourself, they rewrote the age old script of the love story. Bighit after all began as a way to challenge the existing kpop scene. And K-pop itself started as an expression of rebellion against prevalant cultural and social norms (sao taeji).

I personally think they *should* fly towards the sun. Even if like icharus their wings burn and they fall back down, we'll be there to catch them. That's why we're called army after all.

Bwl was probably their tamest offering in recent years and I honestly had higher hopes based on the album name and Namjoon's amazing trailer.

Does anyone else share this feeling? Is there some way army can help them feel less afraid?",51,0,False,self,,,,,

I was pretty active on Twitter. If I'm on my phone, there was a high chance that I'm was on Twitter. And by Twitter I mean ""stan"" Twitter. Recently, I started to get annoyed or even angry about seeing how many people on my timeline are going to the concerts. My entire timeline was filled with concert videos and people's experiences at the concert. I even unfollowed a person because I was so jealous and mad that she is able to go to every concert in North America and I'm not even able to go to one (rip us texans lol).

Slowly, I started to notice myself becoming angry and annoyed at other people being able to go since I couldn't. I started to do a lot of reflecting. Why was I getting angry? I saw them live before. I should be happy that other people are able to see them and experience them live. They are incredible live and every army should have a chance to see them. And I really really believe that. So why am I getting mad about that happening?

After reflecting, I decided that Twitter was the problem. I deleted Twitter off my phone and I probably won't be on it until the tour is done. It kinda feels relieving to be honest. I never realized how exhausting it is to be on Twitter for most of my day. There's such a fear of missing out that's just instilled into you. You don't want to miss jimin saying this to tae or jungkook doing this to seokjin and you almost feel left out if you don't experience it at the same time as everyone else. Because of that fear, you're constantly on Twitter all the time to make sure you don't miss out on anything the boys do, but it starts to take a toll.

This is kinda all over the place but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Please tell your stories if you have.",53,61,False,self,,,,,

First of all, PLEASE listen to Jimin and dress warmly. Especially if you are going to soundcheck. I cant emphasize this enough, but there is nowhere in the stadium where u can become warm. Also the forecast is predicting there may be more rain, so I recommend a rain jacket or poncho if you have one. They did hand out free ponchos during the event to people who didnt have them, but at that point basically everyone was already wet just from standing in line. Just...expect it to be colder than you might anticipate, and remember it will be even colder at the end of the night. Also note that they do not allow umbrellas into the venue.


Point two, and this is VERY IMPORTANT. We saw a lot of people that were walking onto the highway trying to find their rides, or even getting out of their cars on the highway trying to find their kids. PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS. Not only is it super unsafe, it also creates a lot of worse traffic problems. Please be safe and protect others safety and DO NOT WALK ONTO THE HIGHWAY. I understand that many people are not from the area or just not familiar with driving in these situations and overwhelmed. If someone is picking you up, please let them know the situation so they can be prepared. It will be very crowded and frustrating, but I promise if you are patient and go where you are directed, youll get where you need to.


Those are my two big things, but if anyone has questions Ill try to answer them since I know how stressful it can be not knowing exactly what youre walking into. Weather aside, it was an amazing show, and I had such a good time with the boys and army.

In my circle of army online friends, we all have our own receipts folders too. It had been natural to start one when I joined. See something that is potentially fuel? Screenshot it. A video thats questionable? Download that before its deleted(its usually deleted within the same day). Media articles writing incorrectly? Screen cap it. Email correction, check if update? If not send in email to Bh w/ proper format.

There are also meme receipts that ARMYs made out of haters. XD I got a folder for that too and its funny when see other ppl use it as a meme when you know where it came from.

So my question is, do you have a receipts folder?

Just like its army nature to promote BTS, I believe its army nature to take/ask for receipts of everything.

This covers everything Ive found about Yoongi from 2008 until debut. Some parts of this might be a little repetitive if youve read my other posts on Namjoon and Bangtans pre-debut history, but I wanted to make this accessible for people who havent read those, too.

The first hint of Yoongi is from January 2008 in the Jungle Radio fancafe. Jungle Radio was a big hip hop community fancafe for amateur rappers. Its also where Namjoon was also most active pre-debut.    



[Post by Min Yoongi asking to level up in the Jungle Radio Fancafe](https://i.redd.it/8i4sgsb9stx21.png)

A user named m.y.k, aged 16 and named Min Yoongi, applied to level up. Im about 90% sure that this is Yoongi, but I dont want to confirm it completely because there were actually two Kim Namjoons active at the same time in the past (the other Namjoon was a couple years older and went by K-merc among other aliases) so its possible that this is another guy named Yoongi and its a coincidence. But I think its way more likely that its correct than not which is why Im including it.

In June of 2008, m.y.k uploaded a short beat for other users in the community to use. Assuming m.y.k is Yoongi, this is the earliest producing sample we have of his. The title of the upload post was       which translates as first/debut cut and paste \[song\] please critique it. It would be the first song Yoongi ever uploaded.

It was [re-uploaded to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_D4VYimhuw&amp;) a few years ago by a channel trying to revive Jungle Radio a bit. Theyre definitely of the opinion its the same Yoongi but as far as I know they dont have any additional information about it.

After that, there are no more posts by m.y.k in Jungle Radio. And even worse, I havent been able to find any trace of Yoongi from June 2008 until May 2010 which is when he shows up with D-town and using the name Gloss.

D-town seems to have formed around April 2009 as thats when their first group song was uploaded. The members at the time were () Nakshun, Tr.J, Baby J., J.won, and Erika. Except for Nakshun and Erika, all the members seem to have been different by the time Yoongi was performing with them a year later. D-town used to have their own fancafe, but its long been closed so unfortunately we dont have a good source of information about who was in it and when.

There was another fancafe that wasnt specific to D-town but was used by Daegu rappers in general. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell Yoongi never posted there (or else he deleted all his posts). Nakshun was active on it as well as on Jungle Radio, though, as was Reflow, who Yoongi would eventually produce a song for.

So what was Yoongi doing from Jun 2008 to May 2010? Its possible that he may have uploaded a few more songs during this time, but I think the number was probably small because he never leveled up in Jungle Radio and in a [2014 interview](https://yoongi-net.tumblr.com/post/174632588578/trans-bts-japan-official-fanclub-magazine) for BTS Official Fanclub Magazine Yoongi said that he composed songs as a hobby in middle school, but didnt get serious about it until high school. He was, however,[working part time](https://sugasuite.tumblr.com/post/149178106008/interview-160819-agust-d-for-grazia-september) in a music studio in Daegu and selling beats he made, so its likely that a lot more Min Yoongi beats are out there but probably uncredited toward him unfortunately.

In both interviews Yoongi indicates that he was composing music significantly before he started rapping. He also said in the fanclub interview that he didnt start rapping properly until he joined D-town in his first year of high school which would have been in 2009/10 (he had rapped by himself since elementary school). 

In May 2010, Yoongi finally reappears posting as [Gloss on PANN](https://m.pann.nate.com/talk/pann/201800070). He uploaded the song, [518-062,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bPlQUYuiQw) a song produced by him and rapped by D-towns leader, Nakshun. The song was originally made for a competition for a festival honoring the democratic uprising in Gwangju in 1980. It was uploaded as a video, which is easier to see on YouTube (the YouTube uploader also added English and Vietnamese subtitles).

In July 2010, Yoongi was part of a group song with other D-town members called   (The Truth of Life). With Yoongi on the track were D-town members Lucid P and The Smile. Each member produced their own beat and the track was mixed by Yoongi. As far as I know no one has done a translation of the song yet so Ill include the lyrics in full below.

&gt;  
&gt;**** **** **** **** **** **** ****  
&gt;  
&gt;**** **** **** **** **** **** ****  
&gt;  
&gt;**** **** **** **** ****

Unfortunately, the audio file for the song no longer exists. Im not sure when it disappeared or if theres any chance that someone else might have preserved it but I havent been able to come across it. 

Its also interesting that for all the pre-debut raps we have, Yoongi always begins by saying a variant of So fresh Gs in the building. He has the same opening in Swagger, Diss, and his first audition video. So it was kind of like the Suga he frequently says now before starting a verse.

&amp;#x200B;

[Poster advertising the D-town Vol 2 Concert in Daegu](https://i.redd.it/1hbatnc1ttx21.jpg)

In August 2010, Yoongi performed with D-town at the D-town Vol 2 concert at a Daegu club called, Live-in-D. As part of the advertising for the show, a member of D-town [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ5bsuLSM8Q) showing all the performers from a previous concert. From the way the other members are paired up in the footage, I think it was probably taken at the D-town Vol 1 concert in March 2010. Yoongi/Gloss doesnt appear listed on the poster, but may have participated in the concert anyway (Namjoon also doesnt appear on the earliest posters for shows he performed at). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Poster for the D-town Vol 1 concert which is the likely source of most of the concert video footage. I can't guarantee that Yoongi also performed at this show, but it's my best guess.](https://i.redd.it/ls212l9attx21.jpg)

Its also possible that the footage of Yoongi came from some other concert since Live-in-D was a very popular venue for amateur and underground rappers in Daegu.

The Hit It Auditions for Bangtan opened at the end of August 2010 with the Final Auditions planned for October 2010. In [724148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h43Cr6CGo8E) from *Agust D* Yoongi talks a bit about the audition process and his pre-debut life.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Its the rapping competition organized by Bang Sihyuk  
&gt;  
&gt;Bang Sihyuk is that guy  
&gt;  
&gt;Who worked with that Baek Jiyoung that-  
&gt;  
&gt;Hyungnim, isnt that the guy who wrote  
&gt;  
&gt;Like being shot by a gun  
&gt;  
&gt;So thats how I entered the competition  
&gt;  
&gt;With my crew hyungs  
&gt;  
&gt;They said we should pass the preliminary round first  
&gt;  
&gt;To reach the final round  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok thats easy peasy  
&gt;  
&gt;The beat they gave us to rap  
&gt;  
&gt;I changed the entire thing  
&gt;  
&gt;I started re-arranging the beats  
&gt;  
&gt;Look at this, who would do this  
&gt;  
&gt;If you were me, would you do this?  
&gt;  
&gt;Listen, which company would, huh?  
&gt;  
&gt;Say no to this genius.

Everyone auditioning had to use one of the four songs released. Yoongi used Seventeen (one of the two songs Namjoon rapped on) and made some modifications to the beat which caught the attention of the Hit It Judges. You can listen to differences by comparing [Namjoons original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEo-2BsNluM), and [Yoongis modified version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBwBU2w5ddI). (I'm fairly sure Pdogg did the beats for all 4 songs but I haven't been able to re-find the interview that said that).

Leading up to October, there was a round of online voting on an app/website called Love Beat. 3 finalists were selected from the Love Beat voting and judges opinions and Yoongi was advertised as the Love Beat 1st place winner on the poster for the Hit It Audition Final.

 

[Poster for the Hit It Final Audition Concert.](https://i.redd.it/f4gkd701utx21.jpg)

The Hit It Final Audition was held at NB2 in Hongdae and was a rap battle tournament which promised the winner a place in Bangtan. Only the final round between Yoongi and Choi Ikje (i11evn) has [surviving video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdW0M0fRnc4).

Although Yoongi came in second to I11evn, Big Hit brought them both in, Yoongis producing playing a strong role in him being taken on. Yoongi has said in multiple interviews that his initial plan was to be a producer at Big Hit, but as far as I can tell he was always a Bangtan member as well (other members like Jimin and Jin spent a long period as trainees without being officially assigned to Bangtan). 

At some point Yoongi had a profile picture on the Big Hit website which you can see in this picture below. Im not sure if it was during the audition process or after that it was uploaded because Ive never found a firsthand source for it. In any case, he mentions being in D-town and writing, composing, producing and rapping. He also lists himself as a 2nd year high school student in Daegu, so my guess is that this might have been uploaded during the Love Beat voting process but if not it would have been shortly afterward.

 

[Yoongi's profile on the Big Hit website. I've only found this from secondary sources so I don't have a firm date for it but it would have been sometime in 2010. There's also an option to click and see a rap video of his.](https://i.redd.it/zwzdkmx8utx21.png)

Yoongi moved to Seoul on November 7th, 2010 and into the dorms on November 13th. He also re-recorded his rap battle songs against i11evn which are the pre-debut tracks [Swagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdAV7tJf0Pg) and [Diss.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmG1EhBntCA) Diss is slightly different from the live version because Yoongi had originally ended by saying it was obvious he won, but in the recorded version he added the line, But I lost. Damn.

&amp;#x200B;

[Cover art for Reflow's mixtape Represent](https://i.redd.it/k8z9typmutx21.jpg)

Although it wasnt released until September 2011, sometime in the summer of 2010 Yoongi made the beat for another Daegu underground rapper named Reflow. The song was called Who Am I and was on Reflows mixtape *Represent.* The mixtape also included a remixed version of the song [featuring Basick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y74CxrkkoVo) (who was also approached about being in Bangtan at one point). Yoongi was credited as Min Yoongi rather than Gloss in the [track list](http://archive.hiphopplaya.com/magazine/article/view.html?category=2&amp;category2=0&amp;mode=&amp;page=172&amp;sort=1&amp;num=7905&amp;keyfield=&amp;key=). The only version Ive found of the original rather than the remix is this [live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SajtQocxTSo).

In August 2011, Yoongi appeared on his first Bangtan song, the original version of [Satoori Rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCkil2Gocrs) with Namjoon and Hoseok. By this time, all the old members of Bangtan were out and the only ones still officially in were Namjoon, Yoongi, and Hoseok according to Hoseoks 2013 [Japan Fanclub interview](https://bantan.tumblr.com/post/177907541434/jp-fc-vol-1-my-biography-with-bts-j-hope).

At some point in 2011 or 2012, Yoongi injured his shoulder in a car accident while working a part time job as a delivery boy. According to [Burn the Stage episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmZ3DPJQo2k), he hid the injury from the company for a while because he was afraid he would get cut from the group if they found out. He also had to give up dancing which he used to enjoy. He also mentions the injury in the lyrics for [The Last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB_AP7DLQ0w) on *Agust D*.

In 2012, he appears as a backup dancer for [GLAM and SeeU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbAagOhXbJ0) and he also has a cameo in Jo Kwons [Im Da One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWgH0DsD0pQ) music video.

959,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2019-5-13,2019,5,13,4,bntaib,self.bangtan,Addressing false narratives / information about the members .,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/bntaib/addressing_false_narratives_information_about_the/,FictionLoverA,1557690609,"Hello!!! I have recently realized that a lot of ARMYs seem to believe false information about the members on a grand scale. I concluded that it's most likely because of introduction videos or other mis-informed fans . There are many such narratives like Jin growing up rich and his mother having been made Miss Korea , or Taehyung and Hobi having auditioned-trained as a rapper and vocalist respectively and having switched up somewhere down the line with Hobi starting as a JYP trainee or being rejected after auditioning for JYP . Jimin having only studied contemporary dance for a year . I want to address those narratives .

First of all , Jin has stated that his father started as a normal salary - man but climbed the business ladder and they became more wealthy when he was finishing elementary school . So he was not rich from birth and did not grow up rich . I have not found anything about his mother being made Miss Korea so I can't talk about that . If anyone knows , please do tell .

Second of all , about that Taehyung - Hobi switch!!! As is known , BTS was originally set to debut as a hip-hop crew with different line-ups until the direction changed in late 2011 to a hip-hop idol group .Most members of the original line-up were let go or quit because of that and BigHit then started auditions for vocalists and other dancers to become trainees. The rap line was the only ones from the to debut line-up (2011) who stayed until their 2013 debut. As such,from what JHope has said in AHL and Burn The Stage , he auditioned as a dancer and learnt how to rap because he was supposed to debut in a hip-hop rap group. He was the only dancer among rappers , he said it himself . But he never auditioned as a vocalist , nor did he ever switch positions with another member . He did not even receive vocal lessons with the vocal trainees as stated by him in The 2019 Season's greetings!!! Also , according to his introduction videos as a new trainee for BigHit circulating on Daum , he was introduced as a dancer and rapper. As for Taehyung , he had dreamt of becoming a singer since elementary school and even attended dance lessons before auditioning as he stated in his self-written biography for the Japanese official fanclub magazine.

Third of all , there is a misunderstanding regarding what happened with JYP and JHope but he cleared everything out in his self - written biography for the official fanclub magazine that many still do not know about . He had auditioned for JYP but it was  to participate in a JYP dance competition that had a 1 year scholarship to the Seoul Fine Arts and Music School  and a sum of money ( confirmed and it was 300.000 Won ) as an award for the most popular. He got in the competition and won the money but decided not to accept the scholarship because he wanted to finish middle school in his hometown Gwanju . He was not offered a contract to be a JYP trainee . So he did not get rejected nor was he a trainee . His audition in 2010 for BigHit was most probably through his dance academy . 

Last but not least , Jimin stated in his self-written biography for the Japanese Official Fanclub magazine that he became interested in dancing in his 2nd year of Middle School ( 2009 ) and started dancing after school on his own most probably . We don't know what style . In 2010 , he decided that to learn properly he would have to attend lessons , so he joined an after-school dance school/academy in 2010 . He stated that he went there on his free time and practiced and that he also entered competitions . He has said elsewhere that he learned popping in 8th grade so he most likely was taught that at his dance school.He decided that he wanted to go to an Arts School a year before he finished middle school but he wondered a lot about which high school he wanted to go to and what he wanted to do. He eventually decided that he wanted to pursue and learn more about modern types of dances so he decided to attend Busan School of Arts at the contemporary department ( 2011). While there , according to a teacher from his school , although he majored in contemporary dance he also participated in other classes as well such as traditional Korean dance , modern dance and ballet . And after school he would attend his dance school/academy as well .In the spring of 2012 he auditioned for BigHit and eventually moved to to Seoul and the dorm in May 2012 where he continued training as a dancer . So he can dance many styles and has a background ( whatever capacity ) in them , used to do kendo for 7-8 years and has a black belt in Taekwondo according to him. 

Are there any false narratives / information about the members of BTS or BTS as a group that you have seen that a large part of the fandom believes ? What do you think is the cause of that ? Do you know the real information behind those and how ? Do you have any receipts or have you just heard things in the fandom and took them as facts ?",79,86,False,self,,,,,

Being a proud Korean American and a KPop fan from the 90's, I had casually followed their success in the US before but Citifield intrigued me enough to  want to watch their Burn the Stage series and then next thing you know, I had fallen deep into the rabbit hole of all their online content and here I am now. 

I'm planning on going to see them at Metlife next Saturday with my incredibly reluctant husband and need info. I haven't bought the tickets yet... planning on waiting to buy either Friday night or Saturday morning for the scalpers to get desperate. Wanted to know if there will still be tickets for good seats left by then from any of your prior experiences? I'd like to sit lower level and have a view where I can see the stage productions well but also get a good view of the right screen so I can have the best view of Jin during TTUT.  Does anyone have any insight on what sections would be best at Metlife?

Also would like to know how early I should get to Metlife since I don't plan on buying anything there. Just want to have enough time to comfortably get to my seats. Are ear plugs a must? I read a lot of reviews of the LYS Concerts last year that the music was almost too loud, on top of the screaming fans. Any other advice for a first time BTS concert goer who is trying to make the process as painless as possible for the person that I'm dragging along with me?  The last concert I went to was Madonna over 10 years ago so I'm a little nervous but excited. BTS has reawakened my interest in music so any advice would be appreciated.

(Did I really just make up this word? Yes. Do I have regrets? None.)

I discovered BTS last year when fake love was trending on YouTube, which means that in a few days it will be my one year anniversary alongside these seven dorks  I kind of want to do something special to mark the occasion... But I have no idea what!

I'll probably end up baking a cake whilst blasting some BTS tunes, and then eating it by my lonesome while re-watching  some Run episodes... 

I'm curious whether anyone else has taken note of the date they discovered the boys, and whether you do anything special to celebrate the occassion?

I was so depressed for 4 months and BTS helped me alot. 

I was listening 1 year only to save me, pied piper, blood sweat and tears and not today. Then I found let me know and I need u. I started after that to listen more of there music, watch vlive, youtube videos etc. I started to read about the members and know I know so much of them and their story. 
 
I have many times had favourit bands and artist but It haven't never been like this. If I do have and argument with someone, If I am sad of something or my diseases (rheumatism and ocd) Is in super bad condition Is BTS members and music helping me so much.

This is a matter of policy, and *not* SNLs fault. Their policy is to delete performances after a set amount of time, then the artists will re-upload them on their own youtube channel. Since BTS don't have a Vevo channel, their company needs to buy the rights to the performance and upload it themselves.  

Bighit has not done this. Columbia Records has not done this. 

I urge you to go to twitter, use the hashtag #BTS\_snl\_Gone and ask Bighit or CR to purchase the rights to BTS' american tv performances and upload them on the BTS channel. 

The Boy With Love performance on SNL was not only their comeback performance, but had upwards of *19 million views*. It was loved by fans and the general populace and we fans want it back. 

Please don't let another of BTS' american tv performances fall into obscurity because BigHit wouldn't buy the rights and upload it themselves.

There was once a famous comedian named Rodney Dangerfield who often used the phrase ""I don't get no respect.  No respect at all!"".  You can get the gist here at about 1:25 in this video - [https://www.facebook.com/RodneyDangerfield/videos/1029186637264819/?v=1029186637264819](https://www.facebook.com/RodneyDangerfield/videos/1029186637264819/?v=1029186637264819).  He had a Catskills-style humour that might seem a little dated now, but kudos to him for capitalizing on that basic theme for years! 

&amp;#x200B;

I mention no respect because there was a recent thread asking, more or less,  why BTS often gets discredited, written off, or unacknowledged. Given that they are, by many metrics, wildly successful these days, I had trouble accepting the premise. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought I'd try to start a thread to discuss this 

Do you think BTS gets enough respect for what they do?  If they don't, then who in particular is prone to downplaying their art and/or their achievements.  And why?

Conversely, are you one of those who believes that BTS is getting enough respect from the right people?

&amp;#x200B;

My  hope is for this thread to be an analysis/reflection on who appreciates them these days, who doesn't, what needs to happen (if anything) to secure the appreciation and respect of those who write them off. 

I'm happy to delete this thread if things get rocky, but I thought I'd give it a try.",66,39,False,self,,,,,

In my case, even though I listen to BTS songs most of the times, I tend to give it a try to other groups albums and such, and always download a few songs here and there, and even share the mv's and watch extra content too. And that brings me to the next thing.

As much as I listen to other artist, for me, BTS is like one of the only few in which I feel that every song (regardless if I like it or not) sounds....complete?. Let me elaborate please.

When I listen to NCT, Ateez or Stray Kids (groups that in my opinion have the most interesting beats I've heard in the newest wave of groups), I always feel like there's something lacking in most of their songs. Let's forget about the lyrics. As a Non-Korean speaker, I can only ""feel"" the song you know. When I hear most songs of other artist, to me it feels like either it's like a ""turn-based"" songs (in which everybody just fills their quotas) or a ""try-hard"" song (like just trying to show off their vocals or trying to sound too cool). As if things don't blend properly. And, I'm not saying that is the artist fault, because we all know that there's always the company behind everything.",11,7,False,self,,,,,

The 6th of June is a Thursday and is four days after their UK concert, but just one day before their France concert. It's a tight fit, so I think it's just as likely they unfortunately won't be on the show at all... but, as I said before, better safe than sorry?

I should also make clear that **if BTS are NOT announced for the show, you can ""return"" your tickets** (give your spot up via e-mail), so that your tickets can be reallocated to other people who applied for the date. You are not disadvantaging other audience members at all by trying to get a ticket, because you can always give them back into the lottery pool once you know for sure BTS won't be on (and we should know next Thursday).

The Graham Norton Show taping information:

**The venue** is Television Centre, White City, West London W12 7FA  
**The nearest station is** White City or Wood Lane tube stations or Shepherds Bush train station  
**The doors open at** 6.15pm

The minimum age for the show is 18 years.

**Tickets are FREE and you can apply for them** [**here**](https://www.sroaudiences.com/application.asp?show_id=1032)**.** Please hurry as applications for this date will be closed in about a week!",27,72,False,self,,,,,

So Im an international army, and Im in love with BTS and their music. Lately Ive been thinking, why BTS? Besides the seven attractive guys part, what is it about their music that captivates me so much? 
It didnt take me long to come to a conclusion. Unlike other artists, BTS sees the beauty in everything, especially the beauty one should have with oneself. In interviews, they dont say they met this person, they say they became friends with them. In songs, their lyrics dont put the blame on someone else, they acknowledge that the other person isnt always at fault, and the pain of guilt is overwhelming. But its okay to forgive yourself. Because we all matter more than we know, doesnt matter if were famous or geniuses or attractive or whatever we feel jealous of. We are all special regardless of our imperfections, and BTS doesnt make that sound like a clich. 
So thank you BTS. Youre like no other, and you taught me that about myself, too.

So what about you guys, what attracts you to BTS? Pls respond, Im curious to know :)",57,82,False,self,,,,,

We shared food while waiting in lines. We exchanged information to keep in touch. I reconnected with a long lost friend. ARMY share with me that the boys are helping them to love themselves. People tell me all the time that they can't understand us - many of uber drivers and friends of mine. I tell them that the community and not just the boys is amazing because loving something so much with other people is in itself is magical. 

How do we be better?",25,7,False,self,,,,,

Im really excited to be able to share this, but during my research for the other posts, one of the things I came across was an old collab Namjoon did with another rapper called Yammo.

The song, Favorite Style was made sometime around July 2008 and was a lightning song which is term they used a lot for songs that were put together quickly without a lot of production and revision. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Ad for the Big Deal Squad Final Audition Concert](https://i.redd.it/ybblqrp6oty21.jpg)

Yammo, who is the first rapper on the track, also competed and won in the Big Deal Squad auditions where Sleepy first discovered Namjoon in August 2009. He also performed at the DNH Night concert in 2010.

&amp;#x200B;

[Poster for the DNH Night Concert](https://i.redd.it/f8o6834boty21.jpg)

This is one of three known songs that Namjoon released under the name Largo (the others are ""[Lalala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsC-i2TajV8)"" and a [collab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAjcAZw-UI8) with Uglyduck) but its the only one where he actually calls himself Largo in the lyrics of the song itself. As far as I can tell, he was using the Largo name at the same time as he used The Nexist and Runch Randa as well. Runch Randa was the best known, though he also picked up some new fans as Largo who had to be told he was Runch Randa, too. 

I'm not sure when he dropped the Largo name since the posting dates for all the songs we have as Largo come from the same weak, it could have been a relatively short period of time. And things get more confusing since some a lot of info comes from reposts and fans had a tendency to use the name they were more familiar with rather than what he was officially calling himself.

Right around pre-debut, it was one of the songs K-armys found and it was uploaded on the [elimsbts](https://www.youtube.com/user/elimsbts) channel for a time before it got taken down for a copyright strike. If you were a debut army that got a group of pre-debut songs including one labeled 1414 you may have heard this before, but I think itll be new to most i-fans.

Another song that had a similar fate (though I dont believe elimsbts had it either) was [Wicked Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWF-uo9MVVI) which was from a rapper named Reslugs second mixtape called *The Kings Return*. Its available here and was released in January 2009.

Both of these songs were translated by [@Ktaebwi](https://twitter.com/ktaebwi), J at [@LemonamuRM](https://twitter.com/LemonamuRM), and myself. The Wicked Man vid was made by @LemonanuRM and the Favorite Style vid was made by [@Iamnotrain](https://twitter.com/iamnotRain).",9,68,False,self,,,,,

Then after a few weeks I started to look into the lyrics and I was blown away even further. BTS was already one of my favorite group but that made me love them even more and I was surprised that they wrote such deep stuff taking about mental health and social issues especially the song tomorrow that really resonated with me. Then I was blown away even further when I listened to RM's mixtape and him talking about life and all the wordplay he uses.

Probably impossible to get a uber, taxi will be ridiculously expensive due to traffic if it can even get to us, the shuttle is of no use to us. Can't even take public transport because it requires us to walk on a highway with no sidewalk.

Does anyone have an idea? Or are our options really that limited?

I'm new to this sub, and this is my first post to the group! 
I have so many questions! Can someone please help? I know i could probably just Google these things, but it seems like asking you all might be a quicker, more direct way of getting to the bottom of things. 

What is a muster?
What does comeback mean? 
What is MAMA? 
  - this question specifically stems from the recent post someone just put up of the 2018 MAMA in Hong Kong. I haven't watched it yet, as i have 2 small children running around like...well, children (I'm currently hiding in the bathroom just so i can type this post! ). It looks like an award show, but reading the comments has made me even more confused! Why is everyone so sad????

Also, just a note to everyone here, this is a really wonderful group of people! By and large, the way people treat each other in so many other subs here on Reddit (and life in general, honestly) isn't all that nice. Lots of snark and snippy commenting. But everyone here is so kind and supportive, not just in your fandom and love for the boys, but for each other! It honestly moves me to tears sometimes to see how loving you all are with each other! I just wanted to say that, as a newbie to this group! I purple you!!!! ",22,103,False,self,,,,,

I attended SYS in chicago and I think I finally know what I want for a tattoo related to BTS (been wanting one for a while, just wasn't sure on what). I'd like to do a couple lines from Mikrokosmos but I really would like to ask some things from someone who speaks/writes korean as their native language.

Specifically I want to get ""Shine dream smile/Oh let us light up the night/  "" But I have a few questions. I guess? First off I'd really love to know if the line in korean has any weird connotations or feelings that I might be missing? I see it translated as ""We shine as we are/We shine in our own way"". I just want to make sure this is accurate and that the lyrics I'm seeing are correct and not like typo'd or anything.

The second question is a little more interesting I guess? I've heard hangul is written different than it is typed. Will it look really weird if a tattoo artist were to go off computer generated text? Should I be getting someone to write it out in 'handwriting' kind of style to show as an example? (And if all works out can I contact some of you to make sure things are legible looking omg).

Sorry for the bother I'd just really appreciate the help as I don't want any mistakes if I put something on my body! Mikrokosmos just really moved me when I first heard it and after seeing it live like I just really want to keep part of it with me forever.",32,28,False,self,,,,,

WE adore them. They sold out big stadiums and they have us =)). I am proud of our boys and get breathless when I see ARMY bombs lighting up the whole stadium.  


But they are not a household name yet. Some people are prejudiced against kpop in general (I understand them though).  


One of manay worst case examples: Kendis Gibson's blatantly mocking, head shaking, smirking, and being judgmental still pisses me off every time I think about it.He is from Belize and should know the struggles. He forgets, I guess. He should have known better as an anchor. He should have been in awe of their achievements, or at least, surprised. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't keep ""the list"" but I hope those people see our love for the boys through the full stadiums/ album sales. I didn't mean that they can treat BTS that way if BTS didn't hit it big. It's just like a slap in the face.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think it is a huge decision to compare them to the Beatles. My jaw dropped after seeing the homage and it hit the floor after seeing stage setup in timelapse. Kudos to the production team and to Stephen Colbert for being totally on board. They know we appreciate them? I don't know how to express my feeling. It is just unbelievable. Do you think the show executives need some convincing? Will BTS be a household name someday (though it doesn't really matter to most ARMY, I know)?

Oh my!!!  My dream I had the night after the concert!  

I was up on stage for some reason.  There were about four chairs.  I was sitting in the far left seat.  I dont know who was sitting next to me.  All of a sudden, from the left, Jungkook walks out.  He takes my hand as he is singing Euphoria.  His hand is so soft and light like a pillow cloud.  As he walks to the right, we still have our hands interlocked.  Somehow (dream magic I guess...or maybe no one was sitting next to me after all), as he walks to the right and then back to the left, our hands are still together.  . He comes back and I kiss his tender hand as we let go.  He continues to sing the song as I was on stage after all.  

Then I dont know how it changes, but its all of a sudden after the concert now and we are all walking back to our cars...but for some reason a few people keep getting completely naked.  Some even stop to pee like there isnt anyone around.  I was telling the story of what happened between me and JK to her,  but because shes naked and stopped to pee...security comes to get her and take her away.  So I walk....then all of a sudden we all hear music and BTS is playing somewhere else like at a smaller stage....we all run up to them.  I hear security say something like, I wish they wouldnt rile up the fans like that as we leave the parking lot and run to wherever we are hearing them play.  Its all seven of them.  They are right in front of us now as we are at the stage and they do a few more songs.  The front row ends up singing the guys a song (not sure what happened to the people behind me, but again, for some reason, the lady to the left of me strips completely naked again and proceeds to pee standing up...I walk away quickly and security comes to get her.  

Then it twists into where we are back to our car, theres a ticket but security comes  over and takes it off because they see we werent just parked where we were overnight...it was just because of the concert....anyway I go to put something away in the back but Im distracted by something in a field...weird zombie animals or something...then it changes and Im in my apartment now, but it looks like a murder scene happened.  This zombie kid tries to come up and attack me like Im his next meal.  I throw whatever I had in my hand at him and run while grabbing the knife from the counter.  As I run....I end up waking up to the sound of my alarm....ready for another concert on today (5/19/2019) by BTS!  

What an odd dream. I had to stop before I did anything else this morning to remember this dream because of the way it started with me and JK!  OMG!

I have tickets to the lower level section on Saturday and unfortunately, none of the tickets at Allianz are numbered. It's a first come, first sit deal, which is pretty insane. 

As my first stadium concert and as someone recuperating from an emergency appendectomy (it happened two weeks ago and I am so happy it happened when it did so I don't have to miss the concert haha), I am just confused/concerned as to when I should arrive to be able to get decent seats.

I was thinking about arriving around 10 am to stand in line for gate D, which is what's on my ticket. Kinda worried about o exerting myself, though. I do know that people are camped out in line already...

So two questions, really: 

1) Arriving at 10 am is too late or is it ok? 
2) Try to sit close to the extended stage or try to get a full on front view?

Then she went to the BTS concert last night while I was just left hanging. I just think that's kind of cruel, considering that she doesn't even know all their names...

I just really wanna discuss how popular BTS is amongst ""older"" armys (and by older i mean: not the teen category).

I am 26 years old myself and I have a 29 year old MALE friend loving them just as crazily as I do.
We fangirl/boy over them in hardcore style and we share an impressive amount of content with each other almost on a daily basis.
But I still find it hard for my other friends to accept my love for the boys, therefore I usually flicker the Bangtan-enthusiasm only between the two of us...

How do you feel about being an older army and about sharing this with those around you?

Also, I am a Hungarian girl, and I feel like it is extremely hard for my country to accept new concepts, overall. The culture here is so different and sometimes I find people a bit closed-minded.

Where are you from and how well do your nation handle k-pop?

PS: feel free to share your biases, wreckers and other favourite k-pop bands as well, I am curious about everything you like :)

Now the only reason this has 9 mil views is from people flooding from Serbian song to this one and i know there ARMY didn't see this because there aren't any BTS related comments on the video. Also i think it is important to understand that in this part of the world unless you are in a small group of people listening to k-pop you most certainly haven't heard of BTS.

BTS has been doing incredible, miraculous, unprecedented things and for us who have been here for a few years (Im an HYYH pt 2 Army), weve seen how difficult it was for BTS to gain their stride and how people frequently discounted them. Some people might not want to admit, out of fear of being sounding petty, they dont think some other groups put in the work or have the passion or talent that BTS does and doesnt deserve their fame/achievements. I am guilty of feeling like this. It also it angers a lot of Army that certain groups are getting opportunities that BTS had to achieve a certain level of fame to get and that other companies try to use BTS name to gain more relevance (not naming anyone). I am guilty of being angry about this also. 

When I feel this way I remind myself that BTS know that they wont be the most popular forever and they are just enjoying their time doing what they love. And that, we, as a fandom, cannot put that kind of pressure on BTS to be no.1 in everything because they already get that pressure from the media and themselves. 

Also I know that nothing in this world is guaranteed. BTS was always incredibly talented and music driven, but it took them a bit to get to where they are. It could have not happened for them at all, no matter how talented, just because. Its that same way we arent guaranteed that by next year another group wont have a bigger hit than them and starts gaining a lot of media attention. Sometimes I feel like Karma is an Army implies that the universe is somehow intervening to make sure BTS stays the biggest against the mal-wishes of others. This kind of thinking might be problematic. BTS is getting popular off of their own hard work and not a cosmic force that favors them because people are mean.

Ive been a fan for awhile and I love BTS for their music, not for bragging rights, but I cant help being very emotionally involved with them and these thoughts cross my mind often, even now, when they are still climbing. Which is sad, honestly.

Could be in regards to fans, the media, songs, etc. 

Mine personally would be foreign producers... or at least bighit should really look into the people they want. I'm super grateful that they're looking for more help for the album since as they said, it lessens bts' workload by a lot. But I also wish they'd stick in house or people they know already. 

I've seen multiple producers talking about songs they helped produce as if it was their song and taking all the credit, tweeting stuff like ""can't believe my song got #1!"" etc. or even having interviews with the media and having headlines like ""the producer behind bts' success."" As if they were the reason bts are as big as they are now. Pdogg and slowrabbit and others have worked there for years but they were never as loud as the people who only worked with one song. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

I guess I also wish armys wouldn't hype them up since that's one of the reasons they got such an ego boost... actually armys should just stop basically giving clout to whoever mentions bts.",105,58,False,self,,,,,

Especially in the eps 57, 58, 59, 69, 72
I don't get why? Because many shows do change their camera angle a lot. Left zoom right full back to left zoom etc. 

But in these Run! BTS eps it's so hard to catch up the camera. 
For example in today's ep when V talked about the doctor &amp; others listen to them. The trans between the shots of V zoom &amp; other 3 full back to back gave me headache. 

It feels like some connecting edit that makes it smooth is missing.
Or maybe it's because the lightning of these eps are so gray? But still regardless of color, this should feel same right?

I just really felt the need to say how much I appreciate and love BTS. Their songs just bring me so much joy even on my darkest days. 

But the song that was the reason I cried my eyeballs out for 30 minutes straight (a high score btw) was Epiphany. This song is just so pure and angelic. And it fits Jin's voice so much as well! I'm so relieved that I was able to find such an inspiring and beautiful song. I'll surely listen to it every time I'm down. The message is so beautiful.  Here are some lyrics to remind you of your value. You matter. Please remember that.

""Im the one I should love in this world
Shining me, precious soul of mine
I finally realizedrealized so I love me
Not so perfect but so beautiful
I'm the one I should love""

I'm on this Bangtan shit for life. No one can stop me hereafter.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

We've had this happen a few times now (Ellen, Fallon, Norton), and I think we really need some sort of code of conduct to pass around for future performances so we can avoid this happening again. What may work as a good audience for one area of appearances (performances - BBMAs, AMAs, AGT etc), doesn't work for another (interviews). 

If we can behave at the Grammy Museum interview (and Colbert) which had a great, respectable audience, then we should do it for other appearances too. 

I attended The Graham Norton recording and have been pretty vocal about how disappointed I was by the army there. I was going to write a post on here after that night but I put it off, so I guess I'm kind of doing it now... So here's problems IMO we need to address with screaming/yelling out comments (I'll use Norton anecdotes):

* **It sours relationships with hosts/interviewers** \- During the show Graham asked who had hurt their foot, if they'd been to the UK before, what BTS means, and every time ARMY answered the question for them. You could tell Graham was getting increasingly annoyed with this, like Ellen was during her interview, and at one point jokingly addressed the audience with ""I wasn't talking to you"". No matter how well BTS gets on with a host/interviewer, having a loud obnoxious fanbase will always be something you don't look forward to having come on your show. 
* **It's disrespectful to the boys and stops members not confident in English from participating** \- This bit was cut from the show: Graham asked where they're headed next and Namjoon immediately handed Tae the mic (you could tell this bit had been planned for Tae to say something). Then just as Tae was excitedly about to answer, people in the audience screamed ""Amsterdam!"", and he pointed to the audience and repeated it dejectedly. The boys often rehearse potential answers to questions so they can say participate in interviews, so by yelling out you're taking that moment away from them. BTS are the ones being interviewed, not army. 
* **It gets harder to refute the 'fangirl' narrative** \- Graham asked what 'BTS' meant which was explained and then Namjoon added how people think it means 'behind the scene' but it doesn't... and then ARMY screamed for seemingly no reason? These mindless screams, especially when it's over them talking, instantly reduce us to the 'rabid fangirl' narrative that we constantly try to go against. Ellen and Norton did loads of 'fangirl' jokes during their interviews because the audiences there unfortunately seemed to earn them.
* **The impression it leaves on non-fans in the audience or watching at home** \- At Norton I was placed away from where majority ARMY were, so I was surrounded by muggles and got a first hand glimpse of their reactions to BTS. They were impressed when Graham brought up Time Magazine/The UN, and laughed when Jin did his hand kiss introduction. But all of that kind of went to waste because of the screaming. I heard so many people around me moan about it, and at the end as I walked out of the studio I heard the guys in front of me say how every time the band spoke someone screamed over them. Instead of the performance or the achievements Graham brought up, the screams and the fans are the talk of the conversation. It's the same if you look at the Youtube comments under the interview for the Ellen one and majority don't talk about the boys but the screams.

The constant screams/talking over the members disrespects the boys, stops the members not confident in english from participating, sours relationships with the hosts, and makes the interview a lot shorter than it could be because they have to stop/or their sentence be cut off for screams. 

What do you guys think about this? 

I know it seems kinda... patronising? And that's not my intention at all. But I often hear people chalk it up to people being excited but I don't think that's a good excuse, because many of us have attended appearances just as excited and still refrained from screaming over them.",349,2075,False,self,,,,,

However, on YouTube, twitter, and Instagram, I see it all the time. Some armys treating BTS like they are little kids when they are grown men. Im not saying to sexualize Bangtan, thats a whole other issue, Im not attacking soft stans, or that the occasional aw how cute post is infantilizing. In fact, Jungkook loved when armys did the Im talking about full out omggg dont say that Kookie is an innocent fetus like he is 21 years old! Go in the comments of some bts video compilations and you will see them. 

Do you guys ever see this? How does the fandom usually combat it? And why is this a thing in the first place? Its pretty gross imo and I think its gotten worse/more rampant than armys who flat out sexualize the members at this point.

**MOTS:P - Hints**
- Jin's PERSONA shirt
- Back at the ARMYPEDIA event &amp; their MAMA HK 2018 performance, they had text everywhere with ""You Gave Me Power. You Gave Me Love. So Now I'm a Hero. So Now I'm a Boy with Love. I'll Show You the Map of the Soul.""
- The Carl Jung book placement on BigHit's website

**MOTSP: Shadow**
For Shadow, have you noticed any hints? A noticed a few things that may or may not be relevant:
* V suddenly coming out with a new phrase/persona: ""I'm good boy."" As we know, V normally just says ""Hi guys, my name is V"" in interviews.
* I can't find the reference, but I remember JK recently saying somwhere that he's a bad boy, so he likes good girls.
* Jin playfully yelling at BTS at Metlife after he couldn't score a touchdown, saying ""you, you, you and you, you, you - SO BAD BOY!"" Namjoon then says [""...I like being bad.""] (https://twitter.com/jinjoonies/status/1130273921280831488)
* The SHA(dow) text in the Boy with Luv video at 3:59 on the right side of the screen
* The odd ending to the Boy with Luv video, where Namjoon looks like he's trying to wake up from a [dream] (https://youtu.be/XsX3ATc3FbA?t=244)
* In the INTRO: PERSONA video, Persona is also associated with [""Dream""] (https://youtu.be/M9Uy0opVF3s?t=107)

(I'm reposting from the kpop sub to get more input and advice)

So today at school was playing basketball and all of a sudden this big white car passes by and slows down quite a lot. I look in the car and there's an man and lady and I swear they're looking right at me. I stared for a couple seconds then continued playing and like twenty seconds later I look and they barely moved (they were driving real slow) and i'm like what okay this is creepy. However soon after they leave and i'm like okay thats good.
BUT then 20 mins later, they come back and the lady and guy pull up and leave the car. They approach only me and ignore my other friends and the guy is like ""Hey, do you know the band bts?""
and I reply ""yeah its the kpop group"" (I'm not familiar with kpop at all but I definitely recognize popular names)
So hes like ""oh cool, we are from the label that manages BTS and we would like to invite you to an audition this Saturday for modeling singing, dancing or acting, we really like your image and encourage you to come, can you give us your contact information? We will message you with details.'
then im like ""uhh okay""
We talked a bit more about my background and had some cool convo.
I thought it was a scam, the largest red flag being they contacted me through Facebook and did not hand me any sort of business card but I searched them up and the audition is real (I was unaware of this audition before).
I'm not really sure what to make of this over strange encounter but this opportunity sounds exciting, any advice or comments from anyone?

Also both ambassadors we're extremely friendly and cool (I hope I didn't make them seem like bad people!)

So yeah that's the end please tell me what you guys think.",48,75,False,self,,,,,

Many of the people supporting this notion seem to be non-American, which makes it more understandable as they dont know much about it. But as an American I know the type of audience that watches the Super Bowl and I dont think they could handle BTS being the halftime act. Them performing there isnt in their or ARMYs best interest for numerous reasons:

- Many American football fans are at least in some form, racist or xenophobic and would probably not take very well to Asian artists singing in another language 
- Halftime shows almost always get ripped into, even if they are good, Beyonc and Lady Gaga even got tons of attacks online
- Most people watching the Super Bowl are there for the game, not the show
- Exposure to an audience who wouldnt appreciate Bangtan is not a good idea
- BTS would probably be overwhelmed with internet hate
- ARMYs could potentially be harassed, even in real life

I know many people think that it would be good exposure or revolutionary, and many non-Americans support it, but I personally cannot at the moment. I would hate to have BTS in a position where they are subject to unjust hate like that, it wouldnt be run or the mill criticism, just pure and unbridled racism, xenophobia, and media scrutiny.  I really hope that ARMYs dont advocate for this so much that they are actually considered, I would love to see it and know that the boys would put on an amazing show, but I dont think its worth the after effects.",8,4,False,self,,,,,

Official book description \[Source: [Interpark](http://www.globalinterpark.com/detail/detail?prdNo=6503153588)\]

&gt;Recently, a seven-member boy band from Korea called BTS has captivated the globe, forming the most massive and powerful fandom in history. The BTS phenomenon reaches far beyond the typical achievements of pop stars: as Jiyoung Lee illustrates, the changes that have been shown by BTS and their fandom ARMY are not confined to the music industry, but symptomatically shows significant sociocultural changes and revolutionary mutations in art, as well as a Zeitgeist or the political unconscious of the present age.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lee argues that BTS has made fissures in the oppressive hierarchical structure of existing society and analyzes the socio-critical implications of BTS lyrics as a kind of patricide on a social level. Their tendency toward horizontality is not limited to their message, but further inspires fans grassroots movements to bring about diverse sociocultural changes. Examining the relation between BTS and their fandom as well as BTS online-network-based art form through the concept of Gilles Deleuze, Rhizome, she further proposes novel concepts, network-image and sharing value, which are crucial to understanding the contemporary eras art form based on the mobile network platform.

\- *Jane Austen, an intellectual*

Okay, there's a slight chance she may not have said that verbatim, but where's the lie?

From the messages in their songs, to their collaboration with UNICEF, to the humble acts of service they do, like picking up camera cables for show staff or helping fans clean up trash after a concert, BTS is always looking for ways to be a force of good in this world. And, our members here at r/bangtan dont trail too far behind. 

As one of the best ARMY communities on the internet, we have a lot of kind hearts and good people who are looking for ways to give back and make the world a little bit better. Since the start of the organized subreddit projects, we as a community have impacted many different charities [**(read our past r/bangtan projects)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects). But, inspired by BTS constant desire to help and serve, we wanted to do more. And so, ARMY MustServe, an annual project all about giving back, was born!

Traditionally, the two weeks leading up to Festa are a period of celebration with lots of fun contents released by BigHit and culminating in the Festa gathering. What better gift to give BTS for their anniversary than to show them the force for good they have created in the world? 

Last year, we held our very first annual ARMY MustServe, and it was a far greater success than we could have ever imagined! We were able to give back and serve our communities while meeting and making new friends in the process. This year, to celebrate BTS sixth anniversary, we are bringing back ARMY MustServe...with a twist!

&amp;nbsp;

#ARMYMustServe

**From June 1 - June 15, 2019, celebrate BTS sixth anniversary by doing an act of charity or service.**

If you cant be at the Festa (hey, even if you can) we encourage ARMY from around the world to celebrate BTS by participating in #ARMYMustServe and giving back to their communities.

&amp;nbsp;

**How to Participate**

- Wear your best BTS gear (or fave purple shirt) and do something good.

- Take a pic of your good deed and tweet us @rbangtan_armies using the hashtag #ARMYMustServe, or DM us on reddit at u/BTSprojects, or [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/rKF2nNpCXw4kkmHo6).

- Tell us what you did and where! If you have info on hours of service, people involved, dollars donated, etc., send us whatever you have! 

Well be calculating things like total service hours donated and sharing your amazing contributions in the sub and potentially on a website to send to BigHit.

Acts of service can be large or small, grand or cozy anything that makes the world a little better. 

- Raise food for people in need through **freerice (YES! we're bringing it back for this year.)**

- Donate to the **Love Myself campaign**

- Volunteer at a local charitable organization 

- Create fan works, art, crochet, etc, and send it to a childrens hospital, community center or other places that are in need of joyful art or cute and cozy things

- Pick up trash at a local park

- Take care of dinner for a night or do extra chores to help out around the house

- Buy the person behind you in line a coffee

- Anything that promotes the values of Love Myself, Love Yourself, and the type of change we want to see in the world

&amp;nbsp;

**Busy During MustServe?**

Although were focusing on this as a celebration for the sixth anniversary, we realize disaster doesn't have a schedule and there are people in need year-round. If you do any project throughout the year and want to let us know about it, we will count it towards the annual grand total for 2019.

We will be tracking the hours of service and donations contributed by the r/bangtan ARMY throughout 2019 so well be able to see all the good done by members of our sub in the boys name.

There are myriad ways you can support BTS' message of hope and caring. **We will be releasing more information in the upcoming days leading up to the project, so keep an eye out for our ARMY MustServe Guidelines post!** Together, lets represent ARMY and r/bangtan as a force for good in the world.

&amp;nbsp;

We hope to see many of you guys soon!

&lt;3, The BTS Projects Team

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#TL;DR

- 2nd Annual MustServe will run from **1st June - 15th June**

- Guidelines post for how to sign up and steps to participate will be announced in the upcoming days

- Freerice, Postcards for kids, among other activities you guys enjoyed last year will be brought back this year

Sorry for the lack of posts here recently, but we have tons to update you on. Firstly, as mentioned before, we highlighted all the previous nonprofits we worked with in April for our anniversary. We also had the OIAA Olympics, a series of games with BTS-related questions we made to celebrate that. The winner of each game was able to give 5 points to one of the 12 charities we've supported over the last year, and the orgs with the most points will get a certificate for being ARMY's favorite from us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, we finally got the results of Yoongi's birthday campaign. ARMY raised over $4800 to help provide the musical instruments and technological tools for [~~@~~**PFCFoundation**](https://twitter.com/PFCFoundation) to provide music and healing therapy for their students, as well as expand their program to reach more students! Full results thread here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1125889466810470401](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1125889466810470401)

&amp;#x200B;

For May, we have partnered with [~~@~~**IRQRLGBT**](https://twitter.com/IRQRLGBT)**,** the International Railroad for Queer Refugees, who give assistance &amp; asylum to LGBTQ+ refugees who fled to Turkey from their countries due to persecution and even risk of death. IQRQ not only  provides them the the basic necessities while they are in Turkey but also helps with the asylum and resettlement process, giving them a new chance at life. Our secondary activity is writing letters and art for the refugees currently stuck in Turkey, showing them love and support.

&amp;#x200B;

The last update is about birthday projects this coming year. This year, we are letting you all choose the theme for the organizations we find for each member's birthday. We are currently running a survey for the first 3 upcoming ones (Jungkook, Jimin, and Namjoon) so everyone can weigh in which cause they feel best fits each member. We will have another survey in a few months for the rest of the members.

So i tried to translate more accurately.

Comment or DM me if you notice any awkwardness and errors in the translation. Love y'all. Have a nice day!

Translations are below:

&amp;#x200B;

On the back side of a hotshot idol rapper, there is a weak self standing.

It's a little dangerous.

Depressive Disorder and OCD happened to me again for sometimes.

Hell no. Maybe that could be my real self.

Damn huh 

separation of reality

conflict against ideal

They hurt my head.

It was around 18 when my social phobia began.

Yeah, around that moment, my mental had became polluted.

Sometimes I am afraid of myself

because of self-hatred and the depression that came again.

Min Yoongi is already dead (I killed him)

It's been a long time since my passion died and my daily life had became comparing myself with others.

The first day I went to the psychiatrist, my parents came to me to get counseling with me.

They said, Don't know well about me.

Even I don't know about myself well. Then who knows?

Friends? or You? Nobody knows well about me.

The doctor asked me (that you have done BEEP before)

Without a hesitation, I said I have done it before.

Like a habit, I said

I don't give a shit

I don't give a fuck

All of those words were said to hide my weak self.

One day that I can't even remember, when I had a stage, that I want to erase,

Me facing with myself being scared of people so hidden in a bathroom.

At that time, At that time,

I thought the success would compensate for everything.

mind you, mind you.

As time passes by, it feels like I'm becoming a monster.

The monster named my success that traded with my youth wants a more wealth.

The greed that was my weapon, now instead devours me and then messes me up and sometimes it collars me.

Some people covers my mouth and tell me to swallow the fruit of the tree of knowledge.

I don't want it. They want me to leave this hill.

Shit Shit i get it so please stop.

The cause of all these issues is me so I will quit myself in return.

If my unhappiness is your happiness then I readily be unhappy.

If the target of your hate is me then I will step on the guillotine.

The things that I only imagined are becoming reality, my childhood dream is before my eyes.

The loser that performed in front of just two people

Now Tokyo Dome is in front of my nose.

You only live once. Live harder than anyone. Everybody can do live sloppy.

My fan my hommies my fam don't worry.

I am really okay now, damn.

I've denied my essence for many times.

I am an idol, i won't deny it.

The agony that dug at my mental for many times.

At the end of wandering, there wasn't answer.

My self-esteem that I thought there was none of it becomes my pride now.

My fans. Hope you honorably raise your head up.

Who dares do as much as me. uh

From Seiko to Rolex

From AX Hall to KSPO Dome

The heads of tens of thousands people moving as my gesture moves.

It's not that I couldn't attend Show Me The Money but I didn't do. Shit.

It's not that you guys who betrayed us didn't do, it's that you couldn't. Shit

The root of my creations have gone through Han and bitterness and sweetness and even shit from the world.

The moment when I slept on the floor of a bathroom becomes a memory to me. uh It becomes a memory to me.

The debut I did while grabbing my shoulder that was crushed becase of an accident during my delivery part-time work.

How dare you pretending like you've suffered in front of who.

From Seiko to Rolex

From AX Hall to KSPO Dome

The heads of tens of thousands people moving as my gesture moves.

Me produced by Han uh Clearly look at me uh

It's not that you guys who betrayed us didn't do, it's that you couldn't. Shit",28,85,False,self,,,,,

I'm a brazilian army and I attended BTS's concert yesterday, and I was so extremely shocked. We all know how tight their schedule is, but I didn't quite realized it up until yesterday in the soundcheck. The boys look extremely thin and pale, all of them had horrible bags under their eyes and most of them looked like they would pass out at any minute. Jimin was all covered, we couldnt see his face, not even his eyes! I must say I think they send someone to pretend to be him, because why else would he be that covered up?

During the concert, I thought Jimin would faint at any minute. During Dyonisus, the opening song, Jimin stumbled and would have fallen if it wasn't for Namjoon, who held him, and he didn't keep up with the other boys, specially in the rougher dance moves. He was always behind on the stage, covered his head with a hoodie, and during the truth untold, he tried to sing, but couldn't, and burst into tears, his head was falling and he just couldnt keep up.

I was so, so sad yesterday. I do not think the boys have a nice life at all. I just wanted them to be happy. It bothers me how people dont adress this enough- yesterday at the concert no one seemed to realize just how destroyed Jimin looked. 

Thanks for reading my thoughts,lol. Just a very concerned army.",13,5,False,self,,,,,

I don't think having a bias is wrong, because everyone connects with people differently so it's okay to have a favourite. But for me, I love all BTS members so much that I don't have a favourite. It's a first time for me.

I've been in the k-pop scene since 2009/2010 with SHINee, SNSD, Super Junior, then eventually 2NE1 and Big Bang, plus a few more like F(x) and Nu'est. But I always had a bias in those groups. Some of the members I couldn't even remember their names and I never kept up with their music for long. I think the longest group I ever followed was SHINee, but I rarely watched reality shows etc, only listening to their music. 

I often fell off the k-pop band wagon. I remember when BTS first debuted and I liked their first two songs, but I didn't pay much attention because it was when I was really liking Nu'est...which I followed for two comebacks before going off k-pop again.

In 2016, I moved to Japan and I heard BTS more often due to their popularity in Japan. That's when I started paying a little bit more attention, but I didn't start investing time into the group, in terms of reality shows and really getting to know the members until early this year!

What I discovered is that I surprising don't have a bias, but I just love all the members so much. They all have such great personalities and charisma and every one contributes to the team. Now I'm following their SNS and watching their videos. I really feel a connection with them, to the point that it surprises me. I never thought I'd fall in this deep.

Basically this post I just wanna talk to and discuss with other fans what they feel about BTS. Do you have a bias or no? Do you follow other groups?",85,88,False,self,,,,,

We sent several DMs on Instagram where we exchanged pictures verifying that we had authentic cards and photos of the envelopes before we put it in the mail. However, its been nearly two months and neither of us have received our cards yet. I'm not sure if the person I traded with is lying about not receiving the one I sent because I don't know the likelihood of both of the cards getting lost. I know it's international mail so it could take longer but I have sold internationally and it never took longer than two weeks for the buyer to recieve their mail so two months seems too long. The picture of the envelope they sent me had the correct address and was stamped but I still feel like this is a weird situation. I did DM them again after a month passed and once more a few days ago and all they said was they didn't receive their card but didn't express much concern.

They were talking about what they appreciate in a manager.  They said quite a bit, so I don't remember all of it.  Jimin was saying the best managers anticipate their needs before they do.  Jin said he really likes to have chocolate milk around, lol.  They basically ended with a message along the lines of ""come take care of us"".

No matter the size, all bags are strictly forbidden within the Stadium. This includes backpacks, travel bags, shopping bags, tote bags
It is strongly recommended that you dont bring helmets or other bulky items with you, as you will be required to leave them in the cloakroom. 
You are also reminded that suitcases are forbidden inside the Stadium.

3 pre-screening areas will be placed around the Stadium. Physical pat-downs at the doors will be reinforced and maintained throughout the concerts duration.

You will make your screening points transition easier by attending with the bare essentials.

Also forbidden: Water bottles and any containers of more than 50cl.

Really? So am I supposed to keep my ID and such in my pockets? Im honestly confused. Any suggestions?

Does anyone have any experience with Stade de France? Is this normal or is it a BTS specific thing?",4,5,False,self,,,,,

It has lots of funny stories from early days that we haven't heard in interviews since, shows each member's early personalities and reveal their thoughts as well. I found them very insightful and also contain some things mentioned in this sub quite often but without a source such as Jin not being wealthy when young or JK wanting to become a dancer after US trip instead of singer in BTS. So I thought I'd share it here with you, some things I learnt and found interesting are:

\-Their dieting stories and how bad initial days were, a funny story when they got in trouble for breaking their diets. Also seems like the dieting was really bad only for a short period of time. 

\-Not only parents but even Suga's teachers told him not to pursue music as the teacher was interested in music himself when young but knew how difficult it is to ""make it"".

\-RM and Jin's early talks and different ideologies. RM being competitive and driven from the get go since 100 rookie groups debut every year whilst Jin being more go with the flow and getting inspired by RM's one on one chat. RM thinking as long as they don't hurt each other in the dorm, its fine to just be themselves but Jin thinking its important to get along with every member and talk openly about their feelings in order to bond and create harmony.

\-Suga always being the first one to catch on when a member was getting sick.

\-Jin spoke to BangPD about his acting ambitions in 2015 but was told timing is not right and too early. So he decided to focus on BTS until they become the top group and pursue acting after that.

\-V casually mentioning how his singing range is small, boy would be proud of his vocal range now!

\-Apparently Jungkook couldn't attend events often because he was a minor and would stay at the dorm by himself. Also he said he made many mistakes during live stages in their early days but the hyungs always supported him and he never got told off.

- I can't tell if this is the only livestream available so far of their tour. Are there others for say, New York or Brazil that I can buy? And if so, does the 1500 coins apply to each venue or the entire tour? It says ""buy all"" but I can't view that until I have coins, which I don't want to buy yet until I'm certain.

- Can I buy this after the tour is over in Wembley and watch it again?

Hes not a huge BTS fan (I think hes just not the type to be a fan of anything) but weve seen the burn the stage film together and he was really impressed by their performances and decided to join me for the Wembley concert. 
He knows about fanchants and finds the idea really intriguing so Im planning on making a little booklet for him with all the fanchants so that he can read through them/study them before the concert. I think he would really like that, plus I think I would also benefit from brushing up on them 
Now my question is whether theres a website or maybe even a place on this subreddit with a compilation of all the official fanchants?

Long time lurker, first time poster on Reddit ever (looks like Bangtan broke my streak!). Apologies to the mods if this post doesn't belong here! 

Myself and a friend were looking forward to getting resale tickets for this weekend at Wembley, but she couldn't get out of work and can't go anymore. I've been mulling it over and wondering what the experience is like going to a BTS concert alone. 

I've never been to a concert alone before, and there are still people selling tickets on resale sites and the marketplace thread on Reddit so it should be fairly easy to get a ticket. I'm also quite new to BTS (think, 3 months new) but am pretty deep down the rabbit hole and would love to see them live, especially as enlistment in Korea would start sometime soon for them and the concert is supposed to be amazing. 

I've see threads before about going solo but none specific for Wembley, so have no idea what the experience is like. Am also aware that I'm older than the average fan (I'm 25) and so don't want to be alone in a sea of teenagers! 

If anyone could offer some insight as to what the experience would be like/if it would be enjoyable, I'd appreciate it! :)",56,24,False,self,,,,,

But before I begin, I would like to ask the mods, so kindly, not to delete this on the premise of being a personal rantor direct it to the weekly thread. I made it a post instead of a private message as I wish to know if anyone shares the same sentiment as me, or if they have any other suggestions. 

My biggest point of discussion would be the need for a **Town Hall** on r/Bangtan. The intention is to create an open space for subbers to engage in conversations with mods on whats going well for the sub, what needs improvement etc. 

Bangtan advocates democracy. So why shouldnt we put it into practice in the biggest community dedicated to Bangtan on Reddit? 

The sub has seen exponential growth in the last few months/ year. There are so many new users, old users, re-joining users. There are so many great posts/discussions building camaraderie. But there are also many disagreements, criticism, not-so-friendly activity amongst subbers and mods. 

Town hall meetings are used for a number of reasons. Some use it to create alignment, increase transparency, or build trust, while others use it to stimulate involvement.

The mods can use the town hall to help everyone understand whats happening behind the scenes. The sub is growing quickly, so I think its important to provide clarity and transparency. 

Not saying anyone has to listen to me, who am I to thousands of people? However, after coming to a place daily for almost a year, this feels like the safest place on the internet to discuss all things Bangtan. I recognise many active users by username and I'm sure many people recognise me too. 

So, Mods, I pass the ball to you. You are doing a spectacular job. You keep this sub going amidst everything thats thrown at you. Though we may have disagreements with you Im sure this community is super grateful to your team. We understand that you have personal lives and priorities. 

All I request is a Town Hall, once a month or even once every 3 months. I honestly see it as a non-exhausting and positive step because is well on it's way to be the biggest Kpop related sub with the current growth rate. 

Hey r/Bangtan, keep expressing your concerns but in a respectful way. Say you don't agree with something and state how you would fix it. There's no point in just complaining, be progressive and actively try to make something happen. 

I hope these suggestions come across to be sensible and could be taken into consideration.

(Ive probably watched it more than 10 times since yesterday).  Im sure most of that has to do with it featuring Jin singing the entire vocals and performing in the center which is such a rare site.  Similarly, I prefer the live performance version of Spring Day vs the studio mainly for the Jin parts as well but thought it flowed so much more nicely with the added Jin and Hobi parts. I was wondering if others had preferences about other songs where the live performance is different from the studio in terms of line distribution, arrangement, etc...",50,58,False,self,,,,,
