The name's Elif, though I get also called Eri. I'm 18 years old, am a high school student currently in her senior year and live in Austria (the country [Arnold Schwarzenegger's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAXxnvLmtdc) from). I know Bangtan since debut but only got to stan them with this era, and boy am I glad I did. My favourite is [this angel](http://49.media.tumblr.com/d8712554de1765c51c392d61b11a6efe/tumblr_o08r2tyjkv1rhwygvo1_500.gif), though it used to be Taehyung at first. About favourites... favourite album is HYYH pt 1, MV is HYYH on stage prologue (or Dope, depending if the former actually counts or not) and era is probably Run era, though I have a weird soft spot for No More Dream era and Rookie King.

You'll find me in /r/kpop with the BTS flair, but I stan other groups as well, such as Seventeen, Infinite, Winner and f(x). I also like SHINee a lot.

That's about it from my side! Whether you decide to reply in this thread or not: welcome to this sub and I hope you enjoy your stay

A very recent example is that of a reddit/Twitter discussion, in which someone said that Rap Monster copied Kendrick Lamar (here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/3zoj59/bulletproof_boyscouts_rap_monster_once_again/).
I don't understand anything. Literally. I mean, at all. Yes, Cypher Pt. 2  has partially the same flow as It's Alive, and at one point the lyrics sound the same (they aren't), but why is everybody trying to kill each other through their keyboards. It's not that it didn't happen before. Especially looking at American music many songs have the same vibe and are copies in all but name. So, I think this discussion is irrelevant but because so many people are talking about, Namjoon will have to apologize for nothing and feel bad. All because of some few haters (right now I feel like that there as many immature fans as there are haters).
The whole point of this little novella is that I'm feeling tired of being a huge BTS fan (especially as I see myself as a mature fanboy who will admit things BTS did wrong) and I just want to unfollow everything and everyone which/who has something to do with them because I think I'm too old for all that internet trash. So, did anyone ever had (or has) the same problem as me  and just wants to dissociate with BTS (just internet-wise, I will always listen to their music of cause)?

I want to know your opinion on it. 

Sometimes I wonder if they know that we international fans also take part in voting for them in these music shows ....Becoz we can't support them by going to the music shows and cheering for them , I wish they knew we did Atleast this much for them That we do way more than just comment and like
 
Yea I feel like theres a more personal connection with the K armys than with us, but you know what it only makes sense that it is that way cause at the end of the day they see the korean fans almost EVERYDAY. They follow them around for every schedule broadcasts radioshows airports and most importantly fansigns. In our case, they only see us when they have concerts abroad and then there's the biggest factor- the language barrier. None of them are native english speakers none of them are foreigners so they naturally feel more comfortable interacting with korean fans, which im not gonna lie bothered me initially. Like how when they're going overseas they'll always tweet ''We'll go and come back safely'' and thats obviously for the korean fans and when they are abroad they'll usually update the fan cafe saying how they miss ARMYs when they just finished a concert or whatever WITH international armys. But when you try to put yourself in their shoes, it becomes easier to understand. Honestly, I had even stopped stanning them for a while thinking why be in a fandom where you're not appreciated but this recent album brought me back lol . Now I just kiinda accept it cause honestly a part of me doesnt really care about the fanservice anymore. Im only here for the music and I genuineeeelyy want them to do well and be the best but I dont concern myself with the fanservice thing anymore. Maybe one day they will learn to appreciate the intl fans MORE (not that they dont already. esp namjoon I feel like he tries the hardest) but yea one day... like look at Big Bang when they debuted, even they couldnt speak english very well but they learnt as they grew within the industry and now they can hold conversations with fans in concerts and even tweet and stuff in english sometimes so yea maybe these boys will learn in time.

If you don't check youtube every day, I'd suggest turning on mobile notifications for these or you could forget about them!


[BangtanTV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkAepWjdylmXSltofFvsYQ) - Obviously, I mostly use it as a heads up that a subbed video should be uploaded soon.


[CYPHER CYKO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP9OszMqHQG2S8UT-I2wHPg) - One of the most reliable at the moment, she posts very quickly and her subs are easily read. Occasionally posts Seventeen content as well.


[Kimmy Yang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUY6rH-6Nt8VW5zkla4WbZw) - Kimmy's great, between her and CypherCyko you'll probably find the video you're looking for. Her subs are controlled by the CC button on youtube. Sometimes she subs B.A.P, sometimes she goes on hiatus. This isnt uncommon though, you have to remember these ppl are subbing videos in their free time. 


[Peachisoda](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkY0i2m9wWSsaFKZfJ_rRTw) - On this list for the amount of content she posts. Her subs are hard to read tbh (pink on white... what?) and videos are usually only 360p. Still, hopefully she improves, and I'm still grateful she subs.


random ones that aren't as reliable:


[born-subber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ISBNeg07eEVDt-tUxhNDw/videos)


[banninni](https://www.youtube.com/user/banninni/videos) - she subbed a large portion of the My Pet Clinic episode Jimin, Hoseok and Tae were on, and right now she's subbing an enormous amount of clips from a fanmeet (the one where they're all in police uniforms).


[soonhari](https://www.youtube.com/user/Hawaiiano0oFlower/videos)


[Misxing You](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBIi7lztsp4o4eDGZLSijg)


[Jungkookie](https://www.youtube.com/user/missrosiepie12345/videos)


IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Sometimes you'll click on a link to a video and it will say it's been taken down because of copyright etc etc (usually a performance). Your best bet to find this performance is to look it up on **dailymotion**. EG. if I was looking for last nights performance of RUN on Music Bank I'd search 160801 BTS RUN. Dailymotion also has a lot of long interviews you can't find on youtube, or were subbed by accounts not as active anymore (army base subs, bangtan subs, min suga etc). Eg. you can find BTS' YAMAN TV Interview on there.


Hope this was helpful!! Remember to thank subbers in the comments because it's not their job to sub videos!",9,34,False,self,,,,,

I was thinking about making this a weekly series, where each week we post our favorite pictures/videos/audio etc. of a different member, as a sort of appreciation. Hopefully there will be much bias list shuffling and questioning of your faves from these threads.

""I'm sure everyone's heard about the song where RM supposedly says that he's 'torn 4 hymens'. It's been spread around forever that he's talking about taking girl's virginities. However, he's actually using a metaphor:
 



glory - Rap Monster
listen


you said I was pitiful


said I staked everything on this one thing, BTS


you said I threw away those four years years


fine, up from underwater, the underground wasnt happy with me


even while you were ignoring me, the four hymens that I tore


the only issue is youve never even seen me


the real me, youll never know what it is


from the start even my bone marrow received recognition, genius


why might my name be Rap Monster? (its obvious)


the pencil I chew on whenever I see it is the fate that God has given to me


I thought that it was studying but that was my younger selfs mistake, clearly


I wrote these lyrics and stayed up all night to interpret them


and what did you do? like a calculator just doing calculations


bitches who will say my name, after debuting like a comet


no more, yeah its on, try to follow me, Ill rap for you


its all just fruits that have fallen, everything here went soft and burst


you said Im shit? okay, Ill get even bigger until Im untouchable
 



First off, the song has nothing to do with dating or conquests of that nature. It's strictly a song about making it in the music business/being successful. Reading comprehension is key, because this song has never gotten a non-literal translation, like a lot of his other pre-debut tracks. Anyway, notice that he mentions 4 years (his pre-debut years as a trainee and his time spent in the underground) and then likens them to tearing 4 hymens, i.e. breaking through barriers/pushing through tough times. It's a shitty metaphor, somewhat similar to Mino's gyno metaphor that we've all heard, but he's not literally talking about virginities.
 

So next time someone brings this stupid topic up, you'll know that this has been misinterpreted. People will continue to believe whatever, but I've read several times from actual people who speak Korean that he's not talking about what everyone thinks he's talking about. 
 
Anyway, just a friendly PSA. I personally don't care either way (whether it was about virginities or a metaphor), but to hear people use this one dumb line in a song that he wrote when he was 16 to judge his character annoys me. We all know Expensive Girl and Trouble exist, so it's not like you can say he was never thirsty lol but this one song in particular is just not about sex.
 

tl;dr Glory is not about taking virginities.""

Since everyone seemed to like Jin's thread last week, I decided to continue down the list with Suga this week. The idea of this series is to post our favorite pictures/videos/audio etc. of a different member each week, as a sort of appreciation. Hopefully there will be much bias list shuffling and questioning of your faves from these threads. The reason for it being weekly is so that we can really focus in on one member in particular, instead of spreading out among several different members (and possibly being distracted by your bias' thread ;) ). I'm looking forward to some good Suga-based content.",23,30,False,self,,,,,

For an example of this, here's their most recent one where they watch iKon's [Dumb &amp; Dumber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZlT0pfcdl0). 

The idea is simple. Pick 8 things that are almost guaranteed to show up in the kpop video. When they do, take a shot of whatever drink you'd like. You only have to take one shot for the category, not one shot for each thing.

Here are 8 things that I think would work for a BTS video

1.) Someone has a lollipop in their mouth

2.) Someone rubs their thumb/fingers over their lips

3.) Close in shot of one of their faces

4.) One of the rapper line (most likely to be Rap Monster) counts things off on his fingers.

5.) One of the rapper line thumps his chest (likely to be J-Hope).

6.) Guyliner (this one's a bit cheating, but whatever)

7.) They throw their arms around each other's shoulders. This is even more likely to be true if it's a love song and they're singing about/to a girl (said girl is unlikely to be in the video for more than a minute). 

8.) One of the members has a significantly different hair style from the last music video. (Rap Monster seems to be the one who changes hair style most often. Suga and Jimin seem to change hair color, but not basic style that much, and both of them have kept the same style for awhile now.)

If you don't want to do that one because it relies on too much prior knowledge, here's an alternative:

8b.) Camera moves in a circle around them. 

What are some other really common things that they do that you could add in to the drinking game to mix things up?

**Edit:**

So looking at *Run*

1.) :21 seconds in Rap Monster has a lollipop in his mouth

2.) 1:12 V licks his lips. So close to checking this off and yet so far away.

3.) :26 close-up of Rap Monster's face (but there are better examples of this later on in the MV)

4.) 3:32. I didn't think we were going to get this one, but I forgot that they all held up their index fingers counting the number one in the photo booth scene . . .

5.) 3:02. Is that J-Hope thumping his chest or just a shot of him dancing wildly and flinging his arm around?

6.) 1:38 Pretty sure that Jin's got guyliner on in this shot.

7.) 1:00 J-Hope throwing his arm around Rap Monster's shoulders

8.) Rap Monster's hair is significantly different in style from ""Dope""

8b.) Do we count Suga and Jungkook's fight scene as the camera panning around them in a circle? The camera did move around them in a circle but it did so more in a series of jump cuts rather than a continuous movement (a la War of Hormones closing shot). I feel like I want to count the shot of them running across the field but there were so many other scenes cut into that one that it doesn't feel like a continuous circle shot.

So not bad. In a somewhat atypical BTS video we have 6 out of 8 possible actions, with the full 8 if you want to be really generous.

**Edit 2**

A few more options:

* One or more of the members does the side tilt of the head thing while looking at the camera (as exemplified perfectly in the MV of Bulletproof pt2)

* Grunts and/or heavy breathing or other body sounds (such as the spitting in Ma City) is used to accentuate chorus or verse

We're continuing the series with J-Hope! (I did this one a bit earlier because the sub's slow right now, and I might forget later on because I've been busy...) The idea of this series is to post our favorite pictures/videos/audio etc. of a different member each week, as a sort of appreciation. Hopefully there will be much bias list shuffling and questioning of your faves from these threads. The reason for it being weekly is so that we can really focus in on one member in particular, instead of spreading out among several different members (and possibly being distracted by your bias' thread ;) ). I'm looking forward to seeing some good Hobi-based content!

205,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2016-1-24,2016,1,24,10,42dtuw,self.bangtan,Confessions of a disloyal kpop hussy!,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/42dtuw/confessions_of_a_disloyal_kpop_hussy/,lurburr,1453598514,"I had to get it off my chest and Im hoping Im not alone here!! If its not okay to post personal stories like this, I apologized in advance  just know I was desperate!
&amp;nbsp;
As Ive mentioned in other posts, Im a 46-year-old (gulp) mama of two and I had a completely unexpected, big gnarly heart attack in September and two months later massive open heart surgery (they cut open my entire rib cage).  Im fine now but Ive had/and still have A LOT of time on my hands (usually in the middle of the night) with being so sick and missing my kids (theyve moved to New Orleans to chase their dreams and Im still here in California).  

So one night, I was trying to find funny Vines when I discovered the magic and wonder that is BTS through the awesome [tsty taehyung](https://vine.co/u/1145564070188343296).  Since that day, Ive spent countless hours watching tons of BTS everything  bombs, concerts, variety shows, fancams, fan compilations, American Hustle Life (personal fav).  I was alone on Christmas so I consoled myself with buying ALL of their cds, the 2016 greetings, the 2014 memories DVD [and two rings](http://www.amazon.com/Fanstown-titanium-necklace-pocket-cards/dp/B012FUGD44/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453596697&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bts+rings) (one says BTS &amp; one says Jin) so I now have an entire drawer full of BTS and a little flair to wear around once I'm finally able to leave the house and be a normal person again!

Honestly, I find BTS to be the sweetest, most talented boys and their work ethic is what impresses me the most.  Everything is always on point, there is not one song I dislike, their passion for what they do comes off of them in waves AND  they are kind and love their fans back.  I bet they wouldnt even mind that Im a lonely single mom coping with a lot of difficult stuff by trying to absorb everything theyve put out - I don't think they would be embarrassed whereas most bands their age would be, or wouldn't care.  This (I think) seems to attract a fan base that I've only ever found amazing.  Yay ARMY!  Finally, because these boys are my kids age (Alex is 93 and Emma Rose is 95) its like Im able to spend time with [my babies](http://imgur.com/n2FBaoE) without actually bothering them in real life.    
    
This is where my problems start - so fast forward four months to this past week and Ive officially run out of BTS content!! I've watched (sometimes over and over) every single thing theyve posted online and now just wait for new stuff.  *Here comes my disloyal, kpop hussy ways!!!*  When [Jin went on vacation](http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/01/sandeul-jin-and-ken-enjoy-a-new-years-gathering-together-at-jins-house) with two other idols I thought it was the sweetest thing Id ever seen and I was so happy for Jin.  I wanted to see who his friends were so I googled Ken &amp; VIXX and that was all it took  my goose was cooked!  Seriously - at this point I don't dare google Sandeul &amp; B1A4.

One viewing of their Hyde video and I was toast.  Sidebar: The reason my family is so shocked I love k-pop so much is because Ive always been into metal.  I had my kids in moshpits at 10 &amp; 12 and my sons 16th birthday party was at a Slipknot show where I managed to get him and his cousin backstage passes to meet those dudes. I can promise you, Ive never worried if Slipknot would be bummed to find out I was more into Metallica.  Seriously.
 
So there I was humming Wae nae mameul heundeuneun geonde, wae nae mameul heundeuneun geonde I typed in VIXX and I turned on the Hyde video.  Guys  they were COVERED in gothy makeup AND turned into dark angels at the end with big wooshes as their wings exploded out of their backs!!!  It was like the guys from MCR were reincarnated in melodic, beautiful Korean men!  About 3 hours later, my youtube history was a cruel listing of my shame!  I watched shy beautiful Leo, Ken making people laugh, N ordering everyone around, Ravi being annoying but growing on me, Hyuk smiling his goofy smile and Hongbin getting prettier and prettier.  I didnt love all of their music but theres a few songs Ive had on repeat and I feel like such a disloyal creep!  Plus let's talk about how I just spit out all of their names without having to look them up *sigh*.  I feel so bad! Why?    
    
Does anyone else go through this?  Ive seen enough people say they went all in with BTS and watched/tried to absorb everything as much as I have  so is this the next step?  Ive noticed kpop is very cyclical  is this just a part of being a fan?  As one band powers down to write more and come back, you get a little crazed about another band? How to you deal with the guilt?!!! or is it just me that feels like a bad fan (haha) I sound so crazy even to myself but it's truly how I feel!

I swear there will never be anyone that could come close to BTS for me.  These boys and pulled me out of dark nights of incredible pain and loneliness with their amazingly beautiful, distinctive music.  Maybe now Im just going to have to figure out how to go on knowing theyre the closest to my heart but I have to expand and grow past where I am  I guess it's not unlike dealing with my empty little nest.    
    
Thank you for reading all of this if you did  Im grateful to have people to talk to.  xoxo, Laura",11,17,False,self,,,,,

I thought about this while I was doing a playlist for my best friend who isn't into BTS.

The only rule that applies is: don't include Dope. That song isn't a title track but it's so popular it might as well count as one. You can recommend multiple songs from an album!

My list would look like this:

* Look Here

* 2nd Grade

* Fallen Leaves

* Tomorrow

* Miss Right

Though, to be truthful, I recommended her Where Did You Come From instead of Fallen Leaves, as it's got a catchier tune and I'm a little biased about the song.",14,8,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure if she listens to their music or not, but she has been asking me about the members ( someone she follows on Tumblr posts about them a lot) and she sends me memes that she thinks are funny or wants explained (I'm starting to realize just how many inside jokes our Fandom has). I've showed her a couple of Bangtan Bombs and she watched an episode of BTS Run with me, and she finds them hilarious.

 I was going to ask you all, what variety shows/short clips/Bangtan Bombs/fancams would you recommend to someone just getting into BTS? Watching their videos is something we enjoy doing together, but I'm not really sure where to start with variety because some of the shows can be kind of long and since she's not quite all the way in the rabbit hole yet and, I don't want to bore her/scare her away. 

So tell me Reddit! What are you favorite funny/cute BTS video clips!?

Also any videos that are the source of Fandom jokes would be helpful (example:the Bangtan Bomb where they're on the plane speaking English is the source of quite a few), Ive showed her a few of the essentials, but I'm sure there are some I'm forgetting. 

Also she loves Jungkook, so any funny/cute clips of him would be great too! 


Thanks for all the help! If I'm successful, we'll have another ARMY among our ranks soon! :) &lt;3

This is pretty similar to i-armys' nicknames for bangtan, except I see people say Tae and not TaeTae (me included). I've seen ""Mom Jin"", ""Kook"", Yoong for Yoongi, and Namjoonie aside the obvious RapMon.

Do you have any nicknames for Bangtan? What I often do is adding -er at the end of some of the members' names, like yoonger for yoongi, and jimmer / jimmy / [jiminy](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/disneyprincess/images/9/9d/02_Jiminy_Cricket.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140112040324) for jimin. one time i also said ""hober"" and referred to hobi.",24,8,False,self,,,,,

i apologize for my mean comments. i didn't have to do that. i always felt like this but all the haters and the negative comments made me not admit i went overboard but now that people don't really care, finally i think i'm mature enough to say i was wrong to attack them like them. i've grown and living life i realize it's not right to
hate others for whatever they wanna do. i wanna say live your life no matter what anybody says cause i'm living mine. i've always felt like a hypocrite cause i tell people to be free and attack whoever i didn't agree with.
but! i do wanna say everybody has opinions and in your own Sns, you should be able to say whatever. you shouldn't attack people for their opinions. telling people you can't say this or that. i do wanna thank all the people that hated on me and still hate on me cause you were fuel that made me work harder. thank you

The reason for it being weekly (although it's more when I remember to post it after a few days at this point) is so that we can really focus in on one member in particular, instead of spreading out among several different members (and possibly being distracted by your bias' thread ;) ). I'm looking forward to seeing some good RM-based content!  ",26,26,False,self,,,,,
