A much cherished annual tradition since 1972, [Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve with Ryan Seacrest](https://www.newyearsrockineve.com/) is the most popular way for viewers to ring in the New Year, both in the US and worldwide. Hosted by Ryan Seacrest, the show is a New Years staple with live performances in New York along with the iconic Times Square ball drop.

#Where To Watch/Stream Links   

******

##For those in the USA with Cable:  

**Note:** It might not be listed as ABC in the channel guide (for me [I have Comcast Xfinity] it was listed like WJLA or something but it IS in fact ABC, with the ABC logo in the corner and everything lol).  

* There is also an [ABC live stream on their website](http://abc.go.com/watch-live) if you have no actual television around you, however you will need to log in to verify your cable subscription. There are some geographical restrictions though.  

* You might also be able to stream it on your computer by logging into your account for your cable provider and using the **Live TV** option that livestreams channels you have access to. I know this is possible with Comcast, as I've tried it, but there should be similar options for other providers. I've also seen some things about live streaming ABC through Hulu with a free trial?

I've been in the whirlwind that is stanning BTS for the past couple of months, and I noticed a lot of talk about how K-ARMYs can plan ""surprises"" for BTS's concerts by setting it up on fancafes or anything similar to that effect.  I found a helpful guide to get an account on BTS's official fancafe, but even though they have an international section, it still seems predominantly Korean.  This got me wondering if the fancafes are really used amongst international fans, or if we have our own version of it?  Do any of y'all use it (or have tried)?  If not, what do you use in place of it?  Would love to hear feedback about this!

Morever, I've heard a lot of people saying that this ""intense stage"" lasted months rather than weeks. Like, losing hours upon hours of your life eating up BTS content, watching videos, reading interviews, scrolling through social media, e.t.c. For a really long time. Almost compulsively.

It's kind of a curious thing, so I was wonderinghow many of you actually did experience this kind of ""intense period"", and if so how many days/weeks/months did it take before you calmed down?

I havent been in this forum long, and I know Im not as active as Id like to be, but Ive felt so welcomed and overwhelmed at the amount of thoughtfulness and respect here. I honestly came here for Bangtan but ended up staying for ARMY. In thankfulness and looking forward to what Im sure will be a brilliant 2018 for BTS and ARMY, Id been thinking what I could contribute. With my profile/background as an older-aged, newer Korean fan that lived through the glory days of Seo Taiji and the first-generation idols, I feel that what I can best gift to other ARMYs is my appreciation, encouragement, and advice.  

I also invite any other first-generation (or even early second-gen) fans to contribute. Lets have a thread of love and appreciation to usher in the new year! ^ ^

APPRECIATION: In my more than 20 years of being in or being around K-pop, I have never seen a fandom like ARMY. There are so many things that make you guys unique and amazing, but for me personally what I most appreciate is the maturity and the respectful intelligence. I honestly never thought so many would be interested and engaged by my first post on the distinction between Kpop and Korean music, because quite frankly most Kpop fans tend are interested in idols looks, dance moves, and music video visuals. The ability that so many of you have, of thinking and expressing yourselves critically with respect and with little to no ego is not something I encountered much even when working in a profession where everyone had like 3 PhDs, and its very precious.

ENCOURAGEMENT: My encouragement is related to my advice just below: I encourage you to know that the Korean general public is now on your side. Or rather, the single most important demographic to Korean pop culture is on your side now. A week or so ago, I found out that 2 of my colleagues around my age or older are also now ARMYs. Us noonas and ahjummas are a force to be reckoned with. When we decide well like or support something or someone, we do so until the end and we make sure our children and relatives do the same LOL. As long as they dont commit a crime, Bangtan will be fine in Korea.

ADVICE: This part is what delayed this love letter (I had been meaning to post it after Christmas). I wanted to give advice that would be as applicable and helpful as possible to ARMY, and to do that I realised I had to learn more about the history of the fandom, so I took time to do that. What Ive found is that this fandom has its own Han, similar to BTS themselves. I feel sorry that I wasnt aware of all the suffering that happened as it was happening. Typical of a 30-something year-old worker, I didnt follow the news beyond the political and economics of the country. I think, though, that with Bangtan going into a new phase and uncharted territory, the fandom may need to undergo a process of Han-puri, a releasing of Han or reconciliation of Han. In other words, as much as possible, I think ARMYs should unite to heal each other from now on  not necessarily forget the past (because I think new fans have a right to know)  but to encourage each other with the truth that circumstances have vastly changed and that theres now far less need to lash out at famous or music industry people who show interest in BTS or ARMY or start Internet witch hunts. The Han-puri might happen more on an individual level rather than a collective or vice-versa, but without it my concern is that protection of your idols could easily turn into possessiveness and the fandoms passion be driven more by an unhealthy need to prove something rather than pure joy.

So lets heal our broken wings and help heal each others, because, of courseWings are made to fly ^ _ ~

We hope you had a wonderful holiday season. Over the holidays, we've successfully completed the JIN and V Birthday Projects!

#BIRTHDAY BOOKS
As always, our messages &amp; art have been compiled into a book. [Here is a quick video](https://youtu.be/mctiDrD4C5A) of the finished products for JIN and V! We'd like to thank the lovely u/AverageAnnie for receiving [the books](https://imgur.com/nYnKvD1) in Korea and sending them on to Big Hit.


**JIN's book** had an #EatARMY theme, and was formatted [similar to a cookbook](https://imgur.com/x0qNMTT). **V's book** had a V-isual art theme, and was in an [Instagram-inspired format](https://imgur.com/6uLzlhM).

Some details about the books:

- Softcover Photo book
- Premium Paper (matte finish)
- Standard Portrait 810 in
- 40 Pages (Jin) &amp; 56 Pages (V)

#DONATIONS
We've raised **a total of $165 USD** for the two projects ($85 for Jin, $80 for V). 

As discussed in our previous posts, we will be donating to the [LOVE MYSELF campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/), BTS' joint project with UNICEF. **However, as donations to this campaign require having a Korean national ID, we've reached out to UNICEF regarding donations from international fans.** Hopefully, we can come up with an arrangement with their team. If anyone has alternative options or suggestions, please reach out to us through comments, PM, or email (armysunite@hotmail.com).

#ONGOING PROJECTS
- **Secret Santa** - Secret Santa 2017, led by u/Erinzilla83, is coming to a close! If you'd like to check out the gifts received by the participants so far, feel free to visit the [Secret Santa subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSbangtan/new/)!
- **2017 r/bangtan Census** - We're in the process of collating and translating the 2017 census. We ask for everyone's patience regarding this, as we've had nearly double the number of participants for this year! It's truly been an amazing year for our boys.


We'll be posting a **2017 BTS Projects Recap** soon, which will also contain a feedback form for comments, questions, or concerns.

&amp;nbsp; 

Again, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who participated in the JIN and V projects, especially to those who made their donations. We look forward to working with our wonderful subreddit this 2018!

It gives us an idea of what to expect from the comeback and sets the tone for the concept they'll be going with and/or the stories they'll be telling. One of the fun part of the intros is seeing who does it. The rapline has historically done most of the intros so this year's intro was shocking, to say the least, but so amazing! 

Now that the intros are not limited to the rapline, I've been really interested in seeing who y'all think will do the next one. 

This is the current status of BTS Intros:

The discussion was six months ago and in retrospect, a lot of things happened since then. We saw some of the guys switching and changing things up in HER (Serendipity sounds more deliberate from Jimin's part and then there's V singing more in his range for example) and they gave us more live performances after HER got released.

Upcoming on the 10th and 11th, BTS will attend both days of the 32nd Golden Disc Awards,  held at Gyeonggi-do KINTEX (Korea International Exhibition Center).  

On the 5th, BTSs agency, Big Hit Entertainment revealed to 10asia that BTS is planning to attend both days of the 32nd Golden Disc awards.""    

After winning a Rookie award at the 28th Golden Disc Awards, they went on to win Album Bonsang awards at the 29th, 30th and 31st GDA awards. This year, 'LOVE YOURSELF  Her,' setting a million seller record with a single album, is nominated. They have also attained eligibility through Spring Day, the title track off their album YOU NEVER WALK ALONE, released last February.

Since Outcast has taken this sub (and the internet) by storm, we wanted to make a place for all discussion about Outcast, so that different discussion is possible within other threads. We will be removing comments/discussions about this AU in other threads where it's not relevant from now on, as well as sorting this thread by ""new"" to keep discussion alive.  

You can find the link to this thread easily on desktop by looking at the very top menu bar, underneath the banner (it's the big red glowing button)!

Have fun **while keeping within [the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules)**! (And remember, reports are free~)  

[](#v_crie)  

*****

**EDIT:** since some people might still not know what Outcast is, it's a BTS Horror(ish) text-chat AU (commonly described as being ""Black Mirror""-like, if you know that show, or like a MUCH more tame Doki Doki Literature Club if you know that. Other loose comparisons have been to Danganronpa and Until Dawn). There are absolutely no ships or shipping within the story itself.  

*(In my personal opinion, the ""warnings"" the author put on the story make it sound way more scary and hardcore than it really is imo. Unless you're super easily spooked, it's not too scary. ATM, it's more like a thriller/mystery novel than anything else)*  

The interesting part of the story is that at the end of each ""day"" in the story, there is a Twitter poll (you need a Twitter account to vote in it) where the readers will determine the course of the story in the next installment. Like an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure thing haha. It's supposed to end on Sunday, the 8th (6PM EST), with a bonus round on Monday.  

If you want my personal take on it, the most fun part isn't even necessarily the story, but all the memes people are making based on the story in Twitter (but you have to read the story to understand them :P)~

This post is just a short update post with some additional info on the /r/bangtan awards for this year that I announced would be happening [last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7k19v8/rbangtan_awards_2017_coming_soon/). If you didn't see that post or are new here, please go read it to clear up what this is, exactly :D  

#When will this take place (finally)?  

I'm aiming to post it after Muster, on the 14th of January (my time, which is EST [UTC -05]). I'm not sure how long I'll leave it open, but I'm thinking maybe a week is long enough, depending on how BTS' schedule looks, although I'm open to negotiation on this.  

#How will this work?  

The format for this years awards is going to be slightly different from last years, in that there will be two rounds of voting: the prelims, and the final voting. The prelims will be used to determine the top 5 candidates from each category, who will then go on to the final round of voting to determine the ultimate winners. If, for some reason, there are less than 5 nominees in a category, they wont go on to the finals, and Ill just determine the winner from the prelim votes.  

#What are the rules for nominations?  

1. You may vote for as many nominations as you wish.  
2. DO NOT REPLY TO ANY NOMINATIONS WITHIN THE VOTING THREAD. I will remove any replies I see. If you want to discuss nominations, do it in this thread!  
3. Please give a link/source for any videos and gifs you use in your nominations. Since this thread is going to be archived, its good to know what something was if its removed later on :)  
4. You can nominate as many things in as many categories as you wish.  
5. [Subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) still apply.  

****

I will copy/paste all of that info into the voting thread when it actually opens, in the meantime if you need/want any further clarification please let me know and I'll do my best to answer!  

While we wait, please start gathering your nominations for each category (you can see what the categories will be by [looking at my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7k19v8/rbangtan_awards_2017_coming_soon/)). Let's make this year's the most successful yet!

My interpretation is based on [this translation](https://genius.com/Bts-crystal-snow-lyrics) from genius lyrics.

Each snow crystal is one small part of the whole and insubstantial on its own. Its nameless, faceless, we dont see or appreciate each individual one as it falls surrounding us in a blanket and piling up in drifts. We see the snow, not each crystal. 

But at the same time, each snow crystal is unique and precious. Every snowflake crystal is unique in its shape and composition and only falls once. It is precious. It is fragile, such that if you try to hold it, you quickly destroy it with your body heat. And no matter how much you might want to preserve its beauty, by its very nature it will soon melt and disappear. 

The snowflakes are each of us. As members of ARMY, we might not be known to them individually, but we are still unique and precious to them. We gave them the greatest gift  the courage to go on as themselves, being BTS, making their music and sending their message with our support. Coming together like this, the love that we share for each other, with their music and message and our support, is a small miracle. We hope to change the world together, though were not sure exactly how yet. And who knows what that will look like when we are done?

And they believe that we will fly higher than they ever could. They support and cherish us just as we cherish them. They treasure the love we give them and hope to touch our hearts with their music, but feel they can never perfectly get there. This beauty and love surrounds them, and yet, because we are artist and fan, it remains strangely unrequited. They can never hold us and we can never hold them. We pass through them and become water (the sea from Sea) and they watch from afar as our light reflects every sparkling thing the goodness and light that ARMY spreads in the world with acts of love, charity, positivity, and fighting for what we believe in.

And though we might wish for 100 years together, someday we will disappear and leave them.

But even if I want to meet you is a lie they still love us. They want to hold us once more, touch our hearts once more, with one more concert, one more song, one more letter, one more cheer, before we disappear. They want to protect us once more before the tears fall (ours, from the hardships of life, or theirs, when we leave them). 

None of us really chose this particular fate, who we were born or the colors we are painted with that they should be the ones to stand on stage, to spill their blood, sweat and tears, speaking harsh words criticizing society, fighting the haters, and protecting the earnestness of youth, with us on the other side protecting them, speaking good and comforting truths like warm breath fogging up in the cold night, positive phrases of support and love for them and each other. Fate put us here on these sides, but still we are together. 

And even after parting, when the last song is sung, when the last dance is done, when we youth are fighting the heartless banality of adulthood; when we clear-hearted adults cross oceans in search of truths, write words of comfort or protest, or come to know the joy of new mothers or fathers; when we parents cheer children who go boldly into the world and welcome the smiles of our first grandchildren; someday BTS will come back into our lives. A song or a photo will trigger a memory of a feeling of peaceful happiness, of being one among a million snow crystals quietly falling on a dark and starless night. ",23,98,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently in the process of converting several of my friends to BTS/Kpop fans. They lean more on the ""intellectual"" side of things, so even after all the videos I've shown them, they still remain unconvinced and are insistent that BTS is only a fad.

Could a redditor please help me out and link me some articles (by MAJOR U.S./Western news outlet say Forbes or Grammy's) that talked about BTS more than just a teenage fad? I feel that at this point, bombarding them with some legitimate, primary sources (smh I know right?!) is what will convince them, if not at least soften their stance towards Kpop.

Thank you so much!

EDIT: SO MANY REPLIES! Thank you guys so much for all y'all support, you really are the best. 

EDIT 2: Some of you asked why try when they are just ""snobs"" - well, I wasn't a BTS follower myself until someone ""turned"" me one, so I know that there's always hope even in the worst of all snobs. Makes sense? :)",37,61,False,self,,,,,

Recently I fell upon a tumblr account that has a full archive of BTS' tweets all the way back to 2013 with eng translations! (http://bts-twt-archive.tumblr.com/search/170401) On the left hand side there's a search bar and you can type up random dates like 130613 or 160821 and find whatever they posted that day. Naturally, I've spent the last hour searching up random dates and playing around on it and I've fallen upon so many precious hidden gems that I never knew existed!! I thought this could turn into a fun game on the sub for those of you who want to play. (I know, I know, I'm deep in the trash guys.)

So!! Type in whatever random day and see if you happen to come across any gold that you can share here! The goal is to try and find a video/post that you've never seen before and think others might not have seen! Of course, it's 100000% possible that a good amount of people have seen a lot of their tweets but as someone who's only been a fan for a little less than a year it's been really fun finding creative videos Jimin's made or secret photos of the boys sleeping from 2013-16. 

So in short, I guess we're really just flipping through their Twitter and seeing what fun stuff we find but I thought it might be fun. You could either share the direct Twitter link of what you found or the whole archive from that day! Here's a couple days I've found in the past hour that are too cute to not share. 

130416 - Beautiful bare-face J-Hope working in the studio by Suga: https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/324029736147906560

150624 - Editing master Park Jimin: https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/613847786132377600

130401 - The first Bangtan April Fools' with Suga and RM (or Salt and Dance Monster?): http://bts-twt-archive.tumblr.com/search/130401

Have fun! 

edit: Each April Fools year is golden

edit again: It's probably good to give the link to the archive so I added that in there.

I've been working on a tile game for a class project and had recently changed the concept to BTS DNA era. I have the sprites for all members in progress (very messy sorry). I'm not sure what the goal of the game should be? Any suggestions? I was thinking a maze, playing as Jimin (I named the game Adventures of Chims, all suggestions would be appreciated) and you'd have to find the other 6 members, each one dropping a different casette with a different song. You'd have to find all tapes before the timer runs out, any suggestions on which member should get which song? So far, Jimin has DNA.",6,33,False,self,,,,,

Your projects team has been in contact with UNICEF to figure out how to make the donations for V and Jin's birthday projects, and we received a response yesterday that they have just launched their page for international donations!


[**Love Myself International Donation Page**](http://www.unicef.or.kr/m/donation/en/)


**How to Donate with Credit Card**

*Important Note: As /u/maiathbee pointed out, some cards charge international transaction fees of a few percent. Please check your terms and conditions before donating if you are concerned about this fee. Some users below have shared whether certain cards have fees.*

It requires a credit card, but it does not have to be Korean.

Donations are made in Korean won, so be sure to convert to your currency first. 

(*Protip: You can google your currency to get the proper exchange rate. For example, googling ""10 dollars in Korean won"" will return the proper amount.*)

The form asks for a 2-digit security code. My card is a Visa and has a 3-digit security code on the back. I just put in the first two digits and it went through without a problem.

I donated 10,000 won and it hit my bank as the proper exchange amount, $9.39, and was labeled as INICIS SUNGNAM. 


**How to Donate with Cash/Bank Transfer** 

*Important Note: Some banks may charge transaction fees for international transfer (that are usually higher than for credit cards). Please check your terms and conditions with your bank before donating*

The UNICEF representative who responded to our inquiry also provided this information if you want to donate via cash/bank transfer.

&gt;If you would like to pay by cash you can donate to KCU bank account as below. 

&gt;Bankname  :  SHINHAN BANK

&gt;Swift-Code :  SHBKKRSE

&gt;Account No :  100-010-450799

&gt;Account Holder : UNICEF KOREA

&gt;Bank Address :  45, Namdaemunno 4-Ga, Jung-Gu, Seoul 

&gt;(zip code: 100-743)

&gt;UNICEF Address : 60, Seogang-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul, Korea

&gt;PLEASE NOTE, upon your remittance, you must let us know the date of remittance, depositor, amount of donation with currency to flag it under the campaign. 

&gt;We sincerely appreciate for your support to help children from violence. 

&gt;Please feel free to contact us if you have more inquiries.

If you have any trouble donating, you can contact donor@unicef.or.kr.

Please share this information to others who may have wanted to donate but couldn't figure out how! 

(And invite them to join the subreddit while you're at it. ;)

Some of the stuff I picked up on:

- Tae leading the intro. I know a lot of us on this subreddit are betting it will be him doing the Intro for the next comeback, and this part of the performance solidifies our theory.

- There were words flashing on the screen during Tae's part but I'm not sure what they were. Has someone cracked the code?

- At the 1:25 mark, you'll see the group forming what looks like the shape of a heart. Also just noticed now that Hobi didn't have a solo dance part? I wonder how it all ties in with his performance with Jimin and how he was like the ""shadow"".

Anyway, I might be overthinking all of this - I blame all the comeback talk and my excitement of having this as my first. Perhaps something caught your eye during the performance, then please go ahead and fire away! 

**Edit**

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has chimed in so far. I love how we're all excited on the clues and symbolism that BTS has been feeding us, and it's truly intellectually stimulating, getting to read these perspectives. This subreddit is the best. ",66,85,False,self,,,,,

#The 2017 /r/bangtan Awards!  

[](#jh_sun)

The format for this years awards is going to be slightly different from [last years](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/bangtanawards), in that there will be two rounds of voting: the prelims, and the final voting. The prelims will be used to determine the top 5 candidates from each category, who will then go on to the final round of voting to determine the ultimate winners. If, for some reason, there are less than 5 nominees in a category, they wont go on to the finals, and Ill just determine the winner from the prelim votes.  

****

##Eligibility period for nominations: January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017  

##Voting closes on January 21, 2018 (EST (UTC-05), whenever I'm able to log on)  

##PLEASE FOLLOW THE NOMINATION OUTLINE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL VOTING THREAD'S OP!  

****

**Rules for the preliminary vote:**  

1. You may vote for as many nominations as you wish.  
2. DO NOT REPLY TO ANY NOMINATIONS WITHIN THE VOTING THREAD. I will remove any replies I see. If you want to discuss nominations, do it in this thread!  
3. Please give a link/source for any videos and gifs you use in your nominations. Since this thread is going to be archived, its good to know what something was if its removed later on :)  
4. You can nominate as many things in as many categories as you wish. Just make sure it hasn't been nominated already!  
5. Keep checking back throughout the nomination period - you might miss some nominations that were added later on!  
6. [Subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) still apply.

I was like aren't the tracks ready already?? Dude please I can't wait anymore.Also is the love yourself series to continue till 2019, cause I doubt they will release 3 minis this year..

So what do you think after RM's answer? When would it be?Recently they have been busy with the fan meeting. Maybe after that they'll focus on the comeback?

As a Namjoon stan, I've had to do a lot of defending for why I like him so much. I'm hoping the more people who see the big picture of Namjoon's growth and maturity, the less we'll have to keep defending our illustrious leader. It makes me happy to know public sentiment about Namjoon has taken a turn for the better this year, following their international activities.

**1. His Ability to Learn:**

RM has shown that he is open minded enough to learn from and admit his mistakes, in [this interview](http://yasuis.tumblr.com/post/114481085311/interview-150324-hiphopplaya-rap) he says:

 

**Q: You shouted, Westside Till I Die during If I Ruled The World.**

* RM: Thats well I was really wrong then (laughter). After the album came out and I listened to it, I thought Ah. I think I was immersed in the emotions while recording and ended up shouting like that.

**Q: Whats the specific reason why you feel you were wrong?**

* RM: First off, I didnt even live in the 'west side And even if that song had a G-Funk sound, what I shouted wasnt the way to respect the west coast hip-hop musicians. I believe there are many meanings inside the words Westside Till I Die. Sweat, struggles, pride, etc. Isnt it a phrase that compressed all these factors of life.

**Q: Are you saying that you overlooked the weight and complex undertones that the phrase has within hip-hop?**

* RM: Thats right. I believe its different from words like Yo! or Check It!. As a result, I was thoughtless.

**Q: Are you admitting it to be a mistake?**

* **RM: Further than a mistake, it was a wrong. I have nothing to say.**

**2. Respecting Hip-Hop/Black Culture:**

 

 [this April 2015 interview](http://bangtan.tumblr.com/post/114241507544/interview-april-edition-2015-of-singles-rap) that showcase just how much RM has deepened his understanding of the culture:

 

&gt;There are two things that Warren G told me that I will never be able to forget. The first is, hip-hop is open to any one. Despite what your race is or where youre from, hip-hop is a type of music that is always ready to give you space for anyone who enjoys hip-hop. So, dont restrain yourself behind any type of prejudiced thought, and the other one was youre doing well, so no matter what others say, believe in yourself and do what you want.



&gt;Defining hip-hop is the same as trying to define love. If there are 6 billion people in the world, then there are 6 billion definitions of love, and like that, each definition of hip-hop is different for each person. Of course, its possible to give a dictionary definition. In 1970, there was a person called DJ Herc in South Bronx. At a party that he was hosting, he set breaks on a beat and during that break, someone would be rapping, someone would be dancing, and someone else would be doing graffiti Thats how hip-hop was born, and they call that the 4 elements of hip-hop, but dictionary definitions like these is something anyone knows, but to explain that spirit In one word, its something that cant be explained. Its a way that expresses me as well as being a meaning for freedom and rebelling.Because its something where people play and have fun with, it can have messages of peace and love placed in it. If you compare it to a Pokemon, its like a Ditto. Personally, hip-hop to me is the world. The world that Im living in Its difficult, right? To be honest, its still hard for me too.

[[istg namjoon, using a pokemon as a deep metaphor.]]



&gt;The culture of shooting guns and doing drugs is not the actual self of hip-hop. Its just become a by-product that appeared around hip-hop music, its not the actual self of hip-hop. Although theres a certain image that pops up clearly when you think of hip-hop fashion, thats also becoming something thats more broad. Look at A$AP Rocky or Kanye West. They dont wear pants that drag around any more. To understand swag, you need to understand what kind of meaning making it on your own has in hip-hop. Making it on your own is a very cool and important concept in hip-hop. Ill use Jay-Z as an example. Jay-Z was a drug dealer. Hes someone that sold drugs on the rooftop of a very large stadium called Barclays Center, but he succeeded and bought that building. After buying that building, he dressed up in hip-hop and then went up to the rooftop and looked down at that building. Then they took a picture of that and posted it. After seeing that, everyone died. Kya Just how cool is that?

[[side note, when he says everyone died I dont think he meant it literally, but I could be wrong; I didnt translate this so maybe it is literal. But I dont think it is.]]

**3. Apologising and reflecting on past mistakes:**

 

RMs hello 2017 (at 6:40) Namjoon addressed how his mindset in the past has been problematic: 

 

&gt;I had a lot of thoughts. I did, in the beginning. When others talked about me in a criticizing way, rather, when others gave unforgivable feedback, it could be advices. Or criticism. It could be condemnation. When I heard so, I felt like this in the beginning Why? Why?. Because I thought, I have been like this. I thought Ive never caused any trouble or inconvenience to others. Ive never thought that way. Because I studied hard when I was young, I worked hard on music, I performed hard. I liked playing games. Thats what consisted of my life. At school I was an obedient student. I did well at school so teachers liked me. I never fought with classmates and I was around with friends.

 

&gt;Ive never thought that my behaviors or music or words could hurt others, or cause inconvenience to others. Ive never thought that way. As I went through the year 2016 I came to think about that. **My words or behaviors, regardless of my intentions, could cause troubles or hurt others feelings. In the process, I thought I need to hold responsibility for that and I need to think about such things. What I said or did would not be undone.** I thought so. Then I learned how to admit myself. It was hard to admit that I could hurt others feelings. It took a long time. I didnt like to admit that I was wrong. Rather than I was wrong, it was hard to admit that I could hurt others feelings. It was hard to admit because Ive never felt that way.

 

&gt;In the beginning, when I was faced with such criticism, I thought like, Why? I did it for a reason. Now, as I said, I feel much better about my feelings and emotions. **Now, when I hear something about me, even if its a criticism or condemnation, I am able to think about what made them say so. What did I do wrong? What I did caused others to feel uncomfortable? What made them criticize me? I am now able to think like that. For now, I cant talk about what was changed in detail. Still, I may have another chance to talk about later. Anyways, to become a better person, I need to hold responsibility for what I do. I need to change my mindset. I need to change my way of thinking if its wrong. I learned I need to hear from many people. I mean, I came to think like that. Now when I do something, I think, how would people feel about my act?** and then I take action. 

 

&gt;Thats why I was able to release Always. The lyrics are very defensive. I wrote that a year ago when I felt stressed. A year ago, or so. I wrote the lyrics back then. I am now able to release it because I no longer feel that way. Now I feel relaxed.

 

&gt;**Anyways, now or in the future, I want to be an artist that has good influence. I hope my music would help others. So, I decided to go in a better way. My goal for 2017 is to be mature in many ways, including my way of thinking. I want to become a person who thinks more righteously, and make greater music. Those are my goals.**

And then March 2017 he released the Change music video which touches on racism in America and the BLM movement. It gets better  Namjoon was the driving force behind this. Billboard interviewed/wrote about them multiple times and I will cite all three. In this billboard interview:

 

**Q: Speaking of solo songs, Change recently came out. Rap Monster, you and Wale are talking about different-but-similar issues when South Korea and America are both having interesting political times. Did you guys have a chance to discuss your different viewpoints?**

 

* We didnt have the time to get into it deeply, but Im always watching the news about Trump and America; I always watch. When he first suggested a collaboration, I was like, What should we do? We could just do you know, a common hip-hop song, but I wanted to do a little more special. We have our political situation in Korea and the students are very angry. So, I think, if we talked about whats going on, then well have a real special collaboration. I think my guess was right and it became special.

 

Change features Rap Monster, dubbed RM for the release, and Wale trading off verses about societal ills, primarily those currently causing divisiveness in the U.S. With the duo criticizing the alt-right, Twitters ability to kill, racist police and declaring no faith in the government, the unrestrained hip-hop track is one of the most progressive songs yet.. Though most K-pop acts shy away from politicizing their music, or even touching on seemingly controversial topics, the Rap Monster-led K-pop act has addressed politics and cultural issues in their songs on multiple occasions, with a particular focus on youth-related issues such as mental health, bullying and suicide.

**3. Never repeating mistakes**

 

Hes never made the exact same mistake twice. He hasnt called his English black English since that radio interview (other people/MCs might have, but he hasnt to my knowledge). He hasnt used the n-word since that Shinhwa song cover, and he hasnt made any colorist remarks since that big debacle. Hes gotten rid of that awful debut hair, and admitted how silly it was, and hes stopped dressing like a bad imitation of a gangster or thug rapper. Hes grown past it and gotten the message.

**4. Regarding Sexism:**

 

Namjoon, because he is who he is, sought further education met with MOTs eAeon who described their encounter in tweets, translations of which were took from [soompi (2016)](https://www.soompi.com/2016/07/06/mots-eaeon-reveals-btss-rap-monster-dealing-misogyny-controversy/):

 

&gt;1. Recently Namjoon (Rap Monster) and I met privately and had a serious long talk about the issue of misogyny. Namjoon felt shame and guilt because of the controversy and revealed to me that he is distressed and unable to sleep well due to it.

&gt;2. So I said that misogyny is not a label or stigma that cannot be erased, but rather an obstacle in the right path that can exist within anyone. Rather than feeling like its unfair or painful, its a matter of deciding to fix it or not after discovering it within oneself.

&gt;3. I talked about how I am also in the process of continuously fixing myself whenever I discover something I am lacking. Namjoon listened attentively and understood better than other people I have spoken to about similar topics with.

&gt;4. Im glad and relieved after seeing Big Hits statement in Donga Ilbo. Because I think the members and the company are moving toward a proper direction. Whats important is not the past or current location but rather what direction one is moving toward.

 


[Translation Pt 1 of 'Exclusive Interview with BTS ahead of their American Debut' by Kang Dong Chul published on Chosun](https://twitter.com/doyou_bangtan/status/933113811539652608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fonehallyu.com%2Ftopic%2F632452-bts-rm-owning-upto-mistakes%2F)

 

And in another interview quoted by [allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/09/bts-rap-monster-talks-about-women-and-rap-culture), which took place in later 2015 after the mixtapes release:

&gt;The interviewer commented, Some rappers express hip hop by dissing others, demeaning women, or harsh cursing, and Rap Monster revealed his point of view. He said, The hip hop culture can be very open, but if you look at it another way, its a closed culture that only those within it could understand.

 

&gt;Rap Monster continued, The public needs to respect that culture in part, but I think that the demeaning of women needs to be subdued. 

 

Namjoon didnt stop there, he didnt just educate himself and then decide to not make the mistake. He continued to educate himself in his limited free time  in a picture of his room/ryan plushies the book Breaking out of the Man Box can be seen. A summary of the book from amazon as follows:

 

* This book tackles the collective socialization of manhood and provides an in-depth look at the experiences of boys and men. In an effort to understand the many aspects of what it means to be a man, Porter suggests the topic is worthy of being rethought, challenged, and even redefined. This book will help menfathers, husbands, brothers, coworkers, etc.unpack and correct those realities.* 

 

* Breaking Out of the Man Box boldly exposes the connection between male socialization and the quest to end violence against women and girls. Porter provides an honest and transformative experience, empowering men to create a world where men and boys are loving and respectfuland a human race where women and girls are valued and safe. On the heels of national movements and initiatives such as the NFLs NoMore.org, this book provides men with the knowledge and understanding to explore how to create that world.

 

And then on top of that, Namjoon wrote 21st Century Girls, armys fav feminist anthem, and Not Today which mentions the glass ceiling. The glass ceiling is an unofficially acknowledged barrier to advancement in a profession, especially affecting women and members of minorities.

**RM changed the lyrics to some songs for the FINAL concert:**

 

**BTS Cypher PT.3 : KILLER**

* While men smoke cigarettes and women cheat  While some smoke cigarettes and some cheat)

 

-- Above change is most likely due to criticism of misogyny

 

**Born Singer**

* 'sunglasses, hairstyle, I know why you insult me'  'sunglasses, hairstyle, I know why you insulted me'

 

* 'I'm going to be a rap star'  'I'm going to be myself' 

 

** (Spring Day)**

* 'It's all winter here'  'It's all winter there' 

 

-- These seem to reflect the changes RM has gone through, coming to terms with his identity and happiness, and I'm very happy to see that he is able to share that growth in this way.

**5. His Support for LGBT:**

 

He openly supports gay rights. 

 

While listening to the popular LGBTQ anthem song Same Love, by Macklemore, Rap Monster left this tweet alongside it after reading the lyrics: Its Rap Monster. A song about homosexuality. I heard this song before but I didnt know the lyrics, now I know them and I like the song twice as much. I recommend Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis - Same Love. 

And more recently he, in the [vlive chat](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6-SaXzWwAU10oQ.jpg), brought up the french film Blue is the Warmest Color and how much he enjoyed it. For those who dont know, its a movie centered around a lesbian couple.

 

*he also wrote Serendipity with gender neutral pronouns [on purpose](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7966098/bts-love-yourself-her-album-rap-monster-interview-analysis-meaning) to be inclusive (credit to gimmi)
&gt; **Why are BTS lyrics gender neutral in HER?**

* Q: I was reading the lyrics (Serendipity) are gender neutral, which I think is really powerful. Was that a conscious decision? 

* **Namjoon: The lyrics were based on rare and special things in life. So, I thought, those feelings transcend genders, cultures, and barriers between people.**

**Conclusion:**

 

Namjoon was accused of racism. So he educated himself on rap culture. He adjusted his mindset to understand that despite intentions he could still hurt people and never did those things again. He collabed with Wale to make a song that touched on racial issues in America. Namjoon was accused of sexism. He apologized. Then because he felt it was not enough, he met with a feminist and asked questions and learned about his wrong doings. He, in his spare time, bought a book on sexism and educated himself. Then on top of that, he wrote a feminist anthem AND spoke of the glass ceiling in Not Today. I will now add that Namjoon has also, consistently and at his own expense, supported LGBT rights and the general acceptance of mental illness. Since before debut (I cant cite every instance, youll just have to go through all of his discography since theres so many) he has openly shared his own problems with mental illness.

I was confused myself about many of the details when I joined last year, so I thought it would be helpful to gather what information I have in one post to share with/ help out others.

If you're also a fan club member and see something incorrect or want to add something, please let me know and I will edit this post!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**What is the official fan club and how is it different from the fan cafe?**

The [Daum Fan Cafe](http://cafe.daum.net/BANGTAN) is basically a moderated forum for fans of BTS (most kpop groups have a fan cafe on Daum). Anyone can join the cafe for free and level up by completing streaming tasks/answering questions. 

The fan cafe is mostly in Korean, with the exception of the forums created specifically for international fans, and strictly moderated-- you can't violate the rules, including the ban on sharing materials from the fan cafe on other sites, or you will be demoted and/or banned. It is seen as a safe and protected space for ARMY and BTS to interact with each other. (What happens in fan cafe, stays in fan cafe.)

The official fan club, however, is a fee-based membership that BigHit/BTS recruits for once a year. Each year of recruits is called a generation (2017= 4th Generation ARMY, 2018= 5th Generation ARMY). You sign up and pay the very reasonable membership fee to become an official member of that ARMY generation. 

The fan cafe and fan club are two very separate but closely related entities.

**Why should I join the official fan club?**

For one, it's another point of pride for BTS to say they have X number of members in their fan club. But for you personally, you get an official fan club membership card that has your name and fan club ID number on it, which is pretty awesome. I carry mine in my wallet just in case I run into other ARMY and showing it gets people really excited to join the official fan club for next year.

Being an official ARMY member also gets you a lot of perks: 

* Priority access to ticket sales (in Korea, at least)
* First dibs at tickets for that year's/your generation's Muster
* ARMY I designation on the daum fan cafe (provided you're at least level 2 by the end of recruitment) which gives you access to exclusive forums and a message on your birthday (they do everyone for that month at once)
* Opportunity to get tickets to music and awards show broadcasts
* Perks at concerts in Korea (they have official booths for fan club members)
* Presale access for certain items in the BTS official shop
* A swanky official fan club kit that is different every year

When the recruitment is ongoing, certain lucky people who sign up also get bonus materials. For example, in 2017, the 13,613th member received a BTS polaroid group photo.

Unfortunately, I've never been able to make use of many of these perks because I don't speak Korean or live in Korea. (If anyone has info on how to get presale access in the shop, please hmu!)

Please note the presale access for tickets currently only applies to events in Korea. 

**When is enrollment for the BTS fan club?**

They will announce the recruitment for this year's ARMY generation on their Twitter and Facebook when it opens, and usually [there is a video too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRR7YwdtNCs). 

Enrollment is open for 2-3 weeks, and happens about 12 months after the previous year's recruitment. This is so ARMY can get a full year's worth of the perks. 2017 4th ARMY recruitment was May 8- May 25 and there was such a big response they ended up doing a second recruitment period. So 2018 recruitment might happen sometime in May/June? 

**How do I join the official BTS fan club?**

In 2017, instructions were also provided in English, which was a god-send. The membership is sold like it is a ticket, through Interpark, a ticketing service (like a Korean Ticketmaster if you are from the US). They will provide the link when they announce recruitment, but you can also go to Interpark and search for it once it's open.

You need to have an Interpark account to buy the membership (but it's free to sign up and you can use an international credit card when you make your purchase).

When you purchase the fanclub membership, be sure the name you provide matches the name on your passport. If you ever are lucky enough to go to a concert or muster in Korea, you need to show ID that matches your fanclub membership card to receive the fanclub benefits.

After you complete your purchase on Interpark, you must go back into your ""event"" purchase and provide information about your Name, Birthday, Daum cafe ID, and I think I had to provide my ID for the official BTS store as well. This is so they can apply the perks. I think many people forget to do this step. If you forget, they put your Interpark login info on your card and you won't get any of the online perks.

**What are the levels on the fan cafe and what do they mean?**

The highest regular level I've seen is 3. 
When you join the cafe, you'll be level one. You must become at least level 2 to get access to the boards and have the ability to post on them. 

There are also special designations ARMY I and ARMY II that are only available to people who purchase the fan club membership. They give you access to certain official fan club areas of the fan cafe. 

The levels are denoted by a little briefcase that appears to the left of a user name. Regular levels have a white fill. Those with the ARMY designation will have a color fill (green for level 2, blue for level 3)

**How do I level up on the fan cafe?**

You can level up by completing the weekly level up tasks, which involve answering questions that change each week and showing proof you streamed their current single on a music site and on Youtube. 

Translating the questions can be difficult, especially since fan cafe rules prohibit posting content outside the cafe (requesting a translation for example). Providing proof of streaming can also be a stumbling block for iARMY. If you are having trouble getting a service like Melon or Naver on your phone, note that /u/myystikspiral was able to level up using Google Play Music and Apple Music on Andriod.

[This is a good tutorial on how to level up.](https://radiantwings09.wordpress.com/2017/06/11/how-to-level-up-in-bts-fancafe/)

You can apply to level up each weekend from Friday - Sunday 11:59pm KST and it can take 2-3 weeks for them to process your application to level up. Anyone can do this, whether they pay for a fan club membership or not.

**How I get the special ARMY I and ARMY II designations on the fan cafe?**

If you are at least level 2 when your fan club membership is applied (by the end of the recruitment period) you'll automatically get the ARMY I designation.

Think of it like becoming level 2 on the board unlocks the ability to apply the ARMY designations.

If you're not level 2 by the time membership recruitment ends, then you have to first become level 2 and then answer more questions on another board to get the ARMY I designation.

In previous years, you could be level 1 on the cafe (brand new account) and get automatically bumped up to level 2 when you buy the fan club membership *and* get the ARMY I applied. This past year, you needed to already be level 2 to get bumped up to ARMY I. I fucked this up because I thought the promotion was still automatic, and have been kicking myself since.

To become an ARMY II, you have to achieve ARMY I and then show more evidence that you have purchased albums, songs, etc on a different board.

**How much does it cost to join the ARMY fan club?**

In 2017, the membership fee was 25,000 KRW (so around $23 USD). You have to pay for shipping of the fan club kit, which was $50 in 2017 (ouch).

 **How long does BTS fan club membership last?**

Membership lasts for 1 year. At the end of the year, you lose those perks, including being bumped from ARMY I on the fan cafe back down to your regular level. So if you were level 2 before you bought your membership, you'll be regular old level 2 again.

Every year you must buy a new membership if you want to remain a member of the official fan club and get access to that year's perks and special boards on the daum fan cafe. Every year when you buy a membership you will get a new membership kit and membership card.

 **What kinds of materials do you get in the ARMY membership kit?**

 The materials are different for each generation, and members are not supposed to share photos and other information about what materials they receive on the internet. You can find unboxing videos of what each generation received, but from what I understand, that's violating the terms of membership and can get your membership revoked.

If anyone has other questions, please feel free to ask. and I'll share what I know. The sub's official Discord is another good place to get information. There are other members of this sub who have been in the fanclub much longer than I have. ARMY sunbaes, please share if you have another tip or information people would find valuable and I'll add it to the post!

The extensive [subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index) and [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faq) also have a lot of information on questions like this and are wonderful resources!

371,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2018-1-14,2018,1,14,5,7q70p0,self.bangtan,The Musical/Real Evolution of Bangtan,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7q70p0/the_musicalreal_evolution_of_bangtan/,AirConditioner10,1515875535,"Ive been listening to their music since the first album and I heard I Like it, and coming into 2018 and seeing where they are... the evolution into where they are now is quite fascinating and a great piece for anyone, Bangtan fans or not, to look up and read. Please be ready, this is a long ass rant Im typing in bed and just trying to make sure all my thoughts are in here.

I think my favorite thing about this group is everything feels themed appropriately to the stages of life. Also, the shift of genre has changed I think in the best way possible.

1. First we have the trilogy of them representative as school, and at this point majority of their music is heavily rap influenced. They were still hardcore hip hop and trying to label themselves as that. It falls in line perfectly as they are still high schoolers, finding their place in real life too. Mentally, Ive read Rap Monster and Suga werent necessarily happy with their positions as idols cause they thought they were joining hip hop groups. As high school, you think youre set to a label and want to be associated to only one group. Ironically, the members were trying to figure that out too in real life.

2. Then moving onto Dark and Wild, its the moment between leaving high school and going into young adult/college. But youve barely lived life still. Their music is starting to experiment more with other genres, and it was a bit confusing in their own right trying to find their place in music and theirselves. I know this is the albums title War on Hormone caused a bit of lyric controversy for being misogynist, and reflective of their music persona and real life theyre learning hard lessons for the first time.

3. HwaYangYeonHwa trilogy, this is when you realize that life is beautiful and their music is becoming a true and honest reflection of becoming adults. More members are coming into their own, and this is the point imo where Rap Monster and Suga are starting to pick up footing and be comfortable with themselves. Its the trilogy that shows the band, life is complicated and filled with all kinds of things. You see the progression of their mindset change. Its starting to play to peoples strengths. Growing as individuals, all the members are starting to be a little happier with themselves (life is a process of course, but to me the group is feeling freer during 2016). I credit this era to coming out with what I think the turning point of this group was: Burning Up/Fire. In all my time watching this band, this is the first time I felt the group was truly happy. 

4. The Wings album, the solo songs, more learnings. The Outro for Wings imo is a song about acceptance and using it to fly. The group is experimenting genres because its no longer about the hip hop genre, but playing with other perspectives is what helps the group evolve musically. And you see the group as writers start to understand their music is strongest when theyre trying to do everything. Everyone is writing songs, the young Jungkook is starting to get really into recording, Jimin participating and becoming a well rounded person as a singer, dancer, songwriter, variety. The group as a whole is becoming more confident as musicians and as people, and god bless Awake for Jins coming out. Fire really helped, but this song was a game changer for him. V is doing exactly what he wanted, a Jazz R&amp;B Song. Also, acknowledged in Blood Swear Tears, Jhope has always been an incredible presence in the band with his additional songwriting and stage presence, but imo this is his blossoming into being a Center and being more recognized. Jhope is being given more trust in the band to carry the group.

5. 2017, the realization that in life you can have it all if you wanted to as long as you work and try. Yeah yeah, billboard, GDA, we all know that, but this musically is year is the stride. I see Rap Monster and Suga truly caring about the group as a whole with the different focuses in music and providing members with even bigger opportunities (giving V the DNA intro, and Jin the mid-prechorus of DNA and ending of Mic Drop. Also DNA probably one of the most kpop sounding songs they ever had), embracing their idol sound, but finally creating a hip hop and rap identity that is their own flavor (mixtapes from 2015 and 2016, Not Today, Outro: Her, Mic Drop). And BTS as adults, they acknowledge their ultimate and realized goal: they want their music to impact the people who listen to it. Whether its domestically or internationally, its about writing music for themselves, for others. Its no longer about just a hip hop genre although that is where they are rooted. Music is a universal language.

Another thing I want to recognize is Love Yourself: Her and how it coincides with the band and their following. The group is getting a bigger fan base than ever with this mini, and ironically this is also the album where theyre scared and coming to terms with their fan base. Its the first time in lyrics BTS has shown vulnerability to their fans as being the ones that brought them sucess they are today, but freely admitting that a part of them is masked because they care about the fans so much. Aside from interviews with other idols, who has ever written that in song form? This is incredibly powerful, because BTS coming into their mid-20s, admitting they want their own lives too and hope they will eventually understand. BTS is realizing what idol life has caused, and to make the next chapter of their music easy on themselves and their fans, they want to ensure they are studying for their tests and becoming humans outside of dependency of musical artists. They understand their young fans of course are in a time where theyre obsessed with celebrities, but they want to make sure their priorities are straight. This album is setting a precedent for their next chapter as musicians and their lives.


This now leads to 2018 and whatever the next trilogy or album becomes. Theyre in an international position now, group is strongest as ever, but also theyre trying to live their life with the throes of stardom. This is what I feel the future holds:
- Proudness of individual identity. Solo activities for everybody, more OSTs for the vocal line, mixtapes galore for rap line, collabs with many Korean artists
- Jungkook and JHope, were going to start seeing those 2 compose more things. The rise of Jungkook is coming, and not just in his typical Golden Maknae self, but he will write more music
- What is approaching 30s like? Were going to see a mini album about falling in love with a person and heartbreak. Alongside their fans, they wont just be writing about themselves but fans who are also now starting to date. It would not surprise me if one of their future songs will talk about being scared of joining the army and leaving for 2 years, and to be honest I would love to see something like that happen. 


TLDR: BTS is still evolving into its ultimate form, get ready to be Jungshook.",19,135,False,self,,,,,

Bonus question: what about another member made him your bias wrecker? 

Personally, I love them all and Im OT7 through and through, but Taehyung in particular just takes up a slightly bigger chunk in my heart space (and camera roll)! I was falling into the rabbit hole hard and fast, but the moments where I literally felt my heart ache a little were: 

1.  That video where hes playing with his little cousins
2. [This MPD Taehyung fancam from when they performed 21st Century Girl](https://youtu.be/FvYr3lmM7Fk) 
3. That VLIVE where he talks about his friend who deliberately gave him the wrong address to a birthday party, eats TWO burgers, tries on another shirt he just bought, and recommends some 50s-60s music that were already in my top 25 most played. Musical soulmate is a life soulmate, yall. 
4. That Bangtan Bomb where he raps Cypher. Hes so unapologetically himself no matter what he does, and legit doesnt care what people think.
5. That Tae fanmeeting fancam when he tells a fan shes got lipstick on her teeth and she gets embarrassed, so he uses his hand to cover her mouth so she can remove it without feeling shy


As for my bias wrecker, its really difficult to choose but recently, its been none other than Hoseok. His [dance practice for Boy Meets Evil](https://youtu.be/f-CTTl3D5LM) made me appreciate how hard he works. Hes a natural onstage for sure, but he never just relies on talent and always puts in the blood, sweat, and tears, heh.

Since the news of the VLive app released allowing people to stream content via other outlets than mobile now, I decided Id like to spread the love and do a personal VLive coin giveaway. 

~~TWO~~ **FOUR** winners will each get $20 (USD) in PayPal cash so you can buy coins in the store and watch whatever your heart desires. This would be more than enough to buy about 800 coins and then some. Since there is no way to actually gift coins I can only offer money via PayPal so please make sure you are able to accept it if you are the chosen winner(s). 

All you guys have to do is post ONE favorite picture of the group or any single member. I will choose winners through a random draw. 

**Deadline**: Thursday January 18th at 7 pm EST. 

Good luck! 

**EDIT #1**: Thanks to the generosity of /u/Caledonia_Plaid, she has graciously added an extra $40 to the giveaway so we could have four winners instead of an original two that were posted. *Thank you so much! &lt;3*

Ok so when you sample a song, you paid the original owner of that song to get permission to use the sample in your own song right? My question is: does the sample part cover the entire original song or just a short part in it? Because a lot of bts songs that I know and love used samples and Im a bit...I dont know...stunned (?)...that those arent their original bts-made sounds. I was proud that bts was able to produce such amazing sounds but turns out they sampled it...which its fine too. But if they only sample a small part and the rest they compose it to their own liking then Im all for it. This may sound like a weird/rude question but I really wanna know. 

Also, does anyone know the whole list of songs that bts have sampled?

Like said in the title I need explanations! I can't seem to find a website where they link everything with the right order, I mean of EVERYTHING. Including the notes of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life. And I don't know if I got this right or not but it's first HYYH and then Wings and then it's Love Yourself, right (with the timeline of the stories)? Are they connected? Cause they seem so and I hear people saying that it's not and that we got an closure for HYYH. Link me stuff please and explanations, cause the notes of HYYH/The Most Beautiful Moment in Life confused me more (didn't pay much of the timeline on the notes, maybe I should?).

&amp;nbsp;

It's very appreciated if you could help in any way, like a map of everything because I'm a relative new ARMY and I just got into all this today and I've been sitting for hours trying not to miss anything and watching everything in the right order but more and more things seem to come up which is getting me more and more confused. Is there an official explanation to any parts or is most of it theories. What I like to do is watch/reading everything and THEN reading theories. Today everything just got mixed between theories and the facts.

&amp;nbsp;

My brain is all mooshi now so I'm just gonna leave this here and go to sleep, hopefully some of you ARMY's can help me out, thanks in advance!

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: I'm glad that this thread is helping other new ARMY's and I hope this will be as useful as it was for me!  Made it more easy to read too, hopefully it's more easy to they eye. HWAITING ()!

Whether the hate is from other fandoms, the general public, friends &amp; family, within our fandom, etc.?

By ""on a personal level,"" I mean how to handle the effect of it on yourself. I don't mean how to respond outwardly to the hate because that can be a topic in itself, and I'm sure that we'll always have trolls, haters, drama, etc.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but after the initial burst of rage, I just get really depressed/stressed/sad. I still love BTS/ARMY so much, but my positive feelings are now mixed up and muted with anger/sadness/bitterness.

So I bought a Chimmy standing doll from Line NYC with the intent of displaying it in my office, before realizing there was a decent chance of it being stolen. I don't really want it at home when I have plushes already, and I figured with the stock issues lately there was a decent chance someone here was looking for this. It's still in the box, never been opened.

Not looking to make a profit, just reimbursement. With tax the doll was about $36, so if you're interested the price is **$36 USD + shipping and PayPal fee**. I don't have bubble wrap on hand but will get it if you comp probably like $1-2 extra - otherwise it's whatever padding I can find around the house. 

US or Canada recipients would be preferred. Please comment or message if interested, and we can get further into the details. :)

I'm preparing for my english presentation on BTS' ""Spring Day""... I want to analyse the lyrics and together with the class I want to analyse the video, like different facial emotions, scenes etc. 
I also wanna talk about different possible theories that were mad up by the fans. 

As I'm working on this presentation, I hope I can get the same amazing help from you guys I got on my last post, where I asked for opinions on which song to analyse, which led up to me choosing 'Spring Day', of course. :)

#Theres a reason for BTS being a Global Trend You're saying these types of songs are considered idol music?    
^source: ^http://www.joongdo.co.kr/main/view.php?key=20180119010007828      
^translation: ^u/grk637    
 

Five years after their debut, BTS, who couldnt find a lot of love from the general public because of idol-bias, has experienced a miracle where outside of Korea, Asia, North America the whole world has been colored by music only BTS can make.    
.  
Challenging Korean pop music since pre debut with 100% real hip hop by putting out mixtape pre debut, they told stories from their own worlds [POV], stories that anyone regular person could relate to. In addition, with subjects such as dreams, happiness, self-love continuously talking about problems in society, theyve become artists that have captured students and youths (goes without saying) and even middle aged listeners, differentiating them from many other idols out there.    
.    
The songs below will concretely spotlight how BTS, who has captured the current generation and has raised [Korean] national prestige abroad and become such global trends.    

.

**1. [Pied Piper [LOVE YOURSELF  Her]](https://youtu.be/MWaAUThfqqQ)**    
A disco based synth funk song with the subject of Pied Piper, the song stands out for its lyrics that are honest/frank and full of individuality. With songwriter [JINBO](https://youtu.be/nnn4E64EJ-M) contributing to a global [sounding] melody, [DJ SHAUN](https://youtu.be/PhiYyAC63zk) (of '[The Koxx](https://youtu.be/CYjg9S7A18k)') on guitar and [Nahzam Sue](https://youtu.be/hCGX8RAql3I) (of [Sultan of the Disco](https://youtu.be/xK2VuLwEX0s)') on Talk Box, the beat and completeness of the song reaches a higher level.   
 
.  
  
**2. [Save ME [HYYH: Young Forever]  ](https://youtu.be/GZjt_sA2eso)**    
A song that stands out for the use of Tropical House (popular in the club scene worldwide) with a hint of Future Bass, combined with emotive vocals specific to BTS and a refreshing sound. With a lyrical melody as a base, the lyrics in the chorus section elicits an enormous amount of relatablity as it relays the feeling of restless youths stuck in a grim reality.

.

**3. [21st Century Girl [WINGS]](https://youtu.be/r-jZYgAXSeM)**    
It is a powerful hip hop song that harks back to BTSs early sound. It carries a positive message for all of us that live in the 21st century, that we are all people who are beautiful, precious and have the right to be loved. Due in part to each section carrying a different type of sound, the listener feels a sense of speed through the entire runtime.",15,109,False,self,,,,,

Please make sure to take a look at and [vote in the /r/bangtan awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7pqbo2/rbangtan_awards_2017_preliminary_voting_is_open/) if you haven't already! All the information is in the linked post. Even if you have voted, but haven't checked back recently, make sure to go back to check for any new nominations that might have been added since you last looked!  

The top 5 nominees in each category will go on to the finals, so the final round will be opening soon (tm) after it closes tomorrow. You'll know when voting is closed because I'll set the voting subreddit to private, and you won't be able to see any of the voting pages anymore haha.  

Let's get out the vote! Feel free to campaign in this thread...

I'm passing this request by K-ARMYs. 

&amp;nbsp;

BTS is nominated for K-Wave Popularity Award at the 27th Seoul Music Awards, and the winner is chosen solely based on fan votes. If we win this award, it's going to be the first fan-voted popularity award for BTS. The voting runs until Jan 22, 23:59 pm KST. 

You need to download an app to vote. They are three versions, but K-Wave Popularity category is only available on their 'global' app. Download the app here: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sportsseoul.smaglobal), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/27th-sma-voting-app-for-global/id1318088896?mt=8).

One shitty thing (let alone the fact that you have to download an app and create an account) is that you need to earn/buy 'points' to vote. You can vote 10 times per day, and each vote requires 100 points. You can watch videos, play games, or take surveys to earn points, or just buy 1000 points at $1. K-ARMYs have been raising fund to purchase and donate points to those with multiple accounts and time to vote, so you might also find them on Twitter and ask for points.

&amp;nbsp;

Click here to see the current voting results: http://seoulmusicawards.com/vote/rank/a1

For a detailed guide, please refer to https://btsanalytics.tumblr.com/post/168440049438/bts-sma-gda-voting

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 1: It's a back-and-forth battle again. We're either winning or losing by an extremely small margin. Please go vote! Don't forget it's the K-Wave category that we are focusing on.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 2: We have less than one full day left and are currently losing. Another way to help with the voting is to donate accounts. Here's how to donate your account(s).

* Download the SMA global app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sportsseoul.smaglobal), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/27th-sma-voting-app-for-global/id1318088896?mt=8))

* Create an account. You don't need to charge points. Do NOT vote with the account. 

* DM [@doolsetbangtan](https://twitter.com/doolsetbangtan) your account information.

* Create and donate as many accounts as you can. ",21,80,False,self,,,,,

Preliminary voting for the 2017 /r/bangtan Awards closed earlier today, and since I'm a monster with too much free time on my hands, I've already prepared the final voting form. A few quick things before I link it:  

1. The formatting is a little strange because you can't embed links into the words on Google Forms like you can on Reddit, which made bringing some of the nominees over here tricky. I did my best to keep them as similar as possible! 
* I've linked any corresponding videos/pictures/etc you need to know for the nominees **below** the poll. Google forms only allows me to directly embed a Youtube video, so any other form of media (Vlive, Dailymotion, etc) has its own section at the very bottom with just a link. It looks kinda weird, but it's the best I can do!  
* Each category has its own page, which is why it says ""19 pages,"" don't be scared :P (there's only 1 poll per page)
* I've split the ""Best Vlive"" category into two parts: ""Variety series"" and ""unscripted"". If I didn't, all of the top 5 nominees would have been a Run! BTS or BTS Gayo episode, and diversity is a good thing to have!   
* FYI, none of these nominees are listed in any particular order; it mostly had to do with which nominations had a Youtube video that I could easily embed with it. 
* I'm not gonna require signing in to vote, but **please don't vote multiple times.** These awards are just for fun, don't make it something I have to regulate please please please :(  
* Similarly, please don't share this outside of the subreddit, as this is intended to just be a fun thing for the /r/bangtan community to do together :)  

##Voting will be open until January 29, EST (UTC -5), whenever I'm able to log on.

So as a huge fan of BTS and Kpop in general, I wanted to find an article about bts and breaking language barriers through music in America.

&amp;nbsp;

As you may know, [J-HOPE and SUGA^(aka Agust D)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQacWrfUMAAKPxS.jpg) are celebrating their birthdays this February 18th and March 9th, respectively! We'll be running both birthday projects at the same time, so for easier reference, we're combining the announcements in this post.

For our skim readers, we have bolded the main points and included a TL;DR at the bottom :)

##ANNOUNCEMENT

**First, an important announcement.**

Due to nearly missing a few submissions (email filters messing up/marking messages as spam), **we will be phasing out email submissions for the birthday projects**. The BTS Projects Team has created a form through Google Script which will allow photo and message submissions. Google will prompt you with our email, (r.bangtanprojects@gmail.com) and will ask if you know us. In order to access the submission forms, click 'Trust App'. We promise we did not code anything malicious. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now that's cleared up, here are the birthday projects!

As BTS shares hope and inspiration in their message, we wanted to do projects this year that would reflect this for each member.

&amp;nbsp;

**J-HOPE's Birthday Project theme: Sunshine!**

We encourage you to send in any art, photos, words, moments, or events that add a little sunshine in your life! These things may or may not be related to J-Hope/BTS (i.e. they could be personal things that cheer you up).

&amp;nbsp;

**SUGA's Birthday Project theme: Dreams**.

If you have art, photos, words, moments, or events that have inspired you to keep dreaming, please send them in! Again, these things may or may not be related to Suga/BTS (i.e. they could be personal things that inspire you to dream).

&amp;nbsp;

As with all other projects, **the theme is optional; we will still accept normal fan letters and fan art** that has been done for each birthday so far. 

##[**J-HOPE'S BIRTHDAY SUBMISSIONS FORM**](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxA5KbHz9GWLpu8jzChTV8Pg648bd_lJu4OyjJNfLClpfeUzAI/exec)

##[**SUGA'S BIRTHDAY SUBMISSIONS FORM**](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwirlEEGqIs9YZKW6blul1Z_ovYJHeXN3qEpWWEunUVQMxX63I/exec)

Send in your entries through the forms linked above (only the message and credit fields are required). **After clicking 'Submit', please wait for the confirmation screen to appear to ensure that your submission is properly saved.**

&amp;nbsp;

##GUIDELINES


**MESSAGE SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - Please limit your message to **&lt;1250 characters** (about 250 words).
&gt;
&gt; - No inappropriate messages. **Your message CANNOT contain anything inappropriate or any sexual content - we will remove your submission without warning if it violates this rule**. Examples of inappropriate content include but are not limited to the following: any references to: sex, BTS/nonBTS pairings/couples, self-harm, criticism directed to the members' parents/family/friends, 'stalkery' tendencies, including your personal information such as phone/email/address/etc.
&gt; 
&gt; - Please also **proofread your messages before submission** to maximize our time compiling the entries. We may also edit entries for spelling and grammar (no other edits will be made). If you leave your contact details below, we will contact you regarding any changes made.
&gt;
&gt; - Please include **ONE message per submission** using the submission form(s) linked above. If you would like to send more than one message, please use the submission form again for each new message.
&gt;
&gt; - You can send a handwritten letter as long as it's legible and follows the rest of the photo submission guidelines below.


**FAN ART / PHOTO SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - Please include **self created** artworks and photographs only.
&gt;
&gt; - We are **accepting all types of media** (hand-drawn, digital media, photographs etc.). If hand drawn or a non-digital piece, please **scan or photograph your work clearly** to ensure it prints well.
&gt;
&gt; - We recommend that the files should have a resolution of **at least 300 dpi** (if you are unsure of the size of your image, make sure one side is at least 1000 pixels). This goes for photos, and digital or scanned fan art.
&gt;
&gt; - **JPG or PNG** files are acceptable. If you have a question about submitting other formats, please PM us.
&gt;
&gt; - 8 x 10 in (about 20 x 25 cm) is the envisaged size of the pages, but you may submit any artwork or photograph up to the size of this space. The **print safe zone is about around 18 x 24 cm (7.1 x 9.5 in)**. For handwritten messages in particular, we strongly suggest you write your message well within this print safe zone.
&gt;
&gt; - You are allowed **3 photos per submission**. If you would like to submit more, please use the submission form(s) linked below again for each new batch (3) of photos.

&amp;nbsp;


##CHARITY

We will be donating to the [BTS+UNICEF: Love Myself campaign](http://www.unicef.or.kr/donation/en/index.asp) for our charity component of both projects. Remember, this is our birthday gift to the members as a sub. We can't send them gifts, or bring a cake to them in person, but we can support charities the members feel passionate about.

In case you might have missed the announcement, [UNICEF has now opened and is accepting international donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7pp7q5/love_myself_campaign_launches_page_for/) as of January the 9th.  **With that, we'd like to give you guys a couple of options:**

**DONATIONS THROUGH THE u/BTSProjects TEAM **

&gt; You can send us your charity donations [through our PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please, don't forget to specify *username | Charity | cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name* in the comment section of the transaction. This is so the fund is put solely towards the charity donation.

**INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS **

&gt; If you would prefer to donate directly to the LOVE MYSELF campaign, but would like your donation to count under our subreddit's running total, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYzsA-58zbKmBm1B8B7sdyM1adGfRjq3jBvNf1OMXnvzr_VA/viewform?usp=sf_link) after donating. We will include you in the books' donation credits as well.

It used to be that you had to have a Korean ID to donate to the BTS campaign, and that's why we, the Projects Team, had decided to donate on the sub's behalf (we got friends in high places, y'all ^(*winks*) lol). Because international donations are now open, whether you decide to pool in and donate with us, or if you want to donate by yourself, that is fine. The important thing is that we help and donate.

Charity donations for both projects close [**February 15 at 11:59 pm US CST**](https://i.imgur.com/v2mzoMe.png).

&amp;nbsp;

##DEADLINES + OTHER INFO

In order to compile, print, ship, and deliver the books on time **submissions for both projects will close at 11:59 pm US CST on 3rd FEBRUARY**. For those of you in [Europe, Australia, and North America here's what the deadline translates to your time zone](https://i.imgur.com/qQvNZLV.png). We're sorry we can't include each and every time zone, we tried to cover the ones where we have more redditors, but if we didn't cover your time zone you can use this [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to find out the exact date and time submissions close for you. Remember to be timely with your submissions, since we will busy compiling the entries for both project simultaneously and we will most likely not have time to accommodate late submissions. If you need to set multiple reminders for yourself, you can do one (or all) of the following:

- Comment *RemindMe! 10 days* under this post, to be reminded roughly a week before deadline. You can also do this for [any number of days before the deadline, e.g. RemindMe! 5 days or RemindMe! 12 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/2862bd/remindmebot_date_options/). 

- [View our localendar](https://www.localendar.com/public/r_bangtan) for deadline info; you can subscribe to events to be contacted about deadlines. 

- [Follow us](https://mobile.twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) on Twitter! And, make sure to enable notifications for us, so you can receive updates.

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding costs, our coordinators will try to cover all costs and expenses so as many of you guys can participate. However, because life happens, this time around it has been a little more difficult for us to find the funds to cover these two projects. So, if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping, you can send us a little sum'in sum'in [here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Any help would be greatly appreciated!! If you are sending us money to cover expenses, please [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and don't forget to specify *username | JH Project | cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name* in the comment section of the transaction, like so:

&gt; - *u/BTSProjects | P+S | cr: r/bangtan's coordinoonas* to help us cover printing and shipping for both books (since we will be ordering and shipping them together)
&gt;
&gt; **OR:**
&gt;
&gt; - *u/BTSProjects | Charity 50:50 P+S | cr: r/bangtan's coordinoonas* if you want to split your contribution in half for both the charity and printing costs

We want to be responsible with your money, and allocate it to the appropriate project, so please don't forget! You can change the percentages as you prefer (if the percentages are confusing, you can just specify the amount, e.g. ""$5 for charity and $5 for printing and shipping"" in the middle section). To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations. Also, if any money set aside for covering printing and shipping costs remain after the book has been ordered, we will put the remaining balance towards the charity donation.

&amp;nbsp;

##TL;DR

This is a VERY brief summary for the post above. For more thorough details, please refer to the appropriate section(s) typed above.

&gt; - **Announcement:** We are using one form (via Google Script) per member for message &amp; photo/fanart submissions. We will not be accepting email submissions unless absolutely necessary.
&gt;
&gt; - ALL messages should be kept under 1250 characters (about 250 words). Handwritten messages should be legible, and clearly scanned (see photo guidelines).
&gt;
&gt; - You can upload 3 photos per submission.
&gt;
&gt; - Submit all entries for the [J-HOPE project using this form](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxA5KbHz9GWLpu8jzChTV8Pg648bd_lJu4OyjJNfLClpfeUzAI/exec).
&gt; 
&gt; - Submit all entries for the [SUGA project using this form](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwirlEEGqIs9YZKW6blul1Z_ovYJHeXN3qEpWWEunUVQMxX63I/exec).
&gt; - Submissions for both projects close [Feb. 3rd at midnight US CST](https://i.imgur.com/qQvNZLV.png).
&gt;
&gt; - Charity: BTS+UNICEF Love Yourself campaign for both projects. Donations will be done together and close [Feb. 15 at midnight US CST](https://i.imgur.com/v2mzoMe.png).
&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Whew! Thank you for reading. We hope the guidelines weren't too confusing; however, if something wasn't clear enough or if you still have a question about anything regarding the projects, please feel free to PM us!

Alrighty, we will eagerly be expecting your submissions! 

Sincerely, 

The BTS Projects Team

Today I have to finish my presentation on Spring Day by BTS! I posted the text below in a different thread, but no one seemed to respond. So I'm trying a new thread in hopes of someone helping me! Thank you!

This is the first thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7rcvjs/english_presentation_on_bts_spring_day_i_need/

I've gathered A LOT of information about the theories revolving around the music video. After knowing all of this, it truly breaks my heart.

Now my struggle is analysing the lyrics. I do get the parts where the lyrics reference tothe snowpiercer and the Sewol Tragedy.

But I dont get the rest... I also want to analyse the lyrics itself. Give my own interpretation of the lyrics without referring to the theories.

I know the song is about missing someone who is distanced from us (be it the distance or maybe a dead person"". But as beautiful as the lyrics are, I just dont get the ""Spring... Winter... Snowflakes... Spring"" parts... ""It's winter even in August"" as an example?

Maybe someone can help me here.",11,27,False,self,,,,,

Usually people give me an odd look when I talk about doing this with songs BUT

**Does anyone have any random *little* parts of BTS songs they like? Not entire verses and nothing to do with lyrical meaning but just a small part here or there - a word or two, a small line - that you enjoy just for the way it *SOUNDS*?**

For example, the way a certain member sings a particular word or line: their pronunciation, the inflection or stress on a certain vowel, a rapid change in pitch/notes, even non-word sounds (think the HMMmmm hum Ed Sheeran makes in the beginning of [Bloodstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIJHg1XWR7o)), etc etc?

For me, some I love are: 

- The way J-Hope says ""cypher"" in the first line of verse 2 in *Cypher pt.3* 
- In *Converse High* Jungkook saying ""really really. Also Suga saying ""ConvERse convERse I really hate converse, specifically the inflection on that ER.
- In *Best of Me* Jimin saying ""yeongweoneul malhaejwo"" and his inflection on the letter O in the next line when he sings one mOre time. 
- In *Intro: Serendipity*, ""Naye cheonsA naye sesAng,"" the way Jimin's voice vibrates/holds the A. Same with the O during Love me now, Touch me now.    
-  In *Intro: Boy Meets Evil*, Hobi saying ""too bad"" (holding that A) then transitioning into his more blunt/quick delivery of next line specifically when he says ""evil.       
- In *If I Ruled the World*, I like the way Tae says world like, ""Wuuuhhrld""    
- In Reflection ""i Wish i Could Love Myself"" those first letters always sounds more emphasized to my ears? I think it makes this line hit even deeper. I might be crazy and hearing things though lol
- And lastly, **my favorite,** dont think I can post this one here but if you search Jimin, Jin, V acoustic version on youtube youll easily find it. At the end of *I Need U* the oh nananas (idk how to translate that sound lol) Jimin sings are BEAUTIFUL: soft and delicate, yet intimate. If youre looking at the top hit on youtube with 2mil+ views its the part at 3:25 and even more so at 3:45 to 4:00. 

Anyways, these are little parts I find myself rewinding just to hear again. They only comprise mere seconds but manage to alter my impressions of the song. I could list more examples (SO many in Butterfly) but Ive already typed an unnecessary amount lol.     

Please tell me someone else interacts with songs like this and also has examples? and sorry in advance I made no sense...

**Edit: ahhh! I didn't expect such a big response, I'm not alone in the world with my quirks ;_; I knew ARMY would be my people**

Edit 2: misattributed a lyric to Hobi that was actually Yoongi's, sorry swag master. Also it's actually Hobi saying ""Too bad but its too sweet,"" in Boy Meets Evil not JK like I thought",188,105,False,self,,,,,

First, I should disclose that I'm Korean-American and of course a long-time fan of BTS. While I'm mostly culturally American I do find that it's a very good thing Kpop is getting recognized in the States primarily through BTS, and that Asian stereotypes (that we cannot sing or dance) are slowly being broken down. I've always seen and thought of BTS's success as not only a success of BTS and/or Korea, but a success for all Asians, minorities and the millennial generation. But it seems many don't see it that way, and many more are bitter towards the fact that only Kpop (namely BTS) is being recognized in the States, and not other Asian pop's, such as Chinese pop, Vietnamese Pop, Japanese Pop, etc.

Over the last few years, with the rise of Kpop, I've been experiencing some truly negative things in my real life, mostly in terms of verbal assaults (sometimes alienation from peers) from people who're usually other ASIAN-AMERICANS and who've grown to be very hateful towards BTS, Kpop and everything Korea in general. 

To give an example, before the rise of Kpop and esp. BTS, no one cared I'm of Korean descent and was automatically labeled as a ""Chinese"". Now people see that I'm Korean, and while there are some genuinely friendly people, many times I get hateful comments such as ""did all your Korean family members get plastic surgery too?"" and ""why does your culture like girly-looking men so much?"" ""Koreans are the worst copy-cat Asians"". ""Koreans will never be better than [insert other ethnicity]"". Of course I recognize there's music other than Kpop that may be better, and there are some bad Koreans in the world, but seriously are we all just ""copy-cats""?

Am I alone in experiencing this? This has been the single most difficult thing being an ARMY all these years and I would like to get some feedback on how to handle the situation better. Thanks.

EDIT: I do realize a lot of us on here are of Asian descent, so please don't take my post to mean I want to create some unnecessary tension or friction between different Asian communities. I'm just speaking of my own experience, and my own problems related to that. Thank you though to all who've commented :)

Edit2: so many replies!! I'm so thankful to all of you for your kind words of wisdom and encouragement. I'm learning to forgive my friends for their ignorant comments and learning every day to love myself more. I'd comment on every single one of y'all's replies but that would take up too much unnecessary space I think, lol. Thank y'all so much...",57,85,False,self,,,,,

So far it seems we have:    
(Thanks to U/SongMinho and U/Ayikorena and [Fuse](https://www.fuse.tv/videos/2017/09/celebrities-who-love-bts) for the lists and this probably isn't even all of them, feel free to tell me more in the comments and I'll add them below.)

***Artists that have hinted collabs:***    
- Maroon 5    
- Steve Aoki    
- Charlie Puth    
- Gallant

***Artists that have mentioned they'd be down to collab:***    
- DNCE    
- Zedd    
- Kehlani    
- Tinashe    
- Ansel Elgort (most down for a collab celebrity for sure)    
- Shawn Mendes    
- Post Malone    
- Camila Cabello

***Artists with high collaborative potential:***    
These are mainly based on friendships/interactions so really this list is endless but I figured I'd just put it in in case it comes up. Some that come to mind for me are: Marshmello, Halsey, Charlie XCX and Major Lazer (Diplo has worked with GD, so even more fuel potential to add to the fire) but theres so so many more.

**Anyways, my question is, how do you guys think these collaborations will be released? And, what kind of collaborations do you even think they'll be?**

They could literally sing together like with FOB and Desiigner, they could produce together sound/beat wise like with Aoki or they could write together (sorry idk any of the official terms for these things lol). Then there's remixes vs original songs to consider as well. All these different options have different release potentials imo. For example, to me, a writing collaboration feels more likely to be on the next comeback and a remix or feature seems more likely to be released as a single.

As for how they're released, I honestly don't have a solid prediction. I feel like it could go numerous ways.    
I see it as three options: 1. the song could be released from the collab artist's end like Champion. 2. As a non-album single from BTS. 3. On a future album.    

I apologize in advance for how long and all over the place my next thoughts will be.
  
BTS album wise, idk, I don't think they'd have *too many* collabs on their next LY album because that would take away the focus from them. Even western artists usually only feature a few collabs on their albums and BTS doesn't seem to have many (esp actually singing together wise) in their main discography at all. Then there's audience reaction/expectations to consider. If the collabs are English heavy the asian market might not like having too many of those on their next comeback as it could be considered negatively, like they're not embracing their own culture and language enough. I know that sounds crazy but the media's a hellfire and I could see stuff like that being said. U/StarlightLovers mentioned she wondered how they could make the collabs fit the LY concept/theme, so that's another point to consider too.

This is probably more ""out there,"" but they could also release a separate album that's collab focused? Santana did this with his Supernatural album and it was very successful (it won 8 Grammys). Fall Out Boy released an entire remix album for American Beauty/American Psycho (Make America Psycho Again) filled with collabs so there's definitely options and *some* potential for this type of album to be done.

If there is a heavy amount of collabs on an official LY album, I think a good place for them would be the repackage. They often have remixes and alternate versions on these so it feels like they'd be the perfect place to put collabs. Especially if theyre remixes. This is probably my favorite option but as it's the furthest away it's probably the least likely. Idk how long they'd want to sit on these collabs and from the artist hints we've gotten it seems we'll get them sooner rather than later.

Anyways, please tell me your thoughts, predictions and hopes on this matter!

edit: I didn't really touch on solo/unit collabs vs group ones bc I think I've seen threads on that before but I lean towards the solo or unit prediction, the latter (units) of which I'd love to see.",47,66,False,self,,,,,

Now, you may be thinking. What did you do? I can still see Bangtan, their faces are crystal clear, what gives?

And that would be reasonable - I didn't do much! But I'm going to detail them anyway because this is my post and I want to

* Replaced ""Rap Monster"" with RM - By the time the single released (171206), Namjoon had already changed his stage name (although he was technically still Rap Monster during Love Yourself Her)

* Switched the order of Suga &amp; Jin (originally, Jin was after Suga) so that they're in fanchant order (by leader, then by age)

* As you can see in the album, I included 2 versions of each cover - one with ""Jung Kook"" (this shows up in official merch occasionally, so having the space between wasn't too grating), and then another one with just ""Jungkook"" (like how Jimin's name is). At first I was only gonna do Jung Kook ones but about halfway through I decided to do one-name versions because that might be annoying to other people too.

I included all 4 versions of the cover so if you want to replace the cover you have then feel free to. (For iTunes/Apple Music at least here's how you would do so - [Press this](https://i.imgur.com/EqGvxHi.png), then go to the Artwork tab, right click to remove the existing artwork and then replace with your own.)

2017 represented [a lot of growth for BTS](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8078599/bts-2017-year-highlights-timeline-recap) and multiple surprises for us, especially with the Wings tour and all the press exposure the boys got with the BBMAs and AMAs; and with that exposure came the booming growth of our lovely sub.

It's been just over a year since we started doing projects, and especially for those who are new to the subreddit, we wanted to look back on this year's past projects and discuss the future of upcoming projects. 

Don't worry! We're not going anywhere, we just want to plan better, and also include feedback and opinions from you guys! After all, the projects are for all of us and we want to make sure we are doing our best to express what's important to our members.

This post contains 2017 Achievements, 2018 Plans, About the Team, and Feedback Information.

**We included a tl;dr at the end for our skim readers.**

&amp;nbsp;

#MISSION STATEMENT 

These projects are an act of love coordinated on behalf of the subreddit as a small way to show our support for BTS and give back to the 7 lovable, genuine, talented, extra, handsome, crazy dorks/angels/icons/pied pipers who brought us all together and have given us so much through their hard work. As the sub grows, so will we. We hope to continue to improve the quality and impact of our projects in 2018 and in years to come, walking together with the members of r/bangtan for a long time, giving and showing our gratitude, love, and mutual respect for BTS and for each other as ARMY.

#2017 ACHIEVEMENTS

## **Over $1,500 USD raised!**

Through the following projects, r/bangtan has raised $1573.93 USD for charities, which is no small feat!

To keep this post as short as possible, we're only highlighting the main points of each project. Each summary links to a more detailed description of each project.

&amp;nbsp;

[**RICE WREATHS FOR V**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5ji5ei/bts_projects_closing_post_for_the_rice_wreaths/) | Congratulatory wreath sent to show our sub's support for V's first acting project, Hwarang. Together we raised $320 USD and bought 100 kg ^(220 lbs) of rice!!

[**2016 CENSUS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/) | Curious about the demographics of this sub, we conducted a census to poll members on things like age, location, and several BTS-related topics. 796 members from 64 different countries participated in the census. We compiled responses into a book which we distributed as a PDF on the sub and sent a hard copy to BigHit as a representation of our community.

[**J-HOPE BIRTHDAY '17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5uqk4r/closing_post_for_the_jhope_birthday_project/) | J-Hope always tries to have a smile on his face to brighten our day, so we thought it would be nice if we did something to brighten up his day. We received fan art, messages, and a lot of inspirational quotes. For the charity donation, we bought solar lanterns (a total of about $40 USD) for families in need, since J-Hope is our light, our hope, and sunshine incarnate.

[**SUGA BIRTHDAY '17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/61xtuw/suga_17_birthday_project_closing_post/) | The theme for Suga's birthday project had to do with his music: how has his music impacted you? All 77 submissions touched in some way on his lyrics or the personal impact of his music. Together with your help, we were able to raise and donate $408.21 USD to KAPS [^Korean ^website](http://www.koreananimals.or.kr) ^| [^English ^FB ^page](https://www.facebook.com/KAPSAnimals). 
  
[**4th ANNIVERSARY PROJECT**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6hwepu/4th_anniversary_project_closing_post/) |  86 sub members were each assigned a letter character that comprised the acrostic message: *Teamwork truly made the dream work. We are proud of how far you guys have come. Now only the sky is your limit.* Each participant created art or messages around their assigned letter and their work was compiled into a book and sent to BigHit. For the charitable component, we raised and donated $182.88 USD to the [Korean Association for Suicide Prevention](http://suicideprevention.or.kr/m/main/main.php) [^English ^info ^here](https://www.younghealthprogrammeyhp.com/programmes/korea.html). Mental health is a very important topic for the boys and for many of us that have been touched by their lyrics, so we thought what better way to extend a hand and reach out to help others the way BTS' music helped us.

[**JUNGKOOK BIRTHDAY '17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70qxpd/closing_post_jk_birthday_project_2017/) | Since in the past Kookie mentioned he likes photography, a photography ""map"" was our theme for this project. We grouped photographs (and their respective entries - fan art or letters) depending on where the image was taken (and fan art and letters by the location of the sender). We received 154 entries from 50 participants in over 20 countries! Together we donated $75.72 USD to [BAPS](http://shindogs.org/) (Busan Abandoned Pet Sanctuary), since Kookie [mentioned](http://www.vlive.tv/video/17071) wanting to help abandoned dogs in the past.

[**RM BIRTHDAY '17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70qxuq/closing_post_rm_birthday_project_2017/) | For Namjoon's project, we did a fan version of his #RMusic recs called #ARMYMusic. Entries were styled like tweets; fan art, fan letters, and photographs were also collected. We received 198 #ARMYmusic entries and 28 other entries from 86 contributors! Paired with this project was a charity donation in his name to [WE Charity/Free the Children](https://www.we.org/gb/about-we-charity/about-us/) of $120.12 USD. 

[**JIMIN BIRTHDAY '17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/76xnn0/closing_post_jimin_birthday_project_2017/) | *""At one point of someday, everything you did, would be exactly what you will be.""* Memories help make us who we are, and for Jimin's birthday project, we chose the theme of ""memories."" You shared stories, photos, and fanart around this theme, which we put into a lovely book with an adorable blue mold cat flipbook animation in the corner. In honor of our  , we also raised $262 USD for Whiskers Ministop [^FB ^page](https://www.facebook.com/whiskersministop/) ^| [^IG ^page](https://www.instagram.com/cats.whiskers.ministop/), a cat rehoming &amp; no-kill shelter in Seoul.
  
[**JIN BIRTHDAY '17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7o19ak/jin_and_v_birthday_projects_closing_post/) | They say the way to your heart is through your stomach. Since Jin is the king of hearts (and food) for BTS, we asked everyone to share their favorite recipes, food, or memories of favorite meals with him for his birthday. Along with your sincere birthday wishes, every yummy contribution was added to an #EatARMY ""cookbook"" and delivered to BigHit as a present for Jin. We also raised $85 USD towards the [Love Myself campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/post-eng/about-love-myself/) [^Int'l ^donations](http://www.unicef.or.kr/donation/en/index.asp) to be donated in his honor.
  
[**V BIRTHDAY '17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7o19ak/jin_and_v_birthday_projects_closing_post/) | As BTS' resident photographer and visual art-lover, r/bangtan members sent photography, fanart, and recommendations of their favorite visual art to V for his birthday. The images of art were compiled in a book, along with messages of support, in an Instagram-style layout and delivered to BigHit. In his name, we also raised $80 USD in donations for the [Love Myself campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/post-eng/about-love-myself/) [^Int'l ^donations](http://www.unicef.or.kr/donation/en/index.asp)!

[**SECRET SANTA**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/771gjm/rbangtans_2017_secret_santa/) | In February 2017, Erin came up with the crazy idea to hold the sub's first secret santa gift exchange, and because the best things usually begin with a crazy idea, everyone said ""why not?!"" and pitched in to help support Erin's vision. Santas from across the world paired up and exchanged fantastic, heartfelt, creative presents. You can check out some of the great presents you guys exchanged on the /r/SSbangtan subreddit. Erin has also set up a [form where you can provide feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek3BWk_LBxpMwwdejDuoUTQDfCYkb1S-AJza2lFE_lsHMsxA/viewform) to help improve SS for next year (Yes! we will be doing SS in 2018 as well!)

&amp;nbsp;

#VISION FOR 2018 (SO FAR)

First, a note on our books. BTS [recently announced](https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/955998704271425536) that they will no longer accept gifts in the mail after March 30, 2018, only letters. The 2017 Census, Suga Birthday &amp; J-Hope Birthday projects will be printed and shipped before the deadline. For future projects, we're verifying whether or not our small books of compiled messages are acceptable.

&amp;nbsp;

**2017 CENSUS** | We received over 1,500 responses this year (almost double last year's participation). We love data. And we love **lots** of data. But lots of data also means it takes more time to sort through. We have been working steadily on categorizing and quantifying your responses and will have the results soon. Information will also be compiled into a book that will be posted to the sub and a formatted into a hard copy layout that we will send to BigHit in February. We're also creating a form for feedback on the census process from everyone who participated so we have an even better project next time.

**BIRTHDAY PROJECTS** |  Because we stan an awesome group that supports UNICEF's campaign to #ENDViolence, all charitable donations for 2018 birthday projects will go to the LOVE MYSELF campaign! Since iARMY can now donate directly, we've set up a [form where you can notify us of your individual donation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYzsA-58zbKmBm1B8B7sdyM1adGfRjq3jBvNf1OMXnvzr_VA/viewform) if you'd prefer to donate yourself, rather than going through us. Provided BigHit says they are acceptable, we will still have the books with cute layouts where we will compile your messages, photos, and/or arts, and we'll continue to include suggested themes to help prompt the creative process. We'll no longer do exhaustive, overly specific themes like #ARMYMusic. We don't want to be too restrictive on what people can submit and we want to focus more of our energy into completing projects in a timely manner, making sure all entries make it error-free to the final product, and creating more opportunities for the sub to show support in different ways. Speaking of which, [J-Hope &amp; Suga's Birthday Projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7s42qe/jhope_and_suga_birthday_projects_2018/) are currently underway, so send your birthday congrats!!

**5th ANNIVERSARY PROJECT &amp; ARMY MUSTSERVE** | BTS' announcement they are no longer accepting gifts is perfect timing because we've been thinking a lot about nonmaterial ways we can show our support, and many sub members have expressed interest in this kind of philanthropic initiative. You guys know how BTS holds annual gatherings for ARMY called 'Muster'? For 2018, we'll be launching a new initiative geared towards acts of charity and community service called ARMY MustServe ^(ba dum tss). In a nutshell, we're encouraging ARMY to support charities and/or participate in community service in BTS' name and share their experiences. We'll have more in-depth post on ARMY MustServe coming soon!

**SECRET SANTA** | Our first ever Secret Santa this year was a huge success so we'll be continuing this brand new r/bangtan tradition into 2018! We're looking for [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek3BWk_LBxpMwwdejDuoUTQDfCYkb1S-AJza2lFE_lsHMsxA/viewform) on your SS experience so we can make it even better next year. 

#ABOUT THE TEAM

Before we were even BTSprojects, this whole thing started as a few of us wanting to send Suga fan messages after his mixtape dropped. There was a discussion thread about his mixtape and how it affected us each in a personal way. A lot of you wanted to congratulate him, others wanted to thank him... everyone had something they wanted to say to him. So, some of us decided, why not compile all our letters and send them for him to read? [And so we did](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/585nts/letter_compilation_project_we_will_be_in_full/). 
 
We never imagined that we would be running birthday, anniversary, and census projects when we started... but here we are! And we are immensely thankful to you guys for your constant support. Here are the currently active members of the subreddit's Projects Team - spending late nights organizing events, poring over excel sheets, yelling at InDesign, and struggling with form code ^(and maybe memeing). And we do it because we love BTS, love our sub, and want to show r/bangtan's big heart and awesome members to BigHit and BTS. If you see us around the sub, feel free to say hello!

Special shoutout to r/bangtan delivery angels - /u/AverageAnnie, /u/Rubyrues, and /u/queenbratinella - who climbed mountains, leapt tall buildings (and printed a correction page that one time ^ooops) to get our books safely into the hands of BigHit staff.

Here's a ^hopefully complete list of [2016-2017 Project Volunteers, Illustrators, and Translators](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xl-rT8JvMvRxmXOVc1JWuFsHGSg3fc8lu7eGaNJfk7E/edit?usp=sharing). Thank you very much!

&amp;nbsp;

**VOLUNTEERS NEEDED** | We are a group of fans (not the moderators) who do a whole bunch of projects. Most of us are students or adults with full time jobs, so we are **always looking for volunteers!** If you're willing to help out with any projects or initiatives, please send us a [volunteer form](https://goo.gl/forms/tCiffDvzOBkiMyti1) to show you're interested in joining. You can help throughout the year or with specific projects or initiatives. We're always looking for new members, so just let us know your availability!


**FUNDING** | Many of our activities, such as printing and shipping the compilation books, have a cost associated with them. The members of the projects team personally try to cover all printing and shipping costs so as many members of r/bangtan as possible can participate without worry and as much of your donations as possible go to charity. That said, it can get expensive. 

If you would like to contribute towards the projects fund, you may do so through [our PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/foryoongs/send?amount=10&amp;currencyCode=USD&amp;locale.x=en_US&amp;country.x=US) (just add a note that its for administrative costs). You can also earmark a portion of your donation to **any project** towards administrative/printing/shipping costs by adding a note when you donate through Paypal. We are investigating alternative ways to raise funds to cover any project costs, if necessary, in the future, such as raffles and selling fan goods. We aim to be 100% transparent about funding and how it is allocated. If you ever have any question or concern about this, please DM us and a member of the projects team will respond as soon as possible.
 
&amp;nbsp;


#FEEDBACK 

As the sub continues to grow, it's vital that our projects continue to reflect what's important to our members. 

If you have any questions, opinions, or comments, our ears and our inboxes are always open. 
We want to hear from all of you (yes, even you, lovely lurkers!) We have made an [anonymous feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/YuDSBmiiLvxaCOtj2) so you can be as open and honest as possible. We exist to serve this community and plan projects based on our members' passions, interests, and contributions, so we really want you to be honest with us with regards to what's on your mind, what concerns you, what you would like to see more (or less) of, and/or what you look forward to.

You can also always DM us, leave a comment on this post, or tweet us [@rbangtan_armies](https://twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) if you have feedback or questions.

#Part 2: BTS ""Topics that we addressed through music; hoped we could worry/think about together""#    
^source:http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2018/01/27/0200000000AKR20180127003600005.HTML?input=1195m      
^translation: ^u/diminie ^and ^u/grk637  
.    

If one had to choose one particular thing that makes the BTS class something different, the answer would be music that they themselves create. They reveal what their contemporaries lack and worry and comfort them with sympathy.  
.  

Their tone is sometimes mature like an older persons and sometimes straightforward like a friends.  
.  

To the youth hoping the tomorrow would be different from today, they say we were idols from small company with nothing special that used to be cut from broadcast, and there is despair where there is hope (Sea). They cheer them up by saying stop trying too hard, its okay to lose (Fire). And they shout out loud, full of spirit, break the glass ceiling that traps you (Not Today).  

.  
They also talk about the problem of educational system characterized by excessive competition for entrance exams, sampo generation that suffers from tough reality, passion pay, and spoon class theory, all of which are distanced from typical idol music. The words in their lyrics such as YOLO and tangjin jam also reflect social phenomena, making them easier to be absorbed by listeners.  

.  
Who made us a study machine? / We are labeled as a failure if we are not the best (N.O), I like beef jerky^1' so let me be the generation that gives up 6 things^2 / The media and adults say we dont have will, condemning us like stocks^3 (Dope), We get passion-paid at part-time jobs, , this isnt normal (Baepsae), and so on.   

&gt;^1: (diminie note: beef jerky is , pronounced as yook-po)  
 
&gt;^2: (diminie note:  is a variation of  (sampo generation above), 
and  here is an abbreviation of giving up six things as  is six and  comes from , 
which means give up).  

&gt;^3: (diminie note: its a wordplay as has two meanings: (1) condemn and (2) sell (stocks))  
.  

Until they made that difference, they had constantly releasing unofficial tracks on soundcloud for the past 5 years, learning the joy of creating and deepening the meaning of lyrics. Sometimes they got inspirations from literature.  

.  
Having that as a stepping stone, they have brought up issues by releasing the school trilogy and youth series with a solid storytelling. And in the album they released last year, LOVE YOURSELF  HER, they suggested that we look for ways to love oneself together.  

.  
BTS, who we interviewed recently in Nonhyeon-dong, Gangnam-gu, emphasized that they want to open up a discussion of how one can be happy and love himself or herself and that they wish many people can altogether reflect on this.  
.  

RM, the leader, talked about the message they want to carry in the next album. We want to find our own conclusion from Love Yourself and we want to get closer to the way of self-loving while being faithful to the sentiment.    
.   
.  
**-- Over the course of 5 years, youve released a large number of unofficial music via Soundcloud, your consistency seems to differentiate you from some other idols.**    
 
&gt;**Suga**: Consistency is fascinating. There wasnt a specific plan, its that we like music and releasing it was fun. In that way, you can understand our unofficial releases. If a producer were to work on it commercially, it really wouldnt make any sense. We heard Why is this being released? a lot but theres only one reason, because its so fun. Making it, releasing it, then receiving feedback, while sometimes its difficult to express some messages and sincerity through [written text], we can express them through music. Were a team that express ourselves often and they say we make good use of SNS but the unofficial releases are another method [of expression]. Its not an easy choice to release [an album with] 10 tracks each of original music, we can only express it by saying, we do it because we want to. This type of process helps us when making our albums. I have a bit of a personal regret with unofficial tracks that were released awhile ago because they were from a time when I had many thoughts and angular corners (t/n: harsh, unsociable) but thanks to those tracks, it feels as though my sharp corners have been smoothed down. It was one of the turning points in my life, I think Ive developed more, musically.  
.  
    
**-- Before the album about the Youth series, Hwayangyeonhwa came out, I heard you had many worries about your musical direction. Whether there was trial and error, through what process did you find your direction?** 

&gt;**RM**: Even without considering entering Billboard charts and ranking on Melon, there are always musical trials and errors. If the trial and error of our past was How can we appeal to the general public and our fans while protecting our identity?, presently its wrestling with what title track should follow DNA, now that there are many people listening [to our music]. As there was great tangible outcome through big and small trials and errors, the next title track will also go through countless trials and errors. Four years ago, our song Danger entered Melon at 54 and charted out in one day and didnt return; because we remember that time, we are deeply moved and we must continue to go through trials and errors, going forward.  
  
&gt;. 
 
&gt;**J-hope**: While active as BTS, we are, also, studying. When I have a topic in mind, I worry a lot about how best to convey my own personal story.  

&gt;.  
   

**-- If you take a look at all the albums youve released so far, the themes are all different but there is continuity in that they contain messages that your peers can relate to. In what way do the seven members collect their different thoughts?**  

&gt;**Suga**: Our work process is for everyone to participate with one topic and beat. There needs to be some reference point in that situation so that the producers can pick the best [ideas] to organize and refine it. Weve always done things with clear reference points because weve talked a lot about right and wrong.  Weve earned sympathy/relatability because weve started at a point where anyone could agree that No matter who see it, this is right or no matter who sees it, this is wrong.  

&gt;.  

**-- Are there any lyrics that you find satisfying every time you sing them?**  

&gt;**Suga**: For me, `The dawn is the the darkest right before the sun rises` from Tomorrow is the line I like the most. I also wrote it effortlessly.  
.  

&gt;**Jungkook**: From Sea, theres the line `Where there is hope, there is despair.'`  I dont really know why but it really hit me.  
(Sea was a song written by RM, inspired by the sentence, Where theres hope, theres a trial from 1Q84.)  
.  


&gt;**RM**: Of the lyrics I wrote most recently, I like Best of Me. They are words written to our fans, ARMY; the line goes `'I wanted to be a kind/warm wave but why didnt I realize you were the ocean?'` I like it because it means that I thought, in my own way, I wanted to become a big help, like a kind wave, to our fans but in looking back, I realized that the fans were much larger [of a wave] than me and the ones that made me [who I am].  
.  


&gt;**J-hope**: I have exactly two. The first is from the song 2! 3!: ` for being the flowers in our most beautiful moment in life (hwayangyeonhwa).` [That line] is talking to our fans through lyrics but its pretty. With that meaning, whenever I sing [those lyrics] I really feel it. For us, our hwayangyeonhwa was that through such a meaningful album, our fans became beautiful flowers. The second is the part that goes `I want to be young forever` from EPILOGUE: Young Forever; I think itll be a part Im reminded of more as time goes by.  
.  


&gt;**Jimin**: Its all the lyrics of EPILOGUE: Young Forever, in its entirety. Its a song that caused us to cry a lot because it encapsulates all the thoughts we have as weve gone through our concerts.  
.  


&gt;**V**: I like all lyrics that RM hyung has written. I like all of the lyrics in EPILOGUE: Young Forever but if I had to pick just one line, its the part that goes `That I could make someone scream [with joy],'``'I want to be young forever.`  
.  


&gt;**Jin**: From 2!3! its, `Its ok, say one, two, three and forget it all.` Im an avoidant type of person[ality] so I forget all bad memories. Im always striving to be happy in the present so those lyrics really hit me. To become happy now, Ive lived thinking you have to forget all the bad memories.   
.  

**-- Youre in the middle of preparing your new album, what message are you thinking of conveying?**
.  
&gt;**Suga**: Right now, its just a big picture so were not at a stage where we can talk about it. During the height of our tour last year [until now], what we talked about, amongst ourselves, was happiness. What is happiness and what should one do to attain it? Im a person who doesnt think one can become happier just by trying to be happier but I think its necessary to make the effort to become happier. You have to study and research it. Since I was young, Ive pondered a lot about what happiness is, what must one do to become happy. I dont think anyone has ever taught it. I think if we address the topic, many people will [be able to] discuss it.  
. 
 
&gt;**RM**: I, too, was fixated on the keyword: happiness, until the beginning of last year. However, while in Japan a little bit ago, I read a newspaper article that said human beings can never achieve the happiness that they want. That our DNA is wired that way so we can never attain that happiness. It said that while humans have achieved the Industrial Revolution, development of science and many other goals through ambition, when they achieve in one area, they feel deficient in another. I also felt like Id be happy by becoming 1st place but I continue to have another goal. I was convinced by that article. So rather than happiness, lets find our own conclusions from what were talking about currently with Love Yourself. Love Yourself means to find the process to loving yourself. My dream isnt to be #1 on Billboard but to properly be able to love myself because even if I face my ugliness and shabbiness a few billion times, I dont think Ill [fully] reach it. Now that Im fortunate enough to have met the concept of Love Yourself, I want to stay true to the emotion and take, even if its just one, a step closer to loving myself more. There are many words that can be used in this topic, darkness, solitude, etc.  

&gt;.  

**-- Lyrics inspired by 1Q84 and Demian and even referencing the short story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas in the Spring Day M/V, what books are you reading right now?**  
  
&gt;**Suga**: Ive read many books recently. Like early adopters, I liked digital machines/technology however Ive gone back to analog. Ive gone back to writing and reading, like I did when I was young and I recently read Life Lessons by psychiatrist and author Elisabeth Kbler-Ross. I have several other of her books as well. Im currently reading Banana Yoshimotos About Her ()  

&gt;.  


&gt;**RM**: I saw it around the house so Im reading Banana Yoshimotos Kitchen.

&gt;.  

&gt;**J-Hope**: I want to go back to the innocence of my childhood and reread the French novelist Jules Vernes classic science fiction novel 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Around the World in 80 Days. These days, innocence of childhood brings peace of mind/relaxes me.

&gt;.  


&gt;**V**: The book Ive been making an effort to read recently is Phillip Chesterfields Letters To His Son

&gt;.  


**-- As representatives at the forefront of K-pop, what do you think is the unique value of K-pop receiving love despite being in the Korean language?**  

&gt;**RM**: K-pop is comprehensive art, like a total art package. Music and music video, individual characteristics of the members, contents revealed through Youtube and SNS, fashion, etc; its a genre that has various elements of entertainment. It gives the public a friendly and varied things to enjoy. Fans identify with lyrics, meanwhile they look at daily videos and photos on Twitter and get to know our personalities and feel a sense of closeness. K-Pop has many black holes into which you can fall through.  

&gt;.    

&gt;**Suga**: It hasnt been that long since the word K-Pop has existed so there is still too much for us to do in order to clearly say K-Pop is like this. Like how the K-Pop category reappeared on Billboard, something seems to have started again but its to early to conclude anything yet.

First they signed on with Gramaphone media in late 2016 as their public relations team for North America.

https://www.gramophone.media/

As we all know they hustled their asses off for a year until things finally started coming to fruition with a HUGE assist from the Billboard Music Awards and Dick Clark Productions. (They produce the Billboard Music Awards, The American Music Awards and Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve).

Then late last year we heard that they struck a deal with Amazon to stock their physical albums in the US so each sale would count towards the US charts. Then we heard about their distribution deal with The Orchard:

http://www.theorchard.com

Although Im not sure which came first, the Amazon deal or The Orchard deal. Or did The Orchard broker the Amazon deal?  As we all know things got off to a rocky start there as there were problems with stocking the physicals and shipping got delayed for a couple of weeks. Then there were talks of brick and mortar stores like Target and Best Buy stocking the album in stores as well as selling them online. But they also had stocking issues and the store stock was sporadic at best.

Then Mic Drop released and radio DJ JJ Ryan let the cat out of the bag that it was Sony RED that was handling servicing the song to radio.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RED_Distribution

http://www.redmusic.com

Now that begs the question, did Big Hit sign a new deal with RED? A little research shows that The Orchard and RED merged last year around the same time Mic Drop started getting sent to radio.

Did they just get swept up in the merger or have more services been negotiated? The Orchard was originally just for distribution but now they have a radio team pushing their single to radio. They didnt have that in September when DNA was released.

I feel like Big Hit have been getting their ducks in a row for the next release. The physical album is now FINALLY in stock in Targets across America. They have been formally invited to The I Heart Radio awards which is a sign that US radio is finally welcoming them.

I am VERY curious to see how this next album cycle will go in the US now they have a lot of the key elements of pr, radio and distribution finally lining up.

After seeing some demand for a book club discussion on the subreddit and tinkering around with the Goodreads layout with the server to get it all set up, we're happy to introduce the /r/bangtan Book Club! There hasn't been as much activity yet, but we're hoping that will change!

The bookshelves we have are as follows:

* **Namjoon's Bookshelf:** Any books that Namjoon has recommended or has mentioned.
* **BTS Concepts:** Any literature that is thematically linked with the storylines and theories in HYYH/Wings/Love Yourself.
* **/r/bangtan Recommendations:** Books that have been recommended by users of the subreddit and Discord server.

We also have corners for casual book chat and poetry, and we're happy to add other topics like school reading lists too!

We try to have a bit of a structured schedule on the server for reading certain books, but otherwise things are pretty go-at-your-own-pace on the Goodreads page.

Since we want to keep the quality of reddit discussion on the /r/bangtan Book Club page and keep the userbase as the same comfortable group of people you'd see here, please be sure to verify your reddit username if you request an invite. *We will not be accepting invite requests if this form is not filled out!*

Thank you all so much! I hope to see you all at book club!

After this post, you will be free from all the /r/bangtan awards posts for another year! Hopefully 2018 will be a just as exciting year, for you and for BTS!   

Without further ado, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/bangtanawards17) is a link to the wiki page that contains the results for this years awards! (If youre curious about 2016s awards, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/bangtanawards) is the link to that wiki page~)  

609 people participated in the final round of voting this year total, which is great! There was a large increase in participation compared to last year, which, while expected due to the growth of this sub in general, certainly made me feel like doing this myself was worth it! So a big thank you to everyone who participated and submitted nominations :) I organize this as just one person, and not as a mod of the subreddit (I asked for permission from the rest of the mods to sticky the announcements about this like a regular user :P) so it really means a lot to me that this was such a success!  

If you have any feedback, comments, or suggestions about the way these awards work, please leave them down below! I filled this out after a long day, so there might be some errors. Pls help me fix any you see!  

for the runners up, I'm too tired to add in all the links to them right now. When I have more time later I might go back and add in all the links for them - for now I've just added links to the ones that seem necessary to me.    

#[Again, heres the link to the results!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/bangtanawards17)

I'm a semi-new ARMY who became a fan after seeing BTS on the Billboard Music Awards last year. Since getting into BTS, they also introduced me to other groups in Kpop. Before BTS and the BBMAs, the only thing I knew about Kpop was Psy and Gangnam Style. 

The reason I made this post is because I often see this trend of other fandoms preaching about how BTS didn't pave the way for Kpop, their seniors like Psy, Wonder girls, SNSD, etc. paved the way, and that BTS would not have risen were it not for the foundations laid by those before them. 

I understand that I may come across as extremely ignorant, disrespectful, and arrogant (as often said by people in r/Kpop) , hence I would like to hear other opinions that may convince me otherwise. In my opinion and personal experience, Psy's Gangnam Style was actually extremely off-putting and was treated as a novelty and joke. Rather than ""pave the way"" for my interest in Kpop, it actually turned me away. This is obviously anecdotal, but I reckon it's not just me that felt this way. 

Why do I feel like a lot of other fandoms are overhyping the impact of older Kpop acts and their influence on the West while simultaneously downplaying the incredible impact that BTS has had?  I was not around in the Kpop scene back then so perhaps I am blind to it. I feel like BTS paved the way for BTS. Even on google trends, BTS is searched for SO MUCH MORE than Kpop (the two search terms diverge a LOT) so I don't understand the repeated claim that Kpop's rise in popularity is causing BTS' rise in popularity (rather than the reverse). 

Anyway, I'm probably just salty about that thread, and general comments I see on the internet that try to deny BTS' impact and brand all ARMYs as delusion. A lot of usually-reasonable seeming people on the  Kpop sub seem very passionate about sharing this sentiment, so now I'm doubting myself. What is the truth, then?

(which you could read here : https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7mwggq/comeback_theories_two_the_magic_shop_stories/)



I decided to look through the books especially recommended, and based off from the clue:

""The magical time is coming. Come to the Magic Shop. Now take off your mask and open your eyes.""



Since ""HER"" covered the development part of :

 = Introduction

 = Development

 = Twist/Turn of Events/Conflict

 = Conclusion



A theory on allkpop suggested this story line:

""If we look at the whole album's lyrics chronologically, at first theyre overconfident and boastful in their new-found relationship and happiness, to the point where it almost feels like a false sense of security and a facade. And true enough, the Outro of the album suddenly changes the tune and forebodes the drama and character development thats to come in the  and  albums. In the Outro, the lyrics are suddenly insecure and confused. They talk about burying your complexes, personal struggles and insecurities deep inside when you fall for someone, basically hiding your true self behind a mask/faade from the person you love. Thereby foreboding that this is gonna come back to haunt them and most likely ruin their new-found relationship and happiness in the future releases. Further pointing out the importance of loving and accepting yourself, which is what this character development series is all about.""



Seeing this, I read through both, and I felt like Wells' fairytale (http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/10/) fitted more with the ""love"" story line that BTS is trying to express. Especially after I read this answer on Yahoo discussing about it:

""...the vague idea remains with me of a young boy still innocent and accepting and a father who sees evil or, at least, something rather wrong. The line between magic and reality becomes thin. Here are a couple of quotes that might help: 

""This is a charming tale from H.G. Wells about a young boy named Gip who visits a magic shop for his birthday with his father. But this is not just any magic shop  the shopkeeper insists that this is a genuine magic shop. The story is an entertaining adventure as Gip, like any young boy of his age, experiences the pure enjoyment of true magic while his skeptical father grapples with having to draw the line between slight of hand and genuine magic"" 



Knowing Bangtan's way of choosing books which uses tales to show complex and extended metaphors about life...and Namjoonie's love for those kind of books made it seem a more likely choice than Into the Magic Shop, which I found was about the science of therapy, meditation and accepting yourself which was the magic.

Overall, their end message is ""I am worthy. I am loved. I am cared for. I care for others. I choose only good for myself. I choose only good for others. I love myself. I love others. I open my heart. My heart is open. 

The message of loving yourself seems like the conclusion for the love yourself series, not where we're at the moment.

Although its likely BTS used both books thematically anyways - ""Her"" didn't limit itself to one bit of the love storyline too. 

What do you think?

Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7u8mph/bts_official_shop_en_question/,SheepishSleepySheep,1517389229,"[UPDATE: figured it out, the Order PWD was the password you make when you first fill out the billing form while purchasing. Thanks for the quick response, despite how obvious it may seem, I probably never would have figured that out on my own or even remember creating the password lol] 

Let me start by saying I have never ordered from an overseas company outside of amazon before and am a relatively new ARMY so if the answers here are obvious I apologize in advance. :)

(also sorry if I formatted this wrong, I don't use reddit often and tried to follow the rules for this subreddit, but I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly)

So I ordered the Love Yourself album set from the official shop on the 24 of January and I'm not quite sure how to check its status? (I know it takes a couple weeks to ship out usually, but I still wanted to check regardless). 

I (stupidly) didn't create an account at the time which would undoubtedly made this process 10x easier, but when I go the page to login it has an option for nonmembers to check the status of their orders. I have my order confirmation order from the email the shop sent my when I first ordered the item, but I have no clue what it means when it asks for the ""Order PWD""?

 If I don't have this, what information should I send to the Q&amp;A board to get it? I made an account now, so do I just send my confirmation number or will they need all my billing information again as well? Is there an easier way to go about this? I know some people mentioned getting an EMS number, is that the same as the confirmation number or is that something different? 

I would have gone straight to the Q&amp;A forum with this as the FAQ didn't help but I'm not exactly quite sure what I should be asking for? Basically all I want to know is if tracking the status of my order is possible (which I'm positive it is) and how to go about it if I wasn't a member at the time of the purchase.

 Now that I have an account when I buy things in the future it will be easier (I'm still kicking myself for not just doing that from the get go)but I really hope that this doesn't mean I'm just going to stranded in limbo essentially until my package arrives on some random day lol.

Thanks in advance for the help :)

[EVER](https://imgur.com/4CRzF3q)!!!

&amp;nbsp;

But seriously, we've reached out to BigHit, clarifying our Birthday Projects, describing that our books are a collection of letters from international fans. However, they explained that **items shipped inside a box will be treated as a gift**, and will be politely declined after March 30th.

## So what now?

Have no fear! We've considered the possibility of the books being classified as gifts, so we've had time to think about the future letters to BTS. Our ideas include both digital collections as well as physical prints -- think A4-sized cards or pages of letters. **We will have a proper post outlining this in more detail once we've sent out The Last Books**\*, but we wanted to update everyone (and maybe spur you into sending your J-Hope and Suga submissions).

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, please feel free to hit us with suggestions for the future BTS letters!

Again, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO BE IN A ~SHINY~ PATENTED BTS PROJECTS BOOK!!!!!! Better [send in your birthday messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7s42qe/jhope_and_suga_birthday_projects_2018/)!!

&amp;nbsp;

Patiently awaiting your submissions,

The BTS Projects Team

\* P.S. The Last Books include 2017 Census, along with the J-Hope and Suga books.

##Edited to add:

(*Thank you to the commenters who brought this up!*)

While the fan club manager mentioned that anything in a box is considered a gift, **this does not imply that packages not-in-a-box will be considered as not-a-gift**. Their intent is still clear -- that is, no packages -- and we would like to avoid having our letters sent back or rejected. :(",18,111,False,self,,,,,
