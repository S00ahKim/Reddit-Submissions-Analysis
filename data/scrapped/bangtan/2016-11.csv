While surfing around the internet, it caught my attention that i-fans use some Korean words. What made me laugh was Omo, unni, oppa things. A Thai fan on youtube asked me some questions and so I was chatting with her, and she, as soon as she found me older than herself, called me ""oppa!"". I was surprised and asked, 'why do you call me oppa?"" then she said, ""because you are older than me"". I   told her ""oppa is a term only for older male"". Then she immediately said, ""oh, sorry, Nuna!"" It really made me roll on the floor because nuna is a term for a younger male to call older female. So finally she called me unnie. It was a refreshing experience because it made me think about the terms that I have been using without even thinking about it. 
And when I found thai fans typing 55555, I didn't know what it meant. Later I found that 5 reads ""ha"" in Thai, and 5555 means hahahaha. International interaction that is happening in Kpop communities could be quite interesting, I think. And I wonder what kind of vocabulary you have caught either in Korean or in other countries in kpop communities. Or, I wonder what words you get to know because of BTS. For example, I guess Hyung &amp; Maknae is one of those words that you can't be unaware of if you are an army. ",89,56,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure whether BTS have simply stopped promoting on Show Champion (since they weren't there last week either, but did promote on Music Core), or if Music Core on 161029 was their Goodbye stage. The compilation posts on the main kpop subreddit don't specify the types of stages anymore, and the MBC YouTube videos don't specify Goodbye stages.

This is the link to [the petition](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/589/324/503/demand-%22blood-sweat-tears%22-by-bts-be-played-on-the-radio/) for anyone who hasn't signed it. It seemed like the majority of us did not take much notice or attention to this project at that time, which kinda made me sad, really. 


But the project has started giving positive results! Firstly, we have nearly accomplished half of the seemingly impossible goal of gathering 50,000 signatures so far. ARMYs from around the world have learned about this and taken every measure to make more people sign this petition. I remembered reading one comment, an American ARMY performed street dancing with BS&amp;T as background music, and he asked spectators of his performance to take interest in this project and give it one signature. K-ARMYs have been informed about this project also, that's why their names usually flood the petition board everyday at 10-11pm KST. Secondly, **we have 5 major US radio stations interested in seeing it**. Now, we need to accomplish one more thing to get Blood, Sweat and Tears played on U.S radio! **It's basically create mass request consistently for BS&amp;T on these stations.** The request must be made by American listeners, so the participation of **U.S. ARMYs** this time would be the key factor to this project's success. 


Instruction to create mass request is here: https://goo.gl/3vZbiX


As I don't live in the U.S, I don't really know which twitter accounts or sites U.S. ARMYs usually follow, or which public sites which we can call on mass attention to this project from local bystanders, but I really want to contribute something to the project, so I have virtually spammed the link above on any BTS-related sites, including this community. I really thing there is a high chance for the dream of hearing Bangtan's music on the radio to become a reality. Moreover, think about the massive public exposure Bangtan would get; it could help get BS&amp;T get into Hot100, help BTS gain more international recognition, and undoubtedly the domestic respect for artists they deserve. 


So if you are U.S ARMYs, or have been friends with several of them or simply just know where on the Internet they usually gather, please participate in spreading the words and the actions! If you are not, I think we can contribute differently to this project. We've come so far now! Let's not let our endeavors be wasted! Thank you!

[Today's Lineup](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwTS5p5VEAAl30I.jpg).
BTS got 72.4% of the pre-vote.

I only missed the Inkigayo special episode and I actually feel some withdrawal going on. Bless our poor souls. At least the big Muster fan meets are next weekend!

Six Months Later,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5ax8kd/has_your_top_ten_changed_six_months_later/,amandapearl2,1478185767,"Six months ago we discussed our [top 10 bangtan songs](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/4hw9jv/so_has_your_top_ten_changed/) when Young Forever came out.  Now that we've all digested Wings has your rankings changed?  (Man and I thought having 3 new songs was bad enough lol).

**1.  Save Me**  I think this has bumped up to the top spot for me.  It's by far my favorite song they've released this year, and might even be my favorite song of 2016?  


**2.  What am I to You**  This is still my favorite rap from bangtan, but my love of it has risen even higher if that's possible.  This is just so damn relatable for me, it feels very personal.


**3.  Dope**  My introduction to BTS, I can't imagine it will never be in my top 10.


**4.  Blood Sweat &amp; Tears**  I Need U was my favorite title track, but BST has taken that spot.  This track is 100% my musical taste and I love the upgraded and mature styling.


**5.  Awake**  I went back and forth for a while but I think Awake is my favorite solo from wings.  The lyrics are so heartbreaking and I just really love Jin a whole lot.  I need more Jin singing like this in my life.


**6.  Move**  I have seen the light on this song.  J-hope's verse kills me every time, his voice is so lovely.  


**7.  Run Ballad Ver.** I love this version so much, it's one of my favorite songs on Young Forever I'm so happy it was included.  


**8.  Hold Me Tight** This is back on my list in a big way after getting bumped last time.  It's hard for me to express what I love about this song, it's just so good.


**9.  Butterfly**  One of their prettiest songs ever.  I don't know why my top 10 is so full of ballads!  I like upbeat music I swear.


**10.  Cypher Pt. 3**  Six months ago I said ""I would kill to see this live, I'm sure it's unreal.""  Well I have seen this live, and it is unreal.  I still can't believe that really happened. One of the best concert experiences of my life.




Songs that were bumped from the last top 10 are I Need U, Young Forever, War of Hormone, and Nevermind.  I'm ok with most of that.  I wish I had a spot for Lies, but I can't figure out where I would put it.  Probably #11.  

So how did Wings shake up your top ten?  Please tell me!  (I'm sure my list will change in a week lol, picking a top 10 for bangtan is like trying to pick a bias for bangtan).

So i'm very new to kpop. I only started listening a month ago, with the release of Wings, which happens to personally be my album of the year. Recently I've gone back and listened to the rest of BTS's work and love nearly all of it. Any recommendations for groups that have a similar style to Bangtan? I'm a fan of the hip hop/R&amp;B sound they have (I was orignally turned off by kpop because I, very ignorantly, assumed it was all bubblegum pop type stuff). 

If it helps with giving recommendations, here's some other stuff I've listened to and liked:

EXO - Lucky One

EXO - Call Me Baby

EXO - Thunder

(EXO songs are hit or miss with me, but i really like those.)

SHINee - Odd the 4th album

Dalshabet - FRI. SAT. SUN. (i heard this on Music Bank last night and loved it.)

And that's really all I've listened to haha. There are so many groups and artist I really don't know where to continue, so any help/discussion is appreciated! I can't believe I've spent my whole life missing out on so much good music lol",22,18,False,self,,,,,

The main guide link *""welcome, first time with BTS?""* is now in the header at the top and one of the first things you see when landing on the page (one less sticky post!).

Now, I'm far from a CSS expert and mainly just winged it since I'm still learning, so I'm creating this post to let you all know and to ask for **some feedback**.

**If you find any errors or annoying things happening, please let me know so I can fix it.**

If there's anything you think I can improve, please say so!

I would also like to thank the mod team for letting me help. It was fun \^\^

Their idol interacts with them a lot  and their company helps their artist to interact with the fans. This makes me really jealous
I was watching Inkigayo to see Black Pink's performance and heart boy scouts  I heard that they always make hearts during their goodbye stage  they upload videos regularly and I heard that their fans get nervous when BTS members don't tweet for a day  I'm jealous
I can feel their love for their fans from their nickname ""heart boy scouts""

Not a day has gone by before this non-ARMY's sentiments were validated by the latest bomb being released literal minutes ago, and in a few hours, Starshow 360. I am so grateful for Bighit's business sense towards us. And even under all the industrialized strategies of packed schedules, pushing out multiple albums and concerts a year, etc., I never fail to sense a genuine care for the boys' well-being at all times.

**UPDATE: Thank you, everyone&lt;333 It's solved! Apparently they just shipped out my order hours after I opened this thread and finally after 28 days of waiting. Fingers crossed that it will indeed arrive now Dx **

---------------------------------------------------------------

Wanted to ask for some advice because this is a really frustrating experience. 

I've ordered a BTS BOTTLE[ZIPCODE:22920] on **October 12** when it was **still in stock** and am still **waiting for it to be even shipped out** and it's almost a whole month now. I also did it on the English website not the Korean one. They also took the money for the product + shipping from my credit card already.

I've contacted their Q&amp;A/customer support on **October 17** because the status of my order said ""product sourcing"" and the next day they told me they would give me a tracking number.

On **October 25** they finally gave me a tracking number which I then tried to track via Korea EMS every single day and every time it says that the shipping number can't be found. I was confused and checked the delivery status on the website again and it was updated to **send standby** which I assume means they haven't send it out and are waiting for something.

On **November 1** , I then wrote another Q&amp;A ticket and a direct email to their customer support. No response. 
On **November 5** , I then checked their website and lo and behold, the bottle is now listed as **Sold out** like.... whaaat??!!
I opened another ticket and they didn't read it yet again. 

It's been now almost 30 days and it's so frustrating because I had this item shipped to my friend's house for her birthday which was on the 25th of October and now not only is it too late but it might not arrive at all T_____T

Has anyone else had any experiences or similar ones with the shop? Do you guys think that I should do a chargeback seeing as they never shipped out my order, put it on sold out without informing me and don't respond to tickets?


P.S. Gift was supposed to be shipped to Japan so even if they shipped it out, it wouldn't take that long from South Korea to Japan.",7,8,False,self,,,,,

**ARTICLE**

**It was a hectic one-month long parade. After releasing their second album ""WINGS"" on October 10th, seven-member idol group BTS shook US Billboard chart and many other international music charts. From overseas to Korea, their achievements were bigger than an actual victory. BTS was the first Korean singer to debut at #26 on ""Billboard 200"" (album chart). Billboard 200 ranks the albums based on the overall quality of the album. and in 2014 girl group 2NE1 set the highest record by ranking at #61. Billboard published several articles focusing on ""Bangtan phenomena"" and said, ""BTS hit a new land for the scene with no songs in English, no U.S promotion."". BTS ranked No. 6 on Youtube Music Global Top 100 Artist chart (October 7th~13th). They scored higher than Australian singer-songwriter Sia (8th) and Ariana Grande (9th).**



Is BTS starting a new chapter of K POP in their 4th year? We asked the secret to global popularity to the seven BTS members and Bighit Entertainment CEO Bang Sihyuk who produced the group in Seoul Nonhyeon-dog Practice room.



There were several suitcases lying around BTS's practice room. This proved the busy schedules of 4th-year idol group who travel around the world, competing with global singers. There was a massage chair in one corner of the room. This chair was used by Jimin before we began the interview and they said it was a gift they received from Naver. It was a prize for reaching 3,360,000 followers on Naver V App which also meant they had the most number of followers. 



Rap Monster (22), Suga (23), Jin (24), J Hope (22), Jimin (21), V (21), and Jungkook (19). The seven-member group BTS has an extraordinary communication strategy. They show their fans their cool image on stages and they regularly reveal their moments behind the stage. They regularly uploaded short videos, ""Bangtan Bomb"" ever since their debut days on their Youtube channel. These videos captured the daily lives of members at the waiting room, dorm, playing around at their practice room and the members also spoke about their concerns.



**BTS was formed with the concepts like your next door oppa, younger brother, or someone like your friend, ""Let's become a hero who people can lean on and not an idol group who is like a fake idol."".  Member Suga said, ""We didn't exaggerate or hide our personalities, instead we continued uploading our true selves on Youtube and SNS. Our company didn't ask us to create them, we created these videos because we wanted to and we enjoy making them.""**




The members have been living together for 7 years since their trainee days and their candid personalities excited the fans from around the world in real time. BTS' ""push and pull"" skill is outstanding, they're like a celebrity to their fans but they're also like their friends. Rap Monster added, ""BTS is the group that benefited the most from media. When we begin our live broadcast on Naver V App, even fans from Brazil can watch us in HQ in real time so I think we have the means to promote globally and not just in Korea."". They chose to build their fandom by communicating with global fans on SNS, taking a step further than their senior K-POP idols who release their songs to the fans around the world via Youtube. 



**They didn't become popular immediately after their debut. Many people expressed how childish their group name ""BTS"" sounded. They cowered because they weren't from the big entertainment companies.**



""Before our debut, I went to a senior's concert with Suga, Jungkook, and J Hope. The concert was held at Gymnastics Arena in Seoul Jamsil and on our way home after the concert, we all said, ""I wouldn't want anything more if we get to perform at such place."". But we did perform at the Arena last May. Our idea turned into a reality."" (Rap Monster)



**During their early debut days, Suga, Rap Monster, and J Hope were the members who usually created their music. But all members participated in making of their new album. ""Inspiring each other"" wasn't something they said for the sake of formality. Youngest member Jungkook said, ""I began to naturally learn since all of them (older members) make music."". Jimin said, ""The older members made me realize that making music is enjoyable.""**



BTS's music is a series of storytelling. They released ""School trilogy"", ""Youth trilogy"" and other series albums and they picked the story of youth as their topic. They don't just talk about the beauty of youth but they also approached things like ""school violence"", ""entrance exams"" and ""spine breaker"". Suga said, ""We tried our best to talk about relatable stories and stories we can share with people around our age."". He continued, ""The pain or unstableness of youth, we captured things like the flaws in the present situation."".



**Their honest stories worked in the other countries too. In the Billboard column which  analyzed BTS's popularity secret, they stated,  The group blends individual artistry, which is what the U.S. audience expects in their music, and the K-pop system, which focuses more on the group sound and teamwork, BTS has something to say, and has a great marketing strategy that doesnt alienate non-Korean-speaking fans..**



After their school and youth series, BTS expressed the temptation/conflicts faced by youths in their new album. Their title track ""Blood Sweat &amp; Tears"" was inspired by Hermann Hesse's novel ""Demian"". The music video of this song reached 40 million views in just 3 weeks. If so, what could be the biggest temptation faced by BTS who maintains hectic schedule every day? The seven lips replied with one voice. It was the sound of youths in the 20s.



""We don't know if we should get more sleep or we should do something else. Would it be a better idea to sleep 4 hours instead of 5 and then spend an hour cleaning my room? ah, I have to diet too and that's also my concern.""",13,70,False,self,,,,,

As a reading enthusiast I was encouraged to see one of the maknae lines reading, something I'd expect more from Rapmon or Suga. [So recently it was identified that Park Jimin was reading the popular Korean light novel series called Legendary Moonlight Sculptor.](https://mobile.twitter.com/gvannyyg/status/763066676971761664) So I got curious and downloaded the english translations. I don't usually read manga or light novels, classics and contemporary are more of my thing but damn this is quite a fun read. Now I'm on the 9th book and nothing's stoping me lol. There's currently 48 books all in all and each book is about 300 pages long. However it's a very easy read and it's really fast paced and filled with interesting events so you won't be bored. It's very similar to Sword Art Online if you're familiar with that and also with Ready Player One. The story is about a Korean dude named Lee Hyun, a hardworking young man suffering from a life of poverty. Forced to work throughout his childhood and adolescence, his most redeeming trait is his perseverance. His tenacity is reflected in a once immensely popular game called Continent of Magic. A game in which his character is undisputed as the absolute best. When he decides to focus on working, he sells his character online, and sparks a bidding war that concludes at 3,090,000,000 won (about 3,000,000 usd). As soon as he finds out, nearly all the money Lee Hyun earns is taken by debt collectors. This triggers him to vows to single-mindedly devote himself to making money in the new virtual reality game, Royal Road. The start is somewhat cringey and very dramatic in the exaggerated Korean way, but once the story unfolds and the game starts it's very hard to put down. Anyway just wanna recommend it here for the people who might be interested. It's a really enjoyable series and it's an added bonus that Jimin reads this as well.

&gt; Originally when I first got into them *i thought they were pretty cool* as Dope was the first MV I watched and remember thinking ""they seem really cool omg I'll watch more"" and I began to start watching all the bangtan bombs but for some reason I felt odd doing so?? like I've never had a problem watching YouTubers but for some reason watching them not on stage and being themselves was really odd for me because I guess my mind was just like still seeing them in their onstage personas. But then the more I got comfortable watching them gradually realised they are honestly a bunch of dorks who are pretty extra but have so so much love for not only their fans but also each other. As I gradually got to know them more it honestly was really heartwarming (and still is). The same thought process was implied on each member too lol

I clicked because Kookie was on the thumbnail. It was good, and i'm happy that they got the teens to watch such a beautifully made music video. What I feel they didn't exactly get was the whole mainstream thing. 

Let's say you have this awesome bike, it's this cool shade of electric blue, and has neon green handlebars. The bike is so cool that you want to show it too your friends. So you take it to school one day, and everyone sees it. And within the next month, a lot of people at your school have the exact same bike. It's not as special or as meaningful as it was when you first got it. 

Not in all cases, but with some things, when a lot of people like it, it looses its charm. And we are afraid we won't get the same enjoyment we once had. I have nothing but love for BTS, but I kinda understand the whole ""too mainstream"" argument. Though on the other hand, I'm super happy that BTS is getting the recognition that they have worked so hard for and totally deserve. I feel that the Fine Bros didn't understand the other side of the argument.

So like a rapidly growing fan base is kinda new for me because the music I've listened to has already run it's course (it's not as popular as let's say BST). So it's like a new feeling I guesswhere it's like I know they're popular (like The Beatles) but in a different way than I'm used to. So I guess that's kinda what's making me feel all possessive and stuff (if this makes sense to any of you). ",13,0,False,self,,,,,

I personally don't use KakaoTalk that much, but I know you can use it both on your phone (for when you're on the go) and on a computer, which is really convenient!

I've been part of a KIK group for a while (me and 5 other people) and it's been really fun sharing BTS memes, pics, and news. We talk almost every day about funny things they did, what was cute, and we thirst a lot lol. We go on a separate website from time to time and watch BTS/kpop youtube vids together. I like our group dynamic. :D

I was thinking if /r/Bangtan users would also like to get together do something similar? 

Not all of us here have to be in the same group, people can form their own chat groups. People can list their username and interests so like-minded people can add each other! 

**If you have a KIK or a Kakao (or both) and would like to form a group, post here**, yes? :)

Possible chat preferences: if you like talking about ships, sharing cute/dorky/cool pics of the members, sharing news, memes, etc.

(Also with any free-talk platform, please don't release extremely personal information out! Leave the chat, mute it, and/or block if you start getting uncomfortable.)

I don't think this question has been asked before on this sub so imma ask it here!

I was talking to my ARMY friend the other day, and she was telling me that she watches all the individual fancams of each member after a performance. Well, this made me feel a bit guilty because I only ever watch my bias' (Jimin) and my bias wreckers' (Yoongi &amp; Jungkook) fancams. Sometimes I tap into Taehyung's and Namjoon's fancams if I felt like their performances stood out to me that day - and this happened a lot during WINGS era. 

However, I have to confess that I've only watched 1 or 2 Jin's fancams, and this was from the FIRE era where he looked positively surreal.

I've watched the legendary fancams of other members, like Jimin's perfect man fancam, Hobi's NMD dance break, Taehyung's Tomorrow fancam, etc etc. So now I want to indulge myself in Jin cams. 

Are there 'legendary' Jin fancams that I should see? Please share it with me!

I am normally a lurker on this subreddit, but I thought I would be able to share a glimpse into the fan meeting that happened yesterday night in Fukuoka. I am an American working in Japan.

I was nearby the stage in the third row in the stands so I had an overall good view of what happened. The goods were train-themed and with pink and light blue coloring. Compared to a BIGBANG fan meeting I went to earlier this year (I am VIP and ARMY), the merchandise line wasn't as crazily long (but then again they hardly advertised the goods on the BTS fan club site). For BIGBANG, I waited 2.5 hours for goods - for BTS, literally 5 mins. Might be because I got there about 2 hours before the arena opened.

I have a terrible memory for everything, but I will tell you what games and what songs they performed.

The first number was ""FOR YOU"" and they were wearing cream-colored trench coat outfits. After performing, they entered a quiz corner about which member knows JUNGKOOK the most. Kookie was in charge of the points given for each answer and you could tell he was screwing around (went from 500 to 5,000 to 50,000 to 60,000). Jimin won and got the answers to all of them correctly. 

The awkward thing about these Japanese fan meetings is wondering if they are understanding what is going on or being able to answer things. They did have a Korean interpreter offstage but the boys would sometimes talk over each other crazily and it would just be pure chaos at times so all you can do is laugh. Since I am not a native speaker of Japanese, watching them try so hard to speak Japanese was endearing. Jimin never gave up on trying to communicate and kept speaking Japanese even if it would've been easier speaking in Korean - which I can highly appreciate. 

It basically felt like AHL Part Japan Version with some of the cringey Japanese said at times, haha. Jin would say stuff and then be confused and throw out kisses or hearts or winks, for example. At one point, the question was about something kookie was embarrassed about and it was when kooki and Jin were messing around on stage and they got yelled at by Jimin or something and Jin was totally like ""I don't remember"" - I don't know if that is the case or if the Japanese was too confusing....(? I remember reading this somewhere)

Also, first thing kookie does in the morning is look for something to eat and Jimin demonstrated a funny walk to the fridge. The teasing was relentless.

Also V was adorable. Suga was the perfect grandpa and yelling a lot of JHOOOOOOOPE and Hobi was always trying his hardest to entertain the crowd and Namjoon was such a ""SENSEI"" (he spoke very calm and nicely in Japanese while the others were a bit all over the place - not a bad thing)

After the quiz corner, they performed acoustic renditions of some songs like Boy in Luv and Danger. To confirm, yes Jin did play the guitar at the beginning of boy in Luv but when it was Danger, he wasn't playing anymore, I can't tell if it was for real or whatever, but it was neat. Before this, Kookie and Rapmon performed a duet together as well.

There was then a performance of 21st century girls which made me the happiest fan girl ever. Only disappointing part was I think the Japanese fans did not understand the whole ""raise your hands up"" and ""now scream"" ;~; one of the fans next to me ended up being a Korean and she seemed to know. Phew!

After this, they were tasked with going to different parts of the stage to complete certain tasks. One was a corner where Hobi had to feel things in a box and then draw what was inside and the other members had to guess it correctly. They passed - even though Hobi drew a weird dog.

The other game was where they had to say a Hakata dialect tongue twister. Jimin is very confident in his Hakata-Ben skills, but he was deemed too slow. Yoongi was all like ""Fuck this I'm outtie"". Namjoon tried but stil was deemed too slow.

So they had to play another game and that was basically they were forced to do a random song dance challenge from their previous tour. There was a bit of Tomorrow in there and I was super excited, lol. They also did 3x speed of BST. 

And then a marathon comedian named Neko Hiroshi came bursting out during FIRE. And they were tasked with doing a tied-leg race. The Neko team won (Kookie, Hobi, and Jin), so the losing team had to wear cat ears and tails during the performance of Fun Boys. It was glorious. 

After that, Yoongi and Hobi came out in sparkly blazers and sung to Otsukaresama deshita. It was so cheesy and amazing. Danced in the stands as well.

After that....oh dear. ;~; trying to remember. (fan meeting was almost 3 hours)

But they changed into outfits for Baepsae and FIRE (and the outfits looked very BST). After they finished FIRE, they were breathing really heavily and talked a bit with the crowd about their impressions and whatnot as well as the WINGs album. Kookie said some obviously memorized phrase in a cheesy way and Jimin and Hobi danced around in a circle and made Kookie say his phrase like 3 times. After that, they were like ""I am sure you have been waiting to hear this."" And it went dark. Fans were super excited and squealing, 

And then it was a different sounding song as they walked together to the center stage. Lol. Fans next to me were like ""da duck is this this?""
But I heard that weird like hoooooo sound and knew BST was next.

The lighting was beautiful. Reds at points with V and Jimin shoulder parts. It was so good. They then announced they would sing their last song, ""Miss Right"" and they walked around waving and yeah.

Then they left. People were chanting for them. I saw the screen with the lyrics on the stage for them and it said Encore in English and I told the nearby Jaoanese fans I was fangirling with that they'd come out again. And most likely in the nearby aisle. Japanese fangirl was like ""HELL NO""

But bam, I was right! They came out in little choo-choo trains and threw balls into the stands. I got to see V, Yoongi, Namjoong, and Jimin up close. They were very handsome. Unfortunately, I don't remember what song they were singing while this was happening. I think I was too focused on trying to catch a ball. Or being mesmerized.

They then performed an encore song to Young Forever and there was tons of confetti in the air. Love that song a lot so was super happy.

They gave their thoughts and thanks and loads of hearts and kisses and blah blah. And left after waving a ton.

Some thoughts: Namjoon was very kind and told everyone to sit down during some of the chat corners. At the BIGBANG fan meet, they did not tell people to sit down. Even though they had a special guest, the focus was not on the special guest the whole time and it was a lot of physical humor and fun. BIGBANG fan meet had some mentalist or whatever and it was soooooo tiresome. Lastly, BTS kept saying they love ARMY and I realized something. They didn't say I love Japanese ARMY. They said ARMY. BIGBANG is always like I love Japan (or whatever city they are in). I may be overthinking it but it makes me happy for them to say ARMY. International ARMY and Korean ARMY are one.

The fans were great and lovely to talk with. No pushing or shoving. There were also loads of families who came. I saw a lot of boys and young men as well. I talked with a Kookie and Namjoon fan and she was super amused by the coconuts image (when we were waiting for the concert to begin, they play a bunch of music videos and they were showing FIRE). And to compare with BIGBANG fans again, BIGBANG fans are all decked out in official concert goods and clothing, but BTS fans were in all different manners of dressing (some had official hoodies), but a lot of people were wearing personal street wear looks. I always felt intimidated by BIGBANG fans (even though I have shirts and whatnot), but I didn't feel that way with BTS fans. They were very welcoming and nice.

/u/iamnothyper gave us a suggestion of having our header like the one in /r/kpop where it changes the picture every time you refresh the page, so we're here today to ask for the help of our more creative ARMYs who'd like to collaborate to create cool headers for the sub.

It would be cool to have headers representing each of Bangtan's era so far (as suggested by /u/dorkprincess), so that's what we're focusing in. You can either submit a single one, three or all the eras. As many as you want, really.

In case you guys would like to participate, there's a few things you have to be mindful of:

1. The WINGS logo in the middle;
2. The colour scheme of the sub (has to match the emblem in the sidebar);
3. The height has to be 260px and 800px width so it'd be able to fit even in small screens;

I'll later fade the end of the header so it won't look awkward in the bigger screens, like how our current header fades to black to the right. We'll be choosing the best ones to use, so please post them in this thread!

Thanks for your time, and have a lovely day~",36,32,False,self,,,,,

When I got back, the post was gone.  I know that can be hard sometimes - especially in a sub like this that's blown up so much - you put yourself out there hoping someone will comment and... crickets (because my selfish ass was watching Neon Demon! ahhhhh!!!).    

Luckily this ain't this old woman's first time at this style of rodeo *(guess who got interviewed by the Boston Globe back in 1999 for being one of the ""original"" internet fans of The Blair Witch Project that helped it blow up - but I digress seeing that you probably weren't even born yet)* so I wanted to catch you here if I could.
    
Please know - I think what you did was completely rad, and the fact that the radio station liked your tweet was EVEN better.  Fans like you are the reason why BTS is getting so much attention for breaking records on the charts!!  They were writing about you honey!!  So next time you're excited about it and want to tell us here, please don't get discouraged and delete that post, just give us some time to see it - I promise I'm checking ""New"" as much as I can and I know others are too.    
    
This band will only get bigger which means we - as the ARMY they love so much - will just work harder to support each other, making sure everyone is  safe and accounted for.  This way we can ALL celebrate together as our boys climb higher *with us right behind them*.

Compared to their 2nd Muster at Hwajung Gymnasium with about 6000 fans - proud is an understatement)! I, like many other fans, tracked a lot of what was happening through periscope, fancams and translations, but I'm sure a lot of people weren't able to do the same so I thought I could compile a little list of videos from the show in a vaguely chronological order to keep everything sort of organised and available to anyone who wants it :) (If there's anything I've missed out or put in the wrong place, feel free to add things in the comments and I'll try to edit the post!)

This one --&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5cibh8/weekly_rbangtan_room_%EB%B0%A9%ED%83%84%EB%B0%A9_november_12_2016/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link 

It has been a very interesting discussion so I thought I should create a thread for it!

For everyone's convenience, I'll paste some of the content here:

The **flavor** of  BTS voices according to /u/seira_san (me):

* Jin's voice is like Strawberry Milk. Sweet, light, and it comforts you on a cold and lonely night T_T
* Suga's voice is like Japanese Sake lol. His voice doesn't match his face at all. It's deep, loud and clear.
* J-Hope's voice is like orange fanta. He got this fizzy, crunchy texture (?) quality on his voice especially when he raps in Cypher Pt 3
* RM's voice is like coffee. When he raps it's espresso, when he sings it's ice coffee! His voice is so deep and manly
* Jimin's is like Milk Tea. It's light and high just like Jin's but it's more velvety
* Tae's voice is like chocolate. Deep and comforting T_T and sometimes sexy or even fun! Chocolate is suitable for all kinds of occasion, no?
* JK's voice is like sparkling mineral water. Loud and clear with occasional fizzy (?) texture.



The **color and texture** of BTS' voice according to /u/lithiam:

* jin: the way i see jin's voice is like a gradient of light blues, grays and pinks.
* suga's is like grays and blacks and whites in wall - like the pattern a cat makes when it scratches the wall with it's claws. normally my head prefers more soothing/clear (like glass looking) voices, but somehow i love his voice deeply. sometimes i see fur. like cat fur?
* jhope is hard for me to pinpoint, because i keep seeing different colors when i listen to him, but there's mostly a deep red (a bit lighter than wine?) as the background and splaches of different colors everywhere. one of the weirdest looking voices i've ever heard haha
* rm is a grayish dark purple/grayish mauve. when he speaks english i see some green too. interesting pallete.
* jimin!! his voice are lots of light tones in shades of blue/lilac. and i see the patterns very very faded. it's kind of the aftermath of when you pour milk in a bowl? when the milk is almost stopping. tiny little waves.
* tae is green, moss, brown. always warm tones. i see curves.
* jk's is beautiful. when it's caramel it has lovely tones of honey. there are other colors too but those are the ones that appear the most.

I'm currently sitting in my apartment still in a daze over the past two days. This was my second/third time seeing them and this weekend pretty much confirmed why I love them. WARNING: I'm gonna be mentioning Namjoon at the end. I'm also not gonna get in depth with the performances and what not. 

**SATURDAY:**

I got to the Dome around noon-ish and stayed towards the subway exit waiting for a now friend who was coming up from a different part of the country. She was sitting over in the 100s while I was all the way up in the sky...I mean section 415. When she got there, we went and got our tickets, got some snacks, sat and talked, and then went into the venue. 

I was able to see pretty well even though I was in row R. No one was sitting next to me so I pretty much had room on both sides and it was great. In general, Saturday for me was just focusing on what was happening around me. The Q&amp;A part was hilarious even though I had no idea what was being said. The mission part was so great I was dying. We stan children. Honestly. The little unit stages were basically me sobbing but I'll talk about those for Sunday. 

I will never not get over how the place erupted when Dope started followed by Fire. I was having KCON NY flashbacks in the best way. BUT BLOOD SWEAT TEARS. OH MY GOD. [clutches pillow] That is art! ART I TELL YOU! 

Now, the speeches, which happened after we lifted the banner signs and the boys basiclaly had to take a moment to process everything. OH LORDY THE SPEECHES. Like speeches already are emotional but let's talk about Taehyung and Jungkook. This is my Facebook status: 

&gt; What she says: I'm fine.

&gt; What she means: Kim Taehyung who is the light of my life cried during his speech when he mentioned his grandmother passed away a few days after our Golden Maknae's birthday. He was mourning the entire promotional period and was dealing with issues from antis spreading false information and the like about him. Kim Taehyung who works his heart out cried but said that ARMY keeps him going. Then when our beautiful Golden Maknae, Jeon Jungkook had his turn he started crying right away. Our Golden Maknae who works so hard when he thinks he is lacking talent (he isn't) and feels like he constantly bothers his hyungs since he is the youngest (he isn't) and tries to make it so they never have to worry about him (oh my baby no honey stop). BTS why are you doing this to my heart??? This was only day one! I have tomorrow as well. 

THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE AT ALL! People were yelling in sadness. My heart. 

**SUNDAY:**

This day was way better because of many reasons. [Besides making friends with another person randomly and hanging out with them until I went inside.] I got to the Dome around 8:30 and went to the Express Goods line because I just really needed to have an ARMY Bomb and a slogan banner. I was one of the first 20 in line. 

Today in general was like this wonderful realization about how wonderful ARMY is. I was surrounded by ARMY today compared to yesterday. There was a girl two seats down from me who was basically yelling at Namjoon the entire time like me. Nmajoon doing aegyo. Jungkook showing off his strength. JUST END ME. 

They were all so extra today and I mean *extra*. They were in this wonderful mood and I was so happy. Everyone was so happy. And by the end it was just this wonderful little celebration of love. There were no tears tonight. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. 

Okay. Now it's Namjoon time. He's my bias after the Great Bias Crisis of September happened in which I had bias changes in a lot of my favorite groups. But Namjoon. There's just something about him. The yells for him were amazing. Just amazing. Coming from I-fandom, Rap Mon usually isn't the top bias for a lot of my friends. A friend of mine literally directed me to the Namjoon path. There would be now BTS without Namjoon. I will tell people that until the day I die honestly. This boy has worked his way up my all time bias list to top 5 territory and that is hard to make. My focus was mainly on him as well. [Except today Hoseok was trying to bias wreck me. This is why I have to say my bias is Namjoon and then BTS. BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.]  I mean, he took off his jacket and I basically lost my voice screaming. 

Watching Namjoon I could just tell how much he loves being on that stage with his members performing for us. I can tell by how hard he works that he doesn't want to let us down. HE WILL EVEN DO EMBARRASSING AEGYO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE WANT IT. Namjoon is so important oh my god. Namjoon is truly a light in this dark world and I will always wonder how we even got him because we don't deserve him. 

Anyway, I am now becoming to incoherent. This is what this group does to me though. Coherency does not exist in Bangtan world. I'm gonna be in a daze for a while. The Bangtan Effect is real.

Firstly, to all Hobi stans, I am so sorry for sleeping on him since I became a fan 2014. Actually, J Hope and V first attracted me to BTS during Just One Day era. But as time went on I kind of just biased V and didn't pay much attention to Hobi (I'M SORRY I WAS WRONG ;;). But then a bunch of events transpired (listed below) and now I'm a full blown Hope stan.

1. After I saw their  (move? moving on?) performance from HYYH live on stage... I was so shook by Hope's expression and feeling that he put in the song, I just wow.. no words...
2. His verse from  (dead leaves, i think? autumn leaves?) shook me again for the second time
3. Young Forever Epilogue, his whole verse, but especially this part - 'Even if the attention isnt forever, Ill keep singing. I want to stay this way for life, I want to stay young forever AHH' = shook for the third time
4. 2! 3! oh don't even get me started.. 'So thanks for becoming my light, for becoming the flower in the most beautiful moment in life'... shook for the fourth time, shook forever

Anyway, there are many more times/songs than this, but these are just what made me a Hope stan. Basically I just love J Hope so much because of his way with words and his delivery and how he expresses himself in the songs and on stage. Even though he didn't join Bighit with the intention of becoming a rapper, I think he does a pretty freaking great job at it ;; Not to mention his personality, just wow brighter than the actual sun and stars. AND HIS DANCING i'm not gonna start, u all already know. I'm just ahh ;; wow I can't believe he's one of the least popular members ;;; ((I appreciate u J Hope x3245239)). But mhmm, although he's not as poetic as Rapmon, and his style of rapping isn't as rap influenced/rap-heavy(?) as Suga's, his lyrics and the way he delivers them just really gets me ;;; 

So I know I'm not the only one that feels this way as I've seen many comments on Youtube praising Hope for his unique rapping style, so I wanna ask what are some of your personal favourite J Hope lyrics/parts/songs/whatever??

TL;DR - I'm shook by J Hope, please appreciate him with me because I don't know any Hope stans and I just want everyone to know how awesome he is ;;;


Edit: wow I'm giddy with happiness just reading all these and I'm not even J Hope. I think my heart would burst if I was him reading such beautiful words about myself ;; I hope he knows that so many of us love and appreciate him for so many different reasons :3 (and the other members too ofc!)",50,107,False,self,,,,,

So I have never been that active on Twitter, but made a revival recently for the sole purpose of keeping up with BTS related things. So far I have followed a handful of accounts I could stumble upon: the official of course, a couple of translators, some random Hobi accounts that are all in Korean but post a lot of pretty pictures of him, and a few funny ones I found people linking elsewhere (vminissi, JudgementalBts, BTSgoogling and btsbeingbts).

Would you happen to have recommendations for some other accounts worth following? It can be useful or funny or otherwise great content! Hoseok is my thing but my #2 is pretty much everyone else, so other member specific stuff is welcome too~

If it's inappropriate for the subreddit, please let me know and I'll delete it. I suppose this is a bit of a clarification post on the MMA awards, and to also rebut arguments made in certain posts. I'm posting this here, because I can't think of other places to post it (and also, I don't know how to use OneHallyu etc.) and because I felt it needed to be said. Please note that this thread is only using sales figures as a point of comparison and is not intended to be taken as criticism. 

[This post](http://pann-choa.blogspot.com.au/2016/11/enter-talk-melon-album-of-year-exo-and.html) has been making the rounds. To start with the [third image](http://thumb.pann.com/tc_480/http://fimg4.pann.com/new/download.jsp?FileID=38574891), which was linked in the translated comments, it is misleading to use for Album of the Year comparisons, because clearly (from obvious context regarding the number of sales/streams alone) it includes all the songs sold in the eligibility period ~~from Oct 1 2015 to 30 Sept 2016~~ (please see EDIT 4 for corrected dates of Nov 19 2015 - Nov 3 2016), not just the ones from the eligible albums (as seen in the first two pictures from the post). The criteria for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year are thus probably NOT exactly the same, as some people have been saying; the former probably uses all digital Melon sales/streams, the latter only the ones from the eligible albums, even if it's weighted 70% sales/30% votes in both cases. [please see EDITS 2 and 4 below; it indeed is not all the digital sales of all the albums, but apparently the top 3 albums]

Next, regarding the images regarding streaming figures. Firstly, the images used in the post are extremely misleading without any further context. The [first](http://i.imgur.com/Px7yBTj.jpg) [two](http://i.imgur.com/ERKHvW4.jpg) images only show the streaming data of the albums, and the one for BTS does not include many of the songs on the album. I have compiled the following charts regarding [Young Forever](http://i.imgur.com/pyN75LV.png) and [EX'ACT](http://i.imgur.com/Nn9Tonx.png) to include both download and streaming figures of songs included on those albums only. This is including data from OneHallyu (itself compiled from Gaon) as far back as possible for download figures and extra streaming figures (streaming data was supplied as per the two charts which provided streaming figures only, excluding the data for I Need U streams only). Note that some periods do not have figures available for digital and sales, and are thus not included on the chart; the chart should not be taken to be final, definitive statement as to how much sold. They are estimates based on available charts only. [EDIT 4: these charts were based on outdated information about the eligibility period, but can provide a useful general comparison of the digital sales of YF and EX'ACT only].

Note that we don't know how the sales/streams of the album are weighted (only that it's 70% digital sales and 30% voting) or which of YF's songs were eligible or from which period they were eligible. To that effect, I added sales of all the songs on YF in the eligibility period ~~from 1 Oct 2015 - 30 Sept 2016~~ (see corrections) and also only after the release of YF. In both cases, the downloads in particular compare very favourably (note that we do not have sales records past certain dates), and we have insufficient data for streaming comparisons. For completeness, I also added all of versions of EX'ACT and the repackage LOTTO. 

Another caveat is that MMA is Melon's music awards, and only uses sales from Melon, not other charts. As far as I know, all these figures were compiled using Gaon sales/streams data. This is a minor point, as sales should probably be roughly equivalent in scale across platforms, but should be pointed out for complete clarity.

I don't disagree with the assertion that perhaps MMA should clarify their criteria, but using out of context data to make baseless conclusions does not benefit anyone in any way. 

EDIT: fixed links and grammar, added some sentences for additional clarity

EDIT 2: why is it almost certain that the ArOTY includes all digital sales of the artist and AOTY includes only the sales of the nominated album? For MMA 2015, Big Bang won ArOTY and was nominated for AOTY with M with the [following digital sales](http://imgur.com/VF4lrEJ) during the MMA award period for the MADE series only. If the cumulative sales of all the artists were included in the calculations for the AOTY award, and not just sales for the single album, there is no way that even with 30% votes that any of the other candidates would have had a shot of winning; no other artists came anywhere close to even half of Big Bang's total digital sales during the eligibility period. It would have been impossible for them to have not won AOTY if all their sales were included for the AOTY award calculation, not just M. From here, it might also be possible to extrapolate that downloads and streams are weighted differently, but this is moving into speculation as we don't have firm figures for the sales of the other nominees for the award. [please see EDIT 4 below for clarifications by k-ARMYs regarding this point]

EDIT 3: courtesy of u/iraenas, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/bongi0228/status/800233076743806978) from k-fandom expresses similar kind of clarifications. It is Korean language. 

EDIT 4: [PEACHISODA](http://peachisoda.blogspot.com.au/2016/11/misc-161120-melon-best-album-of-year.html) has translated the tweet above. the tl;dr version is the eligibility period is actually Nov 19 2015 - Nov 3 2016. Apparently up to three albums are counted (in our case, HYYH Pt 2, HYYH: YF and WINGS) from Melon's chart only. That post compares the relative positions on the Melon charts, and notes that BTS only charted out for 4 weeks in the eligibility period, compared to EXO who charted out with 10. 

EDIT 5: It has been made clear in recent days that the criteria for digital sales is internal data that Melon cannot disclose for obvious reasons. These external data compilations are essentially useless, but even from external data, like has been compiled above, it does not support the conclusion that some people want it to support.

i just wanted to share this website with all of you. I just had really great customer service with Hallyumart.com ...and it looks like they have free shipping for a lot of international countries! they sell mostly fashion related stuff and they have BTS related clothing items and some album items .They have beauty products as well. 


i believe this was the ONLY website i could buy BTS puma bogsock related products at a normal USD price... the other websites that i checked were incredibly overpriced and had shipping costs on top.


initially, my country was not showing up as a place that it would ship to...so i emailed them and they got back to me in the same morning! i'm so happy can finally get my hands on BTS puma bogsock now ..yay! initially i thought i wasn't ever able to get it because of the extreme overpricing and shipping + puma was only selling the BTS versions in Korea...

it looks like it's reviews are overwhelmingly positive so far... i will post pictures when it arrives! i hope this helps someone

408,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2016-11-22,2016,11,22,8,5e7hp5,self.bangtan,[BTS Projects]: Announcement - Census 2016 and 'boy meets /r/bangtan' project,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5e7hp5/bts_projects_announcement_census_2016_and_boy/,BTSprojects,1479772588,"**Hi again, /r/bangtan!** 
 
It's been around a year since the last census and the census this year is coming up on 1 Dec. From the feedback from the [discussion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5820a4/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_doing_more/d8wy8se/), there was interest in conducting a census type book for the boys. We have received permission from the mods to run the census this year and as such, to run the **'boy meets /r/bangtan'** project, 2016 edition. In essence, we will be creating a census survey, collating the data and compiling it into a book. This is a project that we hope the whole subreddit can participate in! Full details will be discussed below.  
 
#Why 'boy meets /r/bangtan'?  
 
In many respects, there are limited opportunities for us i-fans to show the ways in which the members have touched and affected the lives of fans all around the world, from different walks of life and circumstances. Through the census and census book project, we feel that even in some small way, we can show the extent of their impact, even if it's just our little community, and share the things that we as a community love about them.  
 
#The census 
 
The census itself will be completely anonymous. The questions have been adapted from the census questions from /r/kpop and the previous census conducted in 2015 on this subreddit. The current list of questions is [**here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-gQQrVHGpcpQ84WfR) and will be asked through Google forms. In summary, there will be the following types of questions: 
 
**Multiple choice or checklist style questions**: (compulsory for responders) 
 
* demographic questions 
* questions relating to discovery and consumption of BTS / kpop 
* questions relating to use of /r/bangtan  
* questions regarding bias and favourite song/album/mv/choreo.  
 
**Short answer questions**: (non-compulsory for responders)  
 
* favourite BTS memory  
* favourite things about BTS and each member
* ~~favourite performances of BTS and each member~~  this question has been moved to the discussion thread, sorry for any confusion or inconvenience. 
 
The style of how each question will be asked is listed in the link above.  
 
The census this year will be run from **0.00 am 1 Dec to 11.59 pm 10 Dec KST**. The results of the census will be posted as soon as possible after analysis of short answer questions. If there is time and interest, correlations and further analytics on the data may be run.   
 
Any questions, comments or other feedback on the census and the questions and their inclusion in the census book would be greatly welcomed and appreciated! We would rather address these issues in advance rather than on the day.  
 
We hope that everyone can participate in answering the census! 
 
#The census book 
 
Note that not all the questions asked in the census will be necessarily included in the census book. For example, we will not include the 'who is your bias' question in the final copy of the book, and we will also truncate the options in the 'how do you obtain BTS music' question, as described in the questions list. The inclusion or exclusion of certain questions in the book is still up for discussion, and we welcome your comments and feedback. In the same sense, note that certain things in the census book may only be released as a ranked list without percentages etc. However, the results of all the census questions will be released separately to the sub (including analysis of the short answer questions). 
 
Otherwise, the content of the census book would consist mainly of the census data, accompanied by illustrations/infographics. We would also like to include some longer responses and comments elaborating on the questions and responses received in the census, so as to provide reasons and commentary as to why we like certain things.  
 
Since the census form itself is not really suited for this kind of submission, and to also credit people without violating the anonymity of the census, we will be running a separate thread for comments that may be included in the book (e.g. why is this your favourite song? Elaborate more on your favourite BTS memory or favourite thing about a member). The thread would be run at the same time as the census (i.e. 0am 1 Dec  11.59pm 10 Dec KST). We would contact you about inclusion of your comment in the book and ask for permission for use, as well as the form you would prefer to be credited in (for both physical and e-book copy, see below).  
 
Our envisaged plan for running the separate thread is to link the thread in the announcement post for the census on 1 Dec. [**Here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-gRjqar2LofgZlifv) is the rough outline of how the thread would be run. 
 
In addition to sending a hard copy version to the boys, we will also provide a e-copy for /r/bangtan. There likely will be some small variations between the two versions, for privacy and other concerns.  
 
#Envisaged layout 
 
The census book will be largely divided into the following content sections: 
 
* Introduction (what is reddit, what is /r/bangtan, why yearly census, brief statement of why we conducted the census book project, what kind of information did we include) 
* Average user profile (snoo in bulletproof vest; maybe a small explanation of snoo)  
* Census data, divided into sections as above (infographics, fun graphs + tables; map for locations; commentary)  
* BTS section (favourite memory/things/performances etc)
* Member specific sections (favourite things/performances etc)
* Closing comments  describing growth of /r/bangtan and BTS in general  
 
#Funding 
 
As we really would like a project that the whole subreddit can participate in, the BTSprojects team has decided that we will cover the price of the book + shipping.  
 
However, if you want to contribute to this project, our PayPal is [here](https://paypal.me/foryoongs/2) and please follow [these procedures](http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png). PLEASE MAKE SURE TO ADD YOUR REDDIT USERNAME AND THE NAME OF THE PROJECT IN THE COMMENTS / NOTES SECTION. To give you guys an example: **u/BTSprojects donating toward the Census book**. We would greatly appreciate any contributions that would be made for this project. 
 
**We would really like to emphasize again that NO financial donation or any other kind of donation is necessary to participate in this project.** Even though donations are appreciated, the BTSprojects team will cover the whole project costs because we really want as many people to participate as possible.  
 
#Illustrations/Art 
 
Our envisaged illustration style for the census book is clean line / ink-style drawings, mostly black and white with a splash of colour. We would love to have the illustrators and fanartists of this subreddit take part, so please PM us if you would like to help out with this project! All kinds of art are accepted (digital, hand-drawn, etc.). [**Here**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-gRuIVgqJABVH9_Fd) is the link to the briefing. *(Note: Link leads to the edited briefing. In the previous one, we made an error and mentioned including the bias question in the book. This is no longer true, bias will not be included in the book. Our apologies for the confusion!)*

Update: [**Here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-gR027oG8AcYbfq5B) is a list of FAQ re: illustrations/art. 
Update 2: ~~We have enough volunteers to start a second round of illustrations! The members that are still available: Namjoon, Jungkook. PM us if you would be interested in illustrating one of them.~~ We are also currently open to accepting ideas for other kinds of illustrations, please PM us. We are also open to a third round of illustrations, if you would like to illustrate a member who is not currently available, please PM us your interest. 

Update 3: We have enough volunteers at the moment to do two full rounds of illustrations! We may start a third round, depending on interest. Please PM your preferences as normal in the following order: 1. MemberA, 2. MemberB, 3. MemberC. We will keep them in mind if there is enough interest for a third round, or if people are unable to finish their works for whatever reason. 

Please note again that we are also currently open to accepting ideas for other kinds of illustrations for us, please PM us with your concept and we'll discuss it from there. 

Please reply to messages as soon as possible! Though we are currently giving dibs on a first come, first served basis, your dibs will be lost if you do not respond within a week after our assignment of members. 
 
#Translation 
 
If you know Korean and are willing / able to translate, we would greatly appreciate any amount of help that you can give! Ideally, we would like to translate at least all the questions and census data, as well as the introduction and conclusion. Please PM us if you are available and would like to help!
 
#Other 
 
If you are available during December and would like to get involved with the project, please send us a PM!

I ordered some t-shirts and other BTS merch, happy and excited to wear them and support BTS but recently I've stumbled upon a lot of posts (I know it has been ongoing for a while, but I never really thought about it until now) about Armies that wear the merch actually being attacked or frowned upon for wearing any BTS merch or showing their fandom, and that most fans try to keep it low-key because of this. That makes me really sad, I don't want to just wait for my Suga jacket to get here just to hang it up in the closet and let it gather dust. I know technically I'm not supposed to care what others think, as long as I am happy, but I do actually worry about getting distasteful or judgmental looks, or even worse. 
And what about Korean fans or Koreans in general when it comes to stuff like this, getting opinions on how they perceive it would be cool too. The term ""koreaboo"" has been used to label a lot of us foreigners who get into kpop and display it, so yeah, I'm just curious about how bad it actually is! I guess this turned into more of a bunch of questions, please guide me fellow Armies! And no matter what, I'll always be a fan and be supportive, I'd never let any amount of hate stop that, the boys are far too precious. ^-^

Well I was just casually listening today and I hear BTS's Blood Sweat and Tears. Kind of internally freaking out. I just need Black Pink to appear and I'm set.
PS: I hope this post doesn't break any rules.

The following is in NO WAY endorsed by the moderators, but would any of you be interested in a meet-up, especially with the world tour on the horizon? As I know no one in real life who is crazy enough about Bangtan to come with me, I'd like to find some potential flight-mates, or if not that, then at least new friends!

Even if you don't reside in central Texas, or even in America, feel free to comment with the country/region/city you're from so you can have people DM you to set up a groupchat/discord/FB group/what-have-you! There, you can gauge interest and discuss logistics for the meet-up, and perhaps even the trip to the upcoming concert!

Given how popular BTS are now (close to EXO level if not more), I wonder how much the boys make a year for all their hard work.

Don't read ahead if it's not. c: or you can...but don't say I din warn ya!

Hello again, I'm back at it again with more questions for this subreddit. (Sorry, I know I've been kinda spamming! But only cuz you guys are so nice and helpful!) 

So, I've been avoiding reading fanfics, as one does when trying to avoid being 100% corrupted (I'm looking at you talented sneaky fanfic authors with a one way ticket to the fiery depths of the underworld, don't worry I'll join you~)
Buuuuut I caved in. Started reading some cute fluff here and there. And the downward spiral began. Dundunduuun. 

I decided to read a fanfic which had (I think?) the highest amount of ""kudos"" (likes?) On Ao3. And it was surprisingly good. I actually cried. ""Trying To Behave"". To give a sort of summary, it was Yoongi/Jimin focused, childhood friends and things go really wrong and terrible things happen to Jimin and yeah anyways. The story is unfinished and doesn't look like the author will continue it, (who knows). But it left me with a huge craving for really good plot fanfics. Which is where, hopefully, you guys can help. 

This fanfic was perhaps not a literary masterpiece, but it seriously fed my hunger for angst, action, tear-jerker, shocking (?) stories. I know there are a lot out there that focus on feelings and ""relationships"" and ""slice of life"" or on the opposite side of the scale, nothing but smut on smut with no plot. But I'm looking for more than that. I liked that this one had a seriously massive and unique (ish) back story for the characters and the events that occurred leaving you in suspense, gasping in shock over how horrible/terrible/scary (I realize this makes me sound sadistic...but I realize it's fiction and I like feeling the feelz~). Something I wanna point out is that I really enjoy realism in stories, accuracy to real life, good portrayals of the emotions and events. So though I understand and respect that some stories don't like including descriptive sex/violence/etc, I find the unfiltered realism of it to be a pretty important element for my personal enjoyment of the story.

*Spoilers for that fanfic incoming, skip this part if you don't want to read.*

What I mean by realism is for example, in this fanfic, Jimin ends up in a human trafficking ring as a sex worker of sorts. I give the author a lot of credit, she made it sound terrible and grim, captured a lot of the horrible things that come with that line of work accurately. However, it lacked a lot of realism, because a large part of that unregulated world is also extreme violence, abuse, disease/sickness, drugs and so on. I take what I can get though.
Something else she captured well is how horribly Jimin's dad took him being gay, beat him and threw him out of the house. Grim, but something that happens. A lot. 
(Not that I ever wish any of these things on BTS members, Jesus, if anything like that happened to Jimin, I'd fly over there and beat some bitch asses up myself, don't get me started..!)

The story seriously ripped my heart out and tore it to shreds. I was pathetically snivelling on the subway. :')

I'm rambling and totally losing track here but my point is. Throw me your best fanfics that you feel kinda fit my miserable attempt at a general description?
Bestow your hidden BTS gems upon me, o sweet Army~!
Sorry for the long wall of text. Here, have a Kookie. 

P.S. I am totally Yoonmin biased, no shame. I have realized subconsciously that I haven't actually read a single fanfic where Jimin wasn't one of the main pair/characters. Not a requirement though, I take what I can get. But srs I like chimchim in these stories. A lot. c: 


_EDIT_: WAAAAH guys you're all amazing and I expected no less. Ya'll making me cry, uh I mean pff no I d-don't cry... Please come back and add more recommendations of your favorites, I'd love to read them and others would too! I know I said only angst and rambled a bunch, but honestly I'm up for anything that's good, be it unforgivable jawdropping smut or tearfest heartbreak city. ""Fanfics. Fluff. Smut. Give-give it to meh."" -Agust D (that's totally how the lyrics go. Shhhhh) &lt;3

_EDIT 2_: I started reading Tell It To The Stars, I'm already squealing from the first few paragraphs. Thank you guys. I would also like to take this moment and strongly recommend a fanfic I recently completed, which I would go as far as to say is the best I have read so far, (though I have yet to read HoC and TITTS). That fic, slightly on the longer side, is called Calamity and it's mostly OT7. Fair warning, very serious themes, but a very beautiful and well written piece. Prepare to cry here and there. And I guess if smut isn't for you, I wouldn't read it but this is definitely extremely good plot with decent humor and smut. Very well balanced, in my opinion. I am not one to read anything twice, but I would read this again in a heartbeat. ",145,40,False,self,,,,,

I've always hung around this subreddit because of the lovely people here; ARMY seems to be one of the kinder fandoms I've been in! I didn't' make an account until now, since I didn't see the need to. To be honest, I didn't get super into BTS until probably around mid December, and I regret that so much. By the time the pre-orders for the HYYH DVD came around, I was in love with BTS, but I was in a financially tough spot where I couldn't spare the cash for the set. Now, of course, I've managed to get a new job and I can actually afford some luxuries. But as we all know, the HYYH DVD is out of print, and I will be forever bitter. So I have a request for the people in this subreddit. I'm so sorry if this is impolite, rude, brash, impertinent, or anything of the sort. I just am so desperate for this set .

If you managed to obtain the HYYH DVDs, would you be willing to burn the three for a fellow ARMY? I'm not sure what my price range is, but it can certainly be discussed! Again, I'm sorry if this was ill-mannered or something. Thank you for your time!

I tried to summarize what was said since translators missed different parts or only translated half of what was said. 

I dont believe in in myself but someone here might find it interesting so I summarized the comments about it.

In general they said that Bangtans popularity will rise even more during 2017 and that theyll do more activities as a group. 2 members will rise and be really popular in 2017 (But later on in the individual reading they mention 3, but some think they only mentioned 2 members because of Taehyung - read individual part).

Taehyung: Will get a BIG job (some are saying new job which might insist in him leaving the group because of how it was worded) in 2017 and become even more popular because of it. He has to be careful while doing his job because he can have a stubborn personality. 
Taehyung is a genius with a lot of talent in his arts. And then they ended with saying that he actually also does have a little bit of a perverted side too. 

Jin: 2017 will be his year, his popularity will rise a lot, hell be in the center and ahead of the other members and that they will surround and support him. Some are translating it as him becoming the most popular member. Continued with saying that Jin is a careless person who will fall often so he needs to be careful while doing his job. 

Jungkook: Hell let go of his worries and troubles that has been worrying him for 6,5 years and become more relaxed during 2017. Hell have more fun and become better. His popularity will also rise among women. 

Jimin: His character will change significantly. (Better or for worse?)

Hoseok: Hes like a friend to army. But he needs to be a better listener. Everything else will stay normal.

Yoongi: Needs to communicate more with the army to become closer to them.

Namjoon: Has the closest relationship with army. His popularity will rise in 2017. 

What do you guys think? Will Jin become the most popular BTS member? Will BTS become a 6 member group without Taehyung? Will Jimin's personality change? Will Hoseok stay normal? Does Yoongi need to communicate more? 
Or is it all bull with some self explanatory comments?
