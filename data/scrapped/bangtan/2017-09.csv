This station is also part of Entercom, the same network that the Wisconsin radio station is a part of!  Since it probably has the same protocol regarding people listening outside of the US I'll try to record it for people who can't listen.

**I'm curious on how other ARMYs describe their dedication. Are you more of a casual fan or a hardcore fan?**

In my case, I've mellowed out a bit; I was completely obsessed when I first got into BTS (hours of bangtan bombs, tuning into vlives @ 2am, following any and all updates about them). But believe me, if BTS announces a tour near me, I'd be willing to drop dollars for the highest tier. Otherwise I don't spend as much time as I used to in following their whereabouts. I mostly follow them for their music and performances now. I'll occasionally watch an interview from time to time. If I'm in the mood, I'll watch the new Bangtan Bomb, but I haven't tuned in to their VLives lately and I don't keep up with their VLive shows. TBH I don't feel like I'm missing anything. I admit that sometimes I get lost in the hole that is Twitter and I'm sorry for admitting this up front but i don't spend my time streaming or voting (I get excited though when it comes to BTS on the radio. I'll tweet radio stations if I'm ever in the mood lol). But BTS got to my weak spot with this Amazon deal so I finally cracked and pre-ordered their new album (which I usually never do! Money is tight man I can't be buying all these albums)",46,40,False,self,,,,,

During today's Seo Taiji concert, people started posting on social media about how Jin didn't have enough time in the spotlight. I'm sure many of you are familiar with this, its become so common that I've begun to privately refer to it as the Biweekly Jin Pity Party. It's not so much the concept that bothers me, but the way people talk about him, which is borderline offensive. I often see people talk about Jin as if he's an animal or a child being taken advantage of, as if he's some wilting flower who deserves our pity and needs to be defended. It's especially hard for me to swallow given this discourse often takes over from the praise he might have received for what he did do. He was AMAZING today, his duet with Seo Taiji was my favorite part of the concert, and yet on all my social media accounts all I see are people talking about is how he didn't get to dance in front again. I think people forget  how Jin fought to have his version of Awake and won, and that he's a grown man and clearly no pushover. I don't trust Bighit further than I can throw them, but I do trust Jin's ability to take care of himself, and I don't understand why so many people aren't able to do the same. 

edit: The title is supposed to ""The way the fandom treatS Jin"" That's embarrassing 

edit 2: I've removed the parts about Jin being underappreciated, since it falls under comparing the members popularity. Since I'm seeing arguments popping up in the comments, I just want to clarify, this is not about how popular Jin is or isn't, or how many lines he has. Please don't turn it into that.

At the Seo Taiji concert, we all discovered that a whopping four out of seven members had blond hair. That's crazy, new fans will never be able to differenciate them. So that good and all, but as I was looking for fancams and pictures of the concert, I stumbled upon many discussions about possible hair colour changes before the comeback and other hair-related discussions. Can someone tell me *why* they would change their hair colour ? And how ? Are they just going to dye over the blond ? Then why did they get it dyed in the first place, won't it look terrible ? What does ""washing out yellow"" means ?  What's a ""transitional colour"" ? Why do some people think they had wigs on ? I don't get it.

I don't know anything about hair dyeing. Please help.",52,44,False,self,,,,,

Sorry for the odd question but this occurred to me when watching Suga's video, ""Agust D."" Why is he allowed to freely cuss and throw up middle fingers (not tryna hate, mans is hot as hell) in this solo release under BigHit, with the same company, ""JYP,"" yet his behaviour as an idol in BTS is so *controlled*? For example, when any of the boys accidentally swear in interviews, streams, etc., they immediately cover their mouths, laugh in embarrassment, or apologize, however, the lyrics in his song are pretty lewd, just wondering why that is allowed yet the same behaviour in BTS is reprimanded. Logically his behaviour and lyrics in his solo releases still have an effect on his idol image, right?

It seems our brethren in Korea also get it since they always talk about how BTS posts get downvoted in Pann.

There seems to be a strange prejudice going in the K-Pop community about BTS (they're overrated, they're ""fake deep"", they can't even sing) and Armys (they spam about BTS all the time, they need to educate themselves about K-Pop history, they think only BTS is the best). I am sure a lot of acts get hate, especially popular ones, but the level BTS and Armys get is on another level in the years that I have been in K-Pop. 

For example, during voting, antis would even vote against the BTS competitors to make us lose. Posts get downvoted even if it isn't offensive and simply share information (heck, I've seen news reports get downvoted in forums). Whenver Armys try to hype something about BTS, they get replies like ""BTS wasn't the only ones who have done that"". It can get frustrating sometimes, especially when they underplay a lot of BTS achievements and are hostile against Armys for no reason out of negative preconceptions. A lot of fans I know blame this on popularity of BTS, but I see other popular acts who do get hate (I was part of other fandoms too), but with BTS and Armys it's on another level honestly. Sure the comments spamming of some Armys are terrible, but it's harmless and simply annoying. But the hostility many K-Pop fans do in response can be a bit disheartening.

As an Army yourself, how do you deal with this? also why do you think there's so much hate?",65,39,False,self,,,,,

Clearly the boys and BigHit have struck gold with their marketing, promotion, and music. And yet, I've been reading up on the past generations of kpop groups and several groups that have reached comparable (for their times) or experienced steep rises in popularity have not been able to maintain their steam or have established solid individual careers. (For example, SS501, NRG, more recently Sistar). 

Obviously as the years pass and the boys get older and trends pass on to the new generation, BTS will no longer be ""the"" kpop group. How can the boys establish careers for the members and the groups to stay relevant? 

For example, in my opinion, within the next few years, it's important for the boys to launch individual careers (although it may be to varying levels of success as the Korean public is notoriously picky and hard to please).",21,36,False,self,,,,,

It seems that the albums are growing with their fans. I know that a lot of the users here are noona fans but I wanted to get a sense of where everyone is in their growth period.

For me, I think this era best fits my growth (as far as I know). Im still learning to love myself, what it truly means, how to start to open up and be vulnerable with others and how to start loving others. Like, it seriously sucks closing myself off sounds a lot more appealing than having to be vulnerable with another person even if it means being alone. I feel like Im stuck and the highlight reels and the theories that have been born out of this era so far have been things I have been emotionally connecting with. Which is pretty surprising since I connect a lot more with written works than any other form of media. Books can get me crying my eyes out while music, well theres only ever been one song Ive connected with and its not BTS. But as this era as progressed I can feel the first tendrils connecting and empathizing with the themes. 

So, before I keep rambling, where are you in your growth? Do you feel like youre more in the earlier eras; for example, your life is all about school and the stupid system that you can see if wrong but theres not a lot you can do about it? Or maybe youre older and are in the same period of growth as I am where were still learning what it means to fully and truly love ourselves? Or maybe you have already learned and moved past this stage and are waiting for BTS to catch up to you.",41,70,False,self,,,,,

I haven't stepped out of California in all my life, so this should be interesting! Is it odd that one makes a big move simply based off of a group such as BTS? In my opinion, I don't think so, but I'd like to know what you guys think. Personally, I think it doesn't matter who initially planted the seeds of interest-- if the tree is strong enough to live independently from it's creator, then it's something that can be rationally pursued. So, have you been influenced heavily by Bangtan that you went outside your comfort zone (study Korean, visit South Korea, etc)? I should also mention, I'm going solely to learn the language and experience the culture firsthand-- though I'd be caught in a lie if I said I didn't have some sort of fantasy in catching a glimpse hehe.  
  
Thanks in advance to all who read and share! Take care all!  
  
Edit: My goodness... a big thank you to everyone who has shared. Your stories are beautiful, they really moved me. I'm overjoyed that Bangtan has played some role in your lives! It makes me proud to be part of such a loving community. You all truly seem to be sincere and wonderful people. I pray you always find yourselves in good spirits and health. Thank you again!

Sometimes you'll love it right away and that never fades, or it takes a couple listens to warm up to it, and then there are the songs you instantly dislike and that never goes away... But then there can be songs that you loved in the beginning but now don't really do it for you anymore.

For me, when I first got into BTS **Danger** and **Let Me Know** were two of the songs that I replayed the most. But now I hardly ever choose to listen to them, and more often than not if they come up on shuffle I hit next.

For **Danger**, I initially really loved the aggressive nature of the song and the rock influences. But now I think the reason I don't care for it as much anymore is that the pre-chorus/chorus section feels like it goes on for way too long. I don't know, but it just kinda messes up the flow of the song for me. I still enjoy it when I'm watching the dance practice or live performances, but just purely as a song I don't really care for it as much.

But as for **Let Me Know**, I can't even pinpoint why I never really feel like listening to it. Perhaps I just got tired of it. But there are so many songs I've listened to way more but I haven't lost interest in... so who knows.

When it comes to the Billboard 200, I think there's a chance that we can place number 1 on the chart. With 'Love Yourself: Her' reportedly now available only through back order on Amazon, it means that ARMYs were able to buy all the stock Big Hit sent to the US for sale. Conservative estimates by some place the stock to be at 50,000 while others say probable estimate is 100,000. We're not sure how many were sent here, but it should be along those range. I would be really surprised if it exceeds 100k. Then you also have the Itunes sales and equivalent sales from streaming we could reasonably estimate an additional of somewhere between 25-35k for this comeback. (We had 16k with Wings good for #26 on the Billboard 200.) So this time around, based on those speculative numbers, it could go from somewhere between 70,000-135,000 album sales for BTS. A strong showing of more than 100,000 album sales could potentially get us #1 in the Billboard 200 which would be so huge. [So I linked the the other artists set to release albums on the 15th](http://www.metacritic.com/browse/albums/release-date/coming-soon/date) which we would be competing with since we release on the 18th. 

Our biggest competition is probably 'Foo Fighters.' Their last album from 2014 sold 190,000 copies on its first week for #1 on the chart. However if their new album doesn't match this output and Her exceeds our expectations, we're potentially looking at #1 on Billboard 200 which would be so huge for us. This might be bigger than a Billboard Award tbh. I know a lot of us are focusing on the Hot100 and rightfully so, however it's also important to consider that we might make it to the top spot of Billboard's album chart.  ",39,50,False,self,,,,,

We know HER is unlike any other BTS comeback we've experienced, this is the comeback that will determine a lot of things career-wise for BTS. This is the first time they are coming back after the success that was Wings, their first daesang, the BBMAs and the rebrand. This is also the first Korean comeback which had 1 million preorders (which aren't sales yet, this adds to the pressure). 

The whole Korean entertainment scene is watching if they will be able to sustain and deliver after the recent successes. Meanwhile Hollywood is also watching if they will be the first homegrown Asian popstars who will be able to truly break through.  So many things and in the midst of these are a bunch of boys in their early 20s. 

As an ARMY, what are your expectations and hopes for this comeback?

For me...

**HOPES**

* The boys stay healthy, I feel they'll be having crazy schedules until next year. 
* No more controversies. 
* The fans come through and the numbers will meet their expectations. 
* Another international award, hopefully. I actually want it more than another Korean daesang. 
* Perform at the MTV EMAs.
* A James Corden &amp; Ellen guesting.
* BB200 Top 10
* Hot 100 Top 40 please
* Massive radioplay
* BBMA nomination for music, even if they don't win :3


**EXPECTATIONS**

* Big Hit and BTS have a lot more surprises in store for us. 
* Musical growth.
* Each member being able to find their own sound. Jimin seems to be finding his. I think Jungkook has the voice which will be amazing if he manages to land a US collab. I think Jin sounds glorious in acoustic songs. Taehyung should try exploring rock and jazz. 
* More stops for the world tour. 
* Tokyo Dome

As some of you may know, this subreddit community has had a connected Discord server as of MAMA 2016. If you're not familiar with Discord, it's a live-chat platform with text and voice chat capabilities. [Here's a short Discord 101 video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ08Fbs5LpM)

The /r/bangtan Discord has grown into quite a close and familiar community over the past nine and a half months, and everyone is beyond excited for the comeback. If you aren't a part of it already and want to chat with fellow reddit ARMY, you should come by and check it out!

We'll be streaming any prior VLive content, the music video, and the album together. We've also been discussing the comeback in text and voice channels and we'll probably be freaking out in real-time when everything drops. Come on by if you want to celebrate the comeback with us!

Please check the [subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index) to learn how to get an invite. Hope to see you all there!

As you can infer from the title, we are ready to begin Jimin's birthday project :) The RM and JK projects have arrived in Korea and will be forwarded shortly to BH; once again we're sorry about the delay for this project. 

As always, we are looking for volunteers to help with our projects! If you would like to help, whether it be proofreading or receiving and sorting entries, please send us a PM. If you live in Korea and are able to help us forward the projects to BigHit, please PM us; we will reimburse you for any associated costs. Furthermore, if you would be willing to help translate the project (even for a short introductory message), any amount of help would be greatly appreciated!

Now onto the main purpose of this post! For our skim readers, we have bolded the main points and included a TL;DR at the bottom :)

&amp;nbsp;

As with all other projects, we will continue with the normal fan letters and fan art that has been done for each birthday so far.

For Jimin's birthday, we have decided on a theme of memories. As Jimin is the de-facto archivist of BTS and shares a lot of BTS with us, we thought about sharing our favourite memories of Jimin, BTS and in general. We **highly encourage** photographic and fan art entries! However, this theme serves mostly as an inspiration, and we will accept all letters and messages and other submissions etc., so long as they fit the simple guidelines below. 

##MESSAGES 

&gt;
&gt; * Please limit your message to **&lt;1250 characters** (about **250 words**).
&gt;
&gt; * No inappropriate messages. **Your message CANNOT contain anything inappropriate or any sexual content - we will remove your submission without warning if it violates this rule**. (Examples of inappropriate content include but are not limited to the following: any references to: sex, BTS/nonBTS pairings/couples, self-harm, criticism directed to JM's parents/family/friends, 'stalkery' tendencies, including your personal information such as phone/email/address/etc.)
&gt;
&gt; * Please include **ONE message per submission** using [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQSJdOcr7FR3PQo1brxGHsncVNX1XYQBaXDYinmubU4CwsPA/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you would like to send more than one message, please use the submission form again for each new message.
&gt;
&gt; * Please also **proofread your messages before submission** to maximize our time compiling the entries. We may also edit entries for spelling and grammar (no other edits will be made). If you leave your contact details below, we will contact you regarding any changes made.
&gt;
&gt; * You can send a handwritten letter as long as it's legible and follows the rest of the photo submission guidelines below. Please include **[MSSG] JIMIN submission** in your emails subject line when sending in handwritten letters. 
&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

##FAN ART / PHOTO SUBMISSIONS 

&gt;
&gt; * Please include **self created artworks and photographs only**.
&gt;
&gt; * We are **accepting all types of media** (hand-drawn, digital media, photographs etc.). If hand drawn or a non-digital piece, please **scan or photograph your work clearly** to a resolution of **at least 300 dpi**. If digital, we ask that your piece be **at least 300 dpi** (if you are unsure of the size of your image, make sure one side is at least 1000 pixels). 
&gt;
&gt; * **JPG, PDF, or PNG** files are acceptable.
&gt;
&gt; * 8 x 10 in (~20 x 25 cm) is the envisaged size of the pages, but you may submit any artwork or photograph up to the size of this space.

##DEADLINE + OTHER INFO 

The deadline for this project is **September 30 at 11:59 pm US CENTRAL time**. You can use this [time zone converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) to see what that translates to into your time zone. Remember to be timely with your submissions, as this project has a relatively short compilation time. 

* Comment *RemindMe! 10 days* under this post, to be reminded roughly a week before deadline. (You can also do this for any number of days before the deadline, e.g. RemindMe! 5 days or RemindMe! 12 days). 

* [View our localendar](https://www.localendar.com/public/r_bangtan) for deadline info; you can subscribe to events to be contacted about deadlines. 

* [Follow us](https://mobile.twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) on Twitter! And, make sure to enable notifications for us, so you can receive updates.

&amp;nbsp;

We will be sending out confirmation emails/PM's to double-check your submission is correct and/or to see if any changes need to be made. If you would like to be contacted about your submission, **please leave a contact** where we can reach you for these purposes, otherwise we will not contact you. This information will be kept confidential and will not affect how you chose to be credited. We will try to send a **confirmation message within a week of submission** but, depending on the volume of submissions, please understand it might take us longer. **If it has been some time, and you have not heard from us by the first week of October, please reach out to us to double-check**. We understand some of you are busy and that unexpected things happen, but we ask you guys to **please try to send your submission(s) as soon as possible**. Usually, the bulk of submissions have been submitted within the last 3 days or so prior to the deadline; and, while it's not impossible to go through 40+ entries, it does set us back a bit with sending the book to print and ship. So please send your submissions with ample time before the deadline, that way we can revise and place your entry accordingly. If you know in advance or think you might be a **late submitter, let us know when we can expect your entry**; then, that way we can send you a reminder and we know to wait for your submission.

&amp;nbsp;

We'd like to note that donating is not mandatory for participating in our projects, and if necessary, the coordinating team will cover all costs so that the project can be sent. Paired with each of our projects is a donation to charity as the gift (please see details below), and we'd like to make a large a donation as possible to charity.  If you'd like to make a donation, you can do so [**here**](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). We have made [a guide here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-hQrLJ_SjRPwO8jxx) but in summary, please leave a note specifying the project you'd like to donate to, your contact details and credit in the following format: 
 
**PROJECT(s) (write any comments here, including if you would like to split your donation) / CONTACT (email or Reddit username) / cr: CREDIT (name(s) and username(s) you would like your donation to be credited towards)**

For example, if I wanted to donate to the JM project, I would write *JM project / u/BTSprojects / cr: BTS projects* in the comment box. 

&amp;nbsp;

As with all our projects, this project will be paired with a donation to charity. We'd like to open up to the subreddit what cause you guys would like to donate to. Either a Korean or international organization is fine, so long as they have an option for PayPal donation. 

&amp;nbsp;

That was long! Thanks for reading till the end, so let's do a quick recap :)

Since we're all definitely having some trouble keeping track of when and what and what the hell is going on at any given time in our respective timezones, I made a couple of printable schedules for **EST** and **PST** (edit: &amp; **CDT** &amp; **CEST**).

If people are interested, I can make some for other time zones as well. (It's just an Adobe Illustrator file if anyone wants access to it too.)

I hope you all are surviving the final hours before this comeback. Currently, I am taking a class in college where I have to do a semester long research project on either a group or a topic. Being the person I am, I thought why not do this project on the bangtan subreddit? My professor (bless her soul) thought it would make an interesting project, so I decided to go ahead and ask permission of the mods first, which they kindly granted me. So now I have decided to ask if you all would be okay with me taking notes on everyday interactions and discussions on this subreddit? This project ultimately will produce a 20-25 page paper that only my professor and my class will read the results from. That being said, I can assure you that I will maintain your confidentiality and I will not reveal personal details that someone does not want to be shared. If you dont want me to include you then please tell me through PM or on this post so that I can exclude you from my notes. Basically, I just need to get your permission to do this. Later on in the project, I will need to interview people as well, which I would obviously ask for permission first when that time comes.

I hope you all are as hyped as the mod team is for this  comeback of the year! Because of this, we have been working hard and making plans to ensure that the sub is prepared and able to stay at least semi-organized for the onslaught of content we will be sure to get. We wanted to make an announcement about our plans (and theyre pretty extensive this time) so that you all wont be taken by surprise when it happens!  

The first thing is that were gonna have a *shit ton* of megathreads. Please dont post content outside of these megathreads that belong in them so that we can keep the sub organized and wont have to remove a bunch of your posts :( Some of the megathreads we are planning to have are: 

#Love Yourself: HER Comeback Hype/Spazz Thread  

Feel free to dump all of your emotions in this thread, whether its hype leading up to the comeback or excitement about after the release! I have scheduled AutoMod to post this about 3 hours before the release date, hopefully he isnt late...  

#HER Achievements Megathread  

See past examples: [WINGS Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/), [YNWA Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/)  

#HER Theories Megathread  

See past examples: [YNWA Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tmifx/ynwa_theories_megathread/), [Love Yourself Teaser/Films Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6tut7y/love_yourself_teasersfilms_theory_megathread/). I have scheduled AutoMod to post this about an hour before the release, hopefully he isnt late...  

#HER/DNA Radio Play Megathread  

This thread is where any posts about BTS/DNA playing on the radio should go (were feeling optimistic enough to make this thread in advance ;) )  

#HER English Press Coverage Megathread  

Heres where you should post all the English press coverage this comeback is sure to get, from Fuse to Billboard to Rolling Stone to NYT articles~  

**Important Note:** If its from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or dont have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets will be redirected to the megathread.    

#SNS Mentions Megathread  

Heres where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Insta, etc. when this album drops!  

**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone, like, Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread.  

**Important Note 2:** BTS tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be compiled into one self-post compilation [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/)  

#HER - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread  

This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream HER (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. Well try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys help to tell us since we dont know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  

This thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. Please keep any spazz type comments in the spazz thread instead of this one, since its for more thoughtful discussion.   

#Music Show Voting Megathread  

See past examples: [YNWA Music Show Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5thmw4/how_to_help_bts_win_on_music_shows_billboard_100/), See also the current [megaguide!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/)    

#Compilation Redirect Gigathread  

This thread will be **stickied** and contain links to alllll the other megathreads for your browsing convenience~  

*****  

Some of these threads are going to be manually posted by the mods, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. Some of us will be responsible for multiple threads, so cut us some slack!  

Honestly this comeback is gonna be crazy no matter what we do to try to combat it, but we just want to ask for your cooperation to make our lives a small amount easier, even with BTS killing all of us. 

Best of luck with [the hype train](https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png),

the ARMYS were hyped, there was quite a hubbub!  
Our fandom was ready to let out a cheer,  
for soon enough Love Yourself: Her would be here  
Subscribers were posting to multiple threads,  
while visions of BTS danced in their heads  
From veteran fans there were tips to be shared,  
so even a newbie could feel well prepared.  
And as I lay wide awake, scrolling the feed,  
I hoped and had faith that Bangtan would succeed  
In breaking new records and topping the charts,  
by being authentic and capturing hearts.  

  

I thought about how this comeback had unfurled,   
when BigHit revealed ""Love Yourself"" to the world  
The tweets and the articles written worldwide,  
were setting us up for one hell of a ride  
The Highlight Reel dropped, we were off at full speed,  
our own Worldwide Handsome Seokjin was the lead  
Then out came Jimin, with a solo at that,  
informing us all he's our calico cat  
We saw album photos, were charmed by their looks  
The Seo Taiji concert was one for the books  
Jungkook deftly whistled a tune in our ear,  
That's sure to turn out to be Bop of the Year  
The teasers were streamed and the concept reviewed,  
(for wearing that suit, Min Yoongi should be sued!)  
And then there's a show that stands out from the others  
Korean variety hit: Knowing Brothers  
The promo had sexy satoori from V,  
and J-Hope with dancing to make us all squee!  
Then one thing was clear, and we realized soon,   
that this is the era of Rapmon (Namswoon!)  

  

The hour draws closer, the atmosphere pops,  
not long til the MV for DNA drops  
We'll watch all the stages, the bombs and VLive,  
with all the exposure we'll barely survive  
The haters will hate and the antis will rant,  
they'll say that we won't and they'll say that we can't  
But all the K-diamonds and I-lovelies too,  
are ready to go and we know what to do  
We'll stream and we'll purchase, we'll tweet and we'll vote,  
and when we succeed, be too classy to gloat  
Our boys will perform and they'll make headline news,  
their MVs will quickly have millions of views  
And no matter what happens here in September,  
there's only one thing that we have to remember  
Through good and through bad and through all of the fuss,  
ARMYs love Bangtan, and Bangtan loves us.

#Vote for BTS on Music Shows!  

Hello! I know how much of a pain it is figuring out how music show voting works, so I decided to compile a guide here to detail how to support BTS in getting more music show wins (and so I can see my [OTP](http://68.media.tumblr.com/24aba1f5bc1f06bde8c11b44e74a6b47/tumblr_ohkue26RBk1qhmfcoo3_250.gif) of [Suga](http://66.media.tumblr.com/112f0ff274da307f6b4bc7c9486be4c1/tumblr_o0n6mrQ2Yl1s8hxm5o3_250.gif) [x](http://gifgifs.com/res/0516/57364c0ad0941666240177.gif) [trophy](http://33.media.tumblr.com/7a6ff1961076d15ef1c6e23b1ba7de93/tumblr_nnzap9U9JT1tkj9elo4_250.gif) once again. Annoyingly, each music show has it's own rules and ways of determining the winner so I'll detail it all here for this round of promotions. (If I've left anything out please let me know~!)

The comeback is in a few short hours and we couldn't anticipate more! In the meantime, the books for both projects have arrived in Korea! Please see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70na4q/a_quick_video_of_rbangtans_finished_2017_birthday/) for a short video, and much thanks to u/Rubyrues for sending them onto BH. We have written the update for RM's project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70qxuq/closing_post_rm_birthday_project_2017/). Currently, we are also running[ Jimin's birthday project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70m5eg/jimins_birthday_project/), so please check that out if you haven't already. 


For [Jungkook's project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project), since in the past Kookie has mentioned he likes photography, we had a photography ""map"" theme for this project. We grouped photographs (and their respective entries - fan art or letters) depending on where the image was taken (and fan art and letters by the location of the sender). We received 154 entries from 50 participants from over 20 countries! 

While we would love to share the whole final product with you, for privacy reasons, we will show only the [template](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-hzBbHyto2TFdjuLp) we used for the book to give you an idea of what the book looked like. Many of the messages and photographs were deeply personal and beautiful, so we will keep them private. If you'd like to see how your entry looked as a final edit, PM us with an email address where we can send you the pictures and we will endeavour to respond as quickly as possible (may take up to a week).

Paired with this project is a **charity donation to BAPS** (Busan Abandoned Pet Sanctuary) as our gift to JK, as he has [mentioned](http://www.vlive.tv/video/17071) wanting to help abandoned dogs in the past. [BAPS](http://shindogs.org/) is known for being a no-kill based animal sanctuary in Busan that focuses on re-homing abandoned dogs. Unfortunately, BAPS in its current form (the shelter) has had to [close down](https://www.facebook.com/shindogs/posts/10155097865954685), as they faced chronic issues with funding and were no longer able to rent their location. However, they still run dog rescue and activism activities and continue to run the program [Wendy's Last Meals](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WendysLastMeals/permalink/546016675591793/). 

They still had many ongoing costs at the time of our donation, and we're pleased that we were able to come together to help them in some small way. We were able to raise $75.72 for BAPS, exceeding our initial goal. If you are able to donate, please consider doing so, as they have done so much excellent work for the dogs in their care and for activism regarding abandoned dogs on a shoestring budget, and still have much work to do. 

With the JK and RM projects, we have now raised over $1000 for various charities so far. Thank you so much for your generosity, and for contributing to these donations in the boys' names. 

Since we wish to be 100% transparent, we apologize once again for the delay of the printing and shipping due to various real life circumstances, including ex-Hurricane Harvey impacting one of our coordinators. We will try to be as timely as possible in the future. 

Thank you once again for supporting our projects, and we look forward to working with you on further projects.

In Africa, Asia and Latin America, they partner with communities to help empower them through a holistic, sustainable international development model to help break the cycle of poverty, especially so that all children and youths have access to education and don't have to work to ensure their family's survival. They also have educational programs in the UK, US and Canada to inform students and give them the tools to create transformative social change. We were able to raise $120.12 for this project, exceeding our goal of $50.

I'm mostly a lurker here but occasionally comment. I'm a few weeks into my second year at uni, and I found out someone is writing an album review of 'Her' for our school newspaper (I only wrote for them for a year but am still on the mailing list). Just wanted to share this because it made me so happy for some reason; the author seems really excited about the album and in general what it will mean for BTS' popularity in the US. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with posting the article link publicly (when it becomes available) here, but if anyone is curious, please DM me! 

Again, this is just a random story haha. It just made me really happy. I know I'm posting here now but since school started I really haven't much time to spend time on things I really enjoyI haven't even watched DNA or listened to any of the album yet ;-; Hope everyone is enjoying the comeback though!

P.S: guys, I totally forgot Her was going to be released lol, soooo what do you guys think we should do with DNA's choreo (and the b-sides choreos as well)? In my opinion I think we should leave them all out of the survivor for now, and then after a few more comebacks we can redo the choreo survivor (as well as the ultimate survivor and MV survivors). Maybe we can make the ultimate/MV/choreo survivors a yearly thing to see how the sub's opinion changes as new music gets released. What do you guys think? ^\(btw ^(sorry if i'm not being clear enough because I'm suuuper tired and really need to go to sleep lol i can try to explain myself better next time if this seems confusing)^\)",19,31,False,self,,,,,

So... I didn't expect to not love the new album, but I guess I don't. I've listened to Love Yourself :  Her quite a bunch of times now, both all the way through and track by track, and it is not growing on me at all. Quite the reverse. It's not that it's that **bad**  per say, but it feels utterly forgettable to me. 

I can't help but feel so bummed out. This was my first comeback, from the first group I've ever been a fan of. I am a very casual music listener in general, so being part of the community here for months was an incredible experience. I was hyped to the high heavens for the comeback, despite the sometimes off-putting promotions. I wasn't worried at all about where their sound was going, because I really enjoy both their older style and their newer songs. I've loved Come Back Home instantly and played it all summer, and I've had Serendipity in my mind since it came out. I was ready to love anything Bangtan had in store. 

I guess I am a young and naive over-invested idiot  for writing this but I somehow didn't think it possible for them to release an album's worth of music I didn't really enjoy, and even worse, music I didn't care about. I feel like a little lost lamb with a BTS shaped hole in my heart. What the hell am I going to do with the time I allocated myself to listen the album and stan the boys? 


So anyway, the album is here to stay whether I think it's any good or not. And, of course, I still like BTS a lot, but I don't think I can keep on fangirling about them in spite of the album, especially when they'll be so preoccupied with post-comeback promotions. I just feel like I am in for six months worth of drought, when I am already in a super competitive environment this year and BTS was supposed to be my way to cool off. 

So here is my question to those who have already lived through this cataclysm : did you simply put your love for BTS on hold? Did you still check out the new stuff despite not enjoying it fully? Did you hibernate till next comeback? Did you drop the group until something made you stan them again? 


(Of course, I'll still check out the promotions and at least one concert fancam to see if I like the performances more. But I doubt it, I generally don't like performances that much if I don't already like the song.)

Edit : eh people, I am not that serious,  and no need to downvote so much. I guess I can't properly convey humor in English. I'm just listening to Her and being pretty bored.",116,69,False,self,,,,,

I really need to get this out and I have nobody else to talk to about it.  
  
So I've had enough time to fully mediate on the album and sound-wise, I loved everything. I do think it's very different, but that's Bangtan for you. Nothing makes me happier than putting all of their songs on shuffle and never being bored. These gems will surly add even more flavor to that lovely musical feast I listen to everyday. Something has been dogging my mind after reading the lyrics and even some of the fan-cafe posts the guys made (post album release). Only after reading the lyrics to Sea and the skit transcript did this feeling come into perspective- it was melancholy. The best mental image I can think of is a cold, fall day, right after the rain stops. It's quiet, overcast but very tranquil. It's that time where you just stare at nothing in particular and feel empty yet completely full. Stark contrast to what DNA gave us, haha. They've been honest with us, opening up about their own fears and feelings through lyrics and logs, but with Her... I felt something different. Specifically with Sea, Outro: Her, Pied Piper and the skit. It's hard to put into words, but there is something very raw about those four. The skit especially, if you haven't read/listened to it, [please do so](https://twitter.com/rosoidae/status/910299558999072769)- it's extremely deep. Part of this melancholy is actually sheer admiration that they would even share feelings like this with us. What artist and/or idol would? Who trusts their fans this much? Obviously they do, and I know every person in the social spotlight that has a following praises their fans to the extreme to keep them rowing their boat. With Bangtan though, it's different and I say that with no cliches attached. They show us this beautiful humanity and offer us a friendship that should otherwise be impossible-- many of us have never even seen or spoken to them, yet, there exists this mutual love and care. I seriously think if you're into psychology there's something interesting to look at here, something like this shouldn't be possible. I digress though (see word vomit), back to Her. I didn't get so much the sense that they're sad about something... more that they're fearful of something. It was explored in the skit that they're afraid to fall and that the fall is inevitable... but it pains me that they're in this state of mind when there's no reason for them to be thinking about the edge. Namjoon said that we're constantly in the transition phase, once something is reached something else pops up and the cycle starts over. That's life, in a sense, there is no end unless you physically pass I suppose. Even goals attained are simply milestones to the next phase. I don't want to say they're pessimistic either, but there's something there, like a monster looming over their shoulders ready to devour them. I just... I feel for them. It kills me to think they're afraid of messing up, they'll lose everything or fully expose who they truly are and we not like it. I've seen enough to have a decent idea of the people under these 'masks' and I completely think their fears are irrational. We're not perfect, they're not perfect and thank god for it. I live for the moments where they mess up- expose the 20-something year old human in there. Perhaps even show an emotion other than sunshine and rainbows- I know others do too. I just... I want them to be happy. I want them to be comfortable with where they're at and not fear what we think. It's a game of balance but I think the scale is not as delicate as they think. They don't need to hold back. Perhaps Her was the first step in letting go? Opening up about this, blatantly calling it out, perhaps this is the path to change? The turning point as they've mentioned. I pray they've been happy during these times. I pray that everyday they continue to grow and transition onto a better phase both as a group and individually. They've done so much for us, they've worked so hard... it's the least they deserve.  
  
Okay. I'm sorry for that. Please tell me your thoughts. Did you feel something similar after having time to let things settle? 
I'll probably edit this mess of a post tomorrow or something. Please take care all.  

--------------  
Edit: First and foremost, thank you all for your replies. They were extremely insightful, I really appreciate everyone taking the time to share their thoughts.  
I must say though, after reading through them my melancholy turned more into blatant sadness (hah). Perhaps I was more blind and delusional than I thought? I didn't know these fronts they put up were as false as they are. The words 'personas' and 'characters' were the sharpest knives, especially when I think of them in terms of BV, logs and more toned-down lives. As some of you have mentioned, they reflect only a 'concept' to us. Perhaps it's denial, but I don't want to believe that. K-pop industry or not, unless my thinking is completely backwards, I don't think Bangtan or BH would *create* these 7 people simply to please us. I thought BH was different... as someone has speculated, I'm not really new to this community, but I don't stan any other group nor do I know anything that goes on with them. When it comes to K-pop outside of BTS, I'm clueless. Obviously, I knew that many times the guys have repressed any negative emotion for the sake of a show or acted over the top because the camera was on, but I didn't think it was as prevalent outside of certain promotional media. I thought even when they acted like this, we were to some extent getting part of who they are- if that makes sense. Like for example, Namjoon is a leader but sometimes I feel like he'd prefer to let that inner-child out, the one who is fascinated by crabs and jumps around excitedly. He's still a leader though. Or Hobi's over-top personality. His though, unless it is fabricated, I think might just be something that happens when he's in front of a crowd/preforming. He tones down in more domestic settings even when being blatantly recorded. I know people change dramatically when they're being filmed. It might be a mix of both, but regardless I think that loud, funny guy is still part of him just magnified on camera and voided of any negative thoughts. Anyways, I'm probably in a severe state of denial right now. I feel like everything I thought and knew went out the window. It's tough hearing this when you stan them as people. I don't want to look up to 'personas' or 'characters'. If that's the case, we'd all be idolizing fictitious characters to this magnitude. I really want to believe that perhaps I'm over-analyzing some replies, but it seems like a majority of you guys think this way. I don't know, I guess I just thought it wasn't leaked so heavily into certain things. Like, we got some sliver of who they are most times just to different degrees depending on what we're seeing-- some strong to truth, others intermediate and some very over the top for the sake of a show. This honestly has been eating away at me all day. I can't help but feel really, really down- like a kid who just found out Grandpa was Santa this whole time. I find myself questioning everything they've shown us about their personalities now, even the smallest things. Was it all just for show? Sorry again for word vomit... and sorry for seeming like that delusional fan. ",87,178,False,self,,,,,

I think most of LY:Her is ""public friendly"", especially Best of Me since one half of the Chainsmokers helped in its production (plus radio DJs could refer to this fact).

Hello! I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but I am an ARMY that has recently won a battle with health that could have resulted in death. I won't go into details, but after such a battle, I have really wanted to do something with my life. One of those things is a desire to learn to dance. However, there are two problems I face: For one, I have looked in various places and trusted sites, and there are no private dance teachers in my area... let alone ones who probably know who BTS even is. And, secondly, my condition makes it irritating for my body to move, so it's hard for me to dance to just *any* song. Yet, my boyfriend has noticed that when I try dancing to BTS songs (attempting to imitate their dance moves by watching mirrors), my love for the music somehow distracts from the discomfort and allows me to keep moving for a considerably more amount of time. So, I wanted to reach out to fellow ARMY and find out if there would be anyone willing to tutor me once or twice a week (depending on your price) in dancing BTS songs. I live in Westminster, California, in the United States, can only drive on inside roads, so can only drive within reasonable distance. I also have no dance experience, so please be patient with me and I swear that I will try my hardest.

I hope this isn't against the rules-- I read them, and there didn't seem like there were rules against this kind of topic. I suppose I am a bit desperate posting here, but what can I say? haha.. thank you for your time and I wish you all a pleasant day! If I didn't answer enough regarding the dance teacher stuff, feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer or clarify!",23,60,False,self,,,,,

This week has been an emotional rollercoaster for us ARMY, especially with the plethora of content being thrown our way. It's my first comeback, so to say that it's been overwhelming is an understatement! I thought it would be fun to discuss the ways we keep up with content (and other BTS-related hobbies) and perhaps it may serve as useful ideas for some of us!

**1. What is on your BTS to-do list? (What articles, shows, interviews, etc. have you added to your queue?)**

**2. Do you have a specific system or routine that you use to catch up with BTS content?**

**3. What is your preferred method of enjoying BTS content with other fans?**

**4. Any miscellaneous bit you'd like to add! :)**

1. I added the [Billboard](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7966098/bts-love-yourself-her-album-rap-monster-interview-analysis-meaning) and [ETOnline](http://www.etonline.com/exclusive-bts-celebrate-their-biggest-album-ever-and-reveal-what-they-love-about-themselves-87665) articles to my reading list. I plan on going to my favorite cafe this weekend to sit down and read through the written content I've missed. While I'm there, I also plan on reorganizing my notes app with all of the lyrics from Love Yourself: Her. Also, I have yet to watch their V-Live [Comeback Special](http://www.vlive.tv/video/41492?channelCode=FE619), which I am savoring for when I have more downtime. Like many of you, I am already anticipating the re-uploaded and subtitled Mnet Comeback Show, which will shoot up my priority list once it's available! Lastly, I've been saving Kim Namjoon's [Beats 1 interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/716wa5/170919_rapmon_beats_1_interview/?st=j7wozbo4&amp;sh=7fe8d622) for later this weekend as well.  

2. My weekday schedule is ridiculously busy, so my 2-hour roundtrip commute is when I squeeze in some BTS time. I tend to reserve the morning commute for strictly listening/following along with lyrics and the afternoon for listening and browsing through /r/bangtan (whenever subway service allows, haha)! If I have the energy and time when I get home, I'll watch their shorter video content, such as [DNA MV Reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx6ZYcZnoW4), but I usually just continue listening to music and hop on the /r/bangtan Discord server and browse through my favorite channels for a little bit. The weekend is usually reserved for catching up on longer videos and having the Discord server up for most of my waking hours. :)

3. I love, love, love reading through /r/bangtan. This subreddit and its mods are amazing! Also: [/r/bangtan Discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord) is my preferred place to interact with other fans. Go Go, click the link and join! But seriously, everyone is fun and welcoming. I've made some great friends on there and even attended a NYC noona meet-up recently because of it!

4. I want to wrap up my post by adding that I've dedicated Monday evenings to learning Korean! I go to class for an hour and a half and have been loving it so far! It sounds extremely cheesy, but I love going over my notes and practicing at home while listening to BTS, haha! To limit distractions, I tend to opt for a bit of [Smyang Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXRRaSlACUk). 

While it may seem like we let BTS take over our lives, I think finding a balance is key and there is nothing wrong with enjoying something that makes you happy! I can't wait to hear from you lovely people. :)

This is a game to determine which BTS dance/choreo we like best.

&gt;The seven-piece is expertly navigating the overseas momentum that's been building since their appearance -- and win -- at the Billboard Music Awards in May. But its been a long road for the former underdogs, and the main constant in the boy bands career has been their fan base, ARMY, who have watched the group go from handing out flyers for their shows on their reality show, American Hustle Life, to selling out the Olympic Park Gymnastics Arena in Seoul last year.

This makes me soft. So many good things have been happening this past week. I just want to say that I'm glad that I stumbled upon Save Me mid July last year and here I am now celebrating milestone after milestone with fellow ARMYs. It's nice that the writer has taken her time to write about how ARMYs have helped propelled BTS' success from their first win till now. My heart is full. ARMYs, let's continue making histories alongside Bangtan and get the boys even higher. ARMY fighting!",7,70,False,self,,,,,

For me, as someone who was a fan of groups that never really put out much content--and when they did, it felt kind of impersonal--I think what's kept me an ARMY is the amount of content that BTS puts out and how it always feels pretty natural and unforced. They really made me care for all seven members with their Bombs and tweets (especially their old replies to fans lol) and logs, and they feel like family members who I always want to catch up with. I can't imagine not caring for them, even if I don't always love their music or their choices, because they hold a special place in my life.",28,45,False,self,,,,,

Conan had his Korean special last year, made a music video with JYP and Steven Yeun that Wonder Girl's and Twice was also in, I've also seen him have fairly unknown (maybe at least to me) or new musical acts on his show so he doesn't always have A list American musical acts on his show.

With the success of their new album, ever growing popularity, the billboard award they won earlier this year, the insanity that is their social media presence, people also seem more open to the idea of hearing non-English music with the success of despacito and them being Korean/Asian I imagine would also improves their chances in today's diversity pushing climate.

It's no secret that BTS appears to have mastered the art of using global success as an entrance to domestic success. 

* Unlike other groups who first gained domestic success before gaining some measure of international success (sort of as a cherry on top), BTS actually first gained international adulation, which then transformed into domestic success when the accolades started pouring in. 

    * There's even a joke on OH that the reason Big Hit doesn't media play much compared to other companies is because the Korean media does it for them, and there seems to be evidence for this in the form of the numerous, numerous broadcasts about every achievement BTS gets from HYYH era to right now and the BBHot100.

* Furthermore, BTS's success in the West, on Billboard and the European charts also helped them gain a stronghold in Japan, where they were advertised as ""globally relevant"" idols, rather than just Korean idols. Just take a look at their promotions in Japan this year. They were always introduced as international artists who ""beat JB, Ariana, etc.""

Anyway, my question is, do you think this format that BTS used so successfully is replicable? 

* Will some small, no name company be able to follow Big Hit's strategy to success by getting humongously popular outside their home country and then importing that success home? 

* Or is this some serendipitous phenomenon, limited in time and space to this one special group of seven adorable, inspiring young men?",60,75,False,self,,,,,

Ive been kind of in awe since I first heard the track. (Its like getting sucked into a black hole, and then suddenly the black hole taps you on the shoulder and asks you how youre holding up.)

 It's especially interesting how BTS presents their own thoughts and feelings on the nature of the fan-idol relationship in Pied Piper. They use this very sensual, teasing voice throughout the song. At first it may seem like theyre just patting themselves on the back for ensnaring us. But then 

&gt; If Im perhaps ruining you right now / Could you forgive me?

theres this clear undercurrent of guilt in the song as well, right? Like BTS is expressing remorse, apologizing to us for making us spend all our time on something superficial (aka them).

In any case, here's what I'm wondering:

 What was your reaction when you first realized what Pied Piper was about? Was it a rude awakening, something that lingers in the back of your mind, or something you feel comfortable laughing at and brushing off? 

 Most importantly, has Pied Piper made you want to change the way you think or see or act as an ARMY? Or even more generally as a consumer of media and participant in fan culture?

It honors outstanding achievements and international contributions of Asian artists in television and music.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Artist_Awards) 


&amp;nbsp;

AAA is one of the easiest sites to vote on and it is also really important for future achievements. We are currently shaking between #1 and #2, the gap is always small tho. 
Eventhough there are three rounds, all Armys should start voting as it's still easy now (without downloading an app etc).


&amp;nbsp;

1. ##Go to website http://www.asiaartistawards.com/vote/lists

2. Change language to English (or Chinese, Japanese and Korean) if you need to and log in with FACEBOOK or NAVER Account

3. **Vote everyday for BTS**, you can also use multiple accounts-
If you suceeded in voting, there will be a pop-up with ""Thank you for voting"" or ""You have already voted"".

Round 1 is 'till 10th October. 


&amp;nbsp;

Edit: The website isn't working sometimes, just try it a few minutes later!

BTW: ARMYS WANT TO TREND #VoteBTSonAAA ON TWITTER. https://twitter.com/hashtag/VoteBTSonAAA?src=hash


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

#**Please take 60 seconds of your time to vote for BTS who worked months to deliver a great comeback. Let's help them win more awards. **


[Edit; I am starting to read on SNS that this voting is NOT for Daesang which is right, it's the Popularity award. Obviously, just a voting by fans won't decide the winner. Only the Award SHOW (AAA) consists of giving the award Daesang **but** votings like this are still taken into consideration along with Digital Streaming, etc. So it's still important! We want BTS to get a Grand Prize, right? So we have to do everything we can.]

Basically, the idea is that each song in Bangtan's discography has a personality, don't you think? Based on your idea of the personality of each song, who would you be friends with? Who would you have a crush on? Who would you steer clear from? Who would you wanna party with? Who's a bad influence?

I would almost certainly be besties with Blanket Kick. They seem super sweet, daydream all day like me, is generally clumsy but is so endearing! 

I would definitely be head over heels for MIC Drop- they're the person who does what they want at all times, is a rebel, is super confident (bordering on cocky), and it's all just obnoxiously attractive, lol. 

Of course this doesn't have to be limited to friends and crushes- feel free to mix it up and have fun with it! :)",35,36,False,self,,,,,

Does anyone else worry that the bigger they become in the US, the more the racists will come out of the woodwork and post comments on social media that BTS may read and become affected by? I'm not sure I'm saying this right, but I remember there were a lot of racist comments after their BBMA win and I hate to think of the members reading or hearing about comments like that and being hurt by them. I'm a new US fan and I love that they are becoming more well known here but I'm afraid it may have a downside as well because unfortunately racism is still a huge problem n this country.",30,29,False,self,,,,,

This is a game to determine which BTS dance/choreo we like best. All you have to do is **vote for the choreo you like the least.** Whichever choreo gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds. A new round ^(usually) gets posted every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

Last round *** (Dope)*** was eliminated with 38% of the votes, but * (FIRE)* was really close behind with only one vote less. And now, the final round begins - which choreo do you think is going to win?

A few months ago I asked for your [input on BTS related birthday gifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6ifyko/army_a_mothers_humble_request). I also mentioned having a cake made and some of you were interested in seeying it.

The day came around and [here is the cake](https://imgur.com/a/bJZbx)!
The cake is chocolate / raspberry with printed edible images. The hand-heart sticking out is acrylic so she can keep it.

The front has her name in hangul which is why I blurred it.

She also got not 1 but 2 albums, a V sweater and a pack of photocards.

One album is a great story. I held off on ordering online as shipment is quite steep to west Europe. However one day my husband was working a job for people who just got back from Korea.
He asked them why they went there and the woman replied because her daughter was the most fanatical army. Can't be he said, mine already is. In that case said the mom, I bought an album for a friend who already owned it, care to take it off my hands for retail price? Obviously he didn't have to think long!
I mean how poetic can it get?

I swear she cried all day just looking through the photo album.

Hope you guys are inspired and again thank you for taking the effort in answering my query!",19,198,False,self,,,,,

It's us again, and we will really keep this as short as possible. If you live in Korea or will be in Korea in the first few weeks of October, and are able to help us forward the project to BigHit, please PM us; we will reimburse you for any associated costs. 

Now onto the main point of the post:

&amp;nbsp;

**We have decided to extend our deadline for the Jimin project to 3 October 11:59 pm.**

&amp;nbsp;

This is in an effort to allow as many people to participate as possible. We haven't received many submissions, which has allowed us to extend the deadline. If you can do so, we highly encourage you to participate!

Please use [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQSJdOcr7FR3PQo1brxGHsncVNX1XYQBaXDYinmubU4CwsPA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit messages and fan letters, and please see the [**main post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70m5eg/jimins_birthday_project/) for how to submit fan art, photographic entries and other kinds of entries. 

The theme of this years project is that of memories. As Jimin is the de-facto archivist of BTS and shares a lot of BTS with us, we thought about sharing our favourite memories of Jimin, BTS and in general. Photographic and fan art entries are very welcome! Please note that theme serves mostly as a rough inspiration for the sake of having a theme, and you don't have to follow the theme for your submission; all submissions are welcome. 

We have included a little sneak peak of the book [here](https://imgur.com/a/XRcBO). We got inspired by Serendipity's lyrics and created a tiny blue mold cat. Were also working on an animation of the cat in a petri dish so we can make the booklet into a flip book. (We did something similar with [Yoongis project](https://youtu.be/8sg9ZKmxbBY?t=2m10s).)

Like with all our projects, we will be pairing a charity donation as our gift to Jimin. We will likely be donating to either a children's charity (perhaps something like Make-A-Wish, given the theme of memories), or an animal related charity, given that Jimin has previously done charity work related to children and loves animals. We'd really welcome your suggestions and comments, please leave a reply below!

As always, the coordinating team will try to cover all printing+shipping costs and it is not compulsory to donate to participate. However, we'd like to make a large as a donation gift as possible, and if you'd like to help us cover the costs you can do so [here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). We have made [a guide here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-hQrLJ_SjRPwO8jxx).

&amp;nbsp;

We hope many of you can join us for this project! If you guys have any questions, please feel free to PM us or ask below.

&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely,
