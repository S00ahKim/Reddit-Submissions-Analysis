Hello! I know how much of a pain it is figuring out how music show voting works, so I decided to compile a guide here to detail how to support BTS in getting more music show wins (and so I can see my OTP of [Suga x trophy](http://33.media.tumblr.com/7a6ff1961076d15ef1c6e23b1ba7de93/tumblr_nnzap9U9JT1tkj9elo4_250.gif) once again). Annoyingly, each music show has it's own rules and ways of determining the winner so I'll detail it all here for this round of promotions. (If I've left anything out please let me know~!)     

##Tuesday: The Show  

##**NOTE: The Show had its last broadcast of the year the 7th. And Bangtan won! But you don't have to vote any more ~ I'm just leaving it here for reference.**  

###Voting Breakdown by %  

* Album sales + Digital sales + SNS (Korea) (35%)  
* Tudou music video views + pay vote items (China) (35%)  
* Live voting (for *The Show* Choice nominees only): Total 30% (15% Korea text votes, 15% China Tudou votes)    

###What To Do:  

1. Stream on Tudou as much as you can! [Link here](http://music.tudou.com/theshow/index.html). Click on the orange button next to their name and stream the video! ([Pic](http://imgur.com/A0H1zuw)). Same rules as increasing the view count for the MV on youtube; using incognito works best.    
2. Twitter points. Go to twitter and post tweets that contain @SBS_MTV # #. All three of those have to be included for the tweet to count. You need to have words in between each of the tags and in front as well. For example: ""Hey @SBS_MTV Can't wait for # to win on # ! Go BTS!"" Also don't attach pictures/video to your tweet. Do this as often as you can!  

##Wednesday: Show Champion  

###Voting Breakdown by %  

* 45% Digital Sales (Melon)  
* 10% Physical Sales (Hanteo)

2. Stream ""Run"" on Melon! This is difficult outside of Korea, but [here's a tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BDUzz2p79XOkUxtHxduLZLq1etERLwwQGI96wDYuVeY/edit) if you're interested.

It doesn't mean someone who is shy, or who lacks confidence, or who is nervous in public or doesn't like public speaking, performing in public, etc. That's a common misconception.

An introvert is someone whose emotional and spiritual energy (for lack of a better term) is drained when they're around too many people. Crowds suck energy from them. Introverts want to be with a handful of really close friends. They're fine just hanging out with their friends and listening to their friends talk. 

They need time alone to recharge their emotional batteries and creative energies.

On the other hand, extroverts are energized by being in public and around other people. When they're out and about they get buzzed. They feed off the energy and want more of it. Extroverts can still be shy and nervous around new people. They can still be afraid of speaking in public or doing performances or whatever. It's just that their emotional and spiritual energy is recharged differently.

In this fan cam of BTS watching [Big Bang at MAMAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HXMr5D05c) it seems to me that we can pretty clearly see the difference. 

V and Jungkook are partying like it's 1999 and Suga's just sitting there soaking in the atmosphere. I'm extremely introverted (even though I love public speaking), and this is *exactly* how I behave at concerts or while listening to music, even music that has a great emotional impact on me. I'll bob my ahead along with it, but I don't  get into it.

OTOH, my wife is an extrovert and she would act just the way Jungkook and V do. 

I'm also thinking a bit of the skit on the album where everybody is talking but it seems like Suga is just soaking it in. Also in the BTS [Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26N-O9lmYRQ) version of *Run* Suga is the one that slid in the smallest space possible underneath the bench. That's totally something an introvert would do (my parents have pictures of me as a kid curled up underneath a kitchen table chair reading a book because I liked the cramped space).

A big deal, since Inkigayo is much harder to win than the music shows they've won already.  

I also want to let everyone know that prevoting for M!Countdown has opened (and it's the easiest to make an account for. If you have a twitter or facebook you can just use that)- we're up against *really* tough competition this week, like EXO, so every vote counts! We might be winning by a lot right now, but as soon as Exo fans realize that we'll probably be crushed. So it's best to get a really big head start! Also keep voting on Show Champion and The Show!

I tried searching for a similar discussion and couldn't find one- my apologies if this thread has already been made. If not, I think it'd be cool to discuss your favorite dances and why you like them! I really don't think it's overkill to praise every member of BTS for their dancing ability...it's definitely one of their greatest strengths as performers. 

So, here are my top 3 BTS choreos:

[**3. Danger**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJwHIpEogEY): J-Hope ***brings it*** in this dance, especially this practice vid. He's so sharp it hurts. I love Jungkook's entire section, the slight house-esque shuffle during the pre-chorus, but I think what ultimately makes this dance for me is that you can somehow manage to make 7 guys rubbing their necks into a dope dance move. That shouldn't even be possible, but it is, and it's fantastic. Also, shoutout to Suga's ""mwoni mwoni nan nega mwoni"" line, as that part in the choreo is dope af.

[**2. N.O.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VoSHt8zFNI): Aww, I love this song and choreo so much. Maybe it's because I recently read that interview with BTS's main choreographer, but I have a very soft spot for this dance. It's done really well, particularly the end with the ""officers""- the entire capture of each member was really cool. 

[**1. Boy In Luv**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqz6Adx63w8): I could watch this a thousand times and never get sick of it. I ***love*** this choreo. From J-Hope's verse (hakuna matata, oh!) to the pre-chorus level changes to Suga's verse where they form a car...so, so good. So good.

Okay, what are your favorites? Let me know!

I computed the scores of those who listed their top 5s and their honorable mentions and totaled it. Scoring is as follows: #1 is equivalent to 5 pts, #2 is 4 pts, #3 is 3 pts, #4 is 2 pts, #5 is 1 pt, while honorable mentions get half a point. Now, for those who listed multiple songs per number, say #2 is listed as run/i need u, then those two songs get half of the equivalent or they both get 2 pts of the total 4pts. For the honorable mentions every named song got their half a point, those who listed an entire album all of those songs got half a point, only those who listed 'all bts songs' were nullified cause fuck i ain't doing that. All in all 19 people participated. Thank you, guys!

These are my guesses.

	one comeback, Yoongi drops his mixtape, so does Namjoon, vocal line does a thing; they sweep literally everything and will be active throughout the year

	the comeback will be a full album, same theme as HYYH  youth and struggles, but the title track will not sound like INU/Run

	One of the tracks will sound more like Dope; this will be the song that hits it internationally again

	Taehyung doesnt growl in any of the songs, Jin gets more lines (the latter is tentative. rip)

	Jimin will reprise Yoongi as the second most known member

	One member, not Jimin, will express his hatred for their older eras (NMD/N.O)

	One member will get a solo magazine photoshoot and I feel like itll be Jin

	BTS Showtime will happen

	A tour will be a thing probably; the teaser will be kind of an epilogue to HYYH, but the full albums MV will not have HYYHs 
storyline continued. Europes in it this time.

	more Taehyung composed songs

	I will like Yoongis mixtape more than Namjoons and the group album will be amazing. Vocal lines stuff will be amazing as well.

	Yoongi will have black hair again, Jimin has black hair again for one era

	basically continue their momentum and are raised as one of the top groups

	The Namjoon hate will die down

	Manage the year without any scandal.

	Yoongi will not diss Bobby in his mixtape, but go generally off about groups + idols claiming theyre true hip hop artist. Also he will do a Weekly Idol shoutout

	One member will probably go to either SMTM (~55%) or King of Masked Singer (30%)

	Jin is finally featured in Master Chef Korea

Realised I had no idea, and I cant seem to find any info on it lol, I'm really curious.

I know its a mixture of ages and they all joined BigHit at different times so my question is does anyone know what they studied? Like other than music? How many of them still go to like a highschool or something I know Jungkook goes to SOPA and Jimin also said he got accepted somewhere in Weekly Idol. Where do the rest go (how do they find the time for this anyway?? lol)

Do they study or studied stuff besides dance and singing etc. I think Suga mentioned studying something else before but I cant remember...",4,8,False,self,,,,,

I'm sure BTS would like to see caring comments instead of comments like ""hi"" or ""ok"". Just comment nice things like ""fighting BTS!"", ""I love you guys!"". I'm not trying to be rude, but I care a lot for this fandom and for BTS. Rapmonster said that he wants to have a person to person relationship with his fans and not a fan to idol relationship.

Just so that everyones on the same page, outlined here are the decisions we made, as well as our reasons for why we made these decisions. These [**rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) are in the wiki, which is linked in the sidebar.

Before we start, we just want to thank you guys for being a great and wonderful community. Honestly, there isnt actually any dire need for rules right now, [because you all are just sooo lovely!](https://31.media.tumblr.com/cc8fbb42fb5d47dba3ce7ea7241f6769/tumblr_inline_npxd6gVGxd1tngr8g_500.gif) But we just want to make sure that in the future, this sub continues to stay great (were growing pretty rapidly, after all, which you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/MNfqI); almost at [1000 subscribers!](http://image.dek-d.com/27/0362/6419/118619385)) If you guys were all awful and terrible people, this sub would also be awful and terrible. So good job, and lets try to keep it this way! :)  

Keep in mind that if you see any comments or submissions that break these rules, dont hesitate to use the report button (and preferably tell us which rule it breaks). Theres no penalty for false reports (better safe than sorry), and it helps us mods a lot, because sometimes we miss things too. Were only human!  

*******

#1\. Promotional Content  
Based on what [you guys said when we asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/3wwkqj/subreddit_improvement_thread/cxzhkm4), it seems like you guys generally trust us and our judgement to decide if a promo is legitimate or not. For now well just deal with them on a case-by-case basis.  

#2\. Rumors  
We actually had a hard time coming to a decision about this. On one hand, we dont want to give extra publicity to unverified and malicious rumors. On the other hand, if a rumor is big enough to where its actually affecting BTS or public opinion somehow, we think it would be wrong to prevent discussion about the topic.   
We talked about allowing rumors that are based on more than just speculation and have enough evidence, but different people have different ideas about what is enough, and what counts as evidence.   
Ultimately, we decided that until an official statement is released (by Big Hit/BTS/an involved 3rd party), we wont allow submissions about the rumor. After the official statement is released, the official statement can be submitted and should have a **neutral title**.  
Using the most recent rumor of a manager hitting Jungkook as an example, under this rule, we wouldnt allow any submissions about the topic until Big Hit released their official statement. After that, we would allow BHs statement to be submitted (with a title like Big Hit responds to manager controversy), and if the submitter wanted to include a link to an article explaining the background of the rumor in the comments or something, that would be fine too. But the explanation has to be in the same post as the official statement (to avoid confusion from lack of context).  

#3\. Sexy Stuff  
Uh...this is pretty obvious, but no porn or erotic fanart/fics or sexy photoshop pictures. Period. Just wanted to make that clear before it happens, as its not *actually* written anywhere yet.  
As for something like, a [gif of Jimin at MAMA 2014](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/30/ab/a3/30aba3af5606ee3dc3e1fb200e76a22b.jpg), thats fine, but the title cant be...thirsty. It should follow the submission title format outlined later on in this post.  

#4\. Opinion Articles  

Weve decided against allowing opinion articles. What we mean by that is, for example, a personal Tumblr post thats about how ""BTS songs are the second coming of Christ"" isnt allowed. Similarly, some random bloggers post about how BTS is total garbage also isnt allowed.  

However, things like reviews are allowed, if its in some sort of professional/well-known publication (like [this Billboard review](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/6784945/bts-most-beautiful-moment-in-life-pt-2-run-review) or [this Fuse article](http://www.fuse.tv/2015/06/best-albums-2015-so-far#24)). Also...submit Koreaboo/Allkpop/etc. articles with discretion, as they violate the rumor/opinion article rules a lot.    

#5\. Fan Content  

When it comes to things like regular fanart, song/dance covers, weve decided that we dont need to moderate any of that. That can be user-regulated through upvotes and downvotes. Be nice :) 

#6\. Raw/Eng Subbed Videos  

We considered giving Raw videos their own submission, and when an Eng Sub comes out, its added in the comments (and then the whole post is flaired as Eng 
Sub) to avoid clutter. However, since we cant really know how long it will be until subtitles come out for something, and most people probably dont want to have to check back in the comments of an old post for subs, we decided both Raw videos and Eng Subs can have their own post. If it ever becomes an issue in the future, we can reevaluate then.  

#7\. Exclusive/Fancafe Stuff  

For fancafe post translations, (although we were pretty torn on this lol), weve decided that we wont allow things from the fancafe to be posted here. One of the rules of the fancafe is that stuff in there isnt supposed to be reposted anywhere else. We want to be respectful of BTS wishes, so no fancafe posts allowed here (but we cant stop you from looking elsewhere for it...)   

By exclusive content, we mainly mean stuff like Seasons Greetings/Summer Package DVDs and album photobooks. Things like that. Since thats basically piracy, we dont want to endorse illegal activities here, and again, we also want to respect BTS. But you know, we cant stop you from finding it elsewhere ;) (pls support BTS tho, forreal).   

If you want to share a **short** clip from a DVD (we'd say short is around 2-3 minutes or less) or take a picture of your album that came in, thats perfectly fine. But no full-on scans of photobooks or huge chunks of DVD footage allowed.  

#8\. Submission Titles  

Weve decided to be a bit more strict on submission titles. You can find the format of what the titles should look like in the [**wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules). (FYI, Korean date format goes YYMMDD. So December 16, 2015 would be 151216).   

Please dont self-create your own flair in the title (such as adding [VID] in the title), as we want to actually flair it so that the nice little tag will go in front of it for easier sorting. Users *can* flair their own post, but if you dont know how, leave it and we will do it for you. Theres also a guide to flairing submissions in the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faq).     

If the format of your post title is little off, well just pm you a reminder for your next post. But if its significantly wrong, well remove the post, which brings me to a great transition.  

#9\. Removed Posts  

If one of the mods removes your post, we will leave a comment on the post explaining why we removed it. If its because of the title format, we will tell you what you need to change in order to resubmit it.  
If your post is removed and you dont see a comment, that could mean:   
1. The spam filter accidentally picked it up, so send us modmail and well try to recover it.   
2. We forgot to leave a comment/it didnt show up for some reason. Send us modmail and well tell you why it was removed.  
So either way, if you dont see a mod comment on your removed post, send us modmail lol.  

#10\. User Flairs  

Weve decided to allow all users to set their own custom flair (separate post about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/3x1vml/flairs_changes_from_subreddit_improvement_thread/)) because [were all about fun](https://41.media.tumblr.com/58870abf86fb94544cba3f06d87171e1/tumblr_nzf9ymnsMK1utvyajo3_r1_250.png) here at /r/bangtan! If people start using inappropriate or offensive flairs, well warn them, and if they dont change it, we will then ban them.   

If inappropriate flairs start to become a huge problem, then well change it back to how it was before, with preset flairs only. Not fun.  

#11\. Census  

The census was already done for [this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/3svfvp/poll_rbangtan_census/), but we decided that an official yearly census will be done on December 1st. Its a nice, neat date at the end of the year. pls anticipate for next year  

*******

Thats all for the new rules we decided on; thank you for reading!

I thought it would be fun to see which Kpop songs made it onto your year-end list! This of course includes non-BTS songs as well. I just finished watching JRE's video of his top 15, and I really appreciated it as a new Kpop fan...I've been inspired to look up a lot of different artists. I'd love to get that from you all as well- especially more female singers/girl groups!

Here are my top 10 songs:

10) [Jay Park- You Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L0wWKuWAd4)- Only audio...the video's NSFW. I love how shamelessly terrible Jay Park and Okasian are in this song. It's like a Kpop fuckboy anthem, and I dig it so hard.

9) [Dynamic Duo- Jam ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbTOhfJYQkc)- This song is such a jam! I can listen to it nonstop. I really love Dynamic Duo, and Gaeko especially- he's a fantastic singer, imo. Edit: Admittedly, I linked the video before watching. It's...interesting, ha. I loved the BIGBANG references!

8) [Seventeen- Mansae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gDYkYIApNQ)- Ah, this song! It's such an infectious, feel good song. And the dance! So great...makes me really happy. I hope Seventeen goes far- I'm definitely a fan. 

7)  [Got7- Just Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrdk3IGcau8)- I really loved Got7 immediately upon first listening to them, kind of the way I fell in love with BTS. This song was pure cuteness, and I still can't get enough. I love singing along to this more than any others they came out with this year. Also, JB. That is all.

6)  [iKon- M.U.P.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C00zLmL4wQ8): I love the lyrics in this song, and it sounds really optimistic. Makes me really happy :)

5) [Big Star- Full Moon Shine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxYsDHgHItg)- I love this song *so* much. It seems like Big Star isn't that popular, and I can't understand why...I think they're pretty talented and adorable. I've played this song non-stop, and I love the dance practice, too.

4)  [Red Velvet- Automatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px2Q47O0_eE)- I adore this song, and think Red Velvet sounds the best ever here. I really like R&amp;B-esque songs, so it was right up my alley. I'm excited to see if they'll produce more songs like this- I can see myself being a long-time fan.

3)  [Zion.T- Eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibb5RhoKfzE)- It was really hard to choose between this song and Zion.T &amp; Crush's ""Just"". But this song won because, while short, it's packed with a heartfelt message, soothing vocals, and the video is super cute to boot.

2) [BIGBANG- Bang Bang Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw)- This song is the one that turned my world upside down and got me into this entire genre of music in the first place. I'll forever love it (and G-Dragon) for that reason.

1)  [BTS- Autumn Leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdduh-Mvpi8)- Linked to a color-code/lyrics vid because I am in love with lyrics, and I really love knowing who's singing each part. I especially love watching just to know for certain that I am hearing Jin at the very beginning. I don't know why, but I think his opening line for this song is one of my very favorite things BTS has done this year...he just sounds so beautiful. I can't even explain everything about this song that I adore, just that I'm so grateful this piece of art exists. Also, the only reason I didn't choose House of Cards is because it's so short. Let's just say it basically shares the #1 spot with Autumn Leaves. ",20,8,False,self,,,,,
