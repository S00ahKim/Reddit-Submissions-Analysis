Additionally, the idols Instagram/Twitter/Fancafe/etc posts are an extension of these characters, those posts are for the fans and are therefore done, again, in character.

Im paraphrasing, obviously, so its entirely possible that Im completely misunderstanding what the podcast hosts were really trying to say/explain. Please forgive me!

Anyway, all of this has got me thinking.and being the chronic over-thinker that I am, I have some questions/existential concerns:

a)	Does BTS have a concept theme for their group? If so, what is it?

b)	Are the BTS boys all playing characters? If so, what are their charactersi.e., who is RM, who is J-Hope, etc? (Just to clarify, I dont mean like, RM is the group leader and main rapper.)

c)	If they are indeed playing characters, then where is the line drawn between, for example, V the character and Taehyung the real person?

\-	Sub question: In all these posts that we all make in which we talk about their personalities, how sweet or sincere or savage someone is, etc, how do we really know these things to be true as opposed to them just being in character?

How do we know anything? HOW DO WE KNOW????",3,0,False,self,,,,,

Would like to preface this by saying that I'm a Southeast Asian army fluent in English, Mandarin and proficient in Japanese. I'm curious to hear people's evaluation of the linguistic abilities of BTS members.

Clearly Joon is skilled in that area because he picked up English on his own. I'm not sure if Joon is considered to be on the level of a native speaker? During this round of promotions/ concerts in the US I could tell that Jungkook and Hobi's English improved significantly, and I'm sure the rest are working hard at it too. 

Jungkook sounds really natural when he sings in English, and for Japanese songs Jin sounds the best out of the vocalists to me. I feel like it's especially hard to rap in Japanese as non-native speakers since different languages sort of have their own flow and intonation. At least for the vocal parts you can follow the beat and melody. Joon sounds very similar to me regardless of which language he's rapping in. Out of the rapline I'd say Hobi's the most natural in Japanese songs.

I noticed that Jimin and Hobi feature in Japanese promotions quite often and they seem to have a good command of the language. For Mandarin, to be honest Hobi is the only one I can understand without a problem lol. It might be because intonation is very important in Mandarin and it's hard to grasp for non-native speakers. In fact, I'm starting to think that Hobi has a natural gift for languages and an ear for intonation. I noticed that he really puts effort into preparing his closing speech in the native language during concerts. 

If anyone has thoughts on how their French/ Portuguese/ etc. sounds, I'd be interested to know.",5,4,False,self,,,,,

I was wondering whether *Shadow* would explore BTU darkness or Bangtan darkness. It seems to me that every member has a gripping darkness or shadow that could make for a compelling album, except Kookie's seems most mysterious. 

For example: 

* RM -- tension between rapper/idol; wondering about his place in the world
* Jin -- insecurities and struggles about having debuted the least experienced of the lot; filial acceptance 
* Yoongi -- hardships during his early years; combating haters; struggles moving through his idol career as an introvert 
* Hobi -- the stark contrast between Jung Hoseok and J-Hope; navigating being the sunny idol and what he wishes to communicate about his deepest self 
* Jimin -- perfectionism; body/self-image struggles 
* V -- combating so much loss at such a young age

But then we have Kookie. 

I have seen posts suggesting that Jungkook laments his lost childhood, but I haven't really seen this being supported. He's claimed that his greatest hardships were always watching his hyungs suffer. I wonder if there is a shadow inside of him that feels this need to be the perfect idol, or construct an identity that the fandom won't see as just a combination of his six brother's personalities.

So, I don't know much about BTS. However, my younger sister is a massive stan of theirs, and earlier today she mentioned how she couldn't find the Agust D CD album anywhere. I just wanted to ask if you guys know why it seems to be impossible to find (I've tried looking on [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca) and multiple other basic locations, but I cannot find it.) I'd like to get it for her, I just have no clue what-so-ever about where and how I could obtain a legitimate copy of it.

In any case, I hadn't ever  that theme in any of the kdramas I had watched until now. Moment at Eighteen reminded me of it right away, and for some reason it makes me think about BTS a lot, so I figured I'd come here and ... muse lol.

I'm going with 3 other people and we're planning on lining up a couple days ahead...  This is my first time going to this kind of event though. I was wondering if anyone did it last year and has any tips??

Or anyone who has any general tips about camping out over night from other shows!

Mainly: one girl in our group isn't getting until a night later, can she join us after or will we need to get someone to stand in for her?

And 2: I have 2 exams sat morning, I'll need to leave the line for 6 hours...will I need a stand in, or will my group be enough?

Any tips/info appreciated! Thank you!",5,29,False,self,,,,,

Anyway, while I look into this and somehow remake this whole thing from scratch (hopefully before Shadow comes out), Ill just take the opportunity to elicit feedback from this subreddit. Ive changed some things because of your insights before!

The purpose of this video is to offer a condensed view of the BTS eras to new fans or journalists unfamiliar with BTS.

And I just couldnt help but think as to why BTS dont release MVs like that with all the material they have, because man if they did I dont think I could stop myself from actually shedding a tear or two and Im sure its something we would all love.

Ive also found that its a lot easier for people to feel awe and get interested in an artist when they see other people reacting positively to them, they are more willing to check them out.

However for newer songs eg. Boy with Luv and Home, the rap feels like an afterthought. Im wondering if its because these songs were written by external songwriters who only do the vocal parts and the rap line add their verses at the end, which makes their job very difficult.

I observed that many Youtube reactors seem to have no context about K-pop/ Korean culture and society in general when getting into content about BTS. Sometimes they make comments that bother me. It's odd because many people where I'm from watch American/British TV shows and are exposed to Western media in general, whereas the opposite doesn't seem to be the case. I'm wondering if I'm being oversensitive but I would like for people to at least do a bit of research so that they don't say things that sound ignorant/misinformed. Maybe I should be happy that BTS can be a stepping stone for them to learn more?

I have a loyal group of army friends who also happen to be Monbebes (Monsta X stans). We had a discussion after their Monsta X concert recently about how they do more for their international fans and are more intimate with their fans than BTS. They said that Monsta X holds hi touches after their concerts, make efforts speaking English, and are on V-Live all the time, trying to connect with their fans. 

There was a lot of back and forth with points coming up about how BTS is much bigger and maybe could not reasonably hold hi touches after concerts due to security reasons, BTS members dont feel as comfortable speaking English, and having other ways to connect with fans (i.e. songs dedicated to ARMY, always putting ARMY first when it comes to accolades, etc.), and that they are Korean above all so karmy has a soft place in their heart. 

This post is absolutely not meant to be inflammatory but I do wonder some things: 
- it does seem like members respond mostly to just karmy on weverse 
-karmy has more access to BTS aka musters, hi touches, variety tv shows, award shows, music shows, etc. 
-on a surface level it feels unfair in a neglected middle child kind of way when international army has done so much for BTS and we only get concerts (ie no meet and greets, personal stages like Muster, etc.) 

TL;DR
Is it reasonable for I-Army to feel a little neglected compared to how BTS seems so much more accessible to karmy or how Monsta X is with their fan base?",143,0,False,self,,,,,

I am a construction management and civil engineering technology student. I am in an industry where people praise me for thriving in a male dominated field. We need more young women like you, I hear often. However, these same people will often cast a spiteful glance to me when they ask me what kind of music I listen to. To them, it is unbecoming of a woman who is an engineering hopefully consume and avidly enjoy K-Pop. To many, K-Pop is a mindless and even pointless fad that propagates uneducated individuals with little ability but to scream for a pink haired crooner with far too many earrings. 

When asked who my favorite musician is and I truthfully respond BTS, I often receive laughter as a response. They want an artist, not a product, theyll tell me. Someone who makes their own music, not a bunch of trained robots that girls go crazy for... To those who say this to me, they never believe my when u tell them that I, in fact, did not become a fan due to Bangtan Sonyeondans good looks and tight jeans. To them, it is moot when I state that, in the very beginning, I actually had an aversion to BTS because of their looks. When my older sister showed me videos and interviews, I was skeptical, developing an aversion to the men who were too pretty. I could never be a fan of any man who made me insecure about my own looks. Yet, here I am, smitten beyond comprehension. 

In fact, being a fan of BTS has been one of the most empowering experiences of my life. It is an established fact that the group is a mouth piece for the motto of Love Yourself and Speak Yourself. 

Imagine being a young Filipina immigrant, barely in her twenties, chubby, a terrible homebody with an pension for drawing on every possible surface and a love for the means and methods of building skyscrapers. Imagine growing up in NYC, attending schools where you are a minority, where you dont quite fit in within any specific circle. Imagine never seeing an Asian, let alone your specific brand of Asian gracing the media in a highly public and positive spotlight. The only Asians youve seen are either terrible stereotypes or side characters and the ones taking the lead roles are from years ago, forgotten and barely remembered as an outlier. Then theres your self esteem, the media telling you that you arent pretty enough because you havent had a single digit pants size since elementary school. And because you arent pretty enough, then your opinions are subpar... Imagine the impact of hearing from a very public figure very earnestly that you should love yourself. Not because he loves you but because you love you. 

Even in this day and age, where celebrities and public figures tout the motto of being true to oneself, there are very few that live their motto. Bangtan is a rare and beautiful moment in human existence because of the very fact that they defy the popular narrative. They continuously support their fans and urge them to love themselves, not just on some days, but every day. BTS backs this up with their own personal testimonies as well as through their musical subject matters and where they choose to align their philanthropy. Their message is not a one time thing for clout. It is a life style. 

Because of their message, ARMYs across the world have been empowered and emboldened. The mindless tween fangirls are organizing projects to plant trees, clean the ocean, rescue animals and support educators worldwide. The same hysterically young women are actually a band of every race, gender, age and background, crying out their own stories and supporting one another in their hardships. ARMYs worldwide are following the precedent of seven young men who donate silently, give willingly, and sing not of a romantic love, but a love that is deeper. A love that each and everyone of us can experience. 

As an ARMY, I am not debasing myself by loosing my mind over seven Korean men. Instead, I have learned to respect myself and continue to learn to love myself. And in turn, I will see the preciousness of every individual and learn to love them too. I have also learned to practice what I preach. If I wish not to be objectified, then so must I not objectify. BTS should not be reduced to their looks or how their bodies move. I have learned this. BTS, and every human out there is a story waiting el be told. We must only learn to love and love truly and deeply. 

BTS is truly the best and most rewarding thing I have ever had the pleasure of living with.",83,385,False,self,,,,,

However, I wanted to share my story of how such a simple thing like my sister's fangirling over her fave boy group saved me. This can be quite a long post so bear with me.  


I'm an early-20s Filipina studying in the top university in our country (for filipinos who might read this, you probably know which university it is). I started studying there at the age of 14, so there was this notion of me being a genius. At first, it was my source of pride whenever my mom would brag about me, but it became painful for me to study since I constantly get barely-passing or even failing marks on my grades despite liking my degree. I would constantly cry myself to sleep because of disappointment; not because I get such marks but because of my parents' disappointment in me. I knew they love me still, but I couldn't bear to see and hear how disappointed they would be that I can't get such high marks, and their constant preaching that instead of crying I should study more made things worse. I never thought of studying as a hassle before since I enjoy it, but reading my books and attending classes suddenly became painful for me.   


By the time I got in my third year, I was doing so poorly that I realized I wouldn't be able to graduate w/in 4 yrs, despite all my efforts of wasting my whole teenage years to studying. And after 6 years of still being in college, I told my parents that I'm taking a break in studying after our school psychiatrist diagnosed me with social anxiety disorder and chronic depression. I haven't told anyone yet about my conditions, even my sister who I love the most. And so for almost a year I just stayed in our house feeling worthless, enduring my parents' constant snide remarks of how just because I went to college I became a problem child.

&amp;#x200B;

And then one day, I had enough and thought of ending everything right there and then. Committing suicide was on my mind for almost a month at the time, and it was a convenient time to do since everyone except me and my sis is out while my sister is supposed to meet some friends in the afternoon. So, I was surprised when she asked me to go watch some videos of BTS in youtube with her instead, saying her friends moved their meeting to another day. I agreed since I didn't want her to suspect me or something even though I told her before I hated kpop.  


And then, she just made me listen to their songs with lyrics. She was just beside me, looking at my reaction to the music and lyrics while I was like ""it's okay"". That is, until I heard their song Whalien 52. Looking at the lyrics, and realizing my own loneliness from the lyrics just made me tear up and cry like a baby to her. I then told her everything and how I just wanted to die that day.  


Later on she told me that she didn't know how to make me realize that I'm not alone in this lonely world, because just talking to me upfront like that would make her a hypocrite since she never had to be pressured by our parents. So she made me listen to all that songs in the hopes of at least cheering me up and reassuring me (while also converting me to be open to kpop songs).   


She then said something that I would never forget: ""Somewhere out in this world, someone who is like you wrote this songs. Songs like this, irregardless of language, kinda makes you realize that someone do understand you. A song is beautiful because it makes you realize that you are understood, and so you are loved.""  


So, yeah, after that I became quite happy, even for just a little bit. At least nowadays I don't feel like dying yet. She was also quite successful in making me an ARMY and lately I've been listening to some other kpop songs as well, mostly Gfriend since my sis is also a buddy. Since this post is quite long now, I'm gonna stop here. But I wanted to thank my sis and BTS for that day, that's all.  


And to all other ARMYs out there, just keep being yourselves. It saved my life, so it might save someone as well, who knows.",1,3,False,self,,,,,

I hope this post is alright, as I just wanted to share my happiness with everyone.

Being a 30 year old ARMY in a country where k pop is still seen as a niche thing from the internets for teenagers is very hard and I hardly have anyone to talk about it. That is, except for my mother, who today became pretty much a 52 year old ARMY.

I became a fan roughly a year ago after stumbling upon a performance of DNA in one of the comeback stages (can't remember which one, but Tae had his beautiful silver hair with the backlight behind him during the bridge), and I just loved the sync, the choreography, the way it was filmed, you name it - and although I'm a k pop fan since SNSD's The Boys, my love for the genre kind of died when Jessica left in 2014 and k pop was buried underground for me. So their performance really caught my attention and I started to watch more videos. Then the UN speech happened and I knew I had been caught up by them lol. 

Slowly I started to show my mother some videos, how I found them so skilled etc. But she casually paid attention to it. She mentioned that ""all of those chinese boys look the same"" but admitted they had a lot of talent. Burn the stage in the meantime was released and I asked her to come with me so I wouldn't have to go alone, she was annoyed but mildly enjoyed it. In the meantime she became acquainted with Epiphany and TTU and claimed them her favourite songs. LY in Seoul was released and although at first she sighed again she was happy during the movie and left the theater humming her favourite songs. Started to bop her head when I listened to their music, claiming that ""the intro in Tear is mindblowing"". Also started to notice JK and how ""the boy has such a pretty smile"", and in the meantime already distinguished all of them even though never mentioned them by name. Muster happened, and her chin dropped at Pied Piper - started to ask me once in a while to ""play Pied Piper because I like to see them singing"", enjoying some Run episodes etc. Yesterday we went to watch Bring the Soul and no complaints on her behalf, she bopped her head the whole movie and almost got teary eyed when V lost his voice. At first, like in the previous movies, she felt embarassed because the room was teenagers only with the occasional mom, but then she looked behind and a 50 ish year old was watching it on her own (no teens nearby) so she felt more relaxed.

We left the theater and she said ""Let's go buy one of their cds because I want to listen to them while in the kitchen!"" That moment I knew, she had fallen down the rabbit hole xD We ended up not doing so yesterday, I had to work today and when I got home she told me she had spent the morning browsing their videos on youtube (specially Pied Piper lol), something she had never done on her own. Right now we're the proud owners of LY Answer and YNWA under my suggestion and she's grabbing them so she can listen in the car on her way to work! She doesn't say they ""look chinese/look like girls"" anymore and clearly admits her bias is JK and that V does have ""nice facial proportions"". Admires Joonie's wit and laughs at Jin's jokes, Suga's kittiness and J Hope's sunshine persona, and Jimin's flawless dance technique.

Well, it took her 1 year to warm up but now she really is an ARMY. Wow, this post sounds more like some kind of cult haha. I don't know if anyone would like to share some thoughts/ similar experiences with their parents, but I really wanted to share this with someone. Thanks!",48,149,False,self,,,,,

I tried telling my best friend about BTS and I thought she might be a little more accepting but she said 'I think you need help'  I know she was only joking but it did hurt a bit. Especially since she is usually into East Asian culture and has travelled there before. (I guess not pop culture?) 

The movie in Australia is the first BTS type event I have been able to attend and I'm really excited to see it but also feeling a bit anxious about about going alone.

Personally, I find it amusing to imagine what life wouldve been like as an ARMY in middle school or any time really when I had more time. Oh, the things I wouldve done! But I also recognize that BTS happened to enter my life at the time I needed them most, and maybe if things had been different, I wouldnt have the relationship with them that I do. They mean more to me than I ever knew something could mean to me.

Just wondering if any of you had an experience with them you could share, and also if you had any recommendations of where to buy official bts/bt21 merch online! 

&amp;#x200B;

I watched the Bring The Soul movie and there were interesting clips of fans sharing how BTS had impacted them. One of the answers was very surprising to me. I won't go into details incase you don't want to be spoiled!

But yesterday me and my friend were talking BTS, she's my only friend that's an Army really, and when we share memes we always point out how alike we are to the members. I'm very much like Suga and she's very much like Jin personality and height wise. Of course this is for fun and meme sharing. Suga also happens to also be my bias. I really love him. 

Anyhow my friend was commenting on how alike or personalities seem to be. I'm a very calm person, I reserve my energy. I can be chill to the point of uncool. It's hard to impress me or make me laugh, I'm the last one to get in a fun mood. I don't like to be frivolous. I'm way too serious and I can come off as intimidating especially if I'm not in a good mood. 

Growing up, I'd get alot of comments from people about how negative I come off, how cold I seem, etc. I just figured I wasn't like a loveable kind of person. I had a really terrible view of myself and I was always questioning why my friends were my friends. I was always a little untrusting even though they never gave me a reason to be, I just had a bad self image. I was always so critical of myself and just couldn't be satisfied with my own short comings. I've more or less been fighting depression most of my life. It was really hard to just not feel down all the time. Sometimes I could tell if was the real me or was it the depression. It'd been so long that I couldn't tell. ***(Disclaimer: I have no idea if Min Yoongi has depression and I'm not gonna speak to that if he has or not as it's none of my business. I'm just elaborating on my own state of mind and the difficulties I've struggled with.)

Well fast forward to find BTS and Suga. Suga is my bias because I see so much of myself in him. And since discovering BTS and becoming a fan, I started to feel really good about how I see myself. The reason why is because we get to see glimpses of theses incredible friendships. We get to see how they treat eachother and love eachother. I get to see how and why it is other members have love for someone like Suga (who on the surface seems like a grumpy grandpa that bums everyone out. Also Disclaimer: of course I know he isn't those things and people are more complex than we give them credit for) And that in turn showed me how my friends see me. Suga being my bias has been so impactful on my self confidence. Literally showing me how I can love me self!

It's one thing to say the words, it's such a different experience to be shown how. BTS is very special in that they share examples of love and friendship with their audience. And constantly show us how to treat eachother with kindness, compassion and how to really take care of eachother. 


TLDR: BTS has helped me to view myself more positively and to really become my own fan.

Sorry for the novel. I'm literally tearing up. Please share with me if you can how BTS has impacted you!",22,44,False,self,,,,,

I recently checked out Glam, remember them, they were the BigHit group(albeit shared with Source Music)before BTS and holy shit did I fell in love with them.

Their songs are meaningful and have great messages just like BTS's music used to be.

For example Glam's debut song ***[Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd-EnU-s9Rg)*** is the best and so far the only truly lesbian KPOP song that doesn't hold back

just read the lyrics:https://lyricstranslate.com/en/party-xxo-party-xxo.html

&gt;La, La, La, La, La, La, La

&gt;Can I kiss ya baby girl?
 

&gt;You know that look at your charm, its so great even if you fall down, beautiful smile

&gt;Are you a boy? Girl?

&gt;I dont care

&gt;Passion is the key

&gt;A hot heart is your ID

&gt;If youre alone, come here

&gt;Put everything in your hot heart

&gt;Girl I like ya really really like ya

&gt;Now just jump up and leave the rest to me
 

&gt;My training shirt is drenched with sweat

&gt;1 2 3 4 ready to start (Girl I like ya really really like ya)

&gt;B-b-beating Beating Heart

&gt;You and I, we are the same Girls

&gt;Maybe theres no need to win (Come on! Im heartbeat away)
 

&gt;A Kiss XXO

&gt;Anyone can be a Romeo

&gt;A touch of your lips XXO

&gt;If the heart starts to race youre Julie, Juliet
 

&gt;Lets get the Party

&gt;Party started

&gt;Next to you Heartbeat away

&gt;Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na

&gt;La, La, La, La, La, La, La

&gt;B-B-B-Beating away (x2) (Come on Im heartbeat away)
 

&gt;Because we break the rules

&gt;We dodge the Rules

&gt;Got the right to break the wall everyone move

&gt;Opposition for opposition wont work

&gt;Take off the blindfold that covers your eyes

&gt;(Be confident) Were a minority

&gt;(Fling it off) Were ET that came to earth

&gt;You make my heart-heart-heart beat

&gt;Everybody lets Par-Par-Party~
 

&gt;A Peace XXO

&gt;Just hug everyone Only Love

&gt;A touch of the heaven XXO

&gt;Just shout out

&gt;Oh-Aye-Oh, Oh-Aye-Oh
 
&gt;Lets get the Party

&gt;Lets get Party
 
&gt;G-L-A-M

&gt;My heart calls you,

&gt;Jump up roll your feet

&gt;G-L-A-M

&gt;Your heart calls me

&gt;Lets start the party for love
 

&gt;Yeah (Party is heartbeat away)

&gt;Dont stop the beat now

&gt;Now is the time

&gt;You shine more than anyone else
 
&gt;Start the Final Countdown(Party is heartbeat away)
&gt;Touchdown above the blue sky
&gt;Lets burn this earth, lets burn it all, lets burn it all
 
&gt;Party is heartbeat away (Oh~, Oh~) (x4)


Similarly, their other songs ***[I Like That](https://genius.com/Glam-kr-i-like-that-lyrics)*** being a song about being ok being alone after breakup or being single in general has just as meaningful and relatable lyrics.https://genius.com/Glam-kr-i-like-that-lyrics

And their last song ***[In front of the mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PreOQpat5Mg)*** being an emotional song about a girl feeling ugly because she deosn't have the perfect body. And that is a great message that is totally nonexistent in current KPOP.https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2013/03/glam-geullaem-geoulapeseo-in-front-of-the-mirror

Learning about the songs GLAM had and considering the songs BTS used to release, once BigHit's music was trully for healing because it had relatable lyrics and great messages but the massive success of BTS has caused them to only release safe,cookie cutter, GP friendly songs with vague messages and fake deep lyrics.

I mean look at BTS's recent album or TXT's album. I'm not saying those songs are necessarily bad, but they pale in comparison to the meaning full songs BigHit used to produce.",31,0,False,self,,,,,

Aside from the expected quality time with friends and family. What do you think they will get up to?

I think Namjoon will travel overseas again with his family. 

Tae will work on his photography and painting hobby. Maybe go on a photography trip and take gorgeous pictures of nature.

I dont think Yoongi will be able to stop making music and I can see him taking the opportunity to work with people he has wanted to collaborate with but didnt have the time. But I also believe he will have no problem going complete black ops from ARMY and we wont hear a peep from him.

I could see Jin working on his restaurant side business with his brother. Maybe launch something new?

Hobi could work with his sister and brainstorm a fashion line. Maybe a unisex capsule collection?

I think it would be dope if Jimin returned to his roots and take some modern dance classes. Maybe mentor some students in his hometown. I also think Jimin wont be able to stay away from SNS.

Jungkook will continue to develop his film and editing skills. Maybe take a course or find a mentor to help him expand his skill set.

Besides being a typical 18yr old that lives on her phone, I just realized I wont have any access to BTS stuff. If they drop Shadow, I might only be able to listen to a few songs a week. If they go on tour, I wont be able to see them.  

As yall know, BTS do a LOT of stuff. Concerts, movies, music, award shows, Run, the list goes on and on and on. I know theres always a fear of missing out but Im REALLY gonna miss out on EVERYTHING.

If you aren't familiar, read alongs are just bookish events where people make an effort to read a certain amount in a certain time.  You can all read the same book, or different ones, rules can be strict or loose.
For this, i was just thinking of something loose and casual.  The Vancouver Public Library has put together a post of NJ's books (https://vpl.bibliocommons.com/list/share/1338249780/1429564517).  Anyone who wants to participate can choose as many books from this list as they think is realistic for them, and then try to read them all in September.

   I am working with a fairly new company based in South Korea called KPOP 4 Seasons magazine.   They'll be creating meticulous high quality products and merchandise and I will be managing their North American sales.   I don't exactly know how Reddit works and am learning how this community works as well.   I just want to get our name out there but not intrude or violate any community guidelines so I am posting this here today.    

My question is, how can I contribute enough so that my promotions of product or the company in general don't just become shameless plugs for business?  

Am I even allowed to promote my business on this platform?  I've tried looking for a marketplace but I haven't come across one...  Not exactly sure how this works so any advice or direction would be much appreciated!   

Here's a youtube video about product and company if any of you are interested in checking out.

I personally really enjoyed watching how carefully crafted the sets were for Singularity even if they did not show much in the MV !!! I also loved witnessing how the more technical parts of the MVs were set up , like with the rain in Epiphany. As for the concert Behind the Scenes , I haven't watched everything yet due to time constraints but , like with the movie , I loved watching them in a more natural environment and getting to see their hard work firsthand as well as their interactions and how attuned they are to each other's presence . And the snacks scenes are always quite wholesome.

I was fortunate enough to snag a ticket for the LY:SY Final concert on Sunday, 10/27! I vowed that this would be the very first time I leave the U.S. if I got lucky, and it looks like fate is telling me it's time!

Some questions I'm wondering anyone has encountered:

* Most more affordable flights seem to have layovers in China, under 24 hours (which I'm not opposed to). I am just submitting paperwork for my first passport tomorrow. From what I've gathered, I won't need a visa for the short layover in China, but are there other requirements I should be worried about? Some things I'm reading say I need to have the passport longer to have the 24 hr stay, or that I need to alert the airline that I don't have a visa. Others say it doesn't matter since I don't plan to leave the airport. Has anyone gone through this recently?

* I've read that google maps isn't the greatest in Seoul and something about Naver maps (?) being better. Any advice on navigating?

* Is the Olympic Stadium centrally located to most of what the city has to offer? Trying to figure out where to stay, and I'm curious if staying near the stadium would make things easier or harder for the other few days of sightseeing. (I can look this up, but I know others might have better input).

* How's the crowd at Korean concerts? I've had tons of experience with every possible kind of US crowd but I know it shifts from culture to culture.

* Anything else I should know? Recommendations for sightseeing, food, etc? Hit me with anything! 

I'm so excited and any advice would be appreciated, and if anyone would like to meet up, I'd love to! Thank you! ",2,2,False,self,,,,,

Some of them are frequent visitors of a psychiatric clinic nearby or are in therapy somewhere else. I'm planning to maybe do voluntary work there for a year. 
I was wearing my BTS earrings and also my pants that I had drawn the LY:Tear album art on the pockets.
This one 13 y/o girl noticed my earrings right away. Then I showed her the art on my pants and she freaked out and said she's so happy to meet me because there are barely girls in this school and almost nobody who liked them here. They rather make fun of her for liking them.
We spend the break talking about BTS and she literally couldn't stop talking. She told me that she's so happy I'm here and that she doesn't want me to leave so that she can talk to somebody. 
She also told me that she used to get bullied but when she discovered BTS they taught her how to accept herself and that they make her happy.
Seeing me openly walking around with the merch without being ""embarassed"" she now wants to start wearing her BTS shirts to school.

This encounter made me really happy and I am know more convinced to start working there :)

And he is currently enrolled for a Master's degree at an online University different to the other members that has no arts - related courses , except for Design , I believe. He also mentioned that he is a singer and loves performing and that those moments on stage are the happiest times in his life . He used to mention wanting to act if the opportunity presented itself before but that he was mainly invested in Bangtan at the moment and then he stopped mentioning. But the other members have been hyping his acting skills a lot lately and he was really good during the BTS WORLD game. How likely is it that he would pursue an acting role in the near future? They have a really loaded schedule because of their popularity right now and there is also the impending enlistment . Has there been any recent interviews were he has said something about his studies or acting ? Do you think he would try other things post Bangtan ?",20,47,False,self,,,,,

Theyre unlike any artists ive ever admired before (and im a hard core arianator) theyre so real, open, and honest and put themselves out there for the world to see. I fell in love with their origin story and admired how they came out so strong despite all the hard times they faced. For them it was all worth it because they just wanted to do what they loved. It was so inspiring to me and i came across them at a time i really needed this type of attitude or vibe if you will. I just graduated college and had no job prospects, no money, and no friends. I was begining to question whether my degree was a complete waste of time and even questioning myself. I had no faith or courage in myself and i didnt think id ever become successful or be happy the way i used to.  I realized the other day that each time i watch one of their RUN BTS videos, or any type of content, post, etc from them that im smiling and laughing and i suddenly feel like everythings going to be okay. These boys have really made a lasting and meaningful impact on the person i became and am still becoming now.

BTS taught me how to love myself, how to keep pursuing my dream, and how to keep going even when its tough. I look back on how they came into my life at a reallly low point in my life and im really thankful for that. I thought id just share just a summary of my story with them because I read posts on this sub all the time about the happiness these men bring to us fans. Even though im a newer ARMY i will stan and support BTS for the rest of my life.

This year, we did it a little differently and let ARMY vote on the theme for the organizations we find for each member's birthday. We ran a survey for the first 3 upcoming ones (Jungkook, Jimin, and Namjoon) and will be doing another one in a few months for the rest of the members. The two most voted causes for JK were physical health and anti violence and trafficking. 

So, this month for #StrengthenWithJungkook, we are working with the Helen Bamber Foundation. This nonprofit supports the victims of human trafficking, torture, and other extreme versions of human cruelty to achieve sustained recovery.

Our secondary activity this month is helping ARMY to take small steps to lead a healthier life in whatever way works for them. We created planners with example activities to encourage ARMY to help create better habits. We just want to encourage people to set and complete small goals in regards to their physical or mental health. We are also encouraging people to share photos or videos of their activities like their own GCFs. 

More details and weekly planners in this thread- [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1157407069819080705](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1157407069819080705)

Separate from the birthday projects, we are running a friendly competition to collect grains on Freerice, so that the BTS ARMY team goes up the rankings. We have created teams for each of the seven nations of Dream World (the songs from MOTS Persona), having ARMYs join one, and then updating each week on how the teams are doing.

Instructions and codes to join teams here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1153489102618189824](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1153489102618189824)

Keep an eye on our twitter as we will be announcing another long term project later this month!!

Im finding it a bit of a shame how much the essence of the other six boys personalities is getting lost in Joon not wanting to/having the energy to properly translate what theyre saying. Using the Radio Disney interview for an example, there were two instances I found a little sad  JK explaining how he discovers an artist, the method he uses, and Joon condensing it all down to Yeah he just likes Billie Eilish. And then with the style inspiration question, although the boys didnt answer the specific question, Joon did gloss over their answers about personal style and just gave a blanket They explained their personal style answer. I feel like at times he gets a little embarrassed or wearied of their answers and doesnt want to pass them on, but by doing that the personalities and their quirks are getting lost. Not everyone is going to look up the eng sub versions of their interviews. 

I mean, I get it. The burden is on him. Its not easy, and this isnt at all me complaining about his efforts. Rather Im sympathizing and suggesting maybe its better to give him a break for a while? And use a translator for the answers the other guys cant give in English. It might also help them with their English more, hearing their exact words translated to English. Thats a big help in my bilingual household.

But as you are distracted with other stuff, there's a **views battle happening on YouTube**. 

The Brazilian Army got 3 Million views to DNA in 3 days - along the the help of some other international Army in a smaller quantity. But we can't get the MV to 1 billion alone. 

Currently Blinks have Ddu-Du-Ddu-Du at 9 million views, while we're still at 8 million. But Blinks wouldn't be able to make it if everyone get together and start streaming DNA. 

**ATTENTION: this is not a fandom war with the Blinks! We only want more people to help us achieve the 1 billion views by streaming DNA!**

We know that the boys and our fandom both deserve this landmark as as a reward for their and our hardwork all these years.

Earlier today I posted here asking for some help to stream DNA, and I got a lot of responses. Some of them helpful, some other not at all, so I decided to clear things up so there will be no further misunderstandings - mainly with people from other fandoms. 

**NOT A FANDOM WAR** 

To begin with, an user here accused me of wanting to start a fandom war, adding that I was trying to take another group's accomplishment for the sake of being ""number one, the first"". **That is not true at all**. 

If you have been on Twitter this past weekend, you would know that #DNAComebackOut was on Brazil's trending topics the entire weekend. In it, the B-Army was talking about how they wanted to give the landmark of *First K-pop Group To Reach 1 Billion Views On YouTube* to BTS. 

As a *gift*, since the boys are on vacation and not promoting anything.  

We could have picked Boy With Luv, if we wanted a fandom war, and then streamed it until we made sure that we would get all the awards there are left this year. But we chose DNA, a song that was released last year.

**PETTY BLINKS** 

Some Blinks, and I say some because I know that not everyone is agreeing with this kind of behavior, got upset with the idea that we could supass Blackpink and started to **report** us. Then they started streaming all of Blackpink's MVs at once. Not only one, but all of them. And they even celebrated when Kill This Love surpassed Mic Drop. 

I am also a Blink, and if it was the other way around and there was another group trying to take away the girls' achievements, I would have defended them. It doesn't make sense at all for me to try to start a fandom war. 

But, yes, I hate pettiness, those Blinks didn't even care about their views until they heard of our goal. So, of course, I got upset. But despite that, I still  everyone to not report them back. We don't need to lower our level. 

**ORGANIC VIEWS** 

I know they are better, but again, it was supposed to be gift. Since the video was far from 1B. The talk about organic views, though, is something that you hardly can use with K-pop acts. So, it is okay to stream BWL and get all the awards that ""organically"" could go to other K-pop groups, but it is not okay to try to reach the 1 billion landmark? I'm sorry, it just doesn't make sense. Either you agree to non-organic views or you don't agree to them at all - otherwise, no offense, but you'll just sound like an hypocrite.

**BOY WITH LUV STREAM** 

Either way, the Brazilian Army is going to continue streaming DNA. It is something that we really want since we got 3M views in 3 days on our own. But, we are still streaming Boy With Luv. If you do it on a loop it won't count anyway, so be patience with us. We are doing our best. 

If you guys set eyes on a specific goal to Boy With Luv, I think you should spread the word among fandoms of different nationalities. That is the fastest/less frustrating way to do things. I though about doing some banners for Twitter (such as this one) and so on. But that will really depend on whether they are useful or not. I am available to translate anything you guys need to the B-Army, though. 

**THAT'S ALL** 

Again, nobody had bad intentions in this. I did not create this post to target anyone, I am only clearing things up. Thank you for reading.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

She always prided herself in *never* jumping on bandwagons. Yet, there she was, eating up the hype of a colossal social media presence. My older sister is what we would call a Theory ARMY. She loves the nuances and story lines and hidden messages coded within Bangtan's content. At the beginning of my journey, I was very much a casual spectator. I never delved too deeply into the videos in hope of keeping K-Pop at a controlled arm's distance away. 

However, some time back in grade school, I was told to cite my sources, and it has stuck ever since. I didn't want to enter a fandom without knowing the source, the background info. I wanted to read of the group's inception, their message, why they had the stage names that they had, and most especially hear the music that they put out from top to bottom. (It was like an obsessive comb through the social media handles of a possible future lover.) 

I distinctly remember turning to Wikipedia first to wet my appetite, then to searching their discography and the order of their albums. I put the albums in proper chronology and gave it a go. And oof, let me tell you. It was rough. At the time, I was listening mainly to indie, show tunes and pop punk. I had delegated hip hop to be a sound that was personally not my go-to. I wanted to keep an open mind, so I powered through the Pacer Test DJ Friz feature intro and held my breath for the-- now familiar-- twang of the opening of the first song track. I listened to the whole album and felt iffy. 

I told my sister so and she looked at me quizzically. Apparently, she hadn't gone farther back than HYYH Pt 2 at the time. I felt oddly proud that I had gone the more circuitous route and patted myself on the back for being an intellectual. I then continued to continue through my journey, mildly uncomfortable in a genre I was unfamiliar with. 

It must have been the Dark and Wild  songs that I switched up my listening and began to look up lyric translation videos. It wasn't until then that I realized that I was missing out on a huge percentage of Bantan's musical presence. I had heard my sister consistently rave about how their lyrics were uplifting and had a message, how I'd enjoy it since, like her, I enjoyed a good lyric. But it wasn't until the boys' first full length album that I listened and understood. 

Up until that point, I was just hearing noise. But when I began to really take in their lyrics, I found that they reflected my feelings. Not currently, but what I had felt a few short years prior as a confused and lost high school senior. And as I continued deep into the Most Beautiful Moment In Life's, I felt the feelings I was feeling at that particular junction of my college aged life. 

As j-hope is tasked to explain: ""Bangtan means to be resistant to bullets, so it means to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets, to preserve the values and ideal of todays adolescents.""

I had heard this explanation and half heartedly accepted it without actually understanding it. But as I slowly listened and read the lyrics of Bangtan's songs, I began to piece it together. 

It is easy to read or hear the definition of Bangtan Sonyeondan as given by Jung Hoseok as to mean only the hard to swallow pills of youth-- The depression, isolation, the social pressures from all across the board. With this reading, then, many begin to criticize their earlier works, crooning to women about their [""sexy mind and... sexy body""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL0ECRo-rks) as cringe worthy and mis spoken words. Many want BTS to stick to one thing-- either be air head crooners, doting over the looks of a pretty girl walking by, or to be woke and socially present. 

But what I learned through listening to BTS chronologically and somewhat skeptically, is that the aforementioned two are two sides of one coin and that coin is youth. There is no young person in this world not enthralled by the prospects of romance or, if not,  the attention of their peers. But those same young people also face a crisis of identity and lack of self love. 

To speak for myself, I am 21 years old and I can confidently say that I am both worried about whether I will be perpetually single forever, whilst still being very aware of how messed up our world is and how we can change it. 

Listening through Bangtan's discography, we can see how BTS has shown the progression and growth of a young person. They have never let one side of the coin of youth decide their fate. Instead, they have found the way that both sides have offered value. 

In their earlier works, we hear more love songs and even some songs that offer an objectifying lens towards their object of affection. Namjoon even had a phase of calling people ""Bitch."" They have since rectified the derogatory lyrics and even educated themselves on their past sexism. I spent much of my earlier teenage years very much worried about getting the attention of a possible romantic interest. If ""Sang Namja"" were perhaps ""Sang Yeoja,"" I would have the perfect soundtrack to my early teenage years. 

But no one stays young forever, and what I love about BTS' music is that it reflects this principle. The songs about school pressures and chasing pretty girls melted into songs of self reflection. Except this self reflection was filled with self doubt and questioning about who am I and why am I here in my particular situation? This wrapped itself around a time travelling storyline, which very much feels like the best answer in your younger years. There are so many things you wish you would be able to go back for, things you can change. 

And now, finally, the present. The future of self doubt and focusing on others, rather than your own well being is to look into one's self and find the worth there first. That is what their current era of music calls for. The goal is to love oneself, but that is not the end all be all. That journey is never ending and Bangtan is right there with us as we journey along. 

In all honesty, I just really love that BTS is not stuck on one genre and message that ""sells."" They write to speak and to be heard. Bangtan has spoken to me more than any other artist and more consistently than any other. It is almost midnight where I am, and I am deathly tired as I do my last load of laundry. I have tried to convey my thoughts precisely, though I do think they may be a little muddled. I do hope you can understand my ramblings and this is me signing off.

I have a message from Brazilian Army to everyone here who's awake right now. 

&gt;We have been streaming Boy With Luv and DNA every day. We want to reach 1 billion views, as a gift to BTS, and we want to do it as soon as possible because the awards season is coming. In fact we already have the VMAs in the next 6 days.   
&gt;  
&gt;We decided to get the hashtag #BTSMarathonWeek to trend worldwide - or any other hashtag honestly - so we can get everyone together to achieve that in both videos. It feels like other Army is not streaming at all given that the views haven't grown much lately.   
&gt;  
&gt;Since it's the middle of the week, we understand that everyone is pretty busy. So, we ask you to give your best over the weekend and try to listen to Boy With Luv and DNA at least a few times more on workdays. 

Also... before you get upset at me... 

I talked to them about the DNA situation. It is a 2018 song that is not being promoted this year, and warned them regarding starting fandom wars - we do not want that reputation. The other fandoms already accuse us enough.

But they explained to me that Boy With Luv is still top priority; yet that they really want to make DNA reach 1 billion since it is pretty close already (almost 811 million views). 

We all have to stream other videos in between anyway so that our views in Boy With Luv will count, so it doesn't cost anything to choose DNA for that. But more importantly, let's get organized to stream Boy With Luv in the afternoon or something. I can tell them the time, so we can get the numbers faster and before the VMAs.

&amp;#x200B;

Translation: 

I didn't know much about BTS before shooting an advertisement for Coca-Cola a year ago. I only knew that they became a world-class boy group. It was one problem that there were many cuts to be shot, but memorizing the members names was another assignment given to me. I even had to check their names for each and every cut during the photoshoot. 

Because there were many active, dynamic cuts despite the fact that the photoshoot was done indoor, I was worried about how I could effectively shoot the photos without myself/them getting tired. 

They screamed as best they could when asked to scream, and thought about how they should pose together for group shots. When doing a photoshoot with a group of many members, there are times where there are subtle tensions between the members. But \[when working with BTS\], there was no such thing.

As a photographer, I get energized the most when I feel that we are taking pictures together. Their attitudes were not the passive ones commonly found from celebrity advertising models; they were doing their best for the photoshoot given to them for the day.

I was confident that, if doing ones best with sincerity is what is needed to maintain their high position, BTS will continue to hold their high position. By the end of the photoshoot, I was a fan of them. After the photoshoot, I just kept telling them they are just amazing.

This is why I became an ajuhssi ARMY.

&amp;#x200B;

1. After the photoshoot as we were exchanging good-byes, V came to me and said, shyly, Photographer Oh Joongseok-nim, Im a fan. I also like to take photographs.
2. So my bias is V.

I have a message from Brazilian Army to everyone here who's awake right now.

&gt;We have been streaming Boy With Luv and DNA every day. We want to reach 1 billion views, as a gift to BTS, and we want to do it as soon as possible because the awards season is coming. In fact we already have the VMAs in the next 6 days.We decided to get the hashtag #BTSMarathonWeek to trend worldwide - or any other hashtag honestly - so we can get everyone together to achieve that in both videos. It feels like other Army is not streaming at all given that the views haven't grown much lately.Since it's the middle of the week, we understand that everyone is pretty busy. So, we ask you to give your best over the weekend and try to listen to Boy With Luv and DNA at least a few times more on workdays.

Also... before you get upset at me...

I talked to them about the DNA situation. It is a 2018 song that is not being promoted this year, and warned them regarding starting wars - we do not want that reputation. The other fandoms already accuse us enough.

But they explained to me that Boy With Luv is still top priority; yet that they really want to make DNA reach 1 billion since it is pretty close already (almost 811 million views). *It doesn't matter who does it first*, they just want to hit that number like something you'd see in the OddlySatisfying subreddit.

We all have to stream other videos in between anyway so that our views in Boy With Luv will count, so it doesn't cost anything to choose DNA for that. But more importantly, let's get organized to stream Boy With Luv in the afternoon or something. I can tell them the time, so we can get the numbers faster and before the VMAs.

**Please, be nice in your comments, I like BTS just like everyone here and all I want is to participate in a streaming marathon with Armys from all countries united - since I have never participated in one before.**",9,3,False,self,,,,,

I love his dry sense of humor and his sarcasm.

We already had bts Mattel dolls, a huge variety of bts variety tv and clips including summer package, memories, bon voyage, concert DVDs and movies. We have a subsidiary of bts- bt21 which SELLS. So safe to say, BTS has been intensely commercialised. Commercialisation here not only means producing money making content, but also treating bts as a product. I'm personally not into capitalism: to me it seems like they're extracting every penny they can from people who they know will buy what they produce which to me seems like taking unfair advantage? But I wanna know what the Reddit community feels about that?

Also not criticising the army who buy everything bts produces because it is perfectly okay for them to invest in what they appreciate, I'm just here to discuss. Sorry if the post seems like I'm taking a dig at army. Everyone is free to buy and ignore the product they want to. Just kinda want to know how you all feel about this.",50,2,False,self,,,,,

Hes easy to tease and everyone had fun pretending it was his turn to get a gift but near the end when he gave V his gift I was so touched by how supportive and kind he was of V. Taes face when he opened it you could just tell how much it meant to him and when jimin did his vlive he was talking about Vs song too to hype it up. It was really touching. And then, when jhope gave jimin his gift you could just tell how much it touched his heart. For people like jimin who are really loving and expressive of their love to others it means so incredibly much when they are loved back. It was insanely beautiful to see Jimins face when he was grateful for that CD jhope did for him of his own song and then gave it to the other members. It just reminded me, because I relate to jimin a lot, that being a loving thoughtful person people will love you for it and not just tease you cuz you're easy to tease. Sometimes I get discouraged because it feels like being expressive of my love and care for my friends and family and the people I work with will make people respect and appreciate me less but when I saw what jimin did for V and then what Jhope did for him I was reminded that being myself is the best thing I can be.

As someone who bought previous tour ticket from resale website, my main concern is that, how do i know tickets that gonna be on resale website are from lottery? I heard that if people reselling it and other people buying it, the person who buying it at the end cant enter the venue due to different ID. Correct me if there already system that could help buyer to identify the validity of the ticket. If no, i hope that bighit could provide a system that could let us check whether our ticket valid or not. I dont want many seats become empty. Plus, i noticed that many international casual fans and public want to attend BTS concerts as well, i am worry they dont know about that ticket bought from lottery from different ID not valid.

Bangtan has always profiled themselves as the shield protecting young generations from whatever threatens them unfairly, be it the media, parents, culture (songs like Baepsae or Dope), or themselves (Answer: Love Myself and others). 

One of the main things I feel threatened by as twenty-something young professional are climate change and other environmental problems such as pollution, deforestation, over-fishing, etc. etc. and I was wondering if BTS had ever hinted at these problems. We know several members love nature and/or animals, but I can't remember them ever commenting on environmental topics. 

Note that this is not meant as criticism! While I'd love for them to engage ARMY (can you imagine the power!?) on this topic, they already carry an immensely heavy load on their shoulders and have been a huge force of positive change for so many people. Not to mention that there might be a cultural difference in how nature and the environment is treated and conceptualised in Korea.  I was just curious :)",78,39,False,self,,,,,

why do they play so many games? is it because games provide a good foundation for tv? but half the time watching them play a game is not like..suuuuuper entertaining.

why are the games so complicated? and there are little games within the games.

are games/challenges like a standard thing in kpop?

games/quizzes under duress (after water in the face, on a rollercoaster, on a fast boat, etc.) seem to also be a thing.. what's that about? it seems to test quick thinking, alertness, focus, and rapid adaptation even under physically disorienting/stressful/exhausting conditions. that seems helpful if you want your talent to be able to jump or smile or say 'run bts!' quickly on command. it's like talent training.

anyway, i bet it's hard to be funny and make it entertaining when you have to be filmed playing a fairly standard game, so good job to bts! they are pros.

(i also wonder if there are more little, informal games in korean youth culture than maybe what i grew up with in USA.. some of the games and how they play them remind me of the anime 'asobi asobase', where the characters take little games played during boring after-school club time way too seriously and it ends up hilarious: https://youtu.be/umgJf-r1JyU?t=96 )",19,11,False,self,,,,,

It is related to BTS or BangTan Seonyeondan!! The K-Pop boy group under BigHit entertainment! Okay so in my English class today we read ""The ones who walk away from the Omelas"". Basically Omelas is a Utopian society situated near a beautiful, shimmering sea. When the story opens, the people of Omelas are celebrating the Summer Festival, an annual event featuring games and horse riding. Underneath this happy, picturesque city, a child has been locked in a cage and forced to live in its own filth. The child's suffering is meant to teach the people of Omelas how cruel justice can be and how precious happiness can be. Sooner or later, every citizen of Omelas learns of the caged child's existence and is taught about the meaning of suffering. Horrified, some people walk away from Omelas, never to return. Okay now think about this in the BTS Music Video for ""Spring Day"" where were they? A building what looked like a hotel called ""Omelas"". Six of the seven members walked away from the ""Omelas"" Taehyung was missing and in his solo ""Stigma"" he got trapped in a cage. You see where I'm going here? Taehyung is the suffering child trapped under this Utopian society and once the others being Seok-Jin, Namjoon, Hoseok, Yoongi, Jimin, and Jungkook found out they ran away. Why didn't they take Taehyung with them? Well simple if they did everything would fall apart and I believe that they went back for Taehyung in the music video for ""Fake Love"" and when they did it all fell apart.

I actually didnt know what to look up, so I just searched BTS on YouTube because that was the only K-Pop group I heard of. I saw the Idol MV was the first video so I watched and luckily it was the same song from Rewind. I immediately fell in love with BTS and listened to their other songs. I was taken away by their catchy music and powerful choreography. Now in the span of eight months Ive been to a BTS concert, listened to all of their songs countless times, gotten my mom into BTS, bought so many BT21 shirts, gotten into so many other groups, and I am going to audition for Big Hit.

I've got people tell me it's because they're not that relevant but 1D were one of the biggest artists a few years ago and music critics HAVE reviewed other artists that aren't necessarily ""relevant"".
I've been wondering about it for a while. I always assumed BTS would be ignored by music critics because they were known as a ""boyband"" but their albums have been reviewed a lot (and they've actually got good reviews!). Really wonder how music critics pick which artists they want to want to review/ if they have some kind of prejudice towards certain type of artists

\- A couple of days ago she and the rest of her staff posted insta stories of them on set with a bunch of Korean snacks (this literally made her trend worldwide on twitter because this was confirmation enough for most people lmao)

\-People from a dance crew called the Lab were on set as well and they previously worked with BTS to perform Dionysus at the Rose bowl I believe

\- Becky G started liking a bunch of tweets on Twitter that talked about how she was trending on twitter and how there's a possible collab in the works; she also liked a tweet from an interviewer that once asked her who she would like to collab with and she said bts

\- Hobi and Becky G both said that they would like to collaborate with each other in different interviews

\- BTS asked to see Becky G at the BBMAs

I can't help but notice that a good amount of ARMYs do not like the hip-hop/rap, and I've always found that interesting considering BTS is a group that produces a lot of hip-hop songs. I want to make it clear that my post isn't an attempt to force anyone to like the genre. Everyone has the right to enjoy whatever kind of music they want, but what concerns me are the amount of people who criticize and generalize ALL of hip-hop and rap, especially while they're complimenting BTS's hip-hop songs in the same breath. 

This is problematic because 1. you're generalizing an entire genre of music you know little about because you choose not to do your research about it. 2. Many black people feel this is anti-black because hip-hop is a genre created and popularized by black people and it's not okay to throw black artists under the bus in favor of non-black artists. 3. you're alienating potential BTS fans. Many BTS fans like myself were fans of hip-hop *before* we were fans of BTS and part of the reason why I became a fan of BTS is because they make quality hip hop music but also they have a genuine appreciation of the genre, and they love ALL kinds of hip-hop songs. The ones that talk about drinking, the ones that talk about promiscuity, the ones that talk about gang violence, the ones that talk about politics, the ones that talk about mental health...I could go on. But it seems like some fans don't want to acknowledge this? 

I ask that the ARMYs I described in this post to please stop throwing hip-hop under the bus (especially publicly!) when you're praising BTS because it's a very bad look and PLEASE educate yourselves about the genre and understand that it's not as superficial as they think it is and that there are a lot of artists who create lyrical content that are meaningful (like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Kanye West, Amine, Eminem, Joey Badass, Mac Miller, Tyler The Creator, Logic, etc. Just to name a few.)

become the first BTS (and Korean-language!) album to receive the RIAA gold certification, and in my opinion contained something for every fan, regardless of personal music opinions. The solo songs showcased the individual talents and color of each member while contributing to the overarching theme as a whole, and the group songs continued to illustrate how BTS can be a cohesive unit made up of complimentary but unique parts.

I think IDOL is polarizing among ARMY; many of us (this includes me) love the song, but many others disliked it. For me, IDOL fell into the upbeat summer bop category while spreading the message of the LY series. It had a clear Korean feel, with the traditional instrumentals and melodies (and of course the MV), but the message you cant stop me loving myself really became a stand-out point with universal appeal. It helped that BTS promoted this song heavily in the US, and though it didnt perform as well as Fake Love on the charts, it has become something of a starting point when Western critics discuss BTS because of the combination of the performance and the lyrics. It combines aspects of typical KPop with foreign musical influence to draw in fans from multiple genres. (And there is, of course, the lejindary MMA performance)

Many people talk about HYYH and LY:Tear as major turning points for BTS in the Western market, but I think IDOL and Answer was one as well. Thoughts?",22,63,False,self,,,,,

So, I joined the Japan FC for BTS and will apply for the lottery for 5th muster. I've encountered a problem though, if I win, I won't be able to pay for my tickets, since I won't be in Japan at that time. They've been doing this annoying thing, where you can't pay for your tickets with your card online, but have to go to the loppi machine in JAPAN to pay for them.

I came across ""the best difference in wings to ly answer was the namjin solos"" and how  ""The hug you wanna give namjin for the wings solos are the hugs answer solos give"" and I really agree with that. 

But this got me thinking how I've often read (sometimes as a joke but sometimes serious?) that Bighit has everything planned since years ago, etc. but I don't agree. I mean sure they have songs prepared, etc. but I don't think they have the entire concept prepared years in advance. So as I see it, BigHit had the school stage, youth stage and adult stage covered. Love yourself:Her can stand alone as just a love album because that is a big part of adult life. It doesn't need to progress into loving your ownself or the concept of magic shop which I think evolved with time. 

Love yourself:Her released in mid 2017 but Namjin were talking about 'finding happiness in other people's happiness' and positivity, concepts that are covered by Answer as well as their concert ments in Hawaii BV2. Namjoon was still not sure if he should be happy or sad about creating music for others in 2017. If the love yourself trilogy and entire concept was already mapped out and discussed, wouldn't this topic have come up already? Yet Namjoon was quite surprised by Jin's admission of how he uses people to make himself happy and there being nothing wrong with that. Do you think the idea evolved slowly and gradually as the members themselves learnt to love themselves? I'm not saying that Love yourself:Her was meant to be standalone, just that the closing concept wasn't as fully fledged out and probably evolved with members. I mean Answer isn't exactly the most cohesive album and not all songs fit the ""loving yourself"" narrative. 

Like I said this was going to get rambly but I am confused and would love to hear your thoughts on this as well as what differences between the two eras stood out for you. Like we know MOTS is the era of BTS members being super happy and projecting that but if any evolution really stood out for you between Wings to Love yourself. This might have been covered before but I only became an ARMY post Answer.",20,15,False,self,,,,,

All throughout high school I was plagued with depression and was hospitalized at age 16 for planning suicide. The following years, I was put on several different medications that never actually did anything to help. I continued to cut myself and have frequent thoughts of suicide. Most nights I went to bed either crying or feeling so dead inside I didn't have the energy to cry. Even though it felt like hell, I felt I deserved it and looking back I could see I was looking for any good reason to kill myself. That's when I met her.

There was a girl at my work who I happened to talk to sometime and found we shared some interests and hobbies. Of course I fell almost instantly and asked her out only to get turned down since she had a boyfriend, but oddly enough that didn't get me down. I figured I would bide my time and wait for the relationship to inevitably end, and it did. But I found, to my surprise, that one of my friends at work and from high school was also into her and we spent the next several months trying to be the one she wanted to date.

I'll spare the dirty details, she wasn't into either of us despite the fact we had made out several times and she told me she was into me but had promised a friend not to date until the end of the summer. Well the end of the summer came and instead of choosing one of us, she chose a third guy at work that neither of us really knew that well. This absolutely broke my heart and I bought a rope, wrote a suicide note, and prepared to kill myself. I cut so deeply into my thighs that the scars are still there even after all this time. 

It was the weekend and I was ready to die. I figured I would do it Monday when my parents would be away from the house, but that's when I saw it. A friend on Snapchat advertised that he was selling LSD and I thought ""fuck it, I'll do some before I leave forever"". I had previously done 100ug and thought it was interesting, but not mindblowing. This time I bought 200ug for myself and another 100ug for a friend, but the friend backed out and I took 300ug.

It was a Sunday night and I was enduring one of the most miserable experiences of my life, I could feel myself withering away and hating all the decisions I had made in my life.

Before continuing, it's important to note that she had shown me Kpop and I had taken a great liking to it, particularly BTS and TWICE. I had fallen for her around the time LY Her came out, started feeling alone and lied to around the time LY Tear came out, and now it was the weekend LY Answer came out. Due to everything going on up to this point, I hadn't listened to any of the songs on Answer except Epiphany which I had seen a few weeks prior.

Back to the story, I was starting to come down and needed to drive home, which was about 30 minutes away. On that car ride I played the new album and the messages of loving yourself broke through to me for the first time. I had a conversation with myself in which I accepted the situation I was in and accepted myself as who I am. The LSD broke down the barriers I had put up and BTS changed my life. I cried my eyes out, but not out of the sadness and self pity I had usually felt, but for happiness that I was feeling changed.

After that night, I threw away the rope, burned the suicide note, stopped cutting, and genuinely felt changed. The very idea of killing myself made me feel nauseous. I made up with the friend at work I had hated for going after the same girl and we are still good friends today. The girl and I are on okay terms and I'm actually glad things didn't work out between the two of us, I'm a better person because of it and I can see now I would have been miserable with her. 

Every day I wake up I feel this unbelievable gratefulness to be alive and it feels my life is finally worth living. I am eternally grateful to both BTS and LSD for helping me save my life. I had always felt bitter towards people who said that music saved their life, it wasn't until this experience that I finally understood.

This was my own experience and I do not condone the use of drugs to fight depression as they affect everyone differently, but if you are struggling with depression just know that things can get better and please seek out help.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I recently bought the BT21 necklace with pendants of each member's character. I only wanted MANG though and so I didn't know what else to do with these. They're not expensive so I figured I would do what is said below.

[https://gyazo.com/d878b9c97d5624b734e251f6cd3b7469](https://gyazo.com/d878b9c97d5624b734e251f6cd3b7469)

The first person to reply in the comments with the member they want will have it sent to them for free, including international. No item charge and no shipping charge, the stamps cost like 2 bucks max and I have no problem doing this small thing for Army lol. You will only receive the pendant, no chain. 

Once one is gone I will mark it off and respond to that person. Then just DM me your address and I will send it out to you one day this week with USPS first class international mail. 

However, check this list to make sure USPS ships letters to your country if you are international. [https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immctry.htm](https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immctry.htm)

I personally think DNA looks pretty intricate, and most of all I think it's very fun to watch. Idol looks like an exhausting routine. What other choreographies would you nominate?

Since BTS is on a hiatus until October, a September comeback is impossible. Big Hit announced that TXT will comeback in October so October-November is locked too. All important Korean award shows are in December so I don't think they want a comeback when they have a lot of schedules.

We don't have any information about BTS' 2020 January schedules and Grammys is on January 27.

I think BTS will comeback with Shadow on mid-January and make their comeback stage on Grammys. BTS wants their first comeback stages in important places for them. BBMAs for FL, LY tour opening for IDOL, SNL for BWL etc..",3,0,False,self,,,,,

I have been a fan for a couple of years but I never had the pleasure to meet an ARMY in person. You read a lot about the fandom online, and you find yourself sharing those principals and stories, however I had never met one face to face until my trip to the BTS SY Paris concert. It was one of the highlight of my trip and I would like to share my experience with you.

*I apologise in advance for the long post. I will do my best to make it interesting... ;)*

**Thursday 6th June.**

I was meant to take a train from the South of France to Paris 24h before the concert. I arrived to the station alone as I was meeting my sister in Paris; it is a trip I have done a thousand times as I lived in Paris before so I was expecting an easy, comfortable 5.45h ride. 

Things started to go south 30mins before departure time... the train got cancelled. Trying to stay calm I booked myself on the next train hoping it will actually leave and sat on an isolated area of the station to wait for a few hours. There is were I spotted her, a true JK bias sitting a couple of seats next to me. After 1h of hesitation I found the courage to go and talk to her. You see, unless I tell you myself (which I openly do), you will never guess I am a fan. I know every single inside joke and...yeah I keep them inside.

*""I think we are going to the same concert and there is no need for you to tell me who your bias is""* my first ever pick-up line to an ARMY. We started to chat and for the first time ever, after 2 years of watching and reading about BTS, I was talking about them out loud without the need to over-explain. We talked about their albums, biases, bias wreckers, jokes, ARMY bombs, expectations, songs, MVs,... the whole lot! Out loud! And it was the first time someone called me an ARMY; a sense of pride, freedom and happiness filled me. A real ARMY just called me ARMY. 

She had a group of ARMYs waiting for her in Paris and they had a whole awesome plan for the weekend. She told me she had tickets for both days, including soundcheck tickets for Friday. Here is when I started to get a bit worried.  
Now, soundcheck ticket opening was at 11am Fri. Currently it was 6.30pm and we were still in the south with a 5.30h journey ahead. I knew the trains werent running from Bordeux to Paris from 8.30pm onwards. If this train also got cancelled or severely delayed not sure if she was going to make it to the soundcheck.

Betting my cards, I decided not to break the news to her yet so I dont destroy her excitement unless unnecessary. *Bit of background: even if she is around my age (mid 30s) it was her first time travelling abroad (we are spanish) alone and couldn't speak french nor english so she couldnt understand the info from the loudspeakers.* I kept hearing ""delayed"". 

Our train finally left around 7pm. Severely delayed. 

The train was empty so I told her to come to my carriage as I was alone and that way we can travel together (I had a first class ticket and we both deserved a bit of comfy seating). At this point, I decided to explain to her the situation and told her that I will make sure she makes it to the soundcheck, so we drafted a plan. 

With plan on hand we found the train manager and asked for options: we could spend the night in Bordeux (no hotel provided) and no guaranteed seat on the first train out, or try our luck with the overnight train. The only option to make it on time was the overnight train so we asked for 2 beds on that train. From this moment onward we were a family of 2 travelling together.

I arranged everything with my sister and we called her family together and explained them the situation so they dont freak out *- it was important for them to know she wasnt alone*. During the day she kept getting messages from her friends with updates about the stadium, crew (they actually ran into their backup dancers...) and it was kind of devastating seeing that she was missing all that. So we decided to make the most of it and we spent the rest of the ride to Bordeaux blasting BTS music, taking pics, talking, eating... it was awesome. It was the calm before the storm.

Bordeaux. We got ready to catch the next train leaving at 12.35am. We had booked 2 beds so we should be fine... or so we thought. The train arrived and it was full. I opened every single compartment in that train (yeah, I woke up an entire train...) and I just found scattered single beds in different carriages but we refused to separate. It was 2 or nothing. In case you have never seen a train like this, they have small rooms with two three story bunker beds in each room. You go and claim your bed. Unfortunately not a great plan for 2 ladies #metoo.

12.45am and we keep seen more and more people in our situation, sinking in despair we decided to go find the train manager and ask for the train plan. I knew these trains also had a carriage with open lounge chairs so I asked for the availability and the carriage number - if there was a spot in there it had to be ours. We run the platform like two crazy ladies with JK bunny hears bouncing with us... And Bingo! We found the last 2 seats together. Kind of crowded but we were good to go! The train manager took pity on us and gave us an amenity bag with face mask, ear plugs,... so we did managed to enjoy the 6h hour train ride we had ahead of us.

**Friday 7th of June.**

7am, Friday. We made it to Paris. I booked an Uber for her and sent her directly to the flat with her friends. She was worried that she may be too tired to enjoy the soundcheck but I told her that after taking a shower, having a nice french breakfast, seeing her friends and going to the venue... she would be so pumped up that she will forget the last 24h. And we parted ways.

She made it to the soundcheck. 

She kept sending me messages and live videos during the weekend and we are still in touch. She still thanks me for staying positive during the dark moments and for helping her through the day. And I still thank her for letting me spend the day with her and giving me the opportunity to be called an ARMY.

I am not sure if she is someone I would have befriended if not for BTS and now I have her in my phone as XXXX ARMY and I am in her phone has Txmn2 ARMY. And that is priceless. 

Thanks for letting me share this with you and to all Secret ARMYs out there, I hope you go and interact with other ARMYs if you see them, because you are probably going to win big time. ",1,2,False,self,,,,,

As an Asian-American in my 20s still living in the states, I still get really insecure and self-conscious about my boy-ish looks being really indesireable. That's why Jimin and his body-type (most similar to mine out of BTS) has been so inspiring for me since I'm not some tall, ripped 6'3"" 225lb guy (190cm 100kg).

Im a somewhat new ARMY and Ive been working my way through the BTS discography. I have yet to find a single album or EP that I didnt  enjoy. As Ive listened to the albums, Ive appreciated the ways in which BTS presents concepts for their records and effectively deal with the various aspects of those concepts throughout the their tracklists. After doing some reading online, I found some things that indicate that the concepts of each album after Dark &amp; Wild are all tied into the BTS Universe, whereas the prior albums were not. While I adore their newer albums and how they approach their concepts, there is a part of me that enjoyed the standalone concepts of their earlier work more. At the same time, BTSs artistic growth since their early days is undeniable. This leads me to wonder if there is a chance that, in the future, BTS could do an album heavily oriented around a stand alone concept (that is, no ties to the BTS Universe, and not part of a series like Love Yourself), that puts all their artistic growth since their early days on full display? If they were to, is this something ARMYS would like?",20,19,False,self,,,,,

The prevailing viewpoint is that BigHit should provide English subtitles for its videos.  Id like to present another opinion. 

Heres the thing: I live in a country with two official languages, and work in a sector where things need to get translated all the time.  Translation is not a straightforward process. There can be a number of opinions over the correct way to translate something. I remember an incident (an extreme one, I admit) where there was an impasse among various folks in my office about the correct translation of the term baseline information. On one side were the people advocating for renseignements de rfrence and on the other, we had people wanting informations de base. People were split 50-50 on the issue and nobody wanted to budge. The impasse took a week to resolve! A week! Just for two words that werent hugely important in the grand scheme of things. It was maddening! This case was extreme but, in professional settings, it is nevertheless true that translation usually takes longer than one imagines  -- and costs a lot more -- because of these sorts of uncertainties and disagreements. 

If BigHit were to provide English subs, everyone would want and expect top quality work, but people would likely different opinions on what top quality means. By keeping their materials Korean only, BigHit avoids the following pitfalls:

\- Delays in releasing material due to the type of situation I describe above; 

\- Criticisms (which are likely to be constant and never-ending) from fans about the quality and correctness of their translations. When fans translate their stuff for free, we are grateful for whatever effort they make, and we dont nitpick too much over quality and accuracy. If were not confident in the translation that a fan has provided, we just find another translators work and make comparisons

 Complaints from fans that subs are available in English, but not Japanese, Mandarin or any other language

Personally, I enjoy reading fan-made subtitles, especially when the subtitlers take the time to add cultural context to what the members are saying. 

I'd  love to hear other perspectives on the English subs: yes or no? question.",120,102,False,self,,,,,

I especially loved Jins tuxedo lapels (his overall look really... I mean thats when he became 3rd guy from the left, WW Handsome), the rip in Yoongis pants, and the patterned outfit that Tae wore.  My worst look for them would be [2014 MAMA ](https://twitter.com/moonlight_trail/status/1073534020972105728?s=21).  There are so many things wrong with it but its Yoongis braids that just seals the deal.

When something like this bangtan bomb for BTS at grammy 2019 got deleted, it seem to me like BTS history for being there got erased.

Starting with JK, we have 2 challenge projects:

1. To see how many trees we can plant in 48 hours with $1 donated equalling $1 tree planted
2. To encourage ARMY to be more environmentally conscious, we are creating a map where every time ARMYS do environmentally friendly activities, they can fill out the form and it will get displayed on a global map. This way, we  can see all the actions ARMYs are taking to be more environmentally aware.

For every 50 donors to the tree planting, we will be dropping little gifts for everyone!

So I'm really thinking about getting the membership because of the possibility of it impacting ticketing for the next tours, even though we still don't know when and how it's going to happen. However, I want to wait until BH negotiates lower shipping rates and until we know about more about the raffle system.

On the other hand, the special offer which extends your membership for a whole year ends tomorrow (not too sure how long the membership would last otherwise?? I couldn't find any info). I'm also interested in the ARMY ZIP, and since it starts shipping after the special event finishes, I'm wondering if people who buy the membership later on would even get it?

What are everyone's thoughts? Did you cave in and buy the membership now that the special event is on (even with the ridiculous overseas shipping fees) or are you holding out until you know more?",78,38,False,self,,,,,

2015 = 0.85M

2016 [+1.46M] = 2.31M

2017 [+2.72M] = 5.03M

2018 [+5.15M] = 10.18M


2019 so far added 5.2M as of July (3.5M from Persona, 1.7M from old albums). Assuming Shadow continues the tradition of becoming bigger than the previous album (see Tear/Answer), we may see something like 4M for Shadow and another 1M from other albums till year-end. So their total by end of 2019 could be:


2019 [+10.32M] = 20.5M


Where'll they go from here? At one point, they will have to enlist for the millitary and comebacks will be less frequent. 
Maybe, just may be it's safe to say that 50M is achievable? Idk.
