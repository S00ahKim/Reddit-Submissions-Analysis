I am an avid reader and had tackled some Murakami awhile ago, and was pleasently surprised by Namjoon's reference and interest in Murakami himself. Once rereading the book and listening to the song Butterfly, a lot of parallels can be seen between the two. It makes you wonder what other pieces of literature might have influenced Namjoon. Has anybody else either read Kafka on the Shore or spotted other references to literature in any BTS songs? I am quite impressed with the depth of some of their lyrics. Just thought I'd spark a little BTS related discussion involving a little literature!",30,13

We're continuing the series with Jimin! The idea of this series is to post our favorite pictures/videos/audio etc. of a different member each week, as a sort of appreciation. Hopefully there will be much bias list shuffling and questioning of your faves from these threads. The reason for it being weekly is so that we can really focus in on one member in particular, instead of spreading out among several different members (and possibly being distracted by your bias' thread ;) ). I'm looking forward to seeing some good Jimin-based content!  ",22,38

This person usually announces kpop related stuff in the Philippines, specifically SM (the mall, not agency lol) stuff. Like kpop events in their mall branches and concerts in their SM MOA Arena (where EXO just recently performed). While they do announce official news... I'm still kinda doubting because I don't think BH released any statement about it (... or maybe my google-fu is weak?). Just wondering if anyone here has any other info about their TRB III. (I don't think I would've missed a post on this sub about it???) Could be a fanmeet, but I doubt that even more.

.... Or all ARMYs in my country that are going crazy now are just reading it wrong and ""The Most Beautiful Moment"" doesn't relate to BTS at all....... But its gotta be, right? This means their next TRB is possibly around July/August, right? I should start saving now, right? *We all* should start saving now, right??? ",24,7

I am a new fan to BTS but not new at all to Kpop fandom (although it's been 3 or so years since I've been active) and I have a few questions. Hopefully some kind souls can answer!

1) How are BTS DVDs usually like? I'm hoping their new DVD 2015 BTS LIVE  will be available by the time I'm there, but like I said, I'm new to them so I'm not too familiar with how their merchandise are like. Do their concert DVDs come with subbed lyrics or do they only sub the ments? I try to pay attention as much as I can to their lyrics particularly rap-focused songs so watching perfs without subs will be like watching a Korean drama without subs...it's like, wrong. @_@

2) Are there any umm, places in particular I can go to in Seoul that is BTS-themed? Like any family business- cafes or a Cube Cafe or SM Town Coex like place I can visit? Would the Puma shops have any photo-ops?

3) I cannot believe I'm asking this but err, to Philippine fans, Suga's birthday is coming up, so how organized is the local fandom? Are they collecting letters or gifts or have any projects people like myself can join? Are they partnering with a Korean fanbase to send him anything? Would it be more feasible for someone like me, let's say I decide to send  a gift or letter, to just meet up with a Korean fanbase who are doing a project? Or is it actually possible to drop by Big Hit and give it to some person there directly? I have zero experience doing this for any fandom other than SM artists as my biases usually have family businesses that accept gifts/letters for them, hence my many questions.

Thank you in advance to those who can help!",14,9

Its interesting because this was one of the songs I kinda always skipped over cause it didnt interest me much, but recently I gave it a good listen and I actually love it! (Also im getting tired of my friends always taking selfies I wish they turn off their phones too lol xD)
Same thing happened with Spinebreaker, always skipped it, but then I gave it a listen and I was like DANG SON.

So your current BTS Jam? and do you guys also ahve songs you took for granted before and then soon realised you ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM when you gave them a good fair chance? Happens to me a lot lol. Doesnt have to be a BTS song.",36,15

We're continuing the series with V! The idea of this series is to post our favorite pictures/videos/audio etc. of a different member each week, as a sort of appreciation. Hopefully there will be much bias list shuffling and questioning of your faves from these threads. The reason for it being weekly is so that we can really focus in on one member in particular, instead of spreading out among several different members (and possibly being distracted by your bias' thread ;) ). I'm looking forward to seeing some good V-based content!  ",16,30

166,2016-2-18,2016,2,18,6,46b5mo,Why does BigHit gave Jin parts not suited for his voice?,kim_taehyung,1455745111,"In most BTS songs Jin sings parts that V also sings but their voices are clearly not alike, For example, in War of Hormone, V sings the ""Hello Hello"" well, deep and raspy. However in the second pre-chorus, Jin sings and you could hear V's backing vocals, Jin tries to make his voice sound deep and raspy as well. Another good example is in We Are Bulletproof Pt.2, where Jin sounds extremely awkward trying to sing low.But in https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/cover-by-jin-of-bts, it showcases that Jin has a high pitched voice and a smooth voice. 

P.S. I apologize if I used the wrong technical terms or info, I'm not a professional vocalist, just a fangirl who has done a bit of Googling.",8,10
167,2016-2-18,2016,2,18,8,46br15,Teaser for new Taemin mv totally reminds me of BTS mv style of storytelling,lurburr,1455752199,"After I got done screaming because watching his mv teaser felt like a religious experience -- all I could do was thank BTS in my heart for kicking ass so hard that they're forcing everyone else to step up their game.  Plus they get credit for me even finding his music since I found clips of his Danger MV in a bunch of BTS Vine ""suggestions"" I was scrolling through.

Whenever BTS does a comeback, it will be the first one I get to experience all the way through, and I love that I get to practice with Taemin.  **I do not know how** kpop fans can survive their biases doing comebacks like this - tiny hints with one or two pictures, little snapshots of the song/mv, all of these things so flawless and perfect you feel like your head is going to explode - **and you still have 5 days left** to wait for the damn video.    

So basically, Taemin's comeback now has me obsessing about what BTS will do for their next comeback and just how I'll be able to keep my brains together for that long of a wait - yet I want them to get as much as rest as possible.  *Sigh* the struggle is real.

My kpop addiction keeps me silly and happy, but sometimes it's also a little surprising how it also makes me deeply obsessive.  Am I alone in this???!!",8,4

I actually couldn't sleep because I was so excited...(now I have to go to work without sleep lol)


It was a bit difficult finding the [link](http://ticket.interpark.com/Global/Play/Goods/GoodsInfo.asp?GoodsCode=16001693) , but after some snooping around, I found it!!! (at first it was only available in the Korean website, and it seems that a lot of the international fans, including myself, had difficulties finding the link, so I am hoping that this post would help).


The cost for the membership is 10000 won, and shipping to US (to my zip code anyway) was 50300 won lol. So my order totaled to 60300 won, which is about $49.

I am sure that Bighit chose to do this with Interpark in order to make it easier for the international fans (because I remember how long it took for me to figure it out last year, and I don't read/know Korean at all). But I feel like the way Interpark is set up (I had no clue what interpark is prior to all this, so it was mostly due to that), it was just difficult to navigate...and since it wasn't advertised with a banner link on their front page, it didn't help either.


Anyway, enjoy!

We're continuing the series with Jungkook! The idea of this series is to post our favorite pictures/videos/audio etc. of a different member each week, as a sort of appreciation. Hopefully there will be much bias list shuffling and questioning of your faves from these threads. The reason for it being weekly is so that we can really focus in on one member in particular, instead of spreading out among several different members (and possibly being distracted by your bias' thread ;) ). I'm looking forward to seeing some good Jungkook-based content!  ",28,28

257,2016-2-24,2016,2,24,8,479gd1,Girl with the BTS/Suga sweater at Warwick Arts Centre tonight,shangriilala,1456269643,"First of all Hi. I'm Andrew. I really don't wish to impede on your community here and and if you think this post is at all inappropriate then I understand you have to take the appropriate action and do what you got to do, but I beg you to look inside of yourself and be kind to me. I'm so completely aware of how creepy and stalkery this could come across that I deliberated for a long time over whether or not I should post it, but I just had to.

I attended a stage show of Lord Of The Flies tonight (Tues 23rd Feb) at the Warwick Arts Centre in the UK (a lot of you won't know what I'm talking about at this point but please stick with me). One row in front of me and sligtly to the right was without a doubt the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I actually found it pretty difficult to concentrate on the show knowing she was there. This girl was wearing a BTS sweater, or more specifically a BTS/Suga sweater (which means not only was she truly stunning but very awesome too, right?).

I guess I'm posting this in the hope that by some miracle she visits this subreddit and might notice this and even if she does, I'm not entirely sure what it could possibly achieve but I honestly couldn't think what else to do, and I had to do something.

If you do read this, girl with the BTS sweater, I'm so sorry, please forgive me. You probably noticed me looking at you. I tried to not do that, but it was hard. You were completely beautiful.",14,44

261,2016-2-24,2016,2,24,19,47c07y,On Taehyung acting and why Jin should be kept out of it,lofticried,1456310660,"This is a little rambly, so sorry for that.

So, ever since the news of Taehyung acting has broke out, I've seen rather mixed reactions. Sure, there are a lot of people who support him, but there are much, much more who are [either confused](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.co.at/2016/02/bts-v-to-make-acting-debut-with-hwarang.html) about it or end up bringing Jin into it. Bringing Jin into it ranges from ""When will Jin get to act"", ""Why isn't Jin first"" over to the (in my eyes rather extreme) ""Jin deserves better"". 

I get it, I really do; Jin mentioned that he wanted to become an idol because he thought he might get more acting opportunities that way. When the boys were asked about acting in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yep9t6PsGyY), they immediately mentioned Jin first. Hell, even when I first read the news, I thought of him first. I think you can't avoid that, because Jin's known for it in this fandom; it's his brand, so to say, just like how you'd immediately think of Yoongi when it's about producing.

But there's this: Taehyung has mentioned just as often that he wants to act. For exmaple, in the very first episode of Rookie King, even, he acted out a scene from a historical drama when they were asked to show their personal skills. He even mentioned this in an [interview](http://bangtanmonogatari.tumblr.com/post/132725462537/bts-my-biography-v):
&gt;I would like to try acting if I get a chance, but I half-assing things is not good, right? I want to properly study acting, and tackle it when I think I am ready.

There are a lot of factors we don't know about Hwarang; we don't know if Jin was ever involved in it, for one. We don't know if Taehyung auditioned for it or if he got the role offered. And I personally wouldn't bring their individual popularity into this either. For example, Infinite's Hoya wasn't (nor is) as popular as L, and yet landed a big role in R1997 in 2012. So if Jin gets a role offered, he will get it too, despite his lack of popularity. 

Thing is this: Taehyung got the role, and that we should support him for it. I understand the worries about his acting - acting out a YA drama MV trilogy is different from a historical drama - but despite that, I think we shouldn't bring Jin into this. I like this fandom for supporting every member (mostly), and I hope this doesn't change now. Mainly because now it's Taehyung's time to shine.",51,35
