I'm Canadian.  Canada has two official languages, English and French.  I am an English speaker, but learned French in school.  I grew up in a small, boring English-speaking city -- so boring that people from Quebec (the French speaking province) never wanted to move there to teach French.  So, when I was growing up, my French teachers hailed from places like my hometown, France, Scotland, Mauritius, and Switzerland--  but never Quebec.  Not once. I finished high school with vaguely Swiss accent. The French accents in European countries are **very** different from the Quebec accent.  Europeans sometimes view the Quebecois accent  as somewhat less than proper -- kind of like the way folks from Seoul view satoori.  

Quebcois people, though, are fiercely proud of their accent.  (And rightly so). So when I started working for the federal government, my Quebecois colleagues were a little hurt that I, a Canadian, sounded vaguely European. I totally understood this, and I'm happy that over the years, my accent has gradually changed. However, European French speakers tend to cringe.  They are used to anglophones speaking French with a European accent; an anglophone using a Quebec accent sounds weird to them.  In short, no matter which French accent I use, I know that someone is going to cringe or frown.  

&amp;#x200B;

I also speak some Spanish, though it's getting rusty.   I spent three months Colombia. Then I had a Mexican boyfriend for a year.  Then went to Spain for a few months. For those who know Spanish, you can imagine that a similar scenario occurred.  The folks in Spain cringed at my Latino accent;  so I learned to use ""vosotros"", added a ""th"" sound to some of my consonants, and picked up as many Spain words as I could. Then I returned to Canada, where most immigrants are Latino, soI tried to change back again.  I stopped using vosotros fairly easily, but my consonants are still all over the place.  Sometimes my z's sound like s and sometime they sound like th.  When I speak my rusty Spanish these days, no one can figure out which country's accent I'm trying to use -- least of all me!

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me (finally) to two sets of questions.  

Set one:   How much information do we have about where Namjoon learned English and from whom?  What about the other members?  We know that people from all over the world go to Korea to teach English.  Is it possible that one or two of their teachers were from the UK?  Is it true that Namjoon spent a bit of time in New Zealand?  We all know about the Friends episodes thing, but did he also have some American teachers?  

&amp;#x200B;

Set two:  I'd love to hear your personal stories about language learning, multi-lingual households, multi-dialectical households, code switching, accents, and anything else you'd like to share about language in your life.  I find all this fascinating.",136,58,False,self,,,,,

So next week I am going to see BTS in Paris for 2nd day concert in Stade de France. This would be my second time going to see BTS, my first time was last year in Amsterdam. For the Amsterdam concert, the europe fanbase messed up with fan project, so we did not have ARMY Time in the concert. With the current mess that is Young Forever in Wembley, I suddenly feel sad that for my second time I might not experience ARMY Time again. I do not personally know how long does it take for a new project to be approved, so I do not know what the France fanbase is planning right now. I know that some people think it is not something to be disappointed about, but I can not help but to think that my sadness is somewhat valid because I also want to go to concert to experience the fan-experience. I want to be in the concert not just because it is BTS, but also because of ARMYs. It is just different to fangirl in concert than to fangirl alone, and to have something big prepared together is just... different experience. So my question is, how was your fan-project experience? Do you think I will miss out a part of the experience without fan-project? If you have ever organized any fan-project, how was your experience with it? Was it difficult to get a project approved?",142,33,False,self,,,,,

I've loved each song cover of his (my personal favourite is his cover of 'I Love You' by Mate) so I can only imagine what a Kim Seokjin original will make me feel!

However, we don't even know the title of his original song nor do we have a snippet of what it may sound like so there is very little to go by as far as hints are concerned.

My own personal guess is that it will be a guitar based track that lends itself to a soft rock/alt-rock feel. It'll probably have a simple melody backed by his amazing vocals. I hope that he gets to show off his lower range, his falsettos, his beautiful vibrato, his heavenly angel-like harmonies, his ad-libs and high notes (obviously) via the song. I think it could also be very bittersweet in nature with the gut-wrenching emotionality of a Kim Seokjin ballad.

I have no idea what to expect as far as the lyrics/subject matter/theme is concerned: anything is possible. His existing songwriting credits vary quite a bit from each other so I feel we won't really know until we do. That being said I wonder if it will be something related to self-love and acceptance and how he sees the world around him and chooses to live in it?

Ultimately whatever KSJ1 sounds like I'm sure Jin will succeed in bringing out emotions in listeners that they never even knew they had. Needless to say we are all very, very proud of him. I hope he eventually does get the chance to talk about it and his process in a future Vlive.

I'm still not over it. I never will be. I can't believe it actually happened like ???????*they were right there in front of me.*Literally the most famous people in the world and my favourite people on the planet were stood right there in front of me and ???????? My brain still can't comprehend it. I got to see Kim Namjoon dance in real life (and what a masterpiece that was). Like seriously, God bless.

I've never seen anything so good in my entire life. Out of every single concert I've been to and every single performance I've ever seen live, BTS were the best, hands down. I think I'll have post concert depression for the rest of my life because I just want to do it all over again, I need to see it all for a second time.

We hopped off the tube and straight away were overlooking the crowd surrounding Wembley, literally just a sea full of thousands of people wearing merchandise with the boys' names on, and their faces were everywhere. It was crazy to me because even though Kpop is obviously huge, it's not something I ever see in my everyday life, I don't turn on the radio and hear it or flick through TV channels and see it - it's something that for me, exists solely online because I follow it and search for it - it's not something I get to see naturally in real life. However, looking out over Wembley and seeing BTS' faces on flags surrounding the stadium...I couldn't really believe my eyes.

There were South Korean flags, balloons spelling out 'BTS', merchandise, posters, banners - there was even a stand that had been set-up called 'Kim Namjoon for President"" (aka, my life motto). It was crazy. My friend and I were walking through this crowd of thousands of people and I just kept saying to her ""I can't believe this is real. I can't believe this is a real thing that's happening right now. This is crazy.""

And it was, it was so crazy and I couldn't get my head around it. I know BTS are famous - they're literally the most famous people in the world, but to see that fame right in front of you, to actually be*in*it...it was insane. They were everywhere, people of all ages, races, genders,*everybody*was there. Everything was BTS. I was in awe. We'd literally only just stepped off the tube and already we'd found ourselves in a crowd of people that were shouting ""J-HOPE"" at the top of their lungs. I kept looking up at these flags of their faces and smiling at how precious they were. I'd taken 100 photos before we even got to the stadium, I just couldn't believe it. It was the best thing ever.

There was a random dance play going on as well, a huge crowd of people just cheering and dancing and it was*so*fun. I wanted to try and say this in a more elegant way because I mean it so much, but I have never been in a situation where literally everyone is your best friend. We were all ARMY and we all loved each other so much - you could literally just stand next to any random person and instantly become best friends because you loved each other and you loved BTS. I literally loved every single person in that place. Everyone was beautiful, everyone was accepted, everyone was so full of love and happiness. There were *""love yourself""*and *""speak yourself""*banners plastered everywhere and it was even flashing on the screens that were giving out information to people around the stadium.

There were photo walls, merchandise booths, people handing out freebies - I was literally just walking and someone shoved a photo card into my hand and guess who I got?

None other than Mr Kim Taehyung which, what are the chances. Look how precious. Instantly my day was made (like, really? what are the chances. I'm so grateful).

We also quickly walked over to the Wembley SSE Arena which is right next to the stadium, because they had banners for GOT7, NCT 127 &amp; Monsta X who are performing there later this year (and they're my babies) - it was so crazy. I was literally in Kpop heaven. To see this all finally in real life I was like ????? what ?????? I've only ever seen it on my laptop screen before, but suddenly the names and faces of all of these people that I loved were being shown for the world to see. I was so proud.

The whole place was just so full of culture and love and acceptance and I've really never experienced anything like it before, the atmosphere was incredible. You really have to have been there in order to fully grasp what I mean but honestly, it was insane. I remember just feeling so proud and so happy for the guys because*look what they've done*, look how big they've made it, look at the changes they've made and the impact they're having on the world. I couldn't even take it all in myself.

I don't know how but we had club Wembley seats and so once we got inside club Wembley we were given the pink day one banners which said ""*When times are hard, look at the road we walked on together"".*We then made it to our seats and the atmosphere was*electric.*They had all of the BTS music videos playing on the screens and everyone was just screaming them, it was so amazing to see - like I said, I've never experienced any of this before other than over the internet so to finally be in a place full of so many people that were exactly the same as me, and to see it all happening in front of my eyes, was insane.

My favourite MVs that came on were Not Today and Fake Love because the crowd reactions were insane, it was*so*powerful - to to hear 60,000 people screaming ***""A day may come when we lose, but it is not today""*** was the most empowering thing I've ever heard, I literally just had goosebumps the entire time. Secondly, Fake Love was practically shaking the entire stadium because we were all doing the chant of ""Fake love"" and it was just, the best thing I've ever experienced to be honest.

The whole thing was just selfless. So selfless. If I could describe the whole night in one word it would be selfless, because it was about everything. It was about love and acceptance and I remember standing and watching that stage and thinking oh my god this must be the best experience of their lives, I'm so fucking happy for them. I was so, so happy for them and I kept imagining how great they must have felt and I was so, so happy because I wanted that for them more than anything. That's all I wanted. Their happiness is our happiness and if they're having the time of their lives then so are we. You don't get that anywhere else. I was watching them having the time of their lives and I stood there smiling like an idiot because I was so glad that they were, and I was thinking about how exciting and wonderful it must be for them and I was so grateful that they were getting to experience that because they deserve it more than anyone. They're the best people in the world and no one can tell me otherwise.

I literally spent most of the night stood there with my hands over my face because I was so in awe and I was so happy for them and I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it for them, I was just so mesmerised watching them take it all in and I thought oh my god you deserve this so much. It wasn't even about*me*getting to see them live, but just to be there and witness something great that was happening to them. That's what it was about for me - it wasn't about me - it was about getting to see them enjoy themselves and be so happy that this was happening to them and for them, and that was the same for everyone - we were all there for that same reason, and that's why if I could describe it I'd choose the word selfless. It wasn't about us, it was about them. We were doing this for them.

They deserve the world and more and I have never been in a place full of literally 60,000 people and felt so comfortable. Everyone loved everyone, everyone was each other's best friend, we were all there for the same reason and the same purpose and we came together to show these 7 people that they were changing the world one step at a time, and we were so grateful for that. They're paving the way for how the world is supposed to be - the world BTS are creating is the one we're supposed to live in - the one we all*want* to live in hence why there were 60,000 people in front of them completely and utterly, selflessly loving them. People wonder why these guys are so big, but they're paving the way and changing the world and I will follow them forever. We all will.

The space they have created is so incredible and beautiful and I am eternally grateful to be a part of it - I love you ARMY, so much. I love you. At the end Jimin just kept screaming*I love you ARMY*and I was thinking oh my God, we love you so much more, always.

I wasn't expecting it to happen but surprisingly, Hobi got me choked up a few times throughout the night. Near the end when they were giving their closing speeches he said*I love you* as his closing lineand I was tearing up, because he meant it. They all meant it, of course, but there was something about Hobi's tone that was just...I don't know. I can't describe it and you won't understand unless you were there but it really, really hit me. The next time he made me cry was just before they were about to leave the stage and he said ""*I'm here""*looking directly into the camera, and then he pointed at himself and said*""Hope's right here"".*And I just. I was a mess. I'm tearing up again just thinking about it now but he is such a beautiful soul and he's a beacon of light for all of us, he really is our hope and he meant it so much. He was looking out to 60,000 people and saying *hey, it's okay. I'm here. Don't worry. Hope's right here, and I always will be.*And I just. I love that man so, so much.

Speaking of men, let's speak about the best man on the entire planet, Mr Kim Namjoon. I know we all joke (but not really since we're all serious) about wanting him as President but I swear to God, every time he came onto that stage I felt like I was in the presence of a king. I'm not kidding. He's magic.

Hopefully some people are going to understand what I mean here but sometimes your bias chooses you and other times you choose your bias. Tae is my bias by default just because, and there's no getting away from that. But if I could choose my bias my God Kim Namjoon would be right there. He is the most beautiful man I've ever seen, inside and out, I felt like I was in the presence of a God.

Which brings me on to my next point and let me say this loud and clear, I have been to many concerts, seen many artists, watched many performances and seen many songs sang live, and Kim Namjoon performing Trivia Love to 60,000 people wipes the floor with all of them. I've never witnessed something so insanely spectacular in my life. It was absolutely unreal. Once he'd finished the song I wouldn't have cared if they'd scrapped the rest of the entire setlist and instead had him sing that another 10 times over for the rest of the night. I'd literally buy a ticket to see him perform that song on repeat for 3 hours straight and I'm not kidding. It was*insane.*He is so fucking clever I swear to God. I remember him saying that he created that song for the purpose of it being performed on tour and well he hit the nail on the head once again didn't he. I have never in my life witnessed something so brilliant, I literally cannot get over it. The feeling in that stadium...the atmosphere - the feeling it gave*me.*I'll never, ever forget it. He is incredible.

To hear the whole stadium singing the Korean lyrics just as loud as the English ones as well, was insane. I was so happy and so proud and I just thought to myself again,*guys, look what you've done. Look at the changes you're making.*They're literally single handedly taking over the world and I'm so, so here for it.

When they did their solo performances or whenever one of them was getting emotional, everyone would begin chanting their names in support. I realised I never get to say their names out loud and so to be shouting*Kim Seokjin*at the top of my lungs was just, yeah. It was great, basically. Near the end when they were giving their closing speeches, we began chanting their names as each of them began to speak and stomping our feet so loud it was shaking the whole stadium and I remember just seeing their faces in absolute amazement like*wow, this is really happening right now?*and all I could think was**I !! am !! so !! happy !! for !! you !!**

There's so many more things I could say that I know I will have forgotten but I'm still recovering and trying to get my head around the fact that they were right there in front of me and I've never loved anyone so much in my entire life. All I can say is thank you for everything and I'd literally follow these guys to the end of the earth. I will. I love you ARMY &amp; I love you Bangtan. I purpleyou forever. Thank you. You saved me.",35,155,False,self,,,,,

I have recently noticed that BigHit might be trying to change the way they do things / expand their services and things like that , most likely for renovation and to better handle the huge rise of BTS and their demand. They opened a sub-division for BigHit in Japan ( I think ) and they updated their websites and opened new ones , including the recent BigHit shop app . Not to mention the global screenings of the 2 BTS movies and the ARMYPEDIA event . Some people have also noticed and remarked that the merch for each country is different in quality or quantity as well . Do you think that the cause of that might be sub - divisions they might have for the merch according to countries , maybe a crew - design team of people of that country so that they are better able to grasp the preferences for each country ? Do you think something like that is going on? Or maybe they are just expanding and as such hiring more employees who are not yet as experienced . Because compared to the WINGS Tour , this tour has been very different and with different quality of merch as well as marketing . Also , the hashtag they used for the Weply app promo was not what I would expect from BigHit. 

What do you guys think? It's not that impossible , right ? I mean , they did appoint a co-CEO recently so that Bang PD would concentrate on the music part of the company so maybe it was getting too complicated for him to handle alone. I mean , the last 2 - 3 years they have shot up and the business part of the company must have gotten so so complicated and huge compared to way back then . They must have opened so many more divisions and hired so many more employees , especially to handle the legal and business matters for each country they do promo at and visit!!!

Anyways , I really want to hear your opinions , especially if you are knowledgeable of such matters!!!What do you guys think?Am I just saying nonsense ?",98,39,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

New ARMY here. I recently fell in love, and I guess I am in the ""Boy with Luv"" era right now. I remember streaming the music video so much, and feeling so happy listening to them, looking at them. I listened to ""LY: Tear"" last summer but ""Map of the Soul: Persona"" changed me. However, now that I think about them, my heart hurts. Like I feel this pain when listening to their songs, but I don't know why. I deleted their music off of my library, but I keep coming back to it. I don't want to marry them, and I don't expect to ever meet them (so this is not a fantasy thing). Going to a concert seems to pop up in my mind, but then I get sad thinking about the members crying at the end (listening to ""Mikrokosmos"" pains me so much). Youtube also messed up my algorithm as soon as I watched one BTS video, and now my recommendations are filled with them (doesn't help that I subbed to ""BangtanTV"" and ""ibighit"" LOL

&amp;#x200B;

**My concern:** What I am trying to say here is, what should I do about this? Their message is all about loving yourself, but I get depressed when I listen to them. I have been dealing with depression since high school, but since I left my college and am home for the summer, I can't talk to my therapist about this. Please help.",30,32,False,self,,,,,

I have been following the boys for a while and I have the utmost respect for them; for the work they do, for the message they are trying to deliver, for staying humble even with all the fame they are gathering globally and for challenging the music industry.
I forgot the last time I actually read the lyrics of a song and tried to find the meaning behind them so... Thanks guys.

Anyway, I really wanted to see them live and see if they are the real deal. So I asked my sister to come with me to the concert and she agreed (fyi, we are both in our 30s). She has no idea about K-pop, or BTS, their message... nothing! She does go to every music festival in Europe and she is def into music.

Not sure if I want her to just absorb the concert with as little info as possible - just the basics about them (I won't be disclosing some of the details, aka flying JK) ? Or If I should share more details with her so she can enjoy it even more. Thoughts?

I am soooo curious to see how she is going to react! Honestly, I am curious to see how I am going to react! I may be a full Army after this.

Thank you and if someone is going to the concert on Fri. See you soon ;)",54,64,False,self,,,,,

I am not a teenager but a grown woman , currently on maternity leave. I stumbled upon bts about 2 months ago and fell down the rabbit hole hard. I now listen only to bts while prior I listened to rock. I watch countless of YouTube videos - crack videos, shipping videos, mvs and bombs. I am feeling its becoming unhealthy. My husband noticed how much time I consume online with them
Of course I take care of the house and the kids but it's like they became my only interest. I dont watch TV shows almost that I used to like. I am a lot on insta. I watch streams of the tours at night (my time) when the baby keeps me awake.

I dont know what to do to tone it down.  I am a reasonable grown person and probably since my state is a bit sensitive and I spend a lot of time alone (I dont have other mom friends around me) I guess I got sucked in.

It never happened to me before with any band, and from what I see it Happen to many. Any practical advise? Will it tone down by itself? 

Thanks",172,207,False,self,,,,,

I think we are know recently we have had quite a few problems within the fandom that could have been easily solved if people communicated to each other properly rather then just depending on he said, she said, and jumping to conclusion  (something army does a lot ) and basically make a mess out of things that honestly weren't that big of a deal if we actually think about it in the grand scheme of things. 

So I was wondering if it's possible to have a forum/ bulletin board/ just a space of sorts for just army were the whole fandom can communicate. I know twitter is the place where most of our fandom communicates on but I think that using Twitter as the sole major method just leads to more problem rather the  solve the problem due to mis-communication. I know I - army have been thinking about fancafe for international fans so I would like to suggest that rather then a fancafe for just I - army, how about a fancafe or sort for all the army including the ones from korea, Japan, China, Asian, Europe, Australia, America,  basically the whole army world. We can have those tests that fancafe have to make the place something just for army were we can discuss freely yet not expect things to get out of those space ( twitter, reddit etc are all spaces that media tend to keep an eye so anytime we discuss any random controversy media gets to know about it pretty quick, make an article about it and make the problem even bigger then before so maybe having an army only place to discuss these problems could at least limit those media articles if nothing else).

I think army as a whole has grown to incredibly huge and diverse that the problem we are having will only keep on increasing. We are from all over the world, have our own culture and traditions, have our own experiences and way of life and all these shape our perspective and even though we love BTS (which is incredible in itself if you thing about how many people from how many numerous country love these boys despite not even knowing the language) we are still very much ourself and if even the UN can't keep the nations in harmony then how can a multi continental fandom keep proper harmony especially if we aren't even able to communicate properly sometimes due to language barriers, time, difference in experiences and culture etc. Difference within our cultures will always be there and maybe having a place where we can learn about it and learn to respect it would be better and I just find twitter to be really inefficient for it. (The other forums like reddit, amino etc are just too small to actually make any dent in the on - going mis-communication and it doesn't help that most of us also get the info from twitter anyway, reddit in general tends to be a bit behind in any controversy so by the time we do get involved or get to know about it the damage is usually done and feelings are hurt).

I know making a forum like this is kind of wishful thinking, I am not a CS major so I don't really know the logistics involved in making a Web space like this, but it doesn't hurt to day dream once in a while. I just think that the relationship we have, that we are united for the boys despite our diversity and despite our differences is something wonderful and worth treasuring and I don't want these mishaps in the fandom to ruin that relation whether it's between k-army and I - army,  between British army and French- army or basically any part of army with each other. I just think these problems shouldn't be enough to ruin our relationship.

So how do we make this forum? What are the rules do you think should be set up? Should we have a bulletin board for issues where the perspective of each side is communicated in possible multiple translations given how we are a multi - national fanbase? Would having mods be helpful or would it be too much power and responsibilities to be put on a single person?",18,26,False,self,,,,,

The thread is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/bx6ufa/dj\_reacts\_to\_bts\_mma\_performance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/bx6ufa/dj_reacts_to_bts_mma_performance/) and the video is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=2&amp;v=ldfS-pEBo1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=ldfS-pEBo1U)

I don't really know anything about this reactor but at the 33:00 minute mark he begins to make some comments that I thought were worth a good discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, he believes that ARMY has watched so much BTS Youtube, and other, content ... that we know BTS better than any other fandom has ever known their idols.

And this has created a love ... in us ... for BTS ... that is kind of unparalleled in history. 

We are not -- just cheering -- for an artist that we love but don't know very well. This is a more intimate and a more real love because it is based on a greater knowing ...

It's also a love that is being expressed by a huge number of very diverse people from all over the globe ...

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think that the DJ is right. This love is different. It's a qualitative difference and the global nature of the scale is also different than seen before.    

But the DJs reference points, are all about Western artists and their fans. And he doesn't discuss the ins and outs of how accurate our knowing might be. As RM has pointed out so clearly. There is an RM and there is a Kim Namjoon. There is the BTS that we know and the seven real people that make it.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I would love to hear your thoughts. When Beatlemania first happened, the cheering masses didn't really know very much about John, Paul, George and Ringo while we ARMYs have seen a great deal of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook.

&amp;#x200B;

So ... is the love different? ... is it more real and more genuine and, perhaps, more powerful? Or not? Or something else? And is this a first time thing for the world, history or, at least, the music industry? Has a phenomenon like this ever been seen before?",53,96,False,self,,,,,

I'm getting a gift for a friend's birthday, and we are both huge BTS fans. I am planning on getting her a necklace/ring with a word/quote related to BTS on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to get her something more thoughtful than just getting a ring/necklace that says ""BTS"" or ""Jungkook"" on it. She's one of the smartest people I know and the merch she owns for other fandoms she's a part of are typically more inside-jokes / creative adaptations from certain things that inspire her about that fandom. she loves things that are layered and have meaning to them, if that makes sense  :) What are you favorite short phrases from BTS that inspire you!? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's going to be engraved through a seller on etsy, and unfortunately i think i can only do english characters, and i think it has to be less than 15 characters?

&amp;#x200B;

Other things that would be nice to incorporate: 

she's a gemini, she likes tigers, fire, water, and constellations.

Their aesthetic and the cinematography is soooooo good. The symbolism with the angels especially at the end is so intriguing and I love how it was filmed in a museum. Also their hair??? I mean it always looks good but WOW great colors this round. Boy with Luv is good too and I can't wait for what the future has in store for our boys.

I brought my DVDs collection to work today to show my coworkers how cool and creative the packaging is compared to what we normally think of physical album. This specific coworker is my friend as well and she knows about my love for BTS but doesnt know much about them. So long story short, these are the few things that she said: They look like 12 years old girls and too feminine (looking at Tear album  version R), This is gay (4th Muster colorful Group Postcard), Is his son gay? (knowing Matthew McConaugheys 10 years old son introduced him to BTS). What happened next is me calling her ass out, debunking all her claims, saying how youre Asian and you know the struggle so its really disappointing that you play into this stereotype. Being a second generation Asian American, especially in the current climate of this country, can you just simply recognize and appreciate the social impact and achievements that BTS is having. I was pretty emotional so its a blur now what happened. We have this kind of banter when we discuss something controversial and Im sure she got my point but in no way I was loud and ""too"" aggressive.

&amp;#x200B;

For the rest of the day after this incident, I was having a whole existential crisis and thought about things I never did before, here are some I come into conclusion:

* Words matter, be kind, think before you speak. Don't trash other's hobby and interest. Its indeed sad to be on the receiving end. 
* I am grateful for BTS existence and the community that came from it. Theyre literally breaking barriers, British wall, paving the way, getting people out of their comfort zone, promoting their beautiful culture, changing people mind, heart and life. I am single rn but the warm fuzzy feelings they give me everyday, I can only guess having a bf could be somehow similar lol. 
* Stan Twitter has this saying ""I know K-Pop aint that serious but if you come for BTS, I'm gonna break your kneecap"" and other variations. I used to think K-Pop is just a hobby (I'm a 2nd gen fan since middle school and only listened to K-Pop again after I knew BTS which is 6 months ago) and who cares about the shit dumb people say. But my mindset is changed now. I consider the boys to be my friends (they're not but let me be haha) and I don't let people talk shit about someone I love and care for. And **silence is complacency**, which brings me to this point. Stand up for yourself, your hobby, your principle and the people you love. I believe everyone has a mission in life, no matter big or small, we all can make a difference in the world. Even if you're not Asian or POC, don't think it's not your place to call people out on their xenophobia, racism, homophobia, and educate them with respect. Even if it doesn't work, at least you speak yourself and do something about it.
* So in short, I've become a better person since stanning BTS. I learn to be kinder and more thoughtful, definitely braver (never thought I would argue with people on the Internet for BTS)  and most importantly be proud of who I am and stand up for what's right. **I am unapologetically me, I am LOUD about my love for them and the things I enjoy in life, and thats my personal take on loving oneself** (hence my title for this thread)

&amp;#x200B;

Please share with me if you have any similar encounter and how you dealt with it and did any change come out of it?Or just anything, I want to listen to your feelings. I love you BTS and ARMYs with all my heart and I'm happy to be alive to experience this journey with all of you.",111,349,False,self,,,,,

Few things to note: 

\- I ship out worldwide from Singapore, so shipping is approximately as expensive as from Korea out to EU/NA. I'm not including shipping in price, so consider the fact that you will have to add shipping. Price in USD.

\- Most are official goods from 2014-2017. If you want an album, I probably have one too. Stocked up multiple copies to contribute to sales back then.

\- I will ask for verification as I REALLY don't want anything to end up somewhere else marked up. ARMYs only. Please be comfortable sharing your other methods of contact/social media accounts or else I'm sorry, but I won't deal with you.

\- I have a Google spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GrUDbHhrN1ObEHT0bHfV8kPZ6qoV3cvGtkzckns3L0w/edit?usp=sharing). Some official goods will be added once I managed to dig them out of storage. (Think I have the Summer Package 2014 intact and a set of the [6cm Hiphop monster figurines](https://imgur.com/a/u7CWdIn) if someone want a full set.) The second sheet is a list of fansite goods (mostly Jin) which is not for sales and only for GIVEAWAY, as I'm not comfortable selling fansite/fanmade stuff. Whether you're buying anything or not, if you just want something, let me know. Cover the shipping and I will send out to you.",19,37,False,self,,,,,

That now makes me suspicious of any artist that has come to the Big Hit offices. For example, we know Honne came to Korea and that resulted in Seoul on the RM mixtape. Halsey came to Korea and we got Boy With Luv.

Know Im wondering if anything will come of Jorja Smith visiting?

In the previous game, *Just Dance 2019*, K-Pop songs such as Big Bang's ""Bang Bang Bang"" and Blackpink's ""Ddu-Du Ddu-Du"" were included. I was thinking that BTS might be on the tracklist for this year's game.

I was wondering if you guys think that BTS songs will be included in *Just Dance 2020* and if so which songs? What songs would you personally like to see and play in the game?

The developer of *Just Dance*, Ubisoft, will have its press conference about new games on Monday, June 10th at 1 PM PT.",8,60,False,self,,,,,

I've always been personally kind of iffy on backup dancers in general just because I'm easily distracted and I can tend to miss a lot of things when my eyes are wandering everywhere trying to take everything in. Not that I don't care about them or that they're not talented or anything, but they're really the... ""filler"" that some of these dances need.

But it's filler in a good way.

I was so hype when the boys performed Mic Drop on SNL but I was also a bit disappointed because those dance breaks felt really empty without the backup dancers. Not Today and IDOL would've probably felt the same way, like, those are songs where you NEED to have those backup dancers to really feel the excitement, you know?

I know this is a weird comparison LOL but I've always thought of backup dancers as being akin to things like... ensembles in musicals. Like, take Les Miserables for example. That show is legendary and it's been running on Broadway for decades for a reason. The score is extravagant and EPIC, and that's all because of the gigantic ensemble that you need for a show of that scale. ""At The End Of The Day""? ""One Day More""? ""Do You Hear The People Sing""? None of that would be as memorable without the chorus of people (also acting as voices of the citizens of France) in the background. And I feel that's the same thing here. The hype wouldn't be as strong without the backup dancers.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Ive watched enough content on YouTube that Ive inevitably run into videos like Jikook is real! and watched a few out of curiosity.  Ive also run into plenty of similar type comments on Twitter from fans promoting actual romantic relationships between the members. It seems this is a normal thing for Kpop groups now and my only other exposure to kpop was back in the 90s. I certainly dont remember anyone saying Did you see how Seo Taiji and Yang Hyun Suk looked at each other? But then again we also didnt have social media back then. 

Are people who promote shipping mostly non-Koreans who are unused to skinship culture among Korean men? Or has this become even more of a phenomenon because skinship culture in Korea has become even stronger in the last decade? Or is this happening because kpop industry is promoting it with the whole notion of fan service and then other fans take what they see on stage to a different level? I just find this whole phenomenon very interesting especially as a Korean being aware of how conservative Korean society is (or maybe used to be?) for this whole subculture to come out of it.",115,53,False,self,,,,,

* for ""Speak Yourself,"" they've eschewed the frillier Love Yourself tunics and harnesses/straps of Fake Love, 
* Jimin wears black and white during Serendipity instead of a rhinestone bib, 
* Jin left the flower-embroidered suit, 
* JK now wears denim instead of white and a tulle cape for Euphoria, etc....

As for TV and smaller venues, they now wear Western style suits, whether they be oversized, or fitted, for BWL and Dionysus. We haven't really been seeing the ornate and flashy outfits of DNA and Fake Love. They've also been wearing less eye makeup and highlighter.

A while back I had guessed they'd go with an Old Hollywood theme, and I thought that was smart, because it's a very accessible theme and look for Westerners and for countries that consume Western media. On that note, I have been wondering whether the more ornate, dramatic ""Kpop look"" has been set aside for an appearance that's more familiar to media consumers so their performances and music can be more of the focal point, and so that newer audiences don't immediately write off their work as ""manufactured/weird Kpop.""

I had also thought maybe at concerts the costuming had changed because it may simply be easier to change into (less complex pieces), but that wouldn't apply to the televised performances and videos.

If it is the case that BTS wants to be more ""visually accessible,"" my guess is also that they're doing so because they think they've reached a point where they can become truly mainstream and an established part of the Western music industry, and they want to facilitate this potential as much as possible, because widespread, long-term appreciation for their music is their goal.

I'd love to hear any observations or opinions on this and whether anyone else has noticed this change!",53,1,False,self,,,,,

He generally likes rap, especially songs with deep meanings and narrative story telling. His initial impression of k-pop that it is generally one-dimensional, but I said that BTS has a wide variety of music and genres with great lyrics so he said he would be willing to give it a go...By the way, he's a film student and half-Japanese (so not opposed to the language barrier I guess?)

Now I'm a girl and also my taste in music is different from his so I'm wondering what kind of songs I should introduce him to first.  I want to create a playlist of about 7-10 songs that show a wide variety/diversity and talent of BTS, but I'm not sure what is best.

I'm thinking definitely some songs from the rap line's mixtapes, as well as the rap unit. But of course I want him to appreciate BTS as the full seven members.

Do you guys have any suggestions?",6,5,False,self,,,,,

I think most of you might have seen this video (https://youtu.be/qbQk1sHol94) of Jungkook trying to reach out to a girl in wheelchair during concert. It was so sweet of him.

But it was so uncomfortable for me to watch. The way people swarmed him, the fact that he needed bodyguards to be around fans in a concert and the fact that we were all worried watching it, including Jin. AND it's not like three fans weren't hurt, like there were so many people being squeezed and pushed, omg so difficult for me to watch personally, I was getting anxious.

Watching it made me wish for a world where it isn't so difficult to meet a fan or reach out to the crowd.
 I so wish we were in a understanding where all of the ARMY would make space for him to go and interact freely with someone. How cool would that be? 

I don't understand the need to touch or be near your Idol. Just watching them from a close enough distance is amazing, why crowd around or touch? Sure a handshake would be special but idk, just watching them makes me happy. And if it gives them less uncomfort in so ready to just watch. 

Imagine how awesome they'd feel of we all made space for them everytime they are around? They'd actually come and interact with us more. 

I remember coming across the purple ribbon project and was so damn proud to read about it not only as a fellow fan but also as a human being who wishes for a better and understanding world everyday.

So what are your thoughts on this? I seriously feel if we give them enough space, they'll actually come closer to us, not go far away.",87,65,False,self,,,,,

I'm only asking since I only listen to the Korean versions as I find the Japanese versions always sound off lol. I'm assuming most of their b-tracks are in Korean and of course BTS will be singing their Japanese release only tracks like Crystal Snow perhaps?

With these recent SoundCloud releases, I've decided that I want to get (at least a few) of their SoundCloud tracks downloaded on my phone to be able to upload them to Spotify playlists.

There is a problem, though - I'm unable to download any of them because of SoundCloud's downloads limits. 

I'm curious if any of you have any of the original files and would be kind enough to share? ^^ (looking for original files because the quality is the best that there is out there)

The ones I'm mainly looking for are BTS FESTA 2017 &amp; 2018 releases, Promise by JIMIN, Scenery by V, some of JK's recent covers (WDTA, Paper Hearts etc.) though older releases are welcome as well if anyone has them!",18,58,False,self,,,,,

Ive also been guilty of sharing articles without reading it carefully bc it uses their name/pics and later someone else has to point out that the article was bad.

Now though; now I am more careful in sharing articles. I look at replies/comments before clicking on the articles/videos. If there are none, I guess Im the one taking one for the team and screenshot it. 

8/10 times I encounter articles that just say their name at least twice while talking about something else in the article body.

It was only after being active in the fandom do I even notice that a lot of writers/outlets recycle their works by changing words. How majority do not fact check or research before writing. Its like getting the article out is better than a well researched article that supports with facts.

As BTS gets more popular with the media outlets and reporters, I actively try to find articles that are well structured and supported with real facts before sharing. New ARMYs are joining everyday and they might mistakenly take bad articles as facts when its not. There are so many unofficial magazines and articles that claims to be the history of BTS and yet most is unsupported by facts.

I think it would be a nice fandom culture to foster active reading and deeper reading comprehension as well as active talks between fellow ARMYs to discuss journalistic integrity and honesty, one of the best thing about ARMY fandom is that almost everyone is an active questioner. Question everything and ask for supporting evidence. Doing research and encouraging each other.

First, the production scale and how i noticed that BTS look more energetic. I noticed that during singapore concert, they look tired so i assumed its must be because of award season. I am glad that this time, they took really nice gap between each concerts to recharge their energy for next concerts. I also like the fact that they held pop up stores to decrease congestion at the concert venues. I also found pop up stores actually sort of promotion for BTS as well to the public..... I mean imagine public walk around and saw fans long queueing and end up getting to know its for korean group, BTS! 

I do hope for next tour, they could consider for live band to give better audio for the audiences who attend. It make the concert sound more lively.

Very early on I adopted this philosophy that using popular media and common interests as the basis for assignments (even at the higher-educational level) is extremely useful not only for instruction but also building interpersonal relationships in the classroom.

I'm now 26 years old (not so young anymore) and I've taught in multiple countries and at multiple universities. The philosophy hasn't failed me, and this year it continues to provide, courtesy of BTS. I decided to try something new and so last year, I packed up my things and moved to Spain to teach *children (well, teenagers too, I suppose).* Not my forte but it's a learning experience. The problem was, not only were we separated by age, but also by culture. I really struggled to connect with all of the kids I was teaching when I first got here, and it never occurred to me that the one thing we would have in common was a band from Korea. It happened at the highschool first. We were watching a youtube rewind and IDOL came on in the background and these students *lost it*. I should've known then that I might try it with the younger kids (8-11), but it slipped my mind until recently. Yesterday, I spent the last day of school with the young ones and we're throwing an English Party and I can *not* for the life of me remember how we got on the topic of BTS, but these damn children who had spent all year avoiding me and my lessons were now rambling. I mean *really* rambling in English. 

""Profe, you like BTS? ""

I showed them my phone (lock screen: Jungkook drinking pop) and I thought I was going to be trampled to death. Even the other teachers were completely shocked by a) the kids flocking to me and b) their sudden excitement and attempt to speak English.

""Ah, profe, if you have any questions about BTS you can ask me. I'm Jungkook's wife."" 

""She can't pronounce SUGA, she says SUGARRRRRR.""

""Don't worry. One day, I marry them."" 

""Who's your favorite??? Which song do you like???""

Essentially, it's not a joke that music is transcendent in terms of communication. I've seen it happen before at the university level, but am now proud to say that I have also done it with people half my age. I'm sharing this here because I'm totally curious about the people who have had similar experiences as far as BTS being the bridge or the gap between some sort of communication/cultural/generational disparity. Whether it's a generational gap or an *I traveled halfway across the world and was sleeping in a run down hostel when I heard someone playing BTS in the shower. Now we're best friends* sort of deal, I want to hear the stories!",38,137,False,self,,,,,

Here are a few ways through which people experience BTS:

\- Music videos (this might be the most common for the general public) 

\- Music show recordings 

\- Live concerts 

etc.

Regarding my own history, I'd known about BTS for a few years and watched a few of their MVs. I remember thinking that the MVs had very slick aesthetics and good storytelling, but many Kpop groups have top-notch MVs so BTS' didn't stick out that much. It wasn't until my sis brought me to my first BTS concert that I became a fan. Their energy impressed me and after that I searched for more live performance videos to watch. I think if my sis had showed me those instead of the MVs I would have fallen down the rabbit hole earlier.

Using the example of one member, J-Hope in particular really left an impression on me. Still shots, music show recordings etc. can't fully capture his aura, dance and rap skills, and his looks. Music show recordings are fun to watch but they feel more stilted and confined to me. I don't fancy the constant cutting-away of shots (though I understand in theory the need to provide screentime for each member; it kind of ruins the full effect of someone's performance). They don't serve a performer like J-Hope who excels when there's no set choreography and space limitations. 

Also, most of the concept photos Bighit releases feel flat to me; maybe because they look too polished? J-Hope actually looks better in candid photos taken by people close to the stage at concerts. 

So yeah, nothing beats a concert for me. There's a rawness and immediate connection you can only get by being there in person. Fancams come closest, and I also enjoy watching their performances at award shows like MAMA &amp; MMA but sadly those don't happen often. I'm aware that attending a concert is a privilege and many fans don't get that opportunity which is a pity.",9,33,False,self,,,,,

Thought it would be fun to see everyone say a song or songs they wish had a Music Video and describe how the fantasy of it looks in their head.

I always wanted HOC (House Of Cards) to have an MV. In my head it has these dark aesthetics and like an Alice In Wonderland play cards kind of vibe. It would be so cool to see them like walking through dark garden paths and then something unique with cards I can't come up with lmao.

Since HOC is only the vocal line let's throw DDaeng in there to complete the total fantasy. Since the DDaeng fits already look like the Idol outfits. I'd love for the MV to have that type of theme. All crazy and fun while dragging.

Seven Saviors

I cried my heart out in the cold rain

I'd lost my sanity and been filled with pain.

He reached his hand out, making me gleam,

And told me not to be trapped in someone else's dream.

At the lowest point, where all dignity is lost,

He taught me that some things have no cost.

The happiness he gave me, the hope he gave me,

Are worth more than anything you see.

He taught me how important i am,

He taught me to love myself for who i am.

He became the friend I never had,

And from then, I was never sad.

BTS, thank you for what you've done,

What would we be if you hadn't come.

Millions of people I never knew,

Have now become my family because of you.",9,95,False,self,,,,,

Tell me all about what this is, when it started, what all we get to see during thing? Do they perform or is it just fan meet? How do they do fan meet with 25k ppl?

PS - I initially though there would be a mega thread for this, but couldn't find it.. or any such explanation or information on this, hence the post.

First, we are making a map of all of the charity projects that ARMY have done in BTS's name. You can see the current map, with projects broken down by year, from this tweet: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1134809406128963585](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1134809406128963585). Also, if you see a project missing, there is a form there to submit it so we can add it.

The other bigger event we are doing is organizing a worldwide ARMY Gift Swap as sort of a Festa for ARMY! It's an anonymous gift exchange between people in the same general area and we are encouraging people to take a gift and leave a gift. The things you leave can be small, like a note and a photocard, and of course, be safe when choosing where to leave it. Safety first, safety second, coolness third!! We just hope this is an exciting way to let ARMY connect and bring joy to people. 

The map of locations where gifts are located will be dropping soon. If you are interested in participating, you can submit the location of where you will be putting the gift through a form in the below tweet and we will keep the map updated as people join the project.

Tweet with info and forms: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1136256502669414400](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1136256502669414400)

I know buying from resellers is not a good thing to do, it is something I've never done before. However, I'm here in Korea, it's been a dream of mine to attend a Muster and I tried to buy tickets during the general sale, but I failed. As the dates approach, I feel like I shouldn't completely give up yet and I'm thinking of giving ticketbay a chance, but even if I'm not sold a fake ticket I'm worried I won't actually be let in in the venue.

Is Jimin a cat guy? I found a video of him with cats, does he have a cat of his own? I'd imagine traveling with a cat might be tough, depending on the cat but the idea of that would be so sweet. There is something about cat guys, I'm ALWAYS drawn to them.

Found the Jimmy Fallon interview, the performance was beyond and I fell apart when Jimin crumbled at meeting Jimmy, so sweet. It's funny, when I first got into Bangtan I was drawn to him and wasn't sure why, they were all really cute and talented, but now I see I had a feeling about him.

Are they all destined to go into the military, is there no way out of it? Does the band really end then?

Is there any talk about them creating a more English speaking album or song to get potentially more attention in America? I know they don't know much English but it seems they are trying to learn. Obviously they are doing so well without it but just curious as other non-English speaking musicians have made English speaking music.",26,10,False,self,,,,,

A few weeks ago, I started a thread asking what we, as ARMY, should do if any of the members started dating. I thought the ensuing discussion was really constructive and positive. 

That was a relatively easy question, though. In light of recent events involving other groups at a different entertainment company, I have a more difficult question. What should we, as ARMY, do if one of the BTS members is discovered by Dispatch (or similar) to have taken drugs, or proactively admits to taking them.  

I would like to limit the scope of this discussion to:

\- the acts of buying and consuming drugs, not selling them or giving them to others

\- drugs that are not typically prescribed to people (in other words drugs like crystal meth, marijuana, and LSD  not Adderall, or Ritalin, which are illegal in Korea, but routinely-prescribed medicines in other countries. )

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my opinion, as an international ARMY, but I am **very** open to hearing other views. 

I have heard that ordinary Koreans with drug problems get very little support or help for their problem. Not only are there very few resources and services available to them, but there is a huge stigma associated with admitting that you have a problem and asking for help. 

In light of this, I would love ARMYs message for the member to be:  We love you. We will wait patiently while you get help. We will welcome you with open arms when you come back. We will listen patiently and with love and appreciation whenever you talk publicly about your effort to stay away from drugs. We will use some of our fundraising power to donate to organization that help ordinary people fight drug addiction.  

Is this realistic? Am I dreaming in technicolour?",23,0,False,self,,,,,

It was a short period of time between it being delivered and me getting home from work...So, I dont really know what happened.

I reached out to the support email from the shops website and was told it would take 7 days to investigate. Its now been more than 2 weeks and Ive not gotten any other response since then.

I don't know if I am in the right place to ask this question but since it's somewhat bts related I'll ask it here.

I've recently pre-ordered the album ost on amazon with my credit card, this morning I checked to see how much money I had and about 28 euros were missing (it's more or less the price of this ost I preordered) . I've searched on Google and apparently you're not charged until the item is shipped. I'm worried that I won't get it since I don't have enough money on my account.

he stood out to me the most same with Hoseok. I thought Namjoon was kind of a try-hard during his edgy hiphop era, but after i got to know him and his personality, he just became a cute goof to me, so he became my bias.

I thought Jungkook was a stage name and his real name was Yoongi so i was really confused when i found out that was incorrect

I honestly didnt notice Yoongi so much, he was quiet but really attractive and came off as really cool and edgy, though i didnt pay much attention to him, but after i found out he was called Yoongi he became my 4th bias lol

I thought Jungkook and Taehyung were twins, i had a really hard time telling them apart and had to look at pics all the time to get used to their faces. I found them kind of annoying since i saw them everywhere? I often ignored them and focused on the others, but after a short while, i got over it and i now find them hilarious and very wholesome dudes.

Hoseok was the one who stood out to me the most when i first saw Dope, i found him weird, but i really liked it. I also thought he was annoying at times in bangtan bombs, but now i dont care, i love his personality. After seeing aload of selfies on twitter i instantly fell in love with him haah

To be honest i thought Jin was the youngest in the group so when i found out he was the oldest i was shocked. My first impression wasnt anything bad, hes my 3rd bias and always has been. But when he would tell his jokes i never understood them so i hated his jokes for awhile 

With Jimin i didnt really notice him much either, he was and still is incredibly cute and very flirtatious. I mostly noticed him for his voice which i really loved since its quite unique. When i first heard his voice i was surprised aswell as amazed.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Would be really nice to hear any stories you have of BTS too!

Ive been listening to their songs for the past year, but the love their fans have for them didnt hit me like a ton of fricking bricks until recently.

Just watch this one video, I said. Oh, just learn what this persons name is, I said. Little did I know I would be proper fangirling literally in a space of a few weeks...

As a fellow Asian who grew up in a very Caucasian environment, I never had people of a similar culture so widely accepted in the media that I could look up to. For me, BTS becoming a global phenomenon is such a huge deal and eurgh I just cant articulate how proud I am! Im really happy that kids nowadays get to have these amazing role models.

Well, to say these men are just genuinely amazing human beings is an understatement. I get they are just like us, but the talent, energy, crazy hard work,  kindness, and love for their fans and for each other is mesmerising to watch.

I hope all the members are having the time of their lives and they deserve all the successes they have (and hopefully more!).

I accepted Serendipity super fast. I didn't even understand why my body was resisting to listen to it when it was so good. I guess it was because it was completely different that I was expecting.
 
About DNA, it is very fun song to sing. Probably it was the first BTS song where the audience can enjoy singing without sounding meh.

But it was always my skip song. 
Now that I listening to it... it's very high quality. It's good. But I wonder why I had prejudice against it for so long.

By casual I mean I do not define myself as an ARMY, do not actively follow every step of what theyre doing/promotions etc. But look forward to new albums and new music and watch their music videos as soon as they are released. I am aware of the huge global success the boys have had in the last few years. I am aware of what theyve gotten up tho though, and often watch clips of some things on YouTube. But I just dont really have the time to keep up. Im probably an older fan at 24 (judging from the amount of young kids, and under 20 year olds I saw at the concert I feel a lot older than most fans lol). 

I was wondering where would be the go to place to find English subbed things theyve done. Whether its their DVDs, tv appearances, and other clips. There used to be one for bigbang called bigbang archives and it had literally everything bigbang had ever done or released on there.
I was wondering if there was something like that for BTS, since I would like to watch their DVDs without paying the price for them (I dont like collecting kpop stuff, personal). I am getting more and more into the group now and would like to catch up on some bits.

I'm a Canadian Army who ordered some Muster goods! I know they haven't shipped yet but I am REALLY excited.  I was wondering if anyone has a link to, or first hand access to, translations of the 6th Muster Voice Keychain.  I can't speak Korean, but I collect key chains, so you know I had to order one!   

I totally understand if they aren't out yet, but if you could even point me to a reliable translator who is planning on translating them eventually, I would SUPER appreciate it!

Hopefully the links to the pictures work. It's the one that comes in white with the boys on the back. I bought it before the show and threw it on over my shirt I was already wearing because I didn't want to carry it. Turns out I got the wrong size (and I really can't rock this look; I was just concerned with getting a (read: any) shirt). I might just be an idiot but I can't find the size on the tag, but seeing as I usually wear medium shirts and this one is huge on me plus the sizing I found on the Big Hit site I am almost certain this shirt is a large. I washed it the next day and it's been sitting in my room since. I'm asking $35 including shipping to the US since it's used. If you live outside the US we can talk about the price as shipping is a little pricier. Please pm me if you have questions.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I really loved how they all flowed so well together - one after another, from the rain transition at the end of everythinggoes to the start of forever rain. I remember reaching everythinggoes and it just gave me such a nostalgic/sad/yet comforting feelings. Its crazy how one song could make u feel all that and I didnt even know what he was saying yet his voice and the steady rhythm captivated me. That and forever rain had to be my favourites from the album since I think I could relate to them the most and I found them to be the most comforting to hear when I was on the bus or walking somewhere. 

Anyway I feel like Im rambling here but I kinda wish I could go back to that moment where I first heard those 2 songs/the entire playlist because they were amazing and whenever I hear the songs I reflect back on what my life was like during the release.  Just wanted to thank Joon again for creating this and hope hes in a better mindset now than when he was producing and writing this.

To elaborate:

**2018 MAMA INTRO VCR (JAPAN):**

This VCR had the words **'FAKE LOVE'** written boldly in all caps which made sense given that the song was about to performed and was the title track for LY: Tear. However roughly a minute later in the intro VCR, as the boys begin to take off the robes and masks, the sentence **'I can be your HERO**' appears on the screen with 'HERO' written in a much larger font than the rest very much in the way 'FAKE LOVE' was capitalised. Jin, the protagonist of HYYH, appears just before these words are shown. This is then followed by these words:

***""I didn't know what power is,*** 

***I didn't know what love is,***

***But you taught me how to use power,***

***But you taught me how to use love""***

In the second VCR we have another mention of 'hero' and 'power' in a similar style.

**2018 MAMA INTRO VCR (HONG KONG):**

***""You gave me power, you gave me love,***

***So now I'm a Hero, So now I'm a Boy with Love,***

***I'll show you the Map of My Soul, I'll show you the Dream""***

What is really interesting about these lines is that we saw the word 'Love' emblazoned in the 'Boy with Luv' MV which was the title track for the first album 'Persona' in their 'Map of the Soul' series. If we have accounted for keywords such as love, boy with love and map of the soul from the VCRs then it leads me to believe that power, hero and dream are of similar importance. I was half-convinced by other theories that these two verses could potentially be song lyrics too!

**If the focus of 'Boy with Luv' was Love then perhaps 'Hero' can be the next title track with a focus on 'power'.** Power can have many different interpretations wrt BTS. This emphasis on 'power' can be divided into 2 spheres:

1) **BANGTAN UNIVERSE**\- The BU/HYYH verse is rife with different examples of power. Jin is said to have time travelling powers. Jin is said to relive his days over and over while stuck in a time loop as he tries to save his friends. In the 'Save Me' webtoon Jin encounter that white puppy like creature (which many believe is remniscent of a gumiho) and is believed to be the same one that was with Taehyung in the Stigma short film. The BU marked material also suggests that Jin used his powers to alter timelines and have Jungkook instead save Yoongi from the fire and also replace himself with Taehyung's actions of jumping from that platform into the sea.

2) **REAL LIFE/REAL WORLD:** BTS commands a lot of power in the real world. They have the power to influence fashion and cosumer trends, a powerful fanbase that is ARMY, the members frequently feature in the top monthly power rankings. The products they endorse or mention or are seen with get sold out within minutes. BTS is also currently spearheading South Korea's latest 'soft power' boost. They have power/sway/a means to communicate with an incredibly largely active and diverse fanbase and BTS are a powerhouse themselves if their worlwide sales are anything to go by. They've dominated social media for a long time now and are killing the album sales records ina streaming era. Even their messages of 'Love Yourself, Speak Yourself' are incredibly powerful. Their contribution to the economy is nothing short of powerful too.

More direct examples include: Namjoon also wore a 'Human Control System' jacket at MAMA 2017, Bighit drew a big 'S' on Jin's shirt at the MGA to possibly hint at the power of money in the music industry. Jin and Jungkook wear shirts with the words 'lost' and 'Control' in the LY Tear photoshoot and even Jin's ear-piece that is featured in multiple places sugggests that he is receiving orders from someone more powerful than himself. These instances alone show that there are multiple power dynamics at play at any goven point. ~~Suga even has the 'power' to predict Bangtan's future.~~

For a song to be a title track it must have that presence, association, history and potential to fulfill the musical scope, choreography, the BTS message of that particular album in the series as well as satisfy both the casual listener who enjoys just the beat and the lyrics as well as the portion of the fandom invested in theories and seeing some advancement in the BU/HYYH verse. 

'Hero' as a potential title track could meet all this criteria and could raise some additional questions: Is Jin trying to be a hero to himself and to the others by altering the timeline? Is his plan successful enough to finally break the timeloop? Does his power of saving others come at the cost of being unable to save himself? And then if Jin saves the others by changing their fate who saves him? Does Jin need saving? At all? And if yes then from whom? Himself? Someone more powerful? Do the boys by coming together ultimately become heroes to save Jin?

The idea of 'heroes can save others but who indeed saves a hero? And from whom or what do we save such heroes from?' could go incredibly well with the overall theme of Shadow which many speculate will perhaps be a darker, concept.

Going by their LY spoilery 2017 MAMA VCR I think Bighit does a give us a few concrete hints that are scattered between random words and red herrings. And these hints always (mostly) become clearer in retrospect. I also remember how we came to know that 'Fake Love' was going to be the title track when it was erroneously spoiled. This made me think that Bighit learnt their lesson that no one else besides themselves can keep secrets so they adopted the 'why not give out the title from the start?' idea to avoid any potential leaks in the future.

What do you guys think? Are there any hints or things that you have noticed that may align/contradict this? What are the other possibilities that these or other keywords could mean or represent?",63,141,False,self,,,,,

I'd seen BTS mentioned before but had zero interest, and I figured they were just some k-pop group that girls were obsessing over. After my mom said she liked them, I decided to watch, and I immediately fell down the rabbit hole. Since then I've seen every music video, every interview, every YouTube compilation of them, gotten to episode 26 of Run, and am basically listening to my playlist of 80 of their songs all day. I can't believe that I never listened to them before, they're such an incredible group of talented people, and their connection with and love for their fans is so sweet and humble. I love them and their music so much and their live performances and dancing and everything are so good I don't even have words to describe it uuuggggh they're addicting. Anyway, to the point of this post, the other day I showed my mom a bunch of their music videos, and it's weird seeing the perspective of someone else who doesn't really know them, especially when that's where I was barely 2 months ago (she does love Blackpink so she's seen k-pop before).  I mainly showed her songs that had really good music videos with a lot of dancing, and started with Boy with Luv. She said some funny stuff while we watched specific videos that I thought I'd share:

While watching boy with luv: ""Blue hair guy is pretty nice looking""
""Pink hair gets the girls, he gets the most ass.""
For every other video, I referred to the guys as their hair colors in BWL for her lol.

She persisted with saying that they all look like girls, so next was BS&amp;T. (I was gonna do baepsae but yknow)
Scene where jungkook is on the swing: ""Oooh that's a sex swing, that's what that means""

In every video, she pointed out Tae as the good looking one, so we know her bias.

In the beginning of DNA when Tae sings really deep: ""You expect me to believe his voice is really that deep, coming out of that little pipsqueak?""
ooH mom you have no idea HiS rAnGe 

From the second Singularity started playing, she would not let up on it being a sex song. ""It did the bow wow wow beat. That's a sexy look.""
""Mom it's about a lake and like mental anguish""
""Well lake must mean sex in Korean cause that's a sex song""
She even called my dad in to listen to it, and he promptly agreed with her. I even read them the lyrics and nope they still said it was a sex song.

She actually loved War of Hormone, but when Yoongi said the line about testosterone rising she goes ""yours isn't bud.""

I also showed her Fire, Dope, Mic Drop, and the 2018 BBMA Fake Love performance, and she couldn't believe they weren't lipsyncing (no comment on jungkook's shirt lift tho??). All in all she really likes them, particularly the songs that have a really catchy techno/pop hook and good bass, and after seeing their older stuff (ie anything but BWL) she doesn't think they look like girls lol. Has anyone else received funny reactions to BTS from their friends/family?",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Its been a while since we did some housekeeping, so theres a bit of a mixed bag of topics to discuss with you this time. There are **no major changes** to the way the subreddit functions; this post is mostly to inform you about general clean-up and to remind about a few things newer subscribers may not be aware of.

#Rule updates

First and foremost, [the rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) has seen a thorough makeover. It has been reformatted and re-categorized for ease of use. You can now use the directory to jump to the section you want to check out more conveniently. Title formats are now in a neat table (which is something we saw /r/TXTbighit do and asked ourselves why didnt we ever think of that).

To alleviate rule bloat a bit, some things have been consolidated under similar headers (such as ""Personal conduct""). Some rules have been reworded for clarity (such as ""Drama""), but almost all changes are practical; the meaning and the way they are enforced remain the same. Despite the rules page getting hefty, we tried to make it easier to navigate.

**If you still feel like some wording makes the meaning of the rule unclear or the formatting is hard to navigate, please let us know!**

##Discussion, fanart and weekly thread guidelines

New sections have been added specifically for **discussion threads** (E.) and **fanart submissions** (F.) to address the most commonly seen issues with them. Things like the 1 week policy for fan works (announced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9n21kx/181010_subreddit_updates/)) and uncredited/reposted fanart are now *finally* explicitly in the rules.  

* **Note about fanart:** we are aware that a segment of our users are against all forms of fanart in the subreddit. Weve seen your modmails! But we also see how much engagement certain kinds of fanart get, showing us there *is* a segment that strongly wants the fanart here. We also know that some fanartists would like less restrictive rules, but in order to compromise between having no fanart at all and *all the fanart*, this is the best we could come up with.

Content that is redirected to the weekly thread used to be scattered in different sections of the rules. They have now been consolidated under header **G. Weekly /r/bangtan Room** to act as a quick checklist.

##New rules

New rules that have been added are:

&gt;A3. Piracy and leaks

&gt;[...]

&gt;Please do not post about or discuss, directly or indirectly, any leaks regarding BTS music, merchandise, performances, etc. before its official release date, as this only further spreads and brings attention to the leak.

and

&gt;D6. Giveaways

&gt;Please message the mods first before hosting a giveaway on the subreddit. We will only allow giveaways with no strings attached - meaning the participants are not required to do something for the personal gain of the person running the giveaway, such as follow a particular account.

Both had already been enforced in practice, but are now added into the rules explicitly. Personal gain includes things like asking for followers, subscribers, retweets etc.

##Other notable additions

* **FMVs** have never enjoyed much success on /r/bangtan. Most of the time they get removed for other rules (self-promotion, low effort) or sit at low vote total and very little engagement. For these reasons they have been added under content suitable for the weekly thread. Live view count videos similarly dont generate much distinct discussion and have been added under weekly thread content as well.

* A clarifying note about **Medium** has been added under D2. Opinion blogs.

* **Tech-support** type questions about a product or a service (such as questions regarding V app or other Naver services, Army Bomb questions, BigHit customer service, hardware questions and other issues barely related to BTS) are now explicitly under ""G2. Close-ended questions"".

* An archive of all previous rule discussion posts is now easier to see at the bottom of the page.


*****

#FAQ additions

**There's a whole [Army Bomb FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faqbts/armybomb) now!** Rejoice! It can be accessed [on the main FAQ directory](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faq).

The following questions were added in [the BTS FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faqbts):

* I want to buy a gift for my friend/significant other/family member/coworker/stranger who is a BTS fan but I know nothing about BTS. Are there any gift suggestions?
* I want to go to one of the Japanese concerts. How do I get tickets?
* I want to go to one of the Korean concerts. How do I get tickets?

The following question was added in [the subreddit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faqsub):

&gt;Can the mods make a megathread for X?

&gt;The moderators are merely volunteer BTS fans who do these types of things when they have time. We encourage all users to make their own megathreads or compilations when the need arises - as mods do not have a monopoly on this type of content! If you want to volunteer to make an [event compilation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/liveperformances), please contact us in advance of the event. Please make sure to continue to update any megathreads you might make up to several hours after the event!  

**If you have any suggestions for questions you frequently see asked on the subreddit that could be quickly answered in the FAQ, let us know in this thread or in modmail!**

*****

#Other topics &amp; reminders

##Bullet journals

Bullet journals have been allowed so far as a form of fanart, but they have received some criticism and requests to be removed. They are arguably a borderline kind of medium between fanart and casual content, so we want to ask your opinion about what to do with them. **Would you prefer bullet journals to continue to be posted as fanart, or would you prefer them to be directed into the weekly thread as casual content?**

##Brigading

It should be reminded that brigading is **against reddits [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)**. All of the following is strictly prohibited:

* Asking for votes on a post on /r/bangtan or any other subreddit (upvote boosting or downvote bombing). Note: doing this on another platform, e.g. organizing to mass vote on Twitter/Discord/etc is also [against the site-wide policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or) - do **not** campaign to boost up BTS-related reddit posts.
* Urging others to go vote or comment on another subreddit
* Urging others to spam another subreddit
* Linking to a post on another subreddit for the purpose of driving inorganic traffic to it.

Additionally, urging others to mass PM any individual or any subreddits modmail will be considered harassment.

##Reports

Remember to please **use the report function** to alert us of things that need our attention! We try to stay on top of everything that goes on the subreddit, but we rely on you to fill in the gaps with things we might miss. So please use that report function! Reports are **anonymous** and **don't lead to automatic actions**, it's merely a way to flag something for us to check out.

The messages presented in their LY album series were really meaningful and have changed the way I think about myself for the better.... 

However, Ive also noticed that Ive been struggling to find the need to interact with people. 

Ive always been super dependent on other peoples opinions, which hasnt gelled well with my tendency to share what I like. But since Ive become a fan of BTS, Ive been sharing less with people, and Ive become more comfortable with respecting my own opinion and basically being content with it. Basically what Im trying to say is that Ive had enough of the disparaging and condescending comments.

And so it was like that for a while, but this particular one stings: I have a very close friend from South Korea. Weve been friends for over 10 years now. But I recently found out that he actually doesnt like the fact that Im a BTS fan or me even watching Kdrama, and he finds it weird that I refer to him as Hyung, its gone to the point where he vocally expresses his frustration about it to a mutual friend. A part of me is chalking this to awkwardness...

Has anyone faced a similar situation?

To give you a better idea of what I mean, I think it would've been really interesting if they did a song in which the ""roles"" are reversed, as in the rappers sing and the singers rap (nothing too serious, of course, just a fun song like Boyz With Fun). I think it would've tied greatly with the whole Persona concept, since some consider that it was an album with songs others expected from them (Persona for the ""old"" fans [you know what I mean], Boy With Luv - very GP friendly etc.). And besides that, it would show one of their ""personas"".

Another thing I'd like to see is a V/Jimin/Suga sub-unit track. Please.

It would be interesting if for Shadow they'd go for a Fake Love demo-like sound. Not necessarily for the title track, but for one on the album. 

Lastly, since BTS is known for experimenting a lot, having tracks with influences from many music genres such as Latin Pop (Airplane pt. 2), rock (Dionysus), what others would you like to hear that they don't do a lot of/haven't done? I think RnB/Country would be VERY interesting...",12,7,False,self,,,,,

If you search up the English translations for the lyrics to all the songs and take a step back and think about each songs main message I think you guys will agree that:

Dream Glow - it's about listening that aching desire in your heart to follow your dreams, and you prosper and shine (glow) because of doing so

A Brand New Day - seems to be about hope, having faith in yourself that this grand vision that you have will come to fruition and one day it will finally be realized

All Night - admittedly the lyrics from Juice WRLD's part don't fit with this but they at least do for Namjooon and Yoongi's verses: it appears to be about putting in that dedication and hard work, staying up in your studio literally all night working.

So even individually each song has a really beautiful and profound meaning but when you put them together like this, **I think that it really highlights and encapsulates *WHO* BTS are and *why* we love them so much.** We love them for their positive messages and unrelenting dedication to their work. These songs from the BTS world soundtrack are literally all about these aspects of them that we've come to love them for!",13,81,False,self,,,,,

Dear



We are writing to you in regards to your recent order with VT Costmetics Box.



Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that we willnotbe able to fulfill your order orany orders from the United Statesdue to distribution rights issues.



Prior to launch, we have had numerous meetings with VT Cosmetics. In these meetings, we were assured that we could sell worldwide without any restriction. After the launch, however, we were told that was not the case.



Over the past few weeks, we have attempted to negotiate with VT Cosmetics and their other affiliates to allow us to deliver your orders but have not been granted permission to do so in respect to their US distributor's wishes.



Fever Guys accepts full responsibility for this mistake. We promise and assure you that we will be taking precautionary measures to prevent any and all miscommunications with VT Cosmetics in the future.



To make up for this mistake Fever Guyswould like to send you a small gift. In the meantime, we will be sending over a full refund on your order. Please let us know if you do not receive your refund by the end of June.



We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences that this has caused and we trust that you understand this matter. We thank you for your continued support as a member now and in the future.



Yours sincerely,
VT Cosmetics Box Team

there are discussions floating about on twitter around collabs with bts and whether theyre genuine or the artist is just looking to ride on the boys coattails. its specifically about all night and powers pleasant showing some peoples comments/opinions on his ig story (which im not sure i can/should link to?) things like the song being the first bts track theyve heard because theyre not usually into things like that, and are only listening to because of powers etc,. people have taken offence to these and are complaining that collabs bring clout chasers and that fans should not give them any attention/welcome them. 

i personally find these complaints ridiculous; bts are going to work with whoever they want to work with. theres a long process that goes into a collaboration with another artist, and if at any point the boys werent comfortable, im sure they wouldve nixed the project. it feels weird that fans want to make a judgement after the song has come out on whether that artist is worthy of collaborating with bts because a) its already happened, all we can do at this point is enjoy the song. or not! its up to you b) who are we as fans to say that? if there is no genuine unpleasantness of any kind, i dont feel like fans are in a position to make that judgement. i find the sense of entitlement around the boys and the decisions they make/people they choose to work with very weird - artists dont need to be falling at the fandoms feet to be accepted. 

i just wanted to know the thoughts of fans on reddit, since things seem to be more measured here. apologies if i havent made myself clear, im struggling to properly put my thoughts on this into words. i also tend to ramble!",59,54,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

source podcast:   [https://twitter.com/rokmc913j/status/1142103749940273152](https://twitter.com/rokmc913j/status/1142103749940273152) 

&amp;#x200B;

The guy is an event organizer for the government.  

He talks about how usually celebrities do not want to be associated with politics since even being lightly associated with any party may turn the followers of the other party against you.  Not to mention, the the government usually doesn't pay well for these events.  

But still, a lot of celebs do try to help out when they can and he's thankful.  (of note, this is not to promote a politician, but to participate in events like Memorial day events, or events like the Friendship concert in Paris last October with BTS performance that President Moon attended).

Starting around 1: 50 from the first clip:

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm very thankful but truthfully, we can't pay them the appropriate payment.  The payment to a celebrity comes down to negotiation between the two parties and there is no set standard amount.  So the agency trying to get paid as much as they can is a natural thing.. but when negotiating with the government, that's not always possible. So they often have to have big sacrifices to their profits.  
&gt;  
&gt;A lot of people forget that if a celebrity agrees to follow the president to an event in Europe, in addition to not being paid the regular pay for the event, they often have to clear about four days of other schedules.  In addition to being tired, not doing the event is often beneficial to them, but they're not like that (meaning they still often help).  
&gt;  
&gt;BTS was one of the most thankful cases. We tried to say the same thing to them.  ""We'll try to at least pay for your transportation and expenses.""  They came during the president's visit to Paris.  They had one day free between performances in UK and Germany. Just one day.  They were supposed to rest that one day but it overlapped with the president's visit to Paris.    
&gt;  
&gt;To negotiate for this day, I went personally to New York and had a meeting.. and they said they'll...and I got the day from them.   So then I told them this, ""I'll at least pay for the transportation.""  And they snickered.  I was there to negotiate as the representative for the government and I was prepared to pay for business class for the members.  I knew I had to do at least that.   
&gt;  
&gt;""We use private jets.  Are you sure?""  they asked. So I worked out the numbers.  And including some of the staff, just the transportation would have cost about $100-200 K. Which was similar to the total budget we had for everything.   
&gt;  
&gt;So I said, ""Next time, I'll get you the president watches with gratefulness filling my heart.""  But thankfully, they let me trade the expenses for the watches.   So it worked out.  Again,  thank you BTS.",7,25,False,self,,,,,

I recently went to my first BTS concert and it got me wondering if ARMYs in certain parts of a stadium act differently. Everyone is different and acts differently at concerts, but, to anyone who has gone to several BTS concerts, have you noticed a marked difference in how fans act in different sections? Back sections vs. front sections?

I ask because I brought my sisters who are just becoming ARMY to the concert in New Jersey and their impression of the concert was really lowered because of some extremely, shall we say...excited fans. No shade on fans who like to shout how much they love the boys, it can just be distracting. We were sitting pretty far back, so I wondered if that makes fans go more crazy or if it's all the same no matter where? Can anyone share their experiences of other fans in different sections of the stadium? Is it all the same no matter where you are?

As a side question, what was a really great concert experience with some ARMY you didn't know?",31,14,False,self,,,,,

Hello! My name is Mako, and Im a literate/semi-literate/advanced literate roleplayer. I am 21 years old and in the Eastern Time Zone. Im currently looking for MxM romance roleplays. I am looking for HTTYD-based rps or BTS ones. I will be playing a transguy OC.



When it comes to roleplay:
 I can do all types of literacy. One-liners are a strict no, novella is possible but rare due to the longer response times and effort it takes to write them. 
 My character will always be a submissive or switch. 
 Short and long term roleplays are accepted.
 Mature themes are accepted, smut is required.
 Im very versatile, I will allow almost anything in roleplay, just ask. 



What's required to be a rp partner?:
- At least semi-literate to literate.
- Willing to collaborate on plots/ideas. 
- Do not spam me if I stop doing rapid replies. 
- You must be okay with roleplaying a switch or a dominant character. 
- Youre okay with me playing a transguy. 



- For HTTYD, you could roleplay Hiccup or an OC. We would do a rp in the HTTYD universe, the canon characters can be in it or not. You must have watched the first two movies at least.

- For BTS, you can choose to roleplay as any of the BTS members. It would be an OCxCanon rp with no doubling.

This is for fun of course as some of the boys will surely need a lot of training to consider acting but for example I think Jimin who might be their least natural actor right now still slayed his role of fairy doctor in the Muster VCR. So going by their personalities and antics there must be some iconic roles that would suit all of them! 

Personally, I was watching WAB PT2 from muster again and I saw them all acting out at the beginning getting shot and [noticed Seokjin!](https://twitter.com/FlyingAngel_JM/status/1142798429082439681) He acted out the getting shot part the best, totally natural!! So now suddenly I am thinking an action movie but maybe nothing too demanding action wise so something like Train to Busan. Parent to a little kid check, looking for ways to get out and running from zombies (RUN BTS) check, a bit of action check. I also think he would slay those OTT crazy king type roles (muster vcr) like [Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zhBLF1Fu0)?

Hobi, I am thinking [Monkey King (Sun wukong) from The Forbidden Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL6DZr1-MC8). His sunny, extra antics would be natural plus his dancing skills may help him with the action parts!

I love Jimin but I swear him speaking English almost seems like he's an American making fun of a Korean speaking english but it's so cute. I'm fascinated by the idea that Yoongi seems to know a LOT more than he let's on and I'm so curious as to why, maybe he's just too shy to do the talking and they all know it so let it go. 

I've also heard that it's a lot harder to learn a new language the older you get and maybe that's why the older members who don't know it are the ones that seem to struggle the most, from what I gathered, maybe I have that wrong. I think the 2 I've seen say very little english in interviews is Hoseok and Jin.

I'm very proud of them all though for how much they have learned, I can't imagine trying to learn Korean.

ps. As a 2 week long fan at this point I actually can tell them all apart by now and I honestly didn't think I would be able to. The hardest was telling apart V and Jungkook but now I can't imagine mixing them up, weird how that happens.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Here are some of the points that I've gathered on what the general consensus is as of now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those that think they will release the album before August 30 think this because: 

1. It's the Grammy's, duh. BTS has worked extremely hard and it isn't unknown that their next big goal is to win a Grammy and/or perform at the Grammy's 

&amp;#x200B;

Those that think they will release the album around October/November think this because: 

1. This gives them more time to prepare and perfect the album
2. August seems a bit too rushed seeing that they just released Persona in April
3. They need a proper break, and not rushing for the Grammy Cutoff will give them that
4. Taylor Swift is releasing her album on August 23rd, and say what you want about her, the numbers she pulls in are insane. If BTS release in the same week as her, getting that number 1 spot may not be a possibility
5. This will give them more time to really hype up the album and get more people to anticipate it
6. We don't know how far along in the album making process they are, so if they aren't at least halfway done, they probably won't be ready to release in August anyway
7. Releasing Shadow in October would still make the album eligible for the next Grammy awards 

&amp;#x200B;

At first I was sold on the idea of Shadow being released in August, but honestly now I think I would prefer it to be released in October. But who knows, maybe they finished the album a long time ago and releasing in August won't be a problem at all. After all, they did release LY Answer 3 months after Tear and even though it was a repackage, they still added a bunch of new songs.",194,70,False,self,,,,,

I think I finally caught up after a year. Then it hit me. What am I going to do when they have to do the military service? Will they tape extra episodes? I will watch everything unedited. Give me every sec.

Someone said 20M people who hate snakeu will keep things going. \*feeling a lump in the throat\* So they don't have to worry about momentum or anything IF they are going together.

Then I realized what about them? I hope they will be happy to learn and grow while spending time out of the limelight. Be themselves. Hopefully they will get to feel our love by watching their own content and fans' videos -- all kinds of meme, clips, BV, Run! and so on.

As BTS World has now launched, we will be redirecting some submissions relating to the game to its designated subreddits, **/r/BTSW** and **/r/BTSWorld**. They have also been added on [our list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/subreddits).

#What stays on /r/bangtan 

New content that's more directly related to or originating from BTS, such as

* New original music, such as the already released collab tracks
* Promotion coming directly from BTS, such as a video messages from them, etc. ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/c5qnjd/190626_bts_world_download_now_video_message_by/))

will be allowed as normal.

Additionally, discussion threads that put the game in a larger context or use it as basis for a tangential discussion ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/c5otcm/psychological_effects_of_this_game/)) that will be interesting for non-players as well will be allowed.

#What is more suitable for BTS World subreddits

All gameplay-related content and news about the game will be redirected to the BTS World subreddits. This includes things like

* Game assets (videos and pictures from the game)
* News about updates to the game
* Friend requests
* Questions about the game
* Discussion about the story and gameplay
* Other generic discussion about the game.

#BTS World flair

We have added a BTS World flair for the remaining content. However, we're still in the process of feeling out the frequency and type of content that will be out now that the game is launched, so there may be changes in the future. In the meantime, if you wish to **not** see any BTS World related submissions in your feed, you can filter the BTS World flair out:

* On desktop using [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) - settings console -&gt; Subreddits -&gt; filteReddit -&gt; Flair -&gt; Add filter `BTS World` 
* On mobile using most competent 3rd party apps. You can take a look at our recommendations [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/mobileapp).

#Hiding submissions

You can also hide posts you don't want to see by:

* using the ""hide"" function underneath posts, or
* enabling ""don't show me submissions after I've upvoted/downvoted them"" in reddit [preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/).

**Please don't use the report function for this purpose.**",27,89,False,self,,,,,

I've put a list of the specific triggers in the blocked-out section below. I'm not going to post the specific scene screenshots.

And just to anyone who feels they need to stop playing the game due to this: please don't feel bad or upset about it! It's okay to prioritize your heath and well-being over *any* BTS content. It doesn't make you any less of a fan.

[Specific triggers:](/spoiler ""General low-confidence weight/body issues, calorie counting, a member collapsing due to a starvation diet and the member defending their eating habits. All of this is presented in the same light hearted fashion as the rest of the game."")

----

Also, this has mentioned before but I would just like to add that the current English version of the game *only* uses she/her pronouns to refer to the player character with currently no way to change this. The Korean version uses gender neutral ones and I am unsure about other translations of the game.

----

And, to anyone who plans to comment on this post, I ***beg*** of you to please use the spoiler markup below if you mention any of the triggering content.

Hey guys! Im making this post to gauge who would be interested in purchasing the a Uniqlo Cooky or Tata shirt. These are the minimalist ones. I would be selling them at face value.

I ordered these online the night of the release and was too excited to realize that these were men sizes. I went into the store that afternoon and bought the shirts I wanted in my size. My online order just shipped yesterday and I was planning on returning them at Uniqlo. Before I do though, I wanna see if any ARMY who didnt get a chance to get one would like to buy them. 

**Cooky, size S:** Ill be selling this one for sure

**Tata: Ill either be selling an XS or S.** Im not sure yet if I want it fitted or baggy (will try it on when I get it and sell the other)  

I bought them for $14.90 Canadian dollars + tax (=$16.83) so **Im selling them for $17, plus shipping (**$17 dollars is $13 U.S dollars)**.** As of now I only plan to ship within North America (Canada and USA) but we'll see.

Let's get a mini book club/discussion going! (Some mild ""spoilers"" below, which are really just great quotes from the book.)

\_\_\_

I personally loved it. It felt like Youngdae was one of the few music critics that gave a serious consideration of their discography. For example, here was a short review of ""Blood, Sweat and Tears"":

&gt;One of the most distinct musical transformations since debut, this track represents the crossover from the formula of hip-hop idol to become a pop group. It was highly influenced by multiple genres popularized in the mid-2010s, such as dancehall (a genre of Jamaican pop music) and its subgenres reggaeton and moombahton. Unlike the party atmosphere of the original genres, this song joined symbolic lyrics with Baroque-style mysticism to create something entirely different from the genre's customs.   

There were also a ton of great quotes and interviews with journalists, musicians and even a literary scholar (please note, these are pulled from an English translation of the book, which was originally published in Korean. Nevertheless, they still resonated with me):

On BTS' versatility:

&gt;...BTS has three fantastic rappers and four excellent vocalists with different timbres, which allow them to span a wide range of the musical spectrum. Such versatility provides them with the freedom to experiment with different era and genres within one album constantly. 

Popera Tenor Hyung Joo-Lim's analysis of the BTS' vocalists:

&gt;I noticed from Jimin's vocals his clear diction, high-pitch skills that extend straightforwardly, and excellent falsetto techniques in R&amp;B sensibilities...Jungkook's voice shows incredible restraint. I highly appreciate his vocal techniques, especially when he connects the elegantly beautiful voice with a smooth head voice in legato. As for V, the timbre of his baritone voice is very attractive..He is also talented at expressing sweet and soft tones, very good at imbuing the music with his deep emotions...I'd like to describe Jin's voice as ""silvery"". Almost like a ""murmur"", his voice may not be the fanciest or the grandest...but he has stable breathing, along with the ability to interchange freely between moist (?) falsetto, modal and head voice with natural vibrations.        

About ""ARMY"":

&gt;Here, we must pay attention to BTS' ARMY for defining a new notion of fandom as the product of powerful unity and comradeship. ARMYs are not passive fans who simply go to concerts and buy CDs. They generate critical discourses within the fandom, analyze music and lyrics as much as critics if not more, and strive to exonerate BTS from misconceptions about them. The international ARMY has already achieved beyond what any PR department of K-pop agencies is capable of.",26,83,False,self,,,,,

See, Seokjin has everything needed for him to be an actor, from his look to his education in Konkuk. So, why hasnt he debuted as actor yet?

Backstory (sort of): I have 2 older sisters, one of them, the oldest, got into BTS in about 2017. She showed me, my sister, and my mom their songs in about 2018. I thought they were decent and my sister began liking them. Of course, my mom however, strongly disliked them, and she teased us for it. I started really getting into their songs when Map Of The Soul: Persona, came out. Okay, backstory over.

Once, I was talking to my sisters about BTS and she quietly says on the phone, ""BTS is turning my son gay."" Thinking nothing of it, I began trying to tell them apart with my sister after I got really into their songs. My mom eventually noticed that I spent time trying to get their names and faces right, and this made her angry. She began asking, ""Why do you care so much?!"" And ""Why do you even care?"" This is around when she started asking if I was gay.

One time, she heard me compliment (my bias) RM's lavender hair. This pushed her over the edge. She said, ""Guys aren't supposed say that about other guys. Why dont you like girls' hair?"" I told her that even though back in her day gender roles were okay It's alright to compliment somebody of the same gender. 

When she hears this, she the says, ""are you-"" and stops herself mid-sentence. Knowing she was going to ask if I was gay, I sternly answer ""No mom, I'm not."" 

Today she asked again and I dont know how to stop her from thinking this. Should I stop listening to them?

Surprisingly, many users in our community believe that mono shouldn't be submitted to the Grammys. There was massive swing towards ""it's not going to win, so why try?"" type of sentiment. 

**I'm curious to know your reasoning on whether it should or should not be considered.** 

I, for one, think mono deserves a Grammy submission. 

Here are some objections I have seen and my personal argument for those. 

(I will not be explaining the musical process or impact that mono has had because it has been repeated on this sub countless times)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**mono is neither Rap, HipHop or Alternative music - hence it makes it harder to submit under any of these.** 

Ddaeng. Wrong. 

Remember when Kanye West disrupted Grammy submission categories when he  he submitted his and Kid Cudis Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2) track from their *Kids See Ghost* collaboration album to the [2019 Grammys](https://uproxx.com/hiphop/grammys-2019-hip-hop-biggest-year-yet/) in two Rock categories? 

A submission /nomination under any of the genres mono includes is a possibility. 

(But I'll agree that there are countless thriving rap subgenres like Alt Rap that deserve more light than the five nominations for Best Rap Album or Best Alt Album.)

**mono is not even in the Top 100 Rap Albums** 

I cannot even begin to understand this comment, but let me try to explain. 

There are **123 albums** released by registered HipHop artists in 2019. ( as at 28th June | Source: [HERE](https://hiphopdx.com/release-dates#?month=1) and  [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_in_hip_hop_music) )

If you are telling me mono is worse than Lil Pumps's *Harverd Dropout* or DJ Khaled's *Father of Ashard* or any one of the other purely nonsensical rap albums that have been infiltrating the God given world of rap music, you can stop reading right here.  It hurts me, but I will even put mono above Logic's *Confessions of a Dangerous Mind*. (But, that's a different debate)

**mono has done nothing for the culture**

We are talking about a Grammy submission. Clearly not seeking a BET Award. That would be wrong. 

mono is an album that continues to heal millions around the world. If that doesn't count as doing ""something"" for the community, I do not know what is. 

The rap culture at present has taken a turn for the worst. In a world where skewy beats, cups of lean and mumbling are deemed as good music, how refreshing is mono to the naked ear? 

Make some great young rap artists like Chance, J Cole, or Tyler the Creator listen to mono and you'll see what I mean. 

**mono is not OT7, hence fandom problems etc.**

If some fans cannot support a solo project by a member who has significantly uplifted and assisted the other members to reach their truest potential, they should reevaluate their position within the fandom. 

An OT7 project would be the dream, I agree, but we already have  a masterpiece just sitting there. Why not? 

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly believe if Joon is happy and comfortable with submitting his work, it should be done.

mono is deserving of at least a few snobs at the Grammys lending their ears to listen a Korean Alt/Rap album.  

Again, I'm talking about a submission, not a win.

I actually started crying, out of nowhere, because of the song, the lyrics and how Yoongi delivers the lines. And I really dont know why. 
I started playing the piano when I was 10 and I struggled throughout. I havent been playing a lot recently because the piano is at my parents house and Ive been really busy with studying, and I feel like Ive somehow lost a connection to music. Maybe that is why, I dont know. No matter how often I hear First Love, if I concentrate on it I always tear up, even while writing this. Discovering BTS a couple weeks ago really made me want to reconnect, to play more music, sing and dance. I just dont know how to start again, except for singing along in my car and in the shower, or playing at the library (Im really rusty though).
Other songs that took over my heart are Mikrokosmos and Born Singer. 

So I guess I would like to know which specific BTS song really touched you and why?

My examples:


RMs best performance was on Ddaeng. That low voice sounds super cool, and his flow is really catchy. 


Jins best performance is probably on Dimple. That song fits his voice really well, and he sounds really strong.


Sugas best performance is August D, where he really shows off his impressive skill. 


J-Hopes best performance has to be his part on You Never Walk Alone. He sings beautifully, then launches into a really insane rap part that comes out of nowhere.


Jimins best performance would have to be Spring Day. Every line he sings on there is angelic, and the way he sings the last chorus is the highlight of the entire song. 


Vs best performance has gotta be that new one from the BTS world soundtrack with Zara Larsson. That style fits his voice perfectly.


Jungkooks best performance is probably on Boy With Luv. It sounds like the song was written for his voice, and the way that he says you got me high so fast is very addicting

|Estimated revenue per show|$3,187,703.45|$6,578,361.50|

\*Revenue information was not available for some shows. These shows are not listed in the first table to maintain accuracy

\*\*Calculated by multiplying the number of uncounted attendees by the average ticket price and adding it to the total revenue from the first table

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to an estimated \*\*$212,823,883.06\*\* of revenue from TWO TOURS. Of course a decent chunk of that goes to renting the venues, paying their staff, building/transporting the stage/set, transportation, hotels, etc but that's still a ludicrous amount of money, especially given the relatively low number of shows (for comparison, Shawn Mendes' Illuminate World Tour had 60 shows and made \~38 million vs the 42 Love Yourself shows making an estimated 134 million).
