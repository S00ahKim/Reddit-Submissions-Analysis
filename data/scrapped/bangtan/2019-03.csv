But now that the seating charts are out for a few of the venues - [updated Ticketmaster blog](https://blog.ticketmaster.com/bts-2019-tour-ticket-sale-prep/) - Im feeling a little more hopeful about having a better experience than I did in the pit at Citifield (again, if Im fortunate to get a ticket).  

Id love to know what other ARMYs feel about this setup. Also from anyone whos been to a stadium show with field seating, how did you feel about having seats versus a GA pit?  


Good luck to everyone trying to get tickets tomorrow! :)",85,89

Some tips:

* Check back to the official reseller sites; they often add more tickets at a later time
* Prices fluctuate according to demand and typically fall on the day of the concert
* If you're selling, watermark your ticket (put your name/username/something all over it) before posting a picture of it on any social media. Otherwise it will be used to scam others
* Instead of paying hundreds/thousands for a scalped ticket and risk getting scammed, wait patiently and check local Facebook groups, Twitter accounts, this thread, etc. There are always fans who can't go or have extra tickets, and you'll have more chance getting one for a more reasonable price.

Ticketmaster really needs to get their act together. There are so many other websites reselling tickets, so Ticketmaster did not do a good job of blocking bots

Since my Mom managed to get tickets to BTS for her and I, I really want to show her what the boys are capable of, and also their personalities!

She knows them a bit because of how much they mean to me, and while she believes they're really talented, she isn't nearly as into them as I am, and she doesn't find them attractive at all, probably due to the age difference, and she also mentioned they just look more feminine to her. 

We went to see Burn the Stage together and she had a hard time with the subtitles. She has cataracts so that may be a factor. 

I'm curious as to what you think I should show her, for both songs, music videos and videos that showcase their personalities. I just really want to show her how and why these 7 boys are so impactful to me, and ARMY all over the world. 

Again, she struggles with reading subtitles so I may show her lyric videos first, and then music videos. I'm not sure if I should just show her the songs that'll be at the concert or a mix from all their albums. 

How did you guys convert your parents? Any help would be very much appreciated! Thank you guys!

The clues we have so far are strong hints that they are going back to their early 90s hip hop sound.

In at least one of those Grammy interviews Namjoon hinted at sub units.

And personally, I think a lot of those hinted at Western collaborations will finally come to fruition.

This is what Im thinking. 

15 Tracks

Intro

4 OT7 BTS tracks

3 OT7 &amp; Western Producers / DJs (Pharrell, Zedd, DJ Snake, etc)

Interlude 


Vocal Line &amp; Western Singer(s) (Little Mix, Selena Gomez, Halsey, Camila Cabello, etc...)

Rap Line &amp; Western Rappers (Maybe 6lack, Wale, Rich Brian or someone bigger!)

Sub Unit 1 &amp; Western Artist 
Sub Unit 2 &amp; Western Artist 
Sub Unit 3 &amp; Western Artist

2. Jimin always managing to find a way to fall in public

Eventually I got them as lunch time ended and so I continued on with my school day very happy (No I didn't get floor tickets, yet). 

Soon I whent home and showed my parents that I got them. Little did I know my parents got me floor tickes due to my uncle who works at the venue (Thanks uncle). As they showed me the ticket I wondered what to do with the ticket I already had. I was thinking on who should I sell my ticket to? So I called my friend who unfortunately did not get the tickets when they came out. When I told her that I was selling the tickes she told me that I could give them to her for free. I told her no because I work hard for it and I was selling it to her for the same price as I got them. She became outraged. But I hung up on her not wanting to deal with her temper and sold them to a different friend of mine and me and her haven't spoken since. ",3,7

So I was able to buy tickets for the 18th at MetLife in NJ, but Im not really satisfied with my seats. I unfortunately got into the queue too late due to my stupidity and then ended up buying my tickets over the phone way past when they went on sale. With the extra dates announced, I am entertaining the idea of selling my tickets and trying to buy better ones for the second date. I have a few questions, and if anyones able to answer them, Id greatly appreciate it. Ive never done this before!

1) How long does it usually take for tickets through Ticketmaster to arrive in the mail?

2) My tickets are nosebleeds (300s/yellow/Concourse 3) on the side of the stadium, how hard/easy do you think those will be to resell for the same price I paid Ticketmaster (2x $125)? Im just not sure with the second dates added what to expect of the demand. And if I sold them, whats the best way to have the buyer transfer the money?

3) Could anyone who bought tickets in the 200s (red/Concourse 2) or 100s (blue/Concourse 1) at MetLife tell me how much they costed after service fees? Id like to aim for those if I were to try again if theyre within my budget. 

Again, thank you so much if you can answer any of these or offer any advice!!

168,2019-3-4,2019,3,4,8,awzxsk,Why don't we have a lot of information/appreciation for BTS' live band?,predepression,1551654927,"Other post that sparked this discussion for me: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/awrl7x/190303\_hankooki\_music\_director\_of\_btss\_live\_band/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/awrl7x/190303_hankooki_music_director_of_btss_live_band/)

Hey everyone,

Warning: this is a more musically-oriented discussion post. While BTS members are of course some of the best of the best musicians and performers in and of themselves, why isn't there a lot of info and/or appreciation for their live band? I've seen other discussions about BigHit producers, writers, choreographers, and other staffs but little to nothing about the people who play instruments during their live performances or for alternative arrangements of their songs. I may be a little biased here as I have previously played in orchestras for big Christmas productions so I know how vital our role as musicians is to performances as a whole, but still I mean come on. My case in point is [their performance at the 2018 SBS Gayo Daejeon Music Festival](https://youtu.be/-hHPZa3Amr8) (thank you to the fellow ARMY commenter who linked this in another post I was reading). 

After watching this performance, I was simply **BLOWN AWAY** by just how good BTS' live musicians are. Again, for people who do not have a musical background, this aspect often gets pushed to the side when it comes to performances. But seriously, the bass guitarist's licks during No More Dream, the absolutely changed up chord progressions for Dope that make it sound even more *dope* heheh, the drummer during Fire, among other touches by the live musicians just cemented that performance as one of the best I've ever seen. 

While I am grateful for the studio versions of BTS songs, as I am sure we all are, the live musicians' performances and the way that they change up the arrangements of songs is certainly nothing to undermine. What do y'all think about BTS' band (called Ghost, apparently?) and if you have any other recommendations of epic live performances by them please do not hesitate to leave them in the comments so I can be even more amazed lol.

I mostly didn't take pics of them because everything they wear costs way too much lol. I can take this thread down though if it is not allowed): 
[Clothes Picture](https://serving.photos.photobox.com/0717298234edfc9397d935a94767e5758cfe9ee289c1f05e96c4e7e9beb303e2a78d678d.jpg)

Hey guys! I was wondering if any of you might be able to point me in the direction of some places to buy clothes that might be similar to these pictures. I have always thought mens clothing was usually too plain-looking for the most part, but then I started getting more and more into Asian entertainment like kpop and Asian dramas and was particularly impressed with the fashion. I dont really have the confidence to wear things that are too flashy, but I have noticed a number of items that are unique but not too over the top. 

In particular I liked most of the fashion from Dylan Wang in Meteor Garden. A lot of what he wore seemed like stuff I could wear, like the black turtleneck in the pictures, which stood out with the gold circles, or the colourful but not over-the-top pink/purple jacket. In particular I like the jacket hes wearing in the picture in the bottom left corner, with the silver circles on the right collar and the patterns on the left sleeve. I also remember a black sweater or jacket that had cool gold zippers on it, but cannot remember which episode that was. I also really like the jacket Kang Daniel wears in the Beautiful MV (which reminded me of Dylan Wangs) and the black jacket with white writing on the sleeves worn by the actor in Persevere, Goo Hae Ra. 

Of course I dont expect to find these exact items or anything, but Im having difficulty finding any kind of websites or brands with similar fashion. I like in California at the moment, so anything that delivers or is around here would be helpful. I understand a lot of the stuff worn by Asian celebrities and idols is super expensive designer stuff, mostly Im just looking for brands or websites that have fashion of a similar style (in particular stuff that is unique but not too flashy, and by flashy I mean stuff like what BTS wears, which only they could get away with being global superstars lol). In terms of budget I guess a couple hundred USD or maybe more per item wouldnt be too bad. I dont mind buying designer stuff if I really like it, but usually I tend to only buy designer accessories as I feel like clothes wear out too easily to spend 1000s on them lol. Also, I'm not just looking for clothes that look very similar to the ones in the picture, but any clothes/brands of the same style, they could look vastly different, that's okay. Anyway thanks for any help you can provide!! :)

Yes, I know that their next album is *Speak Yourself* so it will probably not develop more on the fictional universe (after all there is that Save Me webtoon to show the full story) and yes I know we already have that ARMYPEDIA puzzle game going on but I'd still love to see hints in their music like in their lyrics or Doki Doki Literature Club style where the audio sounds super distorted and weird but when put through certain settings we can hear something. That would take a lot of coding and stuff though so idk if BTS can do that but if they can that would be very cool. 

I'm not some genius who can uncover every clue but I'd love to see the content that BTS had hidden from the fans in their music videos and songs through others who share their discovery. Basically I'm saying I'm too dumb to figure out most of BTS's music videos or music and come up with theories by myself so I want to see the theories that other people come up with and the small details/hints/clues that they come across.

Hello everyone! This is our first post on Reddit so let me know if there's anything we should change or use another flair, etc. We are a group of moderators (currently 2 but there will be more later) seeking to create a fanzine that follows BTS' journey from the beginning of their debut to the present, showing how theyve evolved over the years.

**What is a fanzine?**

Also known as zines, they are artbooks/anthologies that feature a collection of works centered around a theme. This particular zine will showcase the different eras of BTS, as mentioned above!

The zine will be split into 5 section based on their albums/eras:

* 2Cool4Skool and O!RUL8,2? 
* Skool Luv Affair and Dark &amp; Wild
* Hwa Yong Yeon Hwa Pt. 1 &amp; 2
* WINGS and You Never Walk Alone
* Love Yourself (Her, Tear, Answer)

This will be a for-profit project with SFW content only, and we are hoping to make physical copies of the booklet as well as provide merch (stickers, charms, pins, etc). Right now, were just gathering interest before we proceed so wed really appreciate it if you could fill out our survey below! The form will be open from **March 5th to April 2nd.**

**&gt;** [**INTEREST CHECK FORM**](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSfHyupaDP94H5xc9QKnFc9RkEVggIKm-cozMJfILANA-AlW3A%2Fviewform&amp;t=Yjg5OWZhYmUxMzA4ZTE5ZjNlZTQwM2JkODI3YjJiMzI3MGVlOTc4YSxxc09kcGJHUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AqWnmvBDxyHE5tuplcvnyJQ&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbtseraszine.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183240544282%2Fthe-most-beautiful-eras-in-life-hello-everyone&amp;m=1)

If all goes well, we'll be back to open contributor applications, where we will be looking for artists and writers to participate in the zine! More on the application process when the time comes, though. :)

We also have social media pages listed below so feel free to send us any questions you may have either on this post, on Tumblr, or on Twitter. Rest assured that we have experience working with zines in the past so we know exactly how the process goes and are willing to fully commit to this project!

Note: I've co-translated this long but insightful article with [@BTSARMY\_Salon](https://twitter.com/BTSARMY_Salon). I personally enjoyed it very much. The point is not to praise Big Hit or to ""serve the tea"" but to understand how the industry is reshaping and how we are witnessing the change, or even are making the change. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

The new boy group Tomorrow By Together (TXT) from Big Hit Entertainment, which made its debut yesterday, had no public activities until debut. The members had not appeared on TV programs, such as audition programs, and had not even revealed their voices. Since the first teaser video, which was released on January 10th, Big Hit Entertainment only uploaded teasers on its social media accounts and Naver V Live. However, the first teaser video has now surpassed 15 million views without any promotions on YouTube.

&amp;#x200B;

As of March 3, Big Hit Entertainment has more than 21.5 million YouTube subscribers. The views from TXTs first teaser were to be expected. However, teaser and preview videos posted ahead of the debut week on February 25, 26 and March 1 also had 4.7 million, 4.5 million, and 3.97 million views, respectively. Considering the release dates, the content released later has a better viewership trend. The pattern is opposite to the tendency of idol teasers where usually the first teaser gets the greatest response. It is possible to say that there are many people interested in more specific contents since TXT's first teaser release. This is in a more commercial sense. TXT's debut album, ""The Dream Chapter: STAR"", has already surpassed 100,000 pre-orders two weeks ago, with sales of more than 30,000 on the first day of sale. Their first day sales exceed the sales volume of the first week of a typical rookie boy group. It is the result of 15 videos uploaded on YouTube without any TV appearance, in-house reality show, and Naver V app. Big Hit Entertainment collects interest through social media and knows how to turn that attention into sales.

&amp;#x200B;

While TXT was preparing to make its debut, Big Hit Entertainment launched the ARMYPEDIA event for the BTS fandom, ARMY. This event, which you need to hunt QR codes scattered online and in seven cities around the world, is designed to allow fans to share memories of 2080-day episodes since BTS debut that Big Hit Entertainment picked. After the event was unveiled, ARMYs have been busy gathering QR codes scattered around the globe and recalling memories of BTS. YG Entertainment created a reality show for boy group IKON and WINNER's debut and made G-Dragon and Taeyang of Big Bang appear on the show. Utilizing the most popular team to promote a rookie team is one of the most effective ways to take advantage of the influence of a big agency. Big Hit Entertainment, however, opened the grand event of the world's most popular boy group before the debut of the new group. They did not even show a single picture with TXT and BTS together before TXTs debut. The press release from Big Hit Entertainment does not have expressions like ""the second BTS"" or ""dreaming to be BTS."" From mass media exposure to the use of popular artists in the company, Big Hit Entertainment's TXT debut shows a consistent trend. They chose to be different from the existing large companies so called the Big 3' and, moreover, the traditional Korean pop music industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

After TXTs first teaser release, some fans of BTS debated whether to ""support"" or ""reject"" the team. They expressed their concerns about Big Hit Entertainment over-using BTS to publicize TXT, or neglecting BTS because of the new boy group. ARMYPEDIA, which takes a significant amount of capital and manpower, is a clear signal that Big Hit Entertainment gives to ARMY. Social media subscribers of the company collected through BTS are the base of TXTs promotion. However, there is no way that TXT will disrupt BTS performance, or that the company will lack of resources to support BTS because of TXT. In addition, TXT's debut title single ""CROWN"" has a refreshing atmosphere that contrasts with BTS who had dark rebel characters during their debut. It is very unlikely that fans will feel TXT as a BTS-alike or BTS rival. No one knows exactly what intentions are behind the companys decision. However, as a result, the majority of BTS fandom did not 'reject' TXT.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only ARMY but K-POP fandoms are undergoing drastic changes. You can be interested in other groups produced by the agency of your favorite group, but you do not have to stretch your love"" to other groups anymore just because they are from the same agency. It is common to see conflicts between fandoms in various entertainment companies. Fandoms determine what clothes their favorite group and other groups from the same company wear and which staff members work with them. The idol industry in Korea maximizes sales per consumer through fans enthusiastic focus on artists. Therefore, fans pay attention to everything about their artists. How to direct this energy is many companies current challenge. It is no coincidence that agencies and fandoms of the popular idol groups have recently experienced conflicts. YG Entertainment's crisis is not just about Big Bang member Seungri facing criminal charges. Since debut, members were decided through the reality show ""YG Treasure Box,"" the fans of the related group have been demanding and protesting against producer Yang Hyun Suk. Complaints from fans are endless from member composition, appearance, concept, investment to promotional plans. SM Entertainment's boy group NCT Dream's fandom protested about member Mark being no longer able to act in NCT Dream due to their ""graduation"" system. Some fans of JYP Entertainment's girl group ITZY, who recently made their debut, objected to a particular member, complaining about the team's pre-debut member composition. K-POP fandoms, especially the enthusiastic core fandoms, act as interest groups, or shareholders, who want to go beyond consumers and carry their demands to agencies. Problems that were entirely in the domain of the company in the past now become conflicts, negotiations, and compromises with the fandom.

&amp;#x200B;

Setting aside whether its right or wrong, the demand of the market has completely changed. In fact, it would not be wrong to call it an entire industry from the past. Big Hit Entertainment responds to the change by adopting a different way of operation. It is important that the way Big Hit Entertainment manages BTS and TXT resembles more of the way an IT company would operate than how existing companies do. Various social media channels and Big Hit Entertainments homepage become their platforms, and the company provides the fans with diverse content and events, extending the time the fans spend on the platforms. Although ARMYPEDIA is a huge event that is advertised on billboards in seven cities around the world, it is free. There is no reason for fans to have a major complaint about the service, and as they participate in the event, they get to spend more time on BTS. As all the free content about BTS such as V App, YouTube, mixtapes, and vlogs prove, it eventually converts into money. It could promote a new team from Big Hit Entertainment, like TXT, on a recommended list on a platform where it has more than 21.5 million subscribers. When the company makes the idols fans, who are greatly engaged in activities related to their favorite artist, gladly spend as much time as possible on the companys platforms, fans can show positive reactions to its message.

&amp;#x200B;

BTS active use of social media is mentioned as a reason behind its success. However, given that the essence of K-pop industry is fandoms, idols' use of social media is ultimately the result of understanding fandom of 2019. Fandoms no longer search for their favorite teams' content and info from mass media. Information is spread on Twitter before it is posted on the main page of portal sites. Some people then immediately translate the information into other languages. Big Hit Entertainment, through BTS, touched the areas where mass media can never satisfy the fandom. On the contrary, TXT focused on promoting its color via platforms with global influence. Fandoms reactions differ by teams and by circumstances, and a company should provide content, services, and events that are adequate in each case. An event like ARMYPEDIA only has a meaning when there is a passionate fandom that would enthusiastically record the history of its favorite team, in seven cities around the world. In the process, Big Hit Entertainment let ARMY officially participate in the history of BTS. The company, on its platforms, connects the team and its fandom, and provides a reason why the fandom should consume. This is a question that is on a completely different level where the company comes up with fragmentary ideas or makes good content. This is a question of its essential management vision  what the company does and who the company does it for.

&amp;#x200B;

The entertainment industry has so far been focusing on the changes in the way genres or contents are produced. In K-POP, examples like EXO, which is optimized for simultaneous promotion in Korea and China, and Mnets Produce series where members were selected based on polls, showed some elements of the changes. However, what has really changed are the consumers. As BTS exhibits, the global consumption power of fandom exceeds existing boundaries of K-POP, and the behaviors and active areas of fandom are completely different from the past. Big Hit Entertainment reflected the changes on their management style, including the platforms they operate. BTS and TXT are 7-member and 5-member teams, respectively, which is not very different from the formation of existing K-POP groups. It is also not that they came out with an entirely new music and dance genre. However, the outcomes of Big Hit Entertainment, without anyone noticing, became the standard of the industry. Now everyone manages their social media with the focus on Twitter, YouTube, and V App, like BTS does. It has also been a long time since the activities of idols became something between those of singers and YouTubers. Companies that used to be constantly talking about Japan now publish press releases about the reactions of the American market. Like JYP Entertainments boy group Stray Kids, there are teams that have some elements of BTS at the level of content: hip hop, self-production, youth, rebellion, and albums that make a series. Big Hit Entertainments present is the future of the K-POP industry that has finally come. It is just that some do not realize that it is the future.

&amp;#x200B;

The future began in the past. Everything was already changing -- when BTS was expanding their fandom without appearing on TV entertainment shows, when the reaction videos to their music videos were going viral, when their album sales trend was departing from existing idol groups trends. Billboard Music Awards selected BTS as the winner of the Top Social Artist category two years ago. The American music industry was already paying attention to the amount of mentions on social media and the effect of an enthusiastic fandom like ARMY on the market. However, ironically, Korean production companies and the mass media are not even able to come up with a standard to assess the phenomenon. BTS merchandise, which is produced effectively as a limited edition, gets sold out in no time. Their shows, after selling out two nights of the Wembley stadium, had more than 200,000 people waiting to purchase their tickets. It is a profit structure that is on another level from existing structures of expected revenue from digital music, physical music, and shows in the Asian region. However, the Korean mass media seldom discusses how such a thing is possible. Instead, only quantitative accomplishments such as album sales and sold-out shows are reported, or the translated versions of foreign articles are briefly mentioned. Mass media only talks about what is visible in the same way, and Big Hit made a change in an invisible territory. They have connected a world, comprised of ARMY, in an area that no one had talked about. This, however, is also their tragedy. Unless mass media analyzes the reality and comes up with a standard for assessment, their success can be disparaged or even attributed to luck. The unsubstantiated rumors that BTS couldnt appear on TV shows in their earlier days, which made them focus on social media, which in turn, luckily, made them succeed are still circulating like an urban legend.

&amp;#x200B;

It has a symbolic meaning that BTS failed to get ending stages at music programs of network TV stations at the end of last year. Even in 2018, when they seemed to have done everything a Korean musician could do, the network TVs did not give them ending stages. However, it is also true that the status of a team like BTS is no longer affected by whether or not it gets an ending stage. The world has changed, but the mass media does not admit it. And many production companies, while they clumsily position themselves between these two, only focus on creating content that superficially follows the latest trend. All this ignorance, neglect, misunderstanding, and prejudice make the K-pop industry a pathetic, bland industry that judges success and superiority only based on the aggregate market value and achieving #1 on Melon chart.

&amp;#x200B;

The operating profit of Big Hit Entertainment in 2017 was higher than that of SM, JYP, and YG Entertainment, which are called the Big 3 management companies. Many securities companies and experts forecast that Big Hits revenue and operating profit almost tripled in 2018. However, if this is the end of story, Big Hit Entertainment will merely remain as the first of the Big 3, or one of the Big 4. However, this company, like the Big 3 had done sometime in the past, found the new driving force of the market and responded differently from the Big 3. Big Hit Entertainment has set up its territory on a different time and space from the Big 3. Whether it is good or bad, it is a completely different world compared to the past. Big Hit Entertainment has brought a future from somewhere. How will we take this fact? Are we even going to admit it? The future of K-POP will begin from these questions.",28,100

Do you have any encouraging stories of enjoying BTS together?

Note that may be relevant: My boyfriend actually dislikes most pop music and anything ""inauthentic"" (and k-pop can come across that way). He likes rap/hip-hop (Kanye West is a favorite), the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and David Bowie. He did watch the Spring Day music video with me and said it was ""better than he expected.""

""It's never intended but it feels like I'm using you guys to love myself (?)"" 

""Please use bts to love yourself""

https://i.redd.it/m3wrjzwb60l21.png

I've been thinking about this tattoo for a long time. It's evolved and changed considerably from the original idea I had. Today I finally got it. It's been...over 10 years since I had a tattoo - I don't rush into them as prior to this, I only had 2. Of the three, this one means the most to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The short story is, like many at this point, that BTS, as a whole and even individually, have had a profound effect on the state of my life. How I view myself and what I do for myself has changed dramatically in large part thanks to the existence of these 7 people. I am still endlessly amazed by this. I've come a long way to reach the point of loving myself. It's not perfect, probably never will be, but it's still good. 

&amp;#x200B;

For this tattoo I figure, if life says that one day the fangirl in me calms down, it will never change the meaning. Love yourself. I will always remember, and I will always grateful.

Let's pretend that it is 2013 and Big Hit has just dropped these teasers for their new rookie group Bangtan Sonyeondan. Watch their intro teasers for No More Dream, [\#1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjEnJif3mGM) &amp; [\#2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7rUjOadhwo). Then, based soley on the teasers, who do you pick as your bias for the new rookie group BTS?

&amp;#x200B;

Jimin snatched my ass again, but Rap Monster ^(teehee) looks so commanding. 

The first time I saw these, it was Jimin &amp; V, then as the years have gone by I couldn't pick a true bias if my life depended on it. I'm definitely OT7.

&amp;#x200B;

So who is your bias for this rookie group Bangtan Sonyeondan?

I know that this message are for haters

But lets apply it to our fandoms too. The antis/haters will just hate more, I understand that some of them didnt listen even listen to their music and hated them because other people hate it, or its because our fandom is annoyingly toxic. Just ignore those people, but there are some mature haters that took their time to listen to one of their music and finally made a valid opinion. I love those kinds because of how open minded they are and can protect their opinions maturely, you can take time debating with those.

Army lets try and put our own to their shoes and be humble, like our humble idols. 

If our old method is not working (fighting with the haters)

Why not change the tactic and just ignore them. Stop putting oit to the fire because it will get stronger.

As I said be humble you might be thinking they are putting gas to ours too 
One needs to give up so the haters will calm down.

Be humble like our idols.

I  you!

If you look at their recent Happily Ever After, their costume colors are the same as the bow ties.

[Happily Blu-ray](https://www.amazon.com/BTS-BANGTAN-BOYS-Photobook-Photocards/dp/B07J6TSM5Q/ref=pd_day0_hl_201_1/138-3880898-0168941?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07J6TSM5Q&amp;pd_rd_r=5d6aa783-43ab-11e9-a824-df4daa8f2bd1&amp;pd_rd_w=qY5j5&amp;pd_rd_wg=qDkKX&amp;pf_rd_p=ad07871c-e646-4161-82c7-5ed0d4c85b07&amp;pf_rd_r=N8HSRK20CDXSKMTWS2JN&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=N8HSRK20CDXSKMTWS2JN)

In their Snow White Halloween dance practice, the colors are mostly in this pattern, too (But no pink dwarf, so red instead for Suga, and Tae has a dress).

In this Euphoria shot, the only one not wearing ""his color"" in some way is Joon (no purple).

Sorry if this post seems kind of throwaway, and maybe it will be scrapped, but I searched here and online to see if anyone has ever pointed out this wardrobe detail, and I couldn't find any reference to it. Of course they wear all kinds of colors at different times, but I don't think this particular choice is merely coincidence. If they do each have a signature color, I thought that might be an additional little detail to know about the group in conjunction with their hands, freckles, piercings, etc, etc....

Please help :(,yucuizhu,1552275076," \*disclaimer: this post is not intended to say ANYTHING negative about BTS AT ALL. I love the group and all of the members so so much, this is more of a personal issue that I needed advice on.

so about two months ago I fell \*real deep\* into this amazing world of BTS, and since then I've binged all the RUN episodes, listen to their albums basically every second I am not at school, and have just immersed myself completely into the fandom.  I pretty much eat, breathe, sleep BTS, and I have loved every second of it. However, recently I realized that it's really beginning to consume my life. I've started to procrastinate on all my school work (to the point where I'm seeing my grades drop a lot), and stopped communicating with people around me as much because most of my time is spent reading fanfiction, watching videos, and scrolling through their social media.  Actually over mid-winter break, I stayed in bed for 9 hours each day doing just that. I feel so panicked because I know I can't live forever in a state like this, but a part of me DOES want to do this forever, because BTS has brought so much joy and wonder into my life and I can't imagine ever leaving the fandom. 

I know that for some people BTS has motivated them to work harder, but for me, every time I try to tear myself away, I feel an intense wave of nostalgia and longing that just nags at me until I put my attention back on BTS-related content. I'm really scared because I don't want to live a stagnant life; I want to be improving myself and chasing my dreams (just like they are doing at the moment), but it's so damn hard to really do anything productive when all I want to do is bury myself under the covers and binge more BTS videos. 

Have any of you ever felt this way? Do you have any advice? ",42,87

##An FAQ about moderating:  
 
* **What the job entails**: 70% of the job is removing posts that break the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules), posting the reason for why it was removed, and sometimes defending/changing your decision. The rest of the time is split between finding out what the general sub community wants/their opinions on rules, and figuring out what would best keep the sub happy and healthy. It also involves planning fun events sometimes, like the [50k sub event](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/armxbt/rbangtan_50k_subscriber_eventgiveaway_thread/) a while back ;) So you need to know the rules pretty well, be able to make judgments based on those rules as unbiased-ly as possible (nobodys perfect!), and be able to communicate with the community and rest of the mod team in a diplomatic and non-inflammatory way.  
* **How active do I need to be?:** Depends on the day. Some days require less removals than others. Any time there's a big event (BBMAs, Grammys, etc), it requires a lot more attention than, say, a day like today. During comeback season we pretty much need all hands on deck all day as often as possible. But for a sub of this size right now (and keep in mind it's growing every day), it's generally fine if a mod is checking the sub and dealing with reports and removals about every 30 minutes or so. We currently *really* need someone to fill in the timezone mentioned above, even if its closer to every hour or two during that time window.  
* **Is being a moderator permanent?:** No. If you ever have any real life issues that would prevent you from actively modding, you are welcome to leave at any time. That being said, if you know you have a big life change coming up that will stop you from modding, or will only be active during certain parts of the year, we urge you not to apply. Having to find and train new moderators to do this job takes quite a bit of work for the old mods too, and wed prefer to do it as little as possible. We like having a tight-knit core team :)    
* **Can I still interact with the community?:** Yep! You can still comment all you like about how Jungkooks newest Twitter selca made you UwU if you wish. However, being a moderator may make it more difficult to interact on contentious discussion posts. If theres a chance of it being removed later, and you said you disagreed with OP in the thread, some people will think its the moderator being biased and removing something just because they didnt like it. (This is never true FYI, we always consult other mods before removing something we know were biased about to make sure we arent acting purely out of bias). Moderating can also take time out of your day, so rather than typing out a comment for an hour, youll instead opt for a quick sentence. That doesnt mean you cant interact in ANY discussion posts or disagree with anyone ever - just be mindful of which ones you *are* commenting in, and how youre wording it!  
* **Why should I become a mod?:** Because its fun (sometimes)! For real though, if you want to become a mod, the best reason you could have is a passion for this community and a desire to keep it from falling into chaos. This feeling has kept me going for almost 4 years now, and if you love BTS and love the more moderated style of this message board, youll probably get a lot of mileage out of doing this (fun) job too! (Theres a similar question about this on the moderator app - dont just repeat what I said here! You can get more personal about what I said - and there are also good reasons besides what Ive said here!)

&amp;#x200B;

My 9 year old daughter is turning 10 in April and all she wanted was to go the BTS concert but I tried (TWICE) but couldn't get tickets but she was heart-broken. Anyways so I ended up ponying up to buy resale tickets.  (Damn these are some expensive tickets). But we're a family of 4 and now I can only send her and my wife , which is fine. Her 15-year old brother doesn't get her obsession with BTS and I'm 45 - certainly not the BTS demo.   


I have questions:  


1. How early to arrive?
2. She said we absolutely need something called a lightstick. I tried to buy on the official site but it's sold-out. Will we be able to buy these on site? I see them on Amazon for 2-3x what I see on the website. Are these legit?

With them coming back on April 12th, I think many of us are assuming that our boys will attend and perform at the May 1st BBMAS.

Im am totally excited at the prospect but then I remember both of their performances at the BBMAS and the AMAs werent any different that a weekly music show performance. 

But when they perform at Korean Award shows they put on a utterly glorious extravaganza.

Which makes me wonder, why arent they bringing that kind of goodness to the US shows?

On the one hand, I realize no US show is going to give them 10 -15 minutes to flex like they do in Korea. But I truly believe they can come up with a killer 5 minute performances that are similar to how to do it in Korea.

So what do you think? Are Big Hit playing it safe? Or do you think the producers of the US award shows only allowed them to do the basics? Maybe because they were newbies?

Would you want a more elaborate performance at the US awards shows?",61,91

""BTS success was not a coincidence... as a result of [Bighit's] relentless efforts, it brought kpop into mainstream around the world."" 

Basically, the narrative about BTS success seems to be shifting from organic growth, bts themselves + armys dedication, to bts, bighit's marketing preparation, and bang pd's formula for success. 

I understand that they may say this for investors and other purposes, and maybe I am looking too much into it, but it personally doesn't sit well with me. I think disrespect is too strong a word to use but it definitely feels like the efforts, especially of US armys during 2017, are being forgotten in the narrative of BTS breaking into the US market.

I've been a fan of BTS since LY:Tear and instead of toning down on my fangirling, the love and respect I have for them is only deepening each and every day and it shows. The love is overflowing and following what BTS is up to has become a very significant part of my daily life. But I am the only one in my friend circle. 

Not everyone knows about it as I'm not the one to shove the fact that I am an ARMY in everyone's faces (although I think that the fact is bound to surface sooner or later due to how significant they are in my current state of life), but some of my friends and family do and the majority of their reactions have been wildly.. underwhelming. One of my friends thinks I am straight up crazy and obsessesed and ""should seek help lol"" and now relates all of my other interests to the assumption that I'm just doing it for this group that I'm so obsessed about - like watching K-Dramas, reading books I know about thanks to Bangtan or even travelling to different countries, which only reinforces his opinion that I'm mental.

Another one has asked me what is it about BTS so I wrote her a very long paragraph trying to carefully highlight all the reasons we love BTS - lyrics, kindness, dynamics between the members, relatability - and she just said: I think you're a little crazy.  And there are more.   
I also need to stay away from mentioning anything korean - lwhen I'm talking to my friends about movies and tv shows, I would love to recommend ones that happen to be Korean but I would immediately get dismissed because I am ""obsessed with Korean culture"".

Don't get me wrong, I'm very proud of myself for looking up to Bangtan out of all celebrities I could look up to and no other opinion of my close minded friends would change it but their reactions have seriously discouraged me from even mentioning BTS in any context whatsover in front of them, because I don't want to be tagged as ""crazy"" or a koreaboo all the time.

I'm 15 1/2, and I just got tickets to see BTS at MetLife Stadium on May 19 for an early birthday gift! I wanted to ask r/bangtan if you all know if there is a mandatory age to go in alone. I've read around the internet that in order to enter a BTS concert by yourself, you need to be at least 16, but from what I've read, this is mostly in Korea. Does anybody know if the rule of being 16 in order to enter the concert by yourself applies in the States? 

Also, do they sell ARMY bombs at the concerts? If they do, how much are they? And how much are the t-shirts and sweatshirts at BTS concerts usually? Is it wise to arrive early in order to line up for merchandise early?

I need help.

So I pre-ordered the The Notes:English Version and according to the website the shipment of the book starts on March 3rd(?). And my order history in the official website shows that the payment has failed, even though I have an official email from the store and also message from my bank saying that the money had been deducted.

The problem is i'll be leaving the country soon and completely miscalculated how much time it would take for the shipment to reach(thought it wouldn't take more than 10 days).And the only email mentioned I have seen on the website is [support@bighit.com](mailto:support@bighit.com) 

1) How long does it take for the book to be shipped to your location usually? (especially if you are from Middle East region)?

2) what are the email-ids i can contact  for resolving this issue?

3) how long does it take for them to reply back?

I doubt this will be a stand-alone album, and Im predicting three albums for this new series (similar to the LY series with the last album being a repackage/compilation album). I was looking through [this explanation of the 4 major Jungian archetypes](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-jungs-4-major-archetypes-2795439) linked by a fellow ARMY and if they are going to use these archetypes for their titles/concepts, then my prediction is as follows (this is all speculation):

&amp;#x200B;

**Map of the Soul: Persona**

Confirmed mini album. This will be a lighter concept exploring different ways that the members (and humans in general) present themselves to others and the world. Might include some criticizing of society, but remain fairly light in general, especially considering the apparent pink design of this album. XD

&amp;#x200B;

**Map of the Soul: Shadow**

A full-length album exploring weaknesses, prejudice, the unknown, darkness, etc. Personally, I would love if the concept was REALLY dark and included a dark and sensual (though not excessively sexual) mv that blows BST out of the water and really solidifies a mature concept for BTS. Am I asking too much? If this hypothetical album has this sort of concept/sound, it might become my favorite album.

&amp;#x200B;

**Map of the Soul: Self**

Like I said, I think this series will have three albums, especially since I dont think they would end with the Shadow album. Since we already have the Highlight Reels, I doubt they would cover the Anima/Animus archetype (similar to how there wasn't an album for ""Wonder""), and this theme seems like a good concept to end on (the unified individual, a cohesive self, etc.). This will be a repackage/compilation album and provide a nice ending and wrapping up of the series.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some additional questions:**

Each album (so far) contains a solo intro. Who do you think is going to do these intros?

Do you think we will get sub units?

Do you think we will get another solo song from each member?

Do you think we will get more videos similar to the Highlight Reels, Wings short films, or LY intros?

Will we finally get a Cypher Part V?

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, this is all pure speculation. I might be completely wrong on everything, but I just wanted to share my thoughts and hear what you all think. Feel free to discuss.",37,54

I'm usually just a lurker here but I recently faced a problem where I need your advice!

Not that long ago I ordered the 4th Muster Happy ever after from the Bighit shop, even tho I was pleasantly suprised by how quick it arrived, my excitement still died down quickly when I saw the state the DVDs were in.
tbh I even thought I would have gotten it secondhand for a moment until I remembered that the DVD was sealed just seconds ago.

Of course I don't blame Bighit for it, this must have been just an unlucky coincidence that I have gotten a bad one and they can't possibly check every Item they are about to sell, especially not if its sealed, so I'm not really mad over them regarding that topic.

Well here comes the issue I'm having rn:
I then wrote an email to the Shop, to the support email that also sends the confirmation emails, since it literally was ""support@bighit..."", explained my issue, attached pictures and asked if maybe an exchange would be possible for me to do.
This happened a week ago and I still haven't gotten an email back.

Am I just stupid and wrote to the wrong email or what am I supposed to do?
what are your experiences with the Bighit Shop support?

Here is btw an attachment of the state the 4th muster was in:

The BTS members themselves (7)
The BT21 characters (8)
And lastly their characters from the Save Me webcomic (7)

I thought about putting We On: Be the Shield and their Hip Hop Monsters, but there just isnt enough room for all of those! But I also have 2 spaces left to fill and I dont know who to put...
For one of them I thought Id put the magical white dog/cat thing from the webcomic, since it seems pretty significant, but that still leaves me with one spot left. Any ideas? And how would you make your ideal BTS Guess Who game?",0,1

Personally I think that it may be a more hip-hop song  just because of the Cuban links that their jeweller said one of the members ordered for the music video. However with the title of the album and the pink album packaging it suggest a more soft theme maybe a ballad type song like Spring Day. What do you guys think?,72,82

So this morning I was happily watching a rehearsal of 2018 MMA Idol when, at about 5:25 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi7o-cnmBZU), Hobi turned his head to look toward the front and I gasped. There was something about his focus and unleashed power in that moment that forced me to pause the video and take a moment to  catch my breath.  

This happens a lot when I watch Hobi perform or rehearse because the difference between his ""ball-of-sunshine"" face and his ""let's get down to business"" face is stark.  But it happens with the other guys too. 

For me, heart-skipping moments happen most often when the guys are in the middle of doing their job, e.g., performing, rehearsing, being interviewed.  But it can sometimes happen when they're just goofing around, too.  Check out Yoongi at the end of [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzSSojnPl98)

1) JM might been se**ally assaulted in there
2) JM saw a murder in there

As for me, I tend to believe that No. 2 is more accurate.
I become more confident after reading Save Me ep. 12 ( this episode is so heartbreaking and triggering at the same time )
and after reading The Notes 1 ( while reading this, I kept visualizing Euphoria scenes and ofc it makes me understand more the storyline)
&gt;!there is a news article reporting a missing 5 year old was found (alive/dead?) at the hill, which is obviously near the arboretum, by a hiker!&lt;

Another clue, in LIE teaser, there is a gun shot sound..so probably a murder involving a gun ? 

So far, IMO, I think JM's story is the most heartbreaking ones 
It reminds me of a kdrama I Remember You/ Hello Monster, in which &gt;!Park Bogum saw a murder when he still a kid and it affected him so much that he became a psychopath!&lt;

We're really looking to just make our money back on the tickets or even less, just getting most back would be nice. Buying them was a mistake in the first place because we don't want to spend the money to travel out there again. We're in Tx and also just saw them at the L.A. Staples Center last September. 

If you're interested just shoot me a PM, we have them listed on VividSeats I believe it's called right now. My girlfriend deals with the tickets so I'm not sure of the details, but if you're serious about buying them I'll get you all of the information through PM. We would be willing to lower the price selling to a fellow ARMY on Reddit, we are just worried we won't get our money back and as the concert date approaches the more worried I get so if anyone is interested please let us know it would be a huge help to us and we will give you a small discount on the tickets as well. 

What I do know is the seats are directly across from the stage looking at it straight on. I believe they are pretty high up. Right now they're competitively listed at $190, but as I said before the price could be lowered for one of you guys!

\- I've already spent a lot of money on the ticket/am going to spend money on airplane tickets to get up there, so I'm trying to limit my spending (I'm not even going to try to get near the merch tables.)

\- I'm the sort of person who is going to end up having their phone out most of the time so I don't know how much I'd actually end up using it even if I did get one. (And yes I know there will be other people there taking much better pictures and videos and I should really be focusing on the concert, but I have memory problems so personally for me taking pictures is sometimes the only way I can remember stuff.)

\- What do you do with it afterwards? I have no idea if/when I'll ever actually get to go to another BTS concert. Can I take it to other concerts/use it for other stuff? How do they work?

833,2019-3-19,2019,3,19,9,b2qau3,190318 Forbes: Is BTS Already Headed For Another No. 1 Album?,FakeuLarb,1552954638,"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/03/18/is-bts-already-headed-for-another-no-1-album/#89cf1cf5690c](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/03/18/is-bts-already-headed-for-another-no-1-album/#89cf1cf5690c)

Its been  less than a year since K-pop outfit BTS made history by becoming the  first act from their genre to score a No. 1 album in the U.S. with their  full-length *Love Yourself: Tear*.  That one accomplishment would have been a career high for most groups,  but the Bangtan Boys (another name theyve been known by) didnt rest on  their success, instead prepping another album almost immediately. The  follow-up record, *Love Yourself: Answer*,  was released in August, and it, too, went straight to the peak of the  Billboard 200, making them one of the few acts that have landed a pair  of leaders in the same calendar year. 

As is their typical way of working, BTS is already back with new music, and the vocal group has announced a new album entitled *Map of the Soul: Persona*,  which will drop on April 12. Three albums in less than a year is an  incredible amount of music for any musicians to create, but is it too  much for fans...or will BTS collect a third No. 1 on the Billboard 200  when it arrives?

The evidence suggests theyre on their  way to making that exceptionally rare feat happen, but are there any  other acts that could stop them? 

Perhaps their greatest competition  when it comes to claiming the No. 1 with their upcoming release is  pop/jazz singer-songwriter and pianist Norah Jones, whose new record *Begin Again* is  slated to be made available the same day. Jones has released half a  dozen records now, and the lowest position shes had to settle for when  it comes debuts is No. 3, while three of them have topped the Billboard  200. Most of her records open with over 100,000 units, though her most  recent effort, 2016s *Day Breaks*,  didnt even make 50,000 in its first frame. Even if she inches back  toward her usual selling figures, it might only move about half as many  units as BTS most recent No. 1, which launched with 185,000 equivalent  units, most of which were sales. 

Behind Jones, a handful of titles could begin their time on the Billboard 200 inside the top 10Anderson .Paaks *Ventura*, Melissa Etheridges *The Medicine Show*  and perhaps even LSDs (the supergroup featuring Sia, Labrinth and  Diplo) self-titled debutbut none of them will challenge BTS for the  throne. 

When predicting future chart-leading  albums, its also smart to look not only at what else will be released  on the same day, but what came out in the week(s) prior. The frame  before *Map of the Soul: Persona* arrives, only Khalids *Free Spirit*,  which has a good shot at going to No. 1 upon arrival, will likely hold  on inside the top 10 for a second stint, though its second-week  figuresshouldn't be enough to hold powerhouses like BTS back.

Perhaps the only thing that could derail  BTS chances of scoring a third No. 1 album in less than 12 months is a  surprise release from one of the music industrys superstars, and thats  always nearly impossible to predict. If, say, Rihanna, Lady Gaga,  Taylor Swift or a hip-hop favorite like Drake or Eminem came out of  nowhere with another full-length, they may have a shot at winning the  week...but at the moment, there arent enough rumblings and rumors to  give the K-pop heavyweights reason to worry.",33,161

Joon - Gabumon, since they're both very calm and thoughtful 

Jin - Definitely Palmon, considering how obsessed they both are with their looks!

Hobi - I can see him with Veemon since they're both just bundles of energy and positivity 

Yoongi - Tentomon, especially to lighten him up like he did with Izzy 

Tae - Ranamon to complement his mysterious and zen personality 

Jimin - Patamon, obviously

836,2019-3-19,2019,3,19,10,b2rb8g,Has BTS helped anyone rediscover their ethnic identity?,tacoboutluv,1552960197,"I'm wondering if BTS, as an Asian group, has sparked anyone to be curious or want to engage more in their own ethnic identity. Of course this question is open to every ethnic identity in any region, but my story is about my Asian identity in a Western society.

I'm Vietnamese and I grew up consuming mostly Chinese and Vietnamese entertainment. My friends who shared similar interests were also into Korean and Japanese entertainment so I was pretty familiar with the cultural differences between the content/images in Asian vs. Western media. Asian entertainment played a huge role in my upbringing. It definitely helped me stay connected to my Asian identity and I credit it for my ability to speak Vietnamese fluently.

I somehow lost touch with this entertainment in my last few years of high school, then I moved away for uni and I'm now deep in my Ph.D studies. I'm finally starting to notice a sort of...ethnic isolation, if you will. It wasn't until I started stanning BTS last year that I realized how disconnected I was to my ethnic identity. Upon reflection, I think one reason why I love BTS so much is because they are Asian. Their content instilled this **indescribable comfort** in me. I didn't even know how important my Asian identity was to me until I felt this newfound *comfort*. Although the English translations are never perfect, the feeling of understanding their meanings because I know the ""Asian cultural values/mentality"" was fulfilling. I suddenly felt the nostalgia of being truly bi-cultural and now all I desire is to rediscover that.

I know that *Asian* is not a homogenized group and Koreans are very distinct from other Asian ethnicities. But this identity I am trying to describe goes beyond being just *Vietnamese* or *Korean*. Even hearing the Korean language makes me feel closer to ""home"" (even though I was born in Canada and not Korean). My feelings are probably also due to the fact that I have no co-ethnic friends and I live away from my family rather than just a lack of Asian media consumption. But BTS triggered something in me and I am now trying to reconnect with being Asian and Asian media.

Does anyone share these feelings? Has stanning BTS brought anyone closer to their ethnic/Asian identity, even if it's not to the same extent. I would love to hear your stories and comments.",48,144

But there is also actually some truth to the way I'm reacting to this. 

So, my sister got super into K-pop and she showed my mom some k-pop videos, and my mom keeps going on about how she looks like one of the female k-pop stars in the video she showed her. My sister is very pretty and has a lot of the features that seem to align with Korean beauty standards. I don't know K-pop that well, but I wanted to know if there was anyone I looked like, because I wanted to stroke my vain ego. 

My sister goes ""you actually look a lot like Jungkook from BTS but when he was 16"". Keep in mind, I'm female. She really couldn't come up with a female idol that remotely resembled me? I share a lot of the same features as my sister. A LOT of people actually mistaken us for each other. So there's no way I don't look like ANY female idol. But also, I'm literally the same age as Jungkook. She couldn't just say I looked like Jungkook? Why when he was 16? I'm sorry but nobody looks good when they're 16. Now I'm not saying he's not a good looking guy, but he indisputably looks a LOT better now than when he was 16. 

 I asked her why when he was 16. She said cause now he looks too much like a man and I'm not manly looking. IF I'M NOT MANLY LOOKING, THEN WHY CHOOSE A MALE IDOL?! She says that I have softer features cause I'm a girl, so I look like him before he finished puberty cause his features weren't as manly then. And I said ""but don't you agree that at 16 he wasn't as good looking as he is now?"" and she went ""Oh yeah, cause he hadn't grown into his features yet"". So she's saying I look like him BEFORE he grew into his features!? She says that's not what she meant but that's what she SAID. 

She said I look like a female version of him, and then she said I look like I could be his little sister. but I'm actually a couple months OLDER than him. Why couldn't she say I just looked like his sister? Why his LITTLE sister? Is she saying I look like a 16 year old's little sister? Cause then she's saying I look even younger than 16?! Just everything she said, she just kept digging herself deeper and deeper towards insulting me even though she says she was trying to compliment me. 

She SAYS she meant it as a compliment, and that anyone who's a fan of BTS would know that saying someone looks like 16 year old Jungkook would be a compliment. Well I guess I don't know that, so I figured who's better to ask than a bunch of BTS fans. As an adult female, would you consider looking like a 16 year old Jungkook a compliment? I personally don't consider looking like a 16 year old boy a compliment, no matter how good looking they are, because here's the thing: 16 year old boys aren't attractive (to me). I'm just trying to prove a point to my sister. ",2,0

889,2019-3-20,2019,3,20,12,b36uvn,Implimenting jukebox concept,_Viken__,1553051335,"Only suggesting, but what about implementing a weekly/monthly jukebox discussion like [r/kpop](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop)[/r/popheads](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads) sometimes do (of course only with both new and old bts songs). I think it will bring fun and active interaction between ARMY of this sub and a good way for newer ARMY to listen to  anf bring awareness of Bangtan's old music/gems

For those not familiar with the jukebox concept:

* Each week you'll get the chance to review songs e.g. 3-5 per week, both old and new. these threads are meant to discuss and share a variety of opinions on songs, which will be collected and archived altogether. Although the end goal is to get an overall ranking of a song on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being ""bad"" and 10 being ""good""), it really is just a chance for people to discuss songs they really like, really dislike, or perhaps have never heard before and want to leave their first thoughts on. The rankings are meant to be an introductory guide to any k-pop fan that wants to explore a wide range of songs and find recommendations, both old and new. These scores aren't supposed to be taken as absolute truth; everyone has individual preference and at the end of the day, the average mean score a song is given is an aggregate of a wide spectrum of thoughts, feelings, and overall opinions. That's the beauty of music, it's a subjective experience and everyone listens to each song differently.

I have been trying to sell 3 extra tickets of mine on Tumblr and a Twitter I just made (I can give you both the @'s) but all the buyers have fallen through so far. I created a Reddit account because I thought I might try on here but I'm not reddit savvy so I hope everyone sees this...

I'm not a scammer, I bought this ticket above face value on StubHub as a Mobile Transfer from Ticketmaster and I have my SH confirmation email, my two Ticketmaster transfer confirmation emails, and a video of myself opening the ticket in my ticketmaster account in the app on my phone. Everything including a screenshot of the actual ticket marked up I can send to your email except for the video (too long), that I can DM you on Twitter, Tumblr, or if you can DM on here...great, I have no idea. I'll even Skype or FaceTime on my Mac if you want and open the ticket on my phone app.

 I'll be more than happy to negotiate the price. I'm hoping to get as close to what I paid back but as long as I sell it regardless that's more important to me, so I'm providing a range and you can feel free to offer whatever you'd like to.

**Ticket details:**

**Location:** Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ

**Date:** May 19

**Ticket:** Section 10 Row 40 Seat 7

**Delivery:** Mobile Transfer via Ticketmaster

**Payment:** PayPal G&amp;S (goods and services)

**Cost of Ticket:** Paid $557

For those of you who've seen them live, what was your experience of each members stage presence? Anything unexpected based on impressions you got from MVs or live recordings?

For those who've attended multiple concerts, did you observe any change over the years or over different locations in how Bangtan comes across on stage?

is the BTS Themed Cafe in Taipei legal? I don't think they were ""allowed"" by BTS,

but I guess since its just a display of memorabilia and not selling any products related to BTS, its okay?

We have a couple of things to announce today:

#New moderators

As announced [10 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/azy4tb/wanted_new_moderators_for_rbangtan/), we opened up applications for new moderators. Out of the 30 responses submitted, we found our two new mods: please welcome **/u/hannahviolet and /u/little_green_woman**!

Be gentle as our newest members take some time to learn the ropes. Remember that you can always reach the whole squad by sending a modmail either by clicking ""message the moderators"" on the sidebar or designating a private message to ""/r/bangtan"".

#Reports

Lately, we've had an uptick of reports about things **not actually prohibited by our rules**. To clear up a few misunderstandings, here are things you **don't** need to report:

* **Normal marketplace threads.** They don't count as self-promotion. You can see a summary of the self-promotion guidelines in [the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules).
* **Mentions of other artists.** It's not prohibited to utter the names of other groups and artists on /r/bangtan. Please report these only if they cross the line into bashing or break any other rule we have in place.
* **All fanart.** Please report fanart only if it breaks an actual rule (doodles, self-promotion, tattoos, explicit content etc).

#Other things

* Please use **modmail** instead of sending private messages to individual mods. Especially avoid using the real-time chat  this function is only visible on desktop and we might not even see your message until way after the fact. Modmail is almost always preferable.
* **The weekly thread** can't always be stickied on the front page, as we sometimes need the sticky spots for other threads (we can only have two at a time). But the most recent thread can always be found **linked on the header bar**. On redesign it's under ""Threads"" on the header. On mobile apps you should see the header links in the same place you see other sidebar information.

As of writing this post, we are getting close to 55k subscribers! For all new subscribers (and as a reminder to old ones too), here are all the resources to get you up to speed:

\- Run: The lyrics are kind of sad, but the vibe that it gives and the MV really give a happy nostalgia sensation, like... You just feel like you can do anything

Hi! The blue top is too small (size M) for me and the purple fleece is also too small as the seller mistakenly sent a size S instead of a size L.

Asking for 24 for the top and for 38 for the bottom. Shipping from France, willing to ship anywhere as long as you pay for it :) I can send more photos! ",1,18

&amp;#x200B;

I was bored so I decided to start a topic. Since we're entering a new era, how much do you think the concert setlists will change?

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot speak for the SY concerts coming up, but IMO they'll start singing only from Fire onwards (otherwise those setlists will be too long!). I think they'll keep Fire, Bapsae, BST (I hope it comes back in full glory), DNA, FL, Idol. If the first of the Persona series is an EP maybe we might get more throwbacks. But if we get individual tracks again I don't know. Any thoughts?",1,4

The concept of jukebox is rather simple, each week you'll be given the chance to review  four songs made by BTS. The songs included will range from title tracks to own release music. The songs will be randomly chosen each week, however I though that for the first edition of jukebox we would go with an old school bangtan theme. Before we begin here is some simple rules about jukebox:

1. Each review must come with a score between 1 - 10, inclusive.
2. Every review should be at least 80 words long and provide some sort of insight into the song. Blind stanning and trolling is not allowed, but you are encouraged to be creative and have fun with your review(s). This is not a hard rule: if you can be creative, fun, and substantive in less than 80 words, go for it!
3. Downvoting someone's comment/rate doesn't change the overall score.  The scores assigned to the song will be averaged regardless of downvotes. 
4. Deadline for scores to be considered into the final ranking end saturday the following week.                                                                                                                                                                                        

***^(\[Source:  Jukebox #1: It's A Sweet Sensation, Oh What a Situation posted by)*** **^(u/ griffbendor)** ***^(at)*** **^(r/ kpop)*****^(\])***

Well without further to do, here is the songs for this week:

1. [Paldogangsan ""Satoori rap""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI8ozG_jWcw)  ***- O!RUL8,2?, 2013***

*^(Deadline: 30-03-2019 18:00 CET)* 

 Please your review as a reply to my comment with the song title and keep in mind only scores between 1 - 10 is allowed. Have fun reviewing fellow ARMY!

Joon started their early albums (except SLA which was the whole rapline). Yoongi started the hyyh series, hobi started wings and so on.

So given how all the members are done at least once will we get another Joon rap intro? Just like the start? Or will it be something different like a whole group song?

Given how much throwbacks we have been getting recently with armypedia, and how epiphany 's end implied about going back to the beginning to search for the map of your soul maybe their trailer too will be a throwback kind of thing with a Joon intro ? What do you guys think?",92,97

I feel like a history lesson is needed. Now I dont claim to be an expert, but based on the bullshit accusations that were thrown at them at the time like flow jacking and rapping over other songs, its clear to me their accusers didnt even know the basics of hip hop or how it got started.

If you have the time, here is a nice article about rap and hip hops origins 

https://genius.com/Bmxe-the-history-of-hip-hop-music-annotated

But let me bring forth this excerpt 

***Hip hop as music and culture formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables to extend the breaks. Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum-machines became widely available and affordable. Turntablist techniques developed along with the breaks and the Jamaican toasting vocal style was used. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks along with an instrumental or synthesized beat. The first hip hop record is widely regarded to be The Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight"", from 1979.***

I cant emphasize enough that Rappers Delight was just a group of guys rapping over Chics Good Times with some turn table mixing thrown in.

That is how hip hop got started. A DJ would mix Records on his turn table, stealing from disco, soul, jazz, and sometimes even classical music or music sound tracks. Nothing was off limits. The MC (Master of Ceremonies) would rap over it to get the crowd going. While b-boys would dance to their new grooves with their own unique style.

So everything that BTS was doing in their early days was classic hip hop. I think the worst thing they could be accused of is copying the hip hop aesthetic of big chains and fake Afros. But they have clearly evolved from that.

Now I was to say, hip hop is for EVERYONE. I think when it becomes an issue for some hip hop fans is when other dont understand or appreciate the origins of it, only care about copying the aesthetics of it and dont bring their unique perspective to the table.

And we all know that is exactly what BTS does. Especially the rap line.  Their lyrics are VERY personal. They talk about what effects them and their peers, especially in Korea. Even then, its still universally relatable.

They have even managed to bring in Korean music with songs like Ddaeng and their Idol performance at the Melon Music Awards. WHO ELSE HAS DONE THAT!?

So the next time any k-hip hoppers want to come at them, they need to sit their ass down!

Park Ji-su, a professional basketball player and a well-known fan of BTS, was unanimously chosen as the youngest-ever league MVP after her team won the championship. This is the first championship win of her team's history. The team captain said, Ji-su said she got tickets for BTS concerts and asked to end the play-off in three games. Park added, ""The concert is on April 7 in Bangkok. Theres no guarantee that well win if the play-off goes onto the fifth game, and my schedule will become uncertain. So that was a strong motivation for me to win the third game."" When asked if it is winning the championship or successfully securing concert tickets that makes her happier, she chose winning the championship after a long pause.",15,257

About two weeks ago (yes, I know, just two weeks ago...), I got recommended Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears--which I have actually  heard and seen before as well as liked + downloaded-- and suddenly it was like something snapped within me and I was possessed. I started clicking on videos on top of videos, downloaded V live plus 40 of their songs, and followed them on all social media. I even started drafting a Jungkook fanfic (I'm REALLY obsessed with JK, like, I watched all of his fancams in a day). 

And now it's gotten to a point where I wake up and go to sleep watching them, easily dedicating at least 5 hours of my day to BTS and I'm a college student! I feel like I can't go without talking or thinking about them for 10 minutes, and I've been pretty demotivated to do anything else. I've noticed my appetite has gotten worse, I started feeling quite low lately whenever I'm not watching them, and I always get really upset (to the point of crying) when I think of how I will never know them since they are, you know, K-Pop idols. Even though I am aware that this is the K-Pop idol culture that the companies all promote, I just can't seem to get it in my head.

When I talk about this with my friends they all think it's ridiculous, ""how can you be depressed over a boy band?!"". I mean, hell, after writing all that I think I'm crazy. I just have no friends who listen to BTS so I have no idea what to do about this, and it's genuinely taking a toll on me where I find myself sleeping at 7am.

Do you guys have any advice? Or... anything at all?

Ending on a lighter note, I'm feeling super alone with my liking of BTS as well, do you guys have instagram or twitter or something so we can be friends and I can DM pictures/videos of them when I'm fangirling.... haha",70,83

We are looking for volunteers to create live show compilation threads for BTS' upcoming events! 

Since we have lots of new subscribers, the majority seem to not be aware that anyone can volunteer to make compilation threads a couple of hours before an event. This year we are making another post looking for volunteers since modding and looking for links at the same time can be stressful (we all have different timezones). 

Here are some examples:

- [Award Show](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/ag5n3f/190115_bts_seoul_music_awards_red_carpet_5pm_kst/)
- [Award Show](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/ap7wwo/190210_bts_the_61st_annual_grammy_awards_2pm_red/)
- [Music Show](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9br01j/180831_bts_kbs_music_bank_comeback_stage_5pm_kst/)
- [Talk show](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8qotzr/180612_bts_on_the_late_late_show_with_james/)
- **[More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/performancearchive#wiki_2019_performances)**

With the help of /u/playlisthoarder, there is a **[wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/liveperformances)** with instructions on how to properly format a compilation thread. It includes a **fully formatted template** with how your post should look, so all you need to do is copy paste, make the necessary changes and add the links.

Even though this is volunteer based, please commit to staying on top of updates and only sign-up if you are absolutely sure you will be around. Remember to: 

- Refer to BTS members by their stage names, as new and casual fans might not be used to their given names
- Make sure the format is easy to read for the community

Below is a sign-up for confirmed and probable upcoming events that will be broadcasted. Volunteers will be creating a text post a few hours before broadcast and update it with links and information as it is available. 

If you have questions or would like to help, please comment or send modmail!

I think this is a great idea, especially since we have done it before and it was such a nice thing to see from fan accounts! I read that this idea is being spread for this comeback specifically to help emphasize the message BTS has been crafting since the Love Yourself Era and most certainly will continue with the Map of the Soul series with Persona. I agree that this would be a great way to show BTS that we can try to remove our masks as well and when better to start with this next comeback? I wanted to make this post to help spread this idea more, especially to those of us on Reddit who also have a twitter account! Let me know your thoughts on this idea!",28,65

I was wondering if people have some not so common ones that we don't discuss much or remember?

I recently discovered [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9EeJetH8qM) and felt Jin was unnecessarily mean to Jungkook. Poor Jungkook gets so cut and refuses the wristband when Jin offers it, he also probably got more hurt because it happened on camera. 

Another funny time was in US when J-hope says his goal is to release his mixtape and Namjoon goes in english ""before you die right"". I don't think J-hope got the joke as he just nods and smiles but Jin got the joke and starts laughing.",146,70

1186,2019-3-26,2019,3,26,21,b5ovts,"If you could comfort any member from The Notes, who would it be?",EvieLuna,1553602020,"First of all before I say anything, this might have some (light) spoilers so if you havent read The Notes yet and dont want to know anything, try not to read this!

I finished reading The Notes last night and near the end of the book I was thinking about the fact that if this was real life, who would I feel most for and therefore, want to comfort?

I know the book isnt about that, but of course the topics discussed arent exactly made for light reading and throughout the whole thing I just wanted to comfort all of them, be a shoulder to cry on, a friend to turn to etc.  If you could choose one member to do that for, who would you choose and why?

I came to the conclusion that Id choose either Hobi or Yoongi. Hobi because throughout the book he was always the one to lift up the other members and put on a brave face for the sake of everyone else, even when he wasnt doing well himself  he was always the one to reach out first. Near the end of the book when he decided to turn his phone off and let everyone come to him first this time instead, I felt really sorry for him and just wanted to give him the biggest hug. I think we can all relate to understanding that the happiest people are often the saddest and the thought of Hoseok hurting so much when he was putting on a brave face for the other members and pushing his own feelings aside because he cared about the guys happiness more than his own, really broke my heart.

Yoongi because he was basically just a mess, he needed stability and reassurance and it was something no one could seem to give him, no matter how hard they tried. Even having someone like Jungkook looking up to him only seemed to do more harm than good because it just seemed to put more pressure on him  he couldnt shake the feeling that he was a failure and unworthy of life itself, and he didnt want to drag Jungkook down that path with him therefore all he could feel was guilt. I really felt for Yoongi and I think that out of everyone, he needed the most help. He was definitely in the worst way and if I could have helped or provided support to anyone, it would have been him.

Also, this isnt related but I just wanted to say I absolutely loved the relationship between Tae and Namjoon. Definitely one of my favourite parts of the book.",7,30

It also includes interviews with other Korean music critics and at least one fan translator.

As of today physical copies in English are also available to purchase at the following Korean retailers:
-Global Interpark: [Here](https://www.globalinterpark.com/detail/detail?prdNo=6448285884)

Note that Aladdin US is for US/Canada, not sure what the site is for Aladdin in other non-Korean countries.

I purchased from Aladdin (using chrome's translate feature made it easy to make an account and purchase) and am shipping to the PNW in the USA and it only came to about $30 USD total.

There's nothing to make me understand where does that love come from, she always tells me ""You wouldn't understand"". I even watched two of their movies with her, for her, made her polaroid photocards with them on, but still don't know why she acts the way she does.

i had NO IDEA the trailer (soon song) would hit me that hard. 

a little background as to why; 
Intro: Skool Luv Affair is one of my top 3 BTS songs. (that really says a lot, theyve got a lot of heaters) &amp; if you havent connected already, theyve got it mixed in the new song. 

ive also been following BTS since 2014, so i have a lot of history with them (too boring to explain), granted i wasnt following them as closely as i started to in 2016 because of .. reasons. (high school needed my attention)

but ANYWAYS ,what im trying to say is, wow. they really took me back. 

i didnt think id feel like this till 10 years from now &amp; id hear Answer: Love Yourself out of nowhere or something (LY tour was my first BTS concert, i have feelings for it). 

i definitely recommend listening to (if you havent already) Intro: Skool Luv Affair or even just watching the trailer for it, &amp; watching the Persona trailer afterwards, itll give you a semblance of the journey im sure RM was trying to convey he went through &amp; his feelings on it. 

because i sure did. i texted my husband as soon as i saw it, &amp; started gushing about how much i was feeling, considering it felt like i was standing face to face with my past self, &amp; thanking her &amp; understanding the solid fact that the past me &amp; the present me really are the same. 

the reason i am who i am, is because of my past me. RM made me realize this in one song. (like wth man) i dont know if its because ive had past history with them? or if i just understand what it is that theyre trying to convey.

whichever it is, im really here for it. 

personally, i think that when they said itll be a more organic album/sound this time, they maybe mean a mash up of their old sound &amp; their present sound? their sound from back then, kind of improved on &amp; polished with what theyve learned since then? 

regardless of the hodgepodge of feelings that are running through me at the moment, its still at face value, an AMAZING song. (you are welcome to feel otherwise, music preference is subjective) but its definitely going to be a fan attractor. a.k.a be ready for another influx of new fans (this isnt new really). 

the video was attractive, visuals were great, i can see if aging well as well (this is when you hear it again at a later date, its even better) &amp; as always, his delivery is perfect. 

my husband always says he swears he knows korean when RM raps, because you just really do understand him. (language is never a barrier when it comes to great artists) 

the song is a hit. 

so, yeah. im really stoked for the new album.

A. In the middle of the black board in the beginning, you can see three words written below the phrase ""Map of the Soul"". The three words are-

1. Persona 

2. Shadow  

3. Ego 

This means that the names of the next two albums could be ""Shadow"" and ""Ego"". 

B. You can also see the words  ""Dream"", ""Love"" and ""Happiness"" and the phrases ""Map of the Soul"" and ""Who am I?"" written all over the board. The words ""Dream"", ""Love"" and ""Happiness"" and the phrase ""Who am I?"" could be hinting towards the title of the upcoming albums. 

C. You can also see quotes by a man named Carl Jung. 

1. ""I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.""

2. ""A dream is a small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul, which opens to that primeval cosmic night that was soul long before there was the conscious ego."" 

There's a little bit of Korean written on the board, but I can't read Korean... So... The K-ARMYs are gonna have to help us out with this one.

Also, hip hop is not for everybody (so let's try to remain decent as different opinions are being shared). I want to know what your feelings are about this \~potential\~ return to their 2014 sound. Also, how do you think the general public (i.e. Western media) will react to this since they're mainly familiar with LY BTS?

&amp;#x200B;

I personally am ecstatic! I've only been an ARMY for a little over a year but my first exposure to BTS was with these two albums, and they got me hooked! I was born in the early 90's so this style of Rap and RnB is what I grew up listening to. I feel so removed from Western's rap genre now (my 14 year old brother is always trying to introduce me to these new rappers and I just can't...). So for me this is a win. I loved loved loved the Wings and LY era but a part of me was really missing their 2014 sound. I just thought they evolved from it and never considered that BTS would make their comeback a throwback.

[https://www.newsweek.com/bts-map-soul-persona-new-album-rm-namjoon-1377108](https://www.newsweek.com/bts-map-soul-persona-new-album-rm-namjoon-1377108)

BTS gave fans a sneak peek of new music on Wednesday in a trailer for their upcoming album *Map Of The Soul: Persona*,  and the focus has fallen on RMs reclamation of self. The extensive  trailer features a look inside a new song with RM, or Kim Nam-joon, in  the spotlight, exploring the idea of personal definition and the who am  I concept hes teased before. But what has fans excited is the But  Namjoon concept that has long been used to shame the K-pop star when  others step outside their expected boundaries.

The new song  features a line in Korean, translated to Three syllables of my name,  and the word but that should come before any of those, according to a  translation and screenshot posted by a variety of BTS fans on Twitter.

The  term But Namjoon was created using RMs own first name. The phrase is  one that K-pop community uses when one of their \[favorite artists\] do  something problematic and they want to redirect the attention to Kim  Namjoon, rapper and leader of BTS, and to justify their \[favorites\]  actions, according to Urban Dictionary. Through the phrase, the K-pop  star, and leader of BTS, has become a scapegoat for blame on all said  problematic issues in the K-pop community.

The phrase began when Namjoon was accused of a variety of  controversies, including plagiarizing lyrics from other rappers. He  addressed the accusations with apology in 2015. First, I would like to  sincerely apologize. Even though I am just at the start of my career, as  an artist I often feel the pain of creating something, he said, as  reported by Digital Music News. When I feel unable to write music out  of my own inspiration, I get my inspiration from talking to friends,  reading books I like, watching movies, interviews and letters from fans.  Whenever a line leaves an impression on me, I write the line down in my  memo.

The action of taking back but Namjoon in the series can  be compared to other artists using hateful speech against them to their  own creative advantage, like Taylor Swift turning the snake emoji into a  symbol for her own power, and a tour image staple. For RMs angle, its  reclaiming a phrase that has been used as a guilt or shame statement  again his past and showing the world who he really is now.

Fans of  the group praised RM for his creativity and strength in using the term  to his advantage. Namjoon reclaiming the but Namjoon card, wrote  **Twitter user @THICJ00N. This aint big d\*\*\* energy...this is colossal  schlong power.**

Others were glad he was aware of the phrase, as well as the support  from his fans. The fact that Namjoon even knows the phrase but  Namjoon means hes seen it before which means hes also seen all of us  coming to defense and decided to end it himself with one simple verse!!!  God Ill never get over this power move, wrote @myoonies.

*Map Of The Soul: Persona* is expected to be released on April 12. Its the first album released by BTS since *Love Yourself: Answer* in 2018.

*This article has been updated to reflect that Namjoon is RM's first name.*",30,135

1295,2019-3-28,2019,3,28,9,b6bxd2,"""But Namjoon"": A call upon the reclamation of power",Rhyethil,1553731921,"[The dreaded phrase.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=But%20Namjoon) Veteran ARMYs hate seeing it. New ARMYs hate to finding out about what it means.

Often used during arguments within online K-Pop platforms, the intent of phrases like ""But Namjoon"" or ""You stan Namjoon"" is to disrupt the focus of debate from another artist's controversial behaviour to any of Kim Namjoon's past mistakes. This crudely implies that no matter how ethically, morally or lawfully wrong a celebrity's actions are, none can compare in severity or notoriety to that made by RM of BTS.

Though over the years, the man in question has taken responsibility over his mistakes by acknowledging, apologizing and thoroughly re-educating himself to be more sensitive to each of these issues so that these mistakes may never happen again. Not all artists are as willing to admit their frailties; some have either denied allegations, made excuses or have downright ignored any criticism or evidence stacked against them, in hopes that the backlash they currently face will diminish over time.

Yet the public vehemence that drives the ""But Namjoon"" narrative remains as one of the few criticisms that have lived on to the present, in part due to how effective of a demoralizing insult it can be to BTS' fandom.

However, in this ongoing comeback, Kim Namjoon has decided to seize control of the same phrase that has once tormented him by clearly and fully acknowledging it through his lyrics. He is making a statement: the ""But Namjoon"" haunts him no longer for it is an aspect of who he is, his persona. He is now beyond the slings and arrows of the phrase; he is no longer ashamed.

Which brings me to the current point. Kim Namjoon has reclaimed the narrative as his own, on his own terms. I have no doubt that ARMY can do the same. What would be both the timely and most effective thing for ARMY to do is to campaign towards a takeover of the ""But Namjoon"" phrase on these same social media platforms, to redesign and repurpose it (\#ButNamjoon) with a narrative focused on the many good aspects or to be thankful of Kim Namjoon as the individual, the artist and the leader of BTS. Be it his leadership, his artistic talents, his personality, his quirks or even his visuals.

I shall reiterate this with distinct clarity: the intent of this campaign *is not* to pick a fight and/or belittle any other artist or fandom. Rather, we are to use it both as a tool to regain power over a word that has once hurt us, and as a rally of support to Kim Namjoon himself by showing that ARMY is ready to move on from the once-painful narrative with him.

In doing so, we not only adhere to our routine comeback goals on social media, but also add upon BTS' history and the history of ""But Namjoon."" So that in the future, anyone who has found themselves to enjoy BTS need not come to fear a phrase as have we, instead to embrace it as has Kim Namjoon.",38,203

But what the overall plot of the show seems to be according to one video I watched, the show starts off with the alien character Tata coming from outer space in a space ship and gathering up 6 characters from Earth to be apart of one of the greatest boybands ever. At least, that is what I have gotten from seeing some of the animated scenes with the BT21 characters. \^ \_\^

But if there is going to be a children's show ([according to this tweet! :D](https://twitter.com/doyou_bangtan/status/1111103841171210240)), if the show went into a different direction plot-wise a bit or a whole lot, what would you like the show to be about? What topics would you like to see the children and ARMY's watching the show as well learn about and cover? What world environment would like to see the characters interact with each other in?

1349,2019-3-29,2019,3,29,3,b6m9h5,Inspiration for the new Map of the Soul Series,Fleebledee,1553796992,"Since the comeback is rapidly approaching and hype is steadily growing, I want to shed some light on a few albums that likely inspired the new Map of the Soul series: 


**Epik High's *Map of the Human Soul (2003)*, *Remapping the Human Soul (2007)*, and Map the Soul (2009)**


The rapline consistently talks about how Epik High's music has been an inspiration to their music (Hip Hop Phile, VLives, etc.), and I don't think the title of the new series is a coincidence. I'm always curious about where my favorite artists get their musical inspiration from, so I wanted to share these albums in case there were some people in the fandom unfamiliar with Epik High's older stuff. Each of these albums are different from one another in terms of instrumentation and lyrical content. On the surface they'll seem similar to old school hip hop from the late 80s-90s; but, Epik High's music has a lot more melancholy and somber instrumentals than most American hip hop does. 


If you're a fan of hip hop I think you'll definitely enjoy these. If you aren't a huge hip hop fan but are still kinda curious, I'd recommend just trying **Map the Soul** since it's the shortest (~35 minutes) and is most targeted towards international fans. I'll put YouTube links to each right below, and I hope you guys enjoy!

*****

Some tips:

* Check back to the official reseller sites; they often add more tickets at a later time
* Prices fluctuate according to demand and typically fall on the day of the concert
* If you're selling, watermark your ticket (put your name/username/something all over it) before posting a picture of it on any social media. Otherwise it will be used to scam others
* Instead of paying hundreds/thousands for a scalped ticket and risk getting scammed, wait patiently and check local Facebook groups, Twitter accounts, this thread, etc. There are always fans who can't go or have extra tickets, and you'll have more chance getting one for a more reasonable price.
* whether you're buying here or on Twitter, check the person's posting/Twitter history. Be careful about buying from anyone who has only just set up their account, or who look like they've deleted most of their history. (/u/lost-property)
* **Soundcheck packages may require the ID of the buyer, making them non-transferrable.** DO NOT buy soundcheck tickets from third party sellers (sites or other fans) without contacting Ticketmaster and making sure the transfer is valid.

Pardon?",CalmRip,1553874192,"Ive been bothered by something ever since seeing BTSs Entertainmet Weekly interview. It strikes me as a wee bit hypocritical that BTS is willing to record in Japanese for that market (~$2.4 billion/year) but not in English when the U.S. market alone is $19.6 billion. Now, those *are* numbers for the entire market, not the pop segment alone, but obviously the U.S. market opportunity is on the order of ten times that of Japan.  Not sure what the rest of the English-speaking world lays out for music, but obviously its A Really Big Amount. So from the business viewpoint, it makes sense to consider making a market-specific product, AKA a song in English.

From the cultural viewpoint, frankly it seems a bit hypocritical on BTSs part to make Japan-specific songs and thumb their noses, so to speak, at English-speaking fans. If I didnt know that BTS are the adorkable, culturally awkward puppies that they are, I might even think this is a bit of racism.

So it seems like they could do something like do an all-English song on a U.S./British Commonwealth song that would up their chances of cracking the U.S. market and still maintain artistic integrity. Thoughts?",35,0

I'm guessing it's probably shipping out on the 12th but would be hype if they shipped out preemptively. 

Thanks everyone! ",3,1

BTS' contracts were supposed to expire in 2020, after 7 years of activity, due to legal requirements put in place after TVXQ sued SM for their 13 year long slave contract. However, Bangtan renewed their contracts in October of last year, extending their contracts another 7 years into 2027. What does this mean?

  
It means that the original plan was to end in 2020, which means the MOTS series would be the end of the BTS universe. (but obviously that's no longer true) 

&amp;#x200B;

In the Persona trailer, Namjoon has multiple costumes, which a bunch containing themes from past eras. At one point there's a school blazer(Boy in Luv). Another scene has him wearing a plain white shirt with a gold chain(N.O.). At one point a see a huge statue facing him, similar to Jin's themes in BS&amp;T. We see a bunch of other clothes, which could represent LY series(the clothing in that era is pretty varied, but are mostly just normal clothes), and this era. The graffitied classroom and the colorful puffer jacket could be from the TMBMIL era, but that's a bit of a stretch. Moving on:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/acrd9hut3cp21.png

This picture reflects the original plan for the BU, possibly ending with a reflection on the persona that BTS has created over the years. Map of the Soul: Persona will likely contain a reflection on these themes, as shown in the trailer. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: BTS' contracts were originally slated to end in 2020, making MOTS what was supposed to be the end of BTS. They renewed their contracts in October of 2018, however, so BTs and the BU will continue. However, MOTS will still be what it was likely meant to be. Namjoon, in the trailer is shown in a variety of scenes, all of which reflect a theme of each of the eras, which Persona is likely to cover. ",22,43

But I don't honestly think it's a good idea go completely back to their old hiphop style.  I don't think other artists do that either when they get worldwide famous. 

I think bts is so good when they have albums with many music genres to show their talent and their amazing MV and dance choreographies like blood sweat and tears and fake love. It would be a shame if all of this would go away in the new album. Like all the amazing singers wouldn't be able to show off their singing. I think they are gonna have influences and few hiphop songs on the new album, but I don't think it's likely to be only hiphop.  I think bighit knows it would be to big risk go completely back to the old era.",4,1
