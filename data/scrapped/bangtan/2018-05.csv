This is my first time buying a ticket for ANY concert ever, not just for kpop. Its nerve wrecking and the tickets for my area go on sale on May 5th!! 

So, I would like to know your experiences and tips on getting tickets or which seating area to pick, whoever has went to a concert before. What should I do to get the best seat? Should I buy the pit ticket? Im quite short (52). Do you feel as immersed in the mood when you sit in P2 or further away? How early should you get there to not have to wait in a long line and stuffs? And finally, any of you going to Fort Worth and wanna meet up? Im going alone so I want some companions to get hyped together !! ",2,1

I just had an interesting experience last week and thought I would both share and hear other people's experiences introducing BTS to others. 

I'm a medical student and last week I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to attend a heart transplant. Now this was my first time in the OR so I was pretty nervous, and even though my terrified expression was covered by a mask, my body language must have been screaming 'Holy cow don't touch anything, don't trip, don't faint, don't, etc.' One of the surgeons took pity on me cowering in the corner and asked me to pick the music for the surgery. Seeing that I was of East Asian descent, he suggested maybe I could introduce them to something non\-english. I internally panicked and almost told him no thank you, but decided I'd take this opportunity to promote the boys. I was super nervous though because music helps keep the surgeons in the zone and focused. Even though I knew they'd shut the music off during the most delicate parts of the surgery, I was worried \- what if something went wrong?!

I decided to play my mellow BTS playlist for studying, which includes songs like: House of Cards, Butterfly, I Need U urban mix, etc. 

They loved it! After the surgery, the surgeon asked me who the artist was and made me email him the list of songs. He was going to add some of them to his own surgery playlist. 

And thus, somewhere in the United States, BTS music is being played during heart transplants; saving hearts both figuratively and literally. ",47,257

Can we brainstorm some good questions that we can reply with? If many fans ask the same question, it's more likely that interviewers will choose it. Also please mention what interview your question suits best:

*RED CARPET interviews* **(5 mins max)**:  
- Questions should be short and simple  
- BTS will answer 100% in English  
- Interviews are unedited and often live  

*SEATED interviews* **(10-25 mins)**:  
- Questions can be longer and more complex  
- BTS might answer in Korean and might have a translator  
- Interviews are edited and not live",25,76

I went through the rules, and it seems that this thread might be breaking rules B.8 / B.9 but I'm desperate and hope you will understand.

One of the things I would like to prepare is some life size standup posters of Suga (her favourite member), but I've been struggling to find high resolution full body images. The closest I have found is 1,700x2,500 px and it looks pixelated when printed on a 100x180 cm board.
Could you please share or let me know where is that I could find this kind of pictures?

Thanks for your support!",8,35

MOST RECENTLY RELEASED NOTE:

JUNGKOOK

22 MAY YEAR 22

I thought my body was floating in the air but in no time I was on the hard floor. I couldn't feel anything for a while. My whole body just felt so unbearably heavy that I couldn't even lift my eyelids. I couldn't swallow my saliva, and I couldn't breathe. As my consciousness scattered, the surrounding became dimmer.

Then suddenly, as if I was startled by something, my whole body jolted spasmodically. Somewhere between pain and thirst I can't identify, I opened my eyes before I knew it. Over my prickly sight like it's filled full of sand, something glimmered. I thought it was light, but it was not. It was bright, big, and dim. It wasn't moving, and it was floating in the air. As I was looking at it for a while, it became to have a clear shape. It was the moon.

Maybe because my head was tilted backwards, the world was upside down. The moon was also hung upside down in that world. I tried to cough so that I could breathe, but I couldn't move. And then the coldness came to me. I was scared. I moved my lips, but nothing came out as words. My vision started to get darker and darker even though I didn't even close my eyes. As I was losing my consciousness, someone talked to me.

""To live will be more painful than to die, do you still want to live?""

	I have been doing a Senior Project based on K-Pop, with more emphasis on the boy bands Shinee and BTS, and I wanted to open the floor about your thoughts about the landscape of K-Pop fan culture and how we can lower tension and rivalries. I have learned through scholarly readings from Sun Jung and scholar Henry Jenkins about Meaningful Participation that fans have just a strong amount of power in the journey of the K-Pop idol as the record labels who manage them, and that the circumstances of BTS mainstream success and the unfortunate loss of Jonghyun can alter the landscape of how their respective fandoms will progress this year. 
	Because of the media attention of both idol groups, ARMY and Shawols have been organizing separate operations that focus on donating and providing relief to nonprofit organizations on behalf of their artists wishes and interests. With the comeback of both Idol Groups, and the bustling of fans preparing their light stick formations and fan chants, I would like to know:

	What is your honest stance of the K-Pop landscape as ARMY? Explain why you support them or just casually root for them?
	What elements/components of fan culture do you wish fandoms could improve on?
	Where do you see K-Pop and fan culture in the future?
	What are some recommended AMRY-organized projects/groups that should be given attention? (Aside from One in an ARMY)

An advanced thank you to whoever participates in this post and please spread this conversation around with the hashtag #HallyUDoesWell, so that K-pop fans can represent themselves as more than just a collective of music lovers with an expendable wallet.

They are releasing it on a Friday instead of Sunday or Monday. They are having their comeback stage at Billboard instead of a Korean music show. 

They probably expect LA fans to drop everything to attend whatever variety show they decide to appear on. 

BigHit has not tweeted a presale link to the album, only posting on the fancafe (and technically no one is supposed to share fan cafe contents).  For LY:Her they tweeted the link to Amazon and to their own website. 

One translator  [smentioned ](https://twitter.com/firstsight_jk/status/992064465024831488?s=21) yesterday that one KArmy felt that because of the huge number of international fans, BigHit should be providing translations instead of relying on free work of individuals. Its not as if they cant afford a translator now. 

They announced a tour, put tickets on sale a week later, and dont release even the album cover or tracklist. Very few artists (maybe Beyonce and thats it?) do that. 

This comeback comes off as slightly sloppy to me. The tour video was weak compared to the Wings one. The tour poster was a bad photoshop. Actual seating charts just came out two days ago. 

BigHit is resting on a lot of fandom power currently.  Do you think they are doing enough for the international fans? Are they relying too much on fans love for BTS to carry them? 

Note: this not a critique of BTS but rather their management company. ",177,39

I just figured this was really incredible and that anyone on this sub who isn't on twitter would like to know about it. Bad drama always has more reach than when the fandom comes together for good, so let's spread some positivity.

For those unaware, May 4th is Star Wars Day for many people (May the fourth be with you!) and in response Disney launched a [""Roar for Change"" campaign](http://ew.com/movies/2018/05/03/solo-star-wars-roar-for-change-chewbacca-challenge/). For every public tweet (including retweets) that had #RoarforChange in them, [Disney would donate one US dollar to UNICEF, up to one million tweets/dollars](https://twitter.com/Disney/status/992109314117484545). This was supposed to run until May 25th.

At about 1:30 PM EST today, a news anchor for ABC (ABC is a subset of Disney), George Pennacchio, [called upon ARMY to help support the hashtag](https://twitter.com/abc7george/status/992457177590677505) due to how well known the fandom is for trending hashtags. At about 4 PM EST [the hashtag started trending worldwide](https://i.imgur.com/psHaih7.png), filled mostly with ARMY tweets, and [it peaked at #1 wordwide](https://i.imgur.com/VOjjOHS.png). [In those four hours the 1 million tweet limit was broken,](https://twitter.com/abc7george/status/992525455210102784) meaning the maximum was hit well before the deadline. I saw a lot of people on my timeline supporting it as well as BTS, and as are partners UNICEF Korea/Japan, I think this speaks really well with their message. I'm not sure if we're going to get any news coverage of the event, but nonetheless, I don't think we need it.

First of all, just keep refreshing all official sellers every once in a while, because there are still chances (although, admitedly, very slim) that some will pop up throughout the day.  
But most importantly: anyone trying to resell their tickets now *bought them specifically to make money off people*, you won't find reasonable prices. It's not like you'll buy them off fans who unfortunately can't go anymore if they've been on sale for an hour, if you see someone selling tickets *already* there's a 100% chance they're scalpers. And the worst part is: if you buy it from a scalper, you're also risking wasting your money because of the chances of either getting scammed and being given a fake ticker, or of the tickets beign genuine but being cancelled because recognised as resold.  
Wait at least a few weeks, the closest to the date of the concert, the higher the chances of someone *actually* selling their tickets because they can't go anymore, and buying from a fan means higher chances of getting a decent price.  ",15,27

If youre like me and have no tickets do NOT give up till the concert date itself.

Most of you probably already know this, but, face book groups and searching twitter will be very helpful in your ticket chasing quest!

Tip:
Buy a lower tier ticket from the one you want since itll be easier to find, then trade up to the one you want since people are more comfortable with trading than selling.

It feels as if a vast majority of us were unable to get tickets to see BTS perform in Newark. And I, as well as other ARMY, feel that this is not just because the tickets were sold out in minutes, but because in those minutes the tickets were put up for resale for a price that was practically 10x that of the original. Think about it: a ticket that was supposed to be $60 was being resold at $300 right after it was purchased. Others were being sold into the $1,000+ ranges. 
In this moment of anger, I ask that we direct it to change this perceived injustice. To some of us, this appears to be legalized scalping. And just because something is legal does not make it right. And I know there are plenty of ARMY out there that dont think this is right or fair. 
The purpose of these tickets was to SEE BTS PERFORM and NOT RESELL THEM TO THOSE THAT WANT TO SEE BTS PERFORM. 
What I ask for us to do is this: come together as ONE ARMY. Spread the word and the hashtag above. Be angry about the ticket prices. Be angry about them being sold for an overpriced amount. Be angry that people who genuinely want to see them perform are being taken advantage of like this. If we gather enough attention, perhaps then we can truly change how reselling tickets are handled.
And please remember: be angry but also BE CIVIL. REMEMBER WE REPRESENT OUR BOYS.

We can't change what's happened, but we may beable to change how ticketing is handled in the future.

Spread the word, use hashtags such as #BTS #BTSWORLDTOUR #BTSLOVEYOURSELF #BTSARMY but remember to use #ARMYnotforResale.

We're trying to gain traction on twitter mostly. Retweet everything, do whatever you can. REMAIN CIVIL.

&amp;nbsp;

Spanish girls fell in love with the charms of K-pop group BTS.

It was reported that, at a music awards ceremony held in Madrid last month, BTS won two fan-voted awards. At the Hall of Stars Awards 2018, BTS won 'World category' and 'Spain category.' They are awarded based on fan votes from outside and inside of Spain, respectively. 

Regarding this, Big Hit Entertainment, BTS' agency, said on the 6th ""We're aware of the news that BTS was selected as the winner at the awards ceremony, but haven't been officially contacted by the show. The members of BTS were excited by the news although they didn't attend."" 

BTS' popularity in Spain was confirmed in KBS2 'Let Me Stay One Night' that was aired on the 1st. The casts asked girls they met in a street in Spain, ""do you know K-pop?"" They answered ""we like it."" When asked ""who? BTS?"", they screamed ""Yes"" as if they saw BTS. 

Kim Jong-min said ""I'm proud. I again realized how BTS' popularity."" This is an example showing how popular BTS is in Spain.

BTS, who's well known not only in the US but in the world, has not officially debuted or performed in Spain. However, Spanish ARMYs, completely in love with BTS, are requesting BTS to officially visit their country and sending 'love-calls' consistently via social media. 

While the locals are enthusiastic like this, it's a pity that BTS' world tour course that begins in September is missing Spain. BTS has arranged their schedule for four cities in four countries in Europe: London (England), Amsterdam (the Netherlands), Berlin (Germany), and Paris (France). They are in a situation where they cannot add Spain for now.

The agency said ""the stops for world tour are fixed/confirmed for this year, so we cannot make a change. However, we are willing to consider including Spain for next year's tour.""

BTS, starting from August in Seoul, begins their LOVE YOURSELF world tour. From September, 22 concerts in 11 cities will be head in the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. 

BTS successfully finished their Trilogy Episode, which began in 2014, last year, and is beginning their new tour: LOVE YOURSELF. 

Meanwhile, BTS, serving the title 'global group', will release their 3rd full album ""LOVE YOURSELF  Tear"" on the 18th and have their comeback stage in the US. 

BTS is nominated for the Top Social Artist Award at the 2018 BBMAs in Las Vegas on the 20th (local time) and is also invited as performers. The lead single of their new album will be premiered at the BBMAs. BTS will also appear on NBC's popular talk show 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show.'",35,126

I'm not sure of how much this is a theory, but I think it's more about the message that 'Love Yourself: Tear' is going to be about. I analyzed the lyrics and video \(Full thread [HERE](https://twitter.com/Nyvi_Grace/status/993183574688808960)\) and drew my inferences from there. Basically, what I think 'Singularity' and the new album means is that:

The theme is about not being true to yourself. A lot of people have discussed the ""fake love"" side of things and I don't think that ""fake love"" means affection from a lover that isn't real, but love for one's self that isn't real. Like, you're lying to yourself about ""loving yourself"" or that you're pretending to be someone you're not to please others. It's explained more in the thread, so I encourage you to read it.

As for an overall theory, this isn't exactly about the specific events that happened in the BTS story line/universe. But, it's my theory about the story. I love to get some feedback on it! \(Full thread [HERE](https://twitter.com/Nyvi_Grace/status/992105078801612800)\)",1,2

My class is from 3-5 pm and tickets go on sale at 4 pm tomorrow. Do you think I will be able to get tickets if I go to class and get home around 7 pm? I don't have any friends lol so I'm only buying a single ticket so do you think this will help my chances of securing a ticket? I've never been to any music concert in my life and I've heard the stories of how fast tickets sell out. I've been an ARMY since Danger era so I really don't wanna miss out on going to one of their concerts here. I do have wifi in class but it can be a bit iffy sometimes and I don't think it's safe for me to put in my credit card info in class using my university's wifi. Plus I don't think kpop is as popular here as it is in US as the new trailer they just released is only #40 on trending when I last checked compared to other countries which are much higher, but I guess this isn't the most accurate indicator of that.

257,2018-5-7,2018,5,7,12,8hkhtp,"Appreciation Thread for the Dancers Behind ""Singularity""!",OhYirum,1525662574,"Hi everyone! I'm not sure if this falls within the boundaries of this subreddit, but I really wanted to show some love for the dancers and choreographer behind ""Singularity"" as I hadn't seen it being done much elsewhere. I've been dancing on and off and following the dance community for a few years now, so to see a lot of familiar faces in this new teaser really got me excited, and I thought some other ARMY would enjoy learning more about them.

Keone Madrid:
Keone has actually choreographed a lot of BTS' stuff in the past - just off the top of my head, he's done Fire and Dope. He and his crew's style (Choreo Cookies) of fast footwork, crisp musicality and sharp angles has definitely bled into BTS' style over the years. Check out this video of his where he introduces a similar jacket concept as seen in singularity, though more playfully:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMa3xCwTvTk 

You can also see some of the ""Fire"" steps in his choreography to Happy by C2C (around the 0:42 mark) - that kind of sharp footwork is really characteristic of Keone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_bX0T76X8U

Bong Buno:

One of the back-dancers from this clip, Bong is sort of a rising star in the scene (as far as I can tell). I'm mostly familiar with him through The Young Lions (they were on the first season of NBC's World of Dance, led then by Ian Eastwood) but he's done a lot of work all around the scene.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrxMQtP0E9Y

Kevin van Nguyen:

A member of the same crew as Keone Madrid (Choreo Cookies), I'm less familiar with Kevin's portfolio but he and his wife have some incredible pieces together:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-BSMFtzDmM

Ade Willis:

I got introduced to Ade mostly through other dancers like Sorah Yang, Brian Puspos, Ian Eastwood - this guy is everywhere! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlBMx_me42U

Fabian Tucker Jr:
He's the dancer I'm least familiar with out of everyone in the teaser, but he is also a member of Choreo Cookies (Keone's crew). It seems for the most part he doesn't do as much choreographing as the other three dancers, but he has a really sensitive, subtle approach to movement:

290,2018-5-8,2018,5,8,5,8hqjvl,Do you think Jungkook will eventually get his own solo MV for Euphoria?,frankievsworld,1525723743,"This has been on my mind since Euphoria came out, and I saw lots of different opinions going around, so I thought I'd start a discussion! Some people are saying he'll get his own video later on, maybe for a repackage, while others are saying we're not getting anything else because Euphoria is tied to Wonder, and we're not going back to that phase of the story.

Personally, since it's Kookie's own song as much as Jimin's Serendipity and Tae's Singularity, I hope he'll get a solo MV at some point. I think it would be more neat and equal that way, like with the Wings short films. I know he's kind of the main character of the MV we got and I understand why Big Hit needed to include the whole group, but it's not really the same thing, is it?

(I also hope I don't come across as negative or as some kind of solo stan, that's far from the truth! I'm just curious about this sub's opinions since a lot them end up being right!)",81,5

305,2018-5-8,2018,5,8,10,8hswoz,"For anyone who was annoyed to only find overpriced ""platimum tickets"" on ticketmaster...",exitfromreality,1525743317,"TLDR: Platinum Tickets are simple regular tickets that Ticketmaster sell priced ""by demand"" They are not special, they are simply taking advantage fans and essentially scalping their own tickets. http://business.financialpost.com/technology/official-platinum-seats-how-ticketmaster-benefits-from-sky-high-tragically-hip-ticket-prices
  
Those aren't special, they aren't re-sale under a fancier name, those are tickets that ticketmaster has decided to sell for massively inflated prices. They are ""priced by demand"" and when people have inquired upon how many tickets ticketmaster has set aside to sell at these inflated prices, they have always declined to comment.  
  
Essentially, Ticketmaster's word on these tickets is that they are the ""best seats"" and were set aside by the venue or the artist for special reasons, but went unsold and are being offered to the public at this inflated price because they are essentially ""extra nice seats"", also, they may only be bought in pairs, so you have no chance to buy one at a time...even if they are GA Floor Here's where things get ugly.  
  
Upon trying for BTS tickets at Oakland Oracle Arena, at the exact second the timer counted down to zero I was presented with a list of Platinum only tickets. They were on average 500% higher than standard prices, and there were no standard tickets available. As I refreshed in order to hopefully find some regular priced tickets, the price of certain platinum tickets rose by about $100 over the course of half an hour.  
  
Due to platinum tickets being an ""unspecified number of tickets"" It's quite possible that ticketmaster is setting aside a majority of tickets for popular shows as ""platinum tickets"" knowing full well they will sell at that insane price, which essentially means most of us, who cannot afford $1200 for a P1 GA Floor ticket, are totally out of luck. Here is a screenshot of the current Platinum listing for GA Floor at Oracle Arena, it was $1200 about 45min ago, it has now climbed to $1900. Why? because numerous re-sale tickets sold at a price close to the $1200 Platinum price, and thus Ticketmaster raised the price of the Platinum tickets knowing they can get more for them.  
  
Also, this listing for Platinum Floor GA tickets has been there since the tickets became available 2 hours ago, they are still there, and have simple gone up in price starting at about $900 originally, and are now at $1900. What Ticketmaster is doing is selling off what might be a majority of Floor GA tickets 2 at a time at increasingly high prices. Although there is no way to know, It's entirely possible that only 10% of the Floor GA tickets were sold at face value, of $250, and all the rest are slowly being milked at higher and higher prices until they stop selling at those prices, and will at that point probably be listed slightly cheaper and cheaper until they are finally sold out, most likely all for WAY more than the listed $250.  
  
According to this article, yes, this is legal. http://business.financialpost.com/technology/official-platinum-seats-how-ticketmaster-benefits-from-sky-high-tragically-hip-ticket-prices Why are they doing it? because they have found a very small loophole to literally scalp their own tickets, and unlike scalpers, they have ALL the tickets to begin with, and can sell as many as they want as Platinum tickets as long as they feel they can get away with it.  
  
What can you do? Probably nothing, they have found a way to absolutely screw over fans like you who just want to see your favorites, and they will continue to do it as long as legally able to. Essentially, if you don't have $700-2000 to spend on concert tickets, of which I highly doubt BTS see's any of that markup profit, ticketmaster doesn't give a sh*t about you.  
  
So, as I will be doing, make AS BIG OF A STINK ABOUT THIS AS POSSIBLE. Tweet them, spread this around, tell your friends. Make it well knows how they are taking advantage of you.  
  
If you want, here is the corporate office for Live Nation, who own ticketmaster, Let them know what you think about them.

I heard Tickpick was a reliable re-seller, but has anyone actually ever used them to buy BTS Concert resale tickets?  If so, did you have any issues?  They said that they would deliver my tickets by mid-september, which is cutting it really close.

On Saturday my friends and I tried to buy tickets to one of the Newark shows. I had them in my cart, and I tried to change the shipping method to from 'will call' to 'mail' and lost them. Then yesterday we tried again for Chicago, and we got them. But powerhouse charged my friend twice.

Or so we thought.

Turns out, the Newark order went through. Even though powerhouse didn't give me a confirmation screen.

**So, check your bank account charges.** A lot of times purchases made on a weekend won't get posted until the following Monday or Tuesday. That's what happened to my friend. Both the Newark and Chicago charges didn't show up until the 7th, even though we paid for the Newark show on the 5th.

People might as well enjoy their freedom til comeback weekend lol. They will soon see the light... or sunshine, or worldwide handsome, list goes on. Id like to believe that we didnt choose to be army, army life chose us! 

To add, whos glad world tour tickets went on sale before the BBMAs? Im still contemplating why Big Hit chose to sell world tour tickets before their next comeback and album release. Its like they knew they can already sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide and didnt need more fans to fill seats.

Love Yourself: Her, both musically and aesthetically, was a very bright and colourful album. When you go back to September and look at those concept photos, it was very youthful.  The sun was setting on an exciting and crazy year for them. Even when you see photos of them post-promotions (like at the Unicef press conference for example) they still have colourful hair, but their roots are coming in... at that point I wondered, what do they have in store for us next!

So when they emerged with all dark hair, my first thought was ""lol they look like rookies"" because it was the first time we've seen them, all at once, with a more natural look. So today my thought is that it's more like they're resetting, re-calibrating, getting back to basics. Not sure if it's accurate to call this a new ""era"" as they're only part 2 into the Love Yourself concept, but this is how I am feeling today. I've been an ARMY for less than two years but the growth I've already seen is astounding, and they're nowhere near slowing down.",1,2

&amp;nbsp;

At the beginning of this year, BTS announced that they will no longer be accepting gifts and would like ARMY to think about ways they can put their time and money to better purpose. But even before that, the members of our subreddit expressed a *strong* desire to do more projects focused on charity and acts of service.

Thats why were very excited to announce the r/bangtan Fifth Anniversary Project: 

# [#ARMYMustServe](http://www.armymustserve.com/)
**From May 13 - June 13, 2018, celebrate BTS fifth anniversary by doing an act of charity or service.**

[](#RYAN_BOMB)

# I. How can I participate?

1. Do something good.
2. Take photos.
3. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdny3H1DcuD9BOSWsHC5Up_NGx1M9OsQiflfmVvSiB_hAAaFA/viewform).

&amp;nbsp;

Acts of service can be large or small, grand or cozy  anything that makes the world a better place. Here are our ideas for this year's MustServe:

1. **Volunteering**: Give your time to help a charitable organization.

If you don't know where to start, fear not! We've compiled [a masterlist of activity suggestions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2gk_qjeL_yDsOyBZ-ztGG7JQP_BQ_7EJNdTRSxvGaE/).

International shipping is available right away \(more expensive\), but if you don't mind waiting until July, I can ship once I'm back \(cheaper\).

Items that are crossed out have been sold. Only the items listed below are available. Payment will need to be done via PayPal.

Send me a PM if you're interested in anything; I can try to get you a shipping quote and I can also send you a link to pics of the items \(with your username written on a piece of paper next to them for verification\). Thank you!

Hey folks! Last comeback I made a bunch of printables to help people keep track of what was happening when in their respective time zones. Between then and now I learned the Ways of the Spreadsheet and figured that would be a much neater and more flexible way to do things.

 [**&gt; Here's the sheet!**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTspfQPTBfsaXCf0EWbuY9-RZZxSYiWz6bwh3Qj_jirz2QE6HL1jb8-s_1NToCXkZd42obuk3VQS_8a/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true)

I will be adding more events and times as they are announced. Currently I've converted KST to EST, PST, CST, and CEST. If you're in a different time zone you'd like to have added, let me know! (Also please do let me know if there are any mistakes.)

* completely changed their main kpop fandom to BTS
* still follow the previous fandom, but to much lesser extent \(BTS is #1 priority\)

The thing is that we kinda didn't experience the fandom change ourselves and that's why we wanted to know the reasons for the switch, what fandoms are usually involved, how much time has passed from being a casual fan to becoming an ARMY etc. Anyway, after we collect enough data and finish our theses for school \(3\+ weeks\), we'll make an analysis \(quantitative, if data would let us \+ qualitative\) with all the cool graphs and stuff. 

Analysis will be posted here but if you'd like, it could be also emailed individually!

**The moderators are in no way involved in this,** this is all our curiosity.

and 

""a hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence and other technologies have become so advanced that humanity undergoes a dramatic and irreversible change.""

I'm starting to wonder if this is intended to connect to DNA. In the music video we see a lot of references to physics and space and time, making me wonder if there is more to the song than I thought...

On my twitter timeline I'm continuously seeing some kpop fans accusing BTS of selling depression and/or calling them attention seekers while applauding other idols for always having happy songs and being always happy and innocent. Is being an idol means swallowing up your emotions and always putting on a happy facade? Is this healthy ?

I have nothing against people who prefer to listen to happy songs. Everyone has different preferences . But to hate on artists who have much more ""BAM here's reality "" kind of songs ? And also vice versa. I'm very uncomfortable with this sort of view towards artists. Is an artist really an artist if they don't pour their emotions into their art ?

I usually block such people but as the comeback comes closer, all these voices have been really loud. This sort of view really makes me realize how much people do not like to talk about mental issues .It leaves me frustrated. ",42,25

#I. New Theme

As those of you on desktop must've noticed, we just changed the subreddit's theme to match the new album coming out. I apologise for the delay, I got quite sick and didn't have energy for much.

For those of you on mobile, this is what the new theme looks like:

* [Day mode](https://i.imgur.com/KgYpg1V.jpg);
* [Night mode](https://i.imgur.com/YqXEcB9.jpg).

Reminder that you can check out all past themes in our [layout archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/layouts) in the wiki.

**Also, a tip for newbies:** You can go to the subreddit's frontpage by clicking on the ""TEAR"" logo in the header or by clicking the BTS image in the sidear. For reddit's frontpage, click on the ARMYBomb Snoo :\^)

#II. #ARMYMustServe

This is **BTS' 5th anniversary project organised by /u/BTSprojects**. 

At the beginning of this year, BTS announced that they will no longer be accepting gifts and would like ARMY to think about ways they can put their time and money to better purpose. But even before that, the members of our subreddit expressed a strong desire to do more projects focused on charity and acts of service. 

Thats why this project will be happening from **May 13 - June 13, 2018** by means of doing an act of charity or service.

You can get more about **\#ARMYMustServe [in this thread](https://en.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8ipqw5/fifth_anniversary_project_armymustserve/)**.

#III. \#ARMYMustServe: Postcards to kids

**/u/BTSprojects** is hosting an online postcard-making activity for **[#ARMYMustServe](https://en.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8ipqw5/fifth_anniversary_project_armymustserve/)**, r/bangtan's 5th BTS Anniversary Project. They are sending postcards to kids diagnosed with lifelong illnesses. **Submit your postcard designs to them online and they'll print + ship the cards!** 

A thread with more information will be posted later, but if you're interested, fill out the group participation form and join them at the link provided at the end.

It might sound simple, but we believe that even something as small as a postcard for these kids can make a difference.

Some background information about myself: 

Ive only been a fan for a few months now but I helplessly got hooked on their music and the members themselves. The moment I listened to their songs, I fell down the rabbit hole and dont plan on climbing back out anytime soon! This is going to be my first comeback with my (now) favorite group and their new album is coincidentally dropping on my birthday!! Because of this I was really contemplating on whether or not I should preorder their new album. 

And now the questions: 

For people who have ordered an album before, do you think its worth $20? I like the idea of getting a poster and some photo cards but what do you guys actually do with them? Dumb question but is there anything else you can do with the CD besides listen to it? Like am I able to download it onto my iPhone?

2nd Grade is definitely a better translation, and So 4 More annoyed me because it literally doesn't make any sense.  However, from a transliteration perspective 2nd Grade is still just ""okay"" and I think Sophomore would be even better.  The funny thing is, ""sophomore"" and ""so 4 more"" sound the same when spoken by a native Korean speaker, so that just makes me wonder if they were intentionally trying to be punny but just made people confused (or whoever was in charge of the name titling got it wrong in a weird way, I don't know).

I am a fairly new BTS fan. I discovered them late January. I was super excited about them from the start and wanted some merch. I found out about btsmania and thought I'd give them a try. 

I ordered this item: [https://btsmania.com/collections/army\-box/products/bts\-vip\-army\-box](https://btsmania.com/collections/army-box/products/bts-vip-army-box) 

The whole process was terrible. I ordered on 3/27/18 with paypal that's attached to my bank account. On 4/2 my payment cleared and I received an email from btsmania also confirming that my payment cleared and that they were shipping out my payment. The email stated that if I didn't receive a tracking number in 2\-4 days to email them. on 4/5 I emailed them asking for a tracking number. They replied: 

""

Hello, NatashaThanks for contacting us :\)As we have just talked with PayPal support, they mention that the transaction is under pending because you paid with E\-check.As a result, this will give your bank some times to process the transaction until the status is shown as paid. We have just sent your order yesterday and please do not worry, we will provide you with a tracking number as soon as we received it from our shipping courier. \^.\^We do not encourage our customer to pay with E\-check as it may take time to process the transaction, our suggestion is to use credit/debit card for making payment :\)We hope this clarifies, please contact us back if you need further helpBest regards,YohanBTSMANIA"" 

On 4/9 I responded that I didn't understand because I got verification that my payment approved and that it was no longer in my bank account. I asked for a shipping number again. 

They responded: 

""BTS MANIA \&lt;support@btsmania.com\&gt;Tue 4/10/2018, 12:44 AMYou;**

Hello, Natasha. We are really sorry to hear that you still have not received your package for your order and unable to track it because the payment was made via e\-check, therefore it may take sometimes until we receive the payment.We would like to inform you that we have shipped out your package 3 days ago. and we admit that we ship your package a little bit later due to massive orders we had. 

Could you please allow us another 2 \- 4 days to provide you with your tracking information? We are so sorry for postponing as we have no control over tracking number. :\(Please do not worry, we will send it to you right away as soon as we get your tracking number from our shipping courier.We hope for your understanding and patients. Please do not hesitate to contact us back if you need a further assistant. We will be more than happy to assist you \^.\^Please do not worry, we estimate your package should be arriving within another 10\-20 days.Best regards,BTSMANIA""

On 4/15 I responded that my payment cleared and asked for a tracking number yet again. They responded:

""BTS MANIA \&lt;support@btsmania.com\&gt;Tue 4/17/2018, 2:55 AMYou;**

Hello again, Natasha. We are really sorry to hear that you still have not received your package for your order and unable to track it.We would like to inform you that we have shipped out your package 10 days ago. The reason we sent out your package late is because the payment was via e\-check therefore it will take paypal some days to clear the payment and we can ship out your package. We promise this time to send you your tracking number by tomorrow's night.Please do not worry, we estimate your package should be arriving within another 8\-14 days.We sincerely hope for your patient and understanding. \^\^ Enjoy your day Best regards,BTSMANIA""

On 4/18 I received a text message stating that my package was shipped. The whole issue of my payment not being cleared was a lie. They were behind on orders. If they would have admitted that, that wouldn't have been a problem but I was panicking thinking that I had been scammed. I finally received my package on 4/26 \(I have text confirmations of this too\).  I took it home and opened it and there were nothing but problems. There were 4 items missing completely \(a 22 page book, a membership card, and 2 ""random gifts"" \-  all which are listed on the link to the item's page given above\) there is a damaged item \(one of the photo cards is torn\), and one of the 12 posters in a duplicate \(11 unique and 1 duplicate which I wasn't expecting. The other issue with the posters is that the signatures are random. They are not placed on the appropriate members. For example RM's signature is over Jimin and Jin's is over Yoongi etc. These issues wouldn't have been so much of a big deal if there weren't all the other problems. I immediately reached out to the company and asked them to send me the missing items. This was their response:

BTS MANIA \&lt;support@btsmania.com\&gt;Fri 4/27/2018, 3:39 AMYou;**

Hello, ARMYs.

Sorry for the long waiting for our reply as we are now spending time looking up for team to give you a better service soon.

We would like to announce that we will start a LIVE CHAT at BTS MANIA on May 1st, 2018, so you can ask any question whether it is regarding about your order or any other concerns, you can ask us \^.\^

Please stay tuned for more updates, meanwhile we will make sure that every order is shipped and in case if you have a problem with your order \(wrong order, missing order or package arrived broken\), we will make sure to answer you on May 1st.

We would like to thank you so much for your support and we promise to give you a better services as well as products really soon.

Regards,

BTSMANIAs TEAM""

I responded that I did not want to wait for the live chat system and that I just wanted the items that I paid for. I did not receive a response to that email. After May 1st came and went, I filed a dispute on paypal hoping that would cause them to take me more seriously. They ignored my dispute and I then upped my dispute to a claim. I received an email from paypal telling me to contact various authorities against the company. I wanted to give them 1 more shot to make it right since their website says ""100&amp;#37; guarantee satisfaction for your money back"" This is also a lie. I contacted them through the chat system not too long ago and the associate that I spoke to only would talk to me about the damaged item and not the missing item. I told them that, at this point that wasn't even the problem anymore and that I wanted a refund. They said that if I returned the package I'd get a refund. I was fine with this as I'm so frustrated with this company I don't even want the package anymore. They refused to pay for return shipping despite the situation and disconnected the chat service from me. The return shipping would be over $30 for so about 1/3 of what the original package costs. It's like I'm being penalized for their mistake again. At this point, I filed the claim with the authorities and paypal said that I should have a refund within 10 days. SAVE YOURSELF THE STRUGGLE!! 

I am willing to screenshot the email exchanges for anyone who wants more proof if you're thinking about buying from this company \(it's almost midnight at this point. I'm tired, cranky, and have to be up for work in about 7 hours\). I also believe that they only approve the 5 star ratings on their website as I put in a 1 star review with all of the issues that I've had and it is not approved LOL ",4,4

I have no idea why I was thinking about the YouTube Rewind specifically but I was thinking about how much new ground BTS has broken and continues to break this year. Haven't yet checked the revenue made by Burn the Stage on YouTube Red, but I'm going to guess it's been very well-received.

On top of that, BTS is actually going to *perform* at the BBMAs this year, and is making a second appearance on The Ellen Show. I'm still awestruck at the kind of recognition they're getting. 

I feel like YouTube Rewind is a showcase of viral content from that year created largely by independent YouTube users, not necessarily multi-million Korean entertainment labels and their internationally-acclaimed acts, but still, it's hard to argue that BTS hasn't made a pretty big splash on the YouTube trending/content list this year - especially given that the comeback hasn't happened yet - and we're not even halfway through. 

Idk what criteria are used for YouTube Rewind but some part of my daydreaming alter ego is smiling stupidly at the thought of these seven goofs being straight-up memes on YouTube's set and being forever remembered in what's become an annual commemorative tradition of Internet culture.",12,42

Music, style and even the way people talk and decide on what is generally popular. Non black people wanting to talk walk and dress/look and act black. I was thinking now that Kpop is slowly starting to become more and more mainstream with time, are we going to see more people want to emulate this style and be more ""Korean""/Kpop? More people wanting to go to Korea and learn to speak and act Korean? or more of Korean/Kpop culture/speech/dress/behavior be integrated into mainstream society? Just looking for thoughts and opinions. I personally think that we are seeing the beginning stages of this, but probably wont be as huge but I may very well be wrong. ",55,34

While you're here taking a break from watching the FAKE LOVE teaser on repeat, I thought it'd be nice to share lesser-known facts or simple comparisons between something from their debut-era years and now... to teach new ARMYs something they may not have known, or to put BTS's journey and growth in perspective for older ARMYs.

Anything works, but I'd especially love the kind that makes you stop for a second, and maybe even say ""wait... that can't be true."" (tbh I've been browsing Insta and I'm kind of tired of seeing the same BTS memes/clips/statistics pop up all the time so hopefully we can share some cool lesser-seen stuff? thought it'd be nice to have a light-hearted chat about this kind of thing)

593,2018-5-15,2018,5,15,10,8jhnno,My FAKE LOVE Theory,renk1737,1526347449,"Posted this on the main thread but I really wanted to get this out there.

Okay so......theory time. Apologies if some of my thoughts are scattered or random at times. THIS WILL BE LONG SO I RESPECT YOU IF YOU'RE WILLING TO READ IT ALL.

Based on the definition provided in the MV, the Magic Shop with that creepy dude makes me think of trading in negatives or sadness for something positive. We see each of the members giving in an item linked to sadness like Jimin's photograph from Lie and Jin's earpiece from Awake, in exchange for a positive item, in this case items linked to the girls from the Highlight Reels \(Yoongi's girl's lollipop, Hobi's girl's cake, Namjoon's girl's hairband, etc.\)

But here's the thing: I feel like Jungkook's item, a key, symbolizes that his girl...at least in this universe...has passed away and he is practically isolated, because it leads him to that room with this Grim Reaper figure. It's almost as if he's trying to sell his soul for her or give some sort of emotional pain from HYYH/Wings up in order to retrieve some form of happiness. One of the most interesting hints to me was the 6 coat racks, which mean to me one of two things:

1. The 6 coat racks represent the 6 other members \(aka Jungkook's hyungs\) have all given in to this creepy figure at some point after BS&amp;T, which was all about temptation \(I'm not sure how they ""gave in"" exactly, maybe a sell\-your\-soul sort of thing?\) and it's now the maknae's turn.
2. The 6 coat racks represent the 6 members that have NOT given in yet, and each time one gives in, a coat rack is gone.

The second option is quite interesting, because it begs the question: where is the 7th coat rack? Well I believe that if the second option is true, it is gone, because one member gave himself in to this devil figure before the rest. And who would that be? Kim Taehyung.

Think about it. Tae has this sort of evil influence throughout BS&amp;T, covering Jin's eyes like he's tempting him, featured in imagery of him as an evil fallen angel with wings. I believe that if the second option is true, Tae gave in to the figure due to the fear and trauma caused by the death of his father, and the loss of innocence that resulted after.

This is why we see Tae surrounded by masks and coat racks in Singularity, and all that dark imagery with him in black clothes and a mask of his own. It's as if we're looking into his psyche \(I feel that Serendipity did this for Jimin too\). Tae's storyline is one of the darkest in this universe, and all of this imagery and symbolism of him in the BU fits the idea that he's the first one to give in. And it seems from this comeback that Jungkook is next.

TL;DR My theory: Tae was the first one to give himself in to the devilish Grim Reaper thing at the end of the MV due to his father's death and his loss of innocence, and it seems that Jungkook's next in line. Each time one of them gives in, a coat rack is gone.",9,65

For me I'd say in terms of measurable success for Fake love to chart a bit better than Mic Drop in the US,  for the song to chart in Melon top 5 during non-zombie stream hours.

Now for me I'd say it would be good if this album could bring a new song I get addicted to and that I could comfortably place in my BTS top 5. Also I'd like if this comeback could shine a brighter light on Jin.

do the official light sticks change color during US concerts or only korean concerts? where can i buy from and know i will get a legit light stick, any chance i can find a couple used for a discount? what's the bottom-dollar price i can expect to pay for a legit one (hopefully not $30 like i'm seeing on amazon )?",38,51

A few months ago, I had posted [a discussion on how BTS' branding power is akin to the legend of the Midas Touch](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/84vl9e/the_bangtan_touch/?utm_source=reddit-android). At the end of my notes, I promised myself to work on a SWOT analysis of BTS (as BigHit Entertainment's primary SBU) and share it on here in the near future. With college done for the year, I'd like to follow up on that commitment.

The idea is that I take a look at BTS through a marketing/management lens and identify 1) the major internal strengths and weaknesses of the group, and 2) any external threats and opportunities that may have affected, is affecting or will be affecting BTS (mostly within a year's span, with long-term factors like their mandatory military services as exceptions to the rule).

I'll be taking a look at the following factors (but I'm certainly not limited to just these below):

-Each member's pre-debut careers/history,

-What each of them bring to the table in terms of producing content (their ""products"") and contributing to the OT7 team dynamic (leadership, conflict resolution, motivation, etc.)

-Their musicality, which involves ideas like their range of genres, meaningful lyrics and the formation of the BTS universe through their storytelling songs,

-The effects of them being involved in other products and collaborations such as Run BTS, BT21, Seoul's Tourism Department, LG, UNICEF, etc.,

-How BigHit and their staff support and manage them (marketing, maintenance, finance, etc.),

-Any shortcomings or weaknesses within the group and their company that may affect their growth,

-The overall work culture surrounding BTS, from Bang PD to their stylist noonas,

-How their organized, dedicated fandom- ARMY has played a hand on their successes in recent years,

-How BTS actively engages with ARMY through their content and social media

-How both traditional and online media recieve BTS, both within South Korean and international airwaves,

-How other companies (PUMA, Coca-Cola, Billboard) see BTS

-Potential groups/artists that are or would be competing with them for the K-Pop market share,

-BTS in the grander scheme of global music, involving them alongside other big-name artists of this generation,

-Reflecting on what's already been said about the group by other media outlets (""they make their own music,"" ""talk about social issues relevant to today's youth,"" etc.),

-Any miscellaneous factors that revolve around luck, pleasant coincidence, or ""being at the right place at the right time,""

Again, these aren't the only things I'll be reviewing as there are many, many more factors that make BTS a successful group, but I'll at least start with some of these.

This is where you guys come in. I'm a relatively new ARMY, only been one officially since September of last year. While I've kept up with almost all news about them religiously since then, I don't call myself an expert and understand that I've missed so much about them. I cannot do this alone and need your help.

If you know any legitimate articles, sources or references that I can use to study BTS from a marketer's perspective, from their fan engagement online to ""how J-Hope acts as the glue of the group,"" please send them my way. I do need to use more credible sources in an attempt to retain validity and my personal biases towards BTS so I can do this well. If also like to hear your opinions and insights about the BTS in this context. After all, I will be opening up the SWOT analysis for all of r/bangtan to review once it's done. I'd love to learn from all of you now and gather your input along the way. Thank you :)",24,63

Here is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. 

**Important Note:** If it's from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or don't have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    

---

#VI. SNS Mentions Megathread  

Here is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc. when this album drops!  

**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone like Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread. (Come through this time, B.)  

**Important Note II:** BTS' tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be *compiled into one self-post compilation* [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/).

--- 

#VII. TEAR - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread  

This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream TEAR (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. 

Well try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys' help to tell us since we don't know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  

This thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. **Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since it's ideally for more thoughtful discussion.**

#VIII. TEAR Comeback Mega-Guide 

This thread is already up, and can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8cwzvs/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/)! 

---

#IX. TEAR Compilation Redirect Gigathread  

The behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be **stickied** and contain links to *all* the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  

--- 

These threads are going to be manually posted by the mods, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated. 

There will also be a separate event thread for BBMAs as normal, where all the relevant content will be compiled.

If we notice any other one type of content flooding the sub, well jump in with another megathread when needed. As general advice: please remember that **compilations are always better than individual submissions** when it comes to a batch of similar content!

Its almost time to board [the hype train](https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png) again  hold hands with a friend and enjoy the ride!

Love,

The /r/bangtan Mod Team.

701,2018-5-17,2018,5,17,21,8k3wrk,I finally learned how to treat/love myself thanks to BTS,mechaemissary,1526560581,"Sorry if this doesnt belong here. Im just gushing 

I started my a job which was literally the most awful fucking experience I can possibly think of. I have been severely sick because of this job for 3 months (hence why Im writing this at 5:20 AM PST) and Ive lost like 25 pounds. I constantly cried at work because I was yelled at there and at home and I wasnt allowed to go to the bathroom or have a day off even when I was sick and Id get shamed for going to the doctor. It started a severe depressive episode where Id only lay in bed after getting off work late and only talk to my SO and listen to BTS or death metal. It was a full time job at a (basically) call center (I didnt take calls though, I did other office work, its complicated)

I never ever spent any of my paycheck on myself. I felt like it was unnecessary and I was being selfish. Id just spend it on food or on my family / SO / groceries 

And then that all changed last weekend when I went to LA and found two kpop stores. I was legitimately in heaven. Ive never even seen kpop merch in person (kpop fan since 2013-ish)
I blew over $90 on BTS merch/albums. Mostly stuff for my bias, RM ^^. I also bought my SOs niece (also an ARMY) some merch for her bias.

I havent bought new clothes in months. I havent bought shoes in years (outside of two pairs my SO gifted me ^^). My family and I live a extremely frugal lifestyle because were extremely broke. I never, ever treat myself and I always feel extremely guilty about spending anything on myself even if its essential. I also make shit pay (min wage) for shit hours (40hr week, no exceptions ever)

I just bought all of it because they make me happy and remind me I have some sort of worth. It still is making me happy to see all the pictures and albums I bought ^^

Consumerist. Dumb decision.
But god it felt good. 
It felt good to finally treat myself. 

Ever since I began listening to them last year Ive felt a lot more positive about myself and less depressed lmfao especially because of RM and Suga being so open about their depression / self-doubt / vocal hatred of the work world and extreme education goals. It helps a lot to just pop on Reflection or 2! 3! after a long day at work and just unwind 


I also preordered LY:T this morning (!) because I just got my last paycheck. I spent the extra money ensuring itd be here tomorrow instead of the 23rd (stupid). I just love these damn kids too much for my own good.

nbsp;

BTS sincerely laid out their thoughts and stories in this album as well.

'Airplane pt.2', which is an extension of 'Airplane' from J-Hope's mixtape, contains honest emotions that the members had while traveling all over the world on their world tour. 

In 'Anpanman,' they compare themselves to Anpanman, the world's weakest hero, and tell their wish to deliver hopeful energy via their music and performance.

The album also includes 'Magic Shop,' a fan song produced by Jungkook, 'Love Maze,' a song contains their wish not to miss each other with ARMY, who are sending their constant love to BTS, in a maze, and 'Paradise,' a song written based on Suga's new year's greetings message ""it's okay even if you don't have a dream.""

In addition, 'The Truth Untold (feat. Steve Aoki),' a unit song of Jin, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, '134340,' which is characterized with a signature analogue sound of BTS, 'So What,' an EDM track that induces listeners to internally dance, and 'Singularity,' a sont showcasing the attractiveness of V's vocal are included.

'Outro : Tear,' ending the album, is a hip hop track that is made by sampling the main theme music of LOVE YOURSELF Highlight Reel . The powerful rappung of RM, Suga, and J-Hope stands out.

739,2018-5-18,2018,5,18,8,8k8p8a,Twas The Night Before Comeback: another poem,Caledonia_Plaid,1526599295,"Twas the night before comeback, when all round the world,  
the ARMYs were stirring, prepared to be hurled,  
full speed at events we could not have foreseen,  
when Bangtan debuted back in twenty-thirteen.  
From humble beginnings and being ignored,  
to premiering a title track live at Billboard!  
And I at my desk, try to put into rhyme,  
the feelings we have in this wonderful time.  

  
Flashback to awards shows a few months before,  
where hidden in stages were parts of the lore,  
Those eagle eyed ARMYs who spotted the signs,  
Examined each frame and translated the lines,  
dissecting the clues, coming up with the theories,  
that Love Yourself: Tear would be next in the series.  
Then after came something we all know too well,  
the time before comeback: the content drought hell!  

  
For months we were waiting, we tried not to stress,  
At least every Tuesday had Run, BTS!  
Japan promos led by Hoseok and Jimin,  
provided some respite in the interim,  
And then Burn the Stage, where we witnessed in awe,  
The hard work and struggles, emotions were raw.  
Then what should appear, but a sight oh so rare,  
an MV where all of our boys had dark hair!  

  
Euphoria came and it had us all shook,  
with dazzling vocals from solo Jungkook.  
The boys looked so happy, the song was a bop,  
we anxiously waited for more things to drop,  
The tour was announced and we vied for a spot,  
some of us got one, some sadly did not,  
Before the depression could even sink in,  
The comeback for Tear was about to begin...  

  
In all of his glory, Taehyung, there he stood,  
the one man who could make a mullet look good,  
He danced and he crooned, and he really looked fine,  
and bonus: officially part of dance line!  
Along came the photos, the concept was dark  
and no one could breathe when they saw Jimin Park!  
They all looked so good, OT7 we stan!  
All hail the coming of emo Bangtan!  

  
The subreddit headcount has grown by the score,  
The mods keep it organized, fun, and whats more,  
They make this a place where all ARMYs can come,  
Regardless of age or what country their from. Signed in, at the ready, subscribers they wait,  
For some its quite early, for others quite late,  
But no matter what, 6pmKST,  
is finally time for a brand new MV.  

  
Well buy all the albums, and stream once again,  
The single will make it to Billboard top 10.  
Whatever our boys want, they need only ask,  
For ARMYs are certainly up to the task,  
Well soon have them charting on Gaon and Melon,  
American muggles will watch them on Ellen,  
Ask Anything Chat will have questions a-plenty,  
With ten second clips dragged out til twenty-twenty!  

  
The content will flow, and well all be well fed,  
Well stay up to watch as our eyes become red.  
We know in our hearts, during all the above,  
With Bangtan and ARMY its never fake love,  
And so as the hour of comeback draws near,  
Lets all get together and let out a cheer!  
Hang on for the ride, heres the last thing Im writing:  
Happy comeback to all, and to BTS: Fighting!  

  

  

Note: I felt inspired again. Love and good luck to us all for this comeback! I hope you all have an amazing time and I cant wait to share it with everyone on r/Bangtan. :)

Interviews have already started dropping. During press junkets, BTS gets asked questions that range from inane (celeb crush) to insightful and somehow manage to get through it all with grace. 

**How would *you* answer their interview questions?**

I'll post questions from their interviews as top level comments, rephrased a bit so they're posed to you, instead of BTS. Answer as yourself! Your answer can be serious, silly, or anything that doesn't violate the rules.

If a new interview question comes out that you'd like to try your hand at replying to, please add it!

Reliable sources include articles, tweets (from a reputable Twitter, of course), or screenshots.  This makes it easier for me to keep this megathread up-to-date because I can't add anything until I verify it myself.

803,2018-5-18,2018,5,18,19,8kc82y,Here's my theory:,antiheroatbest,1526640354,"I think the lies are starting to slip through the cracks whether Jin likes it or not. Smeraldo, the fake flower Jin so furiously protects, turns into sand, and after that happens Jungkook is able to see an escape route from the Magic Shop and all those fears start manifesting in the most violent ways they can.

So heres what I think happened in a timeline of all the videos:

-HYYH and everyone dies

-BST/WINGS, Jin makes a deal with the devil to bring them all back from death, the trailers are their emotional perspective of the bad timelines

-FL Teaser 1: Everyone exchanges their fear for the highlight reel, and thats when JK and TH learn the truth (Singularity comes somewhere before this)

-Highlight Reel: ALL OF IT IS ONE GIANT LIE. ALL OF IT.

-Euphoria: Still a pretty lie Jin wants to believe (and Jimin), but Tae can see right through it in the ending.

-Fake Love: The fear they exchanged starts to break free and Jin's fixes are breaking. Jungkook escapes the Magic Shop.

So, did I miss something? What do you think? Is there something we can add?

855,2018-5-19,2018,5,19,3,8kfeh0,Anpanman has some interesting numerology,yoongles93,1526668240,"ok so i know that the song is probably inspired by the tv show, but Anpanman is also an asteroid: asteroid 46737 to be specific. 

the song is track 9, which is already interesting to me because 4+6+7+3+7 = 27 (2+7 = 9)

so the asteroid number adds up to the track number, but ALSO the numerology symbolism of the number 9 is all about the themes of the lyrics in the song. some of the lyrics include whos gonna do it if it isnt me?, im a new generation and i believe in myself because im a hero

some of the things the number 9 symbolizes are service to humanity, leading a positive example, inner strength and wisdom, high ideals, responsibility, self-love, and leadership. i think its really interesting that track 9 is all about being a hero and wanting to be a better person in order to make the world a better place, so i thought i would share. 

also.. the album is SO GOOD AAAAH",1,1

927,2018-5-19,2018,5,19,20,8kklrv,An appreciation post for ARMYs,sayuriM,1526728182,"I'm feeling so overwhelmed right now. I stayed up all night and streamed then fell asleep. Woke up to see our views and I feel so proud ! We worked hard together . Thank you for all the hard work everyone . This is the most fun I ever had with streaming ! Just one day after the album dropped and we are already breaking records . I'm so proud of us . Even K-ARMY are happily breaking records in K-sites and it makes me so damn proud ! And we even got a new nickname from western stans ! Add "" sushi stans "" to our list of nicknames !
People might call us view obsessed , numbers obsessed and that we don't appreciate the music . Don't listen to them , they want to see what they want to . Unfortunately for a lot of armys , the only way we can show our love to BTS is through these numbers . Not all of us can buy their products everytime. Not all of us can buy the albums or the BT21 products or the concert videos or go to their concerts. Breaking records in the name of BTS , its the only way a lot of us have . To promote BTS and to spread their message . People have different ways to showing love, a lot of armys chose to show love through breaking records. Its fun actually. We all had fun while simultaneously bopping to the ( ducking brilliant ) album. Sometimes it gets stressful and we doubt ourselves . Its almost surprising how little we think of our fandom ! None of us thought we could actually reach 40 Million views and come so close to breaking Taylor's record ( and we just might ! Let's wait for YT to recount the views ! Let's have hope ). 
And it's not thankless either lol . The amount of love BTS gives us , its almost overwhelming at times. I think everyone of us wishes that we could go to BTS and directly tell them how much their music has helped us in life. 
Anyways , let's have a fandom hug everyone . Thank you for being my other family.  Have a good rest !",3,11

Admits all the excitment, I just realized that their upcoming performance will accomplish many feats by not only becoming the first Korean act (let alone K-Pop) act to premiere their new song at an American awards show, but also giving significant (and positive!) exposure of Asians in general. And coincidently (or is this all not a coincidence?), this month is also Asian American/Pacific Islander History Month, which makes this upcoming performance even more of a landmark event for positive Asian representation.

And so, r/bangtan, how do you feel seeing BTS becoming leaders of Asian representation in America at this moment? Did you have any preconceived notions about Asians or Kpop before becoming an ARMY? Feel free to share your thoughts, I would love to read them! 

And finally, I just cant help but feel emotional already because this upcoming performance is already so meaningful to me as an Asian American who rarely saw a non-stereotypical Asian figure in American media during my younger years.",33,127

Other people have a natural liking for it. One of the aspects that truly makes me love BTS is the embodiment of those questions and thoughts that we ruminate on, since it's something that people often do strictly within themselves. I've found a lot of Namjoon's and Suga's words playing big parts in the 'discussion' that goes on within myself, and this really helps in figuring and understanding yourself. 

Recently a friend of mine has suffered a breakup, I wanted suggestions on what songs do you think would help in soothing and aiding the internal thoughts she might be exhibiting.",10,37

I live in India so I will have to get up at 5:30 am to watch it live and will have to get up even earlier if I want to watch the red carpet, will decide on that later. I have also arranged a platter of snacks, especially a couple of bars of snickers  
 
Seeing the amazing snippet of the choreo in the mv, I just cannot imagine how much better the whole performance will feel and shook the audience will be. If some of the celebs were impressed by the amas performance I can just imagine how impressed they will be with this performance. I have even attempted to learn the fanchants even though I will be watching it alone in my house  but I am happy enough that I will have my Reddit army keeping me company.

I could write 10 more paragraphs on how excited I am, but I don't want to bore y'all.
And sorry in advance for my grammatical mistakes and lack of coherence as I am excited beyond words.",114,117

I'm going to the *O2* arena in London. At first, I wanted to try to get the GA tickets, standing with the crowd. But after reading many bad experiences, I'm not so sure now. Important stuff:

* I will be going alone.
* I am 168 cm \(5 ft 6 in\)
* I can't arrive there super early. I will be flying from another country, so I could get there maybe 5\-4 hours before the concert starts.

Sooo, is it a good idea? Assuming I can't go to closer rows, is the view still good from the back?

The prices for the first level seated are the same, and I think those are great too: [map of the arena](https://i.imgur.com/PbtDfj7.png)

- the red carpet

- the performance

In terms of the performance, I really hope they go with the glittery jacket looks in the fake love MV as opposed to the hoodies/distressed denim look they have in some of the other shots. I have no idea which one they'll choose or if it will be slightly different tbh. 

For the red carpet for BBMAS 2017 and AMA 2017 they wore mostly standard, black outfits by Saint Laurent so I kind of predict it will be similar tonight, but a small part of me hopes it will be something more like the stuff they wore to all those award shows in 2016 AKA BST era royalty fashion lol.

Simply fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebwJA4tQRe48QKYa61zceeUjoUvL9gWKP3dtgFlBx7E2uq4A/viewform) and donate some of your time to contribute to our challenging goal of reaching Top 10 on the Hot 100.

Although Fake Love climbed 3 spots to #26 on the U.S. Top 200 Spotify charts today [streams actually dipped a bit](https://twitter.com/bts_geek_stats/status/998265933104852993). At our current pace, [weekly streams will still be weak](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Da6ylxJU0AA-tVX.jpg) compared to mainstream artists. YouTube views are also unreliable, as we saw from the deleted views. We can't rely on radio play since only two stations (103.7 KISS FM and KJ103) have Fake Love on regular rotation. And even though we dominate requests every hour, Most Requested Live was only willing to give us [one play](https://twitter.com/MostRequestLive/status/998036226572627968) yesterday.

So we need to boost sales of the title track. Competitors for Hot 100 consistently sell well across different digital platforms, but we tend to focus on iTunes only. Fake Love has been blocked from #1 on iTunes by Kris Wu's single Like That (though there's definitely bots or VPNs involved). It hasn't shown up on [Amazon's Best-selling Songs chart](https://twitter.com/BTSonHot100/status/997960912354074624). And it hasn't shown up on [Google Play's Today's Top Tunes chart](https://twitter.com/BTSonHot100/status/998027170357313536).

Nielsen collects data from ~14k sources, and BTS' music is only available on [seven of them](https://twitter.com/BTSonHot100/status/986473143370964992). We need to sell strong on all of these platforms to achieve an estimated 150,000 sales for a chance at top 10 of Hot 100. So if you don't have the money, please donate some of your time before the tracking week ends to help BTS debut as high as possible on Hot 100. Thank you!",14,149

There were so many ARMY there tonight, like I was honestly shocked at how many ARMY Bombs I saw walking into the venue. Im so proud at how far bangtan has come in just one year. 

So before we went into the seating area, my friend and I were just chilling by the concessions stand. Guess who I saw again. SEUNG DUK! I was honestly so shocked to see him walk by me, because this is the second ive seen him at American awards shows. Im telling yall, its a sign for me to take dance lessons. 

Fast forward to seating, again there were so many ARMYs in the nosebleeds. Though i will say I feel like I had a clearer view than at the AMAs. When the boys walked in the producer was giving us instructions on what was going to happen so there werent too many screams. But what we missed from them walking in, we sure made up for in cheering at the commercial breaks. Every so often one of the members would turn around and wave at us, and of course more screaming ensued. I laughed because at one point they showed the boys on the screen, and of course the audience went apeshit, and Jimin looked super confused because there was a bunch of screaming and I dont think he knew the camera was on them 

Its cute to watch them jam out to the other artists. I feel like i could just watch them watch other performances and I would be totally satisfied haha. It was harder to see them in the crowd though because of their dark hair. At the AMAs is was easier to pick them out because they had the crazy colors. 

I am super sad that I didnt really catch their acceptance speech for Top Social Artist. The screams were just way too loud. But im super proud of Jimin for speaking in english! I have yet to watch the acceptance speech, so im still not sure what they said

After they accepted the award, they went to the back area and didnt come back until the performance. 

Guys. Fake Love is seriously no joke. Its such a powerful performance, like i dont even know how im still alive right now. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THOSE HARNESSES!!!!! I missed JJK showing his abs because all of my attention was on Namjoon haha. When it ended I asked the girl next to me if he flashed his abs and she looked at me like i was crazy  

And I just gotta say how impressed I am by Mr. Park Jimin. His vocals have improved SO MUCH! Its so amazing to see his progression as a performer

Because i didnt really remember much of the AMAs performance, I really wanted to soak this one in, but I dont think I was as successful as I wanted to be. Im just super happy that Im going to be seeing them in September, because Fake Love is DEFINITELY something I need to experience life again. 

After we left the venue, my friend and I were heading to the monorail to go back to our hotel, and low and behold here comes Seungduk AGAIN! I wanted to say hi, but I chickened our because I didnt want to bug him. 

Anyway, its always such a pleasure to see BTS perform. I wish I could see them every day hahaha! If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Im sure that ill bee at the next American awards show performance, because Im WHIPPED. Now please excuse me while I go cry over fansite pics and listen to Tear.  ",36,183

I've been a fan since boy in luv but never really paid attention to fan engagement until maybe around dope when I started to see ARMY get called annoying for being everywhere, so it got me curious whether it's always been like that, or what spurred this? I know kpop fandom is pretty intense but ARMY can be pretty next level with it. If someone who has been following for a long time knows I would love hear how it started or if it's just happen to always be this way with BTS. ",20,84

I have to say I wasnt a massive fan of the Mic Drop Remix. Theyve used English in their lyrics in the past and Ive been a fan, however I was still a wee bit skeptical about how they might use English in their new album going forward from having visited the USA and their World Tour. Oh my god. I neednt have worried, they have managed to perfectly balance the use of English and Korean in this album to the point that I couldnt actually tell what language I was hearing because it was just making me feel emotions that I couldnt explain out loud. So anyway, just wondering what other peoples opinions on English in the new album are?

Stand out use of English for me has to be on The Truth Untold. Cant. Stop. Listening.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J48NGPOD2Fc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKAK0VFkMgA

I remember reading a Twitter thread about Spring Day's choreography and how it related to the theories of the song being connected to the Sewol Ferry tragedy and it blew me away. I was hoping we could discuss Fake Love too :)

Here's some of my thoughts (in chronological order as the choreography plays):
* The domino effect at the beginning with the boys falling in line behind Tae who seems in control 
* [JK separates himself from the group](https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=14s), falls and Tae puts the weight of him on his back as he pulls him up - *the mask of fake love forcing us to play along/only real love can help us up* (^or ^if ^we're ^going ^in ^the ^Bangtan ^Universe - ^hinting ^at ^the ^theory ^that ^Tae ^is ^responsible ^for ^JK's ^fate - ^quoting ^The ^Notes: ^""Living ^will ^be ^more ^painful ^than ^dying, ^so ^do ^you ^want ^to ^live?"")
* Joon mentioned in many interviews that the choreography includes the phrase 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' which we can see in the chorus section of the song. 
According to Wiki there are differing meanings of the phrase:
1) about not dwelling on evil thoughts (which suits the narrative of Fake Love - having these evil thoughts and lack of love for yourself)
2) used to refer to a lack of moral responsibility when 'looking the other way' - could refer to the mask discussed in the lyrics, and avoiding the truth for so long of having your love being fake 
* JK joins Joon for his solo dance, and they have a moment where they [mirror each other](https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=47s), and then again with Hobi [here](https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=1m) - *similar to the MV when he watches on his hyungs in their various rooms*
* Jimin [controls](https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=1m4s) the members like a puppet master - *'For you I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad' putting on an act, being controlled by fake love*
* [OT7 pushing their hands](https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=1m24s) and then pulling back - *Their hands: 'I grew a flower that can't be bloomed'*
* OT7 [hanging their arms limply](https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=1m28s) as if held up by a string - *ahem puppet analogy*
* The immediate part following that is them releasing themselves from the harness - *shedding this facade*
* Suga [goes down the line]( https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=2m18s) affecting each member he passes  *a ripple effect of your actions/destroying versions of yourself through fake love/fake love leads to inevitable deterioration?/^Bangtan ^Universe: ^each ^of ^the ^members ^fates ^are ^connected*
* [Jimin &amp; Tae walking towards each other]( https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=3m35s) - *real version and the fake love version of yourself facing off*
* [JK &amp; Jin]( https://youtu.be/J48NGPOD2Fc?t=3m54s) connecting their hands with the members huddling around - *connecting as a flower, which becomes unbloomed when JKs hand falls. Fake love reigns*

The Bangtan Universe ideas for the choreography relies on [this](https://twitter.com/ilsansqueen/status/997430489727188992?s=12) amazing MV theory. 

What others stories or hidden meanings did you see in BTS's choreography for Fake Love? Any alternate ideas to the ones I picked out? And what were your favorite moments in the choreos? (^ahem ^JK's ^ab ^flash)",24,161

Maybe they were kind messages to Army, or banter between the boys, or pictures/videos that they've shared? Show me your favourites!",67,217

I sadly need some assistance. Im really trying to purchase from Amazon but a lot of the products have bad reviews, and a lot of the comments are saying theyre fake. Just hoping I dont purchase the wrong one. So I wanted to know where I could purchase the album and everything with it, like the photobook, photocard, etc. 

I know this is the real deal; https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07BZBBVLF/ref=tmm_acd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526924903&amp;sr=8-2

These are all changes in the right direction, and it's got me thinking.

What is the possibility that the BBMAs will nominate more than one K-Pop group for Top Social Artist? What must these potential prospects (and their respective fandoms) achieve in order to be nominated, when BTS and ARMY have raised the bar unrealistically high with 94% of the vote? How will this affect the image of Billboard as an organization? The Western GP's perception of Asians? Intergroup relations between ARMY and other fandoms? And between BTS and other nominated groups? Will the TSA award turn into the Best K-Pop Group in 3-4 years' time?

What are your thoughts on the subject?",42,32

On the first playthrough of Tear, my favorite song on the album was Anpanman. It was catchy, fun, fetty Tae is hilarious, J-Hope goeesss, but like something about this song in particular felt very familiar. Like this song connected with me in a weird way. Then it all made sense when I was driving this morning, and ""Attack on Bangtan"" played on my shuffle. Then it prompted me to listen to old Bangtan, and then suddenly Anpanman suddenly became a different song than just a song about being a superhero and being afraid to fail people:

Anpanman feels like a graduated/""new generation"" Attack on Bangtan and Fun Boyz, reminiscent of their old time hip hop identity, and it reminds me that they're still the Bangtan they started as.

The boys were due for a new self-referential hype song like Attack and Boyz, and I can't even. And this is a double meaning as well which I love. Obviously they're ""still Bangtan"" even though they're more popular, but this song really made me see the evolution of their hip hop sound in Tear. Although Bangtan has talked about a change in sound and trying out different genres, oddly enough a listen-through of Tear the sound feels the most like 2Kool4Skool-Dark&amp;Wild aged like a fine wine. Like, it's incredible when you pay attention to the instrumentals of Tear how much subtlety/old nods there are.

1166,2018-5-22,2018,5,22,5,8l3ttp,What are your favorite musical details from the new album?,strahberry,1526933127," As I've been spending some quality time with each track and falling deeper in love with them, I've definitely noticed new details with each listen. It's these details that have made my admiration grow to the point where I officially love every song on this album. None of them qualify as a ""skip"" for me \(which is quite rare for me, personally\). What are some little things you noticed that made your heart and ears go UwU or O.O or even TT?

Ps. You don't have to have musical knowledge or know the lingo to discuss \(I'm still a novice with theory myself\). Feel free to just explain what you hear as best you can :\) 

\_\_\_

below are some of mine from a few tracks: 

**Singularity** \- the dynamics of the chorus, starting @[ 0:55](https://youtu.be/p8npDG2ulKQ?t=63). That sudden crescendo at \~1:06 \(\~0:57 on the track itself and not the MV\), followed by his voice going essentially mute during the """" in "" "" \(the ""bu"" in ""eoleobuteun""\). Those sequential crescendos and decrescendos make the chorus feel like waves on a lake shore. 

**The Truth Untold** \- The flawless, even vibrato Jimin has[ @1:04](https://youtu.be/pKbWGhV0QbE?t=64) \(and really every other line he does like that one\) is just proof of how far he's come as a vocalist. I get chills at that flute\-like vibrato. There's also a subtle buzz in the background[ @2:50](https://youtu.be/pKbWGhV0QbE?t=170) that reminds me of a phone receiver when the other person hangs up. Perhaps not intentional, but the lonely atmosphere is still there with unsaid words hanging on the line. 

**134340** \- There's some beautiful atmospheric sounds in this track. That spacy, echoey effect they put on the vocalists during the [chorus](https://youtu.be/_FBYVkn7phA?t=63) totally hits home the orbiting Pluto vibe. AGAIN with Yoongi introducing his bars with a chilling ""[\*suga...\*](https://youtu.be/_FBYVkn7phA?t=98)"" \(like please, I'm already dead.\) But I love how, at first, he sounds muffled, like he's orbiting away from us in an ellipse. But listen for another sudden crescendo right after, where his voice becomes clear and some of the instrumentals come back, and it's like he's orbiting close to us again. They create so much space with their music. 

**Paradise** \- That beautiful vibraphone\-esque synth that is layered beneath Suga's rap [@2:24](https://youtu.be/IIs-TMuMZ20?t=144). wOW. I really love how different the instrumentals and background vocals are for each rapper's part. Namjoon's seems to have a focus on background vocals, while Suga has that starry\-eyed vibraphone, and then Jhope's segment really brings that funky bass line to the forefront and emphasizes it \(which, as we know from \*Hope World\*, is now very symbolic of him as a person.\) ",128,219

1229,2018-5-22,2018,5,22,23,8la7pg,A long ranty preachy post of what we are probably doing wrong in promoting BTS in general and what we should probably start doing to change it,Anayahs,1526997797,"So I posted a thread about this and  someone asked me to put it on here as well, so here it goes.

We really had the perfect promotions leading up to the release of LY Tear. LY Her broke all the records for an Asian artist, Mic Drop Remix made some ripples in the mainstream and we got a solo mixtape to carry the hype onto the release of the next album.

Hope World was commercially successful but I think we messed up whilw promoting Hope World. They released it on a Thursday and we made it chart on BB200. But what we did not do was make it successful critically.

Hope World did not make as big enough ripple as it could have outside of the fandom, and that's a real shame. But the same thing is carrying on to LY Tear musically.

Hope World didn't get the attention outside the fandom it deserved mostly because critics would not touch it. Some because they thought it wasn't really worth reviewing, others because they did not know Hope World ever happened. And that's where our problem lay.

I'm not exaggerating when I say if the fandom gets our priorities straight and buys and streams it properly we can even in just three more days we can push Fake Love to the Top 10 Hot100. And that's scary.

But if that happens ARMY will get all the credit again and BTS and Fake Love will get lost in there somewhere. But this is not an excuse not to stream. We need to make BTS CRITICALLY as well as COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

That's what Hope World didn't have. I could see only one person in my tl @ music reviewers to check out Hope World when it dropped. And I did rt and join in once or twice but soon there was no response and I stopped and nothing happened.

We should start making serious efforts for serious music critics to make reviews of LY Tear. Email them Spotify links, mail them Album copies if you can. Let them know BTS' chart achievements and our aspirations and tell them to let us know what they think honestly. Basically the Dursleys' house with Harry's acceptance letter.

We can even link the reviewers up with their old discography (D&amp;W, YF, Wings, Her) to tell them to see how far BTS have improved. And not just make it about BTS. Say we appreciated their reviews of some other artist. Let them know we value THEIR opinion on a music we like and aren't pushing just for BTS.

Even if we are.

Not just critics, we should go to YouTube reactors who do not cover Kpop normally. I know how many of my mutuals were first exposed to BTS from FBE reaction videos. There are many many YT reactors with thousands of followers we can reach if we start requesting to them. A good example is Dylan Will Not Participate, he's a reactor for western music who recently got into BTS and watches them but isn't bandwagon, has a huge following on the Western front as well and his BTS and other vids get comparable number of views. Kpop reactors we follow just have a limited reach within the Kpop sphere.

And we shouldn't just spam YT comments. Tweet them. Email them. Let them know we follow their work and appreciate their opinions. For bigger channels with 100k+ followers maybe even send them a copy of the album. 

What we are doing is doing our best, focusing on our numbers and chasing away interested who ask even once about BTS on Twitter people with either a essay long thread of 10+ tweets about details they don't need OR memes that should have died in 2015. We say we are a grown up fandom, we need to start promoting like it.

Which brings me to criticism. This is another reason why popheads won't touch BTS, because they don't want thousands of crazy fangirls camping in their mentions over their smallest opinion. We need to grow the fuxk up because BTS aren't in Kansas anymore.

BTS are pretty good in dealing with criticism, and it shows. In every subsequent comeback they have worked with the constructive criticism given to improve. And gains more fans in the process who are ready to defend them to death.

That's the catch-22. The more successful BTS gets the lesser chances are of them reaching the GP because the fandom becomes a barrier they don't want to deal with to get to BTS. We should loosen up.

We should show we are not all crazy following BTS and hanging onto their every word with a hive mind and no opinion of our own. We should show that we can be objective even while supporting BTS wholeheartedly. 

Let's be real we have a lot to say about their songs too, both good and bad. And we should. But not on Twitter where our reach is limited only to ARMYs. Or in r/bangtan which is rarely frequented by muggles. We should actively start writing for our local newspapers, magazines, online portals where GP is more likely to see.

All the 15 tweets long thread under an overwhelmed persons twitter about why BTSpop and not Kpop would serve better in a newspaper OpEd about what makes BTS different. Exhaust all your journalist contacts, see if you can land a writing gig. Or a feature in a podcast. Any form on in into any media where GP is present and will get to know a new perspective about BTS as artists.

We can also go beyond music reviews. If there is someone who has knowledge of arts, history, literature, mythology, dancing, video production, they can write about another aspect of BTS that GP doesn't get from mainstream media. Make them intrigued.

We should even make use of those unofficial lyric videos on YouTube if we can. When I started my BTS journey they really made me find B-Side songs and the format was easy to follow. I lament the lost views but they are a necessary evil.

Our Twitter fandom is strong, and we're moving to FB, IG and Tumblr. We should migrate further to platforms where GP pay attention. But not as an ARMY of fans but as individuals who love BTS and want to talk about them.

I'm planning to make a list of online publications, magazines, blogs, and YT channels we can approach with our own writings OR with review requests. Anyone who has more knowledge than me (because I don't) is welcome to help.

We really need to promote not just by numbers because BBMAs already proved we have them. The best way to shift focus to the content is to talk about the said content where they can see without being suffocated by the numbers.

I'm planning to make a Twitter GC where we can discuss who we can approach for reviews/reactions as well as different platforms we can use for promoting our own content to the GP. My DMs are open @Anayahss if anyone has something to contribute or wants to be a part of the GC. 

I'd love any all feedback as well as better ideas.

But I felt like I wanted to bring it to ARMY's attention. I know many of us want to see only the positive and beautiful moments and qualities of our beloved boys, especially during such an important time such as this. I've heard during comeback season K-pop group and members will tend to lose weight, and have noticed that two of the members have lost quite a bit of weight. 

Particularly Taehyung, and Yoongi. J-hope looks a bit slender as well, but not too much. RM and Jin look good. Jungkook face has a slightly thinned out look but his proportions still look healthy and we all saw him snacking at the BBMA'S. 

When someone loses alot of weight, it tends to really show on their face when they are not eating right. Not only does their face thin out but they look more tired. 

I am pretty worried because in a few months BTS will be heading off for their World Tour and it won't be good if the members are not at a healthy and solid/stable weight. Especially on top of all the strain they put on their body with traveling, short sleep nights (I'm hoping they get enough rest) choreography routines and rehearsal practices. 

https://m.imgur.com/a/KHTRyNA 
(here are pictures for reference) 

Does this tend to happen around Comeback season alot? 

I myself have lost alot of weight recently due to stress a few months ago and I recognize the same signs and tired look on Taehyung's face. :/ 

Again, I'm not posting this to nitpick or critique their body or weight I am honestly concerned especially with their extremly busy schedules and that they will be going on a World Tour in just a few months.. 

Please advise..

1236,2018-5-23,2018,5,23,0,8lax12,"Censoring BTS' ""Fake Love"" and anti Asian racism - a Non American, Asian perspective",Bwacha,1527003468," \[Mods, I know this is a big sub and you're busy but please stop trying to shove this discussion to days old posts that are already buried under selcas, videos etc.\]

For anyone who isn't aware, for North American radio play and live performances the words  \(niga ""nee\-ga"" \- you, you're\) and  \(nae\-ga; I, me\) are being censored \(some sources say the actual lyrics might be changed\). This is because they can sound similar to the n slur. \(I don't say they *do* sound similar, because they don't. There are very clear pronunciation differences in the words in both speech and song the overwhelming majority of the time.\)

The argument for this is that business is business and nobody is making BigHit agree to do this, it's just something they have to do to keep pushing for BTS' success in North America. A potential scandal would of course be terrible so they're doing what they can to avoid it. Complaints about the lyrics, even if incorrect, could get ""Fake Love"" or ""DNA"" pulled from radio play or reduce the number of invites BTS get to perform. I understand these arguments and on a purely business level they are valid.

But I very strongly disagree with this happening.

It is mindblowing that in order to avoid causing offensive and being construed as racist, people are okay with censoring innocent words in another language. That to my mind is offensive and actually racist itself. Yes, when you go to another country you should conform to their rules and culture within reason \- censoring innocent language because it could be misheard by others does not fall within those parameters. It is exceedingly ethnocentric and disgustingly lazy to censor innocent and key parts of another language because instead of encouraging multiculturalism, instead of even putting out a simple release about the language; people would rather take the easy route of letting racism go unchallenged, of actually bowing to it preemptively. Seriously, just sit back for a minute and think about what it really looks and sounds like to have a foreign Asian group censoring their native language because North America doesn't want to deal with it. You cannot tell me that is progress. That is actively hampering progress. That is a gigantic con to any success BTS are experiencing.

And here's the thing: When does it end? Does it ever end?

How long are people content for every day terms in Korean to be censored and reacted to as if inappropriate? Because by censoring I think you're only prolonging that time. By censoring, you're behaving as if these words are actually inappropriate, you're reinforcing the idea that they are using slurs, and you are not normalising the language. People cannot get used to something they cannot see or hear! We cannot defeat these misconceptions if we are 'not allowed' to encounter them and to talk about them and educate on them.

Racists exist. The rest of us are not obliged to entertain them like this. And if you'd like to fight racism and reduce the number of racists, having a racist ruling on a foreign group instead of confronting the actual racists is a little counterproductive.

How do we break down barriers if we're just setting up others at the same time? 

If we're having to censor innocent words in our language when performing a pop song of all things, then how we are better than being dancing monkeys? Just another ""lol those weird Asians"" trend? It's so disheartening. The bar for Asians to get into the Western industry is so high \- why do you think so many gyopo are in kpop? \- and even when a group like BTS gets some traction they're still not getting respect.

As overdramatic and oversensitive as some people might think I'm being these 'compromises' to try and break into the West invariably only go one way just feel like betrayal and Whitewashing. You can be Asian, just don't be *too* Asian. Everyone else listens to English music blasted on the radio etc., but ehhhh dyou think you can tone down the Korean? It sounds a bit weird and like some bad words and we don't wanna put in the effort. North America says jump and the company says how high for exposure which still often amounts to sneering orientalism.

This entire issue puts a horrible taste in my mouth. All I can say is that I'm immensely disappointed. Asians need more representation in the West, [especially Asian men who are so completely underrepresented and desexed and horribly stereotyped](https://twitter.com/marjoriemliu/status/785531042451099648), but this isn't the total win some people seem to think it is. For me personally, this stings. *A lot*. And as an Asian, I can't overlook it or the way anti Asian racism happens and gets brushed over like this all the time as just something Asians need to put up with to make it or just not important instead of seen as the insidious serious issue it is.",1,7

My opinion on tear is I think that all songs are pretty good in general. Deep lyrics, nice vocals, catchy tunes. However the songs are more pop and westernized than their other songs. I definitely dont think its a bad thing though. Theres also a lot less rap line parts in the songs (im not actually sure about this but i feel like its mainly vocal line).

I've been listening to it on repeat and even though it's only been a few days, when I listen to Paradise or Magic Shop, I feel like it really will be okay if I don't make it through the semester. 


I honestly can't express how thankful I am for this album coming out at this time. In terms of their theme, I feel like it's really helping me accept myself and what might happen and it's also telling me that it will be okay.

I'd like to start off by saying this is likely going to end up being really lengthy, so please bear with me and any typos I make! 

My friends and I were fortunate enough to be able to travel from California to Vegas this past weekend to support our boys at the BBMAs. We decided on nosebleed tickets since we knew we were going to spend a fortune on the LY Tour (this was about 2 days before the tour was announced haha), and since we knew they'd only perform one song + receive the award, we decided to be rational for the first time in our lives and not drop any unnecessary money on better seats.

The BBMAs being the 20th, we drove there on the 19th, checked into our hotel, and decided to spend the first night walking down the Las Vegas Strip and search first and foremost for the BTS advertisements we had seen different fanbases on twitter had bought! We were walking with our ARMY Bombs in hand, and along the way we passed by different groups of fans who would yell ARMYYY to us, and us to them in return!! It's silly to say but it made my heart feel so full, being momentarily connected with strangers because of BTS. It's really the little things that make me love being an ARMY.

After walking a bit, we reached the first advertisement, which was from @BTSx50States / @BTSxSouthwest on twitter, promoting Fake Love and BTS' Unicef campaign. It honestly made me a bit emotional as it was my first time seeing any sort of big ad like that for BTS in the states. We took a lot of pictures with it and interacted with other ARMYs who were there, two who told us they traveled from Florida to see them at the BBMAs, and two who were from China!! 

After the BTSx50States ad, we walked just a little further down the strip to the video ad from C-ARMYs, @fallinlove0613 on twitter. Unfortunately I couldn't get a good picture of it, only a video at a weird angle, but if you check out their twitter there are some better videos from other people! Again it was insane to see a BTS ad of that scale in such a crowded area too!!

It was after we finished checking out those ads that Jimin started his vlive that night, and him being my bias I promptly freaked out and we stood to the side and watched him stream in public hahaha

Then, as we were walking to eat on the other side of the street, we saw ANOTHER ad that was even bigger than the other two, this one I'm going to assume from BigHit themselves because it was just the [Love Yourself Tour Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN4_GOtBoj4), and it was, again, incredible to see, especially because of the sheer size of the thing. We couldn't catch a photo or video in time because we definitely had not expected to see that (but for anyone curious [this](https://c7.alamy.com/comp/DTD4X3/bubba-gump-shrimp-co-las-vegas-nevada-usa-DTD4X3.jpg) is the space in which it played like seriously that thing is huge), and even though we went back on the last day to try and catch it it never played again, so it makes me wonder how often it looped and for how long they had bought that ad space for. 

On to the 20th, the day of the BBMAs! That morning we picked up our purple bags for the purple ocean. We also saw a tweet from someone who mentioned there was a BT21 display in the Mandalay Bay hotel, so we set out to find it, and when we finally did we discovered that it wasn't for fans or anything, but rather for the 2018 Licensing Expo, which is held at the hotel's convention center. Very curious to know what will come of BT21 being a part of that... It was also funny because while we were taking 500 photos of it, a man who was going to the expo came up to ask us questions about the characters, who they were, why we like them, etc. It's always amusing to play like spokespeople of sorts for BTS. 

After that and eating breakfast, we stopped by the MGM Grand to try and find another fanproject that we had seen on twitter, and we ended up getting purple rubber wristbands, courtesy of @purekth95 on twitter, that said BTS x ARMY on one side and LOVE YOURSELF on the other. 

We scoped out the general area just to check out if anyone with tickets to the show was lining up yet, and we ended up finding an area outside where people without red carpet passes were apparently camped out to try and see BTS arrive at the red carpet, which was being held right across the street. I later heard from that pretty much the moment BTS arrived, they shut the gates so that nobody who camped out really could see any of them for more than like a second or two :( It bummed me out because although we didn't camp out for anything this time, I myself have camped out and spent long, long hours waiting in line for things before and it's never too fun so I know how much it must have sucked to have that happen, especially after waiting in the Vegas heat. 

But after that, we decided to head back to our hotel to change into our BBMAs outfits, and on the way as we were walking through the MGM Grand, we passed by Liam McEwan (who recently did the video interview with BTS for J-14) and I stopped him very briefly just to mention how much I enjoyed his interview, and he was very friendly and thanked us for watching it in the first place!

Fast forward to being let into the award show, as we were going through the metal detectors + bag check, I watched sadly as two girls in front of me were being told to throw away these huge signs they had brought with them. It was upsetting to see especially as the signs were handmade, so I just want to remind everyone that when you're attending events like this, be sure to double check the size limits and any other rules the venue has on signs, and if you're not sure, ask. 

When we reached our seats I was actually shocked at how much closer they were than I anticipated. That isn't to say they were incredible, but again not as bad as I expected! 

Being at the BBMAs only to see BTS was crazy because there were SO many other ARMYs there to support BTS. Even before BTS were seated, people were doing fanchants. When the actual show started, except for a couple other performances I honestly couldn't focus much on anything except for the backs of BTS' heads LOL, even though we were far away it was really cute watching their reactions to things T_T Hoseok especially was always really into the performances! 

During every commercial break, ARMYs would take the opportunity to do fanchants. Every time BTS was mentioned in the ""coming up next..."", we would scream SO, SO loud, the reaction to any mention of them was much more hyped than for nearly any other artist. It made my heart swell because even though this should have been very obvious to me by now, after that night I went home satisfied knowing 100% that BTS are very well aware of how loved they are, and I'm glad for that.

When they won the award, the reaction was incredible. Seeing them walk up to the stage and to hear the speech in real life was surreal. It was also mildly amusing because though I caught the majority of what Namjoon said, I didn't hear even a single word of what Jimin said at the time because of how crazy the screams got when he moved towards the mic to speak. 

Fast forward to their performance... The moment the song started and I saw them in that beginning formation, the first thing that ran through my mind was ""the non-ARMY audience is probably thinking 'holy shit' right now."" And the fanchants were so on point!! The camerawork however... As everyone knows at this point, it was incredibly, incredibly disappointing. Because I was in the nosebleed seats, I looked between them onstage and the filming onscreen in order to enjoy the performance, but it felt like EVERY TIME I looked at the screen the camera was not on BTS, but on a fan or the crowd. And like... on one hand I get it. I really get that it's amusing to the general public to see fans go so hard for this group. But it makes me so incredibly irritated to know that Billboard was more focused on promoting the image of their ""crazy, rabid fanbase"" rather than the group's damn performance that they worked INCREDIBLY HARD to show to everyone. I have so much that I could say about this.

Regardless, after the performance I genuinely felt like I had never been so drained in my entire life, both physically and emotionally. This was the sixth time I've had the chance to see BTS, but right after this performance... I cried harder than I have at any other concert/event I've attended. I was crying to the point where I couldn't even stand up and enjoy, let alone pay attention to, the last performance of the night. Because what was running through my mind at that point were the following things: 1. The sense of community between ARMYs is incredible, 2. BTS definitely know how loved they are, and 3. They've come so, SO far. At this point they're bigger than they probably would have ever expected at the time of their debut, and they're only going to get bigger. It's so surreal every time I think about it. I'm so proud of them. 

Something that really upset me though is this: as I and one of the other friends I was with cried after their performance, a woman in the row right in front of ours noticed, turned around, and began speaking to the other half of our group about our crying, asking if we're okay, but not out of genuine concern. Pointing out that it's crazy that we were still crying even a while after their performance, through what I believe was the last commercial break (I can't quite remember because of the obviously strong emotional reaction I was having lol). And I wish I could make this next part up - she asked our friends if we like them for their music, or just because we think they're hot. And had I caught that she had said that in that moment, had I not been crying my eyes out, and despite my desire to spread a good image of our fanbase, I know I wouldn't have been able to hold myself back from giving a slightly snappy response. It's upsetting to be mocked like that. I really don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that our emotional responses are not just because they're good looking. 

Brings me to the next thing - on the car ride back yesterday, we were able to catch the interview BTS did with 102.7 KIIS FM, one of LA's biggest radio stations. Like a broken record, the host asked what is the craziest thing a fan has ever done. The connotations of this question, which is clearly to paint fans in a negative manner, upset me to no end. I hate this question. But Namjoon answered just as he did in another interview I'd watched, in a positive way by bringing up the purple ribbon project at the airport again, talking about how ARMYs put that together for their safety. And I'm so grateful for the way he answers that question.

I'm grateful that Namjoon mentioned in this year's BBMAs acceptance speech, too, the fact that fans have told them their music has changed our lives. I'm glad he's always trying to speak up for us and portray a positive image of us, rather than what it seems the media and so many others want to see us as. 

After attending the BBMAs, I know that there's going to be a LOT of negative light from US media on ARMYs, trying to show us as crazy for their amusement instead of focusing on the reasons why we love BTS so much, instead of focusing on the messages they try to spread and on the incredible music they put out, the incredible performances they do; but if there's one thing I was able to take away from all of this, it's that I love being an ARMY. Time and time again, no matter how many things I attend, no matter the different types of people I meet and reactions I get, that fact never changes. I love the sense of community we have. I love the way we support our boys. I love knowing that there are other people who have been so moved by their music and words. I love going to BTS events and recognizing people from the other things I've been to, too. No other group has changed my life like this, and I'm eternally grateful for the memories they've helped me make and the friends they've brought me to.

1312,2018-5-23,2018,5,23,16,8lhi39,Questioning BTS PAK,HarrayS_34,1527060697,"Did BTS come back in an empty house? Was their PAK the result of fandoms streaming or the recognition of general public? 

I went across this post, made by a non fan who knows a lot about korean charting, that analyzes the amount of BTSs UL (unique listeners) on Melon. The point of the post was to show that BTS has not TRULY captivated the gp with Fake Love, because the amount was low compared to other songs that have achieved PAK before. 

Keep in mind, i am a true Army through and through, I have no intention to undermine BTS in anyway, my purpose is to inform other Armys so they dont go around spreading false information about BTSs digital power. When BTS got their first PAK, no one is more happy than I am, but once I went through this post, I was a bit shocked, given my limited knowledge regarding korean charts and all. Im gonna translate what the post says (its in Vietnamese), and if theres anything wrong that others want to correct, I would appreciate it since I dont know enough to judge the validity of this post. 

Unique listeners for songs with PAK, for example, Bigbang (1M UL), Ikon (700k) Heize (1M). For BTS, they earned around more than 600k UL on the first day, losing 100k the following day, and around now its 400-500k. Lets talk about males and females listeners percentage. PAK songs which truly have the attention of gp usually have around 50:50 males:females, sometimes the difference is there but tiny, however BTS is 17:93 males:females. 

Songs that get PAK on the debut day will have the highest UL, and the following days if the songs suit the taste of gp, it will drop in UL somewhat but maintain a certain high amount, enough for them to keep scoring PAK. Yet, Fake Love with 690K on its first day continues to lose more UL by 200K, now its around 400K at most. If it continues to fall like this, dropping on real-time chart is certain, however since there arent any strong competition on the list, BTS continues their reign as #1 with the help of the strong fanbase. 

Up till now, digital charts are seen as the most fair judge of the demand for the songs that cant be ruined by fandoms manipulation, yet, even now digital charts can be controlled, its a bit unfair for groups with smaller fandoms. 

What do you guys think? I really wanted to have a discussion about BTSs digital power, as I believe its what made an artist successful and most legitimate. In this digital world, the amount of digital consumers indicate the actual power of the artist, how they could be in demand of gp as well and not only the dedicated fandom. ",59,0

1317,2018-5-23,2018,5,23,18,8li176,Love Yourself: Tear - Album Discussion 2.0 (mature version),omelimo,1527068040,"TLDR: this album's discussion on r/kpop was insubstantial and very close-minded (everything people disagree with gets downvoted). This is a chance to actually DISCUSS the album. Please share your honest opinions and feelings about it and explain why you liked it/didn't like it. If you disagree with someone, don't downvote, but argue.

Hello everyone! 
I originally wanted to put something along the lines of ""analytical /respectful / in-depth / constructive criticism "" in the brackets but I reckoned the whole thing would end up a bit title-gore(y). I chose mature because in the album discussion of LYT on r/kpop there wasn't really a real discussion going on. Well, there was, but those discussions ended up in the controversial section. 
I'm aware that when a new album drops the first thing people want to do is live out the hype and ""celebrate"". Sitting down and discussing the album in an objective way isn't really part of that. But given that the thread was tagged ""Album Discussion"" and the majority of upvoted comments were either witty remarks or very unoriginal ""THIS IS LIT"" kind of comments I got a little bit annoyed. Especially when I saw that comments like ""I don't like it"" (which is equally as insubstantial as the ""this is lit"" comments) and actual reviews which were critical but constructive all ended up being downvoted.

Album discussions really shouldn't be like that and because little to nothing constructive came out of that thread I wanted make this 2nd album discussion with the idea that people can share their honest opinions about the album in a constructive way. Review the album! Did you like it? Why? If you didn't like it, also why?

There are many people who seem to have found a new all time favorite with this album and others who are very disappointed. I've seen a lot of mixed opinions about it and that alone would make for a very interesting discussion (if we all remain unbiased and objective). I know people here can have very thought provoking and interesting opinions. I was actually inspired to make this thread after I read this awesome thread (which was unfortunately removed) which talked about promoting BTS in a more mature way. People had started to analyse the BTS-ARMY relatipnship and had become very self-aware of some potentially destructive behavior in terms of promoting the group. It was truly fascinating and showed me that there are many armys here who can and want to approach loving/supporting BTS more critically.

Thank you for participating and have a nice day :)",12,12

1339,2018-5-24,2018,5,24,3,8llop1,Why is it that BTS fans constantly have to justify why BTS is so popular?,BookBindings,1527099997,"The 'I don't get the hype' and 'Why do people like this' comments seem so disingenuous to me. Like 'people better have a good reason for liking these Koreans'. I mean, even if their music is not to your taste, watching a few current mv's or something would be enough to tell you why people like them if you were really interested; how can it be such a mystery?  For example, Big Bang is not a group I really listen to, but when people call them the kings of kpop I completely get it, taste notwithstanding. It's just common sense.

It is not as though hugely popular people like Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift or Drake have this great reason for being popular. They are good entertainers, they have their talents and they appeal to many. The fact that they appeal to so many people does not mean that they must surely be massively more talented than anyone else. 

Then Armys have to go on these long spiels about how BTS is socially conscious and writes meaningful lyrics, makes their own music and is miles ahead anything else in kpop- which is fine (even though not 100 percent true, particularly for the latter two), but come on,  it is not as if all the currently most popular western artists are famous for being heroes of justice, originality or nobility.
It just annoys me that we must constantly explain why we like BTS to these 'go on, impress me' type people just because they dare to appear on an American awards show. Are there different standards for musicians who don't speak English?
Personally, I would still listen to BTS even if they sang only love songs (which people, for some reason seem to look with disdain upon, but whatever) because I like them as entertainers and as people. 

Even a number of news articles seem to feel the need to scramble to find reasons for why a kpop group should have any business being so popular. Why is there still even a need for this?

If people feel too superior or are too prejudiced to appreciate the obvious, then they can just move along instead of apparently expecting to be dazzled by a performance featuring levitating animaguses before they can 'get the hype'. And I don't take that language barrier thing as any excuse- American artists are hugely popular even in countries that do not speak English, so it should not be so shocking that the phenomenon can go both ways, even though the advantage is obviously skewed towards English-speaking artists on account of the popularity of the language.

Anyway here ends my rant. I should hope I don't always get ranty when BTS makes an American appearance, but something always crops up.

I would like to hear others' thoughts!",13,9

We're still reeling from comeback, followed immediately by BBMA's, but #ARMYMustServe hasn't been sleeping!

# Week 1 Updates
**Here's what we've accomplished in our first week together:**

- 51 volunteer hours rendered;

- 10, 960 grains of rice donated towards the World Food Programme;

&amp;nbsp;

**That's not all, though!**

- Group projects are also being organized in 12 cities around the world. Join a group or start your own (we'll connect you with your fellow ARMYs in the area!) through this [group participation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdk3Oo6m-irv-vSHiw9NFUty3T2ODfAjcFwne-Ur-_oV7weSw/viewform).

# Online Group Activity: Freerice.com

For this week's online group activity, we'll be focusing on [freerice.com](http://freerice.com). Answer multiple-choice questions -- ranging from English vocabulary words to Math problems to Geography trivia and SO MUCH MORE -- to earn free rice for World Food Programme (WFP), the food assistance branch of the United Nations. It's a quick and fun way to help out!

&amp;nbsp;

**Our goal is to raise 1 million grains of rice!** This is amount is just enough to nourish 7 people for 7 days.

**If we reach this goal**, the Projects Team will be sharing gifts with the following people:

- Top Scorer
- Runner-up
- 3 Random Participants

Winners will pick (in order) from the following pool of gifts:

- Gift 1
- Gift 2
- Gift 3

You can also transfer the gifts to a person of your choice!

**To join the contest, please fill out the group participation form first. This will give you a link where we will provide further instructions.**

Of course, if you would prefer to not join the competition, it's totally fine! Just send us screenshots of your rice through our [activity log](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdny3H1DcuD9BOSWsHC5Up_NGx1M9OsQiflfmVvSiB_hAAaFA/viewform).


There are ~27k people in this sub, so if each person raises just 40 grains of rice (that's only *four* clicks) we'll hit our goal of 1 million!

I mean fair enough if you think their songs are not popular enough in the UK to be played on your station, no problem. But the more he felt he needed to justify himself, the less sense he made.

Does he really think so many people would like BTS primarily for their looks? I mean they are good looking enough, but really? Does he think they are sirens or what?  And does he really think BTS fans are generally such idiots? It is not surprising that he finds the dedication of the fanbase overwhelming, but if 'looks not music' is what he thinks makes a reasonable explanation, then I don't know what to say.

Besides which, if you yourself listen to their music and find it enjoyable or not, that is up to you, but their legions of fans liking them for their looks should have nothing to do with your decision to play their song on your station.

I will not even get into a young man of his age referring to the BTS members as 'kids'.

And this part: Especially in the K-pop world, where its about so much more than the singles they release. For us, its just the music.'

I don't see how concept, aesthetics and performance forming part of the package with a kpop release is at odds with their station being purportedly 'only about the music'. I mean, if the song is a hit, that should be enough. Nobody is asking you to play teasers and music videos. 

Unless I am misunderstanding something- then I would be happy if someone explained it to me.

But anyway, what has annoyed me is his posting the article to twitter with 'Cue twitter meltdown'. What exactly was the goal there?

I even wish Armys would have just ignored that tweet, but who am I kidding.",2,2

Recently I was playing Superstar and found myself wondering what it would take for BTS to win a Grammy. When watching their U.S interviews, it was obvious that Yoongi's comment was semi-sarcastic in mentioning that after conquering the BBMA's stage, the next big milestone would be the Grammy's. However, with their evident success in the U.S, and Tear fighting for the #1 spot with Post Malone, is BTS winning a Grammy so far-fetched? I'm not very familiar with how the Grammy's operate, so I wanted to know what exactly would need to be accomplished for this to happen? 

What category would be best suited for them in succeeding? What charting/ streaming milestones do they need to surpass within the U.S? Are Grammy's awarded based off of achievements or is there voting done by a board of appointed people?

1365,2018-5-24,2018,5,24,9,8loclg,180523 Regarding Comment Score and Other Things,Eren_,1527121513,"Hello, lovelies!

During the morning of the 22nd, we received a suggestion through Modmail that we thought good to implement. 

As many of you must know (if you're a redditor), many subreddits hide the comment score for a period of time as to not  not influence others when voting. This is something that discourages the unfair piling-on of downvotes *and* upvotes.

**From now on, comment score will be hidden during the first 300 minutes (5 hours)**. The reason for such a long period is that, as moderators, we know when a thread generates much traffic people keep commenting and refreshing the submission for hours. 

We hope with this change that people stop to think if what's said in the actual post and comment is something valuable that deserves to reach the top; if it's informative and doesn't break any rules.

That said, we would also want to address a trend we have noticed even more as of late.

---

We know that, sometimes, when discussing things we are passionate about or when trying to show your point of view to others, things might get out of hand. This is usually when a long comment chain of back and forth conversation will be created. However, the longer the chain, the more chances it has of delving into something where both or one of the parties is not listening to the other. 

When such thing happens, we would like to advise the subscribers to just walk away; take some time off for yourself. Continuing to fight an useless battle won't change anyone's point of view nor will it help on getting your point across.

This also applies towards strong emotional outpours. 

We understand that your feelings are valid just as any other, but we'd like you to ask yourself: *""is this something that can lead towards a productive and contructive conversation?""*. 

Many times when this happens it just creates an uncomfortable environment for others, which then leads into a tense comment chain. This is also where the above would once again applies. 

Taking a moment for yourself and letting steam off would guarantee that both you and others wouldn't have the day ruined by a back and forth conversation that would end up not being productive.

Having a healthy, rational conversation where both parties are not emotionally compromised and listening to each other would be ideal as no friction would be created.

We would like you to also apply the last three paragraphs towards drama from other platforms. When you see something from another place, be it Tumblr or Twitter, which upsets you greatly and you think is unfair, instead of spreading such things and upsetting others too please take a moment to re-evaluate why it makes you feel that way and why you feel the need to inform others about it. Will it just turn into finger wagging or head shaking in which nothing can be done? **If it is not constructive, it does not need attention.** 

The more eyes you turn towards something, the bigger it will become. Let things fade into obscurity and have no place in yours and others lives. Don't spread things and they will die out. Not giving attention to people who spread hate is how you get them to stop; show how useless their efforts are. 

However, if you get angry and bring them to attention, all you do is give them more fuel. Take a breather, walk off and think again about your motives and what it will accomplish. Would posting about it and bring it to light truly achieve something productive other than multiplying the hate and spreading negative feelings?

I logged into fancafe just now to just look around but when i went on my account i realised my fancafe nickname was different to what i put on my application. Is there a difference between fancafe nickname and the name you use to login? Im kind of stressed out bc i missed out on last years membership:(. Just to be sure i edited my nickname to the same name i use to log in but i dont know if its too late now.

 - Wonder - Intro: Euphoria - Jungkook solo
 - Her - Intro: Serendipity - Jimin solo
 - Tear - Intro: Singularity - V solo
 - Answer - Intro: Epiphany - Jin Solo

Personally Im hoping for a collab between Jimin and RM since I havent seen them work on something together other than AHL and Serendipity. Maybe a J-Hope and V dance-off since the latter is now a member of the dance line, along with Suga because dude is underrated when it comes to dancing. Then a Jin-JK ballad perhaps!

In my dream I was fangirling over V pretty bad and just wanted to talk to him, but I played it cool. Eventually I got into a conversation with them, but for some reason hit it off way more with JK instead.   
He pulled up a map on his phone and pointed to a location, saying he had just bought an apartment there in Brooklyn, and was excited to visit there during downtime. I don't live anywhere near Brooklyn and never have, so not sure where that came from lol.   
Eventually I admitted that I was super excited to meet them, and just wanted a hug. JK was the only one who would let me hug him lol, and he was really shy about it. Eventually they had to go and I was like, ""yo hit me up when you're in Brooklyn"" and I woke up.  

I can only explain this as Jungkook always trying to break my Vmin bias.

I thought the mixtape was for rappers to release songs without anything holding them back content wise. Is it still called a mixtape if it's not rap but singing? /this might sound like a really dumb question but I really don't know I'm sorry orz

A follow up question: As we see from Magic shop and the songs he's covered Jungkook goes for the more mellow sounds, which are to say ' public friendly '. In that case why not just release an album instead of a mixtape. I doubt bighit wouldn't support him given they've released 3 mixtapes so far.

First, I want to apologize for not beeing part of the ARMY and for not knowing this things...

The fact is that my girlfriend is a huge fan of BTS and she is a proud member of the ARMY. 
She really wants to go to a concert since BTS is doing a worldwide tour. We decided some days ago, that Berlin was the best option for us and we were decided to buy the tickets, flight and so.

The thing is that (for some personal reasons) she can't afford the tickets. She was the one who knew how to do get them, what day was the best, the place and everything related to the concert.

Now, I'm trying to buy the tickets by my own. She thinks that we won't go because we have no money but I just had a promotion at job and I want to give her a nice surprise.

I'm posting this beacause as the title says, I need help in order to buy those tickets... There are a lot of places where I can buy the tickets from, 2 days of concert (October the 16th/17th), a lot of different tickets with different prices... As I said, my girlfriend is the real fan of BTS and she was the one who was going to buy them...

I have this questions: 
 Which is the best website to buy the tickets?
 Which ""zone"" of seats is the best? (She wants to be able to have a seat if she gets tired since the concerts are really long)
 If someone has already bought tickets for BTS, could you tell me the process? I mean, this is the first time I buy some tickets and I don't know exactly how to do it. My girlfriend told me that it will be really hard to get the tickets because a lot of people would be trying to get one... I don't wanna mess this up.


Thank you for reading my post (if you made it this far lol) and thank you all for the help. 

Have a nice day ;)

Not sure if there's a precedent for bringing boybands to the festival scene (or K-pop at all for that matter - there was Epik High at Coachella a few years ago).

First, do you think having BTS at a festival is a good idea? They already have so much on their plate. Would fans prefer to see the boys exclusively on an arena tour like the upcoming one? Would it be good exposure for them to perform in front of festival goers who have no idea who they are? I haven't heard of idol groups even performing at Korean festivals, but please let me know if I'm wrong.

Second, do you think Big Hit would be open to this? Like I said before, not sure if Korean entertainment companies have had to deal/negotiate with foreign festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, etc. Would these festivals pay enough for Big Hit to deem it a worthy undertaking when they're selling out arenas? Has BTS grown too big for festivals? 

Third, if yes to both questions above, what can we as ARMY do to bring this idea up to festival planners and convince them to book BTS? 

I think some of this requires knowledge on the business/economics of festivals but please let me know what you guys think!",22,35

Even the guitar has this kind of watery distortion, and I thought it tied really well with the theme of being trapped under a lake in the lyrics.

Another thing is, in this album there was a large use of autotune, and in Singularity, again, voices are mentioned multiple times, like in ""i buried my voice for you"" and ""tell me, if my voice is fake"". Hiding/modifying one's voice in this case could also mean hiding one's self?

What do you guys think? Have you found anythinh similar in this album, or in other bts works?

(this isn't a question of their actual popularity as separate people, I know that that is against the rules, I'm more asking *why* this issue exists in kpop fandom in the first place). 

An OT7 stan who voices a practical opinion gets called an unloyal OT6 stan, and yet I've seen so many people say that they won't listen or watch anything that doesn't have their bias in it, for whatever reason, and that's considered totally ok. How can you claim to be a fan of a group if you only like the things your favorite member is in? There's this attitude that if you like all seven of them equally you must love them all less or be less of a fan. Its just so bizarre to me, as someone who isn't a part of the overall fandom. I know this is a question that applies to all of kpop, but I'm posting it here because I'm asking specifically as it applies to Bts and Army because I'm just not very familiar with anything else.",16,0

1518,2018-5-26,2018,5,26,10,8m6yij,180520 BBMAs Red Carpet Fan Account + Pictures,kamorakpl,1527299907,"First post here so please bear with me!

I had purchased tickets in advance of BTS being announced as performers and was ecstatic that they were going to have their comeback stage there. As an I\-fan, the chances and logistics of me attending any sort of comeback stage was slim so this was truly once in a lifetime opportunity for me. Previously, I had attended AMAs but it was a closed red carpet so I had been debating for a very long time whether or not I wanted to chance it at the BBMAs and wake up super early to wait. 

My flight was the afternoon of the day of the album drop. 30 minutes after the album dropped, I received an email stating that I had been chosen to attend the red carpet fan pit. At this point, I am so excited but I pictured it as a large fan enclosure in the front of the red carpet where we could see BTS pass by.

On my way to MGM, I saw the enormous amount of fans already waiting for BTS at the red carpet entrance. I arrive at MGM Studio B around 1 per the instructions in the email and while the seatfillers were being let in at a constant stream, the red carpet line was left standing for over an hour. We were starting to get anxious after only a group of 20 fans were let in after 1.5 hrs. Luckily, I made it in with the third group and I think only a few other girls more were let in from the line until they closed it off. There was some miscommunication at the front of the line and the staff was ready to refuse checking IDs because so many of the names did not match the list even though they claimed they had emails as well. I said a quick prayer and thankfully, my name was on the list. Overall, the process was a bit more disorganized than I would have liked and it was disappointing for a lot of the girls waiting behind us that had arrived early as well.

Eventually, we were led out to the red carpet and were told we would be in the fan pit as part of VLive's broadcast. All of us were shocked at how \[close\]\([https://twitter.com/portrait\_of\_you/status/998324251584184321](https://twitter.com/portrait_of_you/status/998324251584184321)\) we would be to them. Our hosts were very polite to us and interacted with us playfully in between interviews despite the heat and staff provided water. VLive also handed out some swag bags with VLive lightsticks and VLive x BTS banners for us to hold. Around 3, we could hear screaming, presumably assuming BTS had already arrived. 

FINALLY, BTS ARRIVED\- \[photo dump here\]\([https://twitter.com/portrait\_of\_you/status/1000178827790835712](https://twitter.com/portrait_of_you/status/1000178827790835712)\) . They came in single file, with Yoongi leading and Jhope and Jimin rounding the line out. They interacted with us by waving and saying hi\- I won't go into all the details about how all of them looked different in person versus on screen versus in concert because I could probably write a novel at that point. The most noticeably different to me were Jhope, Jin, and V. Jhope had really delicate and pronounced features\- even though my bias is Jimin, I was taken aback by how beautiful he was. V had really intense features that filled his face and almost looked intimidating when not smiling. Jin is always our lovable goofy madnae but it was truly seeing him in person that made me realize we were the same age\- his face was very mature/manly and had really smooth features. Jungkook stood a bit behind the group and while he was quiet, he turned around to look at both sides of fans. He bent down in a mini bow whenever he looked over so he could meet our eyes as the interview platform was elevated as well as the boys being quite tall haha.

They ran through the interview quite quickly which you can rewatch on VLive. Since the interview boxes were quite small, I ended up standing about 6 inches away from Jhope. It was 95 degrees and I was semi\-hyperventilating from anxiousness and the heat but all I could think was how I didn't want to breath on him. Go figure haha. After the interview, they hugged the hosts and chatted for a bit before they exited. About a million thoughts were running through my head about how I quickly wanted to say Suga's lyrics changed my life or how I admired Jimin work's ethic but then Jimin turned around and waved and smiled in my direction and every thought flew out the window. sigh. haha.

Other artists visited us and quite a few knew of BTS or asked us to tell them more about BTS! Luis Fonsi and Derek Hough both mentioned how cool BTS was and we even exclaimed BTS when Luis Fonsi was asked about possible collab. We tried to show our support for all of the artists despite the heat.

The boys had great reactions during the other artists' performances\- there are a lot of fancams out there where you can watch this \(particularly during Khalid/Normani and Demi\). I was a tad sad to see they had to leave after accepting their award to get ready and missed out on Janet Jackson's performance. It always amazes me and probably amazes them too at how different the atmosphere is in Korean v American award shows. During all the commercial breaks, fans started the ""Kim Namjoon, Kim Seokjin....BTS"" fanchant and after the 3rd time, I started to wonder if they thought we were like annoying parents at their kids' talent shows.

Right before they went up, the show's casters started calling out for the ""BTS lightstick girls"" to come with her even if we were seated. They moved us up to the front of the seated area \(not the floor\) so the lightsticks were more consolidated\- so you can imagine I was not really surprised by the number of audience shots haha. It was BTS's front seat and small details like this, having a separate vlive booth and fan pit that really made me realize their status had yet again changed since last year. They were really trying to cater to BTS as superstars this time around. 

The performance was so well put together and the fanchants were absolutely fantastic \(shoutout to the armys who handed out the purple bags and also the fanchant guides!\). The muggles around us were extremely confused\- ""Who is PMS?"" ""Are they Japanese 1Direction"" ""Wow the screaming is nonstop"". However, after the performance, two guys behind me asked if they were really that popular and the song was ""aight"" and he might give it a spin if it's on spotify. Of course, me being the recruitment fairy I am, I immediately told him the full album is on spotify and laid some basic education of which other songs he should check out. :\)  

This entire weekend felt like a dream and I honestly could not be prouder when I overheard murmurs about how talented they were and how amazed nonfans were at their endurance, comparing them to beyonce, JLo, and other artists known for their live performances. Even seeing celebrities walk up to them during commercial breaks felt like a dream, for me and I'm sure for BTS too. Shoutout to all the old Armys who have hyped them all the way here and all the new Armys who are about to join. I can't wait for this week's Billboard charts to be released and continue to see the impact and influence this performance will have brought them! I really feel that every day in this big family that is Bighit/BTS/Army is a wild ride and that our dreams just continue to get bigger. Grammys next?

1524,2018-5-26,2018,5,26,11,8m797f,What should make someone an ARMY?,Notired16,1527303036,"Since the comeback hype has settled a little and some time has passed since the initial comeback performances, I'd like to ask a question relating to some topics that I've seen discussed in some of the more recent posts.
I've read many discussions by now about the fandom, how we should act, what we can do to help the boys and at the same time, where we need to make sure our limits are.  This has made me think about who can call themselves ARMY.

To me, I wouldn't call all those who know of and listen to BTS an ARMY, maybe they just know of them through others, or like a couple tracks but not all, or on the opposite end, I wouldn't call sasaengs ARMYS either.  But I'm starting to think that being an ARMY might be a bit more complex than this.

With the fandom growing in number every day, I feel that in those numbers there may be some who are fans only of the faces and the moves and I'm not sure if I want to call those who aren't interested the people that BTS are, their motivations, and the meanings behind their work (with allowances for new fans, we all need time to fall down the hole)-
ARMYs, fans perhaps, but not ARMYs.

But this is my opinion and I'm curious to know what kinds of thoughts you all have on this matter.

Also thanks for reading through all this. :)",46,0

They are in the height of their career right now and the steady stream of content from them is so awesome to have. Like you all, I love not only their creative output, but their infectious and lovable personalities. It makes me so happy to see them reaching success and fame. 



However, one day they will not be a band anymore, and we will all be older. I was just thinking how great this moment is right now. That all of us armys get to congregate here together and talk about people and music that we love. I think of how we will all one day be old and look back on our time with BTS as a happy time in our life. I really am savoring these moments and this comeback.

&amp;nbsp;

BTS recently won the Billboard Top Social Artist Award for the second year in a row at the 2018 BBMAs. Some find it surprising that a Korean act won an award at the BBMAs, an awards ceremony of Billboard, which is a brand that everyone knows when it comes to pop music. Some find it amazing that the reaction seen in the video is enthusiastic, and some even casts doubt as to how popular BTS really is. Sometimes, knowing that Top Social Artist Award winner is selected based on fan votes, some consider BTS winning the award as a temporary phenomenon made possible by hardcore fans extreme devotion. This is why it is important to see what they have become in the music market over the past year rather than their winning the award itself.

To be nominated for Top Social Artist, one needs to have accomplishments on Social 50 chart. This chart measures the intensity of interactions on the artists website and various social media platforms. As it is already widely known, BTS has been putting specialized efforts into this, and has ranked at #1 for 75 times so far. Lets have a look at the charts of this very moment. On Artist 100 that will be published tomorrow, BTS is ranked at #4. Artist 100 is a more complicated chart, which ranks artists by combining various measures of popularity including social media activities, album sales, and radioplays. Billboard 200, which will be released on the 27th, is based on album sales including physical sales, digital sales, and streaming. For the last three consecutive weeks, Post Malones beerbongs &amp; Bentleys has been topping the chart. He is expected to earn 110,000 equivalent album units in the fourth week, mostly driven by streaming. BTS is predicted to earn about 100,000 equivalent album units, mostly driven by physical album sales. The market predicts that BTS will at least be ranked at #2, with their topping the chart still remaining as a possibility. When Kelly Clarkson introduced BTS as the biggest boy band in the world, she really just said what it is.

In the pop music market that is centered on English-speaking world, there is also a history of boybands or idols. The current pop market deals with BTS on the extended line of such history. The market does not see BTS as a temporary phenomenon fueled by online memes or a situation where K-POP, a specific regions wave, earns its international fame. Above all, the mechanism where fans activities induce general popularity of artists is already known to be the newest and most important operational principal of the music market. Billboard, in their special column in the end of last year, has already covered the relationship between fans and artists, taking Taylor Swift, One Direction, and BTS as examples, and how it affects the market overall. When one says that social media and streaming are changing the music market, what is common between the two of them is that we can observe and analyze all consumption behaviors real-time. It all remains as data: whos getting attentions and whos listening to whose music more. The focus of music market has moved from physical and digital sales to streaming, and it does not only mean that the method of listening has changed. Currently, the music market is not about who sells more but about who is listened to more. The shouts and screams at concerts or awards ceremonies are just one aspect of it. Therefore, no one in the music industry can treat BTS success as a temporary hype that cannot sustain.

It is natural that there are more interviews asking the production process or thoughts to DJs and producers who have worked with BTS. According to Steve Aoki, DJ Swivel, and Ali Tamposi, BTS is a team who searches for producers who can express the genre and mood the best for each and every track of their album, makes a challenging request to break from the signature sound of producers, and, by doing so, can explore more options than anyone else. This boyband endlessly expands, standing on the basis of their fandom, and successfully executes works that are outside of the boundary of boybands. In short, we are witnessing the latest update in the history of the boyband evolution. ",6,224

They start recording as early as 2 AM and are recording multiple times. Recently there have been news about how some "" privileged "" ""fans"" with connections were allowed to enter into their dressing room and meet BTS. The connectionless armys also got mistreated by the staff. 
Korean promotions are always hard on the artist but I rememeber that it wasn't this bad in the LYH promotions. 
Why should BTS still promote in these shows which have some of the worst viewer ratings in Korea and bring almost zero money to the artists? I've read somewhere that it's the artists company who have to pay these shows to get their artists a stage there. 

Do you think that BTS now is big enough to skip these shows completely ? 
And if they do so how badly will it effect their connections with that particular broadcasting channel? 
Are their any kpop groups before BTS who have skipped these shows ?

Personally , I wish they would skip these shows , but BH isn't rich enough yet to deal with the big people in this industry . They only have BTS and I don't see them taking any step that will anger these broadcasting stations. 
Though I really wish they man up and do something . ",21,18

#Vote for BTS on Music Shows!  

Hello! I know how much of a pain it is figuring out how music show voting works, so I decided to compile a guide here to detail how to support BTS in getting more music show wins (and so I can see my [OTP](http://68.media.tumblr.com/24aba1f5bc1f06bde8c11b44e74a6b47/tumblr_ohkue26RBk1qhmfcoo3_250.gif) of [Suga](http://66.media.tumblr.com/112f0ff274da307f6b4bc7c9486be4c1/tumblr_o0n6mrQ2Yl1s8hxm5o3_250.gif) [x](http://gifgifs.com/res/0516/57364c0ad0941666240177.gif) [trophy](http://33.media.tumblr.com/7a6ff1961076d15ef1c6e23b1ba7de93/tumblr_nnzap9U9JT1tkj9elo4_250.gif) once again. Annoyingly, each music show has it's own rules and ways of determining the winner so I'll detail it all here for this round of promotions. (If I've left anything out please let me know~!)

N.B: everything I say is spoken objectively.  I don't mean to start any sort of argument here, and neither do I want to spread negativity. These are just mere observations I've made that i want to peacefully talk about, 
We've all accepted over the years about how Seokjin was the ""dancing hole"" of Bangtan, but he improved by leaps and bounds this comeback- and he has had more lines as well. Objectively speaking though, you can claim  that the choreography this time wasn't as complicated as it has been in the other albums, (but aesthetically,  their choreography and synchronicity is still an eyegasm)and Seokjin doesn't have difficult choreography when he's  singing his part like Kookie or Jimin do. All that is fine. But I think it's time we stopped calling Jin the dance hole. 
I've always loved his voice- I don't know about his singing techniques- or that of the other members since I don't understand music at all- I would like it if someone explains if (and how) the vocal lines techniques have improved over the ages in terms of techniques. Regardless it's lovely to hear Jin's voice more often since I  really like his voice.
And here comes my most controversial opinion of all- I think LY:Tear is their best album- lyrically,musically, and philosophically. BTS has never really had a problem with deep lyrics but I think LY:Her wasn't  as fulfilling in that department. I was disappointed in the previous album   musically as well, and I feel like DNA  is one of their weakest singles. I didn't really like the lyrics, the music wasn't of my taste either : though I kinda got used to it over time. I sometimes feel Mic Drop, Go Go Go, Sea, Serendipity and Outro:Her were the saving graces of the last album and when I heard DNA I was scared that BTS were going mainstream and were losing their touch . Given that experience, I was extremely apprehensive for this album, and to tell you the truth, I'm over the moon. BTS nailed this album in every possible manner. Fake Love is arguably their best single.
Thanks for listening to this long rant guys. Again, I repeat, not looking stir trouble, just wanted to vent about some unpopular opinions .
Bangtan is the musical version of the kind of thoughts and beliefs I hold. I could never hate them, so please dont misunderstand my feelings",1,0

In the spirit of BTS upcoming anniversary, I want to give back to the community a bit by hosting a giveaway! I hosted another giveaway a couple months ago and I really enjoyed it. My reason for posting this here is that I dont have many ARMY followers on twitter so I hope that this can help the giveaway reach more people! 

You DO NOT have to follow me in order to enter, in fact Id prefer to not have followers who are there solely for giveaway purposes lol. Just read the rules and RT the post to enter! Its that simple ^^ 

And unrelated to the giveaway - I also mentioned that you can feel free to reply to the tweet with a good memory youve made because of BTS, just because I really enjoy reading how theyve impacted other peoples lives! This is totally optional though haha.

As a side note I apologize to those who cant participate because of where they live, its just that my last giveaway winner was an international participant and the shipping cost to send them just a single album was astronomically high, and I just cant afford to do that with multiple winners :( 

Thank you for reading and good luck to all those who participate!",6,51

So, this is my first comeback and my big sister has gotten me into the theories whilst watching [ReacttotheK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPnsmwVKhDJoO7jLKfX0Wxw) has also made me more aware of the musical patterns within the music I'm listening to. 

In the first trailer for ""FAKE LOVE,"" there is a definition given for Magic Shop. It reads: ""'Magic Shop' is a psychodramatic technique that exchanges fear for a positive attitude."" So, listening through *Tear* for the first time, I noticed that the beginning of the album was definitely moodier and it became happier sounding as the album went on. The only out of place one was ""Outro: Tear."" I told this to my sister who said ""The album is playing out like a psychodramatization of the Magic Shop and the song 'Magic Shop' is the the Magic Shop of the album, replacing the negativity of the first half of the album for the happier ones in the latter part."" This effectively blew my mind and I listened to the album again as well as reading through the lyrics of each song. 

And for the most part, it follows the ""Magic Shop"" connection my sister made.  The songs preceding the track ""Magic Shop"" are as follows:

""Intro: Singularity""   
""FAKE LOVE""   
""The Truth Untold""   
""134340""  
""Paradise""  
""Love Maze"" 

and each track is laced with elements of negativity and fear, if not melodically, then lyrically. There are lyrics about the fear of loosing oneself whilst being in a relationship with another person, the fear of being isolated and alone or the fear of not having a big dream to name a few. But then ""Magic Shop,"" a song penned for the fans talks about how Bangtan and the fans can exchange their fears for something better together. And although it is actually not *halfway* through the album, it i definitely a turning point in the album. Its as if BTS is saying that the fans are their Magic Shop and those fears expressed in the songs preceding ""Magic Shop"" is being replaced with the more positive attitude in the latter songs. 

""Airplane pt. 2,"" ""Angpanman,"" and ""So What"" don't ignore the hardships that Bangtan faces, but instead acknowledges them and instead, decides to think of the positive angles of those hardships. For example, ""So What"" encourages the listener to not to overthink and to just go for it, whatever that big *it* is for that individual. So, I presented this argument in the [comments section of reactor BRISxLIFE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnLxMiJ3h8s) I wrote a [draft of what I wrote above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/151528918@N02/42345021732/in/dateposted-public/) and left it to simmer for a bit. I got a few responses and one commenter asked about [""Outro: Tear,""](https://www.flickr.com/photos/151528918@N02/41491951145/in/dateposted-public/) which left me sort of stumped. So, I tried to articulate[ my answer as best I could. ](https://www.flickr.com/photos/151528918@N02/27524164997/in/dateposted-public/) I had interpreted the ""Outro: Tear"" as the rappers finding the bittersweet answer and a lead up to the next album, much as ""Outro: Her"" was a lead up to *LY:T,* where the sentiments of fearing loosing oneself whilst in love is evident. But that answer still seemed sort of off to me. 

**So, this is where the BU Theory stuff comes in:**

My sister was just reading the lyrics to ""Outro: Tear"" and she stopped and asked if I recalled the storyline of each rapper in the *LOVE YOURSELF Highlight Reel.* I recited what I knew: RM and the flyer girl and the hair tie, j\-hope with his mother and the dancer girl and SUGA with the other musician and his cigarettes. She then pointed out that each rapper's lyrics corresponded with the stories told in the *Highlight Reel:*

***RM:***   
*""To me, you were once my dear*  
[*But now youre merely a bitter beer*](https://genius.com/Bts-outro-tear-lyrics#note-14615023)*""*   
When I first saw the *Highlight Reel,* I joked that RM was being a creep and following around this random girl. But my sister pointed out that this could be a post breakup scene. Unlike the other boys who seem to have not yet gotten together/are together with the women in their part of the reel, RM has just left his relationship with this woman, whatever it is that the women represent. This is why he has the hair tie. Its not something he has randomly, but is instead something she left behind after they separated. RM is returning it to her, almost as closure. 

***SUGA:*** 

*""*[*This is the ending you were wishing for*](https://genius.com/Bts-outro-tear-lyrics#note-14600475)  
[*So go on and kill me without hesitating*](https://genius.com/Bts-outro-tear-lyrics#note-14600475)  
[*Woo yeah yeah burn it*](https://genius.com/Bts-outro-tear-lyrics#note-14600475)*""*  
SUGA's story in the *Highlight Reel* shows him having a fight with his girl in the street, screaming and violently rejecting her. His rap talks about his heart shattering and tearing and that is reflected in his anguish during the *Reel.* There is also a smidge of *Wings,* as he raps about burning everything. 

***j\-hope:*** 

*""That I wont cry, that I wont tear it up*  
*I cant say those kinds of words. In the future I, too*  
*Breakup, incurable disease""*  
j\-hope's story revolves around his mother abandoning him at a young age and this new woman who seems to want his heart but he can't give. In this verse, he seems to imply that he cannot offer the love that this new woman wants because of the distrust he has stemming from his past trauma. In the *Highlight Reel* j\-hope is seen thinking of his mother instead of focusing on the sweet gesture of the woman before him. 

The chorus also has the rappers say: 

*""Youre my tear*  
*Youre my, youre my tear*  
*Youre my tear*  
*Youre my, youre my tear*  
*Youre my fear*  
*Youre my, youre my fear*  
*What more can I say?*  
*Youre my...""*

RM takes the first ""tear"" \(teer\), SUGA takes the second ""tear"" \(tair\) and j\-hope takes the fear. 

RM's pronunciation implies the tear that one sheds in sadness. He is tearing up from the sadness of an ending connection. SUGA's pronunciation finds him in a rift between two people, the connection tearing. Finally, j\-hope says ""fear,"" showing that the connection cannot even begin because of fear and hurt. 

The *Highlight Reel* was released prior to *LY:H* but there is no indication that it is solely for the use of this mini album. On the contrary, it is actually the beginning and this is evident in the string section sampling from the *Highlight Reel* within ""Outro: Tear."" As my sister pointed out, the ""Outro"" is the most obvious tie in to the BU within this album aside from the MV for ""FAKE LOVE."" That is why it seems sort of out of place with the progression of the album in terms of the ""Magic Shop"" connection. 

Each BTS album can be consumed beyong the BU, its themes holding their own outside the Universe's context. However, once the put into that context, not every song we can see the connections tying each *LOVE YOURSELF* release together. Even *Love Yourself: Wonder,* ties in. It isn't a full album, but the occurrences within the video work well to parallel the events of *HYYH 1&amp;2, Wings* and *LY:HR.* 

Anyway, that's all my sister and I have for you all at the moment and I'm curious to see if this aligns with any of the theories you subscribe to. Hopefully this is compliant to the rules and you all get to see this so we can discuss. ",1,1

I asked why and she got into some jargon heavy explanations about registers and baritones and ranges and whatever. I always just assumed Jimin was the 2nd best, but my friend says you can hear some straining in Jimin and it's shakier than the others, and she thinks he's the weakest technical singer despite having the prettiest color.

RM: His songwriting in Singularity is still incredible, but besides that, probably his verse in Paradise. Wow it is sexy as hell.
Suga: His line delivery in Magic Shop where he talks about how he let greed get to him gets at me so hard. Something's so emotive and sweet about it in a way that I haven't heard since First Love.
J-Hope: His final verse in Outro: Tear. I know people say it's too short, but I disagree completely. I think its impact hinges on the fact that his delivery is so intense, and its such a big burst of words. Probably my favorite rap verse on the song, the album, and of J-Hope's whole rapping career.
V: Well, all of Singularity is the obvious answer (and it's amazing) but ""WAITING FOR YOU, AN-PAN-MAAAAAAAAAAAAN"" is the true winner.
Jimin: His lines in The Truth Untold, especially ""But I still want youuuuu""

1687,2018-5-28,2018,5,28,22,8mq8ae,Have you experienced insecurity as a result of stanning BTS?,1934escapes,1527515892,"I feel a bit shy coming forward and saying this, but: I feel as though through stanning BTS, I've begun to question the value of my own accomplishments and goals, and I want to know if anyone else feels the same.

Here's come (personal) context: I should be proud of myself. I just graduated from one of the top schools in the world yesterday, I'm going to go work for one of the most prestigious companies in my field, I've moved abroad by myself at a young age, and I did all of this with undiagnosed ADHD and coming from a borderline abusive background. It's not nothing, and I should be proud, but I'm not. Like of course when I write out what I've done, or when my therapist has me say these things out loud, I realize they sound impressive, but when I compare my own accomplishments to what BTS has accomplished, I feel like I'm just some plain person who will accomplish nothing of note in her life. I might get stuff done, and I might have some kind of impact, but it's not going to be as interesting of a story as what's happened with them. And sure, I might make lots of money someday, but it's unlikely I will ever have a fraction of the impact on the world that they've had (especially given my field).

I think seeing the tweet from the President especially sparked these feelings--I thought, ""Ah, well, I'm never going to do anything worthy of that kind of recognition.""

What's weird is that I used to be excited about what I was doing, and excited to make the impact I saw myself capable of having. I studied computer science and wanted to start my own company someday--but now that seems pointless. For some reason, ever since I've gotten really into BTS, I feel a pressure to not consider the value of what I'm doing, and instead I see a much greater value on what they're doing and how they're doing it.

Since I know people will bring it up: I've been talking to a therapist about this. But I feel very much alone in this struggle, and I wonder if anyone else feels the same way, and if you've overcome it, or just in general what you're thinking about it.

I'm having trouble articulating the core of the issue (pulled an all-nighter to pack, so I'm a littleeeee incoherent rn), so I might edit in an executive summary later. But I would love to hear from others who might have gone through this as well, or even something tangentially related.",79,132

1706,2018-5-29,2018,5,29,4,8mswgi,How should we as a fandom react to recent negative attention?,chocobana,1527537571,"Hello, fellow ARMYs. This is something I've been thinking about a lot since BTS went on the BBMAs, their performance videos trended worldwide, and they charted. I think all of us would agree that with a lot more people knowing them, there a lot more racist, homophobic, xenophobic comments going on. There is suddenly a negative stigma for BTS's music as part of a manufactured industry (Kpop), as well as negative stigma for them as a boy group, period. Some ARMYs reply to unjustified hateful comments on twitter with links to stream their music, some clap back, some try to clear away misconceptions...etc. 

I realized a couple of days ago that I spent my entire morning replying to comments on one of their performance videos and it just gave me a lot of needless stress. I thought it might have been better to not have used up that effort. It *is* true, though, that a lot of the sudden negative attention comes from a lack of knowledge to who BTS is. They are unaware they participate in the writing/production of their own music or the kind of issues they discuss in their discography before they call it trash. 

I remember Odie on Twitter (@sweetbtstea) and others talking about our fandom healing after feeling attacked by others in the beginning of BTS's career, and it feels like this is another form of ""attack"" (for people who feel emotionally invested in BTS) when we were just moving on. We saw it coming but it doesn't change how it could affect us.

How do you think we should we be reacting to this? Should we be reacting *at all*? I can see some people not caring, since even this negative attention is a response to BTS's slow foray into mainstream attention. I hope posting this is okay and people can talk about what's bothering them if there's anything and their feelings on the topic.",17,11

1729,2018-5-29,2018,5,29,12,8mvsag,Most favourite and least favourite song of LY: Tear album,altimade,1527563154,"I'm kind of curious, which songs do you guys love the most and least from the album?

My personal fave is outro tear. Rap line killed it. I loved the instrumental of the 3rd highlight reel ever since it was released, but i never thought it would be this badass. Emotionally charged and poetic lyrics. Suga's semi-vocal towards the end though, so good. 

Also i do think that paradise and 134340 are underappreciated. Both are really great, well-made songs but i rarely see people raving about it online. It seems like the general fan fave is magic shop? 

For my least favourite (probably a very unpopular opinion) is anpanman. Not saying it's a bad song per se, but something about how they distort their voices here just puts me off, barely even made it through tae's part at the start. I do like the lyrics though. Then again I belong in the minority who are not big fans of their fun-and-hype tunes (gogo, 21cg, and baepsae - this one probably since i almost got squished to unconsciousness when it was performed at the concert)

Again this is purely my personal opinion on this. It's still a really excellent album worthy to place 1st in the billboard 200 (which makes me so proud for the boys omg)",138,59

Not because I found him annoying or anything (in fact I found him quite funny), but because to me he just seemed like a rapper in the group.

RM was rapper/ leader, and Jhope was rapper/dancer. But in LY:T I fell in love with his rap style. He has a distinct flow but he totally switched it up for LYT!

Before I would just listen to his rap verse then move on, but now Im actually anticipating it.

The bounce and flow in his raps in LYT are sooo good. Personal favorites are his verse in Magic Shop and ofc his verse in Outro: Tear. Its different and so good especially when he uses the low voice with the higher note singing of the same words in the background.

Anyway just something I wanted to say and was wondering if anyone felt the same way!",1,1

 I personally sort of like the idea that the truth will never be revealed to us.

Imagine\- 20 years later, a little girl discovering BTS for the first  time and scrambling through MVs, reels, notes etc looking for clues. Everything is right and everything is wrong\- this is BTS' legacy.

Either the timing is off, the moves (especially the popping) aren't done with strength, or it's too mechanic looking and not artistic enough.  That got me wondering, what other Kpop groups could pull off the choreo?  It has to be every member, because there are definitely kpop groups with one or two members who would excel, but the weaker members would throw everything off.  

I'm not an expert in every kpop group, but the only group that could probably pull it off is NCT, and that is partially because they have like 30 members and their top 7 dancers could probably pull it off.  Are there other groups where the whole group can pull off the choreo?  ",2,3

I thought now would be a good time to put out my thoughts.",_Path,1527735865,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a male in my late 20s and I don't know if I'm ARMY or what but what I do know is that I have a great appreciation for the music and performances BTS have been putting out since I first discovered them.

I actually 'discovered' BTS around 3 years ago although I have been listening to K-pop for over 10 years (started with BIGBANG, SS501, se7en, 1Tym, 2PM, Epik High Beast, Brian, SNSD, Kara, Gummy, 2NE1, damn nostalgia...). So the first couple of songs that I heard from BTS before I even knew who they were, were off YouTube playlists that I'd build when I was in my online gaming phase of life.

&amp;nbsp;

These include:

Coffee

Converse High

Let Me Know

Intro: Never Mind

(probably not tracks you were expecting)

&amp;nbsp;

It wasn't until BTS released Save Me that I actually started looking into them and became interested in their performances (live &amp; dance practice). I would listen to my K-pop YouTube playlist at work (this is before I started using Spotify exclusively) and every now and then I would hear Save Me play and it took about 20 or so plays until I said ""hmm I should look into these guys"". Now, I am not the type of person that follows them on Twitter (I don't have one) nor do I look up every bit of news surrounding them. However, I did make it a habit to follow the releases of their new songs/albums/EPs (this includeded Suga's mixtape which I listened to religiously for like a month straight). I also started paying more attention to Korean music show awards around 2016 that I would watch solely for BTS' performance and be in complete awe. I think the only other group to leave me like that was EXO, however I enjoyed the music of BTS significantly more. I even started watching reaction videos of other artists whenever they performed.

&amp;nbsp;

I guess it's just amazing watching how much this group has progressed in 3 years and although I wasn't there from the beginning it feels nice to watch it unfold as it did. In a way I feel like I ""grew up with them"" even though I didn't. I wish I had people to share my appreciation with much earlier. If you asked anyone 3 years ago if they knew who BTS were they'd give you a confused look and now they are on top of the world. I haven't listened to anything besides Love Yourself: Tear since it's release which is saying something because I have several playlists that are typically 300+ songs (my K-pop mix spans over 500 :$).

&amp;nbsp;

My next goal would be to go to one of their concerts within the next 3 years, even if it's alone, though seems nearly impossible. Thanks for reading. Feels good to share this.",3,6
