SUGA said during their [Beatles Code](https://youtu.be/eixeUaVQQqM)  interview that they are not interested in this type of friendship,  but it's been 3 years since that. So I was wondering if anything changed because apparently  Jin is friends(or at least familiar) with Moonbyul (Mamamoo) and Hani(EXID) because they're part of the 92 club (with Sandeul and Ken). Also, EXID's Hyerin and J-Hope are friends because they used to go to the same dance school(?). And then there's the new friendship between SUGA and Suran as well. Do they have any other friends/acquaintances among female idols? ",33,18
9,2017-6-1,2017,6,1,15,6eky4k,Does the fandom still see the boys as underdogs?: A Discussion,ABlackUnicorn,1496298094,"Hey everyone! I was browsing the thread about The Wings Tour grossing over $2 milly in Sydney, and it brought up an interesting question for me that I'd love to discuss with you all: do ARMYs still think of the boys as underdogs? Have any of you ceased believing that? If so, when did that happen? If not, what do you think has to happen yet?

It's my belief that the fandom in general still tends to think of them this way- correct me if I'm wrong!- and if so I think it's because it's easy to do so and it's only in the past year and some change that they've had serious traction. I mean, we are so in love with their success story: from a small company, were literally starving artists in the beginning, lived in a tiny dorm, had a tiny office space, etc etc. I think that on some level we're really comfortable with that narrative because it illustrates how passionate, hard-working, and humble the boys are. However, I wonder- is that the narrative still? Just in terms of how much they're struggling. And so while we can (and *should*) continue to tout their incredible work ethic, down-to-earth nature, and always their heartwarming humility...they're like, solidly in the ""Now We're Here"" side, right, as in, they started from the bottom...don't you think? It's clear that I'm talking strictly money, but maybe you all have other criteria by which you would judge them as having ""made it""? I'd love to know what those are!

This is certainly not a discussion meant to convince anyone to think of them differently or feel guilty for continuing to think of them as either not or having already made it- I'm just curious to know your thoughts! Thanks :)",41,60

Is BTS any different in that respect? From a PR perspective how do you think they would handle it as both a company and the members themselves? Do you see the team nature of their SNS accounts being a protective factor? And do you think their friendly relationship with reporters and members of the media has helped to prevent anything from leaked thus far?",54,42

Im sorry for how late this is, but I was fortunate enough to attend the BBMAs and want to share the experience with you! For the sake of cohesiveness, Ive broken it up into sections so if youre more interested in one aspect of the day/night than another, you can jump around. :)



**Camping out before the livestream**

5:00-8:00am For weeks prior, attending Army were organizing in a fb group, and the admin suggested we meet at the T-Mobile Arena at 5am. We couldnt be on the carpet itself because that was invitation only, but we *could* be in a designated fan area opposite the entrance to the carpet. The sun started rising as I was making my way into Vegas at 5, and by the time I arrived at 5:20 the sun was up, and there were already over 100 people! For the first 2-3 hours we stood in a fan-organized line, writing our names in a notebook and getting a number written on our hands. No one knew how this would work, but some of the fb admins had spoken with security, were told our line would be honored, and that more instructions would come at 7am.  Its impossible to say if anyone there *wasn't* ARMY, but most of us were. Everyone was happy and generally excited! Most people talked with their friends or people in line near them.

8:00-9:00am 7am came and left with no new instructions. Eventually, as newer arrivals showed up and stood near the entrance to the carpet our line devolved into a blob, mixing up people who were there early and others who were just showing up. This is when things got lit and people started playing BTS songs on their speakers and doing fan chants. We were just entertaining ourselves because there wasnt much to watch in front of us yet. At this point the blob of people was only 4 rows deep and still mostly Army. The spotlights above the carpet entrance were turned on.

9:00am This was one of the most active hours during the wait. Railing went up across the street and in front of us. We kept getting filmed by various personalities for their SNS (such as hosts [AJ Gibson](https://twitter.com/AJGibson/status/866358748192792576) and [Emile Ennis Jr.](https://twitter.com/EmileEnnisJr/status/866332665909092354)) and other cameras. Haha, the employees setting up across the street kept looking at us.  We figured people were confused/amazed by us because we were early, large, organized, and dedicated. We were also filmed by three presumably Korean gentlemen. Honestly, anytime a camera came by we just screamed and/or chanted. [This compilation video accurately represents the atmosphere.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-N6tD5_DG8&amp;list=LLJQzDim5wEg838jO4jjj4vw&amp;index=13) A lot of people started sitting down to rest, and the fb admins passed around chips and water that they brought for us.

10:00am A crowd of workers in all black arrived. Non-Armys started trickling in. There was still a lot of filming, yelling, and singing going on.

12:00pm At 12:30 men in magenta ties arrived. At 12:40 the railing opposite us got removed and the carpet was done being taped down.

1:00pm By 1, we were hitting the 96 F/35.5 C high for the day. We felt cramped, thirsty, sweaty, smelly, but kept singing. A number of smart people started breaking out their umbrellas. Id moved forward to the 3rd row earlier when security adjusted the railing but whereas that would have been the back of the mass before, there were now 6 additional rows behind me!
Dispatch arrived at 1:14 and started filming Army. Between then and 1:17 [THEY TOOK THE LEGENDARY PIC OF THE MEMEKOOK POSTER.](https://dispatch.cdnser.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bc8bbe49a0dcfc9e85fbcbc930dc5951.jpg) Soon after that people started arriving and posing in front of the Billboard sign. The people invited to watch from on the carpet also filled in.
By 1:52, everyone was reenergized and standing. Wed stopped singing for a while, but with the excitement started up again and did occasional fan chants. At this point wed been singing/chanting/screaming intermittently for random camera shots at the urging of employees across the street and for personal but BTS related SNS posts all day. Id started to get dumb and loopy under the sun and muttered that I stan the breeze, but apparently others were fans too because they started stanning the breeze with me, hehe.
Someone with a sense of humor (I think it was host AJ?) thought it would be fun to tease Army. He came by and told us he was sitting next to BTSand asked if we were jealous.   Haha if youve heard the [sound of a howling puppy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ainzK7QuseU&amp;t=5s), you know what our screaming at him sounded like. *We knew* he was teasing but it still made our hearts go *boom boom*. 

2:00pm We got filmed saying it was the 2017 Billboard Music Awards. Nothing was happening but people occasionally broke out into random BTS chants for no reason or at the arrival of a car, and others of us asked them to stop in an attempt at being respectful. The random chanting was more of a morning/9am thing, not as the event was about to get underway. 2:25 E! News arrived and filmed us cheering. The heat intensified. Id evolved from human to my final form as a pile of sunblock, but more than 2 Army around me started suffering from heat exhaustion. We provided them shade from umbrellas and our water, and made space for them to sit. An ambulance had been at the scene earlier but I didnt catch what that was about.

The takeaway: Check the weather before an event like this and take extra precautions. Being used to a climate doesnt mean the same as being able to spend 11 hours in it with a similar degree of comfort throughout. Umbrellas are severely underrated as portable shade, wet wipes are an easy way and convenient way to freshen up, and its possible for a pair of daily veteran flip flops to hurt after much &lt;11 hours. A lot of people also said this was worse than waiting in the concert lines because we were up against one another. Do as you wish with this info.



**The start of the Magenta Carpet and BTSs arrival**

3pm. It was finally time for the livestream to start. Almost on the dot a white stretch hummer rolled up. I was kind of tuning out because it was hot and thought it was just another carbut someone next to me pointed out the security coming toward us. I snapped to attention and looked in front of me for other signs. Some people had been speculating that they would make BTS walk last so that the crowd wouldnt disappearALL I KNEW WAS I WAS HOT AND TIRED AND HOPED THIS WASNT TRUE BECAUSE I COULDNT CONCEIVE STANDING 1:30 MORE HOURS OF THIS. I had finished my water about an hour ago and had chosen to stand the whole time to take advantage of small shifts in the crowd and get closer. All the umbrellas were down so we could see and take pictures, but now we were getting hit with the full force of the sun. Butwhos to know how they decide to run these things right? 

But then*THEN* I see Dispatch get into position. And holy mother of music that means it can only be them, right!??!!! I was trying to keep my footing stable because someone kept pushing on my right, but all I was thinking about was deciding where to look. Since it was a white stretch hummer all views were blocked and no one would be visible until they came around the side. I didnt think it was worth trying to look through the tinted windows and wanted to be ready to see whoever came out. People opposite us on the carpet were in a frenzy but we couldnt see who it was. AND THEN MONIE CAME AROUND THE CARS CORNER AND ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. When he turned around to face us he was wearing his cute but shy tight lip-dimple smile and waved shyly. It was like he was happy but unsure and testing the waters.

Oh my godso I unintentionally described this moment on the discord at the end of the night and it became permanently etched in my brain. At the expense of anything else. What happened next??? **I dont know???** All I have is this one glorious moment of him and his brilliant smile. ^Hes^my^bias^its^kinda^okay. I think Kookie appeared at his side next??? All I remember is a slim profile and a shoulder. Am I wishfully creating a memory of him turning and waving to us as I write this, or was it the real thing?? Ive avoided all footage in order to write this first ^so^I^dont^know.

My brain didnt know how to function. It was thinking thoughts but they were only half formed and half conscious. It sank in hours after I got home. My brain: They are right in front of me. I sat P1 in Anaheim and saw their real life faces up close then. So why is this any different? Why am I telling myself to make sure I appreciate their real life presence and their beauty so intently? Answer: Because P1 was close, closer than Id ever thought Id be, *but this is even closer than that. This is probably the new limit of how close youll ever be to them.* *insert jhope_cri* 

There was so much screaming and people were pushing forward. Other members got out of the car. Like Monie, the rest of BTS seemed cautious too, walking over to the Billboard sign slightly hesitantly. [Little dumb me finally took out her phone and started taking pictures,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ZeYCG4hF4&amp;t=17s) but I didnt have a clear view through the mass of security and photographers. Over all they looked shy at times, but in between poses they seemed happy, free, and like they were having the time of their lives laughing, smiling, and messing around with one another. NOW THAT WE HAD SEEN THEM, *PHEW*, we were able to calm down a bit and alternately screamed and chanted until they walked down the carpet, out of sight. 

OH MY GOSH BLESSED ARE THE STARS ABOVE FOR MAKING THEM FIRST. I dont know *how* many, but a good number of Army left once they were gone. Some of them showed up just for the carpet, but others of us were going to the show too. As soon as Army left, non-kpopers pressed forward and took their place. Turns out we didnt need to worry; the non-kpopers were screaming loudly and consistently. But even though their screaming was loud and crazed, it felt lesspassionate and unified? Might have been just me Anyway, the carpet was moving quickly but I decided I was *done* with the heat and left to freshen up for the show.



**The Show**

I had P3 tickets in section 221 to the right of the stage; many Army were concentrated in sections 213 and 219 to my left. Im SO glad another [r/bangtan user was there](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6clso8/fan_account_bbmas_2017/) and that our accounts can complement each others because I could see general BTS antics, but not much else. They jammed hardest to Nicki Minaj, and secondly to the Chainsmokers. I was really hoping to see some cute BTSxballoon interactions following Mileys performance, but the audience was told to pop them all during the following commercial break. *sigh* 

Several performances and commercial breaks later, Logan Paul and Lindsey Sterling got on stage. I KNEW WHAT THIS MEANT. Phone and emotions were at the ready.and you guys know the rest. [:)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m9Vkj_YveM) Haha we all knew it was game over once they announced the winner had over 300,000,000 votes before even going over the nominees. GG Billboard. youve heard the screaming in various videos, right? Right? We had no chill. In the fb group, the mods created a seating chart listing the rows and sections of  123 attendees, 12 DAYS BEFORE THE SHOW. This didnt include people who purchased tickets after that date or others who didnt check in. Suffice it to say, there were a lot of us in an arena that carried sound really well.

Once they announced itit was incredible. There was so much screaming. I cant even tell you how much because I was screaming my lungs out, lost in my own yells and happiness. During the speech, I looked at the screen instead of them because I was too busy screaming to focus in and needed to see their faces. I know I missed a lot the speech, and Im so glad the televised recording captured it. We tried not to scream over Monie but it was hard because we were too happy and excited and didnt know where breaks in his speech would be. It was beautiful because Army was happy and the boys were happy. And that was all that mattered because we did it.

They were quite the social butterflies when they got back to their seats. Twice during commercial breaks, one of the sections with a concentrated amount of Army chanted BTS. It was the third and last one after the award that was the loudest and most successful. The chant started in the same place, but this time more of us joined in and it grew until surprised, BTS turned and waved to us. In the moment, I felt they looked surprised, happy, and a tiny bit embarrassed and unsure of what to do. Haha it felt as if they were wondering and hoping that their waving would settle us down. 

Because I knew fan sites and other fans with better cameras were there, I decided not to stare at them every second (settled for every couple seconds) and enjoy the show. It was so different from seeing them in concert and I wasnt expecting that. At their concerts, they are there putting on a show for us, and we are *supposed* to be looking at them. But here, *they* are the ones sitting and enjoying the show, watching artists they admire live. As much as I love them, its hard to ignore the stage and it was a show I was there for too. It felt strange but so nice because it was like there was a comradery between us as concert goers, since in this moment we were both *fans* enjoying the same thing together. 

Most importantly though, is that seeing their antics  no matter how brief or how far  I really truly feel they were happy. They were as happy at the show as they were on the carpet, in the mass of tweets leading up to this, and in all the post-show interviews.  We did it guys.  &lt;3

But I suspect that preparing for a concert would take a lot of time so I'm not really sure if they can hold another concert tour, which got me thinking that they might do a fanmeet instead. What do you think of BTS holding a fanmeet? Would it be better if they do a concert instead? Also, I wonder if they're going back to the US, will they still attend MAMA and Melon Awards?

92,2017-6-4,2017,6,4,9,6f4fh2,A Trip Down BTS Memory Lane: Ver. 2,dorkprincess,1496534798,"Hey guys! Some of you might remember the [first version of this thread I made around 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5mz4fl/a_trip_down_bts_memory_lane/), but I think enough time has passed and enough new fans have joined the fandom that doing something like this would be worth it again.  

**Rules:** post your favorite videos or interviews of BTS that a newer fan might not have seen; the limit I'm going to enact this time is it can't be from YNWA era. I'd also suggest you don't choose extremely well-known and quoted videos; a good guideline for what is a ""well-known"" video is anything within the [first half of my ""Welcome, first time with BTS?""](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeVfMfa1HAgmraLfEl8kwEDesUpXJY9hN) Youtube playlist.  

I'd also highly, highly suggest checking back through the first thread and avoid repeating answers from that! New fans should read through it too to find more content ;)  

**My picks:**  

* [BTS User Standee Manual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vvd69TifSu4&amp;feature=youtu.be)  
* [2015 MMA Performance w/ the Iron Man glove things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q8mLVHzi98)

I recently studied abroad in Thailand and that's how I heard of BTS, after a couple weeks of playing around with their content I found myself becoming a dedicated fan in no time (how could I not with these 7 angels performing their hearts out?) I'm going into my third university year and will be 21 soon. After reading some Youtube comments and such things, I noticed many discussing their ages to be 15 or 16. Is this the age of most ARMYs? I couldn't help but feel a little old, but surely there is an older crowd  that is maybe a bit quieter? 

(p.s. None of my friends are into BTS so I've really enjoyed getting updates and talking on this subreddit! Also, in 5 months I still haven't been able to choose a bias T_T)

Sorry this is super long but I tried to make it really detailed and give the feel of the whole concert, if you get me??? My fancams are linked throughout, I just copy pasted this from what I wrote on the 27th! (I apologise for my language)

~

Okay, so, fuck. Its about 12:20pm while Im writing this in the state library lmao so Im feeling really _removed_ from the experience right now but lets DO THIS. This is a fan account of the whole day, not just the concert btw. Also!! Big props for @bts_aus on the day as their admins worked so hard and made the best out of a shitty organisers bad situation!!!!

So I went with my best friend and we were like fuck yeah we got VIP Centre were gonna get there early as shit and get barrier. Not the case, my friends. People started lining up on _Wednesday_. The concert was on Friday night. We got there at 5:30am and were still about 120th in line for our section. I cant even express how many people were there.

The day went pretty fast, even though we were sitting on the ground for about 12 hours. There were a _lot_ of fansites there, and true to Australian nature people would literally run across the outside of the stadium from fansite line to fansite line without actually knowing whose goods they were. I had to suffer through a (white) middle aged woman walking past me and telling me Its J-Hope goods, if youre okay with that. Woman, I am more than okay with that. I would buy the entire stall just to make you shut up I am THAT okay with that. I ended up not buying any fansite goods because I only had $15 cash and the one thing I wanted sold out. The alternative was a photobook for $48 that was like 1.5cm thick, which I couldnt afford as much as I wanted it.

The organisers were SO disorganised. There was no water allowed in the venue, ALL bags had to be cloaked if you were in standing. Queue numbers were only given out around 11:30 (instead of 8, as previously told). In the end they didnt actually check which number you had, which meant you could technically have jumped into the 10s if you wanted. This meant there was only about 3 hours where you didnt have to be at the stadium, and then we spent 2 hours waiting to get into the arena, and another 2 hours waiting for the concert to start. Genuinely dont know how I did it.

They played all the MVs on the small screen while we waited, and then finally played Spring Day on the small screens &amp; the fabric screen covering the stage. Then they went into a VCR which I genuinely cant remember much of because I was still low-key in disbelief. One thing I DO remember about the VCRs is that they generally connected all of the HYYH concepts into one, which was great. What was not so great is that they could possibly have taken the high road and been like ~it was a journey~ instead of, you know, actually giving us an answer to the plot. But Im not pressed. Im extremely excited for the DVD to come out and watch the VCRs again, because they were so breathtaking and the boys looked SO GOOD in all of them.

They started with Not Today which. lit. I was about 4 rows back in VIP C which meant I was in front of the extended stage, and this was on the main stage. Still was disassociating a little. Then Am I Wrong, which honestly I hate so Im glad they got that out of the way lmaoo they better drop that from the setlist at the next concert. Then it was Silver Spoon / , Dope, Begin, Lie, and First Love on the main stage. Because it was on the main stage they were like, little blurs and you had to watch them on the screen, so I seriously still felt like I was hallucinating a little lol. Im a bit sad they performed Silver Spoon on the main stage but I still got to see Hobis dance break and like, almost had a heart attack watching his hip thrusts. So the main stage was probably better for my health.

Begin was really good, and it was only at this concert that it struck me how young Jungkook is? Because we only watch them on screens, you sort of dont think of them as real people? It was like, oh yeah Jungkook is my age but hes not real so that doesnt matter. HES REAL. HES OUT THERE. He has much more of a baby face in real life but the contrast with his eyes. Guys. My Dudes. Jungkook has the most piercing eyes Ive seen in my entire life. The number of times I swerved for him in this concert???? Unreal. Im not someone who watches a lot of fancams, and generally pay a lot of attention to Hobi in any performance (This is a trend that will continue through this fan acc). I hadnt watched any fancams of Begin so like. Fuck. Jungkook is a _really good dancer_. I knew this already but seeing it in person and not on a tiny screen in 30fps made me realise just how sharp &amp; precise, but also so natural his moves are. If you havent watched a fancam for Begin yet, I suggest you do so, because the footwork in that does _not_ look easy, and yet he nailed it so fucking well.

Ill be honest I dont have much to say about Lie because it was on the main stage and I was still a little convinced nothing was real. What I can say is that Jimins voice is absolutely incredible. I know we talk a little about how BTS need proper vocal training (which they do) but I thought it was really obvious how much his voice has improved since recording Lie (probably in September 2016) - it didnt seem as strained, he wasnt out of breath at all. The entire performance was gorgeous, especially when the dancers lifted him above their heads.

First Love: Same deal, main stage, mental confusion. I literally dont remember much BUT. At the end (?) of the song, theres a moment where he (Suga) essentially just stands there with dramatic music playing in the background and like looks out at the crowd.  Something I need to mention here, the merch stand got _cancelled_. There was no merch. At all. This meant that most people were planning on buying ARMY bombs at the concert (shipping to Australia is $50 + your unborn child), and therefore there were very little bombs in the crowd. We made up for this with loudness. This was also their first concert after winning their BBMA award.) We screamed SO LOUD.  So hes looking out at the crowd, and actually looked so fucking emotional. Not crying but like, you know when youre holding back tears and your face crumples weirdly? Like your eyebrow twitches, you quirk the side of your mouth a little, blink a bit. He was doing that. I cant explain it well but I genuinely think he was really moved by the crowd that night.

Okay, LOST ([fancam](https://twitter.com/highcrisis/status/868316690773192704)). They finally come out on the extended stage. This is already long as fuck, I know, but Im doing it for my European friends who havent seen them. It was only at this point that I had that _holy shit theyre real people that are right there_ moment. The first thing that really struck me was how attractive Jin is. Like, I know hes attractive already, but his hair was styled up for the entire concert and dear lord. A Man. In photos I feel like his cheeks (?) come out a little pudgy, and his eyes sort of ??? I dont know. But in real life hes definitely I dont want to say chiselled. But chiselled. MUCH stronger features, exponentially more attractive than photos make him look.  This was also when we got to see the maknae line (Jimin, Jungkook, Taehyung) who are the resident panty droppers in BTS. Ill be honest, I didnt pay much attention to Jimin the entire concert (this is 100% because I was too busy looking at Hobi), but I paid enough attention to notice this - his dancing is so dramatic. _So_ dramatic. He exaggerates his moves a lot, drops lower, jumps higher, movesmore in general than the other members do. This isnt a bad thing though; it makes him entertaining to watch because I love his dramatic ass. Jungkook, once again. Probably the most stage presence in this song at least, and his eyes. Again. His Eyes. [insert the next day snakes invaded my house' meme].

Save Me.[ MY FANCAM](https://twitter.com/highcrisis/status/868317570205536257). The song where I got to see Jung Hobi / J-Hope Hoseok actually in Front Of My Eyes. BUT THE THING IS, I DIDNT EVEN LOOK AT HIM FIRST. I LOOKED AT NAMJOON. Guys honestly. Jin / Namjoon (+J-Hope) are recognised as the members with the least fans in BTS, but those two. Fuck. They are so fucking handsome in person I genuinely couldnt take my eyes off them. Like, I literally remember looking at Jin and thinking about how big a crush I would have had on him if he went to my high school. Namjoon in general smiled so much when he was dancing oh my god HES THE MOST HANDSOME MAN I EVER SAW. All the members looked like they were enjoying themselves so much the entire concert I felt like Id drank 10 energy drinks and wasnt a human sardine in the pit.

Oh god, okay, I need to talk about Hoseok. If youre reading this on reddit, you dont know that Hoseok is my Ult To End All Ults. I dont have biases in other groups because whats the point when none of them are Him. A lot of fan accounts talk about how much more attractive he is in person, but thats most likely because if youre not a Hobi stan you dont pay as much attention to him (ergo, lesser popular member). I subscribed to the church of Jung Hoseok over a year ago, so I know _exactly_ how attractive he can be and god bless I asked and the lord delivered. Jung Hoseok is a sunbeam. He smiled _constantly_, and if you dont know what his smile looks like take a look. Ive literally never felt happier than I did when I first saw him smile in front of me. Hes exactly the same in person as he is in videos. Hes embarrassing, funny, cute, happy, cringey, sweet, emotional. Objectively, his facial features definitely are more fine in person (with the exception of his 120 jawline which a bitch nearly cried over). BUT BACK TO IT.

I Need U really shocked me, because of where I was standing I couldnt see the floor of the stage and was like oh lol theyre gone but like, they were just lying on the floor lmaoo I have to find a fancam of this because the moment Hobis part started I screamed _so loudly_ even the crazy bitches in front of me were like what the fuck. The only parts I remember (Im sorry) of this song were the parts were Hobi is in the centre, which arguably are the best in any case. Sorry fam.

Reflection. The best. Song. I love it. The entire performance is great and I kinda want to marry Namjoon but the highlight of it was definitely the end - the end of the song is him repeating I wish I could love myself, I wish I could love myself but after each repeat the entire crowd, the _ENTIRE CROWD _shouted WE LOVE YOU and god damn it was so incredibly loud and he looked so pleased oh god what a night.

Stigma. This performance was beautiful, and he genuinely hit every single note. Im fairly convinced theyve all received more/better vocal training since the release of Wings, because even Taehyung sounded a lot more steady and confident in his falsetto.

[MAMA. MAMAMAMAMAMAMAMAMAMA](https://twitter.com/highcrisis/status/868317866545733632) Look honestly the choreo in this is nice, the song is really good and I love jung hoseoks voice but the absolute highlight of this song is over 3 and a half minutes of seeing Hobi absolutely radiate with happiness. When you see fansite pics of them smiling I feel like your mind (or mine at least) is like thats a really nice pic of them smiling as if smiling is like, something that comes and goes (which it does). If smiling comes and goes, Jung Hoseok doesnt smile. His entire being radiates positivity. He is _always_ smiling and looking happy his eyes shine his body language is so open. Jesus chrsit. Anyways I took a fancam, it shakes around really fast at one point because my dumb ass started waving at him while recording.

Awake. An entire 4 minutes of swerving for Jin if Im honest. I have to talk about their improvement in vocals, like really. Comparing what I heard last night to what I hear in the official track, Jins voice is already so much less strained than it used to be. A lot more whole? The opposite of strained, in any case. It sounded so natural and healthy. My fancam. Just before I took the fancam, he hit this note and I swear to god my soul left my body. Like I really cannot express the different between seeing Jin in photos or singing in videos and him singing right in front of you. If everyone could see him live he would be one of the most popular members without a doubt. His voice is beautiful, his face is beautiful, the stage was beautiful. Everything.

Cypher 4 okay now bitch dont even talk to me about this stage I have not slept peacefully SINCE jung hoseok came for me and everything I hold dear Im gonna leave my fancam ([pt 1](https://twitter.com/highcrisis/status/868318375251857408), [pt 2](https://twitter.com/highcrisis/status/868319162635927554)) give 3 points and go.

1. Before Namjoons rap they did a bit of rapping which I couldnt hear but it was still lit. Namjoons part was SO GOOD
2. jugn hoseujok
3. CLICK CLACK TO THE BANG FUCK YOU ADN YOU

Oh my fucking god this is such a long fan account. At some point between Awake and Cypher I picked an army bomb up off the ground so like, that was lit. (I meant to give it in to lost &amp; found but as I will say later I practically fainted in the pit, my friend did too, so we like chilled out for about 20 minutes in the venue trying to feel our limbs, and then I had to scam my way into the front of the cloak room line)

Then there was fire (3:33 was lit) and a medley of N.O, No More Dream, Boy In Luv, Danger, Run, and ?? another one I think. I just remember flipping my shit during Run because the entire crowd was jumping and I think I found nirvana. Run was the first BTS comeback I experienced so it has a special place in my heart. Its also sort of overshadowed by being in between Dope and Fire. Underrated god tier song. (You can leave N.O. at the door tho lmao)

21st Century Girl, Boy Meets Evil, and Blood Sweat and Tears were both on the main stage so not many thoughts on those, I pretty much took the time to actually stand properly (Id been on my tip toes for the entire concert) and just chill watching the screens. Unfortunately, this was also the time where I decided to almost faint and had to stumble out of the pit. (For reference, remember how I said no water bottles were allowed inside? No cups of water were handed out in the pit, the asshole security guards decided to squirt water into peoples mouths from water bottles, and ignore those who were more than 3 rows back. I was sweating so much sweat was literally running into my mouth).

So I went to the back of the section, sat down for about a minute, stood up to get some water, and then waited for the encore to start. I havent talked about the ments yet - they were really cute. Jin called himself Mr Worldwide Handsome which was ridiculously funny. I think its really important to stress that like, everyone Ive talked to is like theyre exactly how I imagined them. They mess around on stage, before songs started I caught them making dumb faces at each other, Jin and Jungkook really are as funny as were led to believe. Jimin, Suga, and Jungkooks english was all really cute, Id say 90% of it was all scripted (except for Namjoon, whose speeches seemed so incredibly genuine.) but there were a few times where a member would say something obviously not scripted and the rest of them would be like, jesus fucking christ (Jin. Im talking about Jin.).

Outro: Wings was SO FUN. Im glad I wasnt in the pit anymore, because you had such limited vision tbh. From the back I could see all of them interacting with the crowd, which is a must for Outro. My fancam~~ (Also, the sydney concert is when this was filmed)

Then they had their last ment. I talked about ments just then, so now Im gonna talk about how Hobi looked really quiet and emotional tbh not to be that person but I know him like the back of my hand, and he was obviously really touched by the crowd.

Then there was 2,3 ([fancam](https://twitter.com/highcrisis/status/868318969957982208)) and Spring Day, and lets not fuck around here I cried for the last 10 minutes of the concert. The crowd was so loud during the end songs, and the absolute best part was when they were bowing during the end part of Spring Day, and the entire arena was singing the ooOOOOoo oooOOOOoo parts of the song from the MV.

I dont think I really have anything else to say lol but now I have Primary Evidence for anyone who tries to tell me they arent the most genuine bunch of boys out there",12,37

How has the month/era during which you discovered BTS affected your ARMY journey?

I joined after Save Me (without actually watching Save Me D:), and after a week spent learning their names, I had the entire summer to explore BTS. They were gone for several months after Save Me, so there was a fairly low amount of newly released content. It meant I had to wait around 5 months before experiencing my first comeback, and by then I had already fallen in deep and knew most of their Bombs by heart. But at the same time, ARMYs didnt seem very active during the summer, and the ARMY Amino app was only one month old so aside from replying to YouTube comments I had no idea how to talk to other ARMYs. I didn't know BTS had a presence on Twitter either, and there weren't any interviews from news sources that I followed, so I just sort of went with whatever the ""recommended"" bar said and gradually learned about their history through comments on old videos.

Pros: had an ENTIRE summer to learn about BTS, got to experience Blood Sweat &amp; Tears whole journey from 0M to 100M, was able to discuss WINGS theories with everyone, all the videos were already subbed, watched their first and second Daesang awards live!

Cons: waiting longer for comeback, fewer bombs during the summer, missing Festa, most of the HYYH theories were already written, missed the records set by Fire, thrust into end-of-year voting without anyone helping me learn about it beforehand

Namjoon is not my ult bias (I can't believe I even need to say this) but I think he is genuinely one of the most deeply thinking and poetic people I've ever seen in my life. He speaks eloquently, does what he wants with his life, and analyzes every little detail. As a result, you get one of the most interesting and deeply thinking people in the idol world.



I've never met someone else that shares What Am I To You as their favorite song. Not only do I like it because of Namjoon's beautiful voice, but the story and the way he folds it out in front of you is very interesting. In the beginning, he indicates this happened in his school days by playing a school bell and teenage-like chatter (which I have a question about, a little further down in this long post), in which he talks light-heartedly and happily, like the ecstasy everyone feels in the beginning of a relationship. But as the song progresses (and as [Bighit's teaser of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3OLpHsAR54) shows), Namjoon divulges and reveals more about the toxic nature of his previous relationship. You can sense the anger in his voice, picture him ripping through the lyrics in the recording studio with his hands balled. It gives me shivers thinking about the toxicity he had to face.



If you read the lyrics as you listen to the song, pay attention to when the beat backs off [at 1:16,](https://youtu.be/_3OLpHsAR54?t=1m16s) and picture 16-18 year old Namjoon, at the beginning stages of being his inquisitive self going through these things, it can change you from seeing him (and possibly Bangtan in general) as an idol to an actual person.




With this, I have a question to ask. In the beginning of the song, it sounds like a typical school environment, but as the bell rings, a voice that sounds very similar to Jimin's says something along the lines of (if my elementary level Korean serves me well), "" !""(Ah suddenly!) which definitely was included for a specific reason. So my question is: 1) is it Jimin saying this? and 2) Does what this mysterious voice said hold any significance in the song? I'm sure Namjoon wouldn't just randomly pick this sound byte among all the others he had to choose from in order to ""set the scene"" (as that is, surely, what the significance of playing this school-like chatter is).",38,52

Do you think BTS wants success in the US/Western market?

Should they collaborate with American/Western artists?

Should they perform on American television? And if yes, which shows?

As an American. I would love to see a KPop artist legitimately succeed here. More than just a viral sensation like Psy was.

The impression I get from Bang PD and the boys is - They have no interest in putting out an English language album or to specifically cater to the Western market; BUT they would love US chart success doing music their way in their native language.

Although they do seem open to US collaborations if they feel the chemistry is right.

I believe Billboard success has always been a dream for the boys. Hell, Suga put in one of his songs. He also specifically said he wants a song to chart on the Billboard Hot  that they sing in Korean.

So, if that is a dream of theirs, then how do you think they should set out to make that happen?

I think 2 things need to happen. 1) A killer performance on a major US award show or a popular TV show. 2) A US collaboration that gets them significant radio play.

This is old (5 Jun) stuff, but I just want to squeal over how BTS told all their Chinese ARMYs to study well (see above link) and how EXACTLY it reflects their comfort level with other languages.

Suga BUTCHERED IT. I love him so much, but he absolutely murdered it. The best part about Suga is that he says the last two words quite well! So, he's saying a sort of four-word Chinese idiom, and he pronounces the last two words pretty perfectly decently! It's like when RapMon said ""Ah, they don't know any English"", and Suga just rattled out a perfect line about how he met Machine Gun Kelly. Suga generally HITS IT MAD FAR whenever he's got a good line, he's rehearsed it, he's prepared. He's a one-line shock deliverer. (I bet he's like that in Korean too.) So here, Suga says the first two words in an absolUTELY MISERABLE FASHION, I can't understand a word, I don't, helpless, and then he rattles off the last two words with the diction of a native speaker. I just. Min Suga.

PARK JIMIN MY LIFE. HE'S SO CUTE. HELP ME. So he does it in the typical Jimin way, he pauses, and he tries to compensate for his lack of accuracy by being cute to gain appeal points (IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY but it totally works) (I'm quite serious about this.)(This is an actual strategy I have observed Jimin using.)(Many people do.)(It's perfect.)(He's perfect.) As usual, Jimin overthinks everything and even though he's spot on for the word pronunciation (which Suga wasn't, Suga was like, ""help that child"", ""he's drowning""), Jimin's messing up the intonation (sort of the sing-song quality pronunciation) which you would give to the Chinese characters, he's pronouncing it in the most textbook way possible, but also in the deadest way possible. It's just void of the usual, everyday inflection which normal people give to the words. It's just, it's so JIMIN in how he studies so hard (because he did, he's really good with the actual sounds minus tone) and how he tries so hard sometimes he can't just let himself go and feel the emotion and tone the way that Jungkook is so good at.

kiM TAEHYUNG OH GOD THAT OH KILL ME Okay so Taehyung. You know how Korean people say regularly (and now that I'm learning Korean, I really do understand this) that Taehyung has an accent? Oh god. It's so accent. It's so accent. It's so thick and garble-muffled. He sounds like he stuck a giant soft compressible fluff ball in his mouth and is trying to talk around it without licking it. He's perfect, by the way. He's absolutely NAILED IT BRILLIANT, both the pronunciation, the tone. It's just, oh god, the accent, it's so thick I could bite it and have to chew five times to swallow, you have no idea how accent he is. I hesitate on calling it country - because I know what country sounds like. You know country people. This is not country people. This is, like, city people, with a weird way of talking. It sounds very unique, whereas country people all speak with the same kind of lilt. Whereas you totally can't predict where his voice will go, even though when you hear it, you're like, yeah, that's consistent with how he spoke before.

kIM TAEHYUNGGGGGGGG speaking to me with the cutest thickest most garble-warble-muffled accent in the world I want to smother him with pillows. Combine this accent with his unusual way of talking, and you realise why Taehyung is so beloved by older hyungs. He's just. You're just like ""awww you're mangling my language but IN SUCH A CUTE WAY I SQUISH YOU"" and he does this in English too, of course! I thought it was just his English accent slowly kicking in, but IT'S KIM TAEHYUNG ALL THE WAY.

Fucking golden maknae. Native Chinese speaker right there. I'm not even joking. I was giggling in adoration at Tae and then this fucker just blew my mood stone cold. He speaks that phrase better than me. He definitely looks better than me while speaking it. He speaks it so fast and fluidly that it's over.

Dude you guys don't understand. I watched Jimin twice and Tae twice because I needed to watch the cuteness. I rewinded Kook twice because I needed to ASSERT MY IDENTITY. I swear to you, I whispered ""fucking golden maknae"" in shock when I heard him. I had to establish dominance, I had to rewind and check for mistakes. There were no mistakes. It's perfect. He's perfect. Someone punch this golden maknae, life is unfair.

Okay, I guess just like in English, Kook has a natural gift for the flow of stuff. You know what I mean? Like, he's really good at picking up the gist, the flow, the natural-like rhythm of what something is supposed to be. Kind of like the saxophone thing. So he may not know what he's saying, he's definitely a little tiny bit off in the emphasis (like, he's got the tone and pronunciation right, but if you were saying those four words in isolation, you'd say them with slightly different emphasis. I think I'd go deeper in emphasis on word 1, and more high pitched, veering off, cheerful~^ emphasis on word 4.) But goddamn golden maknae, he's clearly repeating from a native speaker because you wouldn't emphasize like that by yourself, it's unnatural, but you also WOULDN'T EMPHASIZE LIKE THAT BY YOUSELF it's fucking insane native.

Golden maknae.

Jin has flair. He's older, he knows what he's saying, he's got what Kook lacks. He's got exactly the right pitch on the key words. You know how he does the ""I th~ink I a~m wor~ldwide hAndsome."" and the English sound is a little weird, but his deadpan delivery on EXACTLY the right pauses and the right kind of casualness which a native would give makes it so hilarious. He's got a natural flair for passing off a line, sounding a little weird, but ultimately with the mature kind of pauses that a learning adult would make, with a lot of cute youthfulness. Like, lemme make clear, no one is mistaking Jin for a native. Not today, not yesterday. Honestly? Not for a while, and that's fine. I mean, just Bangtan your way through life. I love that. But unless he puts in serious work, nah. But his natural gift for knowing where to turn a line, knowing how to deliver, carries him really well. Plus, on a word-by-word basis, Jin understands much more about what he's saying at any given moment, more than anybody except Namjoon. Suga kind of - strings together the realest sounding phrases, and delivers them perfetto. But without adequate preparation, and the right question, Suga can't do it. Suga delivers phrases. Jin delivers the whole sentence, complete with the native feel.

HOLY SHIT J-HOPE. I thought Kook was the best. Hope BLEW HIM OUT OF THE WATER. Hope's intonation is perfect, hook, line, sinker. It reminds me of how Namjoon asked everyone to say ""Girl"" and Hope won and everyone was surprised. (I was surprised.) But not anymore nope. Hope is officially, in my eyes, the second best at languages in Bangtan. (Fuck off, golden maknae. You're in a different category don't compete here.)(Okay but honestly, Kook is just too young for me to tell how good he is at languages.)(He might be good.)(He might be not.)(Right now HE SHOWS NO FLAWS BUT YOUTH.)(So I don't know if he makes mistakes because?? young??)(Or because REAL FLAW I WAIT IN ANTICIPATION)(Kook never change I love you so)

But seriously tho J-HOPEEE holy crying cripes that was perfect. I have nothing. Everything was perfect. From the facial expression to the gesture, to the word sounds, everything syncs up together to be perfect. This reminds me of what Namjoon said on his vlive before the BTS Billboard Award, that Hope relieves a lot of pressure by always knowing when to come in, give a funny joke, to help him out. Honestly, Hope is the most sensitive (maybe Namjoon ties???) out of all of Bangtan, in terms of being able to act and react around situations. And it shows. Hope's language abilities is off the charts. He helps Joon cross very delicate questions very carefreely and carefully by inserting appropriate laugh tracks, creates the light mood. That kind of sensitivity? Perfect for language picking up. The phrase that Hope is saying is the least complicated out of all seven of them (in terms of meaning, it's basically just ""You can."") Which is typical of Hope. Simplest words. Fantastic sense.

Joon. Was. Kinda below my expectations? Because he rocks English so much? I suppose it's the weird pause he does in the middle. Yeah. It's not natural to you? It's not natural to us. I guess?? it could be because?? in Korean, such long word strings are quite rare? There are usually breathing spaces between every three or four or (really complex) seven characters. Whereas there's no such thing in Chinese. You only breathe when you get to a comma or a full stop. I mean, commas are usually spaced out every seven or so characters (in simple Chinese). So I guess that's hard for him?

But he's native perfect, better than JK, on 6/7 of the words. Except - ah, I really do think that J-hope and Jungkook are my favourite foreign language speakers. Namjoon's really advanced, but he has a very foreign feel. I don't know if you noticed, but he does this for English too. He feels textbook perfect, but he's got a sort of foreign slant to all of his words. That's how I feel about Chinese. (Maybe he does it in Korean too, and that's why so many Koreans have commented on mistaking him for a non-Korean. I ... personally never thought that Joon's spoken Korean was weird. I would definitely say that Suga and Hope talk more Korean tho.)(lol look at me, a non-Korean, try to give judgments about how Korean they sound)(But to be fair, many people have commented that Suga's rap is really Korean style, and I empathise with that.)(Basically, if I wanted to learn the feel of Korean language, the way you'd wanna learn British from a Brit, I'd choose Suga.)

Anyway, I never noticed before much, but I do think that Joon tends to be perfect except that slight little bit of foreign touch, which J-hope and Jungkook could be trained not to have. I'm quite sure. I'd stake potatoes on this. I think if you trained Bangtan super well in languages, I think J-hope and Jungkook would come out sounding the most natural native, and Joon would come out the most intellectual. I'm still divided about whether Jin would overcome his weird accent. He doesn't have the same feel that JK and Hobi have. Idk.

250,2017-6-9,2017,6,9,14,6g6gh2,"What ""Spring Day"" means to me (An interpretation of BTS' interpretation of Omelas)",syunie,1496985821,"So, today at school someone did a presentation about utopia and dystopia, and they mentioned ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"" by Ursula K. Le Guin. It got me thinking about BTS, especially as we discussed whether utopia was really possible, different rules for utopias and dystopias, etc. 

But first, a little background on ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"": It's a short story about a utopia where everyone's happy all the time, and when they come of age they're shown the source of the city's happiness. It's a child, who lives in solitude and bears the weight of sadness so that the city can remain happy. Once the citizens find this out, they may stay in Omelas or they may leave. 

We got to talking about how, if some of the citizens saw suffering through the child's experiences, then it wasn't a true utopia, because suffering shouldn't exist. However, a point I brought up was that couldn't a utopia just be a dystopia in disguise? If you restrict one from suffering and feeling sadness, don't you also restrict them from reaching self-consciousness and becoming more self-aware? Is that not also a form of censorship? We didn't really reach a clear answer here. Another thing that was mentioned was the fact that ""utopia"" comes from Greek meaning ""no place"", and ""dystopia"" is also Greek, meaning ""the bad place"". 

Anyways, how that fits into ""Spring Day"" is because they all leave Omelas, that much is clear. They all decided to leave the utopia and find what's outside. So, in terms of BTS' common themes of youth and loss of innocence, couldn't we extrapolate this idea to say that we all have our own Omelas? When you're a child, you think the world is amazing and full of happiness (at least, many of us are fortunate to see the world this way). You don't have to work, other people take care of you, etc. But when you get older, you realize that this ""utopia"" that you've been living in wasn't really real. You always wish you could go back, when times were simpler and you didn't have to stress or worry about anything. 

It's like Rapmon's beginning verse:

&gt;I miss you/ 
&gt;When I say that, I miss you more/ 
&gt;Im looking at your photo/ 
&gt;But I still miss you/ 
&gt;Time is so cruel 

But you can't go back, because you realize that someone had to suffer to give you that world: your parents. When you were younger you saw them as superheroes, invincible. When you get older, you realize that they're just people too - they feel sadness and pain, and though it was difficult, tried their best to give you a good start to the world. They hid their suffering from you, but you can see it clearly now that you're older. Now, once we leave Omelas, we understand that we leave that innocence behind, and discover the harsh realities of the world. We never really had a choice in leaving our utopia behind as we get older. Of course, I guess you could say there are some people that decide to never really leave Omelas, the adult-child. People who carry their spoiled nature and stubborn ways into adulthood, the people who continually rely on their parents despite being able to live an independent life. 

Of course, as the Snowpiercer is mentioned in the song, we should give a little background to that too. From the IMDB description: ""Set in a future where a failed climate-change experiment kills all life on the planet except for a lucky few who boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system emerges.""

So, we can say that the train functions as a sort of ""in-between"" place, for transitioning between the utopia and the dystopia. The world we've left behind was perfect, but it can't last, and the world we're entering into is full of pain and suffering. Perhaps we can even say this in-between place can be represented as the process of becoming a young adult, still seeing the world through new eyes yet not fully independent either. 

But why would anyone leave Omelas if they didn't have to? I think, it's because although we know we can never achieve the happiness we had in the utopia, it's because we know that:

&gt;[...] no darkness/ 
No season/ 
Can last forever

Even though the world outside is worse, we're still clinging onto the hope that we'll find happiness. And when we do, we'll cherish it, because we know that it won't last, but more importantly because it's real. It's isn't a hidden truth or manufactured happiness. More importantly, even though a true utopia may never exist, it doesn't stop us from continuously striving to make our own world a better place, because even if it's not perfect, then maybe it's better than last month or last year.

And lastly, I've got a few more open-ended thoughts on the MV. Especially the scene where [J-hope, Suga, and Rapmon are standing outside of Omelas](http://pm1.narvii.com/6369/a178eea1b345cdfa233483135389f828be397318_hq.jpg). Isn't it interesting how they are also the ones that bring sin to the maknaes in the BST Japan version? It almost seems like they are the mature adults who made the decision to leave Omelas, while the maknaes may have just gone along with it. What's also fascinating is how RM leaves the [train to enter Omelas](http://imgur.com/a/2U3QR). Maybe, the hyungs have already left a while ago, but have come back to bring the maknaes. And in this way, in the BST Japan version, they try to force the maknaes of the train of the in-between place of youth and bring them into adulthood? Idk man. 

Wow, this entire thing was a mess lol. I'm sorry if you read the entire thing. Here's some [bunny tax for u](http://pa1.narvii.com/6303/8e3eec0aaaf7b161794fb2a48854a8d301317ba7_hq.gif).

274,2017-6-10,2017,6,10,7,6gbsn3,Line-by-Line Breakdown of Jimin's Lie,nahetyfour,1497047807,"I'm writing this because recently I've been trying to be more creative, more daring, and it's mad scary? So I wanted to freestyle talk about Jimin's ""Lie"", because -



Well, Jimin's so truthful in this song. Joon did a vlive where he talked about all the songs in the WINGS album (I. I loved that vlive. I. I mean, I surface level love the maknae line vlives, but Joon vlives are the best. The ones that stay in my heart the most. I go back to Joon's words sometimes, to feel out how to interpret a song. Joon's like a surgeon doctor, in that he opens up the song like a flower under our eyes.) And Joon said that Jimin wrote this song himself, and Joon was so impressed by it that he didn't touch it. It's so utterly, maddeningly Jimin, from the sinuous curves of the music, the operatic styles, the whispering, sliding texture of the words. It's the kind of style that Jimin personally gravitates towards, and I LOVE SO MUCH 1) that he expresses himself in his song but even more that 2) that I feel it, I get it. Lie (and Stigma) are the only two songs I have from the solos. I loved Lie right from the start. It was addictive. (Stigma I got because I was trying to understand Tae. Still don't understand Tae.)



God, it's just, this song, I feel it so deeply because it's how to deal with criticism. It's not about lies per se, it's more, the difficulty in trying to express the truth of yourself, and being caught in that. Ugh okay let's just start writing about the song -



(using https://colorcodedlyrics.com/2016/10/bts-bangtansonyeondan-lie)



So, oh gods, the first part is just written as if you're a quivering mouse waiting for the smiling snake to slide over, curl around you, and eat you. Look at how straightforward Jimin is, compared to how sly and cunning the snake is.


.

  (Literally: To me, speak)

    (Your sweet smile, with, to me)

  (To me, speak)

    (As if whispering, in my ears, speak)

.


This. This should have been filmed as if Jimin was Eve. This kind of seductively evil, insidiously inescapable feel - It's so utterly spine-twistingly chilling that Jimin keeps whispering (Speak to me) (to me) (Speak to me). Look at how many times he repeats  (to me, naegae) and  (speak, malhae). Ugh, I just realised, they rhyme too, ""naegae // malhae"" such that it creates a repetitive, sing-song quality. Isn't it so Jimin? He's pleading, saying very simply, in four words, ""speak to me"", asking you to be honest, to talk to you, and he's talking to this sweet tongue devil that is smiling and murmuring in his ears.



I also love the use of the sibilant ssss sound in here? He uses it for smile (, meeso), whisper (, soksak) and smooth like a like a snake. (Those english words are a pretty good sss substitute, imagine those words in quick succession and you've got the song.) It's so consssonant with how he dances it. I ALSO love how he uses the soft sss with the hard kkk sound, so there's a direct parallel here with



.

(SoKSaK)   (GuitGa)  

(naeGe) 

don't be liKe a prey

Smooth liKe a liKE a SnaKe*

.


Okay, so I rather boorishly capitalised the SS and KK/GG sounds for you (In Korean, K/G sound is the same.) so that you have Visual Representation, but isn't that beautiful! Look at the beautiful succession of sses and k's. And it smacks so well with Jimin's style too - if I were a dancer, I'd use the sss sounds as flow movements, and the k sounds as jerk - stop - emphasis movements, and I'd BET that the music is structured that way too. I haven't listened to it in a while (I just soundtrack it inside my head) but I remember there being a series of staccato beats around the k's.



I'll do a quick caveat that I know that Jimin's written English here sucks. As in. I winced a little at the grammatical correctness of it, when I first heard it. But firstly, I never considered till now that it passed RapMon's standards. And secondly, okay, it's bad, but it's true to the bone. It's organic, and the rhyme fits, and even though it's 'Bad English', I get the meaning, and I get his entire feel because he's. Using. The Right Words. Even though they're the wrong words. I bet Jimin didn't dictionary these words. He felt them. They're the right mouth feel. (Some songs have really good mouth feel. The chorus of Closer by Chainsmokers ""So baby, pull me closer / in the back seat of your rover / that i know you can't afford / by that tattoo in your shoulder"". Many Taylor Swift songs. Not necessarily very sense-making in the context of the song. But AWESOME mouth feel.)



.

Smooth like a like snake

  (Escape, want to, yet)

.



Ugh, I love how he trails off on the (yet, shipeunde). It's such a lovely trail ending. It's not grammatically wrong, in Korean, but it's unnatural. It's sort of how I wouldn't end a sentence on a ""but"", or ""yet"", but. There are exceptions sometimes. It feels unnatural and so it fits with the song.



.

AH WOOOOOUUUUUUUUOOUU (anyone who doesn't ""ahhh woouooo"" along in their head is lying)

    (From me, leave, leave, leave, please)

   (From me, leave, leave, please)

.



Again, the  (to me, naege)! UGH Jimin you're killing me with your killer line sense. He's begging, he's pleading, ""for me, just this one thing, towards me, why are you so cruel, for me, why are you like this"". It's so personal, intimate. It's so creeping and twisty, I get it so deep. What I love is that he's taking a word  (to leave) which is normally used in the context of (don't leave) in songs, and instead he IS asking the person to leave. The  is usually imbued with a lot of sadness, hurt, resentment, ""why are you leaving me"", see: Big Bang's If You, the first line   That girl is leaving, but here, Jimin's twisting it around to say, LEAVE ME, PLEASE.



.

AH WOOOOOUUUUUUUUOOUU

    (Whatever it is, even so, me, me, save, please) 

  (me, save, please)

.



Ugh look at that spacing. So, Korean couples its language, much like how English couples its language through the usage of commas and fullstops. In Korean, you attach nounconnector verbconnector adjectiveconnector, and you space it accordingly. So Jimin mimics the previous couplets perfectly, if you can't see it, it's a 



.

    and

   

.



which is a 3 2 2 3 couplet. Korean language doesn't have this ""couplet"" concept btw, I'm just using English to describe it. Like, that's just how they organise their words. But I love that the organisation is symmetrical.



.

  (kae suk dwae domangchio bwado)

   (gojhi soghe pbachio issso) &lt;- I'm romanising them according to how Jimin sings, not how its written.

.


Okay, so we just had a bunch of really simple lines of repetition (leave, leave, me, me) and then SUDDENLY MULTIPLE COMPLICATED non-repetitive words?! (Complicated shout of happiness here.) So this line can be broken down into (I keep running but still / in the lies, I am falling in).



.

caught IN a LIEEEE~EEEEE

.


Okay, so again Jimin's non-familiarity with English shows through, because no one with a lick of English sense would say they were caught in a lie. That's a bad thing. What Jimin MEANS to say is that, he's TRAPPED in a lie. He means ""caught"" in the less common meaning of being bound by something, being grabbed and unable to get free, as opposed to the more light-hearted ""catch"" which the term is frequently used with. Honestly, Jimin's ""bad"" English tripped me up from liking the song a bit, at first. Your English mind just can't fall into the song as easily, because you're stuck on stuff like ""Smooth like a like a snake"" and you're wondering, ""What does he mean? Who is smooth? Is it the person's words? Or are you moving smoothly like a snake? Where did the snake come from?"". (Don't even get me started on ""Don't be like a prey."")



(A quick caveat, if anyone thinks I'm bashing Jimin's English, I'm not.)



Okay, I'll skip forward, because I want to, to the next verse.



.

  (I, to want // I want.)

   (the road, lost, the wandering // The wandering me who has lost the road)

  (I, to want // wants.)

   (every day, as if, like this, I // Everyday is like this for me, I...)

.



I mean. The yearning, the wanting, the madness of everyday life, I understand it.



.

I feel so far away

You always come my way

    (again, again, again, to do, I // I say again again again)

.



Jimin's got a thing for repetition. Maybe it's a dancer thing, where you need to have a basic move, and then you just variate on it. Or a music thing. (Oh, before I get into the fun parts, AGAIN, I need to explain Jimin's English. He's basically saying ""I feel so lost and far away from everything, you keep coming into and blocking my path, you always hinder or come into me way, and therefore ahhh WOOOUUOOAA get away from me"". Except, it sounds like a casual flirty ""You always come my way"" so like your mind gets really confused. It sounds like a love song or break up song kind of line! It's not. It's a get-away haters line.) Okay, fun part, I LOOOOVE how Jimin basically says ""again"", three times, in different ways. If I translated it in English, it would be    (ddo dashi banbok // yet again, one more time, to repeat). Isn't it beautiful. Look at that. I just.



.

ahhh WUUUUOAHHHHHHHHH

naegae soh ... etc etc

.



Skip skip.



.

     (ahhjhik naneun yeojeonhee ... etc etc // Still, the same as ever, exactly the same, it's me but)

      (From the before, exactly the same, it's me, here, being, but)

  (the rEALLY ending up to be growing big) &lt; okay there are two korean grammatical rules being used here that both emphasize that something is growing/ending up somewhere, and its growing in a negative way)

    (lie, is swallowing me)

.



I think I'll stop here, I'm tired. It's just, I guess, I dealt with a lot of hate in periods of my life when I was in my growth phases, and so that stunted my growth. I don't know how to deal with hate. I don't. Do I ignore it? Do I think about it? So Jimin's song really helped me through that. 



I had a lot of difficulty understanding it when I knew English and didn't know Korean, so I hope that this piecemeal freestyle translation gives you more insight into what the song is about. Color-coded lyrics is THE site I use for my translations, and even it didn't do a good enough job for me to catch the correct feel when I read it the first time. I was a bit confused.



But my heart heard Jimin. I listened to all the WINGS solo songs, went ""mehh"", and I went off to do my thing. And then, I kept hearing Jimin's song in my head. I heard it, and heard it, and I finally went to get it, and play it. I like it now. I can sing it. It was confusing, but my heart heard the soul of his singing, and connected it to the words in the way my head didn't.



Caught in a lieee~ I hope this gives everyone hope, who is trying to shine and discover and grow their self, to realise that when you receive lies and people and it feels like you're being swallowed up, that Jimin understands that feeling. And look at him. Look at how he shines.",35,60

being slightly philosophical here i'd like to reiterate that romanticism and romantic thinking isn't necessarily about love but it's more about the concept of romanticism from the 1800s i suppose - it's based on the idealistic thinking in contrast to classical thinking which is more logical. anyways back to taehyung i think one of the most obvious indicators of taehyung's love for fashion comes from the dominance of gucci in his wardrobe. as a fandom i think it's easy to conclude that we're obsessed with taehyung and gucci more than taehyung loves gucci. but something that is a bit bothersome to me about the obsession of taehyung x gucci in relation to this fandom is that we see it on a rather superficial level - of just ""oh taehyung is OBSESSED with gucci hes such as gucci boy he'll buy anything gucci"" rather than seeing it as taehyung appreciating art as he always has. fashion is art, gucci presents art, and alessandro michele (the creative director of gucci) is an artist. i remember taehyung set his kakao profile picture as a runway look from gucci's f/w 16 and has even expressed his admiration for alessandro michele which is evident in the new festa profile. 

whats interesting is that he could've wrote ""gucci"" in his brain map but instead he wrote alessandro michele along with other artists such as chet baker and van gogh. i admire taehyung a lot for that and i'm glad he's interested in fashion and gucci on a deeper level than we make it seem. i suppose i can say im a bit annoyed by how we perceive taehyung x gucci and im okay with being criticised with ""its not that deep"" but it really makes me think to how people see taehyung as dumb or an alien, and that his love for gucci is nothing more than an ""obsession"". it makes me feel that a lot of people still don't take him seriously and try to understand the thing he says. he has an obvious discerning taste for art and when people reduce it to what we see with taehyung x gucci it makes me feel a bit sad, i guess. i also think that begging gucci to acknowledge him has an opposite effect and its just never going to happen.

Well, I was thinking about talking about another song, but I'm overseas now, doing work, and I MISS HOME, and when someone messaged me ""Ma City"" lyrics, I couldn't help it, I wanted to sing it. Alright, Busan's sea, SAY LA LA LA LA LA~ (Look, I suggest you open up the color coded lyrics page in another tab, so it's easy to follow what I'm saying, because I'm gonna jump jump jump.)

.

   (you, wherever, live, the place you are going to) 

  

.

So first of all, can you see how the first two lines are parallels of each other? UGH. The only difference is the / which is You/I. It's easy to translate it as ""Wherever you live"", but a more accurate (and therefore complicated and unsingable) version would be ""You, at wherever (it is that you are) going to live / Me, at wherever (it is that I am) going to live""

ISN'T THAT UNGHAFFAFLE when you hear it, you hear the yearning, trailing off vibe that Kook puts in, as if the sentence isn't ended? Because it's not! The way I translated it in English, and the way it's put in Korean, it's a half-finished sentence, it's like trailing off a sentence ""Ah, wherever it is at the place I will live.....""

AND THEN JOON BURSTS IN WITH THE 

.

  (a long time, , to have run,  - banmal ending used here to mean like ""huh"" or ""hey, I've run a lot"")

   (I, to repeat, again)

  

Yeah ill be ridin and ill be dyin 

In ma city

.

**inappropriate groans** So, Joon always has the sexiest words out of all of them. Even though I love Suga's rap the most, I think it's the easiest beat to follow, Joon's rap is just, it's just. Okay, so first he says the equivalent of ""Yo, I've run a loooong time"". The  which means ""a long time"", he drags the  to sound like  or ""han chaaa^aaam"". The word  by itself also is used to denote a sigh, like when you're irritated at your sister dropping the ice cream when you told her to be careful ""ah, chaam~"" or when you're tired after lugging luggage up two flights of stairs. So ISN'T it sexy when Joon uses it like this, even though the word  has been combined with another character  to mean ""a long time"", Joon emphasizes the ""siGHHHH"" part of the word to make it seem as if he's been running for a looooooooong time? Just for additional fun, the word  by itself means ""one"" like  means one  bottle . So if you broke down the word literally, , it'd mean ""one sigh"". That's not how it's used, but ISN'T IT LOVELY that, at least to my mind, that Joon uses it to si~ghhhhhhhhhh his tiredness of running through the song? JOON-AH.

Then he tries to show how MUCH he's been running. He basically says ""I, again and again"" except he varies the words so that it's not boring, and THEN he repeats the previous verse TO SHOW THAT HE'S RUNNING AGAIN

Oh! I need to explain here! The word  which is the past tense of ""to run"", seems weird, like what do you mean he's running? Well, the word ""to run"" is often used for the feel of running through life, like, the journey feel, when you're tired, when you're fleeing something. It's not wrong if you use it to say ""I'm running a marathon!"" (Although slightlyyyy weird. But can.) But songs (esp. BTS songs) use this word to symbolise the kind of running that makes you tired, our running through life. You know our song ""DASHI RUN RUN RUN"" yup it's that run that is being talked about. Fun fact, the DASHI RUN RUN is the same word  that is used up there, and BTS uses the DASHI RUN phrase a lot. LIKE, A LOT. If I didn't love them, I'd criticise them. It's a bit how like ""Fire"" randomly pops up in a lot of BTS songs.

Okay so Joon's riding and dying (UGH JOON) in his city.

.

I dont know what to say 

    (I, die, also, to speak, cannot)

    (to me, $100,000, , to give, and)

  ? (different, place, ""go live there"" ?)

ah no thanks

.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. This is, you should see me when I sing this part, it's just, it's so badass, it's so Joon, ""ay-yo, I dunno what to say, it's just me man, I can't tell a lie, this is the truth"" ugh I LOVE IT I LOVE THIS LINE. 

Then of course, he compounds how sexy it is by saying, ""Well, I don't know what to say, even if I die I can't take up your offer"". It's so slightingly and passionately cool. So he says, literally, ""Even if I die, I can't say it."" The next line       ? is an entire sentence, and it's written in reported speech style, so it's literally, ""If you give me 100,000 (=$) and tell me to live in a different place?"" &gt; next line ""Ah, no thanks"" 

IT'S SO HOT It's, I'm really a hometown person, and I understand what it means to love your city and where you grew up in, and how even though I loooove being elsewhere and learning about other places, there's a deep and abiding love for home that dismisses every other concern, that loves your home city faithfully and irrationally and will defend it to the teeth and to my dying breath. I LOVE MA CITYYYYYY.

.

. 

  (I, die, even if)

  

Its the city of the flower, city of 

.

Ugh, then in case we don't know where he lives? After he says, ""Ah no thanks."" He goes ""Ilsan.""

THERE'S EVEN A FULL STOP BECAUSE ILSAN IS SO IMPORTANT LIKE okay Ilsan is nobody's nowhere okay i'M SORRY SEOUL PPL READING THIS but you gotta understand that Ilsan is like one of the provinces around Seoul which doesn't really have anything much going for it, it's the kind of city where like their TripAdvisor Number 1 place to visit is like ""The Expo Center in which the 2015 World Conference was held"" and stuff like that. But RapMon's like, ""Yeah, Ilsan. iLLLSAAANNNN BECAUSE MY HOME"". Like???? I'm so??? THAT'S RIGHT. Like, ma city has nothing much going for it too, but I LOVE IT, it's mine, and Namjoon just owns Ilsan so hard with that ""Ah no thanks. Ilsan.""

Then he repeats the earlier phrase he uses ""Even if I die"", but he combines it with ""it's the place I want to be buried"". 

Okay, the rest of Namjoon's rap is about Ilsan itself, which I kind of, I mean, I don't care about Ilsan. But I am gonna comment on this part, where he goes ""It's the city of the flower, city of "" because, of course,  is pronounced ""mon"" which could mean ""RapMon's city"" but could also mean ""city of MINE"" because ""Mon"" sounds like ""Mine""??? I just??? Namjoon??? Namjoon??? SO HOT???

.

!   

Say la la la la la 

  (blue, sky, above)

this sky line 

Say la la la la la

.

(singing along) JHA! BUSANOUI PADA YEOAHH!

I LOVE THIS PART SO MUCH Busan's sea SING WITH ME this is my favourite part I hate that this song only has it three times? I would sing it all the time? So of course, my favourite part is that IT'S SUNG IN THE BUSAN ACCENT FOR ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY BUSAN ACCENT you may not be able to hear it because 1) it's so short and 2) Jimin's so sexy that you can't even, but trust me it's totally there whenever Jimin is trying to play up his Busan accent WHICH KILL ME NOW JIMIN so okay, in normal Seoul accent it would sound like. ""Alright! Busan 'sss sea yeah, sing la la la la la"". But in Busan accent, it sounds like ""Alright!"" 

(Okay quick pause ! has the meaning of, ""Kay, get ready now!"" ""Alright, let's go!"" ""ooooKAY!"" (followed by ""MAKE SOME NOISE"") it's got that kind of ""allllRIGHT!!"" kind of feel. It's one word, so there's no change in accent noticeably, but THEN)

back to Busan accent: ""Alright! bbbb^UUU ss^AAAN o^UUIII ppp^A d^A ye^AH"" or ""Alright! bbb^UU ss^AA AN's se^AA ye^aaH"" Then normal, V's low voice running ""SAY LA LA LA LA LA"" And then of course the (blue sky above, this skyline) iS ALSO SAID IN THE BUSAN ACCENT so it goes ""bl^UE sk^AAEEY aa^BOVE, SAY LAA LA LA LA LA""

i mean, so hot. so hot.

Unfortunately these few lines convey the impression that all you need to do for Busan accent is to lilt all the word endings up. That is not true. I have a Seoul-born teacher, and when he imitates the Busan accent for me, all I can say is that the Busan accent is weird as HELL compared to native Seoul. When you listen to it on dramas too. It's weird. Idk, if you learnt Seoul ... LOL I MEAN if you learnt *Korean* from a Seoul speaker, the Busan accent honestly feels really like an accent. It's very, ""yy^AAA y^OU r m^oooth er is ^A h^OO rse"". Sorry I only know how to cuss people out in Busan accent. It's super natural. Fun fact, in dramas or movies, the accent (and usually the heavy Busan one) is used to quickly tell the audience who is the bad guy or who is the meat, the punchers, the heavy hitters.

That's why when Jungkook does it, for me, it's kind of funny and cute, also because Jungkook always makes a laughing, comic expression and does it for laughs? Whereas when our cute and pretty Jimin suddenly turns rough with his accent, ""heY are YOU joKING with ME"" ITS SO HOT ITS UNBELIEVABLE although I understand that for other people who speak Korean they have different reactions. 

Fun fact: (and since we're on Ma City anyway!) Daegu and Busan have the same sort of regional accent, although I hear that Daegu's accent is somewhat lighter. It's a little bit different, but not very. Jin and Namjoon speak the same, Seoul original. Hobi speaks Jeolla accent, but because he rarely does, I'm not very good with Jeolla style accent. There's also two more, Jeju accent (which is like, unbelievable, it's a whole different language, what the even) and Chungcheongnam accent, which I just don't hear so I don't know but I heard it's a very farmer accent. Oh! When I say accents, I don't just mean tonal changes. I think Jeolla has some tone change, and Busan has  A LOT of tone change, but there are also a lot of common words (to eat, to go) which vary depending on accent.

.

 babe babe

  city city

(Welcome to ma city)

.

So I skipped the main ""Come to my city"" because I don't have a strong reaction (much) to it. I do like the first line, which translates to ""Come to my city, I hope you'll look after me well"" but I LOVEE this line. So this line is again, so boss and badass, it belongs to Kook. It's so tonally pleasing, AND sassy. So it sounds like this ""kuuu reh, baby, baby"".  is a word used in many circumstances, to mean like ""Ahhh, is that so"" when you realise something, or ""That's exactly what I was saying??!"" when you're exclaiming to your friend that you TOLD them that the food at the restaurant wasn't good, but they insisted on eating there and now they're complaining about it. So here, it's used in a super badass way, to mean ""Yup."" As in, when I hear this line  baby, baby, I always think of Jungkook sitting on a motorcycle and coolly going ""Yeah. baby, baby"" in a sort of ""That's right baby, that's what I've been like, that's what I've always been like, , it's like this.""

so after this really hot line, another tonally pleasing bunch of couplets   city (city) ""eee gaeh na eeuoaeh city (city)"". I love so much that these words ""ku **rae** bae **baeh** bae **baeh** ee **gaeh** na **eeuoaeh** ci **taeh** (ci **taeh**)"" like it's so beautiful AND it makes sense. So he's saying, ""Yeah, baby, baby, this is, my, city."" ISN'T IT SO HOT. So, to put it in English, it would be ""He **ey** bae **baeh** bae **baeh**, this be **ay**, my **ay** ci **tay**""

Just try and tell me you're not expiring right now.

Okay, then RapMon does his run thing again.

.

   baby (I, Jeollanamdo = Jeolla South Region, Gwangju, baby)

    (My, footsteps, mountain, towards, go, yet)

    (Mudeng Mountain, summit, at, everyday everyday)

Ugh, I just like the whole of Jhope's rap. It's so bouncy and full of rhythm boing-ing here and there. So, I don't know much about the Jeolla accent, so I can't say whether it's here or not, or what's happening. I just, in general, I love the beat for this part. (But RapMon and the Busan sea parts remain my favourite.) (Which tends to be a problem.)(I sort of struggle through Jhope part.)(And then I yell out the BUSAN PADA YA part.)(And then I struggle through Suga's part.)(And then BUSAN PADA again.)(And then I gotta think about whether I want to repeat the song and struggle through the rap to hear two lines of Busan's sea intermittently.)(Life is a struggle.)

So what I like about Jhope's rap is that it rhymes every THREE lines. He rhymes ""Gwangu baby"" with ""meey il meey il"" = every day every day. So he's pure bursting through the second line through the power of rhythm alone, because the listener is trying to hear the rhyme, but not getting it.

.

  # # # 

## * # #  # 

 KI# A #  # # # 

bounce

.

Okay, so Jhope is amazing here yet again. He rhymes lines 1 and 3 again (ending on the emphasis word BOUNCE), but this time he slightly emphasises on all the  words. I hashtagged them # all, so if you can read Korean, you can follow his rap and see how all the (ee) sounds are beat sounds, even though some ""ee"" sounds come in the middle of the word, beginning of the word, or double up in the middle of the word (e.g. ""teehee""). Jhope's rap is hard to follow because his rap rhythm doesn't follow a nice 2-2-2-2 or 4-4-4-4 beat. Coincidentally (lol as if, intentionally), all these ""ee"" sounds ALSO rhyme with his previous verse, ""Gwangju baBY"" and ""maEIl maEIl"". That's why Jhope sort of misemphasises the Korean ""everyday everyday"", because he puts emphasis on ""everdAYe, everydAYe"" instead of ""EVeryday"" or ""evERYday"".

.

I'm skipping two lines, but for your information, he emphasises and lengthens the sound ""eeeouhh"" in those lines. It's just a nice touch.

.

  (all, saw, right?)

  (passion, to have put in, right?)

   (I, Gwangju, Ho-shi-gi)

    (all, whole country, eight provinces, gear)

~

(repeated for emphasis)

 #

 # 

  ##

   #

.

Ugh I love how badass this line is. So, to translate, ""All of you saw right? / I put in passion right? / I'm Gwangju's Ho shi gi / All you eight provinces in the whole country, gear up (i.e. and get ready)"". I'll point out how neatly he uses  ""ee"" sound to do the endings. (Although, **technically**, the first two endings are cheats, because they both mean ""... right?"" Similar to how ""guitar"" and ""wishing star"" are proper rhymes while ""singing"" and ""sleeping"" are cheat rhymes.) 

I'll also point out how he raps out ""Gwangju's HO SHI GI"". So, Jhope's name is Hoshik. But it's common to add an endearment ""ie"" at the end of people's names, such as ""Jungkook-ie"" or ""Taehyung-ie"", ""Jimin-ie"". So Jhope deliberately transforms his endearment name ""Ho-shik-ie"" to ""Ho-shi-kie"" (trust me, it makes a LOT of difference in Korean where you put that k) (I mean, not a lot) (I meant that it's a change I guess, it's a deliberate choice the way ""city of Mon"" is a deliberate choice). So he becomes ""Gwangju's Ho shi gi"" (the k and g sound in Korean are the same, life is strange, yes) such that he can emphasis beat on both SHI and GI because both are EE sounds. Instead of saying Hoshik-IE, where he would only get ONE strong ""ee"" sound (and one milder ""ee"" sound from the ""shik"").

I'm not going to analyse the last line, but I do love the ending sounds. Hobi drags the AAA sound ending in both. It's lovely.

.

BUSAN PAAADDAAAA YEOAAAAA

SAY LA LA LA LA LA

BLUE HANEUL AREH THIS SKYLINE

SAY LA LA LA LA LA

   

   

Ma City 

.

You can read color coded for the translation. I'll just note that I LOVE the Korean version of ""raise the roof"", which is   /   which means ""hands""  ""to shake"" . The other often used phrase when you're like, at a club, and trying to say ""make some noice"" is something like ""lemme hear you scream""  (literally: voice, raise) in hangul (""SORI JIILLOUH"") So it's usually combined in songs like ""SON HEUN DEULROH / SORI JILLOUH"") It's so mad I love it.

Then, basically, ""maaaah, city ro waaaa"" which means ""mahhh city, to, come"", which is....?

.

COME TO MY CITY

PLEASE TAKE CARE OF ME

KNOW HOW TO PARTY

WHERE I GREW UP MY CITY

HEYY BABE BABE

THIS BE-AYY, MYY-AYY CITAEH (CITAEH)

(welcome to my city)

.

I'm skipping Suga's rap because I prefer Suga's rap elsewhere.

.

HAN CHAMEUL DALLEO NEE

again and again I

in my city~


Say la la la la la la la la

Say la la la la la la la la

  (wherever, I will live)

  (wherever, I will be)

.

So without me pointing out, I think you can see the beauty of those two Korean lines. Only the  and  words change. Wherever I will live, wherever I will be.

a couple highlights: 

* her favorite member is Jungkook because she likes his voice. She mentions that his tone is very unique for Korean idols and she thinks he has a similar tone to Taeyang 

* she follows the infamous @jungkook_body on twitter and muses about how popular that account is 

* they talk a bit about his personality in part 2. I really loved this quote: ""when someone say they love him he doesn't respond like others. it feels like he would run to the Han River screaming.""

Overall, I feel like she really hit the nail on the head with Jungkook's appeal. I've always thought he had a tone suitable for r&amp;b and the Taeyang comparison is very apt. You can tell she has watched quite a few vids about Jungkook because the description of his personality is so on point. ",20,64

Personally the first time I heard 1 of their songs (Boy In Luv) was in an entry for my school's talent competition. I remember thinking 'OHO I love this rock sound' (outside of kpop I do enjoy some rock/alternative songs too). I liked BIL enough to download it onto my phone and watch the mv but ignored their other songs because of my limited interest in kpop then. Fast forward to an end-of-year camp, someone pulled up a few BTS vids on Youtube. We watched Danger as well as the WOH dance practice (the one in front of a building). It might be that I hadn't listened to a wide range of kpop songs but I thought WOH sounded unique, and that Jin's thighs looked *beautiful* in jeans. Hahaha so at this point I knew there was this group with a nice-legs member, but I didn't remember their name, and didn't realise I had actually heard one of their songs before -.- 

Anyway the next year they released I Need U, but I only found out about it later while scrolling OneHallyu. My search pattern was probably Seventeen&gt; somebody saying Woozi looks like BTS Suga with the pink hair&gt; someone recommending everyone to listen to INU because it's reallyyyy good. I just listened to the music without paying much attention to the mv and theories and really liked this song as well. At this point their existence finally registered in my brain, I was able to recognise BTS albums in CD shops and even considered buying their upcoming albums. 

When they followed up with Dope, I was more updated on the release schedule and took the initiative to look at their teasers and the music video soon after they were uploaded. RM's 'welcome, 1st time with BTS?' was cool, memorable and iconic; my jaw dropped at Kook's hotness and I didn't even know he was the maknae yet; Jimin looked  adorable with the red hair, specs and head-shaking dance; rapline SLAYED with their speedy rap verses; Tae's Conan cosplay made me chuckle at its relation to anime; Jin looked smart in his doctor coat. Most of all, I was super impressed with the choreography - how it had many interesting moves, and how they were able to pull off such a difficult dance perfectly and in sync. Coupled with the rather special song structure and sax instrumental, it really cemented BTS' status in my heart as a group worth stanning. I paid more attention to every comeback since then, researched more on the members, and also started branching out to their b-sides. My love for them has grown since then and now I am trash. So what about yall? :D

Specifically I was discussing Billboard success vs Chinese success and wanted to get opinions from here.

The talking points have been:

FOR: 
Familiar markets.
Simpler Transition.
More accessible.

AGAINST:
Limited market.
Smaller reach.
Substantially lower profits.

I'd like to discuss these things so if I'm replying, it's not to put down your point.

Which character do you think would be the main character being controlled by the player? Who do you think would be the boss or the main enemy?

I personally think that either Jungkook or Seokjin would be cool as main characters, and if the other members were in a video game they would be important NPCs. E.g. Taehyung would be the odd friend who seemingly knows very little about anything but actually turns out to be on the side of the evil people or something.

Their music is fantastic and relateable, they have great stage presenceand they are very kind and humble.

Which makes me sad that they are not able to break through the ""idol boy group"" stigma that Korea has but it seems understandable why it exists. the idol industry is so oversaturated with a lot of groups debuting every year and boy groups are most associated with fan girls and they don't believe that they have good music. But honestly if any popular artist put out the music they did the songs would have been major hits by now.

BTS is very well-known in Korea rn and they have been on the news..

What do you think BTS has to do to be able to break through? I want them to be well respected and have a lot of people that are not their fans that anticipate andtrust their music.

My opinion is that they should push their music more. They are known for being popular but notvery much for their songs. They should go on shows to talk about their album especially the Rap line who write and produce it. I think that could do a lot to elevate them from a trendy popular group to respected artists.

Style is a difficult thing to describe really. To begin with, I only use the word because 'genre' is too limiting. It has it's own issues but 'style' is really the best way I can explain it. (Flavour? Lol idk...)

With a new group of artists debuting under BigHit somewhat soon, I wanted to ask what you guys thoughts were on the direction for such a group.

There has been so much development of BTS and BigHit through each others influence over the last 4 years that I imagine plans are changing all the time.


So that brings us to a new group. With immense pressure and expectation on them. (Can I just add, man I don't envy them. Essentially they are in a position to have to do well for everyone. Themselves, BigHit, BTS, and all the millions of fans of BTS and the company.)

When you look at BTS' beginning, it was impactful and had meaning. It was hardcore Hiphop based on the core of the team.

So what do we expect from the next group. What will be their core? What do you hope it is? Are you expecting a lot (because I am)? What will be their own style?

Which is strange because I'm old enough to be their mother but I love them! They are so cute and fun and talented. But here's what I'm confused about - it seems like they live a bit of a strange life - ALWAYS on camera, living with each other in the company ""dorm""?, never seeming to have any privacy or date women. I've read that they claim to be too busy to date and that they have the freedom to, but choose not to. I've even read some stuff online about how many believe some of them are virgins. So many of their songs are about love and girls, yet it appears as if they have very little experience in this area. I watched American Hustle Life and was blown away by how awkward they all are around women - especially Jungkook (my fav!) I just assumed being 20-something men that they had their own houses/apartments, cars, go out privately, date, etc., but it seems like their lives are very ""controlled"" by their managers.

Note that almost every conspiracy is mine, and that doesn't mean it doesn't exist out there, it means that I thought of it and maybe somebody else already has. I'll note if it's not mine. Also, I had to do a lot of research for those, so please don't steal them claiming they're yours. I don't have a problem with people sharing the theories, but claiming it theirs is a no-no. Just remember that I love BTS and I don't mean to offend anybody that likes them too, they're just theories and obviously I don't think they're totally true.

  1. ""Weird"" Signs in War Of Hormone MV


I know that it's very annoying with all of these illuminati things going on right now, everyone's exaggerating, but some things in the War Of Hormone MV are too obvious to ignore. First of all, the one thing that I had noticed even before I watched the MV carefully was One of the illuminati hand signs, the one that looks like an 'okay'. You might call it a coincidence, especially because in the chorus the lyrics say 'okay' so that's what the hand sign probably means, but around the start when they're walking, singing/rapping the first verse,  not only do they do the hand sign, but they put it in front of their eye, which it one of the most obvious illuminati signs. In the first chorus, V even kisses it, which means he's showing respect towards 'you know who'. Moving on with another hand sign; in the first chorus, when the girl passes by, Suga, Rap Mon and V raise their pinky finger with their right hand, also an illuminati hand sign. You might be thinking 'yeah, but didn't they mean 1 by that'. Sure, but why the pinky finger? Maybe they didn't know what it means, but in the whole MV they raise their thumbs and index fingers, so why the pinky finger and why now? It makes sense, since Suga and Rap Mon are right handed, but V is ambidextrous, originally left handed. Not to mention only 3 of them did it, resembling the three corners of the triangle (goes kinda far, my sister thought of it). That's all, I'm sure I missed some, but whatever.

  2. Blood, Sweat and Tears theory


I'm sure you've heard about the theory for Blood Sweat and Tears. At the end of the MV, V lowers his shirt, showing some marks on his back. Many people think he resembles Lucifer, who has and angel that fell from heaven. Well, to be honest, it makes sense. In the beginning, we see Jin looking at a painting that a religious clusterfuck is happening (excuse my language). Then we see V, the supposed Lucifer, on a balcony, simply sitting there. That resembles the time Lucifer had in heaven as an angel. Later in the MV, Jimin is holding an apple and Suga a blindfold, then the door opens and V falls off the balcony. That surprised me there, since it was kind of deep, really. The apple resembles God (not for me, literally) and the blindfold- well, it's a blindfold. The blindfold resembles the lies and kindness they were blinded with so that they would stay in heaven, which in this case is the museum. Now probably the whole MV makes much more sense, taking into account that the museum it's happening in is heaven. The painting Jin stares at in the beginning is a window that shows what's really happening outside of heaven. Later, a hand is placed on Jimin's face to cover his eyes, and he pushes it away, wanting to see the real world. When V is sitting on the balcony, the doors behind him are closed, which means that even though he had another chance to stay in heaven, he was tempted by the real world and had made up his mind already. Most of them were chokers, which are like bonds holding them there, but some other don't, like V and Jungkook. Some people (?) try to cover Jin's eyes, the purest one in there, to prevent him from seeing the real world and being hurt. In another scene they're all sitting on a table and Jin stands up, looking towards a light behind him. That's the beginning of his temptation to explore the real world. Slowly, the people (?) trying to keep Jin in heaven decrease in numbers, so he starts seeing what it's really like out there. Finally, we see the members running out of the museum, so out of heaven, basically escaping. Jin is  hesitant, though, because of his easy life there, and the purity he was going to lose. Later, V covers his eyes and uncovers them afterwards, with a completely different scenery around them. That's V, so Lucifer, trying to get Jin to see things in another way. In front of him appears a statue of an angel with black wings, also known as a fallen angel. That resembles his true nature, and he accepts it by kissing it. Lastly, V reveals the wing marks on his back, slightly smiling afterwards. That shows he got rid of his old self and he is ready to start again the way he wants. Overall, I honestly thing the MV has less to do with religion and more to do with Jin maturing.

Sorry if that was too long, heh. Also, just noting that I'm not religious so all of the resemblances are from the internet. Also, I don't mean to offend anybody, it's just my opinion.

Enough with my babbling, what are your theories?

But, like Dr. Seuss once said, don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. And if knowing the status of the 4th Anniversary project helps make you feel a little bit better, then let us help :)

Alrighty, ready? Let's get started!

&amp;nbsp;

The theme of this project was to do an ""acrostic poem"". In short, we had a small [uniting message](http://i.imgur.com/EcoVNdT.jpg), which we then used to assign spaces to participants. We had **86 participants**, and we assigned each of them a letter character that comprised the acrostic message. Thank you to all our participants for submitting lovely fan art and touching message for our boys to see and read.

&amp;nbsp;

We have mentioned before that we want to be transparent with you guys, so we do have to let you guys the following. Because most of us coordinators are college students, finals delayed the book. It will be a few days late, but it will get to the boys! We are deeply sorry about this delay, but hope you guys understand.

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT**: please see [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWHygS9cW74) for a short video showing the final book!

----

Little side note here since we're talking about coordinators. We are always needing helpers! Especially around the holidays/finals. If you are willing and able to proofread, translate, or help us mail the book to Big Hit, please PM us to let us know you are interested. You will not be required to help out for every project, but according to your availability. 

----

If you'd like to see how your submission(s) was accomodated, PM us with your email or how you told us to credit you. Ok, let's continue!

&amp;nbsp;

With every project we have tried to pair a charity to donate to, usually to a cause that relates to the project. For this project, we chose the [Korean Association for Suicide Prevention](http://suicideprevention.or.kr/m/main/main.php) [^English ^info ^here](https://www.younghealthprogrammeyhp.com/programmes/korea.html). Mental health is a very important topic for the boys and for many of us that have been touched by their lyrics, so we thought what better way to extend a hand and reach out to help others the way BTS' music helped us. Despite being a relatively small international fan forum, **we managed to raise $182.88** WOOHOO!! Thank you guys to all of you who donated :)

&amp;nbsp;

Now, if you weren't able to participate in this project, don't feel bummed out. We are planning plenty more projects for the rest of the year, so please look forward to those.

&amp;nbsp;

Actually, speaking of future projects, we have a small announcement to make. But first, let us get this jingle out of our heads!

~ ~ *Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too*

*Come on, its lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,*

*Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling Yoo hoo,*

*Come on, its lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you* ~ ~

&amp;nbsp;

We know, we know, it's summer but we had to get in the holiday spirit to write the following. Have you guys guessed what we'll be discussing next?

Yup! The sub-wide Secret Santa project!

&amp;nbsp;

If you have been with us since the beginning of this year, you might already be aware of (and, hopefully anticipating) the Secret Santa we are trying to organize for the sub. If you are new to the subreddit ^(Welcome! first of all) or just need a quick recap, we are organizing a Secret Santa for the sub this year. It's something new, but we hope that with your help it goes off without a hitch and everyone that participates has a good time!

&amp;nbsp;

So, now, we need your help to assist us in getting a rough headcount of how many participants we will have, what countries everyone is from so we can estimate matching and shipping costs, and work out a few other details that will help us set up the project more efficiently. Please fill out the form, even if you don't plan to participate, because there are several different options to choose from and they can help us better tailor this event to cater to the most amount of people should this become an annual thing (which we hope it can!).

&amp;nbsp;

Remember, **this survey is just to get a rough headcount** to make our guesstimates a little bit more concrete. There will be more announcements coming as we get closer to opening registration, so if you are interested, please keep an eye out for those. In the meantime, please help us out by filling out [**this survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/vvbtAFN5reo1pgQE3) and have a very kkaep-jjang day! 

EDIT: we now have a [**survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/MVCCJuz0c2f5j3Rb2) for a standalone art exchange as well! Please answer it if you are interested; this survey is also to get a rough headcount only. 

&amp;nbsp;

For more information, u/Erinzilla83 is the main coordinator for this project, and you can either PM her or u/BTS_SecretSanta; u/BTS_SecretSanta will be the account for the Secret Santa project.

Some members have amazing potential vocally (especially Jimin, Jin, V and Jungkook ) that it could really even open more creative possibilities once they actually learn how to properly utilize their vocals, as well as being able to avoid the pitfalls of ruining their voices (so many idols already getting vocal nodules)

I feel Big Hit is now at the point where they can afford hiring a legit voice teacher (with formal training, unlike a lot of idol trainers) who can train the boys even while on tour  (he can fly with them)

BTS does more lives than many K-Pop acts I know (at this stage they're singing as much as Broadway actors while jetsetting all over different continents) and I feel it is so essential for them now to learn how to manage their voices properly.",85,162

513,2017-6-20,2017,6,20,4,6i8wi2,What are your thoughts on the struggles non-Korean speaking fans face when trying to sign up for Official ARMY membership and trying to sign up/level up at the fan cafe?,seoulfuric,1497902102,"I wanted to get some other thoughts on this because I used to be okay with the fact that BH requires we sign up with two Korean websites (Interpark and Daum) before you can apply for fan club membership. I mean, Interpark even has a global site in English, so it's not that bad, right? And, after all, this is a *Korean* music group, right? We English speakers should put in the hard work and learn the language instead of expecting BH to cater to us. I used to believe this, truly. But, after today, now I'm thinking it's not selfish to want a little more. 

Earlier today, I saw that another k-pop group I happen to follow on Twitter has a global site to sign up for their fan club and it includes instructions in English.  And it started me thinking...if this other group's company can do it, why does BH not consider doing the same? 

I have been studying Korean for the past year or so, but it is still a struggle to comprehend what I am reading and I still have to use Google translate *a lot*. Now, this has always seemed like a very understanding and friendly subreddit, so I will be honest with my feelings here, (and hope no one takes offense) but I have sometimes felt that non-Korean speakers are penalized (unintentionally, I'm sure) in that we have use the tutorial to sign up for the fan cafe, only to find out we can't access any of the members' posts unless we level up (which is fine, except the level up instructions and questions are in Korean and we aren't allowed to copy the text into Google translate or ask for and receive help in translating any of the questions.) I will add that I greatly appreciate the tutorials offered by ARMYs to help with the sign up process, but it is still a beast trying to figure out all the steps and then complete and submit the level up application with no errors. And let's not forget the difficulty of figuring out what error you made if your application is rejected (I'm sure many of you have been through this and know what I mean.)

I don't want to come off as sounding really pissed or too upset by this. I guess it's more of a small, sad, disappointment that it's so hard to be a part of the fandom (in an official, ""I have a membership"" capacity)--especially since I know BTS has a huge international following, with many of them English speakers like me.  I am so happy to be a BTS fan, even without a fan club membership and access to fan cafe posts, but I am wishing/hoping/praying for the day when BH may offer a global site for membership sign ups, or at least relax the rule for copying into Google translate if they are unable to provide a global sign up site. 

End of this feeling-sorry-for-myself-post. Thanks for reading.  

What do y'all think? What challenges, if any, have you faced with this issue? How did you overcome them? Or did you accept that there isn't a lot you can do about it and were you okay with that?",46,48

So, I was planning on making individual storylines for each member, and was hoping to use 8-bit/chip tune style music for each of their stories from their solos in the wings album (Jimin = Lie, Jungkook = Begin ect)




I was wondering if any of you had experience with making this style of music?

523,2017-6-20,2017,6,20,15,6icd1r,BTS in Music Bank World Tour in Singapore + Donation Needed For Fan Project,hellothisisclara,1497941157,"Hi r/bangtan!

As you may know, BTS will be part of the lineup for [Music Banks World Tour](http://asiaboxoffice.com/kbs-music-bank-world-tour-in-singapore) on 4 August 2017 in Singapore. As a Singapore-based ARMY I am SO HAPPY since we didn't get the WINGS tour.

Firstly, is anyone from this subreddit going? If yes, where are you guys sitting? Me and /u/muffsuga are in CAT4, Section T2. Not the best seats but the ticketing war was vicious :( 

**BTS x MUSICBANKSG PROJECT**

Secondly, to show our appreciation for the boys, /u/muffsuga and I are planning to run a BTS video ad in the largest screen in Suntec City Convention Center - where the Mubank event will take place. 

[This is what the massive screen looks like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pAeZ_OJoRQ) FYI the screen is the worlds largest HD screen according to Guinness World Records! 

**Project Details &amp; Cost**

We have been liasing with the media department of the building. The cost of running a 10 second video ad on this screen for 1 day on the event day will be **SGD 2,700 (after discount. UP was 3,000)**, which is roughly equivalent to USD 2,000.

The video ad will play from 7.00am to 11.00pm daily (16 hours). The video will show up 6 times in 1 hour, and 96 times in 16 hours. Because this will play in the main lobby of the convention center, there is a high chance BTS will see it. ARMYs coming to the event will also be able to take pics in front the of video when it appears.

**What We Need Help On**

We need to raise a total amount of **SGD 2,700 (USD 2,000)** to pay the media fee. I will cover the video editing cost myself.

We dont have a minimum donation amount, however, those who donate **$50 &amp; above** will be credited on the video itself. You can choose to use your username or your real name. The credits will run through the entire video at the bottom like a news ticker.  

We highly encourage Southeast Asian members of the subreddit to donate - since its a Singapore-based project. However, donations are open to everyone from other parts of the world too of course :)

We also welcome input on what the theme of the video should be about &amp; what messages and footages we should use. 

**In Summary**

We would like to gauge interest from r/bangtan members if theyre willing to donate to this project. 

We need to meet the required amount by 25 July latest as we have to make payment by 26 July. In the case where we do not meet the required amount, we will refund everyone back via PayPal and the project will not run.

If we receive enough interest from this sub, I will update the post with our PayPal account. If you have any other ideas how we can raise funds, please let us know too!

We hope to get your support to make the BTSxMusicBankSG large screen project happen :)

cheers,
 /u/hellothisisclara /u/muffsuga

Lovely mods, please help sticky this post for 1 week if you can :)

*****

**EDIT**: Thanks for the initial offer for donations guys! Due to strict PayPal restrictions in SG, I cannot create a new specific PayPal account just for this project. So you have to donate directly to my personal PayPal account instead. I will track the account daily, but do let me know if you have donated over $50 so I can put your name on the credits :)

I tried googling to see if anyone had posted a reason but couldn't find anything, so I thought I would bring it to you guys. Any theories?

I see this a lot on twitter and tumblr, and was surprised to see this attitude in some of the comments I've seen here. Sometimes it has to do with the music, but most times it has to do with their look, their dancing, their behavior on and off-stage. (And there's definitely a level of anti-blackness to it, as well.) 

I feel like distancing/negatively comparing BTS to artists who influence them, or even outright rejecting the source material they draw from (e.g.""I hate western hip-hop, it's all sexist and ghetto, BTS isn't like that"") is basically a condemnation of BTS themselves, in a way? If someone hates the music and culture that inspires the members or think that BTS is somehow above it all, how can they still claim to be a fan of them when they so clearly love it? 

Does anyone else have an opinion on this?

Like if you see him dancing in No More Dream, We are Bulletproof part 2 and N.O, he's pretty good. I'd say in those videos he's better than he is now. I was just watching this pre debut vid and I noticed Jin in the background. You can't see him much but when you do, he's pulling off the attitude of the dance really well and you'd never think he's one of the weaker dancers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Z0aWn9T0o

In the I need you, dope, run dance practises, I can definitely see the difference between the members and why Jin is considered a 'blackhole in dance'. Though watching Blood Sweat and tears, Not Today and Spring Day, it looks like he's gotten better again?

I don't know much about dance but I assume that Jin seems to be slightly better at fast paced dances with lots of sharp arm movements. What do you guys think? Have you noticed anything similar or am I spouting nonsense?

(BTW Don't get me wrong, I don't think he's a bad dancer AT ALL but, of course, if you're dancing next to 3J, you're bound to look not as good in comparison.)

ALSO, are you guys as genuinely impressed with his Spinebreaker choreo as I am? I honestly think it's really good! :D",47,27

599,2017-6-23,2017,6,23,7,6iwznv,The price to attend Jimin's old dance academy in Busan.,LindaBingsu,1498169970,"I used to live in Busan for four years from 2011-2015. During my first half, I spent five days a week ""working out"" at a local dance academy. In my area, I had two options, a newly opened dance academy in my neighborhood or a popular dance academy two subways away, which turns out to be the same academy (Nataraja) that Produce 101 Kang Daniel attended. I choose the former because the owner was super nice and academy was closer to my home; no regrets. Nataraja later moved it's academy to a more central place in Busan in the following year. 

Anyways, my dancing encouraged a friend to register for dance. And after I learned that Jimin attended Just Dance academy, I remembered this friend told me that she danced there. I believe she started going RIGHT AFTER Jimin left to Seoul.

For anyone who is curious, in comparison to dance lessons in America, it is cheaper but still more expensive than a Korean gym membership, to attend a dance academy in Korea. For example, at Just Dance (Jimin's old dance academy), my friend paid about 80,000 won (~$70 USD) to attend two classes each week, for about one hour. From my experience at MY dance academy, that hour entails 10-15 mins stretching, followed by 45-minute choreography routine/technique lessons to a selected song of the week. And then at the end of the week, the teacher will video record the dance with the students. These are the basic kpop or american pop classes, but there are several other focused classes available depending on your liking, such as popping or hip hop.

With $70 as the minimum and not knowing entirely to what extent Jimin's lessons at Just Dance academy were, I can roughly estimate that his parents may have spent any where between $70-$200 per month for him to attend the academy. I remember several of the students at my dance academy attended the same classes as I did, then stayed afterwards for focused technique lessons. 

Irrelevant to this topic but small detail about Jimin: since the majority of students usually attend a school within walking distance of their home, I can tell you that the area Jimin grew up is quite isolated, spacious, and rural looking. It's near farms. I remember because I often passed his area during my commute from work to attend my Korean language classes at the City Hall. But fortunately, there is a subway and many bus routes nearby that allow him to quickly get to his dance academy, which is near a popular university (Pusan National University) area where young folks like to hang out.

I always come on here to ask about Daum, I'm sorry ah ;-;

Anyways, I'm really confused and kind of scared.

I bought the BTS Official 4th Membership thing, however, I think I put in my DAUM nickname instead of my DAUM ID.

However, when I levelled up for the BTS Fancafe, they asked to put in my DAUM ID and I put in my nickname (I thought my nickname was my Daum ID back then) and I levelled up which means it was correct.

But today, when I logged into normal DAUM and checked my settings it said my ID was completely different.

I'm confused and scared that I won't level up with my Membership due to this.

At one of my junior high schools, my fellow English teachers like to choose a song in English for the kids to learn every month.  Most of them have been American pop songs but we've also done English covers of famous Japanese songs (ex. Hoshino Gen's SUN).  My students are really into BTS and my teachers have asked me if they have any songs in English. While they don't,  I figured maybe I could find a good English cover of one of their songs?

Given this, who do you think are the 'actors' of BTS and what kind of projects do you see them doing in the future.

I know everyone calls out Jin and I was honestly pretty impressed by the little acting he has shown us so far. I really think he would do well by starting out in roles like the lame ex boyfriend or the nice guy who never gets the girl or something. I just see him making a bigger impact in a supporting role.

I know Jungkook has expressed interest as well and I actually see him doing well simply because he picks up skills well. I totally imagine him doing well playing a high school delinquent or something lol

The one I am keen on seeing is Jimin. I know people say he doesn't have the actor face and such but I actually think he would slay in slice of life stuff like the Reply series. He has this fluidity in him that really fits dramas with that kind of vibe imho.

##[Jungkook's birthday project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project/) and [Rap Monster's birthday project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e7j/rms_17_birthday_project/) are now live! Please check out the linked pages to participate.

Hello again /r/bangtan! 

&amp;nbsp;

As you might be aware, Jungkook and Rap Monster will be celebrating their birthdays soon in September (Jungkook on 1 September and Rap Monster on 12 September). For the sake of convenience, we will be organizing these two projects in the same time period. We will officially open them around ~1 July, and close them sometime in the first week of August (all dates tbd). You guys will be able to submit content through this period, and in turn, this will allow us time to format everything and allow sufficient time for shipping.

&amp;nbsp;

For both projects, we will continue with the normal fan letters and fan art that has been done for each birthday so far. The only difference between projects will be the theme of each. 

For example for Jungkook's birthday, in addition to the normal letters, we thought about doing some (or all) of the following ideas:

* photography inspired (as his hobby is photography, we thought that ARMYs might send in photographs of meaningful places, items and so forth, or of anything in particular)

* an alphabetically themed list of recommendations in English (e.g. A for Aretha Franklin etc.). This would be dependent on interest and sign-ups (sign-ups would be in the first week of July, and submission time would be the same end date as everything else). 

Likewise, for Rap Monster's birthday, in addition to the normal letters, we thought about doing the following:

* as RM always shares great music with #RMusic, we thought about doing an #ARMYMusic to send music recommendations from ARMYs. We made [some mock templates](https://imgur.com/a/JmCdL) to help you guys visualize our idea. 

* potentially including a ""puzzle"" throughout the book for RM to follow. If time permits, the organizers would go through the lyrics of the #ARMYMusic songs and find timestamps on each submitted song to create an overall message. This might be as short as a word or as long as a few lines. (see this example [here](http://imgur.com/v26Kmyf) ). 

What do you guys think? 

Please note that the ideas above are not final and are subject to change. We'd welcome any comments or suggestions with regards to ideas for the projects :) Please reply to each respective comment down below with your comments and suggestions. 

&amp;nbsp;

Like with our past projects, we will be looking for a charity to pair with each project. Since we can't all travel and/or coordinate an international care package, we are strictly going to do a monetary donation. We'd welcome any suggestions as to which charity/charities you guys would like to contribute to for Jungkook's birthday and for Rap Monster's birthday each respectively. The charities can be international, and not just strictly Korean, just as long as they relate to interests the boys have. For the sake of convenience, we ask that PayPal be one of the available options for donating. Please note that donating is not mandatory for participating in the project; as with all the projects, the coordinators will cover all costs if necessary so as many people can participate as possible. 

Please reply to each respective comment down below to suggest ideas for each project. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also as a quick reminder, we're currently running a survey regarding the first Secret Santa for /r/bangtan. (see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6hwepu/4th_anniversary_project_closing_post/) for more information). This survey is just to get a rough headcount to make our guesstimates a little bit more concrete. Even if you think you can't or won't be able to participate, please fill it out to at least let us know you are interested! There will be more announcements coming as we get closer to opening registration, so if you are interested, please keep an eye out for those. In the meantime, please help us out by filling out [**this survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/vvbtAFN5reo1pgQE3). We also have a [**survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/MVCCJuz0c2f5j3Rb2) for a standalone art exchange as well! Please answer it if you are interested; this survey is also to get a rough headcount only. Both surveys close 1 July. If you have any questions about this project, please don't hesitate to contact u/BTS_SecretSanta.

&amp;nbsp;

**As a quick tl;dr:**

* JK and RM birthday projects will open soon (beginning of July) 
* both birthday projects will include fan letters / fan art (like other birthday projects) 
* We'd welcome comments and suggestions regarding our current plans for their birthdays (JK: photography inspired, alphabetically themed list of recommendations; RM: #RMusic inspired --&gt; #ARMYMusic; potential timestamp puzzle) 
* We'd welcome comments and suggestions regarding the charities you guys would like to contribute to for JK's birthday and RM's birthday respectively. 
* Please help us out by by filling out [**this survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/vvbtAFN5reo1pgQE3) regarding the [Secret Santa](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6hwepu/4th_anniversary_project_closing_post/). We also have a [**survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/MVCCJuz0c2f5j3Rb2) for a standalone art exchange as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Please keep an eye out for the opening posts of both projects!
 
As always, thank you for being so supportive and we look forward with working with you guys on the following birthday projects!

&amp;nbsp;
 
Sincerely,

The BTS Projects Team
