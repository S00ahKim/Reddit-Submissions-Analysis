I would be curious to know what you think of the differences you see between how we talk about BTS on /r/bangtan vs on /r/kpop, and also if you yourself behave any differently?

This could go about the type of things you would post to either subs (besides what's obviously not/allowed according to subreddit rules), the comments you would write and how you would react to opinions and criticism you agree or disagree with.

Are there differences because e.g. of the size of both subreddits, army already having a bad rep in the larger kpop community, armies being well represented in /r/kpop, you identify with either subreddit better,...?

What are your personal thoughts and experiences on this?

Would the fan theories associated with the particular song (and moreover the album it came from since there are theories like that) still work out? Would the MV/song look, sound and feel the same or different (and if it will look different, what would the 'new' MVs look like if it were to retain the message of the song/album)?

So the four most prominent BTS/Western singers switcheroos in my mind are (and note that I sometimes use different artists for different songs and keep some the same between songs):

*Blood, Sweat and Tears*:

* Jin - Melanie Martinez
* Jimin - Halsey
* Jungkook - Bebe Rexha
* V - Katy Perry
* Rap Monster - Nicki Minaj
* Suga - Cher Lloyd
* J-Hope - Avril Lavigne

*Not Today*:

* Jin - Melanie Martinez
* Jimin - Tove Lo
* Jungkook - Charli XCX
* V - Zara Larsson
* Rap Monster - Iggy Azalea
* Suga - Hayley Williams
* J-Hope - Avril Lavigne

*Run*:

* Jin - Melanie Martinez
* Jimin - Rihanna
* Jungkook - Bebe Rexha
* V - Rita Ora
* Rap Monster - Demi Lovato
* Suga - Cher Lloyd
* J-Hope - Ke$ha

*Spring Day*

* Jin - Melanie Martinez
* Jimin - Jade Thirlwall
* Jungkook - Camila Cabello
* V - Perrie Edwards
* Rap Monster - Jesy Nelson
* Suga - Leigh-Anne Pinnock
* J-Hope - Ke$ha

Again I apologise if this comes off as weird to you lot and if things go metaphorically south quickly then I'll delete this. I just want to get my ideas out there that's all :)",4,5

For me its:

- He got looks that books take pages to tell, he has a face to make you fall on your knees by Mikas Blame it on the girls lol.
Or

- ..living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it.. -Kanye Power

of course there a phrases which would fit them better but these were just at the top of my head.

I know it's near impossible to list all of their interviews since they have A LOT, but some is better than none and at least the more important/meaningful ones can be collected in one place.

---

Hello /r/bangtan! As you can infer from the title, we are ready to begin Rap Monster's birthday project :) And Jungkook's too! As some of you might already know, both the Jungkook and Rap Monster birthday projects will be run at the same time. You can read the guidelines to contribute to Jungkook's birthday project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project/).

Thank you for all your suggestions in our last post! We read them all, and we took them all into consideration; we're sorry we didn't post replies in the last post, we were busy doing the last bits of setting up for the projects moving ahead. We have tried to address most of the points in this post and in JK's post; we ~~will make~~ [have made a post for the Secret Santa survey shortly and extend the end date by a few days](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6lpk1u/extension_secret_santa_survey/). 

As always, we are looking for volunteers to help with our projects! If you would like to help, whether it be proofreading or receiving and sorting entries, please send us a PM. If you live in Korea and are able to help us forward the projects to BigHit, please PM us; we will reimburse you for any associated costs. Furthermore, if you would be willing to help translate the project (even for a short introductory message), any amount of help would be greatly appreciated!

Now onto the main purpose of this post! For our skim readers, we have bolded the main points and included a TL;DR at the bottom :)

&amp;nbsp;

As with all other projects, we will continue with the normal fan letters and fan art that has been done for each birthday so far. 

Since RM always shares great music with us through #RMusic, we thought about **doing an fan version of this: #ARMYMusic to send music recommendations from ARMYs**. We made [**some mock templates**](https://imgur.com/a/JmCdL) to help you guys visualize our idea; the template is subject to change slightly but will keep in this general format. 

We would like to include a ""puzzle"" throughout the book for RM to follow, if time permits. Granted we have the time, the organizers would go through the lyrics of the #ARMYMusic songs and find timestamps on each submitted song to create an overall message. This might be as short as a word or as long as a few lines; if all goes well, it should look something like [this](http://imgur.com/v26Kmyf). The ultimate format of this will be subject to our time limitation. 

Per your suggestions, we will include a link to a playlist (most likely Spotify or YouTube) with the selected songs. This playlist will be a complimentary component of the timestamp/lyric puzzle. Unfortunately, due to shipping costs, the risks of sending digital media (many celebrities will not open CDs/USBs etc. for fear of viruses and other infections) and potential issues with piracy, we will not be sending a physical version of the songs.

&amp;nbsp;

##\#ARMYmusic 

&gt; 
&gt; * Please send **music recommendations** through [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSretW7xW2ef4zg6tQHGkpQ2fIsu2KA8D_icPQwfV3RLSXHw/viewform?usp=sf_link) ONLY. 
&gt; 
&gt; * You may **write a message describing why you chose that song**, or some general thoughts on music. However, this is not compulsory. The word limit for this is up to 1250 characters (about 250 words).
&gt;
&gt; * You may choose to **write a message to be used in the tweet comment section directly above the music recommendation**. If you choose not to fill in this section but have filled out a longer message, a selection from your longer message will be used instead. Again, this is not compulsory. The word limit for this is of up to 129 characters (the last 11 characters will be a space and #ARMYmusic).
&gt;
&gt; * If you do not choose to write any description, #ARMYmusic will be used in the tweet comment section. 
&gt;
&gt; * You can give [these pages](https://imgur.com/a/JmCdL) a look to get a visual idea of what we're talking about. 
&gt;
&gt; * You can submit more than one song; however, please make a new submission for each individual song (i.e. fill in the form separately for each new song). 

&amp;nbsp;

##MESSAGES 
&gt;
&gt; * Please limit your message to **&lt;1250 characters** (about **250 words**).
&gt;
&gt; * No inappropriate messages. **Your message CANNOT contain anything inappropriate or any sexual content - we will remove your submission without warning if it violates this rule**. Examples of inappropriate content include, but are not limited to, the following - any references to: sex, BTS/nonBTS pairings/couples, self-harm, criticism directed to RM's parents/family/friends, 'stalkery' tendencies, including your personal information such as phone/email/address/etc.
&gt;
&gt; * Please include **ONE message per submission** using [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepaLWyIznl3R8zcU3-7KbnQmLnUEbMsbegjimxdxgQ6xnOEQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you would like to send more than one message, please use the submission form again for each new message.
&gt;
&gt; * Please also **proofread your messages** before submission to maximize our time compiling the entries. We may also edit entries for spelling and grammar (no other edits will be made). If you leave your contact details below, we will contact you regarding any changes made.
&gt;
&gt; * You can send a handwritten letter as long as it's legible and follows the rest of the photo submission guidelines below. Please **include [MSSG] RAP MONSTER submission** in your emails subject line when sending in handwritten letters.

&amp;nbsp;

##FAN ART / PHOTO SUBMISSIONS 

&gt;
&gt; * Please include **self created artworks and photographs only**. 
&gt;
&gt; * We are **accepting all types of media** (hand-drawn, digital media, photographs etc.). If hand drawn or a non-digital piece, please **scan or photograph your work clearly** to a resolution of **at least 300 dpi**. If digital, we ask that your piece be **at least 300 dpi** (if you are unsure of the size of your image, make sure one side is at least 1000 pixels). 
&gt;
&gt; * **JPG, PDF, or PNG** files are acceptable.
&gt;
&gt; * 7x7 in (17.78x17.78 cm) is the envisaged size of the pages, but you may submit any artwork or photograph up to the size of this space. The **print safe zone is about 15.5 x 14.5 cm (5.7 x 6.1 in)**. For handwritten messages in particular, we strongly suggest you write your message well within this print safe zone. 
&gt;
&gt; * email submissions to armysunite@hotmail.com with the **subject line** ***[PHOTO] RAP MONSTER submission*** or ***[FANART] RAP MONSTER submission*** or ***[MSSG] RAP MONSTER submission***. It is important that you include **RAP MONSTER** in the email title, or your email may be lost. 
&gt;
&gt; * Don't forget to **include your preferred form of credit** in the body of the message and to [**select your preferred icon**](https://imgur.com/a/FR749); as for RM's project we are doing a Twitter style of format (see [these pages](https://imgur.com/a/JmCdL) as a visual idea) this is slightly different from our other projects so far. 
&gt;
&gt; * If you would like to send multiple pieces of fanart / photos, you can send them in the same email. 
&gt;
&gt; * If you would like to include a message with your submission, please see below. 

&amp;nbsp;

##MIXED SUBMISSIONS 
&gt;
&gt; * If you would like to submit any kind of mixed submission (e.g. message and photograph, or message and fanart), please include each type of submission in the subject line **[MSSG][FANART] RAP MONSTER submission** for sending in a message+fanart, **[MSSG][PHOTO] RAP MONSTER submission** for sending a message+photo. It is important that you **include RAP MONSTER** in the email title, if nothing else, or your email may be lost. 
&gt;
&gt; * Don't forget to **include your preferred form of credit** in the body of the message and to [**select your preferred icon**](https://imgur.com/a/FR749); as for RM's project we are doing a Twitter style of format (see [these pages](https://imgur.com/a/JmCdL) as a visual idea) this is slightly different from our other projects so far.
&gt;
&gt; * Make sure the contents of your submission follows the guidelines above.
&gt;
&gt; * If you would like to send multiple pieces of fanart / photos, you can send them in the same email. If you are sending them with accompanying messages or captions, please make sure which messages accompany which images are clearly indicated in the body text. 
&gt;
&gt; * Please submit music recommendations ONLY through the linked Google form and NOT as part of a mixed submission. 


&amp;nbsp;

##DEADLINE + OTHER INFO 

The deadline for this project is **Aug 6 at 11:59 US CENTRAL time**. You can use this [time zone converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) to see what that translates to into your time zone. Remember to be timely with your submissions, since we will also be busy compiling the JK birthday project and we will most likely not have time to accommodate late submissions. If you need to set multiple reminders for yourself, you can do one of the following.

* Comment *RemindMe! 21 days* under this post, to be reminded roughly a week before the deadline. (You can also do this for any number of days before the deadline, e.g. RemindMe! 14 days or RemindMe! 24 days). 

* [View our localendar](https://www.localendar.com/public/r_bangtan) for deadline info; you can subscribe to events to be contacted about deadlines. 

* [Follow us](https://mobile.twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) on Twitter! And, make sure to enable notifications for us, so you can receive updates.

&amp;nbsp;

We will be sending out confirmation emails/PM's to double-check your submission is correct and/or to see if any changes need to be made. If you would like to be contacted about your submission, **please leave a contact** where we can reach you for these purposes, otherwise we will not contact you. **This information will be kept confidential and will not affect how you chose to be credited**. We will try to send a confirmation message within a week of submission but, depending on the volume of submissions, please understand it might take us longer. If it has been some time, and you have not heard from us by the first week of August, please reach out to us to double-check. We understand some of you are busy and that unexpected things happen, but we ask you guys to **please try to send your submission(s) at least a week before the deadline**. Usually, the bulk of submissions have been submitted within the last 3 days or so prior to the deadline; and, while it's not impossible to go through 40+ entries, it does set us back a bit with sending the book to print and ship. So please send your submissions with ample time before the deadline, that way we can revise and place your entry accordingly. If you know in advance or think you might be a **late submitter, let us know when we can expect your entry**; then, that way we can send you a reminder and we know to wait for your submission.

&amp;nbsp;

**The coordinators will cover all costs**, so as many of you guys can participate. We are a group of volunteering fans (not the subreddit's mods as some of you may have assumed), so if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping costs, [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and dont forget to **add username / Rap Monster Project in the comment box / cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name**. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations. Sorry for not addressing that in earlier projects.

&amp;nbsp;

##UPDATE

^We ^have ^updated ^details ^on ^where ^the ^charitable ^donation ^will ^go; ^please ^ignore ^all ^text ^that ^has ^been ^struck ^out ^as ^it ^is ^outdated. 

Paired with this project will be a charity donation in his name to **[WE Charity/Free the Children](https://www.we.org/)**, as we wanted to make a donation to a charity focusing on [furthering children and youth education](https://www.we.org/gb/about-we-charity/about-us/). In Africa, Asia and Latin America, they partner with communities to help empower them through a holistic, sustainable international development model to help break the cycle of poverty, especially so that all children and youths have access to education and don't have to work to ensure their family's survival. They also have educational programs in the UK, US and Canada to inform students and give them the tools to create transformative social change. 

The deadline for donations for both projects will close at **15 August at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL time**. 

&amp;nbsp;

~~As with all our projects, we will be making a charitable donation as our gift. Thank you guys for all your thoughtful suggestions in the previous post! We will be making the donation to an education/youth or nature based charity, based on Rap Monster's interests. We have looked at both Korean and international based charities, but a complication with many Korean charities is that donation requires a Korean bank account and/or phone number. So, we have narrowed it down to the following charities, please let us know your thoughts and suggestions. We will update this post with the final charity chosen and the actual deadline within a few days. For now, **the deadline for charity donations is tentatively 11:59 Aug 30 US Central time.**~~

~~* [WE Charity / Free the Children](https://www.we.org/) - the organization focuses on young people, with programs in Canada, the U.S. and U.K. for service learning and active citizenship, and international development projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America focused on children and education.~~

The deadline has been extended to 6 August 11:59 pm. Please also see the post for some important information about submissions, especially if you have sent or will be sending emails with large files as attachments. 

---

Hello /r/bangtan! As you can infer from the title, we are ready to begin Jungkook's birthday project :) And Rap Monsters too! As some of you might already know, both the Jungkook and Rap Monster birthday projects will be run at the same time. You can read the guidelines to contribute to Rap Monster's birthday project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e7j/rms_17_birthday_project/).

Thank you for all your suggestions in our last post! We read them all, and we took them all into consideration; we're sorry we didn't post replies in the last post, we were busy doing the last bits of setting up for the projects moving ahead. We have tried to address most of the points in this post and in RM's post; we ~~will make~~ [have made a post for the Secret Santa survey shortly and extend the end date by a few days](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6lpk1u/extension_secret_santa_survey/).

As always, we are looking for volunteers to help with our projects! If you would like to help, whether it be proofreading or receiving and sorting entries, please send us a PM. If you live in Korea and are able to help us forward the projects to BigHit, please PM us; we will reimburse you for any associated costs. Furthermore, if you would be willing to help translate the project (even for a short introductory message), any amount of help would be greatly appreciated!

Now onto the main purpose of this post! For our skim readers, we have bolded the main points and included a TL;DR at the bottom :)

&amp;nbsp;

As with all other projects, we will continue with the normal fan letters and fan art that has been done for each birthday so far.

We decided against the recommendations idea we discussed in the previous post for logistics reasons. **We will be going forward purely with the photography idea, as Jungkook's hobby is photography**. We wish to send him meaningful photographs from all over the world, as submitted by ARMYs. We want to theme this book by geographical location (so photographs that were taken in Europe would be roughly be placed in a section together, and those from America sectioned together etc. Please see [**this mock template**](https://imgur.com/a/TeAYq) for a visual description of our idea; if time permits, we'd like to indicate on a map the locations where the photographs and letters came from). You will be able to submit as many photographs as you like.

&amp;nbsp;

##DEADLINE + OTHER INFO 

The deadline for this project is **August 6 at 11:59 pm US CENTRAL time**. You can use this [time zone converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) to see what that translates to into your time zone. Remember to be timely with your submissions, since we will also be busy compiling the RM birthday project and we will most likely not have time to accommodate late submissions. If you need to set multiple reminders for yourself, you can do one (or all) of the following:

* Comment *RemindMe! 21 days* under this post, to be reminded roughly a week before deadline. (You can also do this for any number of days before the deadline, e.g. RemindMe! 14 days or RemindMe! 24 days). 

* [View our localendar](https://www.localendar.com/public/r_bangtan) for deadline info; you can subscribe to events to be contacted about deadlines. 

* [Follow us](https://mobile.twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) on Twitter! And, make sure to enable notifications for us, so you can receive updates.

&amp;nbsp;

We will be sending out confirmation emails/PM's to double-check your submission is correct and/or to see if any changes need to be made. If you would like to be contacted about your submission, **please leave a contact** where we can reach you for these purposes, otherwise we will not contact you. This information will be kept confidential and will not affect how you chose to be credited. We will try to send a **confirmation message within a week of submission** but, depending on the volume of submissions, please understand it might take us longer. **If it has been some time, and you have not heard from us by the first week of August, please reach out to us to double-check**. We understand some of you are busy and that unexpected things happen, but we ask you guys to **please try to send your submission(s) at least a week before the deadline**. Usually, the bulk of submissions have been submitted within the last 3 days or so prior to the deadline; and, while it's not impossible to go through 40+ entries, it does set us back a bit with sending the book to print and ship. So please send your submissions with ample time before the deadline, that way we can revise and place your entry accordingly. If you know in advance or think you might be a **late submitter, let us know when we can expect your entry**; then, that way we can send you a reminder and we know to wait for your submission.

&amp;nbsp;

**The coordinators will cover all costs**, so as many of you guys can participate. We are a group of volunteering fans (not the subreddit's mods as some of you may have assumed), so if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping costs, [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please, [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and dont forget to **add username / Jungkook Project / cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name in the comment box**. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations. Sorry for not addressing that in earlier projects.

&amp;nbsp;

##UPDATE: 

^We ^have ^updated ^details ^on ^where ^the ^charitable ^donation ^will ^go; ^please ^ignore ^all ^text ^that ^has ^been ^struck ^out ^as ^it ^is ^outdated. 

Paired with this project is a **charity donation to BAPS** (Busan Abandoned Pet Sanctuary) that will be our gift to JK, as he has [mentioned](http://www.vlive.tv/video/17071) wanting to help abandoned dogs in the past. [BAPS](http://shindogs.org/) is known for being *a no-kill based animal sanctuary in Busan that focuses on re-homing abandoned dogs*. They do a lot of good work in helping abandoned dogs at a shoestring budget, including vaccinating all their dogs, providing medical care and a safe space for their dogs until they are adopted. Since we can't all go to Korea, and we're all spread out across the world to coordinate effectively, we will be making a donation on his name from us here at the sub. 

The deadline for donations for both projects will close at **15 August at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL time**. 

&amp;nbsp;

~~As with all our projects, we will be making a charitable donation as our gift. Thank you guys for all your thoughtful suggestions in the previous post! We have looked at both Korean and international based charities, but a complication with many Korean charities is that donation requires a Korean bank account and/or phone number. We will be making the donation to either the Special Olympics, based on his love for fitness, or BAPS, an animal shelter in Busan, as he has mentioned before that his dog was from a shelter and he is interested in this kind of work (see below for more details).~~

~~Please let us know your thoughts and suggestions. We will update this post with the final charity chosen and the actual deadline within a few days. For now, **the deadline for charity donations is tentatively 11:59 pm Aug 30 US Central time**.~~ 


~~* [Special Olympics](http://www.specialolympics.org/) - Special Olympics is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, providing year-round training and competitions to more than 5.3 million athletes and Unified Sports partners in nearly 170 countries.~~

~~* [Busan Abandoned Pet Sanctuary \(BAPS\)](http://shindogs.org/) - a no-kill based animal sanctuary in Busan whose focus is on rehoming abandoned dogs.~~ 

&amp;nbsp;

That was long! Thanks for reading till the end, so let's do a quick recap :)

* For **photo/fanart submissions or handwritten messages**, please email submissions to armysunite@hotmail.com with the **subject line** **[PHOTO] JUNGKOOK submission** for photos, **[FANART] JUNGKOOK submission** for  fanart, and **[MSSG] JUNGKOOK submission** for handwritten letters.

165,2017-7-7,2017,7,7,7,6lpk1u,Extension - Secret Santa survey,BTSprojects,1499381970,"Hi again, /r/bangtan! Based on feedback from our last [thoughts post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6k7ed4/thoughts_on_jungkook_and_rap_monsters_birthdays/), we're making a separate post for the Secret Santa survey. All the important information is summarized in a tl;dr at the end for your convenience. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
If you have been with us since the beginning of this year, you might already be aware of (and, hopefully anticipating) the Secret Santa we are trying to organize for the sub. If you are new to the subreddit ^(Welcome! first of all) or just need a quick recap, we are organizing a Secret Santa for the sub this year. It's something new, but we hope that with your help it goes off without a hitch and everyone that participates has a good time!

So, now, we need your help to assist us in getting a rough headcount of how many participants we will have, what countries everyone is from so we can estimate matching and shipping costs, and work out a few other details that will help us set up the project more efficiently. Please fill out the [**survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/vvbtAFN5reo1pgQE3) for the **Secret Santa**, even if you don't plan to participate, because there are several different options to choose from and they can help us better tailor this event to cater to the most amount of people should this become an annual thing (which we hope it can!). We also have a [**survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/MVCCJuz0c2f5j3Rb2) for a **standalone art exchange** as well. Please answer it if you are interested; this survey is also to get a rough headcount only.

Remember, **both surveys are just to get a rough headcount** to make our guesstimates a little bit more concrete. Filling out this survey will not register you for the actual Secret Santa itself. There will be more announcements coming as we get closer to opening registration, so if you are interested, please keep an eye out for those. 

The survey will close in a few days time around July 9. If you have any questions about this project, please don't hesitate to contact u/BTS_SecretSanta.

&amp;nbsp;

Please also remember that [**Jungkook's birthday project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project/) and [**Rap Monster's birthday project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e7j/rms_17_birthday_project/) are now live! Please check out the linked pages to participate. 

&amp;nbsp;

##TL;DR

* Please help us out by filling out [**this survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/vvbtAFN5reo1pgQE3) regarding the upcoming **Secret Santa**. 

* We also have a [**survey**](https://goo.gl/forms/MVCCJuz0c2f5j3Rb2) for a **standalone art exchange** as well. Please answer it if you are interested. 

* Both surveys are for **rough headcounts** only and do not act as an actual registration. They will close around July 9. 

* If you have any questions about the Secret Santa project, please don't hesitate to contact u/BTS_SecretSanta.

* Please check out [**Jungkook's birthday project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project/) and [**Rap Monster's birthday project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e7j/rms_17_birthday_project/). 

&amp;nbsp; 

As always, thank you for being so supportive and we look forward with working with you guys on the following projects!

&amp;nbsp;
 
Sincerely,

The BTS Projects Team

The replies were all so cute and I though it would be fun to do a BTS-exclusive version. Unbiased folks can share whatever moments they'd like!

For me:

KNJ - I had ever, ever so slowly been falling for Joon and then he decided to to be funny and tweet [this](https://twitter.com/bts_twt/status/870459318717394944?lang=en) on June 1st and that was the last straw. Affirmed when I literally dissolved into a puddle of oh-god-oh-god-oh-god during his most recent vlive despite not speaking a lick of Korean.

KSJ - First time I saw him, pretty much. I fell in love with his eyebrows. But then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rwe_Fbbg9k), *this* made me just so unbearably Fond.

JHS - [This fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-CblVwW1FQ) set the stage and then [this](https://bangtanfeathers.tumblr.com/post/160676958687/sugamysavagebaby-everyone-heres-7-secs-of) and [this](https://bangtanfeathers.tumblr.com/post/161694309047/gotjhope-breathless) destroyed me once and for all.

For myself I was introduced to BTS via Dope reaction mv. My first impression was on how young they looked, esp maknae lines so I had been reluctant to check out the group, but I couldn't stop watching it thanks to Jin &amp; Jimin.
One video, led to another, until I realized too late that I've fallen into the Bangtan hole. 
BTS is honestly the longest group I've ever stanned, and also arguable the first group where I'm a noona. It's both odd and exciting honestly, esp when I show them to my students in class BTS mvs, managed to convert a few of them. My mom is getting there, she knows about my fangirling, and although she think they look like babies and too pretty for her taste, she is somewhat intrigued about Suga, and when BBMA played on my cable TV my mom was also getting excited along with me.

231,2017-7-10,2017,7,10,6,6ma4rd,BTS: About Korean relevancy &amp; CFs,daleesai,1499636067,"One of the thing that boggles me is how BTS is consistently getting the top rank is branding relevancy but they aren't getting any CFs/endorsements/spokesperson opportunities despite this. A lot of the groups ranking much lower than them are getting more CFs than them. Groups of their 'tier' like EXO and Twice have heaps. And the upcoming boy group Wanna One is going to have at least 7 pre-debut (I know it's a popular show and stuff, but I'm just talking about perspective here). I wonder if this had something to do with their reputation? None of the group members are really identifiable as individuals (at least when I was in Korea, the band  was known but no one can really name a specific member, and when they do it tends to be Rapmon) and they aren't the usual visual ""it boy"" material the Korean GP tends to look at such as ASTRO's Cha Eunwoo. The Big 3 companies have the strings to pull to get their acts those CFs too.I wonder if it had something to do with Bighit's leverage in the industry as well, they don't have as much power/connections to score relevant CF gigs. 

What I realized when I'm with my Korean friends is that they know BTS is popular overseas, but they don't understand they're the *most* popular K-Pop band overseas. They think they're just one of those Hallyu idol groups liked by overseas fans no different from Super Junior, many of them are unable to make the distinction that BTS is one of those Hallyu groups attracting an audience *outside* the international K-Pop community. It's pretty much the only K-Pop band I know that gets a wider age demographic fan-wise amongst international fans (in contrast to how a lot of Korean ARMYs are, also K-pop boybands either appeal to teens or noona fans, but international ARMYs are just too diverse &amp; I've been in K-Pop since 2003) and that BTS is pretty much the gateway of many non-Koreans into K-pop these days, not a Big 3 group unlike in the past. 

The thing is BTS *are* now marketable and how fast their international tours sold out is just a proof of that. Given I haven't been back in Korea for over a year now, I've been told a lot of things changed since Wings came out and their profile in their homeland shot up but it boggles me why it never translates to CFs.",63,82

It seems like they only are doing touring and a bit of Tv variety. It would be awesome to see them on Knowing Brothers, but that will probably never happen. I know rap line does music compositions for BTS obviously, but I wonder when other members not really do anything has to do more with BigHit or the members. For example, I know apparently Jin is an actor or studies it, but I don't know if he'll ever be cast in a drama or anything anytime soon. If they do Hit the Stage again this year, that would be an awesome opportunity for Hobi or Jimin, but I doubt they would be on the show ever.

Why do you think they're *Beyond* The Scene?

For me, it means BTS is ready to go beyond their comfort zone and the expectations of people around them &amp; themselves. I feel it's gonna be an era of broadening horizons, breaking barriers and trying to reach a whole new level of achievements that maybe no one before them has even dared to dry. This is what the door means for me, they're gonna go beyond the scene and open doors. They'll go beyond being idols, beyond being just K-Pop and all that jazz.

Would be interesting to hear your interpretation for it.",15,21

I have seen immense growth in the youtube views for songs like Boy in Luv, Dope (everyone was aiming for it to hit 200m by year end but at the rate it's going, it's going to hit the goal far earlier), Fire (especially after BBMAs, the views just zoomed up), Blood Sweat and Tears and Not Today. 

Even Save Me easily crossed the 100m view mark and it wasn't a hype song. Meanwhile, MVs of I Need U or Run whose MVs are more drama than dance don't get the same surge of views even if the music is good and those were the songs which helped them rise in Korea.

[](#jh_sun)  

I would have posted this earlier, but alas I have been busy in real life and haven't been able to be online as much lately. But today's my day off, so here we go!  

******

Now that the 2017 WINGS Tour has concluded after the final stop in Sapporo, I wanted to remind everyone that [you can go back through all of the threads we've had on here over the past few months to relive the hype via the WINGS Tour megathread archive page on the sub's wiki!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/wingstour)  

That was the main thing I wanted to announce, but here are some other neat things that are also on the wiki:  

* /u/yeon_kimin made the amazing [Festa archive page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/festa) on the wiki, so if you missed some of the past or present festa activities, you can make sure you've seen it all there!  
* Now that we have a new sub theme, I wanted to remind everyone that we have a [sub layout archive page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/layouts) on the wiki for nostalgia purposes ;)  
* I will forever shill the [audio](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/audio) and [cover masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/covers) pages because I think they're the best thing since sliced bread, and both old and new fans will probably find a song or cover they've never heard before there. Particularly new fans!  

Reminder that anyone with over 250 karma on the subreddit can add/edit a wiki page, and you can access the wiki at any time by typing: www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki into your browser. (or you can hover over ""main &gt; wiki"" in the top menu bar of the sub on desktop).

Well, we finally have some evidence that explains the lyrics of those songs from BTS themselves. It goes into more details than Namjoon and Big Hit's ""apology"" when War of Hormone became controversial:

* Looking back, **from the start of school trilogy in 2013 to &lt;WINGS&gt;, BTS history was the story of why, by what and how the boy lives, and also a great journey to come to that conclusion.** In 'school trilogy, BTS were **teenagers who arent tamed by the rules of the world.** They shouted Hey, whats your dream? to peers who dont have much worry about the future, to the school that forces the same old way of thinking, the same old goals, and to all the adults. Their debut album &lt;2 Cool 4 Skool&gt; and &lt;O!RUL8,2?&gt; (Oh! Are You Late, Too?) were the voice of boys who are young but determined to decide their own life path. **That teenage energy passed through &lt;Skool Luv Affair&gt; and &lt;DARK&amp;WILD&gt;, adding the face of the vigorous, red-blooded youth who fight for love recklessly.** Dream, happiness, love. **They were what teenagers wanted to hear about more than anything, what no one had talked about for a long time, but BTS bared them all out truthfully through 'school trilogy.** 
Source: BTS Concept Book

Songs like Danger and Boy in Luv and War of Hormone were actually intended to be that off-putting or controversial, seeing how it's all about teens/youths who haven't yet fully been socialized? and are more likely to just go after what they want recklessly and say what they want recklessly without thinking about how it comes across. 
 
I did see this theory floating around as an explanation for the lyrics of those songs but they were drowned out under the bashing so it's a relief to have actual proof/explanation from the horse's own mouth as an undisputed explanation for the thought processes behind those songs. ARMYs can now feel more confident when they defend those allegations because we have solid proof now.
 
Just something that caught my eyes as I was reading

And was so surprised by the huge improvement in English in **all** members , which for some reason wasn't as showcased in the recent US interviews (though it strengthens the theory they certainly understand what is going on)

But I have been a huge Jpop/Jdrama fan for a long time and picked up the language in university. I know the boys have been doing Japanese promos for some years now but for some reason...their English sounds better despite them using it a bit more recently?  I know they had to take Japanese lessons since they were trainees. Taehyung probably sounds best/speaks best Japanese in the group but his English is quite good as well (maybe he's that member who picks up languages well). Even Taehyung who is the best in Japanese struggles to express himself in that language (plus his accent in Japanese is thicker than in English) but he seems borderline conversational in English recently. Suga, Hobi, Jungkook have been showing abilities in saying complex sentences/colloquial expressions too. I would peg Jin as surely conversational by this point and even Jimin is starting to speak up.

Are they getting official, formal English tutoring right now or are they simply picking it up due to touring? Because they've been going to the US in the past but their English now has improved tenfolds (even more than AHL imo)",34,25
334,2017-7-14,2017,7,14,10,6n5wsw,On Rapmon &amp; Suga being idols,savingmyjams,1499994313,"Was rewatching the whole [BFree dissing Rapmon &amp; Suga spectacle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A60nxqU_uIE) again and it was very interesting to note that Rapmon &amp; Suga were very honest in their reaction and I get the impression they dislike being idols here (Rapmon's statement about hating the smokey makeup, Suga looking insulted when it was implied they depend on fangirls etc)

We all know they used to be part of the underground hiphop scene and they initially didn't aspire to be idols (Rapmon was part of Daenamhyup and Suga was a member of D-Town + preparing to be a producer). Both of them entered Big Hit with the belief they will be doing actual hiphop. taking a more SMTM-like path rather than Produce 101. For some reason plans fell through and a lot of the other trainees who belonged to the same crew as Rapmon left Bighit once it became clearer that BTS was poised to go to the idol path.

It makes me wonder. If they disliked being idols so much, how come they stayed on? It's evident that as of 2013, they still haven't embraced the concept of being idols and the fact that they have to dance &amp; wear makeup. As I wasn't a fan in the early BTS days, can fans point out at what point in BTS history do you think they have seemed to finally accepted and came to terms that they were idols (and realized they made the right decision for staying on)",41,79

For example, I have been a fan since 2014. At that point BTS was kind of known in the Kpop community but they weren't that big. Mostly brushed off as nugu. Fans from my era got to witness their first win and a huge influx of fans in 2015 because of INU and Dope. Fans that joined after that and we got to see BTS first world tour and had to go through BTS first sajaegi accusations. Fans that joined us around Fire era got to see the worst part of Kpop culture when people started accusing them of plagiarism and they became the victim of cyber attacks but we survived.

Now we have the Wings/ post wings era. They know BTS to be daesang winners and a big international Hallyu star with millions of fans all over the world. Fans post YNWA see BTS as the BBMA winners and the group gaining international attention outside of the Kpop scope. 

Long essay lol but my question is what is your era and your experience Stanning BTS? If you are a pre wings Stan did you see them making it this far? If you are a post Wings stan, what is your perspective on BTS' popularity? Were you aware of the set backs they have had in the past? 

For me, I am really astonished. It still took me by surprise. I remember thinking ""will they ever win a music show?"" And now look where they are.

She says the only way BTS can leave a distinct mark is if they achieve something no predecessor in K-Pop has achieved and it's much harder for them coming from a non-big three company to do this unless they set their eyes on getting the western validation not even Psy could achieve (but like Bang PD said 'no plans of US expansion')

I usually shrug off negative opinions  like this but she's a BTS fan and long time K-Pop connoisseur that it made me ponder if we are already seeing the peak growth of international ARMY or do you reckon there's a chance for another new wave of fans to join in?",51,26

Not just one or two articles but the demographic for almost all of their articles would be dominated by people in their 20's, 30's, and 40's. This is very different from 2016. It was hard to find any article that didn't have the 10's making up almost half of the age demo. I compiled samples for comparison. 


[
**2016**](http://imgur.com/a/bXmSz)




[**2017**](http://imgur.com/a/vnAO7)


I thought the change might have happened after the wings comeback or the daesang articles but surprisingly the demographics were similar to pre-wings CB. So basically people in their 10's dominated followed by people in their 20's.

I noticed that the change happened after SD, most of the samples I compiled for 2017 is from Feb-July. And for 2016 it's from Mar-Dec.

I also noticed a lot of comments that peachi translates where some of the older fans would mention that they're fans of older k-pop groups, some of them don't specify the groups, but some of them would mention that they're ex-cassies(TVXQ fans) but are fans of bts now. Some of them would say that they *never* thought they'd be a fan of an idol group. I don't know if there's a reason for that but I just thought it was interesting.

So for the sake of discussion what do you think is the possible reason or reasons for this change?

(wasn't able to see them debut because they got buried bad with all the debuts happening in 2012-2013) but kinda felt off with the whole tryhard gangsta hiphop they were trying to pull off. I am very sensitive to group dynamics and I kinda didn't like theirs during that era. Liked HYYH era musically but something still felt amiss in their group dynamics for me but all that changed during Fire/Save Me. They just had a unique energy at that point and by the end of BV 1 (friend made me watch) I knew I became trash. It was telling since now we know they definitely had a shift in 2016 and it showed in everything they did. I saw BTS grow but didn't stan till 2016.

what is your turning point?

#The fanart contest has now concluded!

We got a bunch of lovely entries which you can all go admire [in the contest thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6m3rb9/rbangtan_10k_special_event/) once more. We can reveal that each of them gathered a whole lot of votes!

However, the one entry that the community showered in upvotes the most is

**/u/Teddybeddy with the gorgeous work [Swaeg Master](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6m3rb9/rbangtan_10k_special_event/djynxst/)
!** Congratulations!

[](#ryan_bomb)

We will be sending the talented winner a BTS album of their choice. Well be in touch about the details privately.

A big thank you to everyone who participated in our special event! This concludes our little celebration for 10k subscribers. It has been fun!

In addition, we have **a couple of announcements** to make.

#The weekly fanart thread will be discontinued.

We did a trial run with the weekly fanart thread [proposed in this announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6e21gw/170529_subreddit_updates/) a while back. It has now run for five weeks and, despite our efforts, has revealed itself to not be a suitable addition to the subreddit.

We will be directing fanart into the ongoing weekly thread for the few days until it has run its course, but after its conclusion, **fanart will be allowed as their own submissions on the subreddit again.** We will revisit this topic if there's continuous demand from the community for it.

In its stead, we would like to propose...

#A weekly question thread / redirect to the /r/bangtan room.

We get a lot of small questions (e.g. identification of clothing items, sourcing pictures, even yes/no questions etc.) on the sub that tend to be easily answered, yet often heavily downvoted. We would like to concentrate these type of questions on one place and would like the community's opinion on either **a weekly question thread** or **redirecting simple questions in the weekly /r/bangtan Room**.

That's it for now! Let us know if you have any other questions, feedback or suggestions. Thank you once again, and have a wonderful day. &lt;3",7,29

I had this frustrating conversation with someone I knew who likes kpop. We're not that close-close so this person doesn't know I'm an ARMY. Anyway, our talk deviated to kpop and she asked me what are the songs that I like. I name dropped a few BTS songs (Fire, Save Me, Spring Day, BST) and she went like ""oh, you know, BTS will never be big if *insert group name here* didn't go into hiatus"". She even has this theory that had that other group been active all these years, BTS would probably never make it this far. I dunno if that person is having delusions of grandeur but in her mind, the success BTS is having could have been that other group's, if they did not have that long break. She also thinks that BTS has stolen a lot of this other group's fans during their hiatus. She's also quite suspicious if I used to be a fan of that group but pretending not to be. My short bus ride home became a long and winding one thanks to this person. But before I left I made sure to let her know I'm an ARMY and proud. She'll probably never talk to me again if she sees me at the bus. 

I did my homework and I have this huge headache after reading so much reaching posts. I wasn't into kpop during that time (not sure if it's 2014 or early 2015-ish, because I know BTS started gaining traction with INU) so it's quite hard to say my piece as I do not have the facts altogether. I think she wouldn't even let me had I started. She's just so aggressive about this topic for some reason.

Anyway, can somebody shed some light regarding this. I've read the other side of the story, but now I wanted to hear it from my co-lovelies.

I know a lot of people call HYYH and I Need U/Dope as their turning point but I feel while it was the song that pushed them to Korean relevancy, a lot of other boybands go through that hit song phase where they suddenly turn into flavour of the month.

For me, the ultimate turning point was Fire. Wasn't a fan then but I remember a lot of OG fans not feeling the song when it came out but I also remember seeing TONS of people getting converted at that point. The MV went low key viral and I feel for the first time that BTS seemed certain of what their group concept and direction is. Prior to that they alaays felt like a band riding on trends for me (they went hiphop when half of idol rookoes were doing it and INU was as public friendly as you can get) but Fire getting that polarizing reaction right after it came out made me realize they have come into terms of their identity as a group.

402,2017-7-17,2017,7,17,16,6nrlcc,Does anybody else really relate to Paldogangsan (Satoori Rap)? It's such a special song for me and I have such a soft spot for it,VforVendetTae,1500276510,"I'm Filipino and when I first heard and looked at the lyrics of Satoori rap, I fell in love so hard. 

I can relate so much to satooris cause we have the same situation in the Philippines. It isn't quite like in the US where different states have different accents. Here when you go to cities and provinces outside of the capital (Manila) where Tagalog is the main language (like Seoul dialect is the standard), you'll find that people speak in a somewhat wholly different language. It's still similar to Tagalog but different enough that it becomes almost a different language and accompanied by its own accent. I'm from the Southern part of my country and aside from Tagalog, I can also speak Bisaya (tough sounding like Busan satoori haha) and Ilonggo (sing-songy like Jeolla accent ayyy). **HOWEVER** the bad part is just like in Korea, there's kind of a stigma against speaking satoori when you're in the capital. People kinda side-eye you and I've had cases where people treat me like a total country bumpkin. 

I read [this](http://radiopalava.tumblr.com/post/66719457975/language-ideology-and-representation-in-btss) article that basically explains the cleverness and social implications behind Satoori rap and just- WOW. It was totallly relatable to me and my experiences in my country. 
&gt;the notion that judgments about ethnicity, education level, socioeconomic status, and even morality can be made about a person from the way they speak. 


That line really spoke to me cause it was just so **TRUE**. I've had people judge me because I stubbornly pushed thru speaking comfortably in my satoori. Listening to Yoongi and Hobi rapping proudly about their own respective home towns and accents just made me so happy because I just relate so much and honestly it was one of the major reasons why I'm actively pursuing to learn Korean and possibly even satoori haha. 

In any case, I just wanted to pour my feelings here because I don't think there's anywhere else where I can express these feelings and have people kinda relate to it, even a little bit? Is there anyone else here who feels the same way I do? ",25,54

Like...whaaaaaaat? I watched so many Fire stages, including both promotion stages and award shows, that I almost got sick of the song and I had to detox for a bit. And then I went to KCon LA. And then I was lucky enough to get seats to the WINGS tour. And I randomly went back today to re-watch the dance practice and FINALLY see J-Hope busting this crazy move and I'm just like...WTF. Just HOW did I ever miss this?!? HOW!?

So, fellow fans, I come to you, hat in hand, to request your generosity in helping me to spot other small but awesome details in performances/choreos/etc. that might have slipped my notice, because I hate to think that I've been inadvertently sleeping on any one member.

442,2017-7-19,2017,7,19,4,6o30zu,Reddit 101: An Illustrated Guide,Eren_,1500405400,"Hello, lovelies!

Since we have so many new members, and not all of you have used reddit before, the mods thought itd be a good idea to make a reddit 101 post to both teach you guys the ropes *and* remind the older users of our rules.

So here goes nothing.

[](#ryan_bomb)

***

#Reddit 101: An Intro Guide

I was going to write a huge post about this then remembered *wait* reddit already *has* a [101 intro in their help section](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200073949-Reddit-101).

*Wew, lad!* Time to read!

To clarify a few things, though:

##[1. Mum, how to Reddit?](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511479-What-is-Reddit-)

Well, little Jimmy, like everything in life, you first watch *then* try your hand at it. Watch how others interact, how to properly submit things, and what is or isnt allowed.

Remember [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times, folks!

##2. We have rules?!

I *know*, right?! Incredible! *Who knew?*

This subreddit, like any decent online forum, **has its own subset of [&gt;rules&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules)**

*BROOOOOOOOOOOO.*

*INCREDIBLEEEEEE.*

[](#jin_scream)

**Seriously, though:**

We are as transparent as possible when removing submissions and comments. We tell you exactly why and what rules you are breaking. 

If you feel like the rules are *unnecessary* or that *mods need to chill* or *this is annoying,* there are plenty of other places to discuss BTS in! Those places have no rules and youre more than welcome to use *all dat free speech, man*. Wew.

Using *I think this community is mature enough to discuss X* doesnt excuse breaking the rules. Were moderators and weve *seen* things. We remove lots of things you dont get a chance to see. Thats why things look so decent.

If you have any complaints about rules, if you feel like they need to change, or if you want new rules added **PLEASE PARTICIPATE IN ANNOUNCEMENT POSTS BY MEANS OF COMMENTING OR JUST SENDING US MODMAIL.** 

We moderate a *community*. This place is not made by us, its by all of you. We are here to listen and act accordingly. Make yourself and your opinion known, if you dont then theres really no reason to complain.

Like what you doing, man?

[](#jh_disgust)

We actually *do* listen to suggestions. We do our best to implement whatever you guys collectively decide. So yeah. **Please suggest and tell us things.**

##3. What do you mean we need to flair?!

*[Boi.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/183/604/ee9.png)* 

Think of flairs as tags.  They look useless, but when using our [Filter Posts by Category](http://i.imgur.com/9RXPWKL.png) in the sidebar, theyre actually quite useful.  [Look at this flair button.](http://i.imgur.com/qGAGZ6U.png) *Mmm, boi.*

Also, **please familiarise yourselves with [our flair system](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/flairs).**  Ive seen people use our *Announcement* flair, and that should only be used by mods for subreddit updates T-T

You *can* flair from mobile, too. Just download a better app. We have recommendations in the sidebar.

Flairs make looking for posts infinitely easier. Which brings us to our next point:

##4. What do we have title formats for?!

Same reason as above. It makes searching posts easier.

We have a section in [Da Rules](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/jtv_user_pictures/panel-92017410-image-cef2d2f7ae02c5b0-320-320.png) which explains exactly this. **You can see them [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_iii._submitting).**

It even says *PLEASE FLAIR YOUR POSTS* in big capital letters. Wew, lads.

We even have a [PLEASE FOLLOW CORRECT TITLE FORMAT](http://i.imgur.com/suaLl31.png) section in the submit page, as well as a [PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT ___](http://i.imgur.com/Z2B0bdA.png) in the submit page. 

*[Waow.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/313861681912741888.png)*

##5. We have a sidebar and menubar?!

*What do you mean, Eren?!*

Bro, *I know*. I didnt see it either ~~(even though I freaking added it to make your lives easier hahaha)~~.

But now I know its there and *its full of useful stuff*.

I mean, look at this [incredible sidebar](http://i.imgur.com/dLmXBRJ.png) and this [useful as heck menubar](http://i.imgur.com/YJbcRRQ.png). 

Pls explore.

##6. Whats a wiki?

Its a magical place full of resources. You can add your own pages if you have enough karma, too. Help a bro out.

[Go explore](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index).

##7. We have a search function?!

Yes. Please use it before asking questions. 

More often than not, your question has been asked and answered before. Thats also why we need formatting on post titles, so we can easily find them using our fabulous search function. [Look at this beauty](http://i.imgur.com/cuyBhiO.png). Wow, Im in love. 

Thanks, based reddit.

Before posting a new thread, **PLEASE MAKE SURE IT DOESNT HAVE AN ALREADY EXISTING ACTIVE ONE. IF IT DOES, PLEASE ASK YOUR QUESTION OR POST YOUR UPDATE LINK (SUBS/TRANSLATIONS) INSIDE.** Dont make the mods weep.

##8. Searching the NEW section before submitting posts.

If you hover the little space beside the A.R.M.Y. bomb Snoo, a [dropdown menu appears.](http://i.imgur.com/fl1AXSq.png) You can then see posts by order of:

* New;
* Top;
* Controversial;
* Hot;
* Rising;
* Other stuff no one cares about;
* *And* you can even access the wiki!!!111 *BOOOOY.* Incredible.

##9. Mods, what are they? What do they do? Where do they live?

Moderators are just subscribers like you. Often times they were chosen through mod applications (/u/llaverna, /u/juliancasablancas), were avid posters when the community was almost dead (/u/dorkprincess) or just had some skills useful to the sub (wow is that me). Theres also /u/automoderator, but we dont talk about him. Hes the black sheep of the family.

We do mod stuff while going about our day. We have jobs and uni to take care of, so sometimes it might take a little while to get to reports and things. 

Were scattered throughout the world. Lots of timezones here. Were still missing one, so thats why during X hours a ton of weird posts go un-removed.

We trust you guys to use *dat downvote button* in case a post or comment breaks the rules.

Also, pls report. That way we can remove stuff quicker.

##10. How do I contact the moderators or the subreddit?

Instead of PMing a mod individually, please use our [Message the Moderators](http://i.imgur.com/mzpqzlZ.png) button in the sidebar. That way any mod can answer your question quicker.

Alternatively, we also have a button in the menubar, although sometimes its removed to add a Weekly Room when we run out of Stickied Posts space (we can only have 2 posts stickied at once *weeps*).

##11. Why arent we allowed to post articles from X website?

Those websites earn money through your access. When you click their shitpost you give them $$$. If you absolutely have to post a link to their junk article, **do not submit it as link**. Instead, **please copy it and submit as a selfpost with the content of the article in the body and a small link at the bottom as SOURCE.**

Those articles will be automatically removed from now on.

##12. I wanna chat with other A.R.M.Y.s!

**We have an official Discord server for the subreddit.** If you wanna talk, make A.R.M.Y. friends or just watch livestreams together, you can just shoot a PM to the server username and say *howdy, Id like an invite link, please!*

Were currently invite only because some people keep finding us through Google, Facebook and wherever else and don't know how to properly behave. Were a subreddit Discord first and foremost.

Again, the Discord moderators are not the same as the subreddit ones (except for me, hi!). Theyre still subscribers, though.

You can find out more about Discord [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord).

##13. We cant spread rumours? Itll damage BTS? wHAT?

I know who knew rumours could damage someones career, huh? You learn something new E-V-E-R-Y-D-A-Y!!!

*So, I heard Jimin ___*

No.

[](#sg_hush)

This isnt a *BTS R KINGS!!!111 ONLY GOOD STUFF POSTED!!1 NO CRITICISM ALLOWED!!!1!11!1* or whatever place, but dont spread rumours. 

Criticism is allowed as long as you keep it civil, as long as you write it in a neutral manner and not childishly (ex.: *ugh i hate __s voice its so annoying* -- no) it can stay up. 

Also, stop fighting each other. This isnt a daycare. Were all adults.

Weve been [sending projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects) to BTS/BigHit since October 2016 so theyre more than aware of our little corner. 

As a reminder: 

&gt;**A good general rule is that if you wouldn't feel comfortable showing/talking about it with BTS themselves, you shouldn't post it here! BTS does know about this sub, as we send them [projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects) semi-frequently!**

##14. Why cant I share paid content which helps BTS pay their bills for free?!

*Bro.* Why do you think.

Support oppar, support your fun.

No money = no BTS.

No BTS = no fun.

You *cannot* share paid content, unless its been at least 3 to 6 months since it came out. Even then, you can only share videos of about ~1 minute and a couple of pictures. **Never** share huge chunks.

##15. Use R.E.S.

If you think reddit is too hard, you can use the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) extension (RES). If browsing from mobile, you can also use one of the better apps in the sidebar, they have more functions. 

##16. This theme/design is gross

Then make a new one for free and send us, thanks. I'm not a designer, I'm a systems analyst. Suggest something when we change themes in the designated thread. If you're not capable of suggesting changes then don't complain.

***

This has been your bitter Tech Support Guy. Now if you excuse me, I feel like I need a few bottles. Have a pleasant day, everyone.

But I'm FINALLY back from my exams! Have you missed the survivors? ^not ^really ^right^shhhhh Ready for the next survivor game?

I've decided to do the **japanese discography survivor** this time. Just like the korean discography rounds, alternate versions and remixes of already known songs aren't included, therefore **this round will only include the original japanese songs** - that means no japanese versions of any of their korean songs. I've also decided to group them all in a single survivor, since some of their japanese albums only have one original song (for example, the only new song on the RUN single is Good Day). Does everyone agree with this?

After this survivor we might do the japanese MV survivor next. And then... hmm.. maybe the dance/choreography survivor? I kind of lost count of how many survivors we had planned lmao, I'll have to dig my old posts to find out.

And just in case some of you are new to this sub or forgot how the survivor works, this is a game to determine which song we like best. All you have to do is
#vote for the song you like the least.
Whichever song gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds. Every round lasts 2~3 days (there's a new round every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.)

Without further ado, let's start the survivor! May the odds be ever in your ^(favourite song's) favour.

Homme is a pretty niche group so even a fraction of Army support would be really helpful, and they're very talented and deserve the attention.

Is this a plausible goal? I'm just wondering since it is highly unlikely BTS is going to get airplay. Lately, there seems to be organised groups fundraising from non-US ARMYs to donate money so ARMY from the US can bulk-buy the comeback title song digitally from iTunes and gift it to other US ARMYs who can't afford.

485,2017-7-20,2017,7,20,17,6oexcg,Young Forever Theory,i_am_one_i_am_all,1500539109,"This theory is based on ""I need u"", ""Butterfly Prologue"", ""Run"", and ""Young Forever"".

In I Need U, the members are all attempting suicide except for Rapmonster and Jin. Jin is seen holding 6 petals, which could portray the 6 members. But why didn't Rapmonster attempt suicide like the rest excluding Jin? Well, you can see him working at a gas station. That means that he is already mature unlike the others. Jin is seen alone all the time throughout the video. Does that mean that he is dead? But in some parts, he is with the members. That can mean that either Jin or the 6 members are thinking of being together again. During the ending of I Need U, V is seen taking a bottle of alcohol and killing a man with it. You can see that a girl that's possibly a bit younger than him is shocked. She is his sister. But why did V kill this man? This man is his father. The house that V enters was filled with alcohol bottles, and that can mean that V's father was a heavy drinker who could have abused V, his sister and his Mother. The members are also seen partying in the end, which means that they are celebrating something. Can they be celebrating their reunion? I think that they were. 

Now, the next video: Butterfly Prologue. In the butterfly prologue, the members are greeting V. Before they do, he wakes up on mattress next to an abandoned swimming pool. He finds a picture of his father and him, but his father is in black and white while he is in color. That shows how his father is now dead. The members greet V, and they begin to play around. They are all bonding after their celebration, but during that time, Jin was seen taking pictures of his friends. Then, he spots a butterfly. He goes into a trance while staring at it, and takes a picture of it. He then snaps back into reality and continues talking to his friends. At night, they all lay near a fire. Jin then pulls out a picture of the ocean, and he asks the members if the want to go there. They all agree and go. They all begin to enjoy themselves, when they notice that V had climbed up the ladder to a piece of wood that was built up. He runs and jumps into the water. I think that V was trying to get rid of the guilt of killing his own father. But what happened to him next? Nothing. It didn't work since he was dead and he couldn't kill himself after all. The prologue ends. Now, we start with Run. In Run, the Video starts with V falling into the water and disappearing. I think that this means that he is drowning in his guilt. 

Then, it cuts to Rapmonster. He is the mature one. He is seen walking to a train cart. He knocks on it and the boys greet him. They are still partying, but why is V acting different? He seems to have been more rebellious ever since he killed his father. But why did Jungkook and Suga fight? What caused Suga to throw the chair at the mirror? I think that the mirror represents their life without Jin, and how he wanted to destroy that. He fought Jungkook because maybe Jungkook didn't want to accept the fact that they killed themselves to be together in the after life. So Suga wanted him to accept it. Throughout the video, you can see that there are small cuts of V drowning. I think that the water is the guilt, and he is drowning in it. But after Run ends, V is seen rising out of the water. He has chosen to get over the guilt. 

Next video, and the last one: Young Forever. Young Forever starts with pictures and tapes of the members together. It's a memory. Rapmonster begins to sing, and he hangs on to a rope. Is that rope the friends that he can't let go of? I think that it is, and that's why he let's go of it. He chose to be able to stay away. But then, more memories begin to play. At Suga's part, they show the pictures being burned. Those memories together are now gone. It then shows a clip of Suga's suicide when he burned his motel room. The vid begins to show more of the members suicide, which proves that they really are dead. Suddenly, they start running. They can't accept the fact that they are apart and their memories are fading. Guess what? The Butterfly Prologue was just a memory. It was during their death. Now that they really are dead in Young Forever, they are trying to find each other. Their memories together are gone since they are dead, so they want to be together and make memories again. In the end, they are seen running together. They have found each other. They died together, and now they ended up together in the after life. My theory might be incredibly wrong, but I just wrote what I think. The End",3,13

Wanted to see if there's anyone on here who would like to go with me (I'm female, in my 20s), since well, I'm selling just 1 ticket that's seated right next to mine, and besides I'd really much prefer to go for this with a fellow fan than go alone. So if anyone's interested, please holler at me over here! I promise I'm friendly and don't bite lol.   


Also, if the price is a problem, I MAY be able to get my friend to sell it for cheaper or something, since this is rather last minute. Just feel free to ask me if you have any questions.

For fun, I thought I'd try to build an app for **reaction videos**. I wanted to see if BTS fans would be interested! Here's how it would work:

**Create**

Our app keeps an up-to-date library of the latest viral videos from YouTube. To make a reaction video, choose a video from our library, press record, and react - we'll combine the original video and your reaction into the final video.

**Watch**

I'm gonna call the video you react to - the **original video**.

- Keeping on top of **original videos**:
    - Say there's a new original video you like, e.g. BTS Blood Sweat &amp; Tears. You can:
        - **Visit** the original video's page to see all its reaction videos 
        - **Follow** the original video's page to be notified whenever new reactions to it are posted
        - **Browse** trending reactions to that original video
        - **Crown 'winning reactions'** - vote for the 'best reaction' to an original video. Winners get stuff like badges for their profiles :)
        - **Sort reactions by type** - filter by Funny, Serious, Dramatic, Group, Solo, etc. to find the reaction types you enjoy
    - You can also browse to see **Trending, New, and Top original videos** - the ones lots of people are reacting to
- Keeping on top of **original creators**
    - Similarly to original videos, you can browse and follow **original creators** like BTS to keep track of all new reactions to BTS content 
- Every reaction video will have a **Request Box** where you can send the reactor requests for future reactions, and vote on others' requests
- **Crowd React** - watch an original video with multiple reaction videos playing over it at once. See how the crowd reacts!

What do you guys think?",33,19

We know next week there will be an overload of emoji related content so we also wanted to use the opportunity to create BTS Emoji Graphs!

We have used code by PRISMOJI to generate emoji graphs like [this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFSVmxeXgAEX3yR.jpg) but have modified the code to instead take BTS' tweets from their timeline and will also be using PRISMOJIs code based on hashtags 

Most importantly, we need to add emojis bts commonly uses to our emoji dictionary (which holds 842 emojis but is not extensive) so if you have emoji suggestion, please tell us so we can add them to our emoji dictionary!

Using the methods discussed, we will be releasing:

* Emoji graphs for each month between January 2017 to June 2017 @btw_twt

* An emoji graph for the first-half of the year @btw_twt

* Emoji graphs based on the emojis ARMYs use for each member's hashtag (ex: #jungkook)

* Emojis based on each member designed by my friend

* We will also be taking hashtag requests but we can only generate between 1-2 graphs a day because of twitter's streaming api limitations

We hope you guys like our idea! 

The main point is to build an emoji dictionary that will best represent BTS!

I am hoping to attend their fansigns for BTS' next comeback. I've looked through past posts and know that a lot of ARMYs buy a lot of CDs hoping to win the lottery. A few questions for any ARMY that has been to their fansigns recently:

1. Is 1 ticket only allowed to admit 1 person? I've seen fancams where a mom and daughter attend them together so I was wondering if that meant that each of them won 1 ticket each? Or?

2. Sadly, I know very little Korean, I was wondering if anyone had any trouble understanding directions/instructions from staff members when trying to line up, etc at the fansign event?

3. Are there any restrictions on international ARMYs attending fansigns in Korea? Would I have the same chance as Korean ARMYs as long as I buy enough CDs? How many CDs did you have to buy for a chance to win the tickets?


Thank you very much everyone! I've been lurking on the sub for a good few months and everyone here is so helpful. :)

537,2017-7-23,2017,7,23,12,6ozdhg,Do you think that being an ARMY affects your mental health?,pineapplefeline,1500782138,"First of all, I understand this might be a sensitive topic for some people, so I'm hoping that this thread will stay a safe place for people if they should choose to contribute. 

I came across [this](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/psychologists-say-fandoms-are-amazing-for-your-mental-health) article on how being part of a fandom can have a positive effect on your mental health. I'm wondering if anyone would like to share examples of how ARMY has had a positive or negative effect on you (or your mental health) since the fandom is so big, quite diverse, and very active. 

A few things I pulled from the article to summarize:

* a weak sense of belonging is correlated with depression, and fandoms can create a sense of belonging and community

* this is particularly important for adolescents

* there is a fine line between being fandom/obsession, and this can be easily crossed

My two cents: the research primarily focuses on fandom effects towards adolescents, so I'm not sure if the effects are proven to be the same with adults. However, speaking as someone who's relatively new to the fandom, my experiences as an ARMY have been overwhelmingly positive. Having a community to engage with about something I really love and seeing others so passionate about something we have in common has actually inspired me to take more risks and try to do things I've always wanted to do. 

Do you think being an ARMY has any effect on your mental health? 

Edit: I'm bad at formatting. 

Edit #2: Wow, thank you so much for the gold, kind stranger! I hope people have found this discussion worthwhile. I know that mental health is a tough thing to talk about sometimes, but I'm glad to see people use this forum to share their thoughts. There are also lots of resources online for bettering your mental health, and remember self care extends to your physical being as well. 

I'm going through everyone's responses slowly, but I am taking the time to read all of them- in the meantime, take care of yourselves! ",90,71

So we can see from the Bon Voyage sleeping arrangements (which they made a big deal about) that some members share a bed together. The 4th birthday party also reveals that most of them have a roommate, except for Jungkook who won a single room with rock-paper-scissors.

This may be me being super ethnocentric about personal space and privacy norms, but is anyone surprised that they are still rooming together in their dorm/sharing a big bed at this point? I'm especially surprised because they are presumably much better-off financially at this point. Can't they afford to each have a room in their dorm or each have their own bed while on the Bon Voyage tour? Or is sharing private space a complete non-issue for them?",43,26

Hi~~

How's everyone's summer going^(or winter, for those of you living in the Southern hemisphere)?

Whether you're out basking in the sun, having fun, chilling, going to school, or working, we hope y'all are safe and happy.

We don't want to take too much of your time, so we'll try to make this post as short as possible. However, if something's not clear and you guys have any questions feel free to message or PM us :)

About^(meehh) roughly 2 weeks ago, we started accepting submissions for the birthday projects we are planning for both our Golden Maknae Jungkook and our adorably dimply leader Namjoon. For those of you just joining us, we are basically planning to send a fan content compilation book to each of the boys on their birthdays. Each project has it's own theme, but you guys can send fan letters, fan art, photographs (granted, they must be your own work, or you must have permission to use them) in general. Below, we have summarized the gist of each project, and provided an update regarding the charity donations:

&amp;nbsp;

##[Jungkook's project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project)

Since in the past Kookie has mentioned he likes photography, we have **a photography ""map"" theme** for this project. We will be grouping photographs (and their respective entries - fan art or letters) depending on where the image was taken (and fan art and letters by the location of the sender). We made [some mock templates](https://imgur.com/a/TeAYq) for you guys so you can get a rough idea of what we envision.

Paired with this project is a **charity donation to BAPS** (Busan Abandoned Pet Sanctuary) that will be our gift to JK, as he has [mentioned](http://www.vlive.tv/video/17071) wanting to help abandoned dogs in the past. [BAPS](http://shindogs.org/) is known for being *a no-kill based animal sanctuary in Busan that focuses on re-homing abandoned dogs*. They do a lot of good work in helping abandoned dogs at a shoestring budget, including vaccinating all their dogs, providing medical care and a safe space for their dogs until they are adopted. Since we can't all go to Korea, and we're all spread out across the world to coordinate effectively, we will be making a donation on his name from us here at the sub. 

&amp;nbsp;

##[Namjoon's project](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e7j/rms_17_birthday_project)

For Namjoon's birthday project we will be doing **a fan version of his #RMusic recs, #ARMYMusic**. The entries will be styled like a tweet, since that's how he usually shares music with us...besides dancing like an adorable dork on Vlive. You guys will still be able to send fan art, fan letters, and photographs, regardless. [This is the layout design we have in mind](https://imgur.com/a/JmCdL).

We will also do a charity donation in his name to **[WE Charity/Free the Children](https://www.we.org/)**, as we wanted to make a donation to a charity focusing on [furthering children and youth education](https://www.we.org/gb/about-we-charity/about-us/). In Africa, Asia and Latin America, they partner with communities to help empower them through a holistic, sustainable international development model to help break the cycle of poverty, especially so that all children and youths have access to education and don't have to work to ensure their family's survival. They also have educational programs in the UK, US and Canada to inform students and give them the tools to create transformative social change. 

&amp;nbsp;

##Deadline and other info

Please see the full posts for both projects on how to make submissions. Both projects close at the same time, **6 August at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL time**. You can use [this time zone converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) to find out what time the deadline translates to in your time zone. We will also be sending a [reminder tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/rbangtan_armies) and posting a [calendar reminder](https://www.localendar.com/public/r_bangtan) a week before the deadline and 3 days before submissions close. Please try to send in your entries as soon as possible so that we can revise and place your entry accordingly. If you know in advance or think you might be a late submitter, let us know when we can expect your entry; then, that way we can send you a reminder and we know to wait for your submission.

As always, **the coordinating team will try to cover all printing+shipping costs**. However, if you'd like to help us cover the costs you can do so [here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). **We are using the same link for both projects for covering shipping costs and for charity donations** so we ask that you please specify what you want your money to go towards in the comments box. We have made [a guide here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-hQrLJ_SjRPwO8jxx) but in summary, please leave a note specifying the project you'd like to donate to, your contact details and credit in the following format: 

**PROJECT(s) (write any comments here, including if you would like to split your donation) / CONTACT (email or Reddit username) / cr: CREDIT (name(s) and username(s) you would like your donation to be credited towards)**

For example, if I wanted to donate to the RM project, I would write *RM project / u/BTSprojects / cr: Coordiunnies Team* in the comment box. 

If you would like to split your contribution to both projects, please specify the projects involved and how you'd like to split your contribution (e.g. JK + RM projects (50:50)). 

The deadline for donations for both projects will close at **15 August at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL time**. 

Any excess money we receive to help us cover printing + shipping costs will be entirely donated to the paired charity for each project.

&amp;nbsp;

Alrighty, that's it for now! Thank you to all of you who have already submitted content ^ u ^ We haven't been able to send everyone a confirmation message yet, due to the number of submissions; however, please give us until the end of the first week of August to send out everyone a message :)

Thank you guys for reading all the way through. Stay safe and hydrated ^(or bundled, if it's cold where you live), and we hope to see many more of you guys participate ^ u ^

I live in the states.  I wanted to buy the new Puma shoes but I didn't want to ask anyone in my family from Korea because they never accept my money, even when I insist on paying for all the items and shipping- which is awesome, but as a grown, working adult, I don't want to use them like that.  So I was thinking about doing one of those group orders (which I have never done) but today I saw this instagram post:  https://www.instagram.com/p/BW9Bi2klsVf/?taken-by=koreanbuddy  

The site is a Korean personal shopping service that I have seen people over at r/asianbeauty use and also, Jhope's sister recommended them for international orders from her store.  The shoes are sold out online but this service seems to have bought some already and apparently, Puma will restock in a few days.  

I'm still on the fence about using them so I was wondering if anyone has ever used their services?",17,20

I've been a casual kpop fan for several years, and didn't really get into BTS until recently, and this is my first time in any sort of fandom, so it's been quite overwhelming to see this amount of people.

Since I don't know many people that are into BTS or even kpop in real life, I thought it would be a good idea to have a group chat to meet some fellow A.R.M.Y, to chat about BTS, kpop, and just random stuff. I don't really use any messaging app, so I'm down to join whatever people prefer :)

Sure the fandom has grown, but how are we sure that most of the new fans will be *buying* fans? Most of BTS news fans post-BBMAs are from Western countries (US, Canada, Australia) wherein physicals aren't a big thing. I'm guessing we'll do well with the whole Youtube/Spotify/iTunes aspect but I'm scared that we might be overestimating and end up disappointed. I'm anxious that most fans will be busy tallying numbers when CB comes instead of enjoying the whole thing.

There's another big K-Pop fandom recently whose faves had a comeback and while that comeback was successful in itself, they failed to break some records they tried to set and I saw some of their fans blaming each other. This early on even without the CB yet, so many ARMYs are already scolding fellow ARMYs for being ""lazy"" to vote for Bilboard, Soribada, Brand Awards. I know BTS never disappoints and always manages to outdo expectations, but I always like leaving a margin of error here and there.",72,69

I don't sing myself, but I had some secondhand experience on it (few music classes, one of my exes sings), and I thought it kind of looked like, even though it sounded as nicely as always, he was forcing it a bit (looking at his throat's muscles and curving his body to make the notes go higher). As I said, I'm not a singer myself, so I may be way off, but I wanted to ask if anyone here with some more technical knowledge can tell me if Bangtan's been taking proper care of their vocal chords. I really like their voices and I'd be very frustrated if they ended up not being able to sing their older songs as well in the future, as often happens with musicians who start out young and without proper technique.",40,23

I wasn't even paying attention to his eyebrows before he brought attention to it, to me he looks perfectly normal and happy. I wanted somebody to tell him that it's fine to look like that. I expected the other members to say something, letting him know that it doesn't even matter. What surprised me next was that the other members suggested to him to get a brow tattoo. That seriously shocked me, they're thinking that having pale eyebrows is some kind of defect, that it needs to get fixed! What struck me further is the realization that I'm being affected by the beauty standards shown through Kpop more than I realized. I thought I was above it. I also have extremely pale eyebrows, in real life it looks normal but in photos I look like I don't have eyebrows. I was fine with my eyebrows before but after seeing many Kpop MVs, I started to draw in my eyebrows every morning before I go out. But the thought of having someone else pointing out I have pale eyebrows and suggest I try to fix it makes me feel a bit sick. I thought it's strange how I think JHope looks normal with his light eyebrows, yet think it's not normal for myself to have light eyebrows, putting pressure on myself and draw it in everyday. I remember recently, Jimin said he went on a diet and had no energy to dance, to the point of falling on the floor. What disturbed me is that Jimin was proud of his unhealthy diet, even fully understanding the effects. Fans cheered him on because some of them liked him skinny. The other day I saw some pictures of Wendy from Red Velvet, how she was dancing and smiling, and showing full ribs below her tank top. 

What are fans doing to these idols? What are the idols doing to themselves? What are some of us doing to **ourselves**? Is any of you being negatively affected by the beauty standards you see through Kpop? What did you do? What are your opinions?",27,28

Also no need for it to be strictly music.

I always feel Jungkook has enough appeal to be sorta like Justin Bieber if he lands a good Western collab. Him being unable to speak English might even possibly add to his charm because it will make girls think he's such an enigma. I know people like aiming for the Selena and Arianas but I honestly think a Hailee Steinfeld x Jungkook of BTS collab produced by Zedd/David Guetta would be a smashing hit. There's something about their voices and auras that seem to match.

I'm so down for a Hobi x Tinashe dance stage.

I actually want Tae to do a photography collab at some point with Ante Badzim and other post-modern photographers. His photos are so soulful. Also Tae looks like he can be a male lead in an Adele music video.

I think Suga's songs will be well-received in the US, it's definitely their style. I hope he can write for Demi Lovato or something, their musical wavelengths are roughly similar.

I somehow imagine Rap Mon doing well in a public-friendly multi-artist collab like I'm the One. He could also do a rap for a Halsey feature.

Jimin's voice really suits to be a hook in a Calvin Harris/Chainsmokers club banger. If they can release a vid of him dancing it then that's a winner.

I still think Jin will be that one member scoring the fashion deals because the West, especially non-fans who never saw BTS stages, seem to love his aesthetic so much.

690,2017-7-30,2017,7,30,17,6qgbtk,What goals do you hope BTS would achieve before they enter military?,savingmyjams,1501402513,"Just because I have realized Jin is due to serve before 2021 ends, so I assume 2021 will be the last year OT7 will be active together, with the possibility of a long group hiatus unless Jungkook decides to serve earlier so the group can comeback asap. Kook isn't due to serve until 2026 and if he waits till then, he will only be out by 2028. 7 years with no Bangtan (2021-2028) might happen.

Before thiss timeframe happens,  I feel the boys have 2021 to really establish their group brand. I know people are saying they should establish solo careers but acting gigs pay peanuts in Korea ($8000/ep even if you're a lead) and unless they really blow up as actors, it issnt worth it. 

I still feel touring is where it's gonna be for them but even as solo acts, the BTS brand will be crucial (see Big Bang and the solo acts of tthe members). My wish for them is to really establish their global concert audience by continuously touring worldwide because it will be thee same audience who will be excited to see them back post military (see TVXQ/JYJ filling arenas with little promo)

Also really expand their discography to give us more timeless hits we can listen to while they're away

Lastly, hope they can win a prestigious music award in the US/Europe and get some legit Western validation forr their music and performances (a Grammy World Artist Award is too delulu but a new artist award from Bilboard would be awesome)",71,49

BTS Merch emailed me back last night. Apparently even though the caps were NOT sold out when I bought them, they were actually sold out. I'm kind of confused because they were still up on the site AFTER my payment was processed. They were on for several minutes even.

Pretty annoyed that they didn't say anything until the email I sent them. I was refunded the portion for the 3 caps so yea.
