Anyways, I was surprised to see this one though! Don't know if this was already posted but if anyone's interested, the whole magazine is about BTS -- loads of articles, big images too and some posters I think\~ It was pretty thick\~ Found it at Shoppers! I didn't buy it though because I was supposed to be buying food hehe\~ But now I'm curious, I should've taken time to read some of the pages.....

Im a relatively new fan, while my sister has been a fan for a while, so the first song I heard was her favourite, The Truth Untold. I went back and watched a bunch of their MVs, but it was definitely Blood Sweat &amp; Tears that did it for me. I absolutely loved the whole thing. I didnt really know what biases were back then, but JKs adorably crooked smile propelled him to that spot lol

-What did you think of it at first?

-What do you think of it now?

-Did your opinion of the song change?

For me, I honestly didnt like it at first and thought it was very generic. I think I actually turned it off before listening the whole way through . But after giving it a few more listens, Ive grown to like it a lot more. Obviously its not what were used to from the guys but I think thats to be expected as its not their song. Its a good way to get them some more exposure from the mainstream radio stations and audiences.

Either way Id like to hear what others think.

One of my guy friends checked out BTS when they went on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and said, ""I find their leader very engaging. He strikes me as the most talented guy in the group, frankly, and he also seems like the most genuine artist. Whenever they talk, some of the other guys seem like arrogant ditzes, but he comes off as smart, level-headed, and authentic...Actually, maybe it's just J-Hope (who is an arrogant ditz)."" I defended J-Hope, of course -- he is my ultimate bias wrecker, after all -- but it made me wonder what other people's first impressions of J-Hope were. I particularly want to hear from people who were first exposed to BTS through Western media. 

Personally, I fell for Suga first (my bias) and then got wrecked by Hoseok in BST, Mic Drop, and pretty much every live performance I've seen online and in person.

BTW, my friend was not completely uncomplimentary of J-Hope. He also noticed his awesome dance skills, but that didn't stop him from wanting to punch Hobi in the face.  ",144,1

I'm getting rid of some of the stuff I have acquired here in Korea. I'm not in the best position and don't want to tell mom yet. :(  
  
This is all of my personal stuff I have purchased here. Some of it's already bubble wrapped as it's been sitting in my suitcase. I'd owe you tremendously if you purchased anything. It'd help a lot.  
  
The two prices you see regard shipping. The first is surface mail; mail that goes on a boat. This can take 1-2 months. Some countries do not qualify for surface, so we'll have to check before we continue (I know Belgium is one of them). The second is airmail, which takes about a week or so. Both include tracking numbers. I am shipping out of Korea by the way.

I might be able to discount shipping rates if you purchase multiple items; it depends on the size though. I can for sure if you purchase a BT21 item and live photos. You would pay the $18/$22 USD price, rather than the $32/$45 as shipping from the BT21 item would cover something as small as the photos.

This was originally supposed to include Citi Field, but it got so gosh-darn long that I think Ill post that as a separate fan account at some point. Lots of crazy stuff at Citi Field. Camping out, making extended stage barricade front + center, watching rapline perform Tear fifteen feet away from me *(sweats)*, all that jazz.

Without further ado

**Before the Concert, 9/28**

I woke up around 9:00, blearily packed my little drawstring concert bag, and boarded the subway to Manhattan. I spent the whole morning wandering the city with a group of wonderful new reddit friendswe hit the LINE store and picked up our free balloons, traveled down to Canal Street for ice cream and K-pop merch, then circled back up to Korea Town where we went hunting for *more* K-pop merch and had a delicious lunch. Around 3:00, it was time u/marrimar and I split off from the group (all of who were attending the following night's show) and after getting ourselves briefly lost in the claustrophobic labyrinth of Penn Station, we were on the train headed towards Newark.

**Arrival in Newark**

Upon [arrival to the Prudential Center](https://imgur.com/io4exwa), I spent some time wandering around the tents and lines in awe, amazed to be surrounded by so many fellow fans for the first time in my life. It was a gloomy daygray skies, chilly and drizzlingbut there was a thrum of excitement running through the masses. We hung out at a nearby bar for a couple of hours, lined up at the entrance around 7:00, were whisked through security in under fifteen minutes, and took an escalator up to the arena.

**Moment of Truth**

I will never forget what it felt like stepping into the arena for the first time. The massive size of the space, and the sound of the crowd, were breathtaking. The Prudential Center is quite tall, so from my P2 seat it felt like being at the bottom of a [giant funnel encrusted with twinkling lights](https://streamable.com/1p3sq). 

Let it be known that I did not actively seek out the setlist for the show, although I was unable to keep myself off twitter and ended up knowing most of it anyways.

**IDOL, Save Me, Im Fine, Magic Shop**

* When the members came out for IDOL, it took my brain some time to adjust to what I was witnessing. The crowd roared, and after months and months of seeing this group through screens, it was too much of a jump to understand fully that they were right there, real people, right in front of me. I remember clutching my little ARMY bomb keychain to my chest and mouthing what the fuck? at the stage for at least, like, a solid two minutes.  
 
* I unexpectedly broke down into tears when the first notes of Save Me hit. [Im Fine and Magic Shop](https://streamable.com/j3i7z) were an absolute blur. I have an image emblazoned on my mind of Taehyung bobbing happily up and down during Magic Shop with the purest expression of joy Ive ever seen on a human being spread across his face. 

**Just Dance, Euphoria**

* Just Dance knocked me out of whatever weird liminal headspace Id been in since the start of the concert. The hall filled with beautiful pinks and oranges and reds, then dissolved into incredible white strobe lights during the dance breakI stood there in slack-jawed awe. Halfway through the song, I realized that an incredibly solid feeling of pure, unadulterated happiness had crept up on me. It stuck around.  
 
* More slack-jawed awe at the transition between Just Dance and Euphoriathe notes shifting, the backup dancers seamlessly adjusting formation to welcome Jungkook to the stage. 

** Note**

Something interesting happened right around this part of the concertI really started to feel the narrative flow of the setlist, and once I became attuned to this flow my perspective of the show shifted in a way I had not anticipated. It felt much less like I was attending a grand musical celebration and more like I was attending a play. 

Ive spent countless hours familiarizing myself with the public personas of these seven people and, obviously, the music they perform is aligned closely to their very real-life experiences and identities. However, for most of the concert, my more fannish attachment receded and I saw BTS rather impartially as actors putting on a spectacularly moving show. Love Yourself is a beautiful story documenting a journey of emotional maturity, and it really is a *story* with a beginning, a middle, and an end. They certainly made it feel like one.

****

**Serendipity, Trivia:Love, DNA, Medley** 

* I have no idea how Jimin, the prodigiously sparkly housefly-sized man that he was from where I was seated in row 22, still managed to compose such a spellbinding figure from [so far away](https://streamable.com/bxs5d)like the most elegant tiny thing on the planet. Ive no particular emotional attachment to Serendipity, but by the last chorus I was weeping from the sheer beauty of the deep longing encased in the lyrics and melody. (I cried again on Saturday, and again at Citi Field, and internalized those three crying-at-Serendipity experiences to such an extent that I cry whenever I listen to Serendipity, now. God damn it.)  
 
* Trivia: Love is one of my favorite BTS tracks of all time, so I was incredibly excited to [see it live](https://streamable.com/4ysgd). It threw me for an absolute loop though, because, uh. The line I live so I love hit me like a ton of bricks and I started sobbing uncontrollably halfway through Namjoons performance. Just the idea that love is an integral part of being alive, something accessible to us at all times no matter how dark things may get. Its a wonderful thing to think about.   
 
* Seeing them perform DNA on the extended stage felt like watching a movie, or a videofor some reason this was the song that felt the most surreal so far to see live. They absolutely sparkled. (Like, the dancing was mesmerizing, but also their outfits were very super sparkly.)  
 
* The medley was insane. At this point my adult self was absolutely acting like more of a lunatic than the clearly much younger girls surrounding me. I was totally okay with that. Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears gave me the weirdest chills. Go Go was exuberant. Boy in Luv and Danger were intense and loud. I barely remember Dope. Wild. 

**Airplane Pt. 2, Singularity**

* Airplane Pt.2 is an absolutely amazing transition to the darker side of the setlist. I think the switch flipped the second it endedall of a sudden the bubbly happiness of the first set of tracks transitioned into this atmospheric chill, like the moment when the sun disappears behind the clouds. It was so creepily satisfying.  
 
* (If you were a security guard standing at the entrance to Section 7 approximately 10 seconds into the Singularity VCR you would have seen a blur of a figure sprint up the stairs, crawl under the curtain, hesitate for a split second while deciding whether or not to parkour over a bar table blocking the exit, decide not to parkour over the bar table, sprint desperately towards a non-blocked exit, barrel to the womens bathroom, sprint out the door thirty seconds later, and be back in their seat with fifteen seconds to spare before the next performance. Easily the most stressful two minutes of my life.)  
 
* For most of the show Id been watching the tiny figures of the BTS members move around the stage, but for Singularity I watched the big screens to soak in as much as I could of Taehyungs expressiveness. A very special performance, with everyone at the edge of their seats.

** Note**

In our day-to-day lives as participants in a community of fans experiencing a live event from many different places that are not where the live event is taking place, we share the videos and read the tweets and watch the periscopes, feeding off each others excitement and wit in a grand frenzy on social media. Every little piece of real-time content is filtered through this never-ending stream of stimulating commentary, like were living within and through each others minds and voices. Like, the commentary *becomes* the concert, becomes the experience.

Actually *being* at the concert, however, was different. I didnt have the voices of thousands of fans echoing through my brain as I took in BTSs performanceI couldnt, because thats not how concerts work, and Id turned off all notifications on my phone right before the show. Surrounded by 20,000 screaming fans, Id never felt more like my experience of BTS was entirely my own. It took me by surprise, almost. I just remember thinking, oh, this is interestinglyquiet. An unexpected silence (or absence) in the midst of so much noise. 

**** 

**Fake Love, Trivia: Seesaw**

* That night (and the next night, and at Citi Field too) Fake Love had an special intensity that left a real impression on me. I cant remember a song during the show where I was more laser-focused on what was happening onstage or more present in the moment.  
 
* Seesaw felt intensely joyful and celebratory, a clear fan favorite. I felt the connection to the audience around me so strongly throughout. Something about the beat of the song, or the low bass, or the reverberative quality justit synced all of us up so beautifully.

**Epiphany, The Truth Untold**

* I have to give a very special shoutout to Epiphany. It was an absolute showstopper. Forget the rest of the concertI would pay $200 for a ticket just to see Jin perform Epiphany. Once. I cant even describe what it was, to witness that performance. Im holding it very close to my heart, still. Every single thing in my life melted away until there was only the lights, the cheers, the instrumentation, Jins voice.   
 
* Aside from the performance of Epiphany, the single most beautiful thing I experienced all evening might have been the sound of 20,000 soft voices [humming along to The Truth Untold.](https://streamable.com/t703s) Iif you asked me for which part of the concert I wish I could experience just once again, it would be these two songs back-to-back. 

**Outro: Tear, MIC Drop**

* During Tear I just stood there spellbound, thinking this is perfect. The green lights. The beat. It felt like a dream. Mic Drop was the same. I cant remember specifics; I just remember this intense feeling of being immersed in something unbelievable, almost surreal.

**So What, Anpanman, Love Yourself: Answer**

* After the end of the main part of the show, it felt like the narrativethe storyended with it in a sense. Like I was just seeing BTS as excitable personalities, performers dancing and meandering around the stage as themselves. The awe melted away into joyful familiarity. I remember staring at each member in turn and thinking about how much Id built them up in my mind. Standing there in amazement that these were those people, the actual real people whose joys and sorrows and antics Id been following so long from so far away.   
 
* So What and Anpanman were so incredibly joyful. I dont know what else to say. Pure joy. It felt like we (BTS included) were just a bunch of humans having an absolute blast and basking in the inherent beauty of music and performance and life. Love Yourself:Answer, too. I cant remember ever grinning that hard in my entire life. The confetti fluttering down, the bright lights, the happy yells and cheers and the final goodbye were all so pure and joyful. 

I left the venue in an absolute daze. Almost speechless. On the train ride home I kept listening to all the tracks Id just heard performed live in front of my face and being profoundly moved by all of them, more than Id ever been before. I have a distinct memory of sitting on a near-deserted Q train, crossing the bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn, staring out at the glittery city landscape absolutely overcome with emotion from something I was listening toSerendipity, maybe, or Epiphany. I fell into bed at 3:00 AM and conked out immediately.

# Day 2, 9/29

So, I should probably preface this by mentioning that there wasnt supposed to be a day two. 

Like, I did not have a ticket for 9/29, and I was not planning on getting a ticket for 9/29. Butas soon as I walked out of that venue on Friday I knew, I just *knew,* that day two was happening or so help me god. 

**Before The Show**

I was up and on the train to Newark by noon the following day, still ticket-less. My plan was to pick up a cheap resale ticket right before the show or grab something from the box office for face value. After a few hours of praying for $60 tickets (which popped up the day before around two hours before the show) I decided to bite the bullet and grab a P3 from the box office. Boom.

The main difference between the first and second days is that the second day I was with a pretty large group of peoplemaybe nine or ten peopleall of us reddit folks from all over the country who came together for the show. We got delicious pizza and hung out at a bar and generally had an absolute blast pre-showtime. One of my fondest memories of the night was actually right after we all went through security and got our tickets scanned. We all just stood in a circle going This is it. Its time. This is really happening. 

Once I [entered the venue](https://imgur.com/BCM7xki), I found out that my seat was facing the stage head-on, and also the very last row on the floor. Like, I was sitting in an actual folding chair! I stayed there for the first couple tracks but then my buddy in P1 alerted me to the fact that there was an empty seat next to her so I uh. Skedaddled over during the first VCR and stayed there for the rest of the show.

I wont run through all the songs again, but I did jot down some sporadic thoughts and impressions about the second concert so Ill share those. 

**The Second Concert**

It felt very much like a continuation of the first day. I think, when youre attending a show or event that youve been anticipating for such a long time, the big ball of expectation becomes so massive that it interferes with your ability to process the thing as it is actually happening. Since this was my second time seeing the concert, I was more open to letting myself feel however I felt, less worried about not missing a single moment and maximizing the experience. Because of that, funnily enough, it felt like much more immersive than the first night. I just got swept up in that amazing concert feelinglike riding a rollercoaster, where the whole world narrows down to the present moment and you enter the flow of the performance and the crowd and all your 9-5 worries are totally dispelled from your consciousness.

* I was so close to the extended stage. I kept being starstruck by their faces. Jin, in particular, kept drawing my eye. 
* Just Dancemy brain short-circuited during the dance break. Like i was feeling a pulsing happiness throughout my body. That song is pure magic live.
* [DNA](https://streamable.com/ishru) was so fun the second day, so infectious.
* I absolutely lost my fucking mind when they started Boyz with Fun. Completely lost it. I was expecting them to do the same medley as the day before but then they did Boyz with Fun, which is the one track I have *always* wanted to hear them perform live, and I lost it.
* Again, entranced by Taehyung during Singularity. He is such a master emoter.
* [Fake Love was spellbindingly intense](https://streamable.com/9b7xq) once again. 
* Jins face on the big screen during Epiphany took my breath away. Completely. God. Epiphany, [Fucking epiphany.](https://streamable.com/dm1nj)

The encore was special, this time. The first day was goodit was amazingbut you could tell the members were more relaxed on the second day, and it showed. Their playfulness seemed so spontaneous. Totally in sync with the crowd. They were loosened up, so at ease, and the ments felt likelike we were parting as friends, people who knew each other intimately. Such warmth and camaraderie and giddiness. 

I have to give a shoutout to Taehyung, who, during Love Myself, decided he was going to have some fun with my side of the venue. [This adorable clip](https://twitter.com/VsnatchedMySoul/status/1046408162197159943) was being spread around twitter a while back and I just want to say, I was *right there*, you could probably spot me in the video if it were less grainy, and I remember the moment so clearly. He was hilarious.

I left the concert feeling incredibly warm. My friend group and I reconvened at a nearby bar, where we ate lots of yummy food and chatted excitedly about what wed just witnessed. A funny tidbitthe bar had a jukebox, and u/acadiamoon had the brilliant and selfless idea to spend some of her hard-earned money to play some BTS for the crowdand long story short, we got into a jukebox war with a bunch of football bros who kept countering our BTS songs with Totos Africa. Haha.

**Ultimate Takeaway**

I was blown away by the shows, both of them. Truly. Each individual performance was a universe. It felt like I was seeing a dream, a three-dimensional, holographic tribute to each of these songs that have become my treasured companions. The full majesty of the Love Yourself trilogy laid out in front of tens of thousands of people. It was also a little strange, because the songs and the people and the visuals are all so familiar to me, but the show was obviously an entirely different dimensional experience. It felt like an expression of a well-known and well-loved storybut expressed in a rendition so sprawling and fantastical it didn't even seem real.

I found myself walking away from the venue both nights feeling a deep sense of awe and respect. Sometimes, as I think we all do, I have these moments of clarity where I wonder if its really wise to be pouring so much of myself and my time into this entity, this BTS. Its a difficult question to face, even harder to answer, but after the show I really feltif anything, theyre worth it purely for the value of the art theyve brought into the world. It was just that good of a show. I'd love to conjure up a time-turner so I can relive it, but my [commemorative wall](https://imgur.com/wA6NQKz) will have to do for now. ;) 



I want to thank really quickly all the new friends I made who were such a huge part of what made this experience so greatMars, Mackenzie, Divine, Esther, Liv, Patrick, Rose, Shelby (I feel like Im missing a couple of names, but if you were part of the crew I know who you are and I love you!). Also, big shout out to my tiny little ARMY bomb keychain, which somehow survived the 48-hour madness fully intact. You are very strong and resilient and I love you too.

And to BTSthanks, guys, for being incredible and bringing into existence one of the best weekends of my life. Ill be seeing you again next year! ",14,1

We have a really good mix of ages here.  And even this small sample size tells us that the journalists writing about BTS has done a poor job of characterizing ARMY demographics.  

I'm really looking forward to the annual census this year, too, when it comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick story (skip down if you don't wanna hear about my feels):

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I first got into BTS, I was super homesick &amp; in a place I didn't really want to be. I ended up using BTS (and by extension, BTS merch) as a crutch to brighten my days until I could go back to the people I loved.  LY series came just as I started working on myself and my happiness and as I grappled with fact that my professional endeavors might pull me away from my friends and family geographically. I'm pleased to say that, emotionally, I'm in a much better place now.  So, I feel like I no longer need to hold onto some of the impulse purchases I made over the past few years and would like to provide them with new, loving homes. Although it's hard to say goodbye (looking at you YNWA, confetti boys version), I'm ready to let go ;)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please read carefully as not all albums come with the same goodies. Let me know if you're interested. I'm pricing everything at $20 plus shipping! I'm a little busy this weekend, but will get back to you when I can!

Shoes are unisex - size 7 Men size 9 women. Comes with original collectors box, tote bag, pins, the colourful  laces, and the Converse BT21 authenticity card. Price 275 or best offer. Paypal only. If you are in New York area I will be happy to meet so you can see and try them on. Payment - paypal preferred or if we are meeting cash is OK . But really, paypal is better for buyer and seller Ive heard. I hate selling this and Im half tempted to just wear thick socks and keep them. Its just that Im really a size 71/2 and they dont do half sizes there -/ so these are really too long. Heres the link if you wish to see pictures.

I am talking mostly about the more corny and child-ish concepts and not album or music concepts: BTS and the Magical Ingredient Skit, Flower Boys Bangtan, House of Army, Official Fanclub Material (BTS as princes, etc). Whenever I first see these types of concepts being done, I always think that it is cute and adorable. But then I remember I am in my mid-20s and so are most of these boys! Makes me wonder if they even like to do things like this (the 2nd Muster comes to mind when they are screaming with embarrassment at the dating simulator they did!) For me, I do like the skits if they are more humorous than flirty like House of Army. But having just watched the most recent Muster where the boys look a little too mature and grown up to be wearing those outfits lol, it does seem more cringe-y than before. And it feels apparent that these concepts are catering to younger fans. I know these types of things are very wide spread with Idol music, but does there come a point where groups are too old for this type of thing? ",0,1

128,2018-11-4,2018,11,4,8,9tyv6f,How do you feel about the amount of content BTS puts out?,kaitlyn76,1541288368,"A bit of a confession here... looking at the comments on the Jimmy Fallon performances, I see a lot of people saying ""Wow I'm gonna check them out now!"" ""Guess I should join the fandom"" etc. I'm like yay but also ahhhhh, they're gonna fall in this hole. I almost want to tell them man please don't. Please be careful. Compared to other bands and artists bts just has so much content. Like all these Run episodes, Bon Voyage, all their twitter posts, all the shows they've been on, all the vlive vlogs, performances, fanmade content, seriously it goes on and on. What western group/artist even comes close?! Like I have another (western) group that I like and I just listen to their music and follow them on social media. That's it. Doesn't take much of my time. But with bts I just want to watch them all day, every day. Just when I think I've watched every bts video in existence, new content comes out or I rewatch old content. They're very entertaining people!! I try to scale back or even try to forget bts exist and I fall right back in. If you're unemployed, don't work many hours or on break, it's seriously the worst. So many hours gone.

Anyone else with poor self-control/too much time on their hands here? Maybe some of y'all went through this but have since scaled back/outgrown it. Do you wish you could just listen to their music and performances and forget everything else? It sure would be a lot healthier for the mind too since you wouldn't feel as attached to strangers.

Does anyone else feel similar??",77,1

I'm sure you're all sick and tired of me; I'm sick and tired of me too. My apologies for being such a pest. I was given the suggestion to sell things off in a bundle. This is my last shot before I call home and tell my mother what's going on. This will also be my last selling post as an ARMY. I don't want to burden this wonderful place or my fellow Bangtan enthusiasts anymore. I'm hoping this bundle comes out to be a deal to whoever might be interested in it. Most of it are BT21 things and some exhibition items. I'm going to throw in whatever else I can find here. I know I have little pocketbooks with all of the BT21 characters somewhere (I won't include that in the price). I have stickers too; little things, just to make it hopefully more worth it for you. As another thank you gift I can draw you something (digitally). I'm not terribly skilled at people, more so animals, but I can give it a shot for your kindness.  
  
It's a big bundle hence the price. If I can sell it in one go, that would be wonderful, but if I need to I can split it. I'll have two prices; Airmail Shipping (1-2 weeks) and Surface Mail Shipping (1-2 Months). Some countries do not qualify for Surface Mail, so we'll have to figure that out before we continue. The price in parentheses is the price with Airmail. 
  
BT21:  
-Tata Standing Doll (55)  
-Cooky Standing Doll (55)  
-Cooky Lying Down Plushie  (40)  
-Chimmy Lying Down Plushie  (40)  
-Mang Face Cushion w/ Bag (Smallest size I believe) (55)  
-Koya Bag Charm (Fullbody) (25)  
-Chimmy and Cooky Christmas Socks (25)  
-Character Notebooks (Large Size) (30)  
-Character Files (The art is super cute) (25)

-Jimin's Exhibition Poster ($30)  
-Exhibition Stationary Set ($20)  
  
Price with Airmail Shipping: $530    
Price with Surface Shipping: $485  

That's pretty much everything I've purchased for myself here save for a few things that I'm clinging on to (my ARMY Bomb which I will die with). As much as it pains me to let it go, my back's against the wall.  
  
I know it's a lot of stuff. :(  
If you have friends or family that would maybe be interested in splitting with you that'd be great. I know it's a hodgepodge or randomness, my apologies. I'm sorry about this whole thing in general. I promise I'll take a break from the subreddit and leave you all in peace. I feel like such a burden, but it's been hard going to school and having this looming shadow over my shoulders. It's even worse at night when my mother calls. My heart is literally in pieces because she has absolutely no idea. I know she'd help me, but she's not in the best situation either and I'd rather do everything in my power to avoid asking her. She's supported me so much abroad. I'd rather sell my soul than ask for more; I wouldn't be able to live with myself.  
  
Sorry for rambling. I feel like an idiot.  
Sending you all warm wishes. I truly hope everyone is doing well. ",10,1

From what I can see they are very close with each other, but what about a few years ago?? Or even before they debuted?? Are there any members that just couldnt get along with the other? Or are there members that frequently pick a fight with other members?",30,1

# GAME RULES

* As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.
* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.
* Choose wisely! **Your vote is final** and cannot be changed.
* I will post a new poll every **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Sunday**. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted. I try to post around **8 AM - 10 AM PST**. Sometimes it may take longer if I need to download and analyze the data when the vote is close or seems odd, or if my personal life intrudes.
* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""** and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

He's really knowledgeable about punk and the way he speaks so passionately about it being a voice for disenfranchised youth and a tool of self-determination actually really reminds of BTS. From that alone I can see how - even though they're coming from completely different musical spheres - their ethos is really in sync. 

With that in mind, I was wondering do any of you listen to any bands/artists that don't necessarily *sound* like BTS, but remind you of them in how they approach their work or the message they want to convey in their work?

-----------



I hold absolutely no grudges against individual Japanese, but Id like to point out one thing. It is Japans national drive to justify the rearmament, while having no historical awareness as a war criminal nation that has caused fatal damage and suffering throughout Asia and just reiterating the empty words of ""forget the past and see the future"", that has caused all these problems today. For this reason, the present generation of Japan, which has not had the chance to study history properly, has no awareness of past history even by one in 10,000 of Germans who are the same war criminals. Will the empty peace brought by such poor historical perceptions really guarantee the real peace of the future? 

One of the major reasons for this unsolved past history is the unscrupulous negotiations made by the South Korean government with Japanese government. However, 70 years after the liberation, the Japanese government still deliberately avoids to acknowledge their past invasion and is continuing to justify the invasion through ""falsification in history textbooks"" and ""self-defense rearmament"". The Japanese government's justification for the past is leaning in great part on the recognition that they are VICTIMS of the atomic bomb.



 ""We are the victims since we got so much damages. The cognitive gap between the Koreans, who think of the atomic bombing as an end of the invasive war that never ends, and the Japanese, who thinks themselves also as victims of war, are that irreconcilably big. 


https://mobile.twitter.com/ohaunoaulait/status/1060607308143583233





And I bet most of Korean would agree with this. 



For those who think the shirt Jimin wore was tasteless or somewhat problematic, I want to say that there were many Korean victims by the bomb as well and most of Korean are aware of this fact. And because they are aware of it, Korean can say they are simply using the bomb pic as a factor which liberate Korea from Japan not as mocekry towards victims. The fact that the grandson of Korea(Chosun) King's family was involved in the victims of the bomb even more strongly indicates Korean's not used the pic for mockery towards victims of the bombs and they have no reasons for them to do so either.

When I looked up reviews I saw several negative ones but they were all from last year or two years ago- none from 2018. 

Has anyone ordered anything recently or had experience? (Both good or bad) I'll be ordering from the English side of the site since I'm located in the U.S.   


My main questions for those who have experience are:   
How long did it take to ship?   
How long until it was delivered from time of shipment?   
Was it well packaged?   
Were you missing any items? And if so how did their customer service respond?

Basically I want a small space where we can just talk about our feelings and concerns and want we want from this. A lot of this discussion has like happened outside with us basically trying to stand firm in face of being dragged into politics.

And we havent really just been able to... TALK. Without a sense of being so careful with our words because we afraid of judgement or making this worse.

Obviously, we are in a rather hard place as a fandom right now. Violent right wingers are at our door, some legit criticisms are being leveraged, caught in a political strife a lot of us are unprepared for and would rather be absent in. There is just nothing but news, even if our sales are amazing the sense of unease is still there.  Probably the thing that is affecting me most is the lack of... any response from BTS side and I mean ANY response. I didnt realise until now how of my place as a stan was based on one sided communication with idols that hasnt said in days. I dont stan Bighit or BTS sales and while I feel proud of all the good they have accomplished, I still became a stan after hours of watching giggling Jimin videos. It currently feels like Im surrounded by news of BTS with zero actual presence of BTS and I know I cant be the only one.

So hopefully... a space to let your hair down on the issue. Cause god knows I need one right now. Dont really have many places to do this considering the nature of it.

So how about you guys?",0,1

361,2018-11-9,2018,11,9,23,9vkpzp,"I am Japanese, and I want to assist in showing the multiple Japanese perspectives regarding the situation with your help.",Nimted,1541772637,"What questions do you have about J-Army, the general Japanese public, and other groups with regards to the recent situation? I want to provide evidence-based, truthful replies about any questions or concerns you had. I saw the clear lack of information on what is happening in the Japanese community, and wanted to put some of that information here in English text.  

Below, I will outline each Japanese group involved with the situation in some way and what I gathered as their point of view. First, J-Army.  
  

The most prominent online community of J-Army is Twitter, and the demographic is mostly middle school and high school girls. Their age most likely explains this, but their general attitudes are either fully supportive for BTS while completely disregarding the situation at hand, or overly emotional support that is being cherrypicked by certain Japanese people to paint a false image of J-Army as a whole.  

Starting with the former, they are things like the hashtag #BTS (#I forever support BTS activities in Japan) and sentiments like Although Im sad that the Music Station performance is cancelled, I will continue to support BTS. Please do not hate Japan after this ([Example](https://twitter.com/s9xus2znoaj5832/status/1060863415504199681?s=21)). Most J-Army are supportive towards BTS. That being said, barely any J-Army belonging to this category discuss or mention the T-shirt, atomic bomb, history, politics, or their opinions.  

The latter group is more of an issue. They touch upon the T-shirt, atomic bomb, history, etc, but down play it in a way that can come off as ignorant and insensitive. These are the tweets that are often being cited by Japanese people criticizing Jimin and BTS. Here is an [example](https://twitter.com/once44477852/status/1060556535519051776?s=21) that says, Is the BTS T-shirt controversy something to be that mad about? Its stupid that theyre whining even though they arent the actual atomic bomb victims. Basically, the its just a T-shirt with mushroom clouds of an atomic bomb is angering the general public Japanese people (in quotations because they are the people expressing their opinions online that are neither J-Army or extreme right-wing nationalists).

  

So what exactly is the general public view of atomic bombs in Japan? It is that they should never be used against anyone ever again, and that many innocent lives were lost. As you can see, the Japanese general public often view it separately from the context of WWII. Im afraid that I wont be able to explain this coherently enough, but I think ends dont justify the means and we, the people of the present, did not take part in WWII sum up the views. To them, any imagery of the atomic bomb in a context other than a reminder of what had happened to the people hit by it are inappropriate. Its not because it signified the loss of Japan in WWII. I think Japanese people are detached to history in general, and its most likely because of the school curriculum (I can expand on this if needed). Again, this is for the general public.  

The above would be the general reason why Jimin and BTS would be criticized by regular Japanese citizens, and most likely the reason why (at least the reason up-front) for the Music Station performance cancellation. The ones who want an apology believe the shirt disrespects atomic bomb victims. 

I of course believe that historical contextualization is important. There was a reason why the bombs were dropped, and what the Japanese did to other countries/territories during wartime cant be forgotten or suspended with an imaginary pin perpetually. However, I also think these things can almost never be completely binary. Thats why I do understand and sympathize with the sentiments about the atomic bomb. Yes it may have been inevitable, but the truth of lives being lost and the damage done was there too. I certainly dont want any more atomic bombs to be dropped anywhere.  

  

The last group is the one I am lacking the most information on, as I am not the strongest in Japanese politics. The right-wing nationalists and xenophobes. I personally think that they are constantly looking for any excuse to expand events, controversies, and information to benefit their political agenda or feed into xenophobia. Its unfortunately also true that there are a good number of people who can associate themselves with this group.  They are the ones who want to turn this into an anti-Korea, Korea vs Japan type of conflict.  An [example tweet](https://twitter.com/kazuyahkd2/status/1060553361227886592?s=21) says, The BTS Music Station performance was apparently cancelled after the atomic bomb T-shirt deal. The fact that they decided on it after consultation must mean that wearing it *was* intentional. Koreas stuck on anti-Japanese sentiments and there is a high chance that they cant issue an apology for the sake of the Korean public opinion, so its over. But they deserved it.  

 

Again, these are the points of view that I gathered from reading through tweets and doing my own research. There definitely are J-Armys explaining the Korean point of view about history, the shirt, and the symbolism behind the atomic bomb but it is sparse.  And on the other hand, there is false information circulating everywhere (English, Japanese, etc.). 

Please feel free to comment on your thoughts, questions, needed clarifications, etc. I hope we all can have a respectful conversation and that the world will be peaceful and free from hate.",310,1

It upvoted fast because the boards are fire about recent controversial and filled with people from (the father of ilbe),(ilbe), (anti-Korea Koreans are in there), and they spreaded it their own gallery. 


While the post spreaded, they added pictures of Nazis and BTS together to make more hate to BTS.


 FYI, the pic of BTS is from Seotaejis concert and they are relating the costumes which Seotaeji had used a decade ago and the flag related Seotaeji to Nazis.

I can only tell that most of them are not positive so I made this discussion just to let it out for the sake of my mental health and stability because I feel supressing what I am feeling doesn't help. I never expected BTS to get stuck in such a huge and complicated situation and everyone reaction to it isn't really helping. I just feel like everyone is approaching this whole situation in such a one sided way and it is just making me more frustrated.  I just felt so trapped and then I realised that it's not even my problem directly and I am feeling this upset so how miserable must BTS be feeling about all this went they are so directly involved? 

How the year has been going so well for them in terms of success and records but they still can't simply enjoy it without being put into controversies after controversies. What a difficult position they must be in, they are this successful but even in this success they can't enjoy it in happiness. Even when the members parents went to see their show in Europe, they still couldn't show themselves at their best, it must have hurt them too. This year despite all that they have achieved is one of their most difficult times in their lives. I wonder how Jimin is coping through all this, he is in many way the most sensitive member of BTS and is now in such a difficult situation. I hope the boys got to talk to their family and be with them to help them through this. I just hope we and the boys just survive this, just live through this, that's all. Nothing more and nothing less. Let's just play everything goes, move on or whatever helps you , remember that every time is meant to pass whether good or bad, this too will soon pass and become a thing of the past.


**Disclaimer**- please refrain from addressing the controversy, it has already been addressed in multiple discussion thread both here and in r/kpop and I don't think we can add anything new to all that has been discussed.

 Think of this post as a way to release all that you are feeling, just to let it out so that you can view the things and situation without being clouded by negative feelings. Just a place to release it and start again with a better outlook. The outlook being that this situation too will pass soon, just like it was said in everything goes, whether it be happy times or sad times it too will pass. Never expected it but Everything goes somehow helps so much, at least to me it helped.",15,1

This is the right-wing and Japanese govt playing politics. Doing this takes the worlds focus off of their wrongdoings in the past.

I love Japan but the govt and right-wing always pull this crap when discussions of war crimes and WWII come up. If you go on twitter, if you go on any social media do not argue. Instead do the one thing that the Govt is terrified of, bring up the truth. Bring up the court ruling, bring up the history. 

This is not to hurt J-army. Love and respect them, this is a way to get the Govt' of Japan and the right-wing fueling this to stand down. They will drop this if they see people not talking about the shirt but talking about the past. They don't want the world to focus on that they've done and did an incredible job of the decades to get the majority of the world to forget what their crimes. This isn't to trivialize the pain and suffering Japan went through when the bombs dropped, but that isn't a free pass.

Show them that they've done the opposite of their goal and the media in Japan will stop posting these clickbait controversies to distract.

We've been incredibly reactionary and have forgotten our true power as Army. We are legion, we are far more powerful than we realize. We've done incredible things in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Don't let this deter you. Don't let this distract you.

Again, this is not an attack on J-army. They've been incredible through this. What this is is a way to let those in Japan pushing this crap know that their distractions aren't working. 

So don't go to r/kpop, or any forums. Instead go on social media and engage in truth telling. Bring up the court case, bring up the comfort women. Bring up the kidnappings and slave labor. Bring up the lack of education in Japan on their history. Bring up the harassment of Koreans in Japan, if you see posts by known right-wingers bring up who they are and that you know who they are. Subtweet Abe and the Japanese govt. Always be polite and respectful when you do this, wrangle the younger armies. Create nicely worded responses to the younger armies out there.

I'm not saying that Jimin shouldn't have been more careful, but let's not allow the Japanese govt and other bad actors use BTS for their political agendas. ",148,1
387,2018-11-10,2018,11,10,12,9vrc4i,Another Korean's Perspective on the T-Shirt 'Controversy',calicocatbae,1541822351,"Hey guys, I know that this might be a bit late (and repetitive) to bring up the issue again, but I had a chance to talk to my mom (born &amp; raised in Korea) today about it and she said some interesting things that I wanted to share. I'm also Korean, but I moved to the US when I was young.

There's a lot of ideas floating around. Some people say that the atomic bomb is a symbol for liberation in Korea, some say that it's a symbol of destruction and war in Japan, others say that regardless of what it symbolizes, it's a very painful event in world history and that a UN and UNICEF ambassador shouldn't wear something like that, especially on broadcast.

When I told my mom about it, she said that it just sounds like the internet is blowing this up again. According to her, the atomic bomb isn't much of a symbol at all in Korea - it's just a historical event. It does symbolize the end of WWII, but in a historical way, not in a nationalistic way. She interpreted the shirt as a 'this is a historical event that happened that Korea was involved in' and 'let's celebrate our liberation &amp; the end of WWII and also acknowledge the historical events behind it, including the atomic bomb'. I believe that the designer of the shirt intended the same thing, as he put out a statement that he did not intend for the shirt to be interpreted as 'the atomic bomb was a great thing'. I haven't seen this idea much, so I thought I'd share it.

I think it's slightly annoying that people in r/kpop and K-pop Twitter who are not Korean or Japanese are interpreting this as a horrible thing. They are looking at this controversy from a Western perspective, not a Korean/Japanese perspective. I think that the way we are taught history in the respective education systems of America/Europe, Korea, and Japan influenced the way people are interpreting this.

Okay, that's it. I just wanted to let y'all know another perspective. What do you think about this idea?",3,1

We just wanted to share the latest from our most recent campaign AND we got a few report updates to share from Thirst Relief campaign in July and the AnpanARMY projects during the LY Tour!

&amp;#x200B;

First, this month's campaign is for the benefit of people in Venezuela, who are dealing with a mass national issue of hyperinflation and poverty. We partnered with an organization called \*\*Cuatro Por Venezuela\*\* which was founded by four Venezuelan women who emigrated to the US and are doing what they can to provide aid, food, medical care &amp; supplies, &amp; education support for the people in Venezuela. Info on the campaign is here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1057648771478290432](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1057648771478290432)  This month's activity is called ""Van To The Future"" which is an interactive game following a storyline of BT21's Van and involving finding BTS photos that would match up to various items in Venezuela. Game storyline here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1057981953507504133?s=19](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1057981953507504133?s=19)

&amp;#x200B;

Okieees updates! The \*\*AnpanARMYxLYTour Project.\*\* Here's a report thread about it with photos and such: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1056626515755057152](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1056626515755057152) (the top photo was taken from my seat during the citifield concert, it was amazing!) This project involved arranging for all the tour stops to also be places where ARMYs could participate in projects as a thank-you to the cities for hosting the boys and us. The first few cities in the US, due to limited time and volunteers, we weren't able to arrange much but we had time and good resources to get something going for Citifield, and the ball kept rolling from there through the European leg of the tour. ARMYs brought cans and blankets to the concert to be donated to food pantries and shelters via City Harvest, brought thank you notes to the staff (they were given to Citifield staff, Big Hit staff, and even security and NYPD), and even did some cleaning up, though most of the venues prohibited that as an arranged activity so it was left to people to clean up after themselves, which a good many did. In Europe, ARMYs donated to FareShareUK for hunger prevention and food waste, supported the #FlowWithJimin campaign on Jimin's birthday, brought nonperishable food and toiletries for Secours Populaires (FR) and the thank you notes were given out. Guys. The staff were so surprised about the notes, some of them actually cried.

&amp;#x200B;

Support the support staff. They work hard. Thank you for listening to my TED Talk.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, final two updates! I don't think we ever shared the September report from \*\*#RebuiltWithNamjoon\*\* with Gili Eco Trust, so I'll just drop that here [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1051174597842952192](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1051174597842952192) (cool thing to note, the people at Gili wrote a letter to BTS thanking them for inspiring ARMY to help them, and they invited the boys to come visit - the Gili islands are an eco-tourism destination - to see for themselves what ARMY did in BTS' name. It's the longest shot ever but we really hope they take them up on that offer and go visit! BV4?!), and we got some AWESOME report cards back from our July campaign with photos and stories of the people in Tanzania who received the water filters from ARMY! (I'm linking to the second batch, but there's a link to the first one in it). [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1060551461254381569](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1060551461254381569) Soon we are going to have the report back from MindLeaps from the \*\*#FlowWithJimin\*\* campaign in October and you will NOT want to miss that one. We'll put it in the weekly room as soon as the final info comes in!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the constant support guys, sharing the campaigns, spreading it, donating, etc.! We're aiming as ARMY to follow BTS' example and use our famdom power to do something good in this world. We're aiming to prove that ""Next Generation Leaders"" isn't just a random title put on BTS, it's something they truly deserve because they really do lead and inspire others, and because of them, ARMY makes a real impact on the lives of people in this world who could use a little help from others.

[source](https://lite-ra.com/i/2018/11/post-4362-entry.html)

BTS was supposed to appear on TV Asahi's Music Station (M Sute) today, but their appearance was suspended on short notice. On November 8, the night before the broadcast, TV Asahi announced on the program homepage that BTS' appearance was cancelled.

*The November 9th appearance of BTS (first announced on November 2nd) has been suspended. We received reports that the design of a T-shirt a member previously wore is currently creating a stir. The program consulted with their affiliated record label to question the intentions behind wearing it. As a result, a comprehensive decision with the aforementioned company was made to, unfortunately, suspend their appearance at this time. We apologise to the viewers who were looking forward to their appearance.*

The ""design of a T-shirt a member previously wore"" mentioned here is in reference to a T-shirt worn by member Jimin, printed with the photo of a mushroom cloud from an atomic bomb and currently the focus of discussion on the internet for being highly problematic.

In other words, TV Asahi cited the reason for BTS' program suspension to be ""the design of a T-shirt a member wore,"" and shut them out from the program.

No matter how you think about it, this is strange. The problematic T-shirt in question was worn by Jimin during their world tour in 2017. And it wasn't worn on stage, but in a behind-the-scene shot. It wasn't a recent development either, having already made its rounds through ARMY (the name of BTS fans) discussion, and was considered a thing of the past. Furthermore, online right-wingers have taken to calling it by the inflammatory name, the ""A-bomb T-shirt"" when in reality, the ""A-bomb"" was not the main focus. The main focus was ""[National Liberation Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Day_of_Korea)"" (August 15, the day when Korea was freed from Japanese occupation).

The main design of the T-shirt in question was the printed words PATRIOTISM OURHISTORY LIBERATION KOREA, which had one photo of the Nagasaki mushroom cloud and one photo of people celebrating their liberation, each printed at a small size.

The T-shirt designer, CEO Kwang Jae of LJ Company stated ""I had no intention of mocking Japan. It was a representation of history and how Korea was liberated as a result of Japan's unconditional surrender from the atomic bomb being dropped,"" explaining that he had no intention of inciting anti-Japanese sentiments (from news site Wow!Korea, November 9 2018). Indeed, it is clear from the design that the T-shirt's main focus is the liberation of the Korean peninsula.

From the perspective of the Koreans that suffered under the colonial rule of the Japanese during the war, the atomic bomb symbolised the end of the war.

Of course, that doesn't mean a design that looks back on the tragedy of the atomic bomb and all the innocent deaths with approval should be endorsed by any means. However, as stated before, Jimin wore the T-shirt a long time ago and hasn't been sighted wearing it since the issue came to light.

So why is this topic heating up again now?

The answer to that lies in the online right-wingers and their use of BTS as a tool to fan the flames of their ""anti-Korea"" and ""Korean hate"" agenda.

&amp;nbsp;

**Sakurai Makoto, former President of the Zaitokukai, incited online right-wingers to attack M Sute through phone calls**

To raise an example, former [Zaitokukai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaitokukai) president [Sakurai Makoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Sakurai) updated [his blog](https://ameblo.jp/doronpa01/entry-12416625243.html) on November 5 and announced his intention to ""spam call"" Music Station's sponsor companies. Furthermore, the post was worded in a way that encouraged similar protest behaviour from readers:

*Sakurai personally wants to question these companies the following in regards to the TV Asahi broadcast on November 9: ""Are you aware that the Korean group slated to appear on your show wore an A-bomb T-shirt that celebrated the atomic bomb drop on Japan?"" ""Is it right to let Koreans appear on the program amidst worsening public opinion of Japan-Korea relations, and with the recently revoked [Treaty on Basic Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Basic_Relations_between_Japan_and_the_Republic_of_Korea)?"" ""Is your company anti-Japanese?"" These questions should concern not only Sakurai but all of Japan as a whole. If you are Japanese, you should love your country. This has nothing to do with left-right ideologies.*

Mr Sakurai wrote these words as though he was expressing anger towards the A-bomb T-shirt, but considering how Mr Sakurai himself has trampled on the hearts of atomic bomb victims before, his words are questionable at best.

Previously, the Zaitokukai has protested for the demolition of the [Genbaku Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial) and held demonstrations in support of nuclear arming Japan on August 6. If the issue at hand was really about the A-bomb or nuclear weapons, then instead of questioning the print of a photo on a T-shirt Jimin wore, shouldn't we be questioning Mr Sakurai himself?

In other words, the A-bomb T-shirt is just an excuse dug out to use in an attack against BTS, and the truth behind the BTS-bashing is no more than an agenda for Korea-hate. This means BTS themselves are simply being used as a tool to criticise Korea.

If you're a person who is even a little bit aware of the current state of pop music, you would have heard of the monumental achievements BTS has made as an Asian group.

BTS sent two consecutive albums to 1st place on the American Billboard Charts with LOVE YOURSELF Tear (released May this year) and LOVE YOURSELF Answer (released August this year). They have undeniably become a globally recognised boyband.

Of course, this is the first time for a group from Asia to achieve such results on the main chart. But what makes BTS' achievement even more impressive is the fact their albums have been completely sung in Korean. The last time an album sung in a language other than English topped the chart was Il Divo's *Encore* 12 years ago.

And BTS' activities for this year don't stop there. On September 24, they attended Generation Unlimited, a partnership that aims to ensure that every young person is in education, learning, training or employment, and gave a speech at the United Nations headquarters in New York.

It is possible that BTS has been treated with animosity out of envy for achieving levels of success that Japanese musicians could never acquire until now.

**TV Asahi caved to the discriminatory protests of online right-wingers as anti-Korean sentiments rose after the forced labour court decision**

On top of this, racists like Mr Sakurai are clearly aiming to fan the flames of Korean hatred as Japan-Korea relations worsen due to the [forced labour court decision](http://time.com/5438709/korea-japan-court-forced-labor-compensation/).

TV Asahi's M Sute can only be called short-sighted for caving, exactly as planned, to the discriminatory demands of the online right-wingers.

Furthermore, there have been claims after the suspension of their M Sute appearance that ""Their [Kouhaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen) is gone now too,"" but how long this suzerain state determination (/[probably a metaphor](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suzerain)) will last is almost laughable. While it is believed that BTS' attendance at Kouhaku Uta Gassen is almost certainly not happening, as stated earlier, if you consider BTS' current position in the world of pop culture, it is clear they are no longer at a level where the decisions of one Japanese TV program can affect them.

Now, to change the topic a littlethe events that have occurred this time where ""a musician was removed from a music program due to a political issue"" is clearly a case of bringing ""politics"" into ""music"". In present-day Japan, there is an almost decisive movement to ""[keep music out of politics](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/08/07/music/injecting-little-music-japanese-politics/)"" in regards to musicians that criticise the Abe administration, but for some reason, no one spoke up against it this time. How curious.

But that aside, as people who focus on BTS to stir anti-foreign ideologies increase, there is one thing that should be askedis K-POP being used as a tool to incite the division of people?

This applies to not only BTS, but BLACKPINK, EXO, TWICE, NCT 127, Red Velvet, iKON, IZ\*ONE, SEVENTEEN, and LOONA too. Their music encourages the solidarity of their fans, not division.

Many K-POP groups these days are composed of not only Koreans but multiple nationalities. Out of the aforementioned groups, there are even Japanese members in TWICE, IZ\*ONE, and NCT 127. Members from all kinds of backgrounds gather together to form one group, furthering their unity by teaching each other their language and culture. Watching this is another source of enjoyment for the fans too.

&amp;nbsp;

**K-POP is not a tool for dividing people! The youth who promote Japan-Korea cultural exchange through music**

Connecting with each other through culture like pop music is one great way international goodwill is formed.

Mr Furuya Masayuki, Korean pop culture journalist and one of the leading experts in K-POP in Japan, stated the following in a Eureka interview (November 2018 issue) regarding how hostile Japan-Korea relations frequently come to a head on the internet:

""The only thing we can do to close the gap is to focus on steadily building a grassroots network of exchange. There are things you can only start to see once you actually go to Korea and experience some kind of relationship.""

The current situation in Japan has many internet news sites publishing articles focused on creating a bad impression of Korea, but if you try and understand the other side and their culture, you'll be able to form your own opinion of the news sites without being swayed by misconceptions.

""Right now, the number of school students listening to K-POP is increasing dramatically. Those children are able to look at Korea with genuine feelings that haven't been corrupted by the walls adults have created. It is extremely important to connect with foreign countries through the easy opening made by entertainment. By doing that, the other side can be understood better, and as I said before, you can form your own opinions when reading news sites. You can tell yourself ""This may say this, but there are other things to be considered,"" and guide yourself to your own answer. I feel like that is where the future lies.""

In reality, there are many youths out there who started learning Korean because of love for their K-POP idols, as well as many who have culturally connected with Korean fans through Twitter or Instagram.

Between the online right-wingers wailing that ""The A-Bomb Boys should stay out of Japan"" or ""Connections with Korea should be severed"" and the youth cultivating their international awareness through a skilful use of Hangul and SNS, which do you think has the brighter future?

414,2018-11-11,2018,11,11,1,9vvokq,I'm a Korean. I am not good at English. But I want to talk about the Korean perspective on this BTS issue.,Bbiew,1541867906,"This is my first time writing in reddit, I'm not good at English

So let's get the help of a Google translator

I'm sorry to hear that the sentence is strange, but I still want to say something.

&amp;#x200B;

It will be very long. I'm sorry I can not write English well and write long.

It will take a fairly long time to look at several areas.

At the end of the article, I will put the original text in consideration of the translation error.

I wrote the original text to translate machine translation well, but I do not know what will happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First,

Most Koreans do not hate Japanese people.

Many people seem to think that Koreans and Japanese are fighting and hating each other.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, many young people in Japan love Korea very much. But older people are a little different.

Many young people in Korea also like Japan very much.

But as they age to learn history and learn about history related to Japan, they feel it.

&amp;#x200B;

""I like Japan, I did not know that Japan would have done this to us ... But why does Japan not feel sorry for us?""

&amp;#x200B;

I actually have nephews. My second niece and my third niece are very fond of Japanese comics.

When the children were about 14 years old I happened to tell you about the past of Japan and Korea.

The children seemed to be confused. Because they liked Japan.

The fact that these children like Japan does not mean they send blind support to Japan.

They think that Japan is a ""friend country of Korea.""

My nephews love Japan even after they have learned about Japan's mistakes in Korea in the past.

However, in the part where Japan conceals the past and takes a blatant attitude, the children are sick and irritated.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are interested in K-POP, you may know 'Produce 48' which was a while ago.

See how Korean girls and Japanese girls are doing there.

Did Koreans hate Japanese people there? Did the children of Korea pursue history against the children of Japan?

The Korean children, of course, knew the history of Korea and Japan.

The Korean children know the past mistakes of Japan, but the Korean children worked with the Japanese children,

Now it becomes 'IZONE' and moves to one.

&amp;#x200B;

It is not because Koreans hate Japan because they criticize Japan in terms of politics and history.

Koreans probably want to solve the problem with Japan (there will be some people who will not)

Koreans want the Japanese to mourn over what happened in Korea in the past and tell them that Japan will never again.

Koreans already consider Japan to be a friend country.

A friend is a friend, a little shameless ... a friend like a little 'psychopath'.

&amp;#x200B;

If Japan, like Germany, has properly cleared past problems,

Now Korea and Japan are really good friends.

In my daily life, Koreans are rather interested in Japanese people.

(Speaking of a socially healthy Japanese, not a Japanese isolated person on the Internet)

&amp;#x200B;

I think the Japanese who know a little about history think that 'Koreans will hate Japanese'.

It is because they feel that their country is hated even though they think.

Many of the Japanese people who have such a mind want to say ""It is not right for Koreans to hate Japanese people""

I seem to be devoting myself to eliminate the legitimacy of the complaints about Japan's mistakes.

It is very uncomfortable for Koreans. Not only Korea, but East Asia as a whole will be offended.

That's why fighting can only happen.

However, Japan always repeats it to show such behavior.

That's why fighting happens, not because Koreans hate Japanese people.

(There are also people who hate Japan in this process)

This is what Koreans are criticizing. The Japanese Empire of the past, the Japanese government that hides and misses it,

And the attitude of the Japanese people who do not take responsibility for it, and the forces that manipulate it.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, among the Koreans living in Japan,

I heard there are people who ask, ""Do Koreans really hate Japanese people?""

If he hated the Japanese, he would not have become friendly in the first place ... Why would he ask such a silly question?

Koreans just want Japan to acknowledge the mistakes of their history and make sure that they are correct.

The Japanese, knowing that mind and pretending not to know,

Such an attitude is an act that makes friends and even friends go away, and it is an act that can not make friends

&amp;#x200B;

What I have to say is that Koreans do not hate Japanese people emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly,

Korea was a poorer country than Somalia after the Korean War.

Because of that, no one was interested internationally,

We could not communicate any words to the international community.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, Japan experienced a period of stagnation after World War II,

While South Korea was engaged in the Korean War, it was preparing to lay the foundations for growth,

It quickly grew to become a great country that stands out from the rest of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of that, Westerners who did not know the situation of Asia favored the Japanese,

Westerners also accepted Japanese viewpoints about the mistakes of the Japanese Empire.

The voice of Korea has not reached the international community.

Koreans have been buried in Japan without reaching their hearts in the international community.

Koreans were saddened that they could not convey the pain of Korea to the world.

The world was interested in Japan because I was not interested in Korea at all.

&amp;#x200B;

'Korea is emotionally dislike Japanese because of past problems. Koreans hate it all the time. '

As a Korean, living in Korea everyday and facing Koreans,

I feel that this idea has already been interpreted in terms of the views Japan has made in the international community.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, the Nazi Haken Creutz and the ""rising sun flag"" of the Japanese Empire.

&amp;#x200B;

Westerners know the symbolism of Nazi Haken Creutzs.

So when you see it, you are very angry, and if you see people who are proud of it, you can not stand anger.

But in the Orient, the rising sun flag was their symbol for the Japanese Empire at the time,

Of course in the Orient it is very angry.

&amp;#x200B;

Westerners, however, try to get rid of it by protesting Hanken Kreitz,

Unlike that, there is not much interest in 'rising sun flag'.

Even in the latest Western games, 'rising sun flag' is used as a cool design,

Indeed, westerners call it ""a thing of the past, it's a great design.""

Why is there such a difference? It is because the West has already adapted to the rising sun flag during the period of Japan's influence.

However, the West does not understand the Orient 's position and says, ""It' s time for peace, let 's just get along.""

Can you stay in touch with Haken Creutz? What about the victims of that symbol?

It is the same. Why does the Western community have no objections to Western and Japanese content creators and designers who use the ""rising sun flag""?

Why do you treat them as 'feelings of Asians who did not forget the past'?

&amp;#x200B;

To understand the minds of Koreans, imagine a situation where many people in your city decorate Haken Creutz in front of your home.

And to you embarrassed to it, someone asian

Imagine saying, ""You live in the past, look for the future and peace.""

Please consider the hearts of Koreans and Asians about these issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that people of the world have never been interested in Japan's past that was the Nazi brothers until now.

I thank BTS for making it so interesting for so many people around the world.

I am not grateful for wearing that T-shirt. People around the world

I thank them just for giving me a chance to look into the pain of Korea.

This is the power of culture. Just as Japan, once dominant in its culture around the world, made the world favorable to Japan.

At that time, Korea could not say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Where was the Japanese Empire in the past,

What does it mean to Koreans that the land of the Japanese Empire was hit with a big blow by the atom bomb?

For Americans to understand these feelings a little more closely,

Imagine when Osama bin Laden, the 911 terrorist leader, was killed after a long pursuit.

Koreans are not suffering from some soldiers in Japan. Koreans suffered from the entire system created by the Japanese Empire.

Koreans also suffered from ordinary Japanese civilians.

The atomic bombing is a symbol of the collapse of all the systems, not the excitement of the victims of the atomic bomb in the city.

Perhaps the thoughts of all Koreans are not the same as me,

The damage done by Koreans and the feelings of Koreans are not so flat and simple.

&amp;#x200B;

Koreans also refer to this as 'punished'.

But when you say that, their minds are not exactly

It is not 'the Japanese of the place was punished,' but 'the system that performed the devilish acts was punished.'

General Koreans are not happy or excited that Japanese civilians are dying in large numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a child, on a bulletin board on the Internet, I had a conversation with a Japanese who had no idea, and I had seen a Japanese map of the sea.

Have you ever seen an undersea map of Japan? The mainland of Japan suddenly leads to the deep sea from the east.

I was so amazed that I asked the Japanese anxiously.

""There is a lot of earthquakes in Japan, is not it dangerous?""

The Japanese thought I mocked my country and the people who live there.

During the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Korean government also donated money, and Korean celebrities also donated money.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think about this, you can say, ""But there were innocent civilians there! Do not forget your regrets!""

That's right.

What I want to say is that it is too much distortion for Koreans to say that they are delighted that the Japanese are dead.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for these stories is that while the international community is fond of Japan

The voices of the countries affected by Japan have not reached the international community.

I wanted to tell you that there is an awareness of the international community that has been made from the viewpoint of Japanese people for many years.

So, I think there are many things that I would like to understand from the point of view of Japan in recognizing Korea.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly,

You already know about the sexual slavery kidnapping in Japan.

It is because countries including Korea have announced for a long time.

Some of you may know about 731 units. I have a wiki page in English.

&amp;#x200B;

But I do not think there are many people who know exactly what experiments happened in it.

I do not think there is anyone who knows how the people who committed the anti-human crimes lived in Japan after the war.

For reference, this unit was established before the outbreak of World War II.

This was established before the outbreak of the war, and I think it means a Japanese research facility operated for Japanese military research purposes, not for war.

It was not a research facility established for war, but a human biology laboratory using civilian civilians regardless of war.

&amp;#x200B;

Among the mistakes Japan has made are many things that are not well communicated to the West,

I would like to explain the details of the 731 unit in detail and understand the point of view that can only blame the Japanese government in Asia.

Koreans grow up as they learn about history when they are young.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731)

This is the wiki page for 731 units in Japan.

However, there is only superficial content and details of what experiments were done.

I would like to tell you more about these experiments.

And I hope that it will be a chance to understand more Koreans' minds.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyed0dpdAZg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyed0dpdAZg)

This is a video related to the 731 unit in Youtube.

There may be people already familiar with this.

But how those who ordered this experiment lived,

There are many who do not know how this unit succeeded. So let me tell you.

&amp;#x200B;

For an overview of 731 units, see the wiki page above.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

731 Unit Biological Experiment Details (731 units caught by Soviet troops are known in Khabarovsk trial)

&amp;#x200B;

Bioreactor experiment

\- Removed organs to see how the disease affects the body. The corruption process was carried out in a living state because it affects the outcome.

\- Adult male, adult female, child, infant were all eligible. However, according to testimony, the age was in the 20s \~ 40s.

\- Biopsy experiments were also performed on pregnant women.

\- Sometimes, the fetus is taken by a doctor and the fetus is taken out.

\- The arm or leg of the prisoner was cut to study bleeding.

**- The severed arm or leg was often stuck on the opposite side of the prisoner.**

\- Some prisoners' arms or legs were frozen and severed.

\- Sometimes frozen and melted to study the effects of untreated gangrene and corruption.

\- Some prisoners were surgically resected and connected with esophagus and intestines.

\- Some of the brain, lungs and liver have been removed from some prisoners.

**- The subject's skin was stripped from the living condition to obtain a skin specimen.**

\- Consciousness is alive and semi-corpse **maruta** was incinerated.

**- The male and female genitalia were cut and transplanted into the local part of each other.**

\* '**maruta**'**(****)** means 'log' in Japanese. 731 It means that the members of the unit considered the human being as a log.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapon experiment

\- To test the grenades, human targets were placed at different locations on various distances.

\- Flamethrowers were tested on humans.

\- Man was tied to a pile to test bacterial release bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs.

**- Nigo research (**[**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese\_nuclear\_weapon\_program**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_nuclear_weapon_program)**,** [**http://kh16549.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-172.html**](http://kh16549.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-172.html)**).**

**This was a nuclear test that was enough to overpower US nuclear weapons. He even said he had carried out atmospheric nuclear tests off the coast of Hamhung.**

**Human experiments were mass mobilized.**

&amp;#x200B;

Bacterial experiment

\- Detectors have been infected with disease-causing bacteria and studied their effects. It was disguised as a vaccination.

\- To investigate the effects of untreated sexually transmitted diseases, male and female detainees were sexually infected with syphilis and gonorrhea.

\- Disease propagation To obtain fleas in large quantities, prisoners were infected with fleas and the effectiveness of bacterial defense was studied.

**- Some prisoners were fed with disease-causing bacteria in dumplings to measure the rate at which they spread. No one doubted this because the food that was given to the prisoners at that time was buns.**

\- Infectious fleas, infected clothing and supplies were packed in bombs and dropped into various targets. At this time, pottery bombs developed mainly by Ishii Shiro were used mainly, but pottery bombs weakened the explosive power deliberately to minimize the death of the germs inside. It is estimated that about 400,000 people have died from infectious diseases such as fest, cholera, and anthrax. Ironically, however, there were many deaths from 731 units in the process of multiplying germs.

&amp;#x200B;

Other bio experiment

\- Some prisoners stuck to their neck to find out how long it took to be choked to death.

**- Some prisoners were injected with air into the arteries or heart to determine the time of embolization.**

\- Some prisoners were injected with horse urine in their kidneys.

\- Some prisoners did not give any water or food to determine the time taken to die.

\- Some prisoners were placed in a high pressure room until they died.

**- Some prisoners were placed at a very low temperature and frostbite. To survive in such conditions, it was to know how corpulence and the gangrene of the human body were produced. This was done mainly for female prisoners.**

\- Some experiments were to know the relationship between temperature, burn, and human survival.

\- The blood of animals was injected into some recipients and their effects were studied.

\- Some prisoners were put into the gas chambers to test various kinds of chemical weapons. In relation to this, **all the survivors of 731 units closed their mouths. However, the survivors of the 516 units who had been working in the mission began to testify.**

\- Seawater was injected into some prisoners. It was to see if the sea water could replace the saline solution. For reference, it is common to argue that poet Yoon Dong-ju and Song Mong-gyu were killed by this experiment.

\- Some prisoners were subjected to vacuum experiments. It was an experiment of how much a person could hold in a vacuum.

**- In order to do maternity test, the mother and her mother cloaked the child in a small space and filled the water. The mother first raised her child, but later she put the child on the floor and tried to survive.**

&amp;#x200B;

In order to establish the army of soldiers in the 731 unit, the soldiers forced them to bat with the weakest or most rebellious prisoners before using them as experimental materials.

This is a measure to prevent Japanese soldiers, who perceive prisoners as human beings, from escaping prisoners and demanding release, while preventing them from betraying the organization by planting consciousness.

\* The people of the experiment are called logs, so they do not make soldiers feel like humans.

&amp;#x200B;

The rough description of what 731 units were studying is over.

There may be errors in details. Just understand what it was like.

The Japanese government has consistently denied it to 731 units.

However, on October 16, 2011, when the secret document on the 731 unit was found and the contents were too detailed to be denied

In August 2002, the Tokyo District Court first recognized the presence of 731 units and some of the crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let me tell you what happened to the leaders of the unit after the war.

&amp;#x200B;

The officers of the unit returned to Japan and settled in the Japanese medical profession, establishing a company called 'Japanese Green Cross()'

Become a senior citizen in Japan. However, from the very beginning, many of the forms of anti-humanism in clinical trials have been done whether nature can not be deceived.

The company was merged into a company called 'Yoshitomi Pharmaceuticals' in the form of mergers and acquisitions in 1998 and became a company called 'Welfide Corporation'

And through the process of merging with another company ... (Learn more here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi\_Tanabe\_Pharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Tanabe_Pharma))

Finally, it becomes 'Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation'.

The address of the site is [https://www.mt-pharma.co.jp/e/](https://www.mt-pharma.co.jp/e/)

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine a situation where Auschwitz executives later set up a company and run a pharmaceutical company in Germany.

Japan is doing that. The company denies that there is no relationship,

There are medicines manufactured from 'Japanese Green Cross()' with manufacturing technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Jiro Ishii ( ), commander of the 731 unit

In February 1960, discovered at the Kyoto University Medical Library in January 2014, a name was found in a doctoral dissertation on the subject of cholera research

After the war, it was revealed that the result of the anti-human behavior of 731 units was continuously applied to academia while being treated as an elder of the medical community.

&amp;#x200B;

And look at this picture. This is a photo of Japanese Prime Minister on May 12, 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yq9v0lw94jx11.jpg

    Photo description: [On May 12, 2013, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the Air Self-Defense Force Higashi Matsushima Base
    A lot of the T-4 trainer of the blue impulse acrobatics team got on board the 731 and took a memorial picture.
    Obviously provocative acts, whether accidentally or intentionally. Crucially, this is a huge burden for the United States, the largest ally of Japan,
    This is because we want to avoid the issue of 731 more troops from the US who pardoned the troops of the 731 troops in exchange for the data.
    Even in the United States, which spoke extensively about the 731 unit, it responded that there were no words.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is only about the 731 units that Japan did.

Japan's many details in East Asia are not well known in the international community.

I do not know everything.

&amp;#x200B;

It is the body of the third paragraph from now on.

Nevertheless, now Koreans do not hate Japanese.

Typical Koreans have a favor with the Japanese.

Koreans think Japanese as neighbors without bad thoughts.

But Japan continues to provoke it politically and says South Korea threatens Japan.

And Westerners say to East Asians:

""Stay in peace, it's the age of peace.""

&amp;#x200B;

In the event of an East Asian nuclear accident, Koreans donated a lot of money to Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, the damage caused by radiation has come directly to Korea,

Also, because Japan showed such absurd actions as trying to circulate the radioactive product to Korea

Koreans are very annoyed by Japan about these radiation problems,

&amp;#x200B;

A little different story, but the hukusima timber is used for the construction of the building where the athletes will live during the Tokyo Olympics,

Did you hear that hukusima's ingredients will be used in the diet of Olympic athletes?

In my eyes, Japan politically used the Olympics and said, ""Japan is completely devoid of radiation damage,

I think the whole world has accepted the idea of sending players from all over the world. ""

In fact, Japan broadcasts hukusima crops to Japanese entertainers to cover up the damage of radiation,

'Let's eat and cheer'. And celebrities know that they suffer from the aftereffects of exposure.

I think it is so obvious to say that there has been no damage to the nuclear power plant since the Olympics has transformed concealment in the country internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, Koreans still enjoy traveling to Japan.

Even taking radiation damage. (But I do not want to go to the east of Japan because I know how scary the radiation is.)

There are many people who have traveled to Japan around me.

In fact, Koreans are very favorable to Japanese people in personal and personal relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Although there have been such terrible things in history, Korea has only criticized Japan historically,

General Koreans want to be friendly and friendly with Japanese people.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the Japanese Internet is filled with content that mocked and criticized South Korea.

In some Japanese bookstores, there is also a dedicated space for books that mock Korea.

And they all say 'anti japan' to say anything bad about Japan.

Or ""Koreans manipulated Japan to make it look bad.""

&amp;#x200B;

Even Japanese people speak on SNS. ""In Japan, Koreans say they hate Japanese people, but even if they came from Japan because they were traveling in Korea, everyone was kind.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a desire to blame Japan, but it expresses the feelings of Koreans.

What do they want the Korean people to do?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My point of view is not a fight of argument, argument, or political opinion.

It is an expression of my heart, what I want is communication.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all Koreans would agree with me,

What I want to convey is not that Koreans hate Japan when they protest against Japan's past,

Naturally, there is no reason why the BTS is willing to maliciously ridicule the Japanese civilians for their slaughter.

If the Great East Japan Earthquake strikes again, I think the BTS will send a donation. Like so many celebrities in Korea.

* V's ""I'm so afraid"" from The Truth Untold
* V's ""Someday"" from Crystal Snow
* Whatever the heck V sings at the very end of Sea (I'm noticing a pattern here :-P )
* Suga's ""Keeping myself busy"" in Let Go
* J-Hope's "" An ul geol an jjijeul geol..."" line in Outro: Tear. Half of the time I don't even remember the translation, but his delivery, oof!
* Honorary mention to ""Until this cold winter ends...Please stay there a little longer, Please stay there"" from Spring Day. It's not the delivery, cause I don't always remember \*where\* in the song this verse is; just knowing it's in the song at all is what gets to me.",145,1

But honestly, i realised Jimin is always taking pictures and filming everything. (During bon voyage, when they made the BT21 figures, in certain Bangtan bombs like the one where Jin was rapping to Suga's Nevermind)

And when Jimin does it, I just find it soo adorable. I just end up being like: omg look at him. He is filming this like he's a proud mom. He is so cute &gt;o&lt;

I'm finally leaving Korea after a very stressful couple of months. I'm ready to bid goodbye to my 7-11 fueled diet and hopefully find myself in a better situation once home. I'm selling the rest of my things to help me get back. While it'd be nice to sell this stuff as a bundle, I'll take anything at this point; just as long as I can afford some food and transport to the airport because I have about 50 won (5 cents?) and some gum. Thank you to all who have purchased from me in the past. God knows where I would be had it not been for your help. Below are the goods, they are inclusive of airmail prices. If you'd like cheaper shipping, message me! Though I'd highly suggest the mugs not go on the boat, I hear it's a rough trip. I've also added the bundle price in bold. Thank you all again. This trip would have been hell had it not been for everyone's help.

So

RM is about chasing ones dreams and fighting for ones voice to be heard. It matched the period it was released - right around their first win. It was desperate, in a way

Agust D is dark and powerful. They'd fought and won a battle to be thrown before more challenges. It showed the struggles behind their newly acquired fame - what led to it and what they feel now

Hope World has some serious/dark undertones but they're successful and relatively comfortable now. There are still problems and stress and reasons to cry, but like it says in hangsang, they're happy now

Blue Side transitions into Tokyo so well. Mono feels like the quiet after a flurry of activity, the empty auditorium after the audience leaves, or one's dark room after a long day. There's finally time to think and reflect. It may feel lonely and it's easy to drown in those thoughts, but there's also a calm and peace

Fuji TV Program ""Direct Hit LIVE Good Day!"" held a special feature on the 12th regarding the issue of the T-shirt printed with a mushroom cloud worn in the past by BTS, a seven-membered hip-hop group from Korea.

The ""A-Bomb T-shirt"" BTS wore has been causing a stir everywhere, causing the TV Asahi music program ""Music Station"" to suspend their appearance on the 9th.

Saito Tsukasa (39) of the comedian duo ""Trendy Angel"" appeared as a commentator and revealed, ""I've worked with them and spoken to them several times before."" He further commented:

""Their performance and songs are wonderful, performing on a world stage unlike anyone else has until now. They are all young and friendly individuals, their Japanese was good, and they really gave me the impression that they loved Japan. That's why I still don't quite understand why the fuss over the T-shirt led to this, but I do think it's a shame that music and politics had to be mixed together like this.""

Japan times has also decided to report on this.

&amp;#x200B;

u/Rhyethil gave the best possible explanation I found, I am just pasting his comment below-

 

\&gt;Oh boy, here we go again.

\&gt;No offense to the rabbi, but those ""swastikas"" in the flags they waved is actually the album art for Seo Taiji's Classroom Idea. And yes, while the all-black, double breasted trench coat is a uniform piece of the Schutzstaffel for rain and snow conditions, with context of the song they were performing it's more to do with gakuran, Japanese school uniforms.

\&gt;A few things to note about them. It's also referred to as tsume-eri, based on the iconic, tight-fitting, standing collar tunics that they're associated with. They were inspired by the military uniforms worn by the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy. They're a distinguishable symbol of Japanese modern culture, but are also worn in South Korea (BTS wear gakuran in [Run! BTS ep. 39](https://www.vlive.tv/video/58311)), as well as China before becoming a People's Republic. They're still used but was most popular until the 70s; schools nowadays opt for a more colourful and stylized blazer that's more reminiscent of private and Catholic schools.

\&gt;The mid-calf-length coat that you see Seo Taiji and BTS wear is specifically known as a chran. This modification of the original gakuran design became popular among banch, male high school delinquents. It's become a stereotype that anyone who wears chran is the head of, or at least involved in a school gang. Extortion, turf wars, concections with the Yakuza, and will most likely beat you up if you mess with them. For those who know about Jojo's Bizarre Adventures, [Jotaro Kiko](http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Jotaro_Kujo) wears a chran. Which is why wearing a chran during the performance of Classroom Idea is a very important symbol that further compliments the message of ""rebelling against the school system.""

\&gt;Despite this, there is no denying that BTS *did* do a photoshoot with a Nazi symbol on a cap. This was organized by [CCi Magazine for their October 2014 issue](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/btsdiary.com/2014/09/20/picturescan-bts-at-ceci-magazine-october-edition-140921/amp/). Part of the issue lies in the fact that South Korea's history curriculum only tackles the Eastern front of WWII in-depth while merely omitting the Western front and the Holocaust. Such ignorance of the atrocities committed to the Jewish people is the reason why the ""Nazi chic"" fashion trends thrive in Asia. However, this cannot be excused. The coordinator at CCi who did not look into the symbolism on the cap should be reprimanded, because it is ultimately their lack of caution and foresight that has landed BTS into this messy situation.  \*\*NOTE\*\* (EXTRA ADDED)- THERE ARE INCONSISTENCY REGARDING THIS INFO, will add more below. 

\&gt;And I do have a qualm with the rabbi's final words.

&gt;\&gt;It is clear that those designing and promoting this groups career are too comfortable with denigrating the memory of the past. The result is that on young generations in Korea and around the world are more likely to identify bigotry and intolerance as being cool and help erase the lessons of history.

\&gt;Therein lies a large amount of ignorance within his part. BTS is not on some moral high ground, nor do most of their fans follow them blindly and believe that they can do no wrong. With this statement, Rabbi Abraham Cooper is relying on the idea of ""rabid, teenage fangirl"" hysteria to try and get his point across. This kind of generalization time and time again does not reflect the actual population nor values of any fandom, and plays a negative role on the fans of any boy group. This is a personal *opinion* observed by one man, not a universal *truth* accepted by all.

\&gt;Not only does this show me that not only is this move by the Simon Wiesenthal Center is a poorly-informed choice, but a tasteless one, as well. I have nothing against their decision and are free to act upon it, but I do ask that the organization conducts better, factual research before making a hasty statement like this.

&amp;#x200B;

reagarding the Cece Magazine photoshoot, the image in the original is too unclear to confirm anything, some say its photo shopped some say its real. We need more info regarding this. Though apparently the Ceci designer has apolosied for the hat - [https://twitter.com/BTSARMY\_Salon/status/1061828372903284737](https://twitter.com/BTSARMY_Salon/status/1061828372903284737). I am at this moment stuck regarding this so I will go according to what u/Rhyethil and u/sappydumpy has said about this whose comments regarding this I will post in the comments below.

The email address of this Jewish organisation to that we can inform them regarding this misinformation- [information@wiesenthal.com](mailto:information@wiesenthal.com) (its not meant for complaint, it was just on their contact us page, if anyone finds better link then please inform me)

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that matters in times like this as fans (or ex-fans) is our personal relationship to BTS, their music, and how they make us feel. It's about our individual comfort levels, and beliefs, and reactions to them and what's going on. Just as ARMY always try to emphasize how in the end, BTS is made up of seven individual men with unique personalities, talents, and desires and not just idols, we have to remember all that matters is how we interact with them personally, not what the world or the people around us or outrage culture says.

&amp;#x200B;

This goes for any honest reaction to them and these controversies. It doesn't matter if you think this is all more indicative of the horrific relationship between Japan and its neighbors than saying anything about BTS, or if you're deeply disappointed there's no apology from BH, or you're deeply sad they're getting so much grief, or even if you think wearing the shirt makes it hard for you to stan: these are equally valid responses. Don't let anyone on any side tell you how to feel. They can educate or give other perspectives, but only you know how this effects your relationship with BTS as a person and as ARMY.

&amp;#x200B;

If you still support them despite this because you think this is more about politics than them, that's up to you and valid. You're not delusional or just a crazy ARMY, it's a solid belief that can be backed up if you believe in it. If you're not comfortable because it was tasteless, or perhaps to you an unforgivable move and can no longer love them like you used to, that's your very real and defensible opinion, and is 100% okay. That doesn't mean you were less of a 'true ARMY' than someone who disagrees and continues to be a vocal supporter.

&amp;#x200B;

The in-between is also a reasonable place to be - maybe you still love them but this affair has you heartsick, and you need to take a step back. That doesn't make you less appreciative of BTS or what you love/loved about them, it means you need a break to figure out how you really feel. You can come back and be just as supportive as before if you so choose; don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. We've been awash in winning and positivity for many months now and it's been lovely, and this is a gut punch to have to struggle against waves of controversy.

&amp;#x200B;

Internet discourse is ruled by Constant Content and Outrage, and this is fed by the international news cycle that no longer supports journalism and instead quick-hit controversies that drives traffic and is easily absorbed by the masses until they move on to the next issue. Twitter and its fast-bite format and the endless manipulative trolls on there (from all sides) feeds into this, and demand fast, pithy responses to complicated issues and make it hard to have honest discussions. Don't let anyone dictate your response. 

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who has cancelled or downgraded countless faves over the years due to learning things about them I couldn't stomach, I am not stepping back from BTS because after much online research and discussion combo-ed with what I know about them, my fundamental opinions haven't changed much. But that's me. I lived in Japan for a bit, have read intensively on post-war Japan and studied at a university that had strong government ties, and some of my experiences of the Japanese attitude towards Koreans, other Asians, their crimes in WW2 and foreigners in general has me landing in a place of seeing this as political and societal and outside why I like them. (Also, I'm acquainted with how differently most Asians process Nazism and the associated symbolism and have opinions on that as well) But that's me, and me only. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so sorry to Japanese ARMY who have to deal with this and blowback from their family, coworkers, and friends; both my boss and the person who reports to me are violently opposite to me politically, and vocal about it. I have to suppress 30% of my personality to deal and get through, and I hate not being able to speak up about things important to me or to hear my values attacked in casual conversation. I can only imagine what you guys are going through - so many hugs; no matter what happens or even if some of you stop being ARMY, you guys are amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

BTS is supposed to bring pleasure and enjoyment and even catharsis, something they're very open about - they're a conduit for us to feel better about ourselves, not worse. This swamp is so unfortunate, but you're not a bad person if all this mess has effected your pleasure in small or big ways. Breath, and don't be afraid to go with your gut: throw yourself into fighting for them, or step back from BTS, or only bury yourself in their fun side, or just let this blow over. Do you. Yes, they'll lose fans (maybe you'll be one of them!), and this might slow their growth, and it'll come up again and again as these things do with major acts. It sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this too will pass, the news and SNS cycles demands it - what matters is how YOU feel, and your own values. BTS will be fine as a group, they're bigger than ever in their home country, and this doesn't even register to most of the western GP, or won't soon. Many of us will stick around. (But that doesn't make us 'better' than those who don't, just different.) There's so much negativity in the world, and we're bombarded with it from everywhere - do what's right for your head and your heart, nothing more, nothing less. Even when we're confused and fighting and our passion is all over the place and at odds, ARMY is still an astounding fandom, and regardless of size I think it'll continue to be. If you leave or take a step back, that doesn't make your time inside it any less precious or valid.

In light of this issue I feel like we need to address BigHit and how they operate.

BigHit is a good company for the most part. They give Bangtan creative freedom and inspire them to become the best artists they can be. They also offer a great support system butthis is crazy. 

This is all my opinion (and you guys dont have to agree with me):

BigHits biggest flaw is their inaction when it comes to controversy. They just freaking ignore it until it A. goes away B. they can no longer ignore it. They just let BTS get \*dragged\* for any period of time without making any statements about anything. In 2015, they let those sajaegi accusations \*stew\* before they did anything about it. In 2016, again, plagiarism and tons of other defamatory statements were being made on a regular bases and they said \*nothing\*. Only months later did they start saying they were gonna sue people, and even the law suits didnt start happening until much later. The only controversy that was handled somewhat timely was the misogyny one (which had some merit) and that was addressed by Joon himself. The no signal thing they let stew. The military thing they let stew. They Bird thing they let stew. This shirt thing they let stew. The holocaust tribute photoshoot they never gave an extensive apology for because it just kind of went away (they werent very popular then) and now it is coming back to screw them over. 

Bighit drops the ball on this time and time again. And some may say well, sometimes it is better to not say anything because certain issue resolve themselves or saying something wont automatically make things better. It is up to BigHit to ascertain what needs to be addressed and what doesnt, and if is potentially offensive then it should definitely be addressed. It is not normal to wait days, weeks, and months to address issues like these. Most PR teams would jump on things like this within a few hours. Not BigHit. This is not right. 

And I am not removing the wrong from these irresponsible news outlets and keyboard warriors. But we know we cant trust these people who sensationalize and skew facts for clicks and attention. But we should be able to trust BigHit. This has been my biggest issue with BigHit for a long and if they dont act now idk what is going to happen or how salvageable this situation is right now.

I'll be accepting orders until the store closes in April. I'll be going to the store fairly frequently but since they might be sold out of certain items when I go, I can't guarantee how long it will take me to fill your order (especially if it's a large one). If you'd like me to ship things as I get them or get you as much stuff as possible by a certain date (like Christmas or something), please let me know and I'll do the best I can. Thanks!",10,1

I just recently found out that people in Army are outraged that Momoland ""ALLEGEDLY"" disrepected BTS during MGA.  And because of this suspicion, Army are going into various Youtube video comments and other outlets to spew hate.  I even saw a fangirl mention she hopes Jimin steps on Momoland's neck, and that she would help.  For someone who is supposedly Army, this is really disturbing.  BTS didn't go to the UN to speak about ""self love"" and have an anthology of albums promoting ""self love"" and being a great person so that people in Army could go and spew hateful words in their defense.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a fan of BTS, but I am ashamed of Army.  There are too many people who take their fandom for BTS into tribalistic/bullying/disgusting ends.  Bullying others because they ""THINK"" someone disrepsected BTS?  If you watch Momoland's entire reaction to BTS' performance, you see they get very excited, especially when JK pops up.  Because someone theorized that Jane was laughing at Jimin, this makes it okay for Army to bully other fangroups and idols?  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a fairly new ARMY from Portugal and I wanted to ask something.

In my country any movie from abroad is broadcasted with Portuguese subtitles and its original sound, as we hate dubbed versions except for animation.

As such I was expecting to watch the movie with Portuguese subtitles. Indeed we'll get them, but in English! The majority of the Portuguese understand English very well for the reason I stated above, but it's very unfair to pay for a more than usual expensive ticket (10 vs 7) to get subtitles  in a foreign language. We can't even ask for a refund because it's mentioned on the website of the movie theatre.

So my question is... fellow armies from non  English speaking countries, how will it be broadcasted in your country?",26,1

We had our first showcase in a small concert hall in Tokyo, Jimin  reflected, according to BTS' label Big Hit Entertainment, recalling the  groups first 2014 show in Japan. I was surprised at how our \[fanbase\]  ARMY who were in Japan at the time knew us and had come to see us. We've  come a long way to be here at the Tokyo Dome.

It saddens me to  think that not only you ARMY, but many people around the world must've  been surprised recently because of the many circumstances, he added. I  believe there will be many more opportunities for us to meet each  other. I won't be able to forget my first Tokyo Dome performance with  you today. I'm so happy to be with you guys, ARMY. I hope you feel happy  seeing us too.

Photos that showed Jimin donning the shirt in  question in celebration of 2017s Liberation Day began circulating over  the past few weeks, and was [acknowledged](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bts/8484102/bts-japan-tv-appearance-canceled-shirt-abomb-image) as the reason behind the cancelation groups performance on TV Asahi's *Music Station*. Several [sociopolitical situations](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8484226/bts-t-shirt-issue-japan-korea-kpop-history)between  South Korea and Japan may have also played a role in the cooling of  tension that led to BTS appearance being canceled. K-pop, which is  immensely popular throughout Asia,regularly becomes a pawn in East  Asian political conflicts, such as how last year's [THAAD crisis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tamarherman/2018/02/27/korean-entertainment-thrives-on-beneficial-but-tense-relationship-with-chinese-investments/) between South Korea and China saw Korean artists unable to perform in China.",25,1

&gt;Im seeing a lot of comments saying they cant accept that such a widely known symbol was a mistake- but trust me... with the things I saw... it makes sense.  And the apology accepting full responsibility is everything.  Its the only way to erase ignorance and heal the world.

I'm a fairly new fan whose been gradually buying up all BTS's albums, but today I made a disappointing discovery when my latest haul came in the post from MusicKorea.com.

I opened up my brand new copy of WINGS to find that the Polaroid photocard was missing 

I've double and triple-checked looking through the photo book and all the packaging, and it definitely didn't fall out while I was opening it.

The album was completely sealed up with no evidence of being resealed, and the other two albums I'd bought at the same time both had their photocards inside. For this reason I'm doubtful that this had anything to do with MusicKorea.com themselves and that it was most likely an error made during production.

We're both BTS noonas in our 30s so we thought it would be fun to organize a meetup and get to know other older fans. Our partners are super tolerant of our love for BTS, but don't quite share the same passion for the boys that we do. :)

BTW, this is nothing against younger fans -- we just figure we'll have more in common with ARMYs who are 21+ years in age and it will give us the option to meet over drinks.

Our initial idea for a meetup is at Teddy's Bigger Burgers in Greenlake in early December. In case you haven't been keeping up with Bon Voyage, that's the same chain that RM, V and Jimin went to in Hawaii during Season 2. We figure Greenlake is somewhat central based on where some people were saying they were going to see Burn the Stage on the megathread. After the initial meetup, we can organize other outings as desired. 

Here are some ideas we brainstormed for future outings:
- Meeting at a park and eating a la BTS, i.e. grilling food and eating instant Korean noodles and drinking beer 
- Watching the new RUN episodes or other BTS content together
- Karaoke at a place that has BTS songs
- Escape room (RUN ep. 52)

Secret Santa matching is underway and we can't be more excited to start shopping for our Secret Santas! However, before we set our wallets on ^(bultaoreune) fire, we want to announce our other holiday project: Adopt a Stan (AaS).

We hope that by now you guys know the projects we organize are for you guys and our little haven that is r/bangtan. Thus, it is very important for us to make as many of you as possible feel included by having a chance to participate in our projects one way or the other. Secret Santa is  definitely exciting, however the big downside to it is that you have to have a budget in order to participate. So, in the spirit of inclusion, we decided to create the Adopt a Stan project!

Basically, we want those of you who didn't have it in their budget to participate in this year's SS to still experience some holiday cheer. For those of you that sign up, we will send you some BTS goodies like stickers, PCs, and a few other little things. If possible, we'll try to tailor to your bias, but please be aware that the assortments will most likely be random. This is all coming out of our own pockets (but mostly Erin's), and in order to keep mailing costs down, these gifts will be a bit on the small side, so we do apologize for not being able to go all out lol.

&amp;nbsp;

SO! Now that you know what AaS is about, here are the guidelines to participate:

**1**: You cannot be signed up for the Secret Santa.

**2**: You must be in the US (this is solely due to shipping costs - sorry!).

If ANY BTS member were to look at Momolands Instagram right now, they would be absolutely ashamed to call you their fan.  They might even denounce you. They certainly aren't proud. 

BTS had a bad day. Nobody laughed at them, they cringed because it's embarassing to watch a singer fuck up their notes, no matter who it is. 

ARMY is an embarrassment and you're the reason Kpop will never be mainstream in Western society. ",3,1

&amp;#x200B;

The most annoying thing to me is that on the Guardian Twitter post the photo is of one of the right wing Japanese protesters outside the concert so I thought they would mention at least something about the fact this narrative was pushed by them. But if you open the article, the main photo is actually just of BTS and there's no reference to the Japanese right wingers whatsoever.

To brighten things up as I know things have been crazy lately and to - dare I say - look at the positive sides of capitalism, I thought it'd be fun to share some fun things we've done with our BT21 merch or experiences we'd like to share.

Its not even that I'm wildly depressed or anything, I'm just at a point in my life right now where they're one of the only things  that is gauranteed to make me happy and excited. For this reason I dont think I could ""quit"" Bts even if I wanted to, and I don't think I'm alone in that.

That would be fine if being their fan didn't come with so much negative and anxiety provoking baggage. Bts as people make me happy but everything surrounding them often makes me anxious and miserable. This past week has been absolutely harrowing, for example, and it's what originally inspired  me to make this post. It dawned on me how absolutely ridiculous it is that a situation involving people I have never met (and probably will never meet) could affect my mood and thoughts to such an extent. Its just impossible to have such a strong emotional attachment to a group of people without becoming defensive of them in situations like this. And in my case I find it almost impossible not to engage when I see it happening in front of me. It's not just me either, seeing comments from Armys across the world this week has made me realize how many of us are in the same boat here. 

So I wanted to ask Army's who are or have been in this situation (I've read enough similar stories to realize that it seems pretty common in this fandom) how do you balance the happiness Bts brings you with the negativity that often surrounds them? And how do you lessen the dependency you have on them emotionally?",71,1

My sister is a mega fan of BTS and has recently seen them in London which she describes as the best night of her life. As her older brother I have to sit and endure her talking about them all at every opportunity but I understand how much she loves then and would really like to get her something special for Christmas this year to do with the band. All I can remember off the top of my head is her favourite member is Jun by far but other than that I'm unsure on anything else. If any of you have any good ideas on what i could get her that would be greatly appreciated :)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this isn't a stretch but i'd really really like to see fellow armys to not condone outrageous behavior in the cinema

I posted this on my local army facebook group and it's already a concern for me.

I'm seeing a few posts about people screaming and being loud in the cinema, some even bringing their army bombs. I don care if this might be an unpopular opinion, but I really do hope it's kept to a minimum. 

Laughing and moderate cheering is fine, but I've been through other movies where people think its acceptable to scream, shout inappropriate things, and heckle in the cinema which is horrible etiquette...

&amp;#x200B;

Cinema Etiquette is important to some folks &amp; most cinema goers like to enjoy things quietly... The one thing i hate would be going to a movie only to not be able to hear the audio over cheering or a fellow audience member being inconsiderate to others by saying something inappropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

 Not everyone is as symbiotic with that sort of behavior. If we want to be a diverse group of fans that are considerate towards everyone we should know its' important not to act immaturely in public spaces. Just think about it, if Bangtan themselves wouldn't do it, then we shouldn't either. We have already have a massive PR issue with our fandom and the one way to only fix it is to act as exemplary citizens in public spaces. 

&amp;#x200B;

**You can still be positive and enthusiastic moderately ...but there should be a line.**

  
 **PLEASE DON'T BRING YOUR ARMY BOMBS TO THE CINEMA &amp; ACT OBNOXIOUSLY UNLESS IT WAS PRIOR ARRANGED WITH EVERYONE.**

&amp;#x200B;

So please be considerate to your fellow quiet cinema goers.  You might also ruin the experience for new fans or people who are genuinely curious about the movie.",235,1

[https://theoutline.com/post/6588/bts-japan-shirt-nazi-hat-cancelled-concert](https://theoutline.com/post/6588/bts-japan-shirt-nazi-hat-cancelled-concert)

""What hasnt been as reported in current discussions about the cancelled  BTS performance, but which BTS stans across the internet have pointed  out, is that that Makoto Sakurai, the founder of far-right extremist and  ultra-nationalist hate group Zaitokukai, [blogged about the offending T-shirt](https://ameblo.jp/doronpa01/entry-12416625243.html)  on November 5, calling BTS an anti-Japanese group. In the post, he  encouraged his readership to put pressure on TV Asahi and its sponsors  to drop the Korean boy-band, and the issue was [quickly picked up](https://twitter.com/maki2260/status/1061049062357495808&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542296766404000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHupkD2yuwSopAqlDe5Jlvm8vUiww) by [far-right](https://twitter.com/murrhauser/status/1052182502943600641?ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw%257Ctwcamp%255Etweetembed%257Ctwterm%255E1052182502943600641%26ref_url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnextshark.com%252Fbts-jimin-hiroshima-shirt%252F&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542293792605000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8t_BwYFfjT04reJ7MRncMLnP22Q) Japanese [Twitter](https://twitter.com/liyonyon/status/1061083350360764416&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542293792607000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEv2ru69WWZTV8UQRCnO_sV7GeRAQ). BTSs gaffe, in other words, proved fertile ground for anti-Korean sentiment in Japan.""

Rosemarie Ho (writer) also explains how difficult it can be for Korean stars to navigate expectations of loyalty to Korea and its government (though Park Geun-hye, I believe, is a more extreme example and was problematic overall):

""The conservative wisdom that celebrities have no business in politics,  however, still prevails with regards to entertainers like K-pop idols.  First- and second-wave *hallyu* stars rarely speak with regards  to electoral politics or geopolitical quagmires in the Asia-Pacific  region, certainly for fear of offending fans, but also because of  expectations to keep the frivolous realm of celebrities separate from  the serious stuff, lest it destabilize deeply entrenched social norms.  This is especially true when it comes to criticism of the government.  Last year, *The New York Times* reported that former president [Park Geun-hye blacklisted more than 9000 celebrities for being unfriendly to Parks administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/world/asia/south-korea-park-aides-artists-blacklist.html), including *Oldboy* director Park Chan-wook and prize-winning author of *The Vegetarian*  Han Kang. Any indication of perceived anti-Korean sentiment in a K-pop  star translates into the complete destruction of their career. An  infamous case is the singer Yoo Seung-Jun, who was [accused of dodging his mandatory military service](https://www.soompi.com/article/733265wpp/yoo-seung-jun-apologizes-on-his-knees-and-says-he-would-like-to-return-to-korea&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542293792610000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRSMqTYYehyZbQiW0PxcpTeBD4EA),  causing him to be deported and permanently barred from entry to Korea  to this day. In 2009, Korean-American Jay Park was ousted from boy band  2PM for [comments hed made about hating Korea and Koreans](https://www.soompi.com/article/359596wpp/2pm-jaebum-offends-koreans-with-myspace-posts) back in 2005.""

When I read the association's original statement I was deeply touched by the gravity and poignancy of their words, and felt that their voice shouldn't go unheard just because of something as simple as a language barrier... especially to us ARMY!

I'm not a translator by any means (just someone lucky enough to be bilingual) but I tried very hard to convey the emotions and the tone of the entire original statement while preserving the accuracy of the words as much as I can. It's far from perfect, so if there are any mistakes you notice in my translation please let me know!

I hope that this difficult experience will bring us together as ARMY, and serve to educate us as better global citizens!

-------

We are thankful for the opportunity to address our position as victims of the atomic bomb to so many national and foreign journalists as well as BigHit Entertainment in this small peace-loving city of Hapcheon.

Through their ""LOVE MYSELF"" campaign, BTS has been delivering messages of hopes and dreams to youths and all others residing all over the world. They are delivering messages of hope particularly to the countless teenagers and adults who are struggling with depression and self-esteem.

We, the victims of the atomic bomb, have also been receiving the same comfort from their work. We believe that BTS' message and activism sets an example that all of humanity should gather behind in support.

2019 will mark the 74th anniversary of the atomic bomb.

Of the 100,000 Koreans who became victims of the atomic bombs that were dropped on top of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, only 2,400 still survive. The 15,000 first-generation descendants of the original survivors, and their descendants after them, continue to suffer from numerous diseases and chronic conditions due to the aftereffects of the bombs. They have struggled to live under the ignorance of and lack of support from the government and society at large.

But even now it is not too late to repair past damages; we propose that a survey regarding the lives of the Korean atomic bomb victims and their descendants be initiated. It is not too late to amend the Special Act on the Atomic Bomb Victims legislation to allow for medical support.

We propose that a memorial park be built with a monument in remembrance of the 50,000 Korean atomic bomb survivors who later died in agony, including an archive dedicated to educating future generations about this history. We request that mental health services be initiated to help heal the trauma inflicted by the atomic bomb, even with the limited remaining lifespan of many of the victims. We wish to propose a Hapcheon Denuclearization Peace Assembly which will promote a peaceful world free from nuclear weapons, as well as a memorial service dedicated to all victims of nuclear bombs. We would suggest the attendance of the President of South Korea with the hopes that this will ignite the attention and interest of the nation.

We victims of the atomic bomb have not received, for 73 years, a single apology from the United States of America - the nation responsible for dropping the atomic bombs - or Japan - the nation responsible for committing war crimes. We have lived as forgotten entities, having not received any interest or support from the liberated South Korean government during this same time. Now with these series of events we have been presented with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to speak up and be heard.

We have been astonished by some of the Japanese media's behaviors in response to the fact that a member of BTS wore a shirt printed with a picture of the atomic bomb explosion, cosplaying as if Japan were the only victim involved in the atomic bombing. Ignorant of their nation's history as perpetrators of war crimes and imperialism, the Japanese broadcasting companies involved in this incident abruptly canceled BTS' performance on national television and criticized the South Korean supreme court's ruling regarding the forced labor of Koreans by the Japanese.

In consideration of the above, we the victims of the atomic bomb understand and empathize with BTS, which has been under fire from multiple sides, and we humbly accept BigHit's apology.

At this time, rather than considering the perspective that the atomic bombs liberated Korea from Japanese colonialism, we wish for everyone to reflect on the inhumanity of dropping nuclear weapons on Japan, at that time already a nation on the verge of defeat, for the purposes of experimentation which indiscriminately killed not only humans but all life forms in its path. From now on, we hope that both the Japanese government and Japanese media will no longer mislead public opinion or distort information, and allow BTS to perform without further disruption. We especially wish to emphasize that that BigHit's apology statement should not be manipulated or used for political maneuvering against Korea or BTS.

We sincerely hope that there will be no further reason for more victims of the atomic bomb to arise in the Korean peninsula or the world. We hope for your continued attention for the victims of the atomic bomb.

We tentatively hope that next year on August 6th, the 74th anniversary of the atomic bombing, BTS will come to perform at Hapcheon**, known as the Hiroshima of Korea, to spread the message of ""a world without nuclear weapons, a peaceful global community"" with the living victims of the atomic bomb.

We have lived a life full of han* as victims of the atomic bomb and had the traumas of our experience passed down to the next generation, but we hope that this will become the foundation and first step toward a denuclearized peace on the Korean peninsula and serve as a warning to never repeat the mistakes of the past. Thank you.

* han(): a unique Korean word that encapsulates the feeling of sorrow, suffering, and bitterness that is often passed through generations.
** Hapcheon is a city where most current surviving Korean victims of the atomic bomb reside. As a result, the city is known as the Hiroshima of Korea.",46,1

702,2018-11-18,2018,11,18,4,9xzf6x,365 days an ARMY,nonyobiz,1542484544,"The eve of November 17, 2017 was nothing special. It was a Friday night spent at home, watching whatever was on, when I switched to ABC to see what the AMA this year was going to look like. It was then when I heard the announcement of some song named DNA was going to be performed by BTS, and I remembered a dance cover I glimpsed on Instagram of DNA so I thought eh, why not, lets see what the real thing looks like. I never knew in just 30 minutes my life was going to be changed. I saw the seven members appear on stage and sing and dance their hearts out...I was instantly curious. I went to bed that night and decided to look up DNAs music video, then the suggestions showed Not Today, and I was even more intrigued. Finally, I clicked on Blood Sweat and Tears, and the grey-haired angel grabbed a hold on my heart and it was at that moment that I knew I was a lost cause. I spireled down the rabbit hole known as YouTube and only emerged at 4 am with eyes barely half open. The next morning my research started into the members, their personalities, projects and I could feel my heart growing wider with each new info. I ate up the silliness from Excuuusee meee (It was new to me at the time) to the AMA interviews. The theory videos made me even more confused and there was so much content I didnt know where to begin. I found V-live over Thanksgiving break and guess what I did the entire week? When I was able to successfully identify the members in videos and practices I was thrilled (Jin and JK gave me the most trouble). Slowly, bit by bit, they took over everything and everywhere I looked. Songs started invading my plists so much that I had to make a separate one; it was no longer casual listening. BT21 debuted and I was dying to get my hands on them, but no means of doing so resulted in me cross-stitching them. I didnt own any albums and had no clue about getting one either. I tried to show my friends some videos and get them into it as well so we could talk about it, but no such success. In January was when I discovered a girl at my school with a Mang figure hanging on her backpack and I lost my shit by screaming Where did you get Mang? at her. Bless her soul she was so nice about asking if I knew BTS, and I showed her I was listening to Spring Day at the moment. She introduced me to 3 other ARMYs as well. I learned that she was one of the girls Ellen pranked into meeting BTS (the one with the sliding door) and she took me under her wing and guided me through the process. I bought my first albums with them, LY:Her and Wings, went to exhibits, watched new videos, fangirled over the Hixtape, went to the concert in LA,and so much more. 

Over the course of the year, I could realize how BTS was starting to shape my life. The love yourself motto inspired me to really start losing weight and be healthier, take my struggles seriously and talk to someone about it, get a dog (my baby Luna, shes my personal moonchild), and just live. To go out alone, dare to stand up for myself, and just be happy. My mom has been pretty supportive in my new venture, so far as watching and listening to BTS with me to see what they are about. Ive dropped more cash on them than any other artist/group/venture Ive ever known but dont regret a cent (get that second mansion, Jin). Even though I havent been around for a long time, I know that I will be here til the end and beyond. Namjoon, Jin, Yoongi, Hobi, Jimin, Tae and Jungkook hold a very special place in my heart that I didnt know it existed and I am so looking forward to see where else they would take me. 

Ive been super emotional today realizing that its my first anniversary of seeing them. The last 365 days of my life have been one the best ones, how were yours? Any other AMA recruits on here? Veteran ARMYs, what drew you in, and how was your first year? Im always curious to hear it.

710,2018-11-18,2018,11,18,7,9y0tfi,I met Hoseok and Yoongi at the handshake event in Tokyo yesterday!,lesfousdebassan,1542494991,"The title is pretty self-explanatory. The new JP single's physical copies each contained a lottery code to apply for two handshake events, one in the Tokyo region and one in Osaka. I was lucky enough to win two entries, one for Hoseok and one for Yoongi! Here's a recap of the event.

&amp;#x200B;

# The handshake event itself

The event took place at Makuhari Hall, in Chiba, about a 45 minutes train ride away from Tokyo station. Makuhari is a huge exhibition/convention center and the handshake took place in the Event Hall, which is a small concert hall. We were each assigned a numbered  (group) depending on our allotted time. I was in the second and fourth respectively, but got there early enough to see the first group's process. We had to line up outside at a specific time and go through a first security check (tickets were a QR code phone ticket). We then waited inside the building before being allowed in the hall and separating according to the member we met. We underwent a second security check of the tickets and our IDs, as well as being directed to follow some of the guidelines (I was told to remove a bracelet). Overall, it went pretty smooth and I have to give it up to J-ARMYs for being insanely disciplined. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say each group was about a thousand people. That's more than a hundred people per member for a 20 minute slot, on average. As you can imagine, it was *fast.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Handshake #1: Hoseok

I was an absolute wreck waiting in line. Hoseok is my bias, so winning an entry for him felt like a miracle. Turning the corner of that booth was such a strange moment. I had trouble believing I was actually right in front of him. I had brought a nametag, like most attendees, with my name in hangul. When he saw me, he went ""Ooooh, \[name\], \[name\]! Wow!"" My mind went completely blank. *Hoseok is saying my name and shaking my hand? What the fuck?* He made a bunch of silly faces and kept his eyes on me the whole time as I waved good-bye and was ushered out. 

He was taller than I expected. I'm 95% sure they were wearing [these](https://www.billboard.com/files/media/bts-idol-teaser-2018-billboard-1548.jpg) outfits from IDOL. In any case he was all in black. I'd heard people say countless time that he's more handsome in person and boy... It's really hard to convey how gorgeous he looks. My brain had a hard time processing it. His skin is literally golden and his features are *sharp*. Also his hand was very warm and soft, 11/10, would shake forever until my arm fell off. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Getting to the Yoongi handshake: Japanese bureaucracy strikes again

Anyone who's heard my tales of the J-ARMY experience knows being a fan in this country is not easy. Getting tickets to shows is difficult, merch was a lottery in Tokyo, the fanclub customer service is crap... And of course, the handshake event had to have one twist. The morning of the event, we all got our official download links for the phone tickets. The page to download them, however, had an indication saying you could only download ONE ticket, and the remaining ones you had would be ""undownloadable."" It basically made me choose between my Hoseok ticket and Yoongi ticket. I was completely crushed. I won two tickets! Let me see both! 

As it turned out, a friend I made while waiting for Hoseok explained the e-mail was just confusing and that I could still access the Yoongi ticket after I met Hoseok. Thank god for J-ARMY veterans. Thank you for your service. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Handshake #2: Yoongi

The handshake with Yoongi was over before I knew it. Maybe it was because it was later in the day and they were rushing (though they were on schedule as far as I know) or because I was spoiled when Hoseok took time to torture me in the earlier one, but this was *quick*. I'm positive he was wearing the purple/black and gold shirt from IDOL. 

For some reason, my brain expected blonde Yoongi and I got momentarily confused by his hair. He is supernaturally pretty. Really beyond words. He also isn't as tiny as the legends say and I had to look up to him from my puny 168 centimeters. His hand was *massive* which made *me* feel small. I want to also add that while some girl who met him earlier in the day insisted he was  (pure white), I have to disagree. This guy gets *whitewashed*, it's unbelievable. Sure, he is paler than Hoseok (but Hoseok is a statue made of gold carved by ancient gods), but he's got a rather normal asian skin tone. And he's fucking gorgeous. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Should I go to a handshake event?

When I told people I had won entries, I got a lot of envy, naturally. A lot of people said they'd love to take part in a handshake in Japan. Allow me to give my 2 cents, as a now veteran. Unless you live in a neighbouring country with very low cost flights (or will be in the country for the dates), I wouldn't recommend it. I had to spend money myself on train tickets since I live on the other side of the country. But keep in mind that I got the confirmation I won on November 7th and met them on November 17th. Some people only got their confirmation on *November 13th*. That's not a lot of time to plan a trip. It's also not like the korean fansigns, were people can actually speak to the boys. In a handshake, you won't have time to tell them much and you can't give them letters. You'll be paying for maybe 15 seconds of their attention, at most. It was worth it for me, but keep in mind that these events are hard to get into and will likely cost you several hundreds dollars in total costs (a girl I met had spent a thousand dollars to get her entries). The event is free, but the CDs you need to buy and the expenses to get there aren't! 

# Final thoughts

This was an amazing experience, even if super short. I'm really thankful I got to meet both of them and for the wonderful people I met at the event. I have to highlight how well organized this was. Everything was on schedule and smooth, staff was kind and helpful. The confusing e-mail is the only complaint I have. I actually called the event hotline the previous day to clear up something about my foreign name and I was amazed by their patience and care. And J-ARMYs are truly wonderful to be around! I hope I get to take part in other events while in Japan. I'll be at two of the Osaka shows this week so I'm looking forward to seeing the boys again!

* On 18th JPN Nikkan Gendai criticized that there is no impact in any of the artist appearing this year for Kouhaku Utagassen

* According to NHK staff On October of this year we sent our staff to BTS Europe tour and tried to recruit BTS. The decision has been over turned due to the decision on Forced Labor on 10/30

* The media pin pointed that even without Jimins T shirt issue, their appearance would have been difficult. They pointed out that Jimins T-shirt could have not been the main reason.

* BTS is been getting love calls all over the world disregarding the incident. Also their schedules for JPN for next year is already being discussed. Lastly they added for BTS Who are popular within the age group of 10s and 20s. Not appearing in Kouhaku Utagassen which major viewers are seniors, it will not have any impact on BTS popularity at all.

It's rare to find that sort of friendship, and I think the members know how lucky they are to have found it. Since I discovered BTS last year when I was at one of the lowest points in my life, I kind of grabbed onto them like the lifeline that I needed at the time and enjoyed their friendship vicariously with them, so to speak. But now that I'm getting mentally healthier and strong enough to venture out into the world again (to love myself, as they would say), I want to make good friends in my real life, and be a good friend, and maybe even find at least one best friend that I can be as close to as they are to each other.

On that note I could not stand the screaming, yelling, screeching and random declarations of love from my fellow moviegoers. Specifically the last 3 back rows. Anytime their bias popped up on screen OMG DADDY MARRY ME YOONGI UWU. It took my out of the movie and honestly ruined the experience for me. The ending scene where they talk to the camera was the worst. I literally could not hear a thing. Thank god there were subtitles.

This was not everybody though, just the last few rows of 20 or so people. Everyone else was quiet and respectful. And like myself could not wait to get out of theater once it was over to get away from the OTT fangirls(and one guy). At the ending scene one of the loud ones yelled wait Army give your numbers so I can add you to a group chat!!! Ffs the movie wasnt even over yet. 

I understand being excited. I can tolerate some squeals and awes but not at that level.  It was too much. If they ever release another movie Ill wait for the dvd. 

Please for whoever else hasnt seen the movie yet and plans on it, be respectful. Dont fight over who ever is going to marry or date your bias. None of yall will. ",1,1

I was inspired to do more chainmail in part thanks to this subreddit. I was further inspired to make a BTS themed chainmail piece. It is currently incomplete because the clasps I was planning to use have gone missing in the abyss and I have to get more. They will likely turn up once I've ordered replacements, I suspect. 

I think I need to take a row of silver rings off the inner part of the logo to make them more narrow but for a first try, I like how it's turning out. I'm planning to try smaller versions and with other colors.

The two scenes where Yoongi drinks wine really stuck out to me. Firstly, they struck me as odd because he alone drinks wine. Yeah, he pops a bottle of champagne with the boys later on, but I don't recall them actually drinking it together. Yoongi drinks wine by himself the first time in the scene where he eats berries with chopsticks. The second time is when all the boys jump into the pool except for him. He sits off to the side with a glass of red wine. 

Perhaps I'm reading into it too much. Yoongi is an aloof person, and he isn't the only one who drinks in ""Burn The Stage."" Hoseok talks about getting drunk, and the beginning shows the boys sharing a toast with their crew after a concert. It is normal for twenty-somethings to indulge in alcohol, but Yoongi and his wine just felt off to me. ",7,1

784,2018-11-20,2018,11,20,6,9ykyp1,181120 The Music Court's Review Of Love Yourself: Tear,Ayikorena,1542661598,"[Opening tweet:](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063893444613959685) Who knew K-Pop was this poetic? This is a different kind from that of the Rap culture. Its deeper. Completely surprised. Full Album reviews will not be able to sum everything up. Will have to judge songs individually. 

[Intro: Singularity](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063929579482505216)

This Is Amazing! This is entirely spoken poetry with an instrumental support behind it. An extremely fascinating storyline. The choice of language is exquisite. If only BTS could record this in English to show todays artists what real poetry sounds like. 

[FAKE LOVE](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063931552919257089)

Hearing this, anyone would think its just a good sound. Reading the translated lyrics while listening, the story and meaning behind the lyrics truly exceeded expectations. Now understand why their fanbase is this massive.

[The Truth Untold](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063934539829981185)

This song is very mesmerizing. Beautiful yet soothing vocals with truly relatable meaning. To be precise, they have by far exceeded expectations. If only they could show America what music should be. This is what music should be. 

[134340](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063937357450174464)

Woah!!!! Wait what the.... The level of thought and the literary devices used here is impeccable. Using the connotation behind Planet Pluto (useless) to describe ones inferiority to someone who have maybe found something bigger &amp; better in a Planet Eris. Woah! 

[Paradise](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063939388717981696)

How do they do this? This song is as deep &amp; as good as motivational speaking gets. The way they put thought and critical language into this song is astonishing. Not to mention the sound coming from their production and vocals. At this moment the world has frozen. 

[Love Maze](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063941094730166272)

The use of symbolism winter and the focus on how lies can ever so slightly destroy a bond.   Beginning to think BTS have the best form of lyricism in relation to meaning and content. 

[Magic Shop](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063943553280176130)

RM is simply GENIUS. This level of writing cannot be described any further. This song has hit where it relates most. Speaking about ones pain often comes back to haunt you, &amp; telling you to cheer up isnt going to help so how about I just tell you my story? Woah  

[Airplane pt. 2](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063945922508255232)

A storyline of vulnerability and fighting on the road to perfection (becoming a star). No words to explain how relevant and how underrated BTS is. 

[Anpanman](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063947717389381632)

Simply saying, I may be the weakest hero the world has ever seen, but I have done things even Superman couldnt have done. Without supernatural powers, I was still able to save someone in need. The best of the best. Is BTS.

[So What](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063949203821346816)

This is the kind of music people battling insecurities should be listening to. Saying you see your own flaws &amp; people spell them out to you everyday. Since you already know what your imperfections are, its time to get over it &amp; say SO WHAT?  Incredible! 

[Outro: Tear](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063951285655748608)

What a way to end this project. This is truly was mind blowing. SPEECHLESS! Just read below. It is amazing. Yes it is. 

[Final thoughts:](https://twitter.com/TheMusicCourt/status/1063952426665832448) This is a masterpiece. There is no other way to describe it. People say BTS is trash only because they dont take the time to translate the lyrics and understand. Maybe even with the translations BTSs Artistry will still be too complexed to understand.   Seems like theres a lot of excitement around RM of BTS. His writing was immaculate on Love Yourself: Tear. Would love to get into some more of his work later on. ",20,1

So Im a huge fan of BTS but Im fairly broke. I decided to save up to do Secret Santa this year without realizing the Adopt a Stan thing existed (whoops lol) and I was just thinking about how there are a lot of ARMYs out there that probably cant afford to get merch. I was wondering if we could do something like the Adopt a Stan program more regularly, like maybe 2-3 times a year or every other month or something? And instead of doing something big (like official merch), it could just be small things, like some fan made photocards or stickers or something. Just to spread the love to ARMYs who cant afford to get stuff.

I can never take off the mask
Because the me behind this mask
Is not the one you know
Make up to wake up today too
And dress up to mask on
In order to become the me that you love
In order to become the one that you love
I quit the XX that I liked so much
Just for you
I put on clothes that I have, excessive makeup
Because your laughter and happiness is the scale of my happiness 

The whole song changed for me. How about you? Any songs you maybe overlooked or didn't like that changed once you read the lyrics? ",88,1

Apologies if this has been covered in another post as I couldn't find anything in an initial search! I'm turning 31 soon and relatively new to ARMY. I fell into this journey about a month ago and it's been super fun aside from the internal conflict I felt when I discovered that all the members are younger than me  

I do feel a little isolated as an older fan. I have one friend who is a casual fan but otherwise I'm very wary of forcing this ""hobby"" on any other friends my age for fear of being judged.... But I'd love to connect with other fans my age (even better if we could meet up in person!).  Any suggestions on ways to find them? I don't really use FB. 

I've really enjoyed how warm and inclusive this Fandom has been so just trying to find other older fans like me!",8,1

Excerpts from article:

""2! 3!"" debuts at No. 1 on *Billboard*'s [World Digital Song Sales chart](https://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/world-digital-song-sales)  this week, selling7,000 downloads in the week ending Nov. 15,  according to Nielsen Music. Previously, ""2! 3!"" had never appeared on a *Billboard*  chart, with this week's download total representinga remarkable 17,610  percent increase in sales. The cut also earned 137,000 on-demand audio  streams in the week ending Nov. 15, up 37 percent compared to last week.

As a means to show worldwide support for the band, the online initiative [\#ProjectBuy23](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProjectBuy23?src=hash)encouraged  fans to download and ""gift"" purchases of the track to make a statement  that fans are still supporting the band despite the headlines. ARMY  focused on ""2! 3!"" as the track largelyconsidered to be the first song  BTS wrote and releasedspecificallyfor fans. The boom-bapinspired  track's Korean title roughly translates to ""Still Wishing for Better  Days"" and is meant to be an uplifting song for which fans canfind  comfort. The guys shout a few thank yous throughout the track and  encourage a sense of hopefulness even in the toughest times.",3,1
897,2018-11-22,2018,11,22,10,9z9oau,1181121 Rolling Stone - A K-Pop Movie Beat Out One Direction In U.S. Theaters,FakeuLarb,1542851784,"[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/a-k-pop-movie-beat-out-one-direction-in-u-s-theaters-758874/](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/a-k-pop-movie-beat-out-one-direction-in-u-s-theaters-758874/)

Boy band [BTS](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/bts/) has another few accolades to add to its litany of milestones this year. After having an [album debut at Number One](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bts-kpop-albums-bands-global-takeover-707139/) and being the first Korean group to [play a U.S. stadium](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-live-reviews/bts-citi-field-live-review-733759/), the [K-Pop](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/k-pop/) group released a film this weekend that is alreadyAmericas highest-grossing event-cinema music production.

*Burn the Stage: The Movie*, a behind-the-scenes film of the  bands 19-city Wings Tour in 2017, has netted 1.4 million admissions  since opening on Thursday, according to its distributor Trafalgar  Releasing. That number eclipses the 1.2 million admissions garnered by  One Directions 2014 film*One Direction: Where We Are*, and  makes BTS movie the best-selling film in the global event cinema genre  (which comprises live and recorded entertainment on a theater screen,  including sports games, ballets and operas) of all time.

The concert documentary also debuted at Number 10 in the U.S. box office, ahead of major American films such as*Green Book* and*At Eternitys Gate*thatopened  the same weekend. It has also raked in $3.6 million thus far, the most  any event-cinema film has made in the country, andclaimed the sixth  spot in the U.K.s weekend chart, generating $830,000.

For that record to go to a documentary about a South Korean music  group whose biggest hits barely have a few words in English  and within  the seven-member BTS itself, only frontman RM likes to conduct  interviews in English  is unusual, but not aberrational. In the last  year, K-Pop has seen unprecedented interest from U.S. audiences, which  American music industry executives and fans say is due to the genres  meticulous performance style and wholesome, optimistic energy. BTS,  specifically, has attracted scores of American listeners with its pop  boy-band motif  largely absent from Western music since One Directions  split in 2015  and enthusiastic social media presence.

More broadly, BTSs continued milestones also mark the increasing  globalization of American music tastes: Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankees  Spanish-language Despacito was a record-breaker in 2017, BTSs  Korean-language Fake Love is on track to be one of this years biggest  hits and fellow K-Pop group Blackpink just signed with Interscope and  Universal to target the U.S. pop market, just to name a few blips in the  usually English-centric music business.",22,1

I know how to get to Home Plus, Monopoly and obviously Line so we have a broad selection. Monopoly exclusively has the diaries/planners, totes, sticker packs, photo albums, etc and Home Plus has those large cushions and pillows.

909,2018-11-22,2018,11,22,19,9zd21l,Announcement - Census 2018,BTSprojects,1542883017,"**Hi again /r/bangtan!**

It's around this time of year again, and that means [IT'S](https://imgur.com/7cXWO7h) [CENSUS](https://imgur.com/osyo6F1) [TIME](https://imgur.com/DqHSsoO)! With the permission of the mods, we have run the census and 'boy meets /r/bangtan' projects for both [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/) and [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8v81o5/2017_rbangtan_census_book_and_full_results/). 

We will be running these projects again this year, and considering the huge increase in subscribers and everything which has happened in this year, the census will be sure to be interesting!

This is a pretty long post, so there is a tl;dr at the end for our skim readers. 

#What is the census and 'boy meets /r/bangtan'?

For those who are new to /r/bangtan, we conduct a subreddit [census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census) every year to get an idea of what our community looks like. We also conduct the 'boy meets /r/bangtan' project and send the results as a census book to BTS. We do this as there are limited opportunities for us i-fans to show the ways in which the members have touched and affected lives from all around the world, from different walks of life and circumstances. Through this project, we feel that we can show the extent of their impact, even if it's just in our little community, and share the things that we love about them. 

#Census info 

The census this year will be run from 1 - 14 Dec (KST), for a period of 14 days. The results of the census will be posted as soon as possible after analysis of short answer questions. 

The census itself will be completely anonymous. We have published the questions here in advance in case there are mistakes or corrections that need to be made. 

The questions are the same questions from last year with a few small updates. The current list of questions is [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Gbz-otvB810PNlc5RMDbdahuLo3AFEwcBxoNusVqXE/edit?usp=sharing) and will be asked through Google forms. In summary, there will be the following types of questions and linked are opportunities to provide comments and suggestions on the different sections: 

&amp;nbsp;

**Multiple choice or checklist style questions**: (most questions are compulsory for responders) 
 
* demographic questions ([feedback](link))
* questions relating to discovery and consumption of BTS / kpop ([feedback](link))
* questions relating to use of /r/bangtan  ([feedback](link))
* questions regarding bias and favourite song/album/mv/choreo  ([feedback](link))
 
**Short answer questions**: (completely non-compulsory for responders)  
 
* favourite BTS memory and things about BTS and each member ([feedback](link))

Unfortunately, we have had to reduce the length of responses for short answer questions, as the increased size of the subreddit means it is no longer feasible for us to sort through extensive answers - this was one of the reasons for the delay of results for census 2017. However, the discussion thread is open for those who want to give longer responses!

 
&amp;nbsp;
  
Any questions, comments or other feedback on the census and the questions and their inclusion in the census book would be greatly welcomed and appreciated! We would rather address these issues in advance rather than on the day.  We hope that everyone can participate in answering the census! 

#The census book 'boy meets /r/bangtan'

As BTS has stopped accepting gifts (and sadly, our [books fall under the category of gifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7u94me/fanclub_manager_rbangtan_books_classified_as_gifts/)), we are coming up with a new and improved format that can still accomodate the same features as before, but in a manner that can be classified as a letter: watch this space! Rest assured, boy meets /r/bangtan v3 will happen in some form or another (this may end up being a newsletter or a pamphlet linking to an e-book etc.). We welcome comments and suggestions. 

Like in previous years, we will not include all census data in the final product sent to BTS (e.g. we will not include the 'who is your bias' question in the final copy of the book).

We hope to include the same features as previous census years, especially artists' illustrations and comments from subscribers regarding some of their favourite things about BTS, their work and the members; we hope to run a thread parallel to the census as we have done in previous years (see [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5frd1d/bts_projects_discussion_thread_boy_meets_rbangtan/) and [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7gmkdz/discussion_thread_boy_meets_rbangtan_project_2017/) threads). For a quick flick through, see [this video](https://youtu.be/HaUlx_uLsKM?t=42) of the 2017 census book. 

In addition to sending a hard copy version to the boys, we will also provide a e-copy for /r/bangtan. There likely will be some small variations between the two versions, for privacy and other concerns.  

#Getting involved

Everyone can participate in the census just by answering the survey form! You can also participate in the discussion threads (see [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5frd1d/bts_projects_discussion_thread_boy_meets_rbangtan/) and [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7gmkdz/discussion_thread_boy_meets_rbangtan_project_2017/) examples).

Each year, we have illustrators and artists illustrate their favourite aspects or performance of the members; please see the [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5vporb/census_project_boy_meets_rbangtan_final_update/) and [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8v81o5/2017_rbangtan_census_book_and_full_results/) census books for examples of some of this wonderful art! You may also choose want illustrate something else. 

Our translators have taken the census book to the next level each year and our projects would be nothing without them; if you know Korean and are willing / able to translate, we would greatly appreciate any amount of translation help.  

If you want to help with the data sorting of the short answer questions or proofreading or anything else, and are available during December-January, we would appreciate any help!

**If you want to illustrate, translate or help out in any other way, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-uLBcz16fFrpQqlmtboIRENPL7scc3oi3Y1YxqiigKjVi_Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)**; this does not obligate you in any way, but acts only as an expression of interest. 

#Funding 
 
The BTSprojects team will cover all costs of printing and shipping. We would like to emphasize that **NO donation or contribution is necessary** to participate. We want to make a project that the whole subreddit can freely participate in.  

We are a group of volunteering fans (not the subreddit's mods as some of you may have assumed), so if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping costs, [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and dont forget to **add username | Census Project | cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name in the comment box**. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations.

As with all our projects, we will be making a charitable donation as our gift with any excess monies. Our top choice is BTS' [LOVE MYSELF campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/), a partnership between BTS, their label, and UNICEF. However, if you have more suggestions, feel free to let us know.

#Other 
 
We have also received interest in physical copies of the 2017 census book; we really apologise for the delay of this, as we had to prioritize time-sensitive projects. However, we really do hope we can offer physical copies before census 2018 begins.

913,2018-11-23,2018,11,23,1,9zfqu3,Do you have any funny BTS-related stories to share?,Speedy_Cheese,1542905707,"My SO and I stumbled on this idea last night and I thought it would be a fun way for ARMY to cheer up, share some stories, and get some belly laughs: do you have any hilarious BTS-related stories you can share with fellow ARMY?

I have two I'd like to share! If you'd like my very dramatic flare read through it all, but I have also provided you a TLDR as well to get to the meat. Hope you enjoy my embarrassment and hilarity. 

\*\*1.) How I humiliated myself to FIRE in front of my best friend\*\*

My best friend and I dance together all the time, it's our thing that we have done together for over a decade now. We often show each other cool new routines we've discovered that we'd like to try out and after seeing the FIRE MV for the first time I was practically bouncing off the walls I was so excited to show her. I set up the MV to play at the chorus so I could give her an exciting intro. When she came over and we started warming up she asked if I found anything new I'd like to show and grinning \*\*very smugly\*\* with great self-satisfaction I slunk over the the computer really hamming it up, declaring: ""Why I'm so glad you asked. My pick for this week is . . ."" I turned on the clip and as the music blared I started thrashing my arms wildly a la Jin and yelled ""FIYAAAAAAAAA--"" then smashed -- I mean \*\*SMASHED\*\* my left elbow into the bookcase, knocking things off of it, and absolutely wrecking my poor funny bone. I'm talking full shoulder to fingertip throbbing, tingling, lost ALL sensation for a moment. I never broke anything, just a savage crack to the elbow. I fell on the floor cradling my elbow while screaming as the music played on, and she sank down next to me laughing. We laughed SO hard we started crying, my SO even came downstairs to check on us because we were sobbing and howling so loudly over it. Now whenever FIRE comes on and my bestie and I are in the car together we always bust out laughing. 

TL/DR: My best friend and I learn dances together and I tried to introduce the FIRE choreography so cool but ended up bringing my elbow up hard and solid on a bookshelf. I knocked things off of it and wrecked my poor funny bone, causing me and my best friend to sink to the floor and actually sob laughing.

\*\*2.) How my non-ARMY boyfriend went with me to see Burn the Stage in theater and we got a fantastic running in-joke out of it.\*\*

My SO is not what you'd call a BTS fan, he simply respects them as artists and how much they mean to me personally -- so when he offered to go see Burn the Stage with me I was touched. I told him I was happy going by myself and he didn't have to, but he insisted we make it a date night. (Best boyfriend everrrrrr)

After reading some of the comments here about negative theater experiences (screaming etc.) I was worried about getting embarrassed. After all, myself and the SO are 30 and as I said he is not ARMY, so I warned him the crowd might be rambunctious. He just said: ""Look, this may be the closest some of these people get to seeing BTS live. Lets try to be understanding and let people enjoy in their own way."" Fair enough!

Overall I was impressed by the crowd at the theater! Some cheering/screaming/laughing but nothing out of the ordinary from what you'd expect at a theater. Suddenly near the end of the film Jungkook is talking on the screen and this girl just randomly screamed out at the top of her lungs: ""SHOW ME YOUR ABS!!!"" The two teenage girls on my left were so clearly embarrassed by this and one of them sputtered ""Oh my God, RUDE!"" My SO and I meet eyes and he can see I am completely mortified. We both couldn't hold it in, we just busted out laughing. I tried to be quiet because I did not want to embarrass the poor girl but it was just so funny, random and CRINGEY that I couldn't hold it back. 

As we were leaving I was a little peeved talking about it. My SO commented on how the film was very thoughtful and the boys had put a lot of effort into the meaningful metaphors for the scene transitions but all this girl was worried about was: ""WHERE ARE THE ABS?"" In the car I was going on a double standard rant: ""No respect! I mean seriously? If this were a girl group we were watching in a theater full of men and one of them yelled out ""SHOW ME YOUR BODY"" at the screen people would be calling it sexist and creepy, because it is. It doesn't matter if it is a male or a female, that is objectifying."" And he responded: ""Well you know what you have to do now to even the playing field?"" -- ""What?"" -- ""SHOW ME YOUR ABS!"" It totally dissolved the tension and we both just lost it laughing. But it didn't stop there. It has evolved into this thing my SO and I do now. We'll be in bed drifting off to sleep and he'll say: ""Can you do something for me before bed?"" -- ""What?"" -- ""SHOW ME YOUR ABS!"" It keeps escalating. The other day I busted into the bathroom while he was having a shower, ripped back the curtain and yelled ""SHOW ME YOUR ABS!"" He screamed back ""OH MY GOD, RUDE!"" And we just went to pieces laughing. All this because my SO decided to tag along for the BTS Burn the Stage film! 

TL/DR: My boyfriend isn't ARMY but went to Burn the Stage with me. I was scared about rowdy fans and people were polite overall, but one girl screamed ""SHOW ME YOUR ABS!!!"" at Jungkook which disturbed some movie goers, myself included. While my SO and I talked about double standards we turned ""SHOW ME YOUR ABS"" into an in-joke between us that still continues and keeps us laughing. 

Alright friends, do you have a ridiculous/hilarious BTS-related story you'd like to share? I can't wait to read them!",97,1

First and foremost I apologize if I'm doing this wrong. Moderators here, please let me know.  
  
I'm trying to find 5 of these photos for a friend of mine who missed out on going to BTS' concert. She's been in a bit of a slump lately and I wanted to make her feel better. I know her mother managed to get 2 of the 7 and I want to offer her the remaining 5. I've triple checked and these are the people I'm looking for: RM, Suga, V, J-Hope (cute name lol), and Jin. We're located in the states; California to be exact so hopefully we can find a seller from there? I'm hoping to find someone who has all 5 to save on shipping. When I saw the prices for these things my eyes bulged. Why are these so expensive? Does ""Premium"" mean they talk back to you or something? lol  o.o  
Regardless, my budget is around $150-200 (hopefully with shipping and PayPal fees included please).  
  
thank you everyone! I'm not into BTS or K-Pop, but it makes my friend really happy which is nice to see. She's always struggled with a few mental demons and since finding out about these guys early last year I've seen a tremendous improvement in her overall demeanor. Especially with how she looks at life, it's great. I don't know anything about these people, but from she tells me they seem lovely (helps justify spending so much for their images haha).",17,1

First thing: this stuff feels amazing to put on. Like its the best feeling. It took a minute to dry and then I went about my day, cooking, talking, eating/drinking, etc (keep in mind its thanksgiving so Im eating/drinking a lot). I also chew my lips constantly so I was positive it looked crappy. I went to check it (after about 7 hours of wearing it) and [this is what it looked like.](https://imgur.com/a/FVEMEr5) Basically no visible wear. I even aggressively rubbed it with my hand (just to check) and it didnt rub off on my hand or smear at all. I also didnt notice any lip marks on my cups. Im about to take a shower and Ill update this with what it looks like after that but heres how Id rate it:

Feel: 9/10
Color: 7/10
Price: 6.5/10 (it was like $25, its fairly large and has a really detailed Cooky head on top but still. A bit pricey)
Durability: 10/10
Ability not to smudge/get on stuff: 10/10
Overall: 8.5/10",17,1

If you have a chance to spend some time in a foreign country with one BTS member, who would you choose? Based on BV, they each have their own ups and downs as a travel companion...

I mean when life gives you lemons, right? 
Okay and the last one from BV3 ep 7 I believe it was, when they had to print the pictures that they took during the trip and pinned them on the map, that was a really especial moment.

Back then, this temporary tattoo served as a hint for their HYYH comeback later that spring. However, it seems like Jimin is back with this tattoo, and it has been spotted several times during concerts and performances over the past month. With that being said, what do you think this means? It seems like ARMY are very split on whether this tattoo is temporary or permanent, since we have been seeing this tattoo for over a month now, and it does not look like it has faded. On the other hand, this happened very closely to this year's MAMA, so it does not seem coincidental.

Their music is so beautiful and I listen to it everyday just to make me feel better. Although I just found out about them several months ago, they've inspired me to take a more musical approach when I get older, and that's to probably become a singer, more specifically, a Kpop idol.

The thing is, though, that just sounds ridiculous, considering that 1) I have no Asian ethnicity, and 2) I possibly have Asperger's syndrome. It's a stupid dream, but it's a dream I want to pursue. I've always had a good singing voice and some ability to dance, and maybe it would help me show all the kids in school that I'm not just a person that they can tease. But I'm afraid of people judging me; almost all the kids in my school think that BTS and Kpop music is trash.

Is this really a stupid dream that I have? Something I would love to do in life, something that I would work hard for years to do, and then realize that it's never going to happen? ",1,1

https://i.redd.it/nuur23tzki021.png

&amp;#x200B;

I was inspired to do more chainmail in part thanks to this subreddit. I was further inspired to make a BTS themed chainmail piece. ~~It is currently incomplete because the clasps I was planning to use have gone missing in the abyss and I have to get more. They will likely turn up once I've ordered replacements, I suspect.~~  Clasps were found! I have completed the bracelet with some changes.

~~I think I need to take a row of silver rings off the inner part of the logo to make them more narrow but for a first try,~~ I like how it's turning out. I made the logo more narrow so it was more accurate and I changed the way I connected the center. I like this better.

Here is the process, sans the part where I changed the width of the logo and the connection. This may be the biggest bracelet I've made- it contains over 300 rings.  I'm planning to try smaller versions and with other colors, plus I've picked up some charms to play with on them.

[The Process](https://imgur.com/gallery/ev8ZqCs).

&amp;#x200B;

Doing this was because I wanted to and also I think because of this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9p6d4w/has_bts_contract_renewal_caused_you_to_reflect_on/) by [u/TheDiseaseCalledLove](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheDiseaseCalledLove) .",2,1

With 1D, it was the guys' 'dorky' personalities and closeness with each other that sucked me in; their music was always more of an afterthought. Sure, 1D had a ton of bops, but they could have made an album making throat sounds and I'd have listened to it on repeat. As a Directioner, I spent most of my time ""shipping"" the members, editing picture and making gifs and stalking tumblr blogs.

With BTS, initially it was watching their music videos and dance practices and being blown away by the sheer talent that made me dig deeper into who they are. As with 1D, their lovable personalities and relationships with each other cemented me as a fan. I find myself working harder to understand BTS' music and their message, not just because of the language barrier and the complexities of the Bangtan Universe, but also because of their layered lyrics and how easily I can relate them to my own experiences. I also find myself much more critical of the boys' music and creative output than I was with 1D, which may just be a function of me growing older and more mature. Being an ARMY has led me to explore other hobbies and skills like learning Korean, dancing, and video editing.

This is not to say that one fandom experience was superior to the other. I was equally invested in both fandoms (sometimes to an unhealthy extent), and both provided me with endless hours of happiness and entertainment.",174,1

I have watched most of their shows and MVs and find myself searching for more content daily through Bangtan bombs and twitter and such. For those of you who have full time jobs/ are a full time student, once you are over the discovery phase how have you fit BTS into your daily life without feeling obsessive? ",58,1

i was watching them on TV open up a year-end award show with fake love and they all wearing the first outfits in the mv

it was so cold so they were freezing and namjoon first part came and he started rapping but his voice was so soft spoken low volume &amp; cracking i was like this is the first time i see namjoon like this is the mic not working what's going on 

And then the other members sang their parts and Taehyung added some ariana grande type of Falsetto and i was on the floor lol because he sounded so good &amp; i couldn't believe he did that 

\* this made me wish they would play more with their vocals now \*

&amp;#x200B;

and the camera goes back to Namjoon Rap part two and he was wearing over his outfit a very big padded jacket someone throw out to him on stage and his voice came back but was still shaking so i was like aww poor namjoon he was so cold he couldn't rap at first and was so worried about him  and then my brother came and changed the channel and we start fighting because i missed the rest of the performance

i know it just a dream but now i suddenly feel extremely soft for namjoon because he looked so helpless T-T

&amp;#x200B;

second dream is so random i saw jungkook planking on the floor in IKEA while i was shopping and i just walked past him while smiling

Since BTS is a huge inspiration for me and my career, I went back and started doing some covers of BTS songs to train my skills and show respect to my favorites (Jimin and J-hope)

The thing is, soon I won't be able to put out music whenever I feel like it because of this company I'm with now, so I want to release everything while I still can.

2019
Early 2019 new group debuts
BTS still on tour until spring
BTS around to support new group and not overshadow them, do some collabs, release maybe a ""goodbye"" type video to 23 or Anpanman or another classic which is released towards end of year. MAYBE record but not release ep for new concept ( I am in two minds about whether they will do that).
Vocal line releases some stuff.
Jin exits by end of 2019 for 21 months

2020
Suga releases a mixtape and maybe rapline does some stuff.
Rapline enlists by spring 2020.
Big hit releases some unreleased music in 2020 from new concept.
2020 vocal line is doing other projects, acting, presenting and Jungkook solo career launches.
By end of 2020, V and Jimin have enlisted.

2021
Jungkook solo career in full swing, keeping flame alive.
Mid/late 2021 Jin back doing teasers
Late 2021 rap line home, start working together.

2022
 new rapline music dropped by new years 2022.
 Late 2022 vocal line back, big new music video release by end of the year.

Time for reunion comeback for around 2.5 years before jungkook has to enlist and contract ends in 2025.

*Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is an experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine.*

It is *not* typically sexual in nature, most people who consume ASMR do so for relaxation and its anti anxiety effects.

I have searched the sub for ASMR content and found a few bits here and there but nothing along these lines.

It's widely agreed in this fandom that Min Yoongi's voice definitely has calming qualities, and there are many instances where ASMR has cropped up in content.

* The Run! BTS episode with the village where [Yoongi whispers](https://youtu.be/7WzUVY3nLVM) - sorry its a loop, it's all I could find

* [This compilation](https://youtu.be/PVh1c6mYiFg) of softly speaking BTS

* RM's verse in [Ddaeng](https://youtu.be/5yoS0y3xflg) - again, sorry it's a loop

* Possibly unpopular opinion but I also find RM's verse in [Look Here](https://youtu.be/WXreC6e0bgM) quite calming

* I enjoy gentle make up application and hair styling etc, so the start of [this bangtan bomb](https://youtu.be/XPRhT5vFPdg) for example is really relaxing to me (even with the volume on).

I typically prefer unintentional ASMR (like from the bombs and run episodes) but for those that haven't seen BTS also did an ASMR style commercial for [Coconut chicken](https://youtu.be/fk49PQDCAgU) last year. I spent half the time laughing at it though, J Hope and Jin are so extra 

Has anyone found any other ASMR triggers in the content? If you haven't yet, I wouldn't recommend searching BTS ASMR in youtube, unless you're into the ""imagine he's your boyfriend"" kinda thing (I am not).",40,1

I know from the Take Care of My Refrigerator episode Jin has ginseng? And in one video of them rehearsing they said Jins throat was sore so he was wearing a mask. They also seem to get PT and stretching from Burn the Stage.

The article isn't actually that negative. I think they just used a title with conflict to draw in readers (\*eyeroll\*). 

But it's nice that they included quotes from the members (with excerpts for JK and Jin) and linked to text of their acceptance speech rather than just reporting on the wins. 

Newsweek isn't an entertainment-focused publication, so at the risk of stating the obvious, I'll say that this level of coverage for BTS the next day and with full quotes shows that the American media considers BTS to be extremely newsworthy and a top traffic draw. 

As a longtime Kpop fan, this continues to be exciting for me, because just a few months ago, it wasn't this way at all!",48,1

1158,2018-11-29,2018,11,29,4,a19b07,Funniest misheard lyric stories/examples?,Speedy_Cheese,1543432300,"Back again looking for another reason for us to all have a BTS related laugh! This time I am looking for your funniest examples or stories about misheard lyrics. Considering that BTS is so internationally loved and many of us international fans are not native/fluent Korean speakers, sometimes Korean can sound very similar to words in our native languages. (This is not exclusive to English! Please share funny stories/examples from your native language, we all have access to a translator these days!)

I have two that I can think off right now:

One of my friends works at a local record store and I was looking everywhere for a copy of LY: Answer but every store I tried was sold out, so he hid a copy for me out back when a new shipment came in. When I went to pick it up he told me that the store kept a copy of it to put on in the store as it was selling well so due to popularity they wanted to have a listen. My friend was wondering what all the fuss was about with these guys and had to check them out. He says to me:   


""I have to say, their music is really good! It's quality pop. I liked that first track, Euphoria? Super catchy, but a bit of a weird choice for the first track of the album you know?""

I was beyond confused at this point and asked him to elaborate and he says:  


""Well why would you choose a song dedicated to your cousin as the first track on an album?""  


I'm laughing at this point and start shouting ""What? What are you talking about?!""

""Doesn't he mention his cousin in the chorus?""  


Me, absolutely choking by this point: ""It's you are THE CAUSE of my euphoria, not you are MY COUSIN, my euphoria!""

By this point I am actually falling all over the counter laughing and the two of us are just losing it. Unfortunately for my friend my SO was with me for all this and he refuses to let this die.  Whenever Euphoria comes on in the car now my SO and I will scream ""YOU ARE MY COUSIN, MY EUPHORIA"" and just erupt. My God, the amount of BTS in-jokes between us now. 

**TL/DR: In ""Euphoria"" my friend thought Jungkook said ""You are my cousin, my euphoria"" instead of ""you are the cause of my euphoria"" and now he can't live it down.** 

And speaking of my SO and in-jokes, on to part 2:

Since LY: Answer was my first BTS album I was playing the almighty heck out of it in the car. My SO took to calling Fake Love ""The Salsa Song"" because he kept hearing ""isseosseo"" as salsa and would yell that out at random to make me laugh . . . now thanks to him I can never un-hear that. Fake Love is kind of infamous with us now because when I first started listening to the guys I'd play them on youtube while cooking. While I was making breakfast one morning he came out to me chanting ""BACON LOVE, BACON LOVE, BACON LOVE"" as I was frying bacon and he doubled over laughing behind me. Now it is not only the salsa song, but we also spontaneously yell ""BACON LOVE"" when listening to it, too. It's official: we've made up our own crack chants. (Oh God, I can't believe the many different ways I have managed to embarrassed myself in a public forum courtesy of BTS). 

**TL/DR: SO mistook the lyrics ""isseosseo"" as ""salsa"" and refers to Fake Love as ""The Salsa Song"". Another alias we have for Fake Love is ""Bacon Love"" after being caught chanting that while making breakfast.** 

Last random crack mention (not quite misheard lyrics but I really couldn't resist sharing this one): The SO has no idea what a lot of the songs are called but he specifically gets ""Just Dance"" stuck in his head a lot. So we're in the car with LY:Answer playing and he suddenly says to me: ""put on that song by BTS I likes, would ya?"" -- ""You're gonna have to be more specific than that."" -- ""The one that sounds like a [peanut butter baby meme remix](https://youtu.be/2gfnYHjWKDU?t=69)"" and he sings [this part](https://youtu.be/IiW1kEJDBDQ?t=47) of the song at me. Oh my God you guys, I DIED -- I laughed so hard I nearly had to pull the freaking car over.  ""Just Dance"" will forever be the peanut butter baby bop to me. 

So lets have it, what are your best misheard lyric stories and examples? ",137,1

A lengthy, positive Burn the Stage review from India. It's quite detailed and respectful of the group and its fans.

""The film circumvents the energy and bombast of the groups performances  to show us the moments between the music. We get quick breaks amidst the  mad rush of the stage, anchored by close-ups of cold towels and ice  packs on injured necks, as assistants hastily re-apply make-up before  the next performance. Like the band members themselves, the film doesnt  linger on these difficulties. Instead, it accepts them as a common  (perhaps even necessary) fallout of being the hottest boy band on the  planet.""  ",6,1

storm - a violent disturbance of the atmosphere  with strong winds and usually rain, thunder lighting or snow.

/ / / / /




I always wondered why we hid from storms as a child. I always wondered why storms were named after people. Now, as an adult, I wonder why a child's innocence allows them to do and see so much.

When I was young, in my mind, a storm was the perfect way to dance with the tall flowers that framed my youth, watching in awe as the raindrops ran onto my face, joining the mini constellations that framed my lashes. I laughed at the rain the thundered onto the ground, blissfully unaware of my presence that intruded in its tranquillity. To me, the best part of the storm was the freshness that it left behind, the way it cleansed the ground my tiny wet feet played and danced upon, and the way it made the air that carried the sounds of laughter cleaner and careless. The smell of petrichor that greeted me the morning I stepped into the pristine rays and morning dew, after my dreams of flowing water, and the soft touches of petals that floated gracefully from cherry trees.

One thing I always remember asking questioningly was why storms were named after people. Now I wonder what could have happened if I kept my mindless thoughts to myself and instead went back to dreams of tall, swaying flowers and the sound of heavy rain that lulled me to sleep.However life didn't grant me that luxury, the rain was reduced to a drizzle and the flowers wilted, vibrant colours turning bleak and monotone.

I was much older when the storm crashed into my life, bringing its terror with it.

His name was Jeon Jungkook.

 When when I first met him, he carried the smell of heavy rain, and reminded me of dancing flowers, tiny footprints and innocent thoughts. He reminded me of the petals that fell to the earth, stuck in their own destructive cycles. 

It never occurred to me that while he could see through me like mist, but I was looking into a dark thundercloud.

They say the best quality of humans is their ability to persevere and weather a storm, some daring the look it in the eye. I guess in that aspect, the universe forgot about me.

When he was blown into my life, I learnt the destruction that a storm can cause.

I  cursed the smell of petrichor and the sight of flowers that danced gracefully with the person that I had simultaneously grown to love and despise, that in my dreams, danced to a song that only they could seemingly hear, composed of floating petals that sailed to the ground and raindrops the drummed onto leaves, thrumming with a tune I could only wish to hear.

Soon, I'd begun to hate my dreams more than stepping outside with wet shoes and seeing the destruction that lay around me, that everyone could see but me, and smelling that damned petrichor in the air, that mocked me, by seeming to hum the same tune that span around in my dreams.

They say you never know what you had until you've lost it. That, I can confirm, and when the storm had cleared, I could finally see that the excited tracks of a child had transformed into desolate, lonely wonderings.

Manipulation is a strange feeling, you know what's happening, but you wish not to. You hear the rain, but when you look,you can only see the sun blinding you. I didn't realise the face that once glowed with happiness, was beaten by the harsh wind, and now glowered with pain, I also didn't realise that the face I gazed upon, was my own.

Sometimes I want to find my adolescence again, and warn it to run in the midst of a storm, I want to tell myself that the rain ceases, the flowers wilt, the petals stop floating the the ground. 

I want to warn myself that some clouds are so black, you cannot see underneath them, where anything may lay.

I wish that I could tell myself as a child, why we hide from storms.",2,1

As brought up [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/a1ez2a/big_hit_new_boy_group_will_have_a_different/eap8nsl/), the news about BigHit's upcoming boy group are at an odd place on this subreddit. It's technically not related to BTS, but it *is* interesting for the subreddit's userbase and generates discussion tangentially related to BTS. The group also doesn't have their own subreddit yet, as their name hasn't been revealed.

For these reasons we will continue to **allow major news about this group on /r/bangtan** for now. In the meantime, **we have added the """" flair** for this content. (It reads *dongsaeng sonyeondan*.)

**If you don't wish to see news about BigHit's new boy group on this subreddit, you can filter this flair out.**

* On desktop you can do this with the [Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) extension](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/). Go to RES settings console -&gt; Subreddits -&gt; filteReddit -&gt; Flair -&gt; Add filter ``
* On mobile you can find this setting on most competent 3rd party apps. See our recommendations [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/mobileapp).

We'll start redirecting this content into the group's own subreddit when it can be created. Thanks!",28,1

* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""** and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

1209,2018-11-30,2018,11,30,4,a1klhf,How do you feel about this new group?,bhishma-pitamah,1543520386,"There have been a lot of discussion going on about this topic on multiple platforms from twitter to OH so I was curious about our reddit army feel about this. I have seen a lot of different perspective about this topic from people being really happy to people being wary, nervous and conflicted (of course it's not the group's fault or even about the group for the matter, it's seems more about how army is reacting or will react to the group and people can still be wary of how this group can and will potentially effect our fandom and BTS and I think it's a valid opinion to have too)

I just feel having an open discussion about this will help us know where we all stand about this situation and which direction  army is likely to lean on and it will also help us clear up any misconception we may have acquired about how army will act in this situation.
I don't think it's wrong to have a different opinion about this situation. I think that reddit is mature enough to have this discussion without causing any hurt feelings on any sides.

Ps- I hope it doesn't get taken down but if the mods think it's disruptive then it can't be helped.

I felt so happy knowing the lyrics I gave to him made enough impact that he would consider listen to the music. It also made me remember the first time I listened to Tomorrow with lyrics and how that song helped me.
