BTS gave hints during award shows. The same thing that happened during MAMA 2015 (that Jimin's tattoo). So, with the recent performance. What could be the meaning of this cryptic texts?",56,136

I've always wondered though as to who are the people behind these theories/concepts. Since a large part of these concepts are derived from books, movies and events, I am assuming there is a group of creative writers that BigHit has. However, why is it that we don't know a single person from this team? We know some of the music producers such as Pdogg and SlowRabbit. I read something about Lumpens for video direction and visual narration. 
But I haven't seen any credits given to the writers behind the concepts. Who conceptualises the concepts FIRST? 

What am I missing?

Ps. Maybe I don't know names, please correct me if I am wrong!

61,2017-12-2,2017,12,2,11,7gzwwv,Do you think BTS' fashion is loaned?,not_Someone_else,1512180336,"So I had a chat with a non kpop fan friend of mine two days ago, and in the chat I filled her in on some bts news and the fact that they're doing well for themselves in the states. In the middle of it I remembered the UNICEF campaign and filled her in. While going about the amount they and Big Hit will donate to the UNICEF #ENDVIOLENCE campaign, she blurted out a thought, saying 'I doubt they're paid that much to be honest.'

I was confused at first but apparently she didn't trust that bts were paid well by their agency. I told her I think they are. They've been sporting really expensive gear and clothes recently. She then smiled and said that that's the point. Companies and fashion labels lend them these stuff for them to wear in front of people as ads.

I get where she was coming from. [Red carpet fashion is one example](https://youtu.be/6MzO3X997ko), but that got me thinking. I'm not that familiar with kpop, so maybe the sentiment isn't carried there, but isn't that basically how idols gain money?

I don't have a doubt that at least *some* of the stuff we see them wearing is stuff they bought and rock, but I won't cross the possibility that a lot of it is lent from designer labels. How much of their fashion wear do you think is loaned and sponsored without it being blatantly announced like their PUMA hype?

Also, I don't know much about how this stuff is usually done, so if you want to correct some misconceptions or if you've got more info to add, feel free to do so!",86,52

However, during the video, James didn't seem shorter than any of the members. In fact, he was even matching Rapmon and the other 5'10"" members in height. BTS's shortest member is Suga, reported to be 5'9"", yet James seemed to be taller than him too.

It would also be extremely obvious if James was wearing 4 inch sole shoes. What's your take on this?

Edit 2; I forgot Euphoria

I thought that this theory was worth given an own thread, I am sorry if not!!


Alright, so the MAMA and MMA performances had quite a few (possible) hints. I did not come up with these these theories, I just found them on Twitter and wanted to share it with you guys in a summarized way. owo

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

[Full HD Version MMA performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elLjNqfmMaQ)


Despite some typos, we got the words:


&gt; 0:17 Wonder

&gt; 0:17 Euphoria
 
&gt; 0:23 Her 


&gt; 0:23 Serend[...]ipity


&gt; 0:56 Tear


&gt; 0:56 Singular[i]ty 


&gt; 2:06 Answer


&gt; 2:09 Epiphany 


&gt; 2:13 Love Yourself

and some others that are less relevant for the theory.

&amp;nbsp;

2. Remember [the ending of the Save Me MV](https://youtu.be/GZjt_sA2eso?t=3m30s)? ""Boy Meets **What**"".


3. [Highlight Reel](https://youtu.be/EHdK5U2hf4o) is called ""****"",  for ""Her"", *Love Yourself: Her*, the first mini-album of the era.


4. [Outro: Her](https://youtu.be/kJyn5toSd0A?t=1m4s) - notice the lyrics at 1:04:


&gt;   **wonder** (wonder)

&gt;   **answer** (answer)

&gt; I call you **her**, her 'cause you're my **tear**, tear

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;


***Conclusion:*** Are they the names of the future albums and concepts? Possibilities are:



&gt; : *W*ONDER - EUPHORIA

&gt; : *H*ER - SERENDIPITY

&gt; : *A*NSWER - EPIPHANY

&gt; : *T*EAR - SINGULARITY

&amp;nbsp;
/
&gt; ; *W*ONDER (Intro: Euphoria) 

&gt; ; *H*ER (Intro: Serendipity)

&gt; ; *A*NSWER (Intro: Epiphany)

&gt; ; *T*EAR (Intro: Singularity)


I also saw ""Wings, Her, Answer, Tear"".

My pick would be when J-Hopes comeback trailer ""Boy Meets Evil"" was released and BTS posted his reaction to it shortly afterwards on twitter. Hoseok looked SO proud and happy with how it turned out. It was that video (and WINGS era in general tbh) that made me realize how full of passion and life J-Hope is. The fandom calls him Sunshine Hobi for a reason, but up until that point I didn't fully grasp how fitting that name really is. It's not just because he's so cheerful and smiley, but because he radiates from within and his passion for dancing is almost bursting out of him. That's why I don't necessarily see Sunshine J-Hope on vlives and in interviews, but on stage when he's concentrated and focused on dancing, because even though he's not always necessarily smiling when dancing, he's the happiest [in these moments](https://youtu.be/b2xb7S_yuzo) (watch until end for the most rewarding smile)
And this quickly turned into a rant about why I love Hoseok so much. Oops.",134,172

I think it's possible to get the remaining 55mil in less than 14 days. Let's make a big campaign on various social media, posting a link to MIC Drop video on twitter, tumblr, etc with a hashtag - for example **#MICDrop100mil** or something like that.

Before they become huge in America, One Direction performed as Big Time Rushs opening act. While they quickly became bigger than and overshadowed BTR, the tour was a great way to get their name out there and assess their popularity with minimal risk. 

In more recent years, Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes were opening acts for Taylor Swifts Red and 1989 tours respectively and her influence and support was a factor in helping them blow up in America. 

Being an opening act for an established artist with a large fan base is a good way to gain attention. 

Obviously, BTS is doing fantastic on their own and opening more and more doors as they go on. Its extremely unlikely for them to be an opening act due to their popularity and schedule... but maybe playing 5 or 6 shows on a big Western artists may help them gain more mainstream attention? For example, Taylors Reputation Tour, which is playing in 50k+ capacity stadiums. 

Im ready to be destroyed in the comments, but it is a possibility, no matter how slight, that can be considered. ",51,25

173,2017-12-4,2017,12,4,20,7hgrjp,Was I the only one that noticed this?,not_Someone_else,1512387195,"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Character introduction and setting the scene arc. It's its own story, but that's the point. It's a story arc.

Wings: Character building and development. We're being introduced more to the characters. The solos served as an expression for the actors' individual characters and the short films elaborated on that by adding motifs to these characters that will be used as literary tools in the notes or recurring motifs in their cinematic work. Overall, it's a general character building arc, with a little bit of plot moving forward, but not much honestly speaking.

Love Yourself: Probably my ***FAVOURITE*** stage. Juicy, juicy oh so sweet and juicy world building. Now we're told of the character's backstory as well as more of the world they reside in. More characters come to play; Hoseok's mum (I'll use their real names here as opposed to their stage names that I normally like using, because these are the characters' names in the story), that girl following Taehyung, Seokjin's dad and a certain principle (I'm not sure if these characters will show up again or...), Jungkook's family (they made a brief appearance in a flashback. Ugh, flashbacks. I love back stories). More settings are being told to us and established. The school they spent their happy days in, the hospital Jimin ended up in after having a seizure, the sea they all had a fight in one night, the music store Jungkook and Yoongi met at after being separated, we may forget some of these settings in the future but they're there and they expand on their world. The motifs established in Wings, from both their solo song titles and the short films, make a reappearance. A piano, a lie, Hoseok's mother, they are all things established in Wings and will play their part in this chapter. Overall this chapter will include a lot of world building and the plot will move forward *a lot* (internal squealing, *squee!!!!*). This is the meatiest part of the story so far.

I'm writing this because a lot of people seem either surprised (in a good way) or confused that this chapter has the same characters and some settings from The Most Beautiful Moment in Life and some motifs from Wings. The characters never left. They were the same for two years now. The story was the same one. It was just a quasi-halt as they entered a somewhat abstract development phase in Wings. I'm writing this because I'm wondering if I'm the only one that noticed this. Also, I think this is the first time actual writers sat down and wrote stuff for them. This is the first chapter where I feel there's an actual story with *a plot*, with elements of fiction writing involved and the thing written as a an actual story (though I suspect they had the writers from the Blood Sweat and Tears Japanese version music video. That mv had way more plot than anything they released since I NEED U in my opinion).

That's not to say Big Hit planned this from the beginning. I highly doubt that ~~(willing to throw my money in the ocean if that was true)~~. They always sounded to me less of plotters and more of pantsters. It just reeked off of their work so far. You can make a cohesive story that way. It's just a bit harder the way they're doing it. Also, another reason why I think they hired actual writers just now. This is the first time I feel they have the rest of the story actually planned. It never felt that way to me before Love Yourself, but they seemed to have want to take this story more seriously now.

Am I the only one that noticed this? Lol. I don't expect everyone to think this way, but I thought that maybe some people got or thought similarly...",10,39

Yes, we like BTS. We can all relate with BTS. We often discuss about what we want BTS to achieve in the future. Maybe the vocal-line can improve on their singing. Maybe the rap-line can release a mixtape. Maybe they can release a album about this, write a song about that. Whatever. They are on the top of the world, but four years ago, they are but seven boys working hard for what they love.

Six months ago, they went to Billboard.

One year ago, they won their first daesang.

Two years ago, they had their first win.

Four years ago, they had their debut.

Five years ago, they were training everyday till their legs gave out.

Seven years ago, they were crying over their uncertain future.

And who knows how long ago, they were once inspired by someone they respected, and they said to themselves determinedly:

***""This is what I want to do, and this is what I shall do now.""***

Our boys are growing, but I want you to grow with them too.

So now the end of 2017 is near, let's focus a little less on what BTS made you feel, and instead focus on what BTS made you **do**. Write a simple reminder on what exactly inspired you. It can be a song name. It can be lyrics. It can even be a member's name, or his quote. 

And now, write what you want to do now you are inspired. **Set your goals for next year - 31/12/2018**. You can be vague, or you can be as specific as possible. It can be like RM's ""I want to perform in a venue of 15,000 people."" Or Jin's ""I want to live happier."" **Work towards that goal.** You can report back every week, or you can just leave it here until next time.

One year. Let's give ourselves one year to run before we start to fly. 

So ARMYs, what are you going to do next?

241,2017-12-6,2017,12,6,2,7hr8ju,The notion of 'I hate kpop but love only BTS',BookBindings,1512495048,"A lot of the comments under the youtube videos re BTS in the USA are some version of this comment, which I find very odd. I will just paste my response from there to illustrate my issue with such a statememt: ""Kpop is so diverse that I just don't get people who say they hate it. It isn't even a genre- it does not have any particular sound. So what exactly do you hate? Can't you say you like BTS without bringing in the whole 'I hate kpop' thing? I think it's pretty odd for someone to hate everything from, for example, Day 6, Lee Hi, Exo, Dean, Akmu, Block B, Mamamoo, NCT, Seventeen, IU etc but ONLY like BTS. That's a pretty wide spectrum of music to hate, a lot of which coincides with the style of a lot of BTS songs. One may have issues with the industry, but the music quality and hard work is pretty high for the well-known groups in general, so there is no need to try and distance BTS from kpop. They are part of the industry, and nothing about that is going to change. Sure, you may like them much better than other groups, and yes they are unique, but there are a lot of other groups that are unique in their own right.""

I feel like the people who respond encouragingly to such comments ('Yes, I also only listen to BTS, I hate kpop,' and 'You don't have to like kpop to like BTS' , etc) as harmful and misinformative. BTS IS kpop, and I don't think there is any shame in that. Rather than trying to dispel this automatic 'Generic! Manufactured! Fake!' opinion (mostly ignorant) people have of kpop, many Armies seem to rather be reinforcing this view, which i think is unfair to the many kpop groups and soloists who are so hardworking and talented.

It seems a bit cowardly to me, as though they are afraid of being judged for liking kpop and so would rather make it as though BTS is a fortuitous anomaly in the kpop scene.

Am I the only one who has noticed this? And is there perhaps a different view of such people's sentiments that I have not considered?",82,71

She's showed me a couple of videos and stuff and I just couldn't really get into it. Fast forward 2 years, BTS drop the Mic Drop Remix and I'm really impressed. I'm not a big fan of hip hop or rap music but I loved it. So I asked my friend which album I should listen to because I didn't know where to start. She said to listen to Wings because she said its their best album. 

I look up the English translation before listening to each song and damn. The lyrics on this album are fantastic. Each song is very well crafted and I loved all the solos. Not one bad song. I started watching their interviews and I love all their personalities. I'm slowly becoming a massive fan, they're all just so talented. I honestly applaud them for writing their own stuff and producing it. And writing about topics that not really a lot of boy bands talk about.

Naturally, with it, youve got a whole new group of people who can finally understand the song while theyre actually listening to it, me included (although I'm not fluent in Japanese). I know there are some other Japanese-speakers on this sub too.

I was wondering @ Japanese speakershas anyone elses perception of DNA changed now, being able to really comprehend the lyrics?


I ask because DNA now kind of creeps me the hell out. The repetition of this isnt a coincidence /  and for eternity / ..the whole song really comes off as obsessive and one-sided. 

Listening to it now, Im noticing that a whole bunch of musical elements also fit the creepy-ness really well and even enhance the uncomfortable feeling the song induces. For example, the distorted vocals, the echoing whistle (some of the vocals e.g. Taehyungs bridge section are echoey as well), some of the beep-boops peppered throughout the song, the slightly grating lalalala at the end.

tl;dr Has the Japanese ver. of the song changed your perception of it at all?",42,51

**Prices (USD)**: $13 per album, $2 per photocard, and discounts if you buy multiple. Since I'm in the US, shipping to US/CAN will be quite cheap (2-4$), but I'm willing to ship worldwide as well!

I will be updating here as things get sold or held, so please let me know! I hope my albums can find happy homes with new ARMYs!! :)

EDIT: forgot to add, I have most of the official posters for these albums as well! Let me know if you'd like those!

EDIT 2: Everything is sold! Thank you all!!",16,21

He's pretty dang good. Not that it's a competition, but he's got a cleaner and richer sound than one or two of the vocalists. He holds a note great and clearly has the stamina to dance and sing at the same time.
There is a precedent of rappers to turn rapper/vocalist, such as G-dragon, but it seems like RM has been doing more singing that J-hope recently.

For example, they release bangtan bombs, logs, RUN episodes (and Bangtan Gayo) on vlive, consistent twitter updates and do a yearly BTS festa. The 7-month wait for their comeback felt like they never disappeared. 

I ask this because I think this is probably one of the reasons why people get attached to BTS and are so loyal to BTS - they release so much content and share so much with us that we feel a connection with them? Before BTS, I've never felt ""close"" to ANY celebrity before and wanted to vote for them.

I hope that this post won't be buried by thousands of others, cause as someone who loves languages I think it is a great topic. 

So, I have been learning English and other languages for years and I always had to keep track of my improvements through language certification tests. This allowed me to have some understanding about language skills in general and now I am pretty confident in assessing other people's abilities. I am going to use the CEFR levels, and for Americans (or better: for non-Europeans) who are not familiar with them here are the explainations: 

- A1: absolute beginner

- A2: beginner level

- B1: lower intermediate

- B2: upper intermediate (**conversational proficiency**). Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOhnd5IwQO0

- C1: advanced level

- C2: mastery or proficiency (once you reached this level, you can call yourself **FLUENT**). Example (between C1 - C2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbkGuCozc9M


Disclaimer: I am not an expert English examinator, this is only based on my experience as an English learner:

- RM: Speaking C1 (coherence and cohesion B2), Listening C1. No, he is not fluent, but conversational/advanced. Edit: to be honest, he is more likely to be B2 than C1 in speaking as I consider him on my level, even though he has a wider vocabulary. He is conversational though, which is actually really good.

- Jin: Speaking A1 (not strong grammar to be assessed as A2), **Listening A1/A2**

- Suga: Speaking A1, **Listening A2** (strongest listener after RM)

- J-Hope: Speaking A1 (pronunciation is good, but no vocabulary and grammar), listening A1

- V: Speaking A1 (ok pronunciation), listening A1

- Jimin: Speaking A1, Listening A1 (he is the worst listener in BTS)

- Jungkook: Speaking A1 (together with V, best pronunciation in BTS), Listening A1


So, basically they are all absolute beginners, with Jin and Suga showing slightly better skills. What do you think?

i'm currently doing researching on the rap line for my english class and i was wondering if any of you guys could help me out~

there was a recent article posted by u/Brainiacs about BTS gaining respect in black america. it's a very interesting read and it linked two interviews namjoon did concerning AHL. i realized i know nothing about namjoon &amp; his role models and i was wondering if there was a compilation or masterlist where namjoon, yoongi, and hoseok talked about which artists have influenced their personal style/flow the most.  

i know hoseok was mostly involved in the underground dancing scene (which probably why there won't be much content of him talking about rap/hip-hop? i could be wrong), whereas both yoongi/joon were underground rappers.  

there's so much content of bts to sift through and it'd be great if you guys could help! thanks &lt;3

I loved how well it gave back the overall feeling of both the song and the mv and the starting few seconds of singing always gives me goosebumps to this day!

i'm also forever geeked out over the wings short films for each member's solo song. i think bighit did something really special with how they went artsy and out of the box for simple teasers. whenever i watch these short films i'm amazed at how instead of just simply teasing thesoundof each song, they heavily teased the atmosphereandimpression each song carried. There's a lot of ambient and other sounds mixed into snippets of chords and I like how after watching them i gota feel for them, but not exactly how they'd sound, and that made me expect them even more at the end. i'm very hard-pressed to choose favourites from this series because they all are so awesome!

For American ARMY, it occurred to me that we might be missing out on some opportunities to give BTS additional exposure. Many bars and restaurants use a jukebox system called Touch Tunes and today I discovered that the entire LYH album and the MIC Drop Remix are available on Touch Tunes. 

You can easily control the entire playlist using either the Touch Tunes app on your phone or buying credits at the machine. I know I've found many cool new artists and songs after hearing them on Touch Tunes. 

I've been adding BTS songs to the playlist for the last 30 minutes and not one person was like, ""WTF is this?!"" They just listened to it like any other song that was playing. I find that encouraging!

In every other video in the series, the pairings go Taehyung/Namjoon, Yoongi/Jungkook, and Jimin/Hoseok. But in BST, the pairings seem to be Namjoon/Jungkook, Yoongi/Jimin, &amp; Taehyung/Hoseok(?). Many scenes parallel the scenes in I Need U/Run era, but they are slightly different. Jin pulls up to a surprised Namjoon and says Long time no see.

Given what has been revealed in the Love Yourself reels &amp; the [22 HYYH notes](https://www.allkpop.com/forum/threads/bts-love-yourself-album-series-narrative-explanation-the-22-hyyh-notes.103111/page-2#post-1745873) dispersed throughout the albums, what are your **favorite theories** now about BST? Is it an alternate timeline now that there is strong evidence that time travel is involved? Is it a completely separate stand-alone storyline/concept? **What do some of its symbols mean (ie. green mist/liquid, blindfold, etc.)?** What does this mean for HER?

If they were to release an album like that, what songs would you want them to put in it?

My take:

* No More Dream
* Hip Hop lover
* Danger
* Spring Day
* Wishing on a Star (it's a Japanese single so probably not but I'll still add it)
*  Begin (it's not a bad track but it has the potential to be something more)
* House of Cards

(Trigger warning) I found this reactor yesterday called AmISam IAm (I think he might have been mentioned in a recent reaction videos discussion). He's a few months old ARMY and got sucked in via his ARMY fiance. He's super genuine and really such a fan. In one of his videos that I'll [link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iKes9ZeVQg&amp;feature=youtu.be) he talks about wanting to help the daughter of his friend who has tried to commit suicide 3 times. She's a high schooler and her mom is trying to get people to reach out and help her. He said he knows the messages BTS tries to convey with their music and he's seen people talk about how BTS has helped them. He asked if ARMYs could write comments or send emails to the girl to support her. Since it's personal information I won't post it here but you can find her name and ~~email~~ *his email* in the description of the video. *He will forward your message to the girl's mom.* I personally haven't experienced anything as dark as she has so I'm not sure I can write a proper email. I know BTS has helped a lot of people on this sub and there are people who have overcome dark times in their lives perhaps before BTS stepped into their lives. If you have time please send an email to her! Thank you &lt;3 #LoveYourself

[User vlissful on twitter highlighted](https://twitter.com/vlissfuI/status/939540152459948033) that bts had the words  (sajaegi) and  (plagiarism boys) written in the wings tour vcr which refer to hashtags that were trended in 2015 and 2016 in an attempt of defaming the boys. I think most of the fandom knew that they were aware of these hurtful actions but it still hit hard for some fans to see it like that, clear as day. I think it's pretty interesting that they included that in those vcrs that have so much to do with their own history.

**Dear BTS,**

My first memory of you is wondering why I kept seeing photo's of Yoongi everywhere. Even after when I lost interest in kpop, you kept popping up everywhere, lol. Must be a sign, since I am actually planning to get a tattoo based on Yoongi. 

My friend introduced me to you in a, looking back, very emotional month of my life. 

My relationship with my parents is not great, and I just finished 3/4 a year of intense therapy for mental issues. Just a week after I met you, I signed the contract for my first, albeit small apartment. I was in love. I remember walking through the street I was going to live in, calling my dad with tears welling up in my eyes, telling him I was doing it and how happy I was. The decision was so spontaneous, that after I signed and paid rent for the first 2 months, I had 5 in my bankaccount. But it felt SO good. I still feel good. I've been living there for almost a year, by myself, and my mental health, even though still not perfect, and I'm working on it, has not been better since I was 12. 

A few weeks later, I ended a very toxic relationship that genuinely could've harmed me. If I did this before I met you, I would've been scared. But I wasn't. I kept my head up, kept saying no and my heartbreak only lasted that evening. 
Looking back, February 2017 is probably the best month of my life. And it's all thanks to you. I broke free of so many chains, and to feel your love while I do so is just indescribable.

I love your personalities, I love your smiles, the way you can convey emotions, your enormous will to learn from past mistakes and learn about the world around you, your genuine love which is visible every time you talk about ARMY, your senses of humour, your love for each other, your forward thinking, your passion for helping others... and I could genuinely keep going. It is frustrating I cannot find a word for the absolute, raw, pure and unwavering love I feel for you. I don't exactly know how, but I want to repay you. For now, all I can do is work on myself and love myself, be kind to others and not taking anybody's shit, but I am still thinking of a way I can repay you for all the hard work you have put into making ARMYs happy. 

Thank you for being my best friends. Your music is the shoulder I cry on, your smiles are the reason I wake up a little happier each day. 

I love you, Bangtan. To the end of time and beyond. 



**Dear ARMY,**

I'm super shy and I hate jumping into conversations with people I don't know. I am currently 22, and I have seen some fandoms, but I never felt comfortable? But ARMYs, by god, you are incredible. I've never met so many pretty, funny and hardworking people as in this fandom. How Bangtan doesn't just openly melt every time they talk to you all during concerts and fanmeets is a mystery to me. If I could hug each and every one on this forum alone I would. Thanks for being so welcoming. I do not know all of you, hell, I don't even know 0,1%, but you're all my best friends. 

The first chapter has been fun, guys. Even though I was there for 1/3 of the road, I will promise you all I will be around for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th... all of the chapters. To quote Buzz Lightyear, to infinity and beyond.

PS: Feel free to join and vent if you want to. ",11,91

Every recording of it I've found on youtube has it. The BANGTANTV channel hasn't uploaded an official recording either. It makes me feel anxious most probably because I get anxious when a flash drive disconnects while I'm working. I've actually grown to anticipate the sound effect now. It's more of a psychological thing I guess.

This thread has confirmed my suspicions that I have in fact, NOT managed to watch all possible BTS content. The content is indeed endless.  Thanks for all the suggestions so far guys! Hope this has introduced some new content to everyone else too :) 


&amp;nbsp;

-----

Hello All!   

&amp;nbsp;

I became an ARMY and BTS fan right before their release of Dark &amp; Wild. As such, I sadly think that I have managed to exhaust the rabbit hole that is BTS videos/contents.  However, once in a while I surprise myself by accidentally stumbling across some ancient/obscure interview that I had never seen before so I think there's a good chance that I might be missing out on some BTS hidden gem out there.  

&amp;nbsp;  


Because I am trying to procrastinate on studying for the rest of my finals I was wondering if yall could share any obscure or hidden-gem videos/content with me?   

&amp;nbsp;  


Even if I have already seen it  I'm sure there are a lot of new and older ARMY who may not seen some of this stuff. Even if its not exactly obscure since there is just so much content out there I'm sure we would all appreciate any suggestions of what to watch! Thanks Yall :)  

&amp;nbsp;

May the collective power of ARMY help me (us all) procrastinate and discover content that we might otherwise miss!  

&amp;nbsp;

These were of course well written reviews from people who took their time to write them and I think the general consensus is that it means that bts and their music is being taken more seriously. If that's the case then as bts gains more recognition I think it's safe to assume we'll receive more reviews of this nature for their future releases.

I was thinking of the possibility of any of their older albums like Wings or The Most Beautiful Moment in Life series to get anything similar. Does this ever happen? For a major outlet to review the older works of a breakout artist?  Do you expect it to happen to bts' past discography?",4,17

I'LL ADD EDITS TO THIS POST UP HERE AS THINGS DEVELOP (older edits at the bottom, new edits at the top). PLS. SAVE THIS POST AND CHECK BACK ON IT IN A *FEW DAYS* FOR MORE INFO. THANKS! 

**Edit:** Ok so what I gathered so far from the comments is that we need to find one platform solely for the GTA ARMY. Perhaps there are little forums out there on the internet for GTA ARMYs. I know there is a group of GTA ARMYs in the BTS Amino App. But I dont have an account there so if someone here does, you can send shout outs there too. But before that i feel like we need to create one big gathering spot that we can send everyone links of, so we can gather all of us in an efficient manner. Someone posted a link to the canadian army facebook group here, thanks a lot! We can start an event page there specifically for GTA army or maybe we can make a seperate fb grp for GTA army only? I'm suggesting fb because it is more accessible functionally than a subreddit; you can make polls, put events, see who's coming/who's interested, get reminder notifications for events etc.

I like the simple idea of just meeting up for now that someone suggested below. That in itself is an activity I think lol. we can do little ice-breaker sort of games, give introductions of ourselves to each other, maybe bring BTS-related small gifts/candy for the ARMY next to us (I've heard k-armies do this in BTS concerts, its a really nice part of the fandom culture). Also eating at a nice spot is a good idea too. Just something to keep in mind is finding a place with many options due to dietary restrictions that some people might have (e.g. allergies, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher etc.). But toronto is pretty multicultural when it comes to cuisines so there's no issue there.

Pls. let me know your thoughts everyone!

**Edit:** i removed the VOD theatre viewing idea as it sounds too complicated and the comments suggest that the copyright restrictions are too high

**Edit:** So a few days ago I asked the question in one of the posts whether there was an organized group for Canadian ARMY? I'm pretty sure there might be little pockets of them present in different parts of Canada (I mean its a huge country). So if anyone knows a link or a facebook group to ARMY in the Greater Toronto Area, pls. post it here. We can contact that group and come together to do some cool ARMY-related activities and meet each other in person. If there is no such group, then we can start by making one as I got a lot of eager responds from people saying they want to make one.

As for what kind of activities we can do together, feel free to post ideas here. ",41,26

i'm in the process of picking out my senior quote and i have about fifteen tabs open of translated lyrics waiting. i've been listening to bts since their debut so this is a *very* emo time for me. i can't condense my gratitude in a couple of sentences but i'm trying to get my life on track ~~because that's what bts would want~~  

when 'agust d' came out, i was severely burned out from school and i was having panic attacks on a weekly basis. i was averaging about three/four hours of sleep a day because i was so nervous. i was in a horrible, dark place. i listened to the entire mixtape when i was doing homework and when 'so far away' came on i just started crying. you could really feel yoongi's pain with his delivery. coupled with suran's vocals and the rock guitars you're just taken to another dimension. later i looked up the translation and cried again:

&gt; dream, i will be there for your creation until the end of your life / 
&gt; dream, wherever you are, the world will welcome you / 
&gt; dream, you will fully bloom after all the hardships /
&gt; dream, though your beginnings might be humble, may the end be prosperous

yoongi's music is a safe haven for me. it feels weird to type out but honestly i find solace in yoongi's and namjoon's personal songs. 'so far away' carries this tone of yearning for better days + i love it. there was't any encouragement for me at the time so this kind of positive hopefulness stuck with me. 

i'm glad i heard this song when i did because who knows what would've happened otherwise? i'm rambling at this point but geez i am forever indebted to whatever forces brought bts together and let them make music as a group

anyways, i come back to this song whenever i'm feeling hollow inside. to know that you have someone rooting for you is a wonderful thought that i take comfort in. &lt;3

i'd love to know: which song helped you? ",68,69

An update on other projects: due to IRL issues, we have unfortunately not been able to ship off the [Jin](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7bpvs2/jin_17_birthday_project/) and [V](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7bpx8m/vs_17_birthday_project/) projects, though we hope to do so later this week. Due to this, we are extending the deadline to make a donation as our gift until 20 Dec. The charity for both projects is BTS' [LOVE MYSELF campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/), a partnership between BTS, their label, and UNICEF. 

We are a group of volunteering fans (not the subreddit's mods as some of you may have assumed), so if you would like to donate as part of the gift, or to help us cover printing and shipping costs, [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please, [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and dont forget to **add username | &lt;member name/project&gt; | cr: credit_my_donation_to_this_name in the comment box**. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations. 

Similarly, if you would like to make a donation to help us with the costs of the census book project, please follow the instructions as above. 

**We would really like to emphasize that NO financial donation or any other kind of donation is necessary to participate in this project or any of our projects.** Even though donations are appreciated, the BTSprojects team will cover the whole project costs because we really want as many people to participate as possible.

I was just listening to the Japanese version of Mic Drop, but for the first time with really good headphones. Here is Sugas Japanese verse in romaji:
&gt;Mic mic bungee

&gt;Bright light mae ni

&gt;Makekaketa kedo I'm fine, sorry

&gt;Gomenne Billboard

&gt;Gomenne Worldwide

&gt;Ninki arisugite gomenne mama

&gt;Sore ka kawari ni omae no kk

&gt;Ore no konsto de yaruze sokk

&gt;I do it, I do it, You're mazui ratatuiyu

&gt;Hara kowashitara

&gt;Kamon me~n

&gt;Sue it


In his verse, Suga is sort of doing his own echo-y adlibs. At 1:05, as he raps *kk* the echo sounds like *koko* (""here""), which is only heard in the right ear. Then as he raps *sokk* it echoes as *soko* (""there""), which can only be heard in the left ear.

It's just a little something that made me laugh when I first noticed it, because it 100% seems like something *min suga genius jjang jjang man bboong bboong* would put there on purpose. I don't know if the echoes can be understood that way in the Korean version.

Another example would be how some fans discovered that he whispers ""**s u g a**"" before he goes IN on his verse in Cypher pt.4. (which by the way, how dare he, my knees are weak)


Anybody else know of any fun little details like these?",76,98

Army can get... a bit too excited. I'm sure we can name a few incidents, and then there is the small day to day behaviour. Do you think the fan base overall needs to chill? Or that it can get a bit low-key toxic? Do you think fans need to watch each other's behaviour more?",38,22

How has BTS manage to bring us all together? Maybe you're just a casual fan who likes their music? That's okay it doesn't have to be deep! I just want to know more about the people who make up this community.**
&amp;nbsp;

There have been many individual threads discussing how BTS has inspired them, threads about being an older fan, about being a male fans, etc. In addition, the BTS census is also currently going on. So, I thought a more general thread where we can all talk in more detail about what we do, who we are, what we are interested in, and how we have all ended up here as a member of the BTS community would be interesting. 
&amp;nbsp;

Personally, I find it disheartening and unnecessary how divided/hateful the world is sometimes (stan twitter, political divides, race, etc.). So while I know there have been people who have had less than great experiences with BTS fans, I have personally found BTS and ARMY to be a very refreshing change and has managed to be inclusive without becoming a mindless echo chamber. For example, when I went to the BTS's concert earlier this year, after talking to other random fans I was genuinely surprised by the diversity. There were women, men, people of all colors, teenagers, older people, moms and dads, international exchange students, college students, a pharmacist, and some even drove or flew from across the country just to be there. This was a collection of very different people and yet every single person I talked to was just so friendly and open to talking with me, a random stranger who came to the concert alone. 
&amp;nbsp;

I think that learning about one another, who they are, what they like, and their experiences helps to build understanding and respect. Differences do not have to divide us, or turn us into ugly-hateful people. We are all human (and maybe some bots), lets be better people and be kind to one another. 
&amp;nbsp;

Remember, you never walk alone :)

Not quite sure how to start here but I wanted to reach out and see if anyone could relate to me and maybe I could get some advice. Im really nervous about posting this too, please let me know if it doesnt belong. Ive been looking for a more mature set of BTS fans to try and talk with, and I didnt quite find that on Amino. 

I only recently discovered BTS but ever since then its felt like theyve consumed my life. Ive binged their albums, music videos, and video clips like Id be tested on them. This came at a time where Id just settled into a new job that wasnt challenging me after getting a degree I hated. Im separated from my friends, Ive changed my entire routine, and BTS has been a huge solace for me lately. At the bottom of all this, I really do admire them in many ways. 

In particular, the song N.O hit me really hard because I felt like Id been a slave to my educational performance since birth. Id only ever put my passion into studies because there was so much pressure for me to go to college. I tried to dance, but my coach was so horrible to me I was forced to quit it after two years despite loving the act. 

When I saw the boys expressing their full creativity, showing off their passions in song, dance, and rap, it made me feel so completely insignificant in comparison. Were very close in age, so while I was crying over my AP exams they were training to express their favorite parts of themselves. I had a lot of envy but also a lot of regret. All this combined has put me in a major depressive state that Im having a hard time escaping. This has gone on for around a month. 

Pied Piper really messed me up too because of how trance-like my attraction to them has been, just like how they sing in the song. Its not even a physical attraction thing (although theyre all gorgeous, mind and body), its a longing to be talented and adored for my craft. Its a torturous blend of inspiration and worthlessness, and its really twisted my perfectionist personality into something really dark. 

Can anyone maybe relate? Any advice? Am I a whiny millennial? Thanks for reading. Please ignore me if I brought this sub down today. 

TL;DR I couldnt major in K-Pop Idol and Im sad I cant do body rolls, please accept me. 

EDIT: Everyone, thank you for sharing your stories and kind words. If anyone else feels like I do, I hope this thread will help them, too. ",73,184

I was kinda going for the dance style of Jungkook: solid at most things, never really makes a mistake, can dance fluidly and sharply, charismatic. Unfortunately, there are no real dance studios in my country that teach this sort of thing. I want to know what steps I should take to learn this sort of dance style, and how far I can realistically get in the two/three years I have before college.

PS: I understand that I should develop my own dance style, but watching him dance was the first real reason I've had to learn dance, it isn't very overstated or flashy, and it would be cool to dance like that. I will eventually mould this into my own dance style. ",5,28

I wanted to post this so early so people could start thinking about nominations ahead of time, so we could have more participation than in the past \^^ (and remember that the beginning of 2017 does exist!)  

Reminder: I'm holding this separate from the mod team; I'm just running this as a user this time.

Here are the categories I have so far (since there were over 30 categories last year I tried to trim it down so that it wouldn't be so overwhelming this time haha)  

*****

* BEST BANGTAN BOMB OF 2017

*****

If you aren't sure what some of these categories are for, all of them should have a description on the page of the 2016 winners :)  

The eligibility period will be from January 1, 2017 - December 31, 2017 just like last year's window. The actual nominations/voting will happen sometime in January/February (I'll try to time it for when it's a slower stream of content).  

If you have any comments/criticisms for how this will work or the categories, please let me know now so I can take them into account! Otherwise, start thinking about what you want to nominate (maybe keep a running google doc or something? ;))!  ",15,80

I heard that the CEO has posted about them before and is trying to get them to venues in Dubai and India next year. Another thing is that Paris Hilton is one of his clients and she followed BTS around the time of the AMA. This could be the link between them.

But they never show anything but a smile and gratitude. But the thing I'm wondering is all the gifts.....dude the gifts, there are so many. There is no way they can keep them all obviously, but I'm wondering where they go. Warehouse maybe? I'm sure loading up all the gifts after fan events is intense.

Its been awhile since weve made an announcement post like this, and thats because we havent really needed to make one! But recently, weve had an influx of subscribers which has caused this post to be necessary.  So, lets talk business.

***

#1. [Reddit 101: An Illustrated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6o30zu/reddit_101_an_illustrated_guide/)  

You know what Im gonna say, right? *Read the friggin guide, pal. * Its a quick and easy read and will make you up to par with how things work both on reddit and the sub. Even if youre a ~~reddit senior citizen like /u/llaverna~~ veteran Im sure youll still be able to find useful information in it.

#2. We do have rules, you know.  

*Speaking of which--* **[read them](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules)**. I swear, a large amount of the altercations or back-and-forths weve been in could have been avoided with a simple read through of the rules once.  They are there. *Read them.*

**Here are some of the most frequently not-read rules:**

&gt;**Repeat Posts:** Don't resubmit things - unless you cannot find them using the search bar. 

The search bar actually exists, by the way (ikr who knew?). Please use it. Every time the search bar is ignored global warming increases.  

&gt;**PG-13:** No porn or erotic content. This includes content that isn't explicitly sexual but includes violence or other non-PG13 things. I mean... c'mon guys. Think of the children.

Some of yall need Jesus ASAP. There are plenty of other websites to take kinky stuff to this subreddit is not one of em. Lets be respectful. I dont wanna know about the weird things youd do to X if you ever saw him. Tell that to your priest or the mailman. I dont have to know that kinda stuff, man. We also have kids here, please.

&gt;**Personal Lives:** Please respect BTS' privacy. No speculating on their personal/private lives (romantic shipping, dating, emotional/mental state etc).

The amount of projecting on members and speculation we see on their, uh, more than personal lives is astonishing and kinda creepy. We dont personally know these guys. The only thing Id ever speculate on is if theyd rather use red socks instead of grey, not if member #1 has an obsessive fear of clowns based on a 2 second clip of him saying clowns are scary. Reachin is ugly, folks.

&gt;**Personal Rants:** Please note the difference between a personal anecdote/rant and a discussion topic. Personal anecdotes belong in the stickied weekly /r/bangtan room thread, as that is its purpose. **Discussion topics ask a specific, open ended question that other users can provide answers to or a new perspective on.** The title should also **directly state the question of the discussion topic.** Anything deemed as belonging in /r/bangtan room will be removed and redirected there accordingly.  

Damn, bro. You see that bolded stuff? Hell yeah, thats the stuff we wanna see. 

Rants disguised as discussions are also bad. Youre asking for other peoples opinions on a matter, you cant just create a post with your fully formed one on it. Are you even expecting discussion or just wanting others to agree with you? Thats not really a discussion then, is it?

&gt;**Simple Questions:** Questions with a single correct answer - including enquiries about where to find a clothing item, merchandise, or the source of an image - should be posted in the weekly /r/bangtan room thread. For more details, read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6spuyb/170809_subreddit_update_new_mods_rules_and_faq/) post.  

Man you wanna make a whole post to get a yes/no answer? Is it really worth it? ...is it rude to link [to this?](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=simple+question+about+BTS) Only God knows.

Please post simple questions on our Weekly Room. Someone will see and answer you there.

#3. Titles

To expand on what we said above in personal rants: you cant start a discussion post with a title like *So, I thought of something* and expect everyone to be happy. What something? The hell you talking about? You wanna make me open that thing to figure out? Whats this, the stone age? 

Posts that only say THIS, I found this cool thing, So cute!! dont tell us anything. What this? What thing? *What are you talking about?!* Dont make me click on something I dont wanna see. Tell me what the thing is, for Gods sake!

Titles IN FULL CAPS ARE EQUALLY AS BAD. WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME? WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS? WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY. IM SENSITIVE, PLEASE. *THIS IS UGLY AND AGAINST REDDIQUETTE.*

We actually have proper [title format to be followed in Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_iii._submitting).

So, **be clear and concise**, son. If I cant know what your post is about in the title then youre doing it wrong. I have a life to live, I cant spend those extra seconds clicking on your post to read a block of text and finally figure out at the end what the hell it is that you wanna discuss about.

#4. Mods are human.  

You ever wake up at 3am on a Saturday and think: *wow I cant believe /r/bangtan mods are not robots*? Believe it or not, we are-- I mean humans, not robots. Were still on our quest for immortality. ^(If you know anything please let us know.) 

As humans, though, sometimes we make mistakes. Sometimes we have to use our best judgement to decide what to remove or not, which might not line up with someone elses judgement. When were wrong, well happily discuss with you and overturn our decision if we think youve got a point.  

You know how to ensure we wont overturn one of our decisions? 

*(DRUM ROLL)* 

##BEING RUDE TO US.  

This, amazingly enough, has never been a huge problem before. Its only been a few bad apples before this in the time Ive been a mod here. But recently theres been an uptick in this. Guess what, though: asking nicely never hurt anyone!  Were not 5-years-old. We can tell when youre being sassy.

Mods are not on a quest against you. We remove so much stuff chances are we might not even remember you. Sassing the mods as if were chasing you around and removing your posts wont help you in anything, itll just make us squint trying to remember who you are and what else we might have removed from you.

##As a reminder

Were not against criticism or anything like that. Far from it, we love hearing whatever you guys have to say and ways in which we can improve. However, being rude to us for the sake of it is not cool, man. *Not cool.* 

Just be clear and talk to us as if were human and well be glad to discuss things over with you. We might even take you out for a nice dinner if youre cool enough. Ill even introduce you to my parents.

**The short of all of this is:**

###Projects are sent with this subreddits name attached. In the off-chance someone might see this place one day, you gotta behave your ass. Dont be a toxic, embarrassing mess.  

And if you dislike that we have so many rules, there is a whole unregulated stan twitter and tumblr to roam free on. Thats what this forum would look like if we didnt have these rules. You know where to go if you fancy some drama, mess, romantic shipping and toxicity.

#5. Throwbacks 

There certainly must be a lot of new fans here, based on other platforms. This is great! New fans are cool and bring new things to the table! But sometimes, the amount of throwback posts is a bit much. I understand that everything is shiny and new, but there are a large number of us here who arent new. The Weekly /r/Bangtan Room is great for sharing discoveries like that!  

Keep checking the Weekly Room regularly to keep it successful, and to discover new things!  

***

**Now a few things for you to go and see to ensure you have a nice dandy time:**

Personally, I'd love for them to do a song that's both R&amp;B and funk, kind of like Zion.T's Babay or Primary's Question Mark. I would also love for each member to get a solo like in Wings. It's a great way to show the members' individual colors and explore new sounds without the pressure of having to be one size fits all.

783,2017-12-17,2017,12,17,21,7kdgpz,"Why BTS music is not ""K-pop"" but VERY Korean music: A Korean perspective",lagamine86,1513512416,"I've come across many posts debating whether or not BTS can be considered K-pop and many people concerned about BTS fans who weren't general K-pop fans, so as a recent Korean fan I thought I might shed light on what these terms mean to many of us and why in general we're not surprised at this. Disclaimer: I will speak in general terms and use my personal experience as a case study (ie, don't take this as scientific guide but rather a (hopefully) clarifying opinion).


First of all, it's important to understand how we (Koreans) understand the term ""K-pop"". The term is not used in Korea except for in a foreign context (eg: on the news about BTS' US performances and chart achievements). Here, pop songs sung in Korean by boy/girl groups put together by music companies are called ""idol music"" or ""idol pop"" and is generally not listened to or much respected by those older than 21-22 mainly for the reason that, to us (I'm in my 30s), it is not really Korean. Yes, the singers are (mainly) Korean and the sungs are 99% Korean, but around the mid-2000s when the government decided that idol music was going to become a competitive export, idol music companies mostly bought songs made by Western producers (Swedes, Americans, British, etc.) and just had Korean writers put Korean lyrics to them. Much of the time, these are songs that were already rejected by A-class Western pop singers (SM is an especially big sinner in this). So why would we listen to B-grade Western pop songs when we could listen to A-grade Western pop? Moreover, to us, the key criteria is not genre that determines whether it's truly Korean or not is the presence or absence of what we call ""Han"". Han has no direct translation in English but it's a mix of sorrow, nostalgia, anger, pain, and hope. It's the emotional journey and state of mind of someone who has been gravely wronged but is powerless (made powerless) in society to take revenge but decides eventually to cling to the hope of a better future when you overcome your Han. It colours Korean films, dramas, and esp our literature. And, regardless of genre, it's in all true Korean music.


And this brings me to BTS. I think the Korean general public is now fascinated with BTS because they are packaged like a typical idol group and so in the beginning most of us older than 21-22 would have dismissed them as another idol group making idol music. But then they kept defying the odds and posted incredible results in the US, and that's when the Korean general public (myself included) started wondering ""what is it that the West sees that we're not seeing? Could it be that this is not a typical idol group or their music isn't really idol music?"" It turns out, their music is extremely Korean. I sense Han in almost all their title songs but especially in Spring Day, and it's no coincidence that it's Spring Day that drew in so many Korean fans in their 30s, 40s, etc. On top of that, their personal story of struggling and finally being acknowledged in the industry is also full of Han. And this has led me (and I'm sure many others in Korea who otherwise wouldn't touch idol music/K-pop with a 12-foot pole) to realise that they are Korean artists producing true Korean music.


Therefore, I'm inclined to be in favour of the side that argues BTS is not K-pop, but I really want to have a further discussion/debate about it here and am happy to take any questions :)

Edit: Bloody hell! I did NOT expect this post to blow up like this...went to bed at 2am and just casually checking it now and I'm like O_O lol.

Think I spent about 10-15 minutes on line, gave my orders once I got in and stood on the cashier line less than 5 minutes.  All in all, was in and out in less than 30 minutes.  Which got me thinking, since it wasn't terribly difficult to purchase the items...~~

~~I am willing to help purchase any items for anyone who desperately wants BT21 products.  But keep in mind there will be additional pricing- purchasing a box large enough to ship the items and paying for the shipping and handling (and whether you want it ASAP, tracking info, etc.).  Domestic only (sorry, international ARMY!).  I will photo copy all receipts.~~

~~If it's a t-shirt or a sweatshirt, it will be easy peasy.  If it's the large cushion, it might take a bit for me to figure out how to find a box big enough.  Also, can't promise it will get there before Christmas.~~

~~The items that they have in stock are the cushions, t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodie.  The keyring and bag charm won't be in stores until Friday, 12/22.~~

~~The catch?  None.  I'm not looking to make a dollar or swindle anyone.   I'm doing this out of the kindness of my heart and 'tis the season!  The only thing I will ask is you will pay it forward.~~

**UPDATE:**

Hi! This is Linda /u/kaya_nyc and Nancy /u/kaepjiang. After the first post was made, we spoke with a Line employee on the phone and according to her, the products are in store up until Dec. 31st, they only received 800 cushions of each character on Saturday, 800 Sunday, and that THEY ARE NOT RESTOCKING ANYMORE. That means that, unfortunately, once things are sold out in store, they're gone until Line makes them available online. As of the end of the phone call, they have everything in stock except for Shooky in size 42cm so that means we're going to have to act, and act fast! Because of purchase restrictions set by Line, each person can only purchase 2 cushions, and have 10 items total. Because of this, we've decided to set limitations of up to 1 cushion (both sizes, so either (1) 30cm cushion or (1) 42cm cushion and 1 additional apparel item per person for this order. In order to keep everyone updated on the process, we're going to set up a Line chat so please don't forget to include your Line ID in the form! Because we're going to drop by the store TODAY, please fill out the form ASAP and send payment before you submit the form because we're going to close the form once we feel like there's too many requests to fulfull. PLEASE PROOFREAD YOUR FORM BEFORE YOU SUBMIT, thank you!

795,2017-12-18,2017,12,18,10,7khwrr,The BTS Bond/Camaraderie - What Does It Really Mean?,millie3,1513559957,"So I've been thinking a lot about this lately, after the myriad of questions trying to figure out how the boys made it so big. Usually, the main answers include relateable songs, knife-life choreography, communication with the fans, etc.

But there's one specific thing that has been acknowledged by everyone, even BTS themselves: **their relationship with each other.** 

I guess my question is: **how do you think the boys' recognition of this factor of their popularity will play out?**

BTS aren't the first group to be known for their bond (GG's OT9 comes to mind, and we all know how that ended up). And in general, I tend to be highly cynical and skeptical about groups that portray themselves as a family. However, I (of all skeptics) have come to believe the boys do feel genuine affection for each other. They're co-workers who have grown to become friends (maybe family) along the way. BTS are a group of people who were put together, they weren't friends who decided they loved music so much they'd create a band. They've obviously managed to find a common denominator of the love of music and/or performing. Tbh,  off the top of my head, I don't remember a group that has gone so far as to acknowledge their bond as a major reason they're popular other than BTS. 

It's made me wonder what difference this acknowledgement will make. Like, will it give members who want to leave the group or branch off eventually pause before they leave? Will the group be more candid about the reasons one member leaves if/when it happens in order to maintain the appearance of closeness they're known for? 
You know, things of that nature.

I'd love to hear y'all's opinion on this, if it makes sense.",96,77

I hope you're having a great day! Spread positivity and happyness, even in sad times like this.

Soon I will be haven a presentation in my english class and we have to analyse literature. It can be a movie/series plot, a book or even a song.

So thought of analysing a song by our 7 handsome and talented men, BTS!
Of course, it is hard topic, since 90% of the lyrics are in korean, but I do think that those translations that everybody can find on youtube or google are trustworthy! I've talked with my teacher and she said that this idea is totally fine! 

The thing is, I haven't been an ARMY for a long time... 12 months now maybe, but I haven't dug into deep lyrics yet!

This is why I have come here, to search for help from you guys!

Maybe you can recommend me a good song that is ""easy"" to analize. With ""easy"" I mean lyrics that you can understand, even if you don't know the boys, since I'll be presenting them to my class mates and my teacher, of which on 2 class mates know them!

I'm very excited for your ideas!",29,46

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJJSh-eEdRk

I feel like J-Hope is expressing the clash between youth and sin, which coincides with the main theme of the Wings album: the struggles of growing up and becoming an adult. The lyrics of Boy Meets Evil heavily connotes this paradox: ""Too bad, but it's too sweet, it's too sweet, it's too sweet"", implying that youthful love is sinful and distracts oneself from accomplishing goals as an adult. In the dance, Hobi transports between the physical and the psychical world, and deals with multiple issues in both. At the end of the dance, Hobi grows wings (A symbol of growing up, departing, and adulthood throughout the entire album) and comes to an agreement with himself that ""Its too evil, Its too evil, Its too evil, Yeah, its evil."" Throughout the entire dance he is trying to decide if the sin is ""sweet"" or ""evil"" but he finally grows up, spreads his wings, and decides that it is evil.

Boy In Luv, War of Hormone, and Danger all had major themes of being a student, young love, delinquency, petty crime, pubescence, adolescence, etc. I think it would be safe to say that these BTS eras were heavily associated with being young, dumb, in-love, naive, and reckless. As they produce more and more music, BTS has also developed, grown, and matured as adults. As they became older and wiser, so have their art. I think when it all boils down, this is the core theme of Wings/You Never Walk Alone: spreading your wings, growing up, learning, and becoming a more mature, worldly individual with the people whom you love.

WINGS TRAILER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuntXwPvvaE
The video begins with Jungkook on a swing -- Jungkook is heavily associated with the swing throughout all of the short films and music videos in the album. He is depicted swinging on it, and then the swing returns to the frame of the video, and he is no longer there. The audience is set to presume that he most likely jumped off, another piece of imagery throughout the video that is correlated with growing up and becoming an adult. I think that this scene meant that Jungkook must jump off the swing in order to become a grown-up.

Suga is displayed lying down on the grass with a broken piano and piano chair -- the piano is a symbol that Suga is heavily connected with these two items. Jimin is splayed out on the ground with a blindfold -- it is important to note that Jimin is also strongly linked to the symbol of blindness/withholding truth. J-Hope is also on the floor with arrows all around him. Many people have theorized that J-Hope is actually the angel in the story who shoots the arrows of truth to the other members, trying to inform them of the evil of youthful sin. This symbol appears in the BST music video, which I will discuss in the second part of my theory.

V is shown growing the wings of the fallen angel, while Jin is shown becoming a crumbling sculpture.

BEGIN - JUNGKOOK SHORT FILM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR73I0z5ms0

Jungkook is shown whistling (Keep this in mind for Sugas short film), and lying down in a hospital bed, having a nightmare about a piano set on fire, a car crash, and the painting of a bird. (Keep these three symbols in mind, they are all very important). He then awakens, and his voice begins singing The fifteen year old me, who didnt have anything, implying a time in which he was young. He then finds himself in a scene surrounded by multiple easels, with the symbol of the horned demon adjacent to him. He is trying to paint, but the art begins to change in ways that he does not like it, by dripping all over the place, setting on fire, etc. The painting of a bird (The one that appeared in his nightmare) shows up in his hand. Jungkook is then depicted growing wings -- a symbol of adulthood and growing up.

LIE - JIMIN SHORT FILM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y8-HD5O69g

The quote at the beginning discusses a child growing up in a familiar situation -- a comfortable household, school, and friends. Jimin is shown sitting at a table, being recorded by a camcorder. It then pans to a scene in which he is also in a hospital bed, just like Jungkook was at the beginning of his short film. He starts throwing his pillow, causing the feathers to spill out (Wings have feathers on them -- this implies that Jimin is not ready to spread his wings and become an adult). I think this means that Jimin is refusing to grow wings, and wants to stay young forever. However, the curtains around him are lifting up, exposing the darkness of the world and reminding him that he cannot be eternally young. He falls backward into a bathtub (Again, attributing to blindness and not being able to see, withholding truth), and reappears in the hospital bed. Jimin then takes a bite out of the apple, alluding to the biblical story of Adam and Eve taking a bite out of the forbidden fruit and committing the sin, because they fell for the lie the snake told them (The snake is also strongly correlated with lying, not telling the truth, and deception).

STIGMA - V SHORT FILM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i34dFsjRY4

The quote at the beginning discusses a fissure in the columns that one must destroy to become oneself. V is shown vandalizing a door, and is then arrested by policemen. This connects back to the Korean version of I Need U, when it was heavily implied that V murdered his father to protect himself and his sister. V is then interrogated by the police, and forced to recall his childhood memories. He is shown running away from some invisible force, striked, hit in the stomach, and physically beaten. The glass telephone box is flashed. A flashback is shown of him comforting his sister while his father drowns in alcohol. He sings Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry my sister while a looming cage begins to fall over him after he comforts the white dog -- a symbol of innocence and happiness that he can no longer have. At the end of the short film, he requests to make a phone call -- keep this in mind for RMs short film. The symbolism of patricide is very apparent in Greek mythology: Cronus had to kill his father Uranus in order to dominate the universe.

FIRST LOVE - SUGA SHORT FILM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VPcnJ9oJ-k

The quote at the beginning talks about how God can make us lonely, but can also lead us back to ourselves. Suga is shown walking to a music store with red lights (Symbol of the devil/satanism?), and throws a rock into the glass, the alarm beginning to go off. He sits at his piano and starts playing music, but seems to have lost inspiration (Or should I say inFIRation? -- remember when the piano was set in fire in Jungkooks nightmare?). He hears what appears to be Jungkooks whistling (Remember you heard this at the beginning of his short film). Suga is shown walking alone on a road (Think about the album title -- You Never Walk Alone: what does this mean?). A car is depicted to speed toward him and crash, but he somehow survived. He runs back to the music store (God leading him back to himself?), and an image of the bathtub from Jimins short film is shown bubbling over. The music takes on a more remorseful tone, in which Suga seems to be genuinely apologetic for his crime. He in a way, returned back to his responsibility like an adult would, and repented for his wrongdoings.

REFLECTION - RM SHORT FILM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzxjM-82RW8

The quote discusses the other side of the family/household: slaughterhouses, prisons, horses sinking to their death, murder, robbery, suicide. An ugly part of the house. It flashes to a picture of a bunker in the middle of nowhere (Remember this for J-Hopes short film). RM is shown with the painting of a bird (Just like in Jungkooks short film), and almost mocks it by tattooing himself with it, setting the painting on fire, throwing it in alcohol, drinking it, and passing out. His body begins to grow colors on it, implying that RM is beginning to become the art that he has been creating. He appears to be in a state of panic, imagery of a firework and pieces of glass/mirrors blowing up. RM then hears the sound of a telephone ringing (This is most likely V calling him from the police interrogation room). He is trying to open the chains around the glass telephone case but is unable to -- implying that no matter how hard he tries, he cannot seem to communicate and be the friend that V is desperately needing. His voice sings I wish I could love myself repeatedly.

MAMA - J-HOPE SHORT FILM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu82g0vyyTY

The quote talks about a mother being prideful and dignified about her beautiful son. J-Hope appears to be feigning illness, and is diagnosed by a physician with Munchausens Syndrome, a disorder in which the person pretends he/she is physically or mentally impaired when in actuality they are healthy. The doctor prescribes him with placebo, which is basically a small sugar pill that is given to patients for them to think that they are being treated and that their condition is being improved when in actuality nothing is happening. J-Hope is shown in a psychical state of chaos, throwing a pillow around so the feathers fall out (Wings have feathers on them -- this shows that J-Hope is not ready to spread his wings, grow up, and become an adult), paint splatters all over the walls of the bunker (The one that appeared in RMs short film). One of the paint splatters appear to be a set of wings behind J-Hopes back. This shows that he himself wants to spread wings and grow up, but somehow, his mental battles are preventing him from doing so. He is seen lying in his own mess of placebo medicine and the paint that he himself smeared all over the walls: his own mess. He was able to leave the bunker to view a beautiful painting of a forest, implying that he had the power to heal himself all along. He takes out a piece of chocolate from his pocket and smiles. The painting of the forest turns into a painting of a mother and her son, the artists name depicted to be Eva. This has heavy biblical undertones: Sinclair was comforted by a piece of chocolate by his mother during a time of distress, just like how J-Hope was fed himself a piece of Snickers, and was able to grow up and move past his juvenile mental struggles.

AWAKE - JIN SHORT FILM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYbrLlVelYk

The quote discusses a bird having to leave his egg, and must destroy a world in order to be born: the bird flies to a God by the name of Abraxas. Abraxas appears in the Greek Magical Papyri the supreme power of being transcending both God and the Devil and unites all opposites into one Being.Think back to the Greek mythology symbolism in Vs short film: V and his father mirror the story of Cronus and Uranus. V had to kill his father in order to protect his family, and face the consequences of his actions by becoming an adult. This connects back to the trailer. Jin is shown taking a polaroid of a lily, going into a room, shutting the door behind him, opening a lighter, and setting the lily on fire. He is then depicted to be hallucinating and majorly ill, looking out his window with longing at a bird being able to fly. He then touches his reflection, and seems to realize that he is in some sort of mirrored reality. The dancing lights around the room seem to connote that he is underwater. He walks past the apple, refusing to sin (This contrasts with Jimin in his short film: Jimin takes a bite out of the apple with reckless abandon, but Jin does not even acknowledge it). He walks toward the framed image of the painting of a bird (The one that appears in Jungkook and RMs short film). He begins to sing Maybe I, I can never fly like the flower petals or as if I have wings. Maybe I cant touch the sky. The video pans back to 6 polaroids on the floor of the room Jin was originally in, one showing a mirror (Reflection - RM), a mother and her son (Mama - J-Hope), an apple (Lie - Jimin) a piano (First Love - Suga), a painting of a bird (Begin - Jungkook) , and a cracked open door (Stigma - V: V was shown scratching the door).

CONCLUSION

The videos are abstract and confusing to be sure, but they are all connected in subtle ways, and they all illustrate the theme about each of the boys struggling to grow up and become adults. They face this obstacle in very different ways. For example, Jimin flat-out refuses to become an adult, by openly sinning by taking a bite out of the apple, throwing the pillow with the feathers in it all over the place, and falling backward into a bathtub -- all denoting that he is lying to himself, withholding truths from himself, and sinning. In contrast, J-Hope also throws his pillow with the feathers around and refuses to grow up by feigning illness, taking placebo medication, and having psychological conflicts, but manages to force himself out of the bunker. V and Suga all had to face the consequences of their actions, whether that was V being arrested and imprisoned, or Suga going back to the scene of the crime and expressing remorse -- all behaviors of responsible adults. Meanwhile, RM is shown also committing sin by indulging in alcohol, mocking the idea of growing up/spreading wings by the setting the picture of the painting on fire, and finding himself in a situation in which he is unable to help V. In contrast, Jungkook actually holds the painting of the bird and acknowledges it, and is able to grow wings, while Jin exalts it so highly he frames it on his wall and even refuses to commit sin by stepping over the apple, but is somehow unable to grow wings. Maybe this means that Jungkook is taking his time with growing up and becoming an adult, while Jin is trying to rush it? Maybe it denotes that people grow up at different paces? And going back to Jins quote at the beginning of his video -- arent we all similar to Abraxas in these ways? We all have the qualities of God and the qualities of the devil -- that is one makes us human beings.

Funny moments that I like (and keep on making me smile until now) are:

* When [Jungkook blew a candle with his nose](https://twitter.com/aegyotaetae/status/942518605333389313) and RM was so disgusted because Jimin still ate it

* [J-hope's reaction](https://twitter.com/vantaekim/status/941250932276260864) when Namjoon started to speak in english

* [When Jungkook cooked a glazed potato](https://twitter.com/aegyotaetae/status/943709325373124608) and it stucked to the pan (Jin's famous laugh gives me life)

* [Taehyung and Jin](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcWWsgaATha/) being too playful 

Cute moments that really made me say, ""awwww!""

* [Jin, Jungkook, Jimin](https://twitter.com/jjksloop/status/943552306372534272) hugging each other

* [Jungkook holding a fan's hand](https://twitter.com/flirtsjeon/status/943535766780686338) while he tries to calm her because she's crying",37,95

There have been smaller discussions about their public relevancy and how popular they are, but I think we need a whole post to address this, just to make sure we fill in as many people as possible and reach some sort of consensus.

Now I'm aware we can't get a completely accurate picture of this unless we live in Korea, but maybe at least piece a more accurate picture than the one we have based on the info we got.

1) The demographic stats in Naver articles for the past few months

2) [The recent Gallop Korea poll results](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7krh5n/bts_rank_at_no4_in_gallup_koreas_top_artist_poll/)

I've been hesitant about starting to do translations seriously because I think the highest demand is probably to provide fast real-time-ish translations or subs as new content pops up throughout the day and as a person with a full-time job, I can't be available for that.

The rules were slightly changed thanks to everyone's input. Hopefully the majority agrees with everything this time. The rules are as follows:

- vote for the song you would like to ***WIN***
- your account needs to have at least ***1 month of posting history*** on r/Bangtan OR at least ***20 posts done before Dec 21st*** (any comments/posts done from the 21st onwards won't count)
- don't forget to type your reddit username correctly on the form so I can check your posting history
- the poll will close on the 26th (around 10pm WET/UTC, convert to your time zone [HERE](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20171226T220000&amp;p1=133))

EDIT: because there were already double submissions less than an hour after i posted this i had to create a throwaway account. now everyone has to send it a pm for me to cross-reference users and  confirm it really is the owner of the account that is voting. click [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=whydoyallcheat&amp;subject=voting&amp;message=done) and send the message after you voted in the forms (it's already pre-filled). **if you don't send the message your vote WON'T COUNT.**

p.s. Merry Christmas :)

**EDIT 2: can you guys stop voting with fake usernames? like yeah i get it its funny whatever, but it makes it harder for me to organise the votes and im already spending so much time with this it would be cool if you guys could. you know. not make it even more time consuming than it already is**

987,2017-12-25,2017,12,25,16,7m07j9,I asked people their opinions on 10 BTS songs. Here's the data I found.,GermBurglar007,1514186340,"I got 50 people from my school to listen to a few BTS songs. This was legitimately for a math assignment, and I lost a bet, so my friend made me do it (lol). They would simply tell me which one they thought was the ""best,"" musically-wise. There was much more to the assignment than the survey (trust me, it's way more complicated than just graphing results), but nonetheless, the songs I got them to listen to included:

- Spring Day
- Danger
- DNA
- Dope
- War of Hormone
- Fire
- I Need U
- N.O.
- No More Dream
- Boy In Luv

This was just a random selection of a few songs, each coming from a few different eras. Because of the amount of songs, this took a while, but I got the survey done. Here were my results of which ones people liked the most:

    Spring Day was easily the most popular, at a staggering 14 votes.
    I Need U was 2nd, with 8 votes.
    DNA was 3rd, with 6 votes. Dope tied with it.
    War of Hormone was 4th, with 5 votes.
    Fire was 5th, with 4 votes. Boy In Luv tied with it.
    Danger was 6th, with 2 votes.
    N.O. tied for last with No More Dream, having 1 vote.

Out of interest, I then asked my BTS/K-Pop-obsessed friends/family, which equated to 32 people (close family, extended family + facebook and twitter + friends who weren't in the original sample), and here were the results of that:

    Spring Day won (AGAIN.) with 6 votes, but this time it tied with Dope. Interesting.
    I Need U was next, 4 votes, tied with Boy in Luv.
    Danger was 3rd, with 3 votes, tied with No More Dream and DNA.
    Interestingly enough, Fire, War of Hormone, and N.O. were last, with 1 vote each.

Spring Day seems to be the most popular, haha :3

That assignment's over, but now I want to pass the question to you people - out of the songs listed, which one would be your favourite? Provide reasons if you want :) I might make a followup if I get enough results. If I made a mistake in the data, that's probably because I miscounted the votes, and I'll edit it if I notice an error or inconsistency.

UPDATE: One of my friends, who was at my house, wanted to hear more of their music. I played them BST, Save Me, Mic Drop Remix, and Go Go. If you're wondering, they thought Spring Day &gt; BST &gt; Save Me &gt; I Need U &gt; Dope &gt; Go Go &gt; Danger &gt; Boy in Luv &gt; DNA &gt; Fire &gt; War of Hormone &gt; No More Dream &gt; N.O &gt; Mic Drop Remix. If you're wondering how I remembered this, I wrote it all down, haha :) As for the individual song feedback, they loved Jimin and V's parts in BST, thought the drop in Save Me was ""literal perfection,"" thought Mic Drop Remix's production was a mess, and Desiigner's part didn't fit the tone of the song, and Go Go was good if you removed the YOLO parts. I also showed them Jimin's Lie, and they got conflicted as to whether Spring Day was better than Lie or if Lie was better than Spring Day, so I guess my friend is a Jimin bias now?",50,60

But instead of focusing on EXO, I couldn't stop looking at yours truly in the corner. I remember thinking 'wow, it's really nice to see idols appreciating another artist, and they look like so much fun!'. I literally had no clue who they were and at the time I looked at multiple fancams of that moment to find out their names. After that, well I fell into the rabbit hole. Things are a bit fuzzy after that, but I think the first thing I listened to of theirs was either Save Me or Satoori rap.

&gt;**Yo, should I be a star?**  
&gt;**Baby, I think I already are**

RM starts with a line that can be interpreted in multiple ways. First, it could be taken as a person who justifies their lack of hard work by thinking they have nothing to prove. This is really common in younger generations who grow up being told that they're special, and then are cast into over-competitive worlds where they need to be even more special somehow (this is explored more later in the rap). ""Everyone is special"" is an oxymoron in itself. Otherwise, the literal interpretation is that BTS has already reached a high status; your dream can't be ""to become a star"" if you're already a star.

&gt; and Ive been driving**

After calling himself a star, he quickly clarifies that it isn't meant in a boastful way, and sets a ""ceiling"" to his talent too. This becomes important later in the rap. Then he makes his first metaphor by calling himself a car. It's interesting that he doesn't call himself an airplane or a boat or a train; he settles with the most common vehicle of transportation, a car. If the world started him, then what does that make the world? The world is represented by car keys. The one who has the car keys is the driver. The world has been steering him toward wherever it wants him to go, and RM has been following with minimal control. 

&gt; **Sometimes a man  
&gt; just cant open his car, and**

Now this line makes sense; how can you open a car without keys? When there is a disparity between what the world wants you to do and what you want to do, you might feel ""locked out"" from steering into your ideal path. It's also a nice connection that most people only get a driver's license around the age of 18, when they become an adult. Before that, it might be your car, but no one will let you have the keys.

&gt; **Aint gotta be somebody,  
&gt; be anybody  
&gt; Rather be anybody  
&gt; than live in a dead body**

Contrary to society's ""unique is better than normal"", RM focuses on this message that it's okay if you aren't special. More and more kids want fame, popularity, and recognition, but RM is saying that if the price of fame is losing your happiness, health, and stability then you're better off being ""normal"". 

&gt; **If you cant see me  
&gt; then find a helicopter  
&gt; In the night sky, shine like a star**

This sounded very proud and boastful at first, but when you take a closer look, it's the opposite. If he were a brightly-lit star, then why wouldn't you be able to see him? And if he were that high up, why would you take a helicopter to see him instead of a rocket or spacecraft? In reality, RM is admitting his own mediocrity among millions of others. He's agreeing that he's a star, but then saying he shines in the night skywhich is what every star does, hardly anything special. 

#Rap Verse 2

&gt; **Have you ever felt how hard  
&gt; it is to be an anybody  
&gt; To be living, to be breathing,  
&gt; not choosing a dead body**

RM once posted on Twitter, ""I feel that sometimes people should be respected just for being alive and existing"". He shows a lot of empathy and awareness that everyone faces their own demons. No one's life is picture-perfect. I read that every human at one point or another in their lifetime considers suicide, with varying degrees of seriousness, but it's still a thought that passes their mindRM has written about struggling with suicidal thoughts himself in the past. That choice to stay alive, it's a choice we constantly doubt and appreciate and regret. RM wrote in the mirror in the I Need U MV, ""you need to survive"", but that didn't stop five other members from hurting themselves.

&gt; **Remember, the man told me  
&gt; that this life is a party  
&gt; Yeah, all the glorys so short  
&gt; you should put away the garbages**

We don't know who the man is, but RM subtly gives credit to his seniors, and we know he must have once been on the receiving end of this advice himself. A party is ""a social gathering with entertainment"". In terms of Bangtan, ""this life"" refers to their idol life. ""Garbages"" might be scandals, or arrogance, or people that are a negative influence. Bangtan seems hyperaware of the transience of their success and they're more vocal about it than any other famous act I've seen, even when they were never a one-hit wonder. However, it's good to be conscious of that so your head isn't stuck in the clouds when an inevitable descent happens.

&gt; **Normal aint normal,  
&gt; ordinary is a luxury  
&gt; People say woo, pessimism  
&gt; why do you all on me?**

It's not normal to see normal people, so the state of being normal actually ends up being special. (If everyone is unique, then those who aren't unique... end up being the most unique.) Why? Because it's really hard to be average in our world. Happiness, for examplelots of people know how to be very sad or very happy, but the state of being moderately happy is so unmemorable that we forget to cherish those times when we feel ""ordinary"". (This might remind you of Not Today's lyrics too: We're extraordinary, that's not even that special.) 

&gt; **If you wanna understand,  
&gt; you stand under  
&gt; This sht is vital,  
&gt; respect to the mothers and fathers**

Chiasmus is a great literacy device that refers to when the order of words within a clause is switched around, and RM uses it to stress the importance of humbleness, respect, and empathy.

&gt; **Whats wrong  
&gt; with the life of a passenger  
&gt; If somebody gotta be then  
&gt; Imma be the messenger**

At the beginning, we learned that RM considered the world to be the driver of his car. But the song suggests that mediocrity is okay, and sometimes it's fine to cruise by on autopilot. You don't always need to be in control. After all, not everyone starts learning how to drive by jumping in the driver's seat and trying out their luck; some people prefer to first observe and learn from the passenger's seat. RM said in an interview that BTS tries to send messages that people need to hear, but other artists don't talk about.

&gt; **Im just too young dont know  
&gt; what to believe in  
&gt; But too young, you know,  
&gt; not to be living**  

You can live without knowing what you're doing, and that's most of the first half of our lives. You can't let your car stop driving just because you're still figuring out where to go. He also brings back a recurring lyric, and it's cool to think that without his accent, you probably wouldn't have thought of rhyming ""believe in"" with ""living"". 

&gt; **I will stay, I will wait  
&gt; and Ill fall like a king  
&gt; Even though I can forever  
&gt; ever be a king**

How does a king fall? Gracefully, honourably. Most importantly, a king is remembered even after death. RM rapped about being a king in a very different context in Cypher pt. 2, where he says ""This is a kingdom, I'm a king, you're dumb"" (in which kingdom is the music industry, and dumb rhymes with -dom)... I'm the king, I'm the god, where my emperors at?"" In this he talks about reigning like a king, but when his empire ends, he now foresees a happy ending too. But ""king"" can be subjective; whether your land is large or tiny, you're still called a king.

&gt; **I will marry this goddamn  
&gt; world by my own  
&gt; And put my self  
&gt; on the goddamn ring**

Marriage causes shared ownership. Once RM marries the world, he can take ownership of the car keys. ""On my own"" might refer to how he could lack support from family and friends, but in the end marriage only needs consent from the people involved. The second half has a dual meaning: the figurative meaning could be a grammar mistake (think of it like ""I'll put the goddamn ring on myself"" instead), and he's putting the keys into his own ignition and taking ownership of his own car. The literal meaning could be a race track ring, where he's steering himself into a situation in which even though he's competing with other cars, he can win if he puts in more effort and concentration than others.",13,81

Hi all!  

The time capsule is pretty fun to make, but if you're a super sleuth you might have noticed that the ""top posts of all time (2017)"" section isn't ~technically~ 100% accurate. This is because I have removed submissions that are not related to BTS.  

""What is this code for? Why does that need to be removed?"" you might be wondering. Well, the 2nd most upvoted post (currently) is the submission about Jonghyun's suicide. There are multiple reasons I've decided to take this submission out:

1. The time capsule is supposed to be a celebration and look back at how far BTS has come.  
2. Therefore, this post is supposed to make people feel happy and fuzzy (mostly).  
3. I'd rather not have something contained within the capsule that would trigger someone into having suicidal thoughts/depression or just generally make them have a bad day simply from reading the submission title, potentially years after the fact.  
4. Most people who seek out the capsule will not be expecting to see non-BTS related things, so it also just helps clear that clutter and keeps it more relevant.   

I also removed the post about ""Net Neutrality"" because it was the 6th most upvoted technically; I just did this to be consistent with my own rules :P  

Because of this, I will be removing any comments about Jonghyun/other irrelevant posts in the actual time capsule thread. If you have any feedback about this decision do it here (although I'm pretty set in my decision for this). I'll also be deleting this post in about 24 hours (ish. when I am able to lol)",3,42

I promised a few people on here that I would let them read the paper and that's why I am making this post. Legally, I am not allowed to share the actual paper on here as it was just for a class and my professor deemed it not necessary for us to go through the Institutional Review Board. However, I am allowed to PM it to anyone who is interested. If you are interested in reading the paper or have any questions about what I did please message me! I just ask that you DO NOT publish this paper anywhere or else I could get in real trouble! If you come across someone who is interested please have you contact me directly! (: I will try to get back to everyone asap, but it is the holidays and I am leaving to study abroad in early January so I will be busy trying to prepare for that.

I would like to thank everyone I interviewed (you know who you are!), everyone who volunteered to help (sorry I couldn't get to all of you!), everyone who expressed interest, and the moderators who allowed me to do this!

1081,2017-12-28,2017,12,28,9,7mj7lh,Why Jin and JK sound exactly like studio version while singing live - an analysis,GermBurglar007,1514422676,"So, on the Gayo Daejeon videos, a lot of people were commenting how Jin and Jungkook sounded exactly like the studio version, and I'm here to analyse why that is. I'll be looking at the MIC Drop performance mainly, since that one is the easiest to explain.

First up, let's take a look at V. In MIC Drop, he's not singing in his median range. If you didn't know, median range literally just means the middle of a singers' range. The median range basically indicates the easiest notes for a vocalist to perform, since it's usually how they speak in conversation, but with inflections and a rhythm. I put V first because he's the hardest to analyse - he's certainly not singing in his median, but instead he switches between a slightly lower pitched voice and a slightly higher pitched voice in different parts of the song. This makes it harder to perform live, as he has to deliberately adjust how he's singing. This can sometimes result in a voice crack, or sometimes' in Taehyung's case, a slightly off key line (that is usually fixed immediately after). HOWEVER, it usually just results in the vocals sounding different. Not necessarily a 'bad' different, or a 'good' one for that matter. That's the main reason Taehyung sounds so different in the live performance and in the studio version - he's not singing in his median pitch/range.

Jimin's up next. Jimin's also pretty hard for this analysis, but not too hard. Jimin is singing a tiny bit lower than his average singing voice. Jimin is an odd case - his voice isn't actually that high in speaking, but in singing, even his median is pretty high pitched. In MIC Drop, which is supposed to sound 'gritty' (I couldn't think of a better word), the vocalists are made to sing in their lower register. In the studio version, that can be fixed/hidden with reverb (and sometimes autotune, though in the ORIGINAL Mic Drop, not much autotune is used outside of Jungkook and RM's parts), but of course live, he'll sound a fair bit different, because he's not singing in his median pitch/range (this ISN'T the correct term, I'm not a musical genius, the term has just left my brain).

I'll quickly go over J-Hope too, even though he's mainly a rapper. J-Hope's voice is the most different when comparing live to studio, but he's the easiest to point out the reason. In the studio, he can sing in whatever volume he wants to, and the producers can just adjust it and normalize it in post. However, when performing live, he has to project his voice louder, like Jimin sometimes does. This results in a slightly raspy sound, again, like Jimin sometimes has. So J-Hope really has nothing to do with his range because he's not singing.

Now for Jin and Jungkook. Jin has quite a versatile range - compare his vocals in No More Dream (just an example, he has lower register parts, No More Dream is just an example) to the vocals in Awake - huge difference, because  in Awake, a lot of the song is in his falsetto. Butterfly is also a good example of the higher-register. Jungkook is definitely a good vocalist, but his range isn't amazing. Unless he's rapping, he can't lower his voice much without it cracking, and he can't switch between his lower and higher register easily (this could be a side-effect of his mild asthma). This means that he usually sings in the same pitch throughout all of his songs. That's why his voice is so stable - he's not reaching into his upper register like Jimin does (and that's why people say Jimin is UNstable, despite that not really being true), and that's also why there's not much of a difference between studio and live. Jin definitely does reach into his upper register a lot, but MIC Drop is an exception - in the studio version, he's singing spot on the median of his range, which is his stablest point, meaning minimal autotune or reverb is required. That's why he basically sounds identical in live and studio performances.

If something here doesn't make sense or you want something clarified, do ask below, English isn't my first language.

EDIT: /u/xKaillus made some great corrections, so I'm gonna post them here.


There's some things wrong with this analysis, but the biggest thing that I saw was how Jin has a versatile range and how he's singing in his tessitura (median range). Jin has an unusually small range compared to other tenors in the industry, and in the group, likely because he was recruited as an actor, not a singer. When singing with the other singers in BTS, his high notes are usually autotuned and extremely forced compared to singers whose voices are more naturally suited to the higher range like Jungkook. You can hear in Awake in the final chorus how he has to scream out the ""andwae"" and the ""I can't touch the sky"" and even in performances like MIC Drop his face scrunches up when singing high.

In recordings, his voice is the one thats usually the most autotuned out of the singers, because he's the one with the most difficulty singing high notes, and as a result he needs outside help to make do for what the song needs. In a lot of lives for certain songs where he has to reach for notes, like MIC Drop or Butterfly, he's doing his best, but the autotuned vocal track is definitely playing at a higher volume compared to the other members, and sometimes he doesn't sing at all and lipsyncs the line. In DNA as well, he often lipsyncs his high note ""ma love"" ""dalla"" while singing the rest. Jin's tessitura (median point) is actually much lower, more like where the first few intro lines of Awake are.


OP NOTE: I definitely made some errors that xKaillus fixed, so thanks for that!",72,122

These sold out very quickly and are almost impossible to find now. Sadly, living in Korea I simply have no more space in my place to keep mine and I am looking to sell my precious Suga.

In all those years I think I only took it out of the box once (to take a picture) so it is as good as new. So is the box, albeit maybe a bit dusty. I am looking for realistic offers on this please considering the rarity of it and the condition that it is on. If you are interested please DM me for information and we can discuss prices. I would recommend first have a look at what past Hip Hop Monsters have been sold for before to consider whether you would be interested in it or not.

I will also be selling this on the FB group 'Kpop to Buy and Sell' but as a BTS focused Reddit priority will go to you guys.

1145,2017-12-30,2017,12,30,4,7mwggq,"Comeback Theories - Two ""The Magic Shop"" stories.",millie3,1514575954,"Basically, it's come to my attention that the ""hints"" we were given about a magic store may have two different novels. 

The hint was:

* **The Magical Time is Coming**

* **Come to The Magic Store**

* **Now take of your mask and open your eyes.**


At first, I thought this was the story that would be the basis of the comeback, like Demian was for Wings and Omelas was for YNWA: **Into the Magic Shop by James R. Doty**

* **Extraordinary things happen when we harness the power of both the brain and the heart**

* Growing up in the high desert of California, Jim Doty was poor, with an alcoholic father and a mother chronically depressed and paralyzed by a stroke. Today he is the director of the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE) at Stanford University, of which the Dalai Lama is a founding benefactor. But back then his life was at a dead end until at twelve he wandered into a magic shop looking for a plastic thumb. Instead he met Ruth, a woman who taught him a series of exercises to ease his own suffering and manifest his greatest desires. Her final mandate was that he keep his heart open and teach these techniques to others. She gave him his first glimpse of the unique relationship between the brain and the heart.

* Doty would go on to put Ruths practices to work with extraordinary resultspower and wealth that he could only imagine as a twelve-year-old, riding his orange Sting-Ray bike. But he neglects Ruths most important lesson, to keep his heart open, with disastrous resultsuntil he has the opportunity to make a spectacular charitable contribution that will virtually ruin him. Part memoir, part science, part inspiration, and part practical instruction, **Into the Magic Shop shows us how we can fundamentally change our lives by first changing our brains and our hearts.** [Source](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733658-into-the-magic-shop)

But then, this novel/story was brought to my attention: **The Magic Shop by H.G. Wells**

* Out for a walk in London one day, Gip and his father happen upon a magic shop. At Gip's urging, the two go in  and things grow more and more curious by the minute. Counters, store fixtures, and mirrors seem to move around the room, and the shopkeeper is most mysterious of all. Gip is thrilled by all he sees, and his father is at first amused, but when things become stranger and sinister father is **no longer sure where reality ends and illusion begins.**. [Source](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1477274.The_Magic_Shop)

I feel like the second one might fit better with the highlight reel  and the stuff about putting on and taking off masks.

1180,2017-12-31,2017,12,31,4,7n3h6p,"On the book ""Life Lessons"" &amp; the Love Yourself concept",velvetfield,1514661994,"A couple of weeks ago [Yoongi was spotted](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7kjd8v/yoongi_spotted_holding_life_lessons_by_elisabeth/) carrying the book ""Life Lessons: Two Experts on Death and Dying Teach Us About the Mysteries of Life and Living"" at the airport. I'm about two-thirds through it, and I've [**uploaded my book here (x)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10c63LSQh_CYViohpltV0ctRbN3jlSwLD/view?usp=sharing) in case anyone else wants to give it a read.

There's no way to know whether or not it was a ""hint"" per say, but there's a *lot* in this book that ties into the themes of LY:Her. I thought I'd share some quotes. (These are all from the chapter on love and the chapter on relationships.)

&gt; **One would assume that if you are loved by so many, you would love yourself.** But this is not always true. It's not true for most of us. I've seen it in hundreds of lives and deaths, and now I see it in myself. Love has to come from within, if it is to come at all. And I'm still not there. 
***
&gt;**How can we learn to love ourselves?** It's one of our biggest challenges, it's so difficult to do. (...) We can begin by nurturing our souls, and having compassion for ourselves.() Most of us are easier on other people then we are on ourselves. Let's practice being as kind to and forgiving of ourselves as we are to others.
***
&gt; Loving ourselves is receiving the love that is
always around us. To love ourselves is to
remove all barriers. **It's difficult to see the
barriers we erect around ourselves, but they're
there, and they play into all our relationships.**

***
&gt; **There's no such thing as an insignificant or
accidental relationship.** Every meeting,
encounter, or exchange, with everyone from a
spouse to an anonymous telephone operator,
no matter how brief or profound, how positive,
neutral, or painful, is meaningful. And in
the grand scheme of things, every relationship
is potentially important, for even the
most trivial encounter with a passing stranger
can teach us a great deal about ourselves.
Every person we encounter holds the possibility
of sending us to happiness, to a loving
place in the mind, or to a place of struggle and
unhappiness. They all have the possibility of
bringing us great love and great relationships
where we least expect to find them. 

***
&gt; **We're subtly taught that until we find that someone special, we are just half a shell, part of a puzzle seeking completion.** Fairy-tale thinking is magical, fun, and has its place. But too much lets us off the hook, relieving us of the responsibility of making ourselves happier or better, of handling problems with our careers or families, of dealing with all the other problems of life. Instead, it lets us believe that wholeness, completeness, and solutions will spring from someone special. 

***
&gt; The search for wholeness in someone to love is based in the concept that we're not enough, we're not complete, we can't generate our own love, we can't create our own happiness in our personal, social, and work lives. The real answer lies in ending the search and completing ourselves. **Instead of trying to find someone to love, let's make ourselves more worthy of being loved.**

These quotes were pulled from the first three chapters: **Authenticity, Love, and Relationships**. After that comes Loss, Power, Guilt, Time, Fear, and Anger. Then comes Play, Patience, Surrender, Forgiveness, and Happiness.

1184,2017-12-31,2017,12,31,7,7n4o0w,Would BTS ever make an MV that isn't part of the era storyline/theme?,musicalpets,1514674030,"Hi y'all. I'm obsessed with Go Go and have seen every performance of it, which got me thinking. It's a political satire/commentary on personal finance and such, but it's a goofy sounding song that just has so many ~layers~. Its most popular performance has nearly [50 million views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YpVt43Aqvk). Admittedly it has a Halloween dance practice video with 26+ million, which is also fun to watch.

But BTS has so many other ""fun"" performance songs like 21st Century Girl and Boyz with Fun, , so I was wondering what your guys' thoughts were- if they really would ever have a legit, fun MV (thinking Big Bang style) or if the songs are fun because of their shows (lol @Tae and Suga in [this amazing performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0J26eCipr8) although their [Halloween version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tUumjx2BWw&amp;t=83s) is also amazing)

On the other side, they also have heavier songs like Spine Breaker and Baepsae (Silver Spoon), the latter of which got a great[ dance practice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPM7uIuB2Gs) that also has 
a lot of connected meaning to the lyrics like nearly all their songs. The MVs could have plot lines in the MVs that show both sides of the lyrics- the literal ones, and the metaphorical ones (and could apply to Go Go as well).

And on another other side (is this a triangle?) they got cheesy stuff like ""Coffee"" and ""Like"" that appeals to the more idol-y side of them (lol srry Suga). This is pretty straightforward, so I won't expand on that, but could also deviate from their usual stuff.

Do you consider the dance practices as their own ""music videos"" for the songs? For Go Go, it's been so popular I'm sure if the similar thing had happened to a Western artist they would embrace the chance of releasing it as a single, or in the Kpop world, a music video and has so much room for creative expression. And Baepsae was, for many people, a top song as well. But do the dance practices and performances do them creative justice? And as a follow up question- do you feel like the eras sometimes box them and their music into a maintained image?",18,39
