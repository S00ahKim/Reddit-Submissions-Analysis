I hang around on a lot of kpop forums (/r/kpop, onehallyu, allkpop etc.) and as soon as their achievements are brought up people try to hide them under the rug and brush them off. It's very rare for boy groups to chart like this, it's even rare for some girlgroups. People seem to be moving their standards of success whenever BTS hits a milestone. Tbh some people are acting as if groups need a Gee level national hit to be considered successful when their faves don't have that or can't even chart in the top 20 for more than a day or two. 

Why do you think people can't accept BTS' current success (especially) domestically (but also) internationally and why do people hold them to different standards? If we say (hypothetically) that a Gee level hit is necessary to be considered successful and relevant, do you think BTS will ever achieve that or anything close to it? What do you think is stopping them from having done so as of now and what do you think BigHit/BTS needs to focus on to get a digimon hit?

Sorry if I sound bitter or if these kinds of rants/discussions aren't allowed, I'm just really fed up with the double standards. Mods, do feel free to remove this if i'm breaking any rules (:",54,69,False,self,,,,,

This applies not only to BTS but successful Kpop groups in general. Western artists have fans all over the world but they're rarely asked whether they'll specifically release songs for those markets, and most don't. I personally would feel completely content if BTS only ever focused on making Korean music, especially as its their mother tongue and the emotions/feelings in their lyrics are best conveyed in that language, imo.  Maybe I'm reading into it too much, but sometimes there's this undercurrent of doing phenomenally well in the Asian market still not being ""as good"" as breaking into the Western scene. I've noticed that Namjoon always gets a little bit hesitant when asked this question. Of course if BTS came to a point where they wanted to release an English song, by all means, they should do it. But I hope the industry doesn't force them to do something they're not ready for/don't want to do. What your guys' thoughts?",19,52,False,self,,,,,

But yesterday I read the english subs to all the skit tracks and to my surprise...they are truly hidden and underrated tracks.

The members talk about real life stuff that they're going through like not wanting to set expectations because they don't want to be disappointed, if their title track would do well, if they're happy where they are now, what were their dreams growing up, and etc.

Skipping these tracks would be doing a disservice to their whole existence.

I love all their music, but especially all the songs with really nice rap parts (who am I kidding, it's literally every BTS song that has rap in it). Songs that I especially like are Intro: What am I to you, Intro: HYYH, and all the Cyphers.

The only problem is that I can't sing along. I'm the type of person who enjoys music especially when I spit fire along with Suga or J-Hope or RapMon while I act like I'm some hardcore rapper and do those weird hand movement things that rappers do. But since I barely know any Korean and can't make out what the rap line is even saying, it makes me a little sad and I can't enjoy the song as much.

So my question is, do you know of any rappers who rap in English that have music similar in style to that of BTS?",19,20,False,self,,,,,

So, to clarify- I've mentioned many times in this sub that I created [a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Songs4Namjoon) solely to freak out about Namjoon, mostly to myself (I don't have that many followers, lmao), but also to painstakingly recommend music to him at fairly regular intervals that I think he'd like. One thing to know about me is that this is probably one of the purest forms of showing my affection for someone. Like, if I mine through new and old songs and artists just to find something that I think would vibe with you, that means you're fucking special to me. 

Anyway, I've been doing this since mid-2016, but I never ever thought I'd ever see him recommend a track or album that I tweeted to him even though I not-so-secretly yearned for it, lol. 

That brings us to yesterday, and somehow I *completely* missed seeing his tweet until 20 minutes ago, lol. 

So what had happened was: I tweet on 4/3/17 at 1:14am EST [this](http://imgur.com/a/PIPSI). You guys might remember that we had a thread where we talked about songs we wanted to recommend to the boys/Namjoon and [I said I would recommend this song!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5zwwjs/rbangtan_playlist/df1tq36/)

Later that same day, at 4:04pm EST, Namjoon tweets [this](http://imgur.com/a/5OctW)

Eh?? EHHHH??? Lol. 

Honestly, it's just amazing, if nothing else, that we continue to have super similar tastes in music. I realized after finally succumbing and listening to Drake's ""More Life"" playlist (because he **just**. **won't**. **stop**. **mentioning**. **it**), it featured a bunch of artists I had recommended to Namjoon months and months ago, including Jorja Smith, Hiatus Kaiyote, and Skepta. 

TL;DR: I love Namjoon so goddamn much. ",35,76,False,self,,,,,

I first heard BTS back when War of Hormone was just released, 2014. At the time, they were still growing as musicians and building their fanbase--I can't even remember if ARMY was a thing yet--and weren't a big deal. I stopped listening to k-pop and after a while picked it up again when I heard BS&amp;T. This was two weeks ago. 

Since then I've been listening to all their music, watching all the MVs, dance practices, BANGTAN BOMBS, award ceremonies, and going through their twitter and ig, seeing just how much they've grown in the time that I wasn't looking (in the meantime falling in love with Suga, haha). Even though I'm a couple years younger, I feel like a noona!

Anyway, these past few years since 2014 have been an emotional rollercoaster. Trying to get over depression, family issues, school, to work hard without motivation, and make worth out of myself when nothing feels like it's going well. Listening to AgustD's mixtape hurt my heart[eu] and made me sob since I relate to it (I'm sure a lot of us do) like nothing else. I guess that's probably why I'm so attached to Yoongi! Other songs that hit hard were Save Me, MAMA, Fire, and The Lost. Now I listen to them everyday basically non-stop; I may be addicted, but I've never felt so happy.

I love how unconventional Bangtan can be, from their personalities and funny behavior to their music, especially their lyrics. Every member is their own person and nothing can restrict them from being themselves. Without their strange combination of daddy Namjoon's smarts, kind momma Jin, grandpa Yoongi's swaeg, Jimin the sexy ~~perverted~~ flirt, Taehyung's faces, and Jungkook the golden maknae, BTS wouldn't be Bangtan Sonyeondan. Agreed? :)

For a while now, I've been trying to get to my goal weight. It's only a few lbs, yet it feels like a ton. After picking up Bangtan again, I came up with an idea to motivate myself so I can finally hit that goal. I made Yoongi's beautiful legs my goal and drew [this](http://imgur.com/a/955Q5) on my arm (a little smeared). Some people have even asked if it's a tattoo, hehe

Looking back, I guess I'm part of the veteran ARMY, so maybe I am a noona in a way (haha). Thanks to ARMY for the unconditional support for our boys, because their growth to this point has saved me. They deserve you and you deserve them completely.

Thanks for reading my word vomit. Hope you like my fake-tat. #yoongigoals",6,32,False,self,,,,,

Google Translated below:
&gt;In the future, the Military Manpower Administration will be responsible for the performance of domestic entertainers' military service. 

&gt;The MMA sent an official letter to a number of management companies in Korea earlier this month. 

&gt;For the contents of the official letter, it is a request to cooperate with the list of the entertainers under the revision of the Military Service Law. The public has been interested in whether or not to implement military service of social leaders and interested classes (entertainers and athletes), and has been managing the implementation of high-ranking public officials and their children's faithful military service to spread the fair military culture. According to the amendment, the scope has expanded to popular culture artists and athletes. 

&gt;A man born between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1999 is required to complete and submit the personal information of his / her artist, including the contracted trainee. Popular culture artists mentioned by the MMA are singers, actors, comedians, dancers, performers, DJs, models, voice actors, musical actors, performing artists, and other broadcasters. 

&gt;Recently, the issue of enlistment of some entertainers was topic of society as a whole. Since I enlisted later than the average time I have been doing activities, the noise that I had was not always stopped. In particular, Yoo Seung-jun abandoned his Korean nationality in January 2002, became a citizen of the United States, was exempted from military service, and was unable to enter Korea due to immigration prohibition under the Immigration Control Act of the Ministry of Justice. So far, lawsuits are continuing. This social interest is directly managed by the Military Manpower Administration to manage the performance of entertainers' military service. 

&gt;An official of the Military Manpower Administration said on the 5th day of the sports day, ""Management of the official site was against a company registered with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism."" ",32,33,False,self,,,,,

I mean, I get that other races don't know what tends to be offensive to another race. I get that. 

My issue is is that the internet is here, it's uncommon to pull wearing headdresses and Indigenous motif as an accessory without knowing the historical sacrifices my people have had to make to retain those customs and for it to be ignored. 

I mean, it's enough that I feel invisible in my own country, but all over the world? Like people like me are just a myth, a relic? 

I don't see this as a sign of appreciation at all. Appreciating my culture would mean speaking up about issues that threaten the beliefs of my people. Appreciating my culture would mean learning about contemporary artists like Frank Waln, A Tribe Called Red, and others. Appreciation would be speaking up when my people go through what they did during the #NoDAPL protests in the winter. 

All of those feathers and headdresses mean something, and it /really/ hurts when I see some of my favorite idols like Park Jimin and Kim Heechul disrespect the history behind those items. 

This may have already been addressed in an earlier convo, but I really got into KPOP a little under a month ago. 

I am conflicted. 

**** I love Park Jimin, and I love Koreans. I am saying this because I believe he can learn, and grow, I wouldn't have loved BTS for as long as I have if I didn't have faith in who Jimin is as a person. I know he's a good person; he's simply unaware, and by no fault of his own. 

Edit: Emphasis on I love Jimin. 

Also, I found out about them in late March of this year, and the incident I'm talking about is from 2014. It really seems like he's learned. But it was new to me, though. ",25,0,False,self,,,,,

Quite often said is that BTS, strangely, is felt like it is a new group rather than 5-year-old one. Many groups at this time after debut lose their drive and disband or seek for solo activities around 4~5 years into their activity. But BTS seems to be only extending their horizon with new freshness. Especially with recent US concerts and publicity, I started to dream a little more about BTS. I think their peak is still to come, at least not this year. What do you think? Internationally do you think they can grow more and how much? 

+) Here is a long rambling about BTS and BigHit, if you forgive me.
One of the reasons that I believe they will more grow is the way BigHit works now. They are so smart in arranging everything. Last year, despite BS&amp;T's huge success, They did not send BTS into variety programs just to grab the momentum of BS&amp;T as many other entertainment companies would have done. They are focusing on music and do not make our boys mocked or consumed in easy way. The balanced schedule of private and public life of BTS, the wise interaction between BigHit staff choreographer and producers with other domestic and international artists, how they interact with fans with such delicacy in the way I feel like I am being invited and respected by this company etc etc, all only contribute to making fans enjoy BTS music relatively care-free. 

Another reason of believing that BTS has more room to grow is the smartness of BTS members. I followed another top group for a long time, but I never felt this level of professionalism as artists from them. Namjoon: Not only that his lyrics does shock me everytime with such genuinity.  His quality as the leader of the group is cannot be praised enough. He knows what the team should focus on and what not as we see his comments before they go up concert stages, he always pin-points what fans want and what not. And he has such tender mind toward young members while he is brave enough to challenge himself with all the featuring suggestions. Jhope/Jin--again, I have followed idols for so long, but I have never seen such kind and golden mind hyungs. From Korean standard, Jhope and Jin are such generous and humble hyungs. The more I know them, the more I wonder how all these hyungs in BTS can be so so  (=nice, good, kind, good intended, etc etc)! In many cases in Korea, hyungs are rulers and dongsaengs are kinda the ruled. Suga, with his own characteristic and musicality, has his own aura and he just makes BTS so much more high quality in music. Dongsaeng lines- Jimin's growth in music and dance makes me feel that he will never stop growing, and he will represent some spirit of BTS sometime soon; he does have something fierce! V, with his natural idol charm, with his beauty both on face and body, has been and will remain the central attractiveness of this group. JK, with all the changes he has shown with his growth and with his talents, will also contribute to this group even more in the future. 

In sum, in my opinion, this group and the company are both so smart and charming that they might open a new window for Kpop. (maybe already). Sorry for randomly long thoughts. ",26,88,False,self,,,,,

This is a game to determine which MV we like best. All you have to do is
#vote for the MV you like the least.
Whichever MV gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

Choosing which MVs get to participate in this survivor was hard... I didn't want this survivor to be excessively long, but I also didn't want to take out too many MVs. I ended making my decision by taking into account what you all commented on the previous survivor thread and also what I think is best.

So, without further ado, the MVs which will get to participate in this survivor are **the korean + japanese discography MVs for title tracks and b-sides** (this means no mixtape MVs, intros, wings short films, etc). Also, **only the ""original"" version of each MV will be counted** (this means no dance versions or any other alternate versions (e.g. facial expression version of Just One Day)). And even after taking out all of these MVs, there's still a lot left... this is gonna be the longest survivor we've had until now!

I hope you all agree with the criteria I chose! **If most of you don't agree with it or think these are still way too many MVs then we can always redo the first round on Thursday.**

They definitely have the time available in their tour schedule if they're invited. Which I would think they should be because they're nominated. But the ultimate question is... will they be performing? It seems like a long shot because they're only nominated for one award and there are so many more artists who are more well known in the US who will likely be performing.

But now I present my case to you all for how BTS could possibly perform at the awards show. 

For the past two years the Billboard Music Awards have had a performance sponsored by Kia called the ""One to Watch."" It's purpose is to ""support and highlight emerging artists."" In 2015 Tori Kelly performed before she had released her first album. And then in 2016 the performance was by Troye Sivan. Both of their stories that were highlighted in the articles/video packages were that of artists starting online and then crossing over into ""mainstream/major label"" artists. 

If BTS were to get the 2017 Kia's One to Watch title their story could be about emerging in the US market without a major label or any formal debut. As far as I can tell, that haven't picked the artist for 2017 yet... But I also can't really tell if they're still doing it in 2017. I know this is still a really big long shot to hope for, but it could give us some hope that it may happen. Just because Billboard has this history of having not super well know/mainstream artists perform at the awards show. 

And also, if you believe in signs or whatever Tori Kelly and Troye Sivan... both artists that members of BTS like and have covered songs from... COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT... I mean, yeah probs. But hey, it's cool to think about.

EDIT: I guess I should also mention that Tori Kelly and Troye Sivan were both signed to major US labels at the time that this happened and BTS isn't. So that may be another reason to think why this won't happen.

ALSO, I am somewhat intoxicated right now... so if this doesn't make ANY sense then feel free to ignore and move on.",11,60,False,self,,,,,

She wasn't a full ARMY when this happened, but she liked the Wings album and she knows all of their hits (because of me, no shame) so I'm still going to call this a fan account because she learned very quickly what it was like to be in our fandom! 

She let me share this account because it was an opportunity that I unfortunately decided to pass up so I could actually attend the concert with my close group of friends, but it really is an entertaining read!

**DAY 1**
 
ya girl hit the fangirl jackpot and got to perform with BTS. keep reading to find out how it went down

okay but like actually today was fucking amazing and i didnt really expect it to be?????

like fuck dude i woke up this morning wishing i were with my girlfriend but settling instead for some dank league of legends while i ate breakfast and watched boku no hero academia with my sister as she procrastinated getting ready for the BTS concert she was going to tonight (4/1)

and so as i was laying on her bed with her she got a phone call from her musician friend Albert (sleightlymusical on youtube, shameless plug). he was calling cause he was playing violin for the BTS concert as part of a string quartet but one of their musicians a violist had to drop out last minute cause he had some personal problems so they needed a string player asap and Albert called Arlene cause she was the only violinist he knew well who lived in the area

so Arlene was fucking torn because she wanted to watch the concert with her friends but she also wanted to play and she realized i was right next to her and she was like  do YOU want to play for the BTS concert?

and i was like uh sure

and she said okay well we gotta be there at 1 so go get ready

and i was like wtf dude its 12:30 what am i supposed to wear i havent showERED OR ANYTHING FUCK MY LIFE

so we hauled ass to the venue where Albert met up with us and gave me a staff pass and we went down to the room where the other two string players were waiting and they were like DUDE YOU JUST SAVED OUR ASSES okay heres the deal we arent actually playing were basically stage props but heres the music and yeah

so we spent about an hour trying to figure out what the fuck we were doing and then we got called onstage for rehearsal and i was like fuCK IM NOT READY FOR THIS

when we got out there they were rehearsing Begin and holy shit jungkook was sO FUCKING CLOSE and all the other members were just sitting onstage and scrolling through their phones but holy shit they were so close to me and i was lowkey fangirling on stage

and then jimin went on with Lie and he was rehearsing and he botched the high note and just laughed it off and i laughed with him becuase fuCK ME hes so cute and if a cute boy laughs you know im fucking going to laugh too okay

then it was our turn and we got to accompany suga when he sang / rapped First Love which fuck my LIFE its my favorite song on the album and i was just like starstruck when i was playing because hes so beautiful and the song is so beautiful and i was just having an out of body experience like holy shit this was so surreal like aM I REALLY FUCKING HERE JUST WTF IS GOING ON like when the music started i was like huh where is he cause he wasnt onstage and then i turned around and realized that he was being ELEVATED ONSTAGE WITH A FUCKING PIANO RIGHT BEHIND ME AND I WAS FREAKING OUT like the entire itme i was playing i was just trying not to obviously stare at him but hes just fucking gorgeous and i love the song and holy shit dude i was just having the time of my life and like some of the members were sitting literally RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME on the stage as we were playing and i was like internally hyperventilating

and when we played for Jins Awake we had no idea what we were doing either but i was also just staring at him like a shameless fangirl but i had to tone it down cause im a fucking professional yanno but when he leaves the stage he crosses literally RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME so i was just staring at him wide-eyed as he walked right past me and i just died inside

but yeah we had no idea what we were doing during the rehearsal so afterwards we went back to our room and figured out some shit and then got lunch (they had catering backstage for the staff) and then took a nap and i realized i was still sweaty and greasy cause i hadnt showered that morning so i went home and showered and came back within an hour and a half cause thats how close i live to the venue and honestly the only reason why it took more than an hour was cause i was checking with people constantly to make sure i could get back in after i left and i kept getting lost and shit but anyway i came back in time for dinner and guess who was in the fucking dining room with us

B T S

im a terrible fangirl so i couldnt tell who exactly was sitting with us but i think it was J-Hope, Jimin, and V????? i think??????? but they were eating in the same room as me so i was honestly hella fucking starstruck

like legit i walked in and while i was getting food i think i was next to Jimin as he was getting tteokbokgi and i looked at him and was like huh he looks familiar and it wasnt until i sat down with the other string players and they were like omg i cant believe theyre actually eating with the crew like how down to earth and i was like huh and then i looked over and i was like FUCK I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO JIMIN and i had literally walked right past them all to get some water and i was so close and i was just like H O L Y S H I T im fucking dead goodbye someone kill me now im dead i can die happy right now

we werent allowed to take pictures backstage, and especially of the BTS members, for safety reasons cause BTS had received death threats so it was important that their locations arent compromised (which is also why i have to wait until after the second concert is over to post this) but i was honestly so fucking starstruck i just went back to the room and sat there in awe
one of the other string players (not Albert) was sort of mocking the fans he saw outside? like he was like lmao theyre like taking pictures of posters and shit and i was hella judging him like why u gotta be like that let them enjoy themselves you arrogant piece of shit and also he was like im gonna be so sick of this song when we were trying to figure out what to do for First Love and im just like listen here you little shit this is a fine ass piece of music and so help me god you are going to stop being an arrogant piece of shit and he was just so condescending???? like ????? i dont want to play into stereotypes but he goes to USC for a masters in violin and like ???????????? i get that youre good but do you need to be such an ass???

anyway we sort of chilled as the concert started and i decided i wanted to listen to them so i hung out backstage and listened to the opening number (Not Today) and i was jamming backstage and since no one was talking to me i decided to push my luck and ultimately ended up in the wing as i waited for my cue but i got to see them perform up close and it was so surreal hearing all the screams

and after they finished Dope they all ran riGHT FUCKING PAST ME as they headed to the changing tent and i was fucking starstruck and then i fucking went on and

I

T

it was fucking CROWDED like i knew it was going to be a full house but it didnt really register to me that it was going to be a crowd of 18,000 people???? like holy shit???? it was just a sea of dark faces and lightsticks and i was like holy crap this is amazing because it just looks like a starry sky and my sister was in the crowd really close to the front and i saw her and she waved at me and i waved back and i was like O H M Y G O D IM ACTUALLY DOING THIS and then the music started and i was just amazed as i played and watched the crowd and i was like wow this is so nice like this is such an amazing feeling and Suga was so cute and holy crap i was so close to him and i was just staring at him the entire time like I AM CLOSER THAN THE AVERAGE FAN WILL EVER BE IN THEIR LIFETIME HOLY FUCK

and then as soon as it started it was over and we were being rushed offstage and i wanted to stick around and watch but i got kicked off the wings and then out of the backstage area but i came back around Stigma and i was just U G H and i got to play for Awake, Jins solo, and that one is cool because the platforms move up and down so it was pretty fun on that one but it was funny because i was sitting next to the cellist and instead of going around the cellists endpin Jin just took this giant ass step over it and he walked literally RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME like he was trying to fucking walk past me to get to a seat in a lecture hall and i was just melting inside but i had to keep my cool because im a professional yanno

but yeah after that we got kicked out of the backstage area again but as we were leaving the stage i looked to my left and saw Jungkook practicing some choreography and he made eye contact with me and fUCKING BOWED TO ME AND I BOWED BACK AND I WAS JUST LIKE ?????? HOLY FUCK?????? DID I ACTUALLY??? JUST???? BOW?????? TO JUNGKOOK????????????????

im literally dead

but anyway after that we split up and albert and i went to try to figure out if we could watch the rest of the concert and we ran into two girls (Hannah and Loomy) and they showed us a good view but then we ended up leaving early cause we didnt want to get stuck in all the car traffic in the parking lot so we left

and honestly im home right now and typing this and i feel so fucking starstruck like h o l y s h i t that was amazing

and i get to do it again tomorrow

and im getting PAID

im fucking getting PAID to have the experience of a LIFETIME

i got to perform for 18,000 people

i got to share a stage with BTS

and im fucking getting PAID TO DO THIS

F U C K M E U P

**DAY 2**
 
OKAY TODAY WAS PRETTY FUCKING AWESOME TOO

i got to the venue around 4:30 and wasnt expecting to do too much. we went to the dining room around 5:30 and ate dinner and as we were finishing up, V, Jungkook, and i think Rapmon walked in and started getting food :O :O :O :O

i got up to throw away my trash and i walked past jungkook who knocked the tongs over in one of the catering trays and without thinking i reached over and picked it up and i realized i was HELLA FUCKING CLOSE TO HIM and my first thought was shit im gonna get fired cause were not allowed to talk to them or interact with them but i just sat there and enjoyed being in their presence 

i was talking to my friend and she was asking about what they were doing and as i was telling her what was happening they walked out and V ran back over to the food to grab a couple of pieces of shrimp tempura before running back out LMAO

anyway we were just chilling the entire time until the concert started and we were called up for standby and when i tried to walk up the stairs the stage manager on my side ran down and was like NO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT SONG

like jesus christ dude

the stage manager likes to just tell me no all the time fuck

anyway we were waiting there and jungkook was singing Begin and i was like omg i just want to cheer him on cause not gonna lie i was super happy that he bowed to me yesterday so i said WHOOO JUNGKOOK as he passed me on his way down the stairs and the stage manager came by and was like please act like you dont know them backstage and i was like well fuck i thought i was gonna be drowned out by the fans cheering but nope apparently not

anyway during First Love i was super happy because Suga was performing so well and i was lowkey tearing up and just enjoying the moment

i escorted myself off the stage after that cause i didnt want any more confrontation from the stage manager lmao but when we came back into the wings to get ready for Awake there was a camera and none other than jungkook was messing around by the stairs just waiting and warming up and i was like aaaaaaaah im so close to him

and then he decided to go uP THE FUCKING STAIRS TO WHERE I WAS

HE LITERALLY WAS LIKE THREE FEET FROM ME

AND I WAS LIKE TRYING SO HARD NOT TO SCREAM BECAUSE F U C K M E U P HE WAS RIGHT THERE

another stage manager came by and told us to wait for his signal and that caught jungkooks attention and he turned and saw us and bowed to us again and my heart fuCKING MELTED
like shit man i didnt really have a bias before this but i can safely say that jungkook is now my baby

anyway we got onstage for Awake and after the performance was over Jin walked in front of me and i followed him offstage, only he forgot which way to go and i ended up bumping into his security guard as he came and fetched Jin and escorted him off the stage

after that we asked if we could stay and watched the concert but the producer told us no :-( which sucks but i got to live the fucking dream dude im just happy that i got this experience

and i got paid to do it

In fact, during reporting period of March 18, 2016 through March 16, 2017, BTS was on the chart for 20 weeks and No. 1 for 15 weeks. ^[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Social_50_number-one_artists) Justin Bieber is the only artist with more No. 1 (23 weeks) than BTS during that period. There is no doubt that BTS deserves the 'Top Social Artist' nomination fair and square. 

However, I found out something interesting about the nominated category that I wanted to share with y'all. If you, like me, did some smart googling, you'll find that from [2015-2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Music_Award_for_Chart_Achievement), Chart Achievement Award was the only fan-voted award, and from [2013](http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/bbma-2014/1562898/justin-bieber-chosen-by-fans-as-winner-of-first-ever-milestone)-[2014](http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/bbma-2014/6029451/milestone-award-finalists-2014-billboard-music-awards), Milestone Award was the only fan-voted award. I couldn't find any fan-voted awards from 2011-2012. On the contrary, since 2011, the Top Social Artist award had been determined by Billboard without fan votes. Why did Billboard decide to change it up this year and open the category to fan voting? If it was awarded by chart history, it looks like Bieber would win again. But with the notable difference of BTS among the nominees, is it possible that the change happened because of BTS? It's weird because I can't think of other reasons why they would change it (imo).

Note: Considering Asian Junkie's recent post and what I discovered, let's have a civil and open discussion about fan voting for BBMAs. The crowd at this sub is usually more matured so I'd like to hear your thoughts.",12,22,False,self,,,,,

Naturally, I immediately started looking a little more deeply into the moves to find out what they were trying to say at any given point in the choreography (using the [lyrics](https://ilyricsbuzz.com/2017/02/bts-spring-day.html) as context). This is what I found:

*the links are to screenshots, not the actual video*

* [0:06](https://ibb.co/kv5K35) Jimin and J-Hope reaching out for each other over a barrier. *Note that this formation looks very similar to the one from [3:17 to 3:34](https://ibb.co/iMQ0bQ) where Jin reaches out to a solitary V.*

* [0:16](https://ibb.co/bu7z35) J-Hope is reaching out to Jimin, who he was separated from at 0:06 after the barrier disappears. 

* [0:17](https://ibb.co/e5hAAk) ""*Miss you*"" The members pass by and Jimin disappears, leaving J-Hope reaching for someone who is no longer there.

* [1:51](https://ibb.co/dQGywQ) ""*Passing by the edge of the cold winter until the days of the spring, until the days of the flower blossoms*"" J-Hope is at the center of a ""flower"" that blooms.

* [2:17](https://ibb.co/e2JBGQ) ""*Yes I hate you, you left me*"" Suga is separated from Jimin by a wall.

* [2:34](https://ibb.co/kiarGQ) ""*I'll say that I'll erase you*"" Jimin runs away from the members.

* [2:40](https://ibb.co/h7tiVk) ""*...but I can't really let you go yet*"" Jimin rejoins the members as they resume their synchronized choreography. *Note that they do this throughout the videoone member does something by themselves but then they snap back together into a cohesive unit.*

* [3:30](https://ibb.co/cVoiVk) Jin comes out from inside the formation to go to V, who had been crouching alone. **The other members seem to be in a formation (also seen at 0:06 and 3:25) resembling the prow of a ship.**

* [4:28](https://ibb.co/cJJvbQ) The members pass by once more, this time to reveal Jimin so that Jin can ""*come for him*,"" who had been waiting.

* [4:35](https://ibb.co/cSnAAk) The unspoken lyric (expressed through dance) following the last line, ""*Please stay, please stay there a little longer*,"" when Jin finally reaches Jimin who had been separated from the members until now (see [0:06](https://ibb.co/kv5K35) and [2:17](https://ibb.co/e2JBGQ)). *Note that Jin is also the one who reaches V at [3:30](https://ibb.co/cVoiVk).*

The part I bolded is where I'm unsure of what to make of the choreography. Considering how [many](https://byeoltan.tumblr.com/post/157313625223/did-you-know) people [believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tye1ONFeKis) that the song and its music video are a homage to the Sewol Ferry tragedy, it's very possible that the formation does represent the prow of a ship. Still, I don't have any context to make this assumption so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to what, if anything at all, the formation could represent.

What do y'all think? Has anyone noticed anything else?

*p.s. I really should be asleep right now and I have no idea why I just spent so much time on this when I have to wake up early for work tomorrow. Stanning BTS really is a serious commitment...*

This is a game to determine which MV we like best. All you have to do is
#vote for the MV you like the least.
Whichever MV gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds.

In the end I decided to redo this round, because even though there were people who wanted to keep the japanese MVs, the ones who wanted to redo got more upvotes. And besides, we can always have a japanese MV survivor after this one ends!

But last night I had an awesome Bangtan dream and I wanted to share. But then I also wanted to here about others dreams too!

So I had a dream that I had gone back to the states and was flying back to Korea with my sister. So we went inside a dressing room at the airport (???) and found a cap and a little yellow journal that we had seen V using before in a video clip (I don't think I have ever seen him with a baseball cap and a yellow journal, but it felt real in the dream.) and we were like ""OMG this is V's!"" So we kept it, and I wore the cap and carried the journal around the airport. 

Then during our layover in Disney World (?????) - again, dream - I started feeling guilty about stealing V's cap and journal and went to a customer service table and said ""I have a delivery for someone but I don't know who it is..."" And they said ""Oh just keep walking around until they see you and they'll take it from you."" (Baaaaad customer service lol).

But then I heard in the distance someone whisper in Korean ""Ah I think it's a delivery for me?"" (Side note I've been having a few dreams where people have been speaking Korean and I understand. Good sign that I'm studying well!) 

I looked over and it was V whispering to pink haired Jimin. And he was sitting amongst all of BTS so I deliberately walked past them so he would see the journal and he actually caught up to me!

He tried speaking in super fast Korean so I wouldn't understand and kept gesturing to the hat but I said to him in Korean ""I understand what your saying, but I don't think this is your hat..."" And we just had a normal convo in Korean and English that ended in ""What's your Kakao talk?"" 

And he said ""Oh I can't give you....""

And I said ""Woww what are you a celebrity or something?"" (Pretending that I didn't, but knowing full well he is a celebrity.)

And it ended in us exchanging emails, him leaving, me still having the hat and journal, and me also DYING on the inside from having had a full convo with V and playing it so cool.

The rest of the dream went on a tangent and I didn't get to meet V again. But it felt so real!!!!

If I ever met them IRL I would pretend so hard that I didn't know them. If they were chillin in Gangnam, I would go up and ask them where the best food in the area is, acting like I don't know their birthdays and heights and favorite colors ().

If I did that, I could probably have a longer conversation with them and thank them for their help in a very American way with a handshake. I think if in a normal life situation I recognized them, they'd be worried about SNS and attracting other people and causing fandamonium.

At a fan meeting or something I would totally tell them. But in a normal life situation... ARMY? What's that? BTS? You mean behind the scenes? ;)

(These are the things I think about although I'm sure they will never happen )

EDIT: I should clarify, this is just supposed to be a fun, hypothetical post, sharing your dream meeting BTS situation. I think most of us would prefer to let Bangtan have time to themselves if we saw them in public. This post is not meant to be serious. Just fun.

Personally, I normally watch my UB's fancam. Sometimes some of my biases (I have one UB and 3 biases. I don't know If I can do this, but I do anyway). I watch the others members' fancams If I got magnetized with one in specific when I watched the group performance. But, in reality, I'm not so into fancams so sometimes I don't even finish to see my UB's lol

In general, I tend to click on my UB's fancam. Sometimes some of the others and sometimes I watch all of them If I think that everyone suited the concept. Sometimes ~~like, often~~ I just don't watch none.

Also, I know that the views say about their popularity etc, but I don't feel like I have to watch all of them for show my support. I never felt the ""obligation"" to this so I was wondering about you. I don't think it means that I don't stan all of them how people tends to think It means.

So I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5swzkc/rap_monster_book_recommendations_as_well_as_a/) a while back and you all gave me some great recommendations so I decided to compile/review/discuss some of the books I've read these past few months, and I'm also hoping for some more recommendations!

As you all know, RM has a very philosophical approach to music, his life, and his dreams. I can see a lot of Nietzsche influence which is strange since my favourite authors are Murakami and Nietzsche too, but his understanding of them seems to be much deeper than my own. Someone asked a while back what they hoped the next BTS theme to be and a lot of people said hip-hop and things like that but personally, I'd like to see a bit more surrealism! The philosophical approaches in HYYH/Wings were absolutely mesmerizing so I want to see what he can do with themes that Murakami frequently shows in his works. Surrealism, escapism, existentialism... I know some people don't like the complicatedness of their works but I am personally a *huge* fan because the depth of their works is really important in influencing young adults/kids during an age of technology where you can just 'search up answers to life'. BTS has brought in some great questions and thought and I definitely wouldn't mind seeing more of it.

Despite all my praise for BTS, I'm a pretty critical person, and BTS doesn't get special treatment just because they're my favourites either. Blood, Sweat, Tears, though it's art in its own right, felt like a slap to the face. Everything was so compact and complicated, I remember being stressed every time I watched their solos and the BST MV. I know most people watch it because ~~they're hot~~ it's just fun to watch, but I'm not exactly the type of person that can sit around not knowing. The moment I heard 'Demian', I ran to the nearest bookstore to get myself a copy. I love how complicated and deep everything it, yet I hate it at the same time because who really knows what these people are thinking? Who the *fuck* reads Nietzsche and goes 'Ah... that's a good theme for a movie about bodily fluids' (ofc I'm kidding). The point is, even with my previous love and knowledge for literature, I can't even scrape the surface of what RM and BTS has done with their music, and their MV's. Every time one theory seems to fit with another, a different piece is either missing or remains. But I think that's also reflective of the philosophical branch--the more you try to answer, the more questions it will raise thereafter. Ultimately, it's the individual that chooses how to interpret their music.

-MURAKAMI: happens to be my favourite author of all time. I grabbed 1Q84 when I was 15 and remember hating myself because it seemed like a waste of time. It was a big 'what the fuck' moment for me when I realized I had read a 1000 paged book without knowing/understanding anything that was going on. I hated him for a few months before stumbling across more of his works. Note: read Kafka on the Shore and Norwegian Wood before tackling 1Q84 if you've never read Murakami or the surrealism genre he often ventures through. There are many 'wtf' moments, but many incredibly refreshing ones too. There's something so pretty about the way he writes--they're not really stories that make you think like Nietzsche, or are plot rich like Game of Thrones, but there's a gentle and harsh elegance that's often balanced by many subtle moments in his stories. He's really a hit or miss from what I've seen and I only started enjoying his works after I entered university but it's definitely worth a shot.

-NIETZSCHE: as John Oliver once stated, 'Youre shit, were shit, everythings shit. Never try for a better world, because it doesnt exist.', except the second part doesn't really count because Nietzsche talks a lot about #YOLO (I wish I was kidding). Sound strange yet? Welcome to philosophy! This is, of course, all up to debate too, but Nietzsche really holds a lot of important questions that will really make you question everything in life. It's horrible, but I use Nietzsche to fuel my depression sometimes (wow, and I wonder why I'm always sad) and I don't recommend it for 'new' philosophers, but everyone does seem to take his works a bit differently so I guess it really depends on who you are. But reading Nietzsche's works kind of tugged at my heart because some of his desperation, his questions, and existentialistic POV's really reflects well with RapMon and Suga. I love RM but sometimes I feel that he's a little cold (I'm not saying he's mean or uncaring but rather, geniuses always tend to have that vibe because they understand things ordinary people will never bother to think about) but a lot of that warmth and hurt is well-portrayed by Suga. Or maybe that's just because he has a special place in my heart as a #1 bias. Either way, Nietzsche is always a splendid read for me and I don't regret it at all. I highly recommend Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Human, all too Human, and Beyond Good and Evil (which I think are like his top three works anyways).

-LE GUIN: I had a huge 'wtf' moment with 'The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas' because I went to go find the book the day Spring Day MV came out, only to no avail. I went to the last Indigo I could think of which was really far away and found, to my delight, that they had 1 copy in stock. I searched the entire store but I couldn't find it. Later on, I realized that it was stuck between a collection of Le Guin's short stories, but the entire book was $30. I was super late for class and I liked Le Guin's previous works anyways (Tales from Earthsea, anyone?), so I just grabbed it and ran. Well let me just tell you--they weren't kidding when Wikipedia described it as 'a plotless, short, descriptive work of philosophical fiction'. It's literally six pages of 'Hi fam! Welcome to Omelas! We're a fucked up society where we lock a child to fuel our happiness, and some of us are aware, some of us are not, and some of us decide to leave but we have no idea where the hell they're going or why they're leaving!'. And I'm not kidding, that's exactly it. There's no explanation, no further discussion, it's literally something Le Guin wrote as in 'hmm, this seems like an interesting idea. Okay, let's no longer expand on it and publish it as an idea. But in all seriousness, I really liked it--I'm a fan of dystopian novels and this had the sombre tone to it, despite it only being six pages long. Frustrating, yes, but I know I would've read it for sure if it was an entire story.

I'll stop talking here because this is way too long to be on the internet and I'm sure I've bored everyone by now, but if you have any more recommendations, please let me know! I'm also a huge fan of medical books (currently reading 'Do No Harm' by Marsh and 'The Emperor of all Maladies' by Mukherjee, as well as Atul Gawande's works) but I'm pretty open as long as it's not classical (i.e: Shakespeare). And feel free to discuss some works with me too! Exams are over and I'm just going to be reading nonstop anyways, so a good conversation could do me good!",42,84,False,self,,,,,

As your friendly neighborhood sub wiki lover, I have come to inform you of some cool new pages I've added to the wiki, as well as spotlighting some old pages I want to make sure everyone knows about!  

You can access the wiki at any time by going to www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki or by hovering over ""Main"" at the top menu bar of the sub, and clicking ""wiki"" from the dropdown. **Reminder that any person with over 250 karma in this subreddit is able to add/edit a wiki page!**  

#New stuff:  

* [Birthday thread compilations archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/birthdays)  

I took the time to crawl back through the search history of this subreddit to compile all the old birthday threads we have here, since they're so great and cute to look back on later.  

* [Sub layout archives](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/layouts) 

Since the sub themes over the years have been so cool, I tried to compile all of the old ones we've had here! Take a trip down memory lane, or just go see what other layouts we've had over the almost 2 years!  

#Cool stuff  

Now, I encourage you to look at [all of the wiki pages](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index) - cause there's some really nice stuff there that I've worked hard to make - but here are some of the most useful/cool that everyone should absolutely look at:  

* [Audio](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/audio)  

This page will almost CERTAINLY include a song BTS has made that you've never heard of before (unless you've looked at this page before). I highly suggest it, whether you're an old or new fan (but especially for new fans).  

* [Related Websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/websites)  

I have tried to make this be a masterlist of the best accounts to keep up-to-date with BTS. It also lists a bunch of different translators, so take a look to see if there's any new ones you might want to follow for more updates!  

* [V App Broadcast Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/vapp) / [Variety Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/variety)  

These are pretty self-explanatory.  

* [WINGS Tour Megathread archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/wingstour)

What I like most:
- Bang PD allow members to follow their own musical direction
- Bang PD doesn't allow antis to hurt Bangtan feelings
- The members fight and make up, they get along fine. I'm so glad to see that outside of the celebrity world, they are still just boys hanging out together. Through these fights, they can learn how to better solve problems. 
- Jin personality is still the same as predebut, with the other members growing into their current personality
- WHAT HAPPEN WHEN THEY DRANK!?

I wanted to know how people intend to categorize the group's eras as they grow and whether you think group's intent, as articulated by Bang PD, to just tell their story in a way that would reach people has changed as they become more popular. 

I ask because I came across certain comments yesterday complaining about how they got tired of BTS's ""concept"" of youth and suicide (yes, they really did say that) and how overrated they found the group because their ""sound changed"" after INU and how they've lost their ""musical identity"" and how it's ""sad that artists capable of writing their own lyrics and songs have sold out like this.""

TBH, when I saw these comments , I immediately got confused because there was so much I found perplexing about such statements. And quite honestly, these comments come across as casual BTS listeners who base their assumptions and opinions of the group on their title tracks only. I am willing to agree that their title tracks do follow the latest trends but since this is intentional (as stated by the group members themselves and now Bang PD), I see nothing wrong with making music that appeals to the current popular trends. It's called Kpop after all.

So I made this thread intending to have an honest discussion about whether those people have a leg to stand on regarding such a subjective issue as a group's intent to use a particular platform to tell their own personal stories.

TL; dr:

1. Does BTS's recent sounds (Wings, HYYH Pt.1 and 2) make you feel like they have changed their ""concept"" after becoming popular?

2. Do people who base their opinions solely on a group's title track have the ability to make assumptions on a group's concept? In other words, how determinative are title tracks of a group to the whole overall presentation to the GP?

3. Do you think the ""youth"" concept has overstayed its welcome? Or are you one of those who see that the ""youth"" concept will never be completely over because ""youth"" is not just embodied in one phase.

4. Are you overall satisfied with how BTS is using the kpop platform to tell their stories even as they appeal to popular trends?

5. How would you characterize BTS's concepts in light of the fact that the group was meant to showcase their growth through music as they do, in fact, grow?

5. Finally, how much time do you think they should spend showing the phases of their growth in order to not overstay the welcome of any one phase?

What would happen if BTS and Justin have distinctly similar sounding songs?

I have standing tickets closest to the stage and I wan't to know the basics about the pit... Is it crowded? Do people push? How long will you have to stand in line for you to be able to stand in the front? Out of your experience how many people line up early?

I'm new to reddit, so I'm very sorry if I'm breaking any rules or am not supposed to post this here.

I am planning to go to Japan in June and I really want to go to a BTS concert there. I'd like to go to one of the Saitama concerts and I have a few questions. Most importantly: is there anyone living in Japan (preferably Tokyo) who could help me get the tickets, please? I'd prefer to avoid middleman services to save money, and as someone living overseas it's pretty much impossible to buy tickets directly as far as I know. So it would be very nice if someone could buy the tickets for me, if it's not too much trouble. 

I know that the seats are assigned randomly. Do people who buy the tickets from general sale usually get worse seats than the ones who get the tickets through the fanclub lottery, or does it purely depend on your luck? Should I try finding someone who'd get me a ticket when they go on sale for general public, or is it better to buy one of the fanclub tickets on ticket.co.jp?

Speaking of resellers, how risky is it to buy tickets from them? I've heard that at some concerts the staff checks the ID at the entrance. Is this the case at the BTS concerts? 

Also, I saw that bighit had a website where you could pre-order ARMY bombs in Japan. Will they still sell them at the venue? Do ARMY bombs usually sell out fast at the venue or do they normally have enough in stock? 

Sorry for asking so many questions. Answers to any of them would be very appreciated! I really want to see BTS live and I'm very anxious because I don't want to miss out just because I don't know how to get tickets, especially since they're highly unlikely to come to Europe anytime soon",15,7,False,self,,,,,

Some personal thoughts!: 

* I was surprised by how much I liked V's playlist and its chill + happy vibe - he's the last member I thought I'd have music taste in common with! 
*  RM's list is great to listen to both as background music and when you want something interesting musically to listen to - something that's hard to do with a playlist
* Jungkook's 'sad yearning vibe' in his playlist surprised me, even given the songs he covers. Made me feel like if he did art, he'd make romantic scenes with hazy pastel colors
* I loved how 'curated' and focused Suga's playlist was on one genre
* The series made me wonder what Korean artists they listen to, especially since the only member who included Korean songs was Jin (with BTS songs). I have a feeling it would be less Top-40s focused for some members, but who knows.",36,35,False,self,,,,,

This speech is from Kim Chul Hwee, the director of VB Studios, the team behind the WINGS Logo.  He and his company has done a lot of work for other kpop groups and talks about a few of projects throughout the speech.  BTS' part starts from the 9:50 minute mark.   

To paraphrase, Bang PD wanted something simple but impactful so Kim noticed that there hasn't been the use of the dot in many kpop logos so he started with that in mind.  He also looked at the Hanja word for wings  and deconstructed it and saw four dots and so that's how the foundations for the Wings logo was birthed.  And then he goes on to say that for this logo, he could go on for hours and there's a lot of stories behind it but ends up moving on to the next logo they created.

I'd like to know if they're following the venue seating plan in the link I included-minus the seats behind the stage-~~(Edit: lol why wouldn't they tbh)~~ or if they modified it a bit.

I have seats in a single letter row and I'm wondering if people were given seats in those rows just so I have a better idea of where my seats are :) ~~cough actually, it's because I thought my seats were closer to the stage so I'll be a bit upset if it turns out that my seats are further away than I thought lol~~
