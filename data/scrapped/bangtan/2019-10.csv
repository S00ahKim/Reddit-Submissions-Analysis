Incluso las superestrellas del K-Pop tienen que participar en el servicio militar obligatorio en su pas de origen, que es obligatorio para los ciudadanos varones de entre 18 y 28 aos, debido a las ""tensiones con la vecina Corea del Norte"".

Las nicas excepciones son para los atletas o artistas que ganan competiciones internacionales en nombre del pas - pero estar en la banda de chicos ms activa del mundo aparentemente no cuenta.

Ninguno de los integrantes de la banda, Jungkook, Jimin, V, J-Hope, RM, Jin y Suga, tiene que servir ya, pero es probable que Jin sea llamado en cuanto cumpla 27 aitos en diciembre, ya que el servicio dura entre 18 y 22 meses.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-RCoVbwpQjK4tC26zh7I9-gplViMi-Q-Q4kykyb6hdo/edit?usp=sharing

The sheer tone deafness of this article is actually astounding. Not only do they reuse the same dragged out and tired stereotypes about manufactured industry. As if the western industry isnt machined and heavily regulated. 

It also proceeds to project this arrogant persona on to Namjoon (RM).  -We have to consider ourselves not just better [than other K-pop acts], but the best. Says RM, BTS' 25-year-old charismatic leader. -When we're out there on that stage, we're there to conquer. We think we're the ones."" 

The crocheted section [the squared brackets] signals modification to the original quote and is used to insert explanatory information by someone other than the original author of the quote (Namjoon), meaning Namjoon definitely didn't say the section in the square brackets. (explained by Matthew- ntropersona on Twitter)

Anyways, I feel like I am not getting a concrete answer from twitter and I am hearing different things, but what do you know about buying tickets from resellers. What was the Muster experience? I hear most people are looking for companion tickets but I am also encountering sellers who will pick up the bracelet and hand it to you. But I have read that BTS staff will be doing random checks for ID when you enter with your bracelet into the venue. As much as I don't want to risk it and get turned away, and waste money, but I also don't want to let up a chance where I could get into the concert.",0,1
71,2019-10-2,2019,10,2,23,dcapc2,Is anyone else over the media/industry trying to analyze BTSs success?,SongMinho,1570025341,"Because, 90% of the time, they go in with preconceived notions and will go out if their way to spin things to fit their assumptions. Or, at best, only glaze over the surface of things. Or go the shallow route, Oooh! The boys are so DREAMY!

And even the industry trying to figure out the secret to their success is getting it all wrong. Its like, OK, lets go ham on social media and watch the money and loyal fans roll in! Seriously, you cant manufacture their talent, their personal life experiences, their individual personalities or their group dynamic. Its all just a beautiful, happy accident. Or a minor miracle if you are so inclined.

Personally, BTS is best understood by just watching them and letting themselves talk. The best advertisement is watching them perform, watching their V Lives, and watching them goof around and play games and let them be their fun, goofy, sincere, intelligent and talented selves. 

Ive noticed some YouTubers who started reacting to BTS and actually paid attention to the music, the lyrics start to GET it. For example, The Reel Rejects. They only started covering BTS because one of their Patreon subscribers kept asking them to. At first they were cracking silly jokes about the whole phenomenon, but they also listened and carefully paid attention and finally realized why the boys are so popular and have such loyal fans.

Sigh....I dunno....do you think its a necessary evil to do these interviews for major magazines at this point? Because Im genuinely torn.",74,214

So we finally got TXTs comeback date: October 21st. Pre-orders and teasers have already begun.

Now that I have that date to work with, I can start piecing things together. The other vital piece of information is that BTS is coming to Los Angeles on December 6th to perform at the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball. 

I FIRMLY believe that BTS wouldnt be dragging their asses to the US (2 days after the scheduled MAMA awards) just to perform old material. They will absolutely have new stuff to premiere and promote.

So, lets do this!

From now until October 29th. 

* They have concert dates coming up, but they could also use their time to lay down the final vocal tracks before sending the songs off to get mastered. As well as, do their album photo shoots.

***October 29th***- Final Speak Yourself concert.

***October 30th***- Announce Comeback date of ***November 29th*** and begin pre-orders.

***Nov 1st***- Begin comeback rehearsals.

***Nov 23/24***- Japan Fan Meeting

***November 29th*** - Comeback! Which is also Black Friday in the US. The day after Thanksgiving and the biggest shopping day of the year. CDs sell incredibly well because they make great stocking stuffers.

***November 30th***- Melon Music Awards Comeback Stage.

***December 4th***- MAMA Awards. Probably another huge performance.

P.S. If Big Hit is smart, they will make arrangements to get the rights to put HD versions of these performances on their YouTube channel the next day. Because we know that shit would go viral.

***December 6th***- IHeartRadio Jingle Ball in Los Angeles.

***Dec 7 - 11th***- Do some US promo in Los Angeles.

***Dec 14/15***- Japan Fan Meetings

Then do End of Year Gayos until December 31st.

So what do you think!?",38,103

Not to mention their is no telling how bad their PTSD will be and there is a good chance that the scale of thier concerts is gonna change this like fire works will be a trigger really anything that remotely sounds like an explosion will be a trigger things like large crowds, loud noises, flashing lights, could also be triggers it could be years before they are even able to tour agian. Sadly their is a difference between coming back physically and coming back mentally they could all make it home safely and still be trapped there mentally. I don't know if they will be able to come back easily from this. 18 months doesn't seem like a long time but it is long enough to change someone's entire life.",1,0

119,2019-10-3,2019,10,3,19,dcozvc,My perspective on the BTS visiting Saudi Arabia issue as a person residing in that country,kuroinferuno,1570098601,"Although there's no massive uproar about the boys visiting SA (as of now), I have seen some ARMY's getting upset after reading this article from [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/02/entertainment/bts-saudi-arabia-intl-hnk-scli/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2019-10-03T04%3A52%3A05&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_source=twCNNi). I would love to share some thoughts on this issue, as the media here does piss poor job of sharing the sentiments of the country.

Many have mentioned that this concert was a result of a deal between SK and SA. With this I 100% agree. This deal is even more apparent as EXO is planned to visit somewhere around November as well. We also had a Super Junior and Stray kids concert back in July. Certain countries are also barred from visting the region. People are definitely right to be offended about this deal as Saudi Arabia doesn't exactly have a good human rights system in place. 

Despite all the negatives mentioned, this BTS concert has extreme potential in bringing postives changes to the country. Regarded by many as a PR move (and it is actually), the country has now started issuing Tourist Visas for the very first time. With a fanbase this massive, this concert will surely attract a lot of people, and to me this is a very good thing. Opening doors to global communities will affect the mindset of both the locals, and the people around the world. And this has actually affected my household. Being bound to religion, my parents (not as strict as some other households) didn't approve of me going to the concert because they have been exposed to western music, which generally contains explicit content. Showing them just two BTS songs (with subtitles on), they bought me the tickets instantly (they would have loved to accompany me if the tickets weren't that expensive). Small personal victories like mine WILL propel the country towards exposure, not of the Government, but the normal people who live here. 

English is not my first language, so many apologies in advance if my thoughts were not articulate. I sincerely hope that I managed to bring a new perspective, rather than the one produced by the media globally. Also people asking Bighit and most importantly, Namjoom to be accountable of the statements, they should realize that an official statement will only ignite the fire even more, because people always find ways to become outraged.",4,10

I think it's about how the someone else edited it with their song and the members posing shows their personality. If I'm not mistaken the order and song goes from:

J-HOPE: Hope World

JIMIN: Promise

RM: seoul

JUNGKOOK: Euphoria

JIN: Tonight

SUGA: Trivia : Seesaw

V: Winter Bear

BTS: Born Singer

I was so happy when I saw this.  I don't know why but it really cheered me up but now I couldn't find and it's driving me crazy. Thank you in advance to everyone that would be answering this!  Thank you! ",4,3

Lets keep it factual to avoid negativity so please dont talk about whether you like the song or not.

I wonder if BH was actually waiting for SM to make the first move so that everyone can assess how SuperM would brand itself. It looks like SuperM is ||embracing the Avengers theme quite literally with the superhero powers, helicopters and motorbikes. There are also a lot of black leather outfits, suits and harnesses.||

With the above in mind, do you all think BH would still go with the dark and sexy concept? I know things are planned years in advance so the comeback song has already been recorded at this point. However, I dont think they would have filmed the mv yet. 

My take: I would be shocked and delighted if a slow song like Spring Day came out. Cinematic, poignant, wistful... maybe even raw and artistic?",4,0

When I say accepting, I mean, accepting of what others like, but not necessarily being into the same thing themselves. However, turns out my love for BTS what a little difficult for them to understand, not because they're a ""boy band"" or that they're ""Korean"", no, but because it was Korean MUSIC. They're fine with k-drama because even though it's in Korean, too, it has subtitles you can read *while* you're watching it, something that wasn't possible if you wanted to listen to bts late at night, since they didn't want to look at the translations if they wanted the music to help them sleep. This was something I kind of got where it came from, but didn't really get it because I never had that issue. Anyway, I never forced them to listen to bts or watch their music videos.
What I did do, though, was make my WhatsApp status lyrics of BTS, or their quotes, and I rotated them every three days or so, or I put them as my story. Since I have my classmates on WhatsApp, too, they kept going through my stories or reading my status, and asked me where was I getting those quotes from, and my response was, ""someone profound. let me know if you like them because if you do, I'll change them more often so that you can, you know, read more."" This went on for a month or so before they four of them finally hounded me and made me tell them who it was. Imagine their SHOCK when I told them it was BTS. 
They told me they didn't know they had such meaningful lyrics (I put Tomorrow, Run, Butterfly, Spine Breaker, Home, Intro: Persona, Intro: Nevermind etc) as my status. Anyway, they asked me to recommend them some songs with similar lyrics, which I did, and a couple of days later, three of them turned up and told me that bts is such a ""different and intellectual group"" and that they're sorry they didn't get into them sooner and that they weren't going to promise that they'd become proper ARMYs, but would definitely not stop themselves from listening to them if their music called out to them.

So, it's okay if they don't become an ARMY like I am, but they respect bts, as individuals, a group and as artists and that means A LOT to me",1,3

I saw some people not be happy with a recent feature done on them, partly because they felt Namjoons words had been twisted and taken out of context when he mentioned seeing other k-pop groups as competition. My question is, why would it be bad if he saw other groups as competition, and if other k-pop groups see BTS as competition? Im guessing they all want to be on top, so wont there be some competition between groups? If theres no competition, what do you think is the reasoning behind this? Is it a cultural difference to the West where, in my experience, in most professions theres some competition (whether to get the job, get the promotion, etc)?

Im sorry if I have posted this in the wrong sub-reddit or if I shouldnt have asked. Like I said at the beginning, Ill delete this post if Im wrong to have made it.

Thank you to anyone who helps me understand ",32,41

Can we call them the ""definitely"" biggest ""band"" in the world based on their album/ concert ticket sales? Or do we have to add the word ""active""?

Objectively speaking. Cross that. Is it a fact? It's not?

I might be wrong. I don't have the numbers. I was doubting myself on another thread till Ayikorena kindly enlightened me that, yes, they are that huge.

It just annoys the heck out of me. Why can't they get their facts straight when they are in the industry. Besides, bigger talk show hosts already gave the boys all the credits (special thanks to Colbert). They should have known better. Don't get me wrong. The guy was nice when he talked about Hobi. I just heard it one too many times.

I don't even give a f about a grammy when the insiders can't accept one simple fact.

In light of all the issues exposed in vote rigging and alarming idol mistreatment from cj enm in shows such as the produce series, idol school, and now even super star k (and also maybe show me the money), what do you think will happen to the joint company? 

Do you think it'll dissolve? Or will they lie low until this scandal is done? Will the scandal even affect the joint company or cj enm? BH may not have known any of it when they signed that deal but do you think they should back out or continue as planned anyway, knowing what you know of cj enm? Or do you think this isn't really a big deal?

This is a question that just randomly came to my head. Are your parents ok with you listening to kpop? And no, I won't write here a story about how my parents are hating me for listening to BTS or kpop in general. It's pretty much the opposite. I started listening to BTS about 2 years ago, November 2017. My parents aren't those types of parents to get angry that their child likes something that they don't yada yada y'know. They are pretty chill about it, especially my dad is like a best friend of me so I knew when I tell him he'll be ok with it. I didn't really know about my mom tho. The reactions turned out better than I expected. When I told my dad and showed him some MVs he was ok and said something along the lines of: ""Do what you want, it's your music taste."" My mum was a little surprised by their looks. And said something generic that they look like girls or I don't even know by now, but she was and is okay with it now pretty much. She really doesn't like it but she doesn't hate it either. She is even happy when she see me happy when I buy an album or go to a concert. (I was on N.tic in Prague this September.) and my dad is interested to say the least. I play those CDs in car and when I asked what he thinks about it he said and I quote that he really isn't listening to it, it's like a background but it isn't tearing his ears so it's okay. He even said that LY: Tear is his favorite album or sang a little bit of Fake Love one time, he is excited with me whenever I'm opening album and everything so I see this as an absolute win. Oh boy this was long but I felt I was one of the lucky ones so I want to ask, what were your parents reactions? Have a good day, !",63,23

It would be great if big accounts would organize it. A star on the Walk Of Fame is such a prestigious emblem.

I once was a strong girl
I once had it all
Nothing around me
Could make me feel small
But when my world toppled
And fell to the ground
Your music and kindness became 
A saving sane sound 

When you said use me
I dont think you know
What your words do to me
How they give me hope
I know you are human
But my words will never reach
The world that you live in
That's so far from me
But thank you for your kindness
Your kindness to a stranger

The worst now is over
I think I can breathe
But your words and hard work
They keep inspiring me
And when I feel crazy
In my headphones I feel peace
You've helped me to find a way
To start loving me

Chorus

Millions of people in every continent
Theres something about how it reaches our souls
And maybe you'll never know, how many lives you've saved
But I know we all are grateful 
My words may never reach you but I hope that my prayers do
I wish you love, warmth and so much peace
Because you've written the songs, you've danced your hearts out for us
And you've spoken those words that mean so much to me
By the way... you're so lovely

So long story short : my friends asked me to make an app to keep track of their photo card collection, and so far i've done 70% of the core features.

What i'm missing is a complete list of released cards in a decent quality along with their set name and the card name, so i can easily (and legally) add everything to the app (which will be free of course, just in case this avoids any legal problem)
As you can see i'm not very informed on this world and i hoped  someone on this group could help me finding the missing pieces.

Also how are photocards released? Are they released (for example) with any new album? Is there a way where i can see if new cards have been released? Cause I wanted the app to be useful and updated with every new release

273,2019-10-7,2019,10,7,18,degyzu,Have kpop fans and Armys put too high of a standard on BTS and labeled them poster boys for wokeness,ikz08,1570439715,"Ever since the KSA concert was announced, I have read so many comments stating that BTS are going against their core message or that their woke image is backfiring on them. I want to understand when did being woke become BTS brand? When did BTS telling their stories relevant to their lives and korean society become code for social spokesmen for the world?
Are they running with that because of BTS socially aware messages? Which are mostly about korean society or everyday youth struggles and mental health. Their messages will obviously relate to outside world and majority became fans for this reason, but why are some acting like they preach about all wrong doings of every corrupt country, society and ethics? They have preached about loving yourself because they have struggled to also love their selves and after seeing so many Armys share their story of BTS changing their lives they then started this message in their next chapter. Why do people give harder time to what BTS does as opposed to other groups who have done the same exact thing? 

I dont think its fair to label BTS woke and expect them to be politically correct of everything around the world. They arent being fed western media. I dont believe the rest of the world has such strong opinions of wokeness like the western world does and I feel like people really do forget BTS are a Korean Group. Their unicef partnership was with Korea for child abuse which I believe they then became global partners obviously do to the reach BTS has. There are other korean groups who have partnered with Unicef for other charities but that never gets thrown at them for being woke? 

BTS arent activists but people seem to judge all their moves like they are righteous activists. I dont understand why anyone has labeled them woke because I do not believe thats their brand. They are just 7 boys sharing stories that they know and relate to the youth. They make mistakes just like anyone else but its like people are so shocked they are making choices they dont agree with and have decided they are sell outs suddenly betraying their brand. Its really bizarre to me. Its like they put BTS on pedestal where they cant make mistakes, and are now labeled as poster boys for wokeness or something. Part of it could be the fans who have propelled them so high and spoken so high of them so that now people view them to an unreachable standard.

Hi guys, 

I'm currently studying marketing in one of university in Indonesia. I'm writing a paper about marketing campaign and business fot my study. BTS-tokopedia partnership kind a catch my interest. I kind of need your help to make sense some of the decision behind it.  

So yeah I'm not sure how familiar are you with current partnership between BTS and Tokopedia. In case you didn't know,  Tokopedia is one of the biggest marketplace in Indonesia right now. For couple last month, they kinda launch this huge campaign across all platform and media to raise their brand awareness. Recently, they're partnering with BTS as their brand ambassador, and I can't help but wonder what will they gain out of this? I feel like this is such a high-risk move for both of them, don't you think?  

For tokopedia, I'm sure that they spent a lot of $$$ to secure this partnership, which I think it's rather a bold move? Considering the brand ""BTS"" themselves has rise exponentially for the last couple of years. I'm sure Army will generate a load of traffic and all. But knowing Indonesia as the target market, I'm not sure if this is a great idea. indonesian customer behavior is nothing alike army/kpop fan by slightest.  I'm curious with how they secure the ROI?    

With bighit, if this is bighit plan to branch and gain some lead with the untapped market in Indonesia, don't you think it's rather premature to secure partnership? what will they gain from this? Think of it, I'm sure bighit has many partnership multibillion dollars offers waiting for them, compare them to Tokopedia's offer, I'm pretty sure it'll felt miniscule.   

And before you answer, yes I know the co-founder of Tokopedia himself said that both bighit and tokopedia company vision sort of match with each other. I'm just trying to find other factors that kinda seal the deal, you know?  

Army please share some of your insights?  

Also, sorry for the weird english, it's hard to vocalize my thoughts though. I hope you get the gist my incoherent thoughts. 

Tl;dr please help me understand why current partnership between bts and tokopedia is such a good idea",10,12

A lot of the time, it is positive (like [this](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8532371/bianca-bonnie-chicken-noodle-soup-interview-bts-j-hope-becky-g) article where Bianca Bonnie mentions the hashtag we trended to thank her). 

But other times, its negative (coverage of things that happened while they were on vacation- not going to mention specifics); and sometimes, I personally think both the action and the response are unnecessary ([iheartradio article](https://www.iheart.com/alternate/amp/2019-10-07-billie-eilish-cant-believe-how-mean-fans-were-about-potential-bts-collab/) about the Billie Eilish interaction). 

Nearly every time these topics were picked up and reported on because of ARMY on social media. Without a doubt, ARMYs support has been a major factor in getting the general public/people who dont know about kpop to pay attention to BTS. There is a saying that is popular in the entertainment world, based on something Oscar Wilde said: There is no bad publicity....but I sometimes wonder to what extent this is true, if at all? What are your thoughts on ARMYs social media power?

Sometimes the boys say some really deep stuff that surprises and impresses me and I just wanted to ask if anyone has come across a quote of the boys that left you with the same feeling?  


I'm talking about direct quotes and not song lyrics. Sometimes they really make me pause and think hard and deep about life, my existence, the universe, you know, things like that. And I start wondering where the hell BigHit found these guys because they seem just unreal.  


One of these quotes for me is from **Namjoon**, when he said:  


&gt;""***This moment will forever be my dream.""*** 

  
The full context was:  

*You know how they say, the so-called American Dream, it's a dream that I don't know, some say we've reached it, some say not but we've never dreamed it cause it was always considered something we could never dream of. It was impossible but the ARMY, they give it to us when we get together*

*Dear America, thank you for embracing us. Thank you for loving us and accepting us. These 7 boys from Korea who are singers in Korean and who have even different little... speak different languages. You guys truly teach us that music transcends language.*

*Let's put away those dreams for a second. Now I didn't know what to say but I really realized that this moment and you guys here did become our real dream. I mean, that is important, really, the most important thing is this moment, breathing with you guys, singing with you guys, finally enjoying the same thing, the position.* This moment will forever be my dream. *Thank you so much.*  Kim Namjoon, 190520 MetLife Stadium  


That one line, *This moment will forever be my dream*, this hit me really deep. This could be from some sort of spiritual self help book, tbh. Like, I once read a quote that said: You have to desire the life you already live. And what Namjoon said was basically this, but even more poetic. I literally stared into space for 5 minutes after hearing him say that. 

The other one that surprised me and made me question my existence was from no other than **Jungkook**, the same guy who has so many times said that he's bad at using his brain, but then he comes and says deep, complex things like this:  


&gt;"" *The guys filled me in one by one. And I think, maybe thats how I became what Im now.*  ***I could be a manifestation of all their characters coming together.*** *I think the guys put my puzzle pieces together. They put the scattered pieces of my puzzle together.* (from Burn the Stage)

My therapist would be proud of him.   
It's not everyone who is able to do this kind of self analysis, especially young men (sadly). I started thinking of my own puzzle pieces after hearing him say this. I was really impressed with what he said here.  


And then there's **Jin** and his quote (that inspired Namjoon, too):  


&gt; ""*I always goof around and get excited about everything. It's because I feel happy when I goof around, but the real reason is  I make people laugh.* ***Actually I use other people to make myself happy.*** ***I make myself smile by making others smile.****"" Bon Voyage S2* 

He's also self analysing and comes to such a nice conclusion. Making others happy to be happy. So simple, so effective. I felt this many times in my life, when I was down and forced myself to cheer up someone close to me, I ended up feeling happy.   


There have been other moments when these guys have impressed me with their words, but these are my top 3 quotes so far. I would love to know if anyone else has some they'd like to share?",71,159

The folder can be accessed by everyone and will always be free so if this things gains momentum and become something useful you should still check it from times to times to have a complete list of all the PCs released :)  
If you want to help me build my app, you can either upload watermarked photos on the album's folder or writing a list of all the photobooks and photocards released, even if without photos a list would be super useful to have some placeholders in my app! 

  
For security reasons (i don't want anyone to copy your photos and print fakes) you should upload only watermarked photos (the watermark can be your reddit name, twitter account or whatever you want) but don't worry rules are inside the folder, i won't make any money with your photos (the app will be released as completely free) and i will credit everyone who helped building the database, of course!

And that's it, feel free to share the link to whoever or wherever you like so we can build a bigger database, the more the merrier! And again thank you to whoever stopped and read this post :)",14,70

For what? To watch someone ""react"" to BTS? That's the lamest thing I've seen.

In the beginning it's cool to see new people liking something you like, but to PAY FOR IT? 

I get why so many ARMY watch this stuff. It's like re-living/experiencing BTS all over again.

BUT I feel like ARMY is being used. If you're a Youtuber and love BTS, then just make the videos, but it seems more like they want you to support them financially.

Reaction videos are the lowest hanging fruit content. People shouldn't be paying for this. Instead ARMY should use that money to support BTS causes like UNICEF, anti-bullying campaigns, suicidal prevention... etc. ANYTHING but Youtubers.

It's such a waste of money.

When he posts a selfie, for example, there are already lots of replies and posts associating him to a kitten. When fans make any content about BTS members' way of dressing, talking, walking etc all they show for Yoongi is a cat while the others are themselves, humans. I am not saying the others don't have their animal associations (eyeing the maknae line), it is cute from time to time, but I don't see it as much as prominent as Yoongi's. I don't want to come off as offensive and hateful in any way.

so i guess my question is, am i being too uptight about seatbelt practices? or is it the norm to go beltless? 

like i said, i really dont want to come off sounding like a manager army, i know the guys are absolutely, 100% fully capable of making their own judgement calls when it comes to what they choose to do, but this is just something that has always stood out to me and i wanted to bring it up. 

it just seems like the kings of safety first safety second coolness third should be putting their seatbelts on, at least in my perspective.",46,20

I said that if JK has real tattoos on his knuckles (only there, not his arms or whatever), I would be disappointed. Tattoos there specifically are seen negatively in most parts of the world, and tattoos in general are still pretty iffy in Korea. Because I'm not 100% supporting everything JK wants to do and see this poorly, why do people think that I deserve to be bashed for that? It's ridiculous. It really makes me question being part of the community in general, despite ARMY usually being lovely and welcoming.

As a side note, this is not the only 'issue', just one of the current ones that I don't have entirely positive feelings about. Also, I'm not against tattoos - just knuckle/hand/face tattoos that are permanent, regardless of the 'meaning'.",11,0

I wanted to share something that my daughter and I talked about when we saw BTS earlier this year. I thought the show was incredible -- absolutely one of the best live performances I've ever seen. The guys are SO talented and the lighting and stage effects were unlike anything I've ever seen. And one of the coolest parts was definitely the coordinated lighting effects of the tens of thousands of Army Bombs  throughout the stadium.

Since the Army Bombs can connect to the phone app as well as to BLE in the stadium, we kept thinking that it would be so cool if, when BTS is in concert somewhere *else* in the world and you can't attend, you could turn on your Army bomb and connect it to the phone app and see the same lighting that's happening in the stadium. Would be an awesome way to connect with fans all around the world. They could even use it when they do other livestreams or similar events.

So just thought I'd mention it here in case anyone knows anyone who knows anyone . . .

Thanks again everyone for your help making my surprise work. She's still enjoying finding the cans!",16,152

460,2019-10-12,2019,10,12,14,dgqxmc,BTS perfroms in RIYADH!,AfzalOzil360,1570858034,"I am curious as to how this first ever international solo artist concert was in Riyadh. 

BTS performed live yesterday as part of their world tour series. Besides facing a lot of criticism from human right groups, who have officially tweeted out their objection towards the bands decision to perform in such ""Authoritarian"" regimes. BTS still choose to perform and defended their decision to do so.

Riyadh was lit purple to welcome the band. The entourage that was sent to guard them to their venues was massive. They got the most Royal Treatment ever. I am sure army (BTS FANBASE) had an amazing time.

With that interlude, let's move on to the question. This is a band that has openly supported LGBTQ+. A lot of homosexual and trans people see this as a let down. Twitter has been flooded with tweets condemning the decision of the band to perform.

On the other hand BTS is openly feminine just like any kpop group, which goes against a hell lot of Islamic values. Islamic (states) like Dagestan also banned screening their movie a few years ago. 

So how did the religious clerics in Saudi Arabia cope up with such a disapprobation? Was their any resistance? or have the clerics given up? 

Let me remind you, Saudi is seen as a birth place of Islam. People look at it as a home ground of Islamic values.

Would appreciate an answer. Thanks.",0,0

I'm hoping there are some generous, patient, kind fans out there to help me with this. I'm really struggling to understand some of the articles I've been seeing about the controversy around the boys playing in Riyadh. I've seen discussions of the country's human rights abuses, mistreatment of women, etc ... but I'm struggling to see how this then becomes a reason to deprive the tens of thousands of fans from seeing the boys performing? I feel like the fact that they'd filled a stadium that was not open to women as recently as 2017 (yikes), to use it as a blistering beacon of self love, empowerment, and solidarity amongst a female heavy fanbase surely is a step in the right direction?

Even more confusing is this claim that bts is ""'whitewashing' an authoritarian regime""? How do korean boys whitewash? Unless proceeds of the concert are going to the government, which would be HIGh key dodge, and I don't have any reason to think this is happening, I'm genuinely at a loss at what the justification for the controversy is.

Suga - as someone who also wants to come back in the next life as a rock, Id like to know how he keeps up with the groups chaotic energy while maintaining his sanity (even though we get glimpses of it slipping)

Jimin - how he dealt with body image issues at the beginning of his/BTS career. Would finish it off with fashion inspo, obvi

RM/Jin - just talk to me about everything and anything, Id want a peek into their genius minds, hopefully get a dad joke thrown in there

Here to talk about the two birthday projects we are doing for our fairy Jimin!

Firstly, continuing on with what we started with the other members' birthdays, we are doing the flash 48 hour donations for One Tree Planted as well continuing to encourage people to submit their environmentally friendly activities to our form and help create a map of all the environmental actions that ARMY have taken.

Link to fundraiser to map: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1183004086335135747](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1183004086335135747)

Secondly, our month long birthday project for Jimin. This month, we are doing #HomeWithJimin partnering with Za'atar, an NGO in Greece. Za'atar is located in Athens and supports refugees through providing food shelter, and training. They have a specific focus on more vulnerable communities such as women and their children as well as LGBTQ refugees. Their shelter in Athens, Orange House, follows sustainable, ecological operational methods as well. 

Full thread with directions on how to donate here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1180947232633307138](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1180947232633307138)

This month, we have two parts of the side project. Firstly, we are encouraging ARMY to create promises of love and positivity for themselves or other, submit them, and then Chuseok 2020 we will send them back to people and share them. The second part is that we are going to write a song together to the tune of Promise. ARMY can submit lyrics and if enough are submitted, a song to that tune will be created out of the lyrics of comfort, strength, and self-love

So I found myself looking back on my past year with the boys and with ARMY, but also looking forward. I am of course super hyped about the new album - I love their darker concepts and think Shadow will blow us all away! I am also looking forward to their return to Europe, so I can have my very first concert experience!!

I will be going to Seoul (first time ever!) to attend SY on the 27th. I miraculously won the raffle (yay!) but then they gave me literally the farthest seat away (the second to last row in the first floor sections welp) but hey ho, Im still very very excited! 

However Im currently a nervous wreck. Im going to the concert alone, my mom is tagging along with me and she wants to wait for me outside for the duration of the night, which is further increasing my anxiety, especially since I found out that the concert is going to be 3 AND A HALF HOURS long and not your usual 2 and half hours. 

So, people who have been to Seoul before, especially for a concert at Jamsil, I have a few questions: 

- Is it safe for my mom to wait outside for me for 3 and half hours? Shes insisting and I cant do anything about it (keep in mind Im a full grown adult lol but my mom knows how nervous I am). Will there be people outside to keep her company? If not, would it be safe regardless? Are there any cafes around where she could spend her time? 

- Also, since the concert is 3 and a half hours long then Im guessing it will finish at 11pm, Im extremely anxious over making it back to my hotel in time.. Im REALLY worried and Im getting a lot of panic attacks over it because Im actually really bad when it comes to subways (I got lost a few times in London back when I was a student but that wasnt so bad because I can speak English, meanwhile I dont speak any Korean so getting lost in Seoul at 12am and not being able to speak any Korean is not exactly ideal) - so my question is, what are my means of transport from Jamsil back to my hotel (which is situated in Gangnam)? I know theres the subway but what if I miss the last train? This really worries me  would there be any taxis around? People who have been to concerts in Seoul (in Olympic stadium) how did you get back to your hotel? PLEASE give me all your advice. Ive googled Ubers in Korea but apparently the service doesnt work there and if it does its all in Korean and if it does work there I never Ubered in my life so that would be a hassle to work out. Ive heard of Kakaotaxi but Ive also heard that these taxis can leave you stranded if they feel like it or if its too busy.. Also Ive heard that regular taxis can also leave you stranded if they deem your destination too far away (my hotel is ~15 minutes away from Olympic stadium ) Also fun fact, I never used bus transport because it confuses me more than subways (I swear theres something wrong with me when it comes to transport)

If my post is in the wrong place, then Im really sorry, but my anxiety is currently through the roof. Anyone familiar with Olympic stadium and transport FROM the stadium please give me all the advice (please let me know if there are taxis around, google maps makes me think that the stadium is so far away from taxis for some reason but google maps does that for everything so I dont know )",48,34

I also sadly couldnt afford tickets either. Its just an experience I wish I wasnt so envious about but I cant help it haha - especially those who got to be front row where you can see their faces &amp; all that. Its sad to think Id never really get to experience that. 

The other hand is my bias is Suga. I just get sad that Id never get to have a conversation with him. He really changed my life with The Last, hearing something so vulnerable &amp; raw really allowed me to reach out for help &amp; stop being afraid to share my dark feelings. Of course Id love to hang out with all of them, Suga is just a little more special to me haha. 

How do you come to terms with this stuff? I was just wondering how you guys do it haha",62,64

What is probably NOT so normal is that I am a 50 year old grandmother (who is getting my 74 year old mother involved now too, LOL) and the rest of my family think I am having a mid-life crisis going crazy for a bunch of SK kids younger than my children are, haha. I can't get them to understand that first of all, IMO, the language barrier isn't even a problem because the music is just THAT phenomenal that it doesn't even matter that you don't know what they are saying (they HAVE inspired me to learn Korean though...so far I can introduce myself formally and informally, hehe). Then once you find out the ACTUAL lyrics, you are blown away a thousand fold that such YOUNG men have the depth and insight to speak so eloquently, and with such emotion that they are able to touch millions of lives the way that they do. It also doesn't hurt when you take into account the unbelievable choreography, hilarious personalities, and the awe-inspiring visuals they give us too. All added up, they are 100% the whole package, tied up with a beautiful, glittery bow, hehe. ;)  
Anyway, about my project. One of the first things I noticed (after I finally got to where I could figure out who was who, LOL) was the stark contrast between the boys personalities in real life compared to when they were performing on stage. So I decided to occupy myself with making a series of videos comparing that very thing for each member (since I am wholly occupied now with all things BTS when I am not doing family oriented things anyway, haha). It wasn't until after I made this 1st video that I discovered I wasn't very original and this concept has been done before, but since I have already started I am going to continue because I had such fun doing it. This 1st video is on Kim Taehyung (one of my bias/Kookie being the other, as I couldn't choose between them lol). I am sorry for the watermark on the vid, but as I am unskilled on video editing I wanted to experiment with the free version before I spend money getting the watermark removed, which I will probably do as I really enjoyed making this video. Next up is Jungkook, of course, then J-Hope (my bias wrecker) followed by the rest but I'm not sure of the order yet.  
   Please give me any thoughts on the video, and suggestions on what kinds of videos I can possibly make in the future as this is only the beginning of my amazing BTS journey. I have joined the Amino Army app, joined twitter (@ my age lol), and even have my Youtube page but I am not really getting any feedback. I am just really needing to meet like-minded people that I can relate to and discuss things with about this because right now I am alone in my love of them and I want to share. : ( I am very proud to call myself ARMY.

#An FAQ about moderating:  
 
##What the job entails

70% of the job is removing posts that break the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules), posting the reason for why it was removed, and sometimes defending/changing your decision as well as replying to modmail. The rest of the time is split between finding out what the general sub community wants/their opinions on rules, and figuring out what would best keep the sub happy and healthy. 

It also involves planning fun events sometimes, like the [50k sub event](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/armxbt/rbangtan_50k_subscriber_eventgiveaway_thread/) a while back ;) So you need to know the rules pretty well, be able to make judgments based on those rules as unbiased-ly as possible (nobodys perfect!), and be able to communicate with the community and the rest of the mod team in a diplomatic and non-inflammatory way, both when replying to modmail and in comments.  

##How active do I need to be?

Depends on the day. Some days require less removals than others. Any time there's a big event (BBMAs, Grammys, etc), it requires a lot more attention than, say, a day like today. During comeback season we pretty much need all hands on deck all day as often as possible. But for a sub of this size right now (and keep in mind it's growing every day), it's generally fine if a mod is checking the sub and dealing with reports and removals about every 30 minutes or so. We should see you moderating *at least* a few times every week, *ideally* every day.   

##Is being a moderator permanent?

No. If you ever have any real life issues that would prevent you from actively modding, you are welcome to leave at any time. That being
said, if you know you have a big life change coming up that will stop you from modding, or will only be active during certain parts of the year, we urge you not to apply. Having to find and train new moderators to do this job takes quite a bit of work for the old mods too, and wed prefer to do it as little as possible. We like having a tight-knit core team :)    

##Can I still interact with the community?

Yep! You can still comment all you like about how Jungkooks newest Twitter selca made you UwU if you wish. However, being a moderator may make it more difficult to interact on contentious discussion posts. 

If theres a chance of it being removed later, and you said you disagreed with OP in the thread, some people will think its the moderator being biased and removing something just because they didnt like it. (This is never true FYI, we always consult other mods before removing something we know were biased about to make sure we arent acting purely out of bias). 

Moderating can also take time out of your day, so rather than typing out a comment for an hour, youll instead opt for a quick sentence. That doesnt mean you cant interact in ANY discussion posts or disagree with anyone ever - just be mindful of which ones you *are* commenting in, and how youre wording it!

592,2019-10-16,2019,10,16,4,did2xr,That initial amazement when opening a new BTS package/album?,iNajra,1571168079,"Hi all!

I just wanted to get your opinions or views on getting some new BTS merch, specifically the nicely packaged albums or DVD packages.
I just got the summer package, which is the first real package I got (not counting regular albums) and I was just SO impressed with it all. I always eagerly look forward to the unboxing, discovering which postcard I got etc., but this was a whole new experience. I spent so long just leafing through the photo book, marvelling at the larger photo prints, the poster... I cant be the only one right? 

But after the initial amazement, I put everything back in the box and just put it with the rest of my collection, and I feel like ... well, the unboxing is the best part about the extras (aside from actually watching the footage or listening to the music of course)? So now I am already anticipating the new album or ARMY kit... 

I am wondering whether you sometimes still take out older albums to rewatch the photo books? Why do you do it, or how often? Or what do you do with them after unpacking? 
What about the photo cards? I put some of them on a piece of wall dedicated to BTS, but dont have room for all of them, so keep the others in a decorated box.",36,62

What the heck is going on? I am about to write a BTS fanfiction and I want it to be beautiful. (I can almost guarantee you will hate it.) Also y'all should know; I am uncomfortable using ""y/n."" I have no idea why, it just gives me the heebie-jeebies. Because of said ""heebie-jeebies,"" you are all Bianca. I don't care if you picture yourself as Bianca, or Bianca as an independent character, but it's got to be Bianca. 

*AHHHHHHH!* (Please note that this yell sounds like if Count Von Count from Sesame Street were trying to sound like Chewbacca.) I yell in  my head as I open my eyes to the beige walls of my tiny, yet comfortable prison, (which everyone else calls Bianca's one bedroom apartment). During this time I normally contemplate whether I should actually get out of bed and do things, or if staying in bed is actually the way to go. But whenever I have these lazy thoughts I  can't help but feel like I'm sinning. Which causes me to wonder, why it feels like I'm sinning? What is it that makes me think being lazy makes me a bad person? *Gasp!* I've been in bed for 30 minutes now!

*Do I eat breakfast? Do I not eat breakfast? Do I even have milk? Shit, I don't have milk. Well, I guess I'm not eating breakfast.* I then set an alarm for 15 minutes on my phone, and decide these next 15 minutes should be spent sleeping.

That last decision to take a ten minute nap was a terrible one. When I was supposed to wake up, I was still tired so I end up hitting the snooze button twice. Which means . Oops. *Ok, this is fine. I will not be late. Now, what time does class start again? Wait, what class do I have? What day is it? Oh, man! It's Tuesday. Yo, I don't even have class on Tuesday.* 

Meticulously, I managed to get up and put some effort into getting ready for the day. Your Girl was looking fine (Please not that this word should be pronounced by holding the ""I,"" letting your voice get smooth, deep, and raspy.) When I get ready I like to think what would Georgina Michel wear? Who is Georgina Michel? She's my alter ego. Beyonc is Sasha Fierce and I am Georgina Michel, the women version of George Michael. This was just a really long description of how I have the same style as a fashionable man from the Late 80's to mid 90's.

**Outfit Description:** I was wearing a pair of thick white socks that went up to my shins. They were from a popular shoe brand, so it's no surprise they are my favorite pair of socks. I also had jeans on, and a shirt. It was quite the look.

I sat down on my sofa in the living area. *At last, I have nothing to do*. Which felt relieving and peaceful for the first 5 minutes  but then I got bored. *Huh.* Luckily, boredom is a stimulus for my Generation Z instinct, so I reached for my phone. *Oh my word; breaking news! ""BTS is in Minnesota for surprise concert,"" what the fuck?* This was insane. This was way too much to handle at 11:40 in the morning, (everybody wakes up at their own pace, mine is just slower than most). BTS! Here in my home state! I had to know everything; I had to know ""Why Minnesota?"" I had to know ""Where in Minnesota?"" I had to know ""How long (would they be in) Minnesota"" Did I *need* to know that last one? Probably not. Google-ing the first two!

*Oh shit, thats my college! Oh shit, that means me. Oh shit*! BTS was making a surprise visit to the University of Minnesota- Twin Cities! They were going to play at the US Bank Stadium, which is only a ten minute drive from my apartment complex. And to top it all off students of The University (which I am) get in for half price! *Gasp! Oh, what a day to be alive*, I was thinking to myself, but apparently lots of other people were thinking that too.

There was so much yelling outside my building. I looked out my window and oh wow a storm of people were running towards my building. *Why my building?* I looked down and there were 7 men in my parking lot. I knew right away it was BTS. They were surrounded by like 5 bodyguards. They were going to be demolished.

I have never ran that fast in my life and honestly I do not know if I will ever be able to again. I live on the 4th floor, that means I went down 4 flights of stairs in my nice white socks, (I did not have the amount of time that shoes required) and made it all the way to the main entrance doors in under 2 minutes. Your girl was cooking.

""BTS!"" I yelled at them as I opened the door. They turned their heads and looked at me at the same time. ""COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!"" I yelled at them. No one moved. Then I realized they probably didn't know that whenever you want someone to come with you and take whatever it is happening extremely seriously, you say ""come with me if you want to live.""

""I'm Sorry?"" said RM*. AHHHHHHHHHHHH, RM just spoke - to me. Oh no. My heart rate cannot handle this*. I don't have time for this. ""I CAN HELP YOU GET AWAY FROM THEM! I yell and gesture to the crowd of people that were getting too close for comfort. Within the 3 seconds it took for RM to make up his mind, you could see him weigh out all the decisions in his head. Then he broke into a sprint towards me, shortly joined by the rest of the members. *Gasp!*

The members rushed through the door and the body guards were right behind  them, but I stopped them at the door. ""Hey! Bodyguard people, Sorry! You block the doors so the fans cant come in. I'll take them to my apartment so they'll have a place to wait out this crowd or for more security."" I then turned around and rushed to BTS.

I don't stop to explain anything, we don't have time for that I can already hear the pounding on the doors of the fans. ""This way!"" I yell as I run past them. They follow. We make it up the 4 flights, and we are now safe in my apartment, hopefully.

But*, Oh SHIT! bts is in your apartment. this is fine. Everything is fine. You are the Hostess with the Most-ess for all your family events. You are no longer a social butterfly, you are a social queen bee. Now, go make some goddamn HONEY!* Let's do this shit.

""So BTS,"" I start. ""Welcome to my apartment. Um, I'm sorry it's not very clean right now, if I would have known I was having company I would have cleaned I swear. Oh gosh, honestly where are my manners? My name is Bianca. Its a pleasure to meet all of you"" I start shaking everyone's hand. They shake my head then bow, it threw me off guard but I bowed too.

""I'm so sorry that this is happening to you. I say You do not deserve this. As much as I love being able to be in the same room as BTS, I am really sorry for the circumstances it seems to be in."" 

J-Hope looks at Jimin. His face says ""did you get any of that?"" Jimin's face says the same thing, but he looks happier about it. V has the signature ""lights on, no ones home"" look on his face*. I think I love you*. Everyone else just looks confused and a little scared, which is understandable. *I guess I kind of kidnapped them didn't I*? RM responds ""Um, thank you for helping us. We really don't want to be any trouble.""

""Oh nonsense! I just talked about how I was so happy y'all were here!"" We are standing in the kitchen/porch area like weirdos. I smoothly suggested we sit in the living room. I pick a spot on the floor where a tv would be if I had one. Next to me, RM sits on the recliner with Jimin half on his lap half on the arms of the chair. Suga, J-Hope, and V share the sofa, while Jin and Jungkook sit next to me on the floor and take up the space between me and V. We were in an oval that went around my coffee table.

""So I don't exactly have anything to do here except for like card games and thats about it. Unless you are hungry I can whip up something really quick."" I hear Jungkook gasp a little next to me and in unison the members turned to look at RM.

""You want to cook for us?"" he asks me.

""Um well it is around lunch time and I didn't have any breakfast so I could eat, and I figured y'all probably could too."" I answered. 

""Are you sure?""

""Yeah, I don't have much variety so I was just going to throw like 3 frozen pizzas in the oven. Would that be alright with everyone? I think they are all cheese. Normally, I would add my own pineapple and pepperoni on them, but I don't have to do that this time.""

He translates what I can only assume was ""Do you guys want pineapple and pepperoni frozen pizza?"" to the rest of BTS. They all nod their head yes so I preheat the oven and get out the frozen pizza as well as pineapple, pepperoni, and shredded cheese. I tell the members that they can decorate the pizzas with toppings if they want. Jungkook, Jin, and V rush up at the offer.

*WTF is going on? I am putting pineapple on a frozen pizza with BTS. I do not believe it and I have decided that this is all a dream.*

While waiting for the oven to preheat I ask the members if they normally call each other by their stage name or their birth name? Have they just gotten so used to being referred to as their stage name that they just go by that now? They answer the question saying that sometimes they call each other by their real names and that when in front of the camera they always try their best to say the stage names.

The pizzas went into the oven. I ask them what their favorite song performance ever was (when they thought they were sounding best). Although talkin with BTS is amazing and I can't help but feel like there could be an easier way of translating other than RM. I feel bad for him. I ask him if he would prefer it if we used google translate and talked into it instead of him having to translate everything. He said he didn't mind at all and that made me feel a lot better.

The pizza then come out of the oven, but we have to wait for them to cool. All three of the pizzas started as cheese thin crust, we ended up having 2 pineapple and pepperoni and one pepperoni. They were beautiful. I then asked BTS what questions they don't like being asked and they said the ones about their personal life. Then it struck me just how crazy the members of BTS's life are*. Shit is whack*. Suddenly, I felt a wave of braveness wash over me and I the next thing I knew I was saying; ""Do you guys have any questions for me? A member of the ARMY?"" then I did a little solute with my hands. *Adorable. I swear to god, cuter than a little bug in a little rug.*

""What is your favorite song?"" Jimin asks. *Oh yes. It is official. You are dreaming. None of this is real Park Jimin just asked you what your favorite BTS song is. What in tarnation is going on?*

""That's a tough question. Can I do my top 3 songs instead? I ask.

""Yes, top 3."" Jimin says with a cheesy smile on his face.

""Cool. Ok. My top three favorite BTS songs (in no particular order) are; Boyz with fun, Home, and Paradise."" They are all surprised by my answers. I think Boyz with fun surprised them the most. When I said that song he burst out laughing. I know that everything makes him laugh but it meant something to me.

I cut into the pizza and get napkins for everyone to put their slice on. It gets silent from everyone busy stuffing their face with food. BTS was hungry they devour that pizza. But then again I did have 6 slices. Oops.

""Who is your bias?"" V says then smirks. *The audacity of this man! To ask that kind of question and then not only keep intense eye contact with me but smirk too? No. It should be illegal. This is how I go. Kim Taehyung smirked at her and then she died. That's the story that will be told about me. The sad part is that doesn't sound too bad. I mean, you get to have Taehyung keep eye contact and smirk. Worth.*

Once I regained consciousness, I blushed like no other. I was trying to keep my cool and tell myself I'm a bad bitch who doesn't blush at cute Korea boy band members smirking at you. Get it together! But that didn't help physically, only mentally. (You could still totally tell I was blushing.)

""I don't know if I should just tell you who I have favoritism for. I know we will only interact with each other for a short amount of time but it still doesnt seem like a good idea. You know?"" I said

""I'm sorry could you repeat that,"" RM politely asks me.

So I repeat myself and RM translates to the members.

""Oh, you are no fun!"" Jin says to me.

""Hey, you better watch yourself! I'm tons of fun."" I say loudly and add a fun dash of aggressiveness to be believable. He goes wide eyes at my tone and looks to RM. RM translates and Jin's expression doesn't change, he is still just as confused. But Suga, RM, and Jungkook gave a sound similar to a laugh so I'm going to call my sense of humor a hit!",1,0

Like he was dissociating with what he was doing (this was the one where he would constantly purse his lips every 10 seconds or so).

The recent incident (idek how to word it; heartbreaking) with Sulli just really put into perspective how much these idols go through.

BTS is inarguably the biggest boygroup on the planet, and man that must come with so much responsibility. (Not sure if true but I recall Jin saying they were talking about disbandment in 2017)  the fear of having to live up to ridiculously high standards day by day must be killer. Not to mention the obsessed fans (the crippling fear that your personal life could be known to the public at any moment must be crippling), the deadly schedule.

I just hope BigHit gives them the proper support system and a therapist should they ever need it.",1,1

If, yes, does that mean they wont release until 2020? I mean, it is looking like November/December is going to be CRAZY competitive. With possibilities of Adele, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Halsey, Celine Dion, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay, etc... Are they trying to avoid the competition?

At this point after 3 straight number 1 albums, should landing a number 1 be their top priority? Or should it be increasing their sales numbers from their previous releases regardless of where they land on the chart?

Is this Lauv remix a ploy for radio play. Did they make a deal with radio by agreeing to perform at a Jingle Ball in exchange for radio play?

Is this release a ploy to keep them and Persona in Grammy voters minds if they land a nomination?

And if they wait until 2020 to release the next OT7 album, what of these rumored collaborations?

Weve gotten strong hints for Justin Bieber and Jungkook. Maybe Ariana and Jungkook. He DID say he was was working on more than one song. Also Khalid was heavily hinting at a collaboration. And goodness knows what else they have up their sleeves.

And what about Agust D 2!? When is that gonna drop!!

As it stands now, Im about 50/50 in a 2019 comeback. One thing Im sure of, IF there is one, we will hear about it after the Speak Yourself tour finale. Around October 29th. If we dont hear anything by the end of October, Im throwing the comeback to the 1st quarter of 2020.

So what do you guys think?",1,2

After almost 2 years now I've pretty much caught up on everything and there's nothing new for me to really watch. I purposely didn't watch the last 7/8 episodes of Run BTS so that last night I could just sit there and binge them all one after the other because it gave me back that old feeling I used to have and it was so nice, but now once again I've caught up and today I'm like :(((( because I have nothing again.

How do you guys cope with this? I know re-watching is always an option but...there's only so many times I can re-watch the same interview / episode etc. and it doesn't always cure the feeling of missing them in the same way that getting to watch new content does, if that makes sense.",38,28

For those new to the subreddit, we run the census yearly as a fun and comprehensive way to get to know ourselves as a community. 

&amp;nbsp;

The linked document includes data visualization and short answers for the 2018 census. This post, on the other hand, will contain discussions and comparisons from the previous years' results.  **To get the full experience, we recommend reading this post first then taking a look at both at the document afterwards!**

We'll also explain why it took so long to finish this project at the end of this post, but as a summary: life really just got in the way. Please accept our sincerest apologies.

**Anyway, on to the results!**

# Results, Growth, and Changes

Below, we've listed the highlights of the 2018 subreddit census results. For brevity, we used general statements, such as *subscribers* instead of *subscribers who participated in the census*. Last year's 2017 census results can be seen in full [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8v81o5/2017_rbangtan_census_book_and_full_results/), and the 2016 census results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5sjwn5/census_results_2016/). 

&amp;nbsp;

## SUMMARY 
 
- The census was carried out from 1 Dec to 14 Dec 2018. From the 43,527 subscribers (at the time of census closing), **2,013 responses (4.6%) were recorded**.
- While we've had more participants this year, participation rates were higher back when our subreddit was relatively small -- 8.9% in 2017 and 15.7% in 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

## I. DEMOGRAPHICS

**AGE**

- Similar to the last two years, the largest categories are still 18 to 22 years old (707 | 35.1%) and 23 to 27 years old (685 | 34.0%).

- Again, the age profile of the subreddit has increased slightly, around 4-6 percentage points.

- Are we gaining older subscribers? Or is our subreddit community simply growing old together? ^:D

&amp;nbsp;

**GENDER AND SEXUALITY**

- Similar to the last two years, most subscribers identify themselves as female (1,740 | 86.4%).

- Male subscribers (229 | 11.4%) decreased 5 percentage points, returning to a distribution similar to the 2016 census results.

- While subscribers still predominantly identify as straight (1,253 | 62.2%), the proportion of non-straight subscribers has consistently increased by 3 percentage points per year since 2016.

- The second largest category in 2018 is bisexual (380 | 18.9%), then pansexual (117 | 5.8%).

&amp;nbsp;

**ETHNICITY AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND** 

- This year, the Caucasian/White demographic (958 | 47.6%) overtake the Asian demographic, which had been the highest for 2017 and 2016.

- The Asian demographic (869 | 43.2%) is comprised of East Asian (400 | 19.9%), South-East Asian (333 | 16.5%), and South Asian (136 | 6.8%).

- Note that respondents could pick up to 4 options for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**COUNTRIES OF RESIDENCE**

- Respondents came from 73 different countries and territories (an increase from the previous years' 70 and 64).

- As with the last two years, United States still leads overwhelmingly (1,027 | 51.0%), and is once again followed by Canada (181 | 9.0%). The United Kingdom (128 | 6.4%) overtakes Australia (87 | 4.3%) this year.

- Philippines, Germany, New Zealand, Brazil, India, and Singapore complete the top 10 countries.

&amp;nbsp;

**EMPLOYMENT STATUS** 

- The number of employed subscribers (790 | 39.2%) has nearly doubled in proportion since 2016!

- The top employment categories are Computer and Mathematical (140 | 12.0%), Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media (134 | 11.5%), and Education, Training, and Library (131 | 11.2%).

- Students remain as the largest demographic, with undergraduates as the majority (591 | 58.5%), followed by postgraduates (184 | 18.2%) then secondary students (180 | 17.8%). However, this category's percentage has been slowly decreasing since 2016.

- The top undergraduate programs are Engineering and Information Technologies (118 | 20.0% of undergraduates), Arts and Humanities (93 | 15.7% of undergraduates), and Sciences and Mathematics (83 | 14.0% of undergraduates). The top postgraduate category is Medicine and Dentistry (27 | 14.8%  of graduate students).

&amp;nbsp;

**RELATIONSHIP STATUS**

- We're still Single (1,425 | 70.8%), but slightly less so! For the second year in a row, the single category drops several percentage points.

- ( ) 

- This is followed by 'In a Relationship' (333 | 16.5%) and 'Married' (163 | 8.1%).

&amp;nbsp;

## II. YOUR BTS JOURNEY

**TIMELINE** 

- Finally, some changes!

- Most subscribers became fans during the *Love Yourself: Her* era (516 | 25.6%). In fact, nearly half of the respondents joined during the Love Yourself series. 

- There are still some pre-debut fans (19 | 0.9%) among us. Hello!

- *You Never Walk Alone* (then 19.4%) and * pt. 1* (then 30.1%) pulled in the most fans in the 2017 and 2016 census results, respectively.

&amp;nbsp;

**KPOP**

- As in 2016 and 2017, most subscribers had listened to kpop before BTS (1,151 | 57.2%).

- However, new kpop listeners have increased to 42.8% -- from merely 20.1% in 2016. This suggests that more fans unfamiliar to the genre are being introduced to kpop, likely due to BTS' popularity.

- Again, most subscribers have been listening to kpop for 1-2 years (413 | 20.5%).

&amp;nbsp;

**DISCOVERY**

- Similar to 2016 and 2017, most subscribers found out about BTS via browsing YouTube (778 | 38.6%), followed by introduction from a family member, friend, or significant other (510 | 25.3%).

- Around 5% of participants found out about BTS through some kind of Western award or television show, an increase of over 3 percentage points from 2017.

&amp;nbsp;

**KOREAN LANGUAGE KNOWLEDGE**

- Like previous years, most subscribers know a few words of Korean (1,258 | 62.5%).

- And again, most subscribers are interested in learning Korean (1,009 | 50.1%) or are already learning Korean (428 | 21.3%). !

&amp;nbsp;

**MUSIC PURCHASES** 

- While Free Streaming (1,328 | 66.0%) still tops this chart, it has dropped sharply from 2017 (73.4%). 

- Following closely are Paid Streaming (725 | 48.1%), which has increased by over 10 percentage points, and Physical Album Purchases (1,121 | 55.7%), which is at its highest percentage ever.

- Digital downloads (35.9%) have declined over the last two years, but not as much as Arr, Matey..., with only 11.5% of subscribers continuing to sail the high seas, despite having over 25% in 2016.

- Note that respondents could pick as many options as applicable for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**MERCHANDISE**

- A majority of subscribers (1,286 | 63.9%) bought merchandise in 2018. This number increased significantly from 2017 (43.9%) and 2016 (39.9%).

- BT21 merchandise (867 | 43.1%) outsold; followed by ARMY bomb, the official lightstick (687 | 34.1%), other official merchandise (634 | 31.5%), and fan goods (518 | 25.7%).

- Note that respondents could pick as many options as applicable for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**CONCERTS AND EVENTS**

- The number of people who have been to a concert or live event (915 | 45.5%) increased dramatically from 2017 (19.2%), thanks to the Love Yourself tour. This number is predicted to grow even larger for the following years.

- Those who have seen BTS multiple times skyrocketed from 2.9% in 2016 to 16.7% in 2018. 

- Still, a slight majority of respondents (1,098 | 54.5%) have yet to see BTS perform live.

&amp;nbsp;

**BTS NEWS**

- As expected, r/bangtan remains the top source of news for subscribers (1,828 | 90.8%). Everyone say thank you, mods.

- Those using r/kpop (756 | 37.6%) increased in number but decreased by about 9 percentage points.

- Most categories exhibited some sort of decrease, with the exception of Twitter (1,480 | 73.5%), which gained over 10 percentage points from 2017 to 2018.

- Note that respondents could pick as many options as applicable for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**USE OF THE SUBREDDIT**

- In 2018, most subscribers still browse r/bangtan multiple times a day (1,012 | 50.3%).

- Other subscribers browse once a day (436 | 21.7%) or a few times a week (299 | 14.9%).

- However, there are fewer daily visitors in 2018 compared to 2017, but more than those in 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

**BTS FANCAFE** ^NEW!

- The majority of subscribers are not members of the fancafe (1,618 | 80.4%), though the single largest category of responders are those who are interested in membership (897 | 44.6%).

- Of the subscribers who are fancafe members (395 | 19.6%), most have not levelled up (254 | 12.6%).

&amp;nbsp;

## III. FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT BTS (MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS)

- Following are *Love Yourself: Answer* (387, 19.2%) and 2017's favorite, * Young Forever* (354 | 17.6%).

- 2016's favorite album, *Wings*, and its repackage, *You Never Walk Alone* take the 4th and 5th spots. Like in 2017, if these two were combined (534, 26.5%), they would get the top 1 favorite album spot by a wide margin.

**Okay!** So that ends our census results for 2018! 

&amp;nbsp;

What are your thoughts? How similar are you to the average member of the subreddit?

&amp;nbsp;

Do you have ideas for 2019's questions -- maybe favorite RUN episodes, favorite VLIVEs, or a favorite collaboration? For any questions, reactions, or concerns, let us know below!

Since BTS has stopped accepting fan gifts, we can no longer send them a physical copy of the full census. However, we've condensed the results into a small pamphlet, and will be sending it to BigHit!

&amp;nbsp;

The BTS Projects Team would like to thank our volunteers for sharing your time and effort.

&amp;nbsp;

And to the **2,013 respondents** -- thank you all for taking the time to participate in the 2018 census!

&amp;nbsp;

**As for the delay of the census results:** there are only about 3-5 active projects team members at a time. For this project, our primary coordinator managed to crunch a good 90% of the main census data results by early June 2019. Unfortunately, she had to attend to urgent life concerns - so we've had to stagger a transition until July. Analyzing the data against previous years and creating the actual census visualizations took another two months, as we were only able to allocate one person for the task.

At the same time, the three other members just finished handling both Secret Santa and Valentines Exchange, and had to handle the anniversary MustServe projects. Even with the help of our wonderful volunteers, we just weren't able to focus our energy on the census. We hope these don't come off as excuses; we believe that we at least owe you a complete explanation regarding what happened.

Once more, we truly apologize for the delay in delivering the results. The team has been spread thin this year and real life has called with insistence. Thank you for your patience. We look forward to your participation in future projects!
 
&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely,

The BTS Projects Team

&amp;#x200B;

I planned to revisit it a year later to see how much of those seemingly insane sounding ideas came true, and thought you guys would like to see too!

&amp;#x200B;

The predictions that came (at least partially) true:

* Perform at Wembley Stadium
* Stadium tour in the US
* Tour countries in '~~India, Africa,~~ Middle East' (Saudi Arabia)
* Brazil stadium concert (Allianz Parque, not Maracana)
* Concert broadcast internationally (Wembley, Riyadh, now Seoul)
* Top Gaon Album Charts all time
* Top the UK charts
* Album stay in top 10 of BB chart for more than a week (MOTS:P spent a month in top 10)
* SNL performance
* Grammys (presenting/album design nomination)
* Win BBMA for something other than TSA
* A vacation with no staff/cameras (for 'more than 3 days'/'a month')
* BT21 animation (not by Pixar, but we got BT21 universe)
* Soundtrack album (for a game, not a movie)

It's amazing to see how far Bangtan have come in only a year! Is there anything else you'd like to add to the delulu list for the future?",155,340

The moderators are back again to give you some updates on how the subreddit is doing, and things we want to remind you of.  

#1. Civil Commenting  

One of our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_b._personal_conduct) that has been a part of the subreddit for many years now in various forms is the following:    

&gt; **B1. Be civil**   
&gt; No hate speech will be tolerated. If you say something blatantly hateful (racist, sexist, homophobic, etc) you will be banned from the subreddit.   
&gt; Dont be unnecessarily mean, rude, antagonizing or disrespectful towards BTS members, other fandoms, or other users. Trolling and flaming is not allowed.   
&gt; **B2. Explicit content**   
&gt; No explicitly sexual or violent content. This includes explicit commentary, images of injuries and other content that may be inappropriate or shocking.   
&gt; **B3. Reddiquette**   
&gt; Always follow the [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).  

Colloquially in the sidebar and in our mod conversations, we refer to this as the be nice rule. If you *repeatedly* break this rule, you **are** going to be banned. Speaking rudely, dismissively, and patronizingly does not lead to an atmosphere conducive for real conversation - 99 times out of 100, it leads to personal attacks and bitter sarcasm which is why we have a rule against it.  

We want to emphasize here that be nice is **not** referring to *what* you say, its ***how you say it***. There may be nothing wrong with the opinion you're expressing, but if it's stated in an inflammatory and rude way, it has to be removed. You may also post an opinion that goes against other viewpoints or is about a controversial issue, but if it's worded constructively and kindly, there is no reason for it to be removed. Often inside the same thread there are multiple people posting the same viewpoint, but only some of them have to be removed - the difference is in **how it's worded** and if the commenter is arguing in **good faith** or not.  

******

#2. Fanart  

In our [last announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/c29g39/190619_state_of_the_subreddit_rule_reformat/), we announced a major rule overhaul, including a long list of new fanart guidelines. These guidelines were put in place to be a hopefully happy medium between allowing all fanart and allowing none. But as time has passed, we are having trouble with consistently moderating fanart posts with the rules as they are now. This has understandably led to some confusion about the line of a ""low effort"" artwork, for both users and mods. Currently the majority of our time is spent trying to figure out what fanart posts to remove or not, and we cant continue with this intensive amount of moderation for just one category of post.  

We see two main options going forward from here:  

1. Increase post frequency rule to 1 month (currently at 1 week), but loosen the bar for the ""sketch"" rule and let basically most fanart through (which means the amount of fanart will likely increase)    
2. Do the weekly fanart thread

We do know that fanart is **incredibly** popular on the subreddit, as most of our top posts are fanart. But there is also a significant portion of people who *hate* fanart and would rather not see any of it, and we cant please both of these groups. Wed like to hear community input regarding fanart again - and hopefully we can come to a final decision about it.  

Additionally, regarding the rules about marketing and selling different pieces of art, we have rules against self-promotion and using fanart posts primarily as a way to market products. We have this rule to prevent large companies from using the subreddit to make money. Our rules are currently a bit lax, with the idea being to help out smaller artists. However, we have recently seen companies and other greedy individuals using this rule to sell products on the sub. For this reason, we will be much more stringent in not allowing selling or marketing on the subreddit from now on.  

In the meantime, [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRPrqp6Tm4lSSFWIXDnGGdvfdZ2QNTqmdjXNV9_vnYzixCm3sgQNMnjVbwjZJOUI6J8S_CNFLfI8N3m/pub?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=60000&amp;slide=id.p) is a guide to hiding posts and filtering out certain flairs. Additionally, whoever is abusing the report button and reporting every single fanart post as spam, this is against Reddit guidelines and will get you IP banned.

#3. Moderator Applications!  

If you havent heard, we are recruiting new moderators to help us out! If youre interested, please [apply here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/dhiaed/wanted_new_moderators_for_rbangtan_oct_2019/)! All active users of any timezone are encouraged to apply :)    

#4. Miscellaneous  

We have increased the time for hidden comment scores from 5h to 12h. This is to help avoid unfair comment dogpiling on upvotes/downvotes. Before the timer is up, only you can see the vote total on your comment. This is to help users vote on your comment based on its content, not by how other users feel about it.

Although the original purpose of down/upvoting is to get interesting replies to the top and off-topic ones to the bottom, they are mostly used as agree/disagree or like/dislike arrows. This isn't really something we - or reddit itself - can police. Reddit actually [discourages](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_comments) people complaining about downvotes, so throughout the years it became part of the culture to downvote whoever is complaining about it, which is why you may see an increase if someone mentions it.

Vote score is also not reliable for both submissions and comments, because of vote fuzzing. If you refresh the page you might notice that your comment or submission will go down and up a few votes. This is for [anti-spam reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eaqnf/pardon_me_but_5000_downvotes_wtf_is_worldnews_for/c16omup/?context=3). It sometimes leads to others thinking they are being downvoted.

We would also like to remind yall to not use obnoxious comment formatting. This includes using the headline text function to make your text extremely large (\# before any words in a comment will make it into a headline), using all caps lock, not separating your paragraphs by double spacing after the last sentence, or anything else that makes the comment hard to read.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm from Santiago, Chile. Currently, we are going through a very difficult time. The military and the marines are on the streets, there's violence everywhere and many things are going on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I've noticed is how many ARMYs are helping with the situation. Sharing important information, explaining the situation to people from other countries, translating everything to english, giving tips and just wanting to help in general. Even our fanbases are helping.

&amp;#x200B;

These days have been very, very hard, but it warms my heart, seeing multiple accounts with BTS headers talking about our democracy and being extremely socially conscious and involved.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really sorry if this post breaks the rules, I tried reading everything, but it's 4AM and it's been a lonb day. I'm sorry for my bad English, too.",16,124

I feel like there are so many great artists who sing, rap or produce in different languages that don't get a lot of recognition outside of their own countries. 

I didn't know who Lauv or Becky G were before the recent feature and collab, and I really enjoyed them. I haven't listened to the BTS World soundtrack yet, but I have read only good things about Zara Larrson, so I feel like there are a lot of artists from different parts of the world that would fit well with BTS.

I'm a complete musical novice, and BTS is my first real foray into the music world, so I don't have much knowledge about the music around the world, but from what little I've heard of non-familiar music, I have liked.

I would love if BTS collaborates with more nationalities and languages and spreads their music and message to more people that way, as well as bring more attention to the artists themselves.

As for artists from my part of the world that I want BTS to collaborate with, I can only give names of those that I have enjoyed (having listened very little of their music and songs) like, Arijeet Singh, Atif Aslam, Ayushman Khurrana, Armaan Malik, A R Rahman, Sunidhi Chauhan, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam etc.

I have only heard songs from them from Bollywood movies and I'm sure there are a lot more great artists from the rest of India that are great and that would fit well with BTS, so drop their names below, I would be happy to enjoy more songs from different languages, even if I am limiting myself rn to just BTS.

Also, would love for Broadway singers to collab with them as well, like Idina Menzel, I really loved her voice in Frozen, lol.",52,17

Bonus round- rolling stone charts- buzz angles founder left rolling stone just before the start of rolling stone chart.

So we know some issues has been going on with billboard and Neilson for a while and they still don't have proper rules for bundle especially merch bundle which only makes it more easy to abuse (I don't blame the labels though, it's billboard fault that they are making it that easy), we also know that Neilson is going to be under the billboard umbrella pretty soon so what will this all lead to? More problems or actual repair of charts? Will bundling finally have proper guidelines?

And as this is a BTS sub, what will this mean for BTS? Will bighit go with the flow of industry and start bundling for no.1 too? They could easily get 500k debut with just ticket bundles and god knows how high with a merch one. Or will they just keep doing what they have been for now.

2020 is going to be a very interesting year.

Ps- this post was not made to start any blame game against any artist whether western or k-pop period, it's just a post about the problems of billboard and Neilson and what that could mean for the future. Will this cheapen the no.1 if anyone can get it through marketing or is change possible in our future.",37,59

We all know that making the decision to accept the idol life created a lot of internal turmoil for both Namjoon and Yoongi and the decision to become an idol group is ultimately what gave us our beautiful vocal line members Jin, Tae Hyung and Jimin. 

Had they remained a hip hop group, would they have still been performing at the same music shows or are there a completely different types of broadcasts? Would they still perform choreography or is the focus mainly on rapping? Who would have been their contemporaries? I tried to look up kpop hip hop groups but the google results I get are a mix of current and past idol groups with a sprinkling of past hip hop focused groups whose names sounded familiar (Drunken tiger, 1Tym). When I looked to see who were the nominees for last years MAMA best hip hop awards, the names looked to be all individual artists. 

This was something I was thinking about and wondered if some of you who are better versed in kpop would know. Im familiar with some of the other Korean music acts now through association with BTS but I only follow BTS.",65,71

This is my first time posting on reddit, so if I make any mistakes in posting this, I'm truly sorry

I'm currently in the process of writing my undergraduate dissertation on the BTS phenomenon because I was fascinated on how they become so successful in a world where we don't usually accept other forms of music that isn't English (not to mention I am a fan of them myself xD) 

To get some data for my research I created a survey which will take around 10 - 20 minutes to complete. A lot of this is based on fans and how they could have driven BTS to success. I really would like to add an insightful work to the academia about BTS and have it documented for future generations to know about hehe. 

I would appreciate it if you have any time to fill it out or send it to others who listen to BTS/ ARMYs, especially if you live in the UK.

Thank you so much &lt;3

I asked the same question on Quora and one responded with that Youtube does it automatically for you, but I'm not sure if that's true or not. But I digress, my questions are;

* If it's true or not, and if it is - is it okay to allow ads or do I need licensing?
* How do I get licensing for a BTS song? Do I need to get into contact with someone on Youtube or Bighit Entertainment?",9,25

(b) a store with a Bluetooth/portable speaker,

Which would you choose to play and why?

870,2019-10-23,2019,10,23,0,dljcb3,How would you rank the solo tracks from Wings and the LY era?,_Path,1571757413,"Im anticipating / hoping that the upcoming Shadow album includes another set of solos like Wings and LY. Also, given that Persona felt more like a mini album it would make sense that it would. With that said, I was wondering how everyone would rank the solos from Wings and the LY era. I tried searching for something like this but couldnt find anything or maybe its just been a while.

Im also curious to see if anyone matches up with me or is very close as far as rankings go. I enjoy all the solo tracks, so it was more of which I liked more which caused others to get pushed down. 
Wings was a bit harder to rank for me because its been a while since Ive consistently listened to it, but this is based on listening over the past two weeks. Im not sure if its the same as when I first started listening.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wings**:

Stigma

Awake

First Love

Lie

MAMA

Begin

Reflection

&amp;nbsp;

**Love Yourself**:

Trivia: Love

Trivia: Seesaw

Serendipity

Singularity

Euphoria

Epiphany

Trivia: Just Dance

&amp;nbsp;

I think the biggest surprise to me is that I ranked Reflection last from Wings, but Trivia: Love first by RM. That track is one that I cant just listen to once whenever it comes on. And when I saw it live, I was hyped beyond belief, but also felt very emotional. Reflection, on the other hand, is a track that I could never really get into at first and at the same time all the other solos somehow resonated better with me which pushed it down to the bottom.
I could probably talk about the order of everything else, but really I am interested to see how everyone else feels.",64,19

Your favorite Projects Team (that's us) is looking for new members!

For those who don't know us, we [organize and execute various projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects#wiki_eng) for [r/bangtan](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan) subreddit. 

With the growing community and the various projects we'd like to bring to you in the future, we've decided that we need few more members on our team to help us plan and execute them. If you're interested, please fill the application linked here.

# [Link to Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuEAKOtHLnRAwZoev12EYcL_T2ajy9tEci8RKJj_z5UArgyw/viewform)

The form will be open from now till **November 4 @ 11 PM CST**

**FAQ about the Projects Team**

&amp;nbsp;

**What would I be doing if I joined The Projects Team?** 
&amp;nbsp;
We do a lot of different things, depending on your skillset and availability you could be drafting posts for social media (Twitter, Reddit), sorting data entries, answering emails, coding, working on websites, leading a free rice party on a voice channel, proofreading, designing graphics, etc. Honestly, we do a bit everything, but the one thing that you will for sure be doing is talking and planning. The team talks a lot about what we need to work on, things we are working, project ideas (new and updated), how to make projects work, and after all that talking then the fun part, putting them into action. 

&amp;nbsp;

**How active do I need to be?**
Depends - we tend to be a lot busier at the end of the year when we have multiple projects with many moving parts happening at the same time or when we plan bigger projects like MustServe. Right now we are looking to overhaul all of our projects, finding new ways to celebrate BTS and make interactive events for our community, which involves a lot of discussion and planning. Ideally we are looking for members that are flexible and that can spend 1+ hour a week on slow weeks to communicate about things we need to work on, things we are working on, general discussions, and other things as they come up. For the busier weeks and projects, we need members that can dedicate 4-5+ hours a week.

&amp;nbsp;

If you have any questions regarding the application or more questions about what we do and the time commitment, please leave a comment below or PM us!

&amp;nbsp;

We're looking forward to hearing from a lot of you! &lt;3

We started talking about what we did on the weekend. So I told them I made a 4 hour trip to a city to visit a store that sells K-Pop albums and merch. I went there because I saw on their facebook page that they have a small selection of authentic BT21 merch and also some older BTS albums. Both of which arent that easy to find in my country.

Whenever I talk about BTS I get really passionate. My colleges and boss must have noticed because they told me how nice it was to see someone so genuinely excited about something. So they started to ask me questions and we talked about BTS for most of our lunch-break... and, not kidding, in the end my boss even said I should recommend a BTS song to the team at our next meeting (we always have a 5 minute creative input before the meeting starts)... what did I get myself into xD!!!!

Im OT7, but Ive noticed Kookie and Tae seem to be real faves when it comes to this kind of thing, and sometimes ARMY get disappointed when they dont get their bias.

Since its not important to me to have one member or another, I would be willing to trade with someone who was really hoping for JK for basically whomever you DID get. 

Pls DM me if you are interested, and send a pic of your card. 

Ive attached a short clip from my unboxing so you can see. Id ask that you ship first WITH TRACKING, and once I receive Ill ship back.

Ill wait a couple days and if no one is interested Ill go ahead and unwrap and display this one in a frame, because Im honestly happy with whomever.",19,26

I found myself think of BTS at certain points in the conversation because of their association in my head. I mean, I came into ARMY during Tear promotions, so I quickly caught up on all the previous content I could find. Now whenever I hear certain phrases or see an item, the connection to BTS pops into my head. 

Examples:

We talked about a big fire that happened here in our town - the song began flooding my brain.

Whenever I order noodles, I think of Hobi's noodles and Sprite.

Hearing the word ""pardon"" immediately brings to mind RM's English lesson with Jk.

This is further heightened by the fact that it's currently post-Day 1 of the Lover Yourself: Speak Yourself The Final Tour. 
Please feel free to share some of yours, if you'd like to!    
 
Let's take a walk down memory lane with some soft BTS moments!  uwu  

Jin saying that the insulting comments in their old MVs used to say, ""hey dad, what were you like when you were younger? ""i was a member of bts"" (referring to their old hiphop debut days, the comments were mocking them) but now they're LEGENDS. (sidenote: imagine being the child of one of the members and thinking, ""wow my dad is part of BTS"" today!)  

RM being injured at one concert but still worrying about Jimin's leg  

BH producer (Slow Rabbit IIRC) crying on video after BTS won their first Daesang  

Manager Seijin crying also after watching BTS accept their award at one award show  

Yoongi handwrapping presents for ARMY on his bday and saying how he wanted to give them out individually but he couldn't because of their schedule huhu  

Jin snuggling onto Manager Seijin's chest after being embarrassed with compliments at an airport while waiting to board their flight haha what a cutie  

Namjoon saying his dream was to be a dad and Yoongi saying he still can be one  

Jimin telling us in Festa 2019 that he talked to Namjoon for hours about his anxiety/overthinking and comforting him. Such a caring maknae  line member huhu  

Jimin staying true to his word and doing a VLive the next week after his birthday  

Hobi and JK cleaning up the table in domino's pizza at Malta  

An ex-BH trainee telling us his story of how Yoongi took care of him and paid for his ER bill when he got really sick, and how even remembering it now makes him tear up. Such was Yoongi's kindness as a hyung   

Same ex-BH trainee saying the thing that made BTS succeed was the moment Namjoon told them as trainees that they should work hard together to debut and not tear each other down. That was the moment he knew BTS was gonna go far with that kind of leadership  

Namjoon motivating himself through a VLive and telling him he loves himself (day before the UN speech?)  

Yoongi crying after winning their first Daesang and saying him thinking Namjoon worked so hard was the trigger   

the live performance of ""Mama"" by Hobi where you can see the emotion in his eyes and he really means the lyrics, complete with a full gospel choir in the background  

Namjoon hugging Tae after his fight with Jin  

the guys agreeing in an interview that if you want a man/boyfriend who can lead, it's Hobi  

Tae mistakenly tweeting a selfie where he was wearing red glasses hahahaha what an adorkable cutie!!! And him trying to deny it after and posting better pics of himself   

Jin thanking Jimin for being the one to practice _after dance practice_ with him, so he could improve at dancing  

Tae carrying a baby girl at one fanmeet and just being good with kids in general, like his cousins  

Namjoon's worried and overly-apologetic note to ARMY about not receiving any more gifts; compare this with the cheerier tone of Hobi's and Tae's...our leader really overthinking and concerned for any hurt ARMY feels makes me want to hug him huhu  

Jimin and Hobi's very thoughtful presents for Tae (bears) and Jimin (Serendipity CD where only 7 in the world exist) respectively during that one Run episode  

Hobi saying ""BANGTAN (or was it BTS?) FOREVER!!"" when he took the bungee jump, even if he was scared AF  

Jin saying how he was brought up by his mom -- congrats to Mrs. Kim, she raised a wonderful and responsible child   

Jin saying he was only complimented for his looks as a young boy--and also saying that he's now finally a son his mom can be proud of  

Jin always laughing and almost never losing his temper at his dongsaengs, even if they're super annoying and tripping on him haha. he's the hyung they get along with the most I think   

Hobi opening up to us at BTS Festa 2019 about days where he's not ""on"" and he gets tired sometimes too and he's not always 100% sunshine all the time  

Taehyung's emotional speech about his grandma at a concert was the first BTS vid to make me cry actual tears  

Hobi mentioning that one time he was on holiday and he sat in his seat at a bus, and his j-hope persona caused him to say ""toit"" as a sound effect haha and it made him embarrassed. And him saying he needs to turn down the j-hope a little when in public   

JK singing samgyeopsal to ARMY hahaha  

Tae saying how he almost didn't make the cut at BigHit and how he was glad he was part of BTS  

JK doing VLive at an ungodly hour and asking ARMY to eat ramen with him but then he went to bed   

JK always looking up to our leader Namjoonie  

Jimin telling the guys onstage at one concert how much he appreciates them and crying  

Yoongi telling Tae and JK how much he loved them through his end-of-year texts to them @ Festa 2018  

BTS worrying about whether they should say hi to ARMY at the BBMAs or at least greeting/acknowledging us, but they were torn because they didn't want to cause a scene or distract them from other performers/artists. it's such a respectful and modest dilemma huhu they're really considerate goodness gracious  

Typing all these has made me feel all the feels, y'all. Sorry for the long comment but feel free to share your fave BTS moments  I love this fandom, this group, this love. ",66,156

All I hear from people nowadays is BTS, KPOP, etc.
Never listened to them before in my life.
Can someone point me in the right direction?

I really want to give it a try, but I dont know which KPOP band to start with. 

I see that this subreddit is about a specific popular KPOP group, what are some good songs by them too?

I really just want some recommendations, guidance, and advice on the lingo too. I have no idea what a Stan is lol.  

Im no stranger to boybands. Ive been a strict fan of One Direction from when I was 11 until they split up when I was about 17 or 18. Even though I dont follow any musical groups or boybands at this current moment.

Plus I like Japanese music so I figured I might like Korean music as well.

Im also a music junkie and listen to just about anything that sounds good tbh.

I really want to try something new, and be more interesting. I dont have any friends so I figured getting into something thats widely loved, may make me a more interesting person.

I dont mind a boy or girl band, anything works.",26,14

Jin and hobi were on a radio show, I am certain it was just them two, and they were doing this sort of role play acting with the hosts where I think Jin is the boyfriend of the female speaker and then Hoseok is like some guy that is delightfully cheery but for some reason a foil to Jin's character (?). I can't for the life of me find this video and I would appreciate if someone knows where to find it so I can laugh, cringe &amp; uwu.",203,111
1061,2019-10-27,2019,10,27,10,dnn337,VCR Fan Theory,raspberriesyeet,1572140824,"I saw the new VCRs from the FINAL concert. I have a theory about what the next concept is going to be about. It's far-fetched, but I want to see what others think about the idea. This is long, and I essentially summarized it in the end if you want to scroll down.

The next concept could be about acknowledging your dark side. Persona asked the question, who am I? Map of the Soul is the album that is helping in self-discovery. Everyone has a dark side, things that we do not want to show the world and keep concealed. In BTS's new music, they've talked about who they are on TV and in public and who they are to themselves. I think that the next comeback (which is almost 100% going to be called shadow) will explore the side that we hide and often dislike acknowledging. This comeback will say that you cannot make your dark side something that it isn't. But, because this side of yourself is part of you, even that is beautiful. Let's get started.

A shadow is created when light does not pass through an object. It is often representative of darkness. This will be referenced throughout this theory.

Jungkook and Jhope's VCR will be the first one I discuss. I want to talk about the shadows that are seen. I was told by a friend who watched a theory made by xCeleste on youtube that the shadow could represent a butterfly (i'll link the video down below, it's a great theory I watched all of it). I agree with this 100%. To many, bugs are disgusting, we often try to keep them out of our houses. A butterfly is technically a bug as well, but it's still beautiful. That's why Jhope and Jungkook make these butterfly shadows because your dark side is beautiful; no matter what, your dark side is a part of you and makes you who you are. That in itself is beautiful. They want to teach us that our darkness is just as beautiful as our light because both are part of who we are. 

Next is Namjoon and Jimin's. This one was much harder to analyze because their storylines aren't fully completed (why does the flowering arboretum scare Jimin so much? what happened? if this was already discussed, please let me know). Namjoon looks at a forest and sand. A forest was painted on Jimin's wall during fake love. It is a sign of Jimin's hardships. But there's light streaming onto the forest. It could show that his darkness isn't really dark at all. An hourglass is on the ground. It shows that time has run out. In the storyline, Seokjin goes back in time to try and save everyone. So what if here, Namjoon is trying to help Jimin? Moving on, later he removes a glass ball (representing Jimin's hardships in the past) from blocking out the sunlight, which means that maybe he is trying to make Jimin ""good"" and show him the light. But even so, Jimin still has a dark side. We see him try to acknowledge this darkness, but after seeing his shadow, he runs out of the room because he is not able to do this. We see Namjoon repeatedly try his best to keep the glass ball from blocking the sun, but Jimin's room gets dark anyway. There is a connection to wings here. Jimin smiles on the outside, but he lies down on a mattress in exhaustion. Just like in Lie, he pretends to be something he isn't. He pretended to be happy when he wasn't. Now, he's pretending to be purely good and perfect, when he isn't. 

Next up is Taehyung's. He's a very dark person in the storyline. In the VCR, he is holding on to a lightbulb. If you watched the VCR, you'd get dark vibes from it as I did. He sends the light swinging across the room. It zooms in on his face, and it almost looks like he's going back and forth; good or evil? Wings were based on a novel called Demian by Herman Hesse. The main character often believes that things are purely good or purely evil. This scene represents this internal struggle. Is he good, or is he evil? As the camera zooms in, you see his face is only partially dark and partially light. Nobody is purely good, and nobody is purely evil. We are all a mix of both (if you read Demian, you'll know that this is a reference to Abraxas, also mentioned in the BST MV). The light starts flickering. On = purely good, off = purely evil. The scene then shifts over to an alleyway. Taehyung repeatedly tries to run away from the alleyway, but he has to face his darkness because there is no way to run from yourself. Later, Taehyung's face becomes fully illuminated with light. He stands in front of a door-like thing, with light streaming past it. But he looks away; even though he is surrounded by light, he is not completely good. He cannot hide his darkness. This reminds me of Stigma, where Taehyung tries to hide some secret, but he can't. Similarly, here surrounds himself with light to hide the evil. But even so, his darkness still shows (demonstrated by the shadow on his face). 

Lastly, Seokjin and Yoongi. This one was also pretty difficult to break apart. Yoongi and Seokjin are high up in the sky. This is a reference to Awake, where Seokjin says that maybe he'll never touch the sky, but even so, he wants to keep trying. Now, he's finally reached the sky. But is he happy? On his shirt, I noticed at one point, there's a shadow surrounding a white heart on Seokjin's shirt. It's faint but most definitely there. He had good intentions throughout the storyline, but he ended up causing a lot of struggle and confusion for himself by trying to save anyone else. No matter what happened, he didn't succumb to the darkness that he faced. Right after that scene, Yoongi stares at that shirt. He is looking for the heart on his shirt. But, in the storyline, he is corrupted by sadness and anger, both of which are negative emotions. He has a dark side. As the VCR zooms out, Yoongi's shadow is clearly visible, symbolizing this dark side.

In the storyline, I think Taehyung represents someone who would be considered ""dark"" and Jin would be considered ""light."" But even Taehyung isn't purely evil, and Seokjin isn't purely good. In the video, you can see Taehyung holding onto a lightbulb and Seokjin casting a shadow on his face with his hand. The point of this comeback will be to teach us the message in Demian; we are all a mix of good and bad. Also, I see a solid connection to the storyline. Seokjin tries to remove all the darkness from everyone's lives in order to save everyone. But if he allows everyone to acknowledge their darkness instead, they would finally move on and be happy.

We have to acknowledge all of our sides in order to truly understand ourself and be happy.",1,6

If you didnt see, around 2 weeks ago we posted [that we were looking for new moderators to help the team out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/dhiaed/wanted_new_moderators_for_rbangtan_oct_2019/) After reviewing all of the applications sent to us, we have decided on 3 new mods to add to the team!  

Please give a big ol welcome to: u/Incognito_Mermaid, u/whyohwhy115, and u/hoviazshi! Give them a bit of leeway while they learn the ropes around here~ Were sorry for any inconsistencies that might happen while they are being trained!  

*****

In our [last announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/dka1hd/191019_rbangtan_state_of_the_subreddit_fanart/) (please take time to read it if you havent!), we described our current dilemma with fanart, and asked for community input. From that community input, some brilliant users managed to come up with some viable alternatives the mods somehow hadnt thought of before in the past 2 years of trying to manage this. *Hurrah!*  

However, since those suggestions werent explicitly mentioned in the main part of the post and were somewhat buried in the comments (so some werent able to see them as options), we wanted to make a new post to see if one of these new options had more support than the others we proposed.  

#Here are the current list of viable options we have:  

* **Option 1:** Increase post frequency rule to 1 month (currently at 1 week), but loosen the bar for the ""sketch"" rule and let basically most fanart through (which means the amount of fanart will likely increase)   
* **Option 2:** Do the weekly fanart thread   
* **Option 3:** Redirect all fanart into our sister /r/heungtan meme subreddit (pls check it out guys), but also have a weekly round-up post on /r/bangtan (similar to what [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/dka1hd/191019_rbangtan_state_of_the_subreddit_fanart/f4cica0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) suggested, although we would likely not update it real-time or daily as thats what the actual subreddit feed is for), where the top fanart from /r/heungtan is included in a small fanart section of the roundup  
* **Option 4:** A first-come-first-serve queue system in which we'd manually approve 2 fanart submissions per day in the order they were posted. We'd wipe the queue and start over every day, resulting in a total of 14 approved posts per week. The moderation team is hesitant about this option, as it could lead to a few people learning how to game the system and compete for the right to post at reset each day, meaning that people who arent regulars likely wouldnt be able to post. Additionally, we arent 100% sure how consistent this would be from a technical moderation standpoint (as it would all be manual). We still wanted to mention it as a possible compromise for those who want a little bit of fanart in the sub.   

Additionally, we would like to ask what people think about the less common types of fanart submissions, such as [animations like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7urykk/mic_drop_animation_by_kiera_arwen/) (or like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/c9f4h7/animated_jungkook_fanart_by_me_some_description/)), or [crochet dolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/d2xgje/crochet_doll_of_cypher_pt_3_suga/), or other types of high-effort fanart like this that cant be replicated frequently. Most of our rules right now are focused on the majority of submissions that we get, meaning things like digital edits, digital drawings, paintings, pencil sketches, etc. Would these be an exception, since they arent submitted nearly as frequently, or would they open up too much grey area and should have the same fate as the rest? (Note: if the mods felt that the submission rate of these types of things increased dramatically any time after making them an exception, we would step in and make it follow the same rules as the rest of fanart).   

Please let us know what option you would prefer, as well as any other comments or concerns you might have!",74,68

I'd like to make a playlist to share with some of my friends who just became ARMY. They did not have a chance to go last night. I did see a post with a LYS tour setlist, but it is a little different.

I have this marked as spoilers because I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone who hasn't seen the performances yet. I had not seen any of the LYS tour and I was blown away/surprised by some of the songs they chose.

I do not think these are in the correct order. Thank you in advanced for your help, fellow ARMY!

I really loved how Wings was structured:

Intro
Vocal Line song
Rap Line song
7 solos
5 OT7 songs

Total of 15 tracks

Do you think the solos will be on Shadow or saved for Ego, which will most likely be a compilation or a re-pack?

I also want solo teaser films like Wings. Everything points to Shadow being that bitch. I feel like for the 2021 Grammys they want it to be a serious contender for Album of the Year.

I see alot of fansite accounts posting pictures from concerts, which makes me really curious about who they are. Like not to reveal their names or anything but questions like:

Are they just normal fans that go to every single concert and get front row seats to get these pictures? Or are they a group of people? Im assuming it would be super expensive to attend every concert but they seem to do it! Do they get special privileges from Bighit to attend concerts or do they have to enter the raffles? How are they allowed to carry their equipments into the convert venues?

I was inspired to ask this question after seeing t[this tweet](https://twitter.com/dailyggukks/status/1188946528314052610?s=21) about Namjoon recognizing Honeyjoonie94. (Not sure if its factual)

For me, I love the Dior outfits particularly the various versions of Hoseoks outfit. I was so excited when it was announced that Dior would be designing for them, and I hope they work with another high-end designer for the next tour as well. I also love Taes first green robe and the subsequent gothic black feathered coat for Singularity, and Hoseoks striking all-red suit for Just Dance at the Final concert in Seoul. Seems like I lean towards the dramatic in my taste of costumes; since its for a big stage why not go all out?

I have to bring up Tear for its stunning stage. The flames and special effects on the big screen were unreal and rapline looked like they stepped out of a movie or video game. It took their stage presence to another level.

So I was voting for MAMA, and in the Best Dance Performance section, I noticed that all nominees were title tracks. This made me a little upset because while I do love Boy in Luv, Dionysus is simply the best choreography I have seen in a while.

I am new to kpop so I was curious if MAMA has previously nominated a non-title track performance for the said category.  If not then can anything be done to change that?

I guess I am just upset to not see Dionysus there.",0,2
