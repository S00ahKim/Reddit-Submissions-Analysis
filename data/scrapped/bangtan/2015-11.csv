A dance off between the two would be NUTS.

Another collaboration I'd love to see would be one between our boys and GOT7, because I feel as if they're often seen as rivals. If they were to interact more, it could bring the fans together and lessen the rivalry and then we can all be happy together :3

25,2015-11-10,2015,11,10,1,3s5e6b,2016 Seasons Greetings Pre-Order Is Up! How To Order~~,slamwinchester,1447086707,"Just a heads up this went up last night on several sites! I spoke with someone in /r/kpop who wasn't familiar with how to order, so I thought I'd share here how I pre-order items like this, as well as a few other methods...and I figure other people can post here too with what they do since there are MANY options, I'm only covering a few I'm familiar with:

My website of choice is www.yesasia.com. The pricing on here is a smidge higher, but the benefit is anything over $50 is free shipping--and shipping for items can get very high from kpop sites from my experience. Here is a link to the item directly (since the navigation on their site takes some getting used to!): http://www.yesasia.com/us/bts-2016-seasons-greetings-standing-paper/1046376855-0-0-0-en/info.html

Total from yesasia is $65.99, free shipping.

Another site people swear by is ktown4u. I've heard their shipping is faster than yesasia, but the shipping is pretty high from what I've seen. Prices are really good there, but I looked into purchasing a few CDs from there and the shipping ended up being almost the cost of the items themselves. I think between the two, you have to price compare keeping shipping in mind! Here's a link to the item directly: http://ktown4u.com/iteminfo?biz_no=341&amp;goods_no=22125

As you can see, the price is MUCH higher on yesasia, but there is no shipping. Shipping on the item from ktown, once I add it to the cart and go to check out, totals the item to $90 : http://puu.sh/lfizP/8b2bbef065.png

So that's something to keep in mind!

The other option I'm aware of us the BTS official store. I have NEVER ordered from there so I'm not even sure of the procedures. I have heard that shipping is pretty high from there as well:
http://btsofficialshop.com/shop/shopdetail.html?branduid=1101067&amp;xcode=001&amp;mcode=005&amp;scode=&amp;special=3&amp;GfDT=bG93UQ%3D%3D

If anyone wants to comment on the cost from the official store to compare, or if they have another site they regularly order from, I'd love to hear it!

And this is a pre-order, will release on Dec 9 for those who don't know...I'm pretty sure for this item, as with the previous Seasons Greetings/Summer Packages, you NEED to pre-order, because once it releases it is gone! I hope this helps, just let me know of anything I may be missing or if my links don't work &lt;3",7,5

Which member was the first to capture your eye and are they still your bias or have things changes since youve gotten to know the group better?
My first experience was the Dope MV. I was watching a youtubers react to kpop video and this was the first time that I saw a kpop video that actually really caught my eye, the dancing was awesome and music was really catchy. Immediately Jungkook caught my eye and he's still my bias to date &lt;3 (though sometimes Suga sneaks his way up close). This was my first time getting into a Kpop group (I still dont like any others). I didnt even consider looking up more of them at first but then I heard War of Hormone and I was like ""Dayum two good songs in a row.""
You know what? I'm so glad I watched that react video on a whim because BTS has brought me so much good music, laughs and jungkook feels ~~which reminds me I need to learn korean so I can say my wedding vows~~ So how did you first get into BTS?",40,19

Jin - Boy in Luv or 00:48 of [this](https://youtu.be/-H0mVL4WVqg) video.

Rapmon - this guy doesn't change his appearance much except the color of his hair so I'd say Dope.

V - This boy is cute everywhere but he got me the most in [this](http://i.imgur.com/kcH3kgq.jpg) picture.

When I tap on the weekly top people I get amish mash of people with largely varying chemi beats and activities, some with high scores and lots of activity and some with a similar level and weekly visits lower than mine. So what is it based on anyway? Doesnt seem to be based on chemi beat itself since those with higher chemi beats are behind those with lower...


Also when I tap on them it says their ""chemi score"" is around 3000 and above usually. When I tap on my own level despite being on a same or even higher level my points are shown around 236. Is it the same thing? If not how can I view my ""chemi score?"" Thanks a bunch!",1,0

My dad once mentioned in conversation to him that I recently developed a huge interest in a korean band called BTS. I guess he remembered because he went back to Korea recently to visit his family and when he came back he got me  pt.1! It was a complete surprise and I wasnt expecting it at all! 

I want to thank him with a card. I wanted to thank him in Korean. [I used this to help me](http://www.wikihow.com/Say-Thank-You-in-Korean)	  

Since he's my dad's colleague and I've never actually met him myself I think ""kamsahamnida"" is most appropriate.
Is that right? And if I want to express great thanks for this should I use daedanhi gamsahamnida or kamsahamnida nmu? Are these phrases alone enough? Does anything need to be added. The card will be in English as well I just want to write the thankyou part in Korean.


Also another question. The hangul for kamsahamnida is  with  as ""ham"" but isnt  the b sound of korean? why is it an m sound here? shouldnt we use  instead? Thankyou!",6,7

Unfortunately you can only do this on an Apple device. 

But do not worry! Once you have purchased your pass you can login on android device and listen.

When you change your region you will have to use a korean address you can find one on google if you don't have any friends. 

Also you have to use a CC/Debit. U.S Region itunes cards will not work along with korean ones(because korea has none).

Melon App is pretty easy to figure out how to use. I have the 30 days pass that has 30 downloads as well. So your download counts towards digital sale as well as streaming if you are streaming on melon.

Info for melon streaming toward the ranking charts: Listen to 1 FULL SONG counts. No skipping. 1 listen full song count toward daily chart ONCE a day. 1 listen full song count toward REALTIME CHART ONCE every 1 HOUR.",0,13

**What's your favourite song?** I love a lot of the songs but I'll have to go with Ma City, its not only catchy, there's a lot of interesting stuff going on in there, the pre chorus vocals are amazing and the rappers have awesome flow as always


**For Which Song would you like to see a MV?** Not even sure if they'll have another MV for the album but they did with the last one. Honestly I was hoping that after an emotional MV like RUN we'll get another super fun dance MV like Dope, but listening to the tracks I think that's unlikely since the only fun songs are the rap ones and I doubt they'll get MVs. I think most of you would agree Butterflly is the most likely candidate but I wouldnt mind an MV for  either



**Favourite Part in the MV?** The MV was super cool, this might be an odd answer but my favourite parts were the close ups, like that part with Jungkook near the couch and the camera zooms on him then zooms out, or that part where suga looked at the camera and tilted his head. Something about it just looked really nice to me XD The underwater scenes with V were awesome too, especially when he looked at the camera in the middle


**Who caught your eye the most this concept?** My answer will always be Jungkook (obvsly) but other than him if I had to say I'd say V. Which is odd considering I dont like the green streaks in his hair, they look kinda weird imo but he still looked adorable in the concept photos, mostly his expressions. And like I said before the underwater scenes were really cool. Suga is a close candidate cus Mint Yoongi is fabulous. What I really like is that J Hope, who I admit never caught my eye too much before, is looking pretty darn awesome too this time around! 

Edit: After rewatching again, Jin caught my eye too. The focus was on him after all, which is a nice change, and the scene where during the first chorus part the cards fell and then jin looks deadpan into the camera, them feels man

Edit Edit: srsly tho jungkook is fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine


**Any Meh Stuff?** Im not feeling rapmon's pink  hair to be perfectly honest. And like I said, V's green streaks. Edit: I cant get into wahlien, but maybe that'll change after a couple of listens.",19,8
