seeing them perform answer: love myself and the long goodbye they give gave me chills. my sister was in tears after it all ended and said that BTS taught her to love herself.

listening to the song again makes me tear up. theyre such an incredible group of boys that i truly believe care about their message and fan base.

ive dealt with a lot of self-esteem issues and ive never thought i was enough for anything. its funny that my sisters love has lead me to loving myself more than i ever have.

I just finished up with shipping out all of the requests I got for the ,  exhibit last time I went, but because there was a larger demand than I expected, I had to turn some people down last time :(

Never fear, though, if you are still in search of ,  MD, because I'm returning to the exhibit on Monday, October 8th (and possibly the 17th depending on demand) and I'd like to be able to buy a few things for ARMY who wouldn't be able to get these goods otherwise. 

I have the unique privilege of being able to ship with domestic rates to the U.S. through USPS as well as through Korea Post for non-U.S. destinations. Therefore, the majority of listed prices ***include U.S. shipping***. I would encourage buying more than one item if you wanted a non-flat item (ie anything other than Live Photos or stickers) for ease of shipping, and I may be able to provide a small discount if you do so! For non-U.S. destinations please DM me!

I cannot guarantee with 100% certainty that any given item will be available when I attend, but I *can* guarantee that I'll do my best to procure what you request (I'm in line 2 hours early generally)! 

Also note that I have a few dollars service surcharge ($2- $5, dependent on order content) for taking requests to mitigate cost of entrance to the exhibit and the personal effort of aforementioned line-waiting haha.

***Unless otherwise stated, only 1 of each item is available.***

There were quite a lot of news reporters there, and whenever the line would stop, they'd come ask ARMY some questions with either a handheld mic or a camera. I always looked away whenever they approached because I had no idea what I would say. I've had some time to think about it though, and I think I would say this:

&gt; A touching moment for me was during the Wings tour. BTS each had their own solo songs just like the current LY Tour and when RM would perform Reflection, at the end when he said I wish I could love myself, fans would chant We love you! right back. Midperformance, he changed his lyrics to Yes, I do love myself. BTS always says that if they can lessen ARMYs pain from 100 to 99, then it makes their existence worth it. If they can make someone out there just a little bit happier, then its worth it. Well ARMY feels the same way towards BTS, and the fact that we could help Namjoon change his lyrics like that shows our unique relationship. Thats why ARMY runs charity campaigns, holds blood drives, and donates their time and effort to help spread the same positive ideals that BTS talks about through their music. Hopefully we can lessen the worlds pain too, little by little. 

So tell me-- What short segment would you say if asked about BTS?",2,1,False,self,,,,,

God I love it so much. How everything flows, the amazing choreography and creative moves that I would never have been able to think of. 

And since then I've been trying to learn their choreographies just for fun and it made me realise that I truly **love** dancing. (So thank you BTS for helping me find a passion). 

But more to the point, I've been learning the choreography to IDOL (I've learnt the pre-chorus, the chorus and the final (slightly different) chorus. And whilst I can't really tell if I'm doing it properly or completely botching it, I showed it to a friend and he said that I did it really well and it looked amazing so I think I must be mostly getting it right. 

My thing is that from what I've heard, IDOL is supposed to be the hardest choreography BTS have ever done and whilst I do find it very hard to do and took me a long time to learn, it doesn't feel like the hardest or anything. Compared to things like Danger, Fire and DNA it seems easy. 

I'm wondering, how hard do you think IDOL is?, What do you think is their hardest choreography? Also, is it too late to upload a #IDOLchallenge video? ",7,1,False,self,,,,,

BTS do so much to show their fans what's going on behind the scenes.
Wouldn't it be cool if the fans could collectively show them a glimpse of what's going on behind their scenes? 

Is something like that even possible in a fandom this big?

(not about shipping or any actual speculation of anyone's sexuality)",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9ky8uv/what_is_your_opinion_on_assuming_a_members/,Bex917,1538543505,"This is a question that really interests me because I've seen and heard people across the board, gay straight and everything in between, all have varying opinions on this. Basically, there are  two basic schools of thought. One which says that Bts' position as a famous group in a largely homophobic country means that fans should keep anything even vaguely gay away from the group to keep them safe from potential scandal. And the other says that gay people should be free to speculate and make edits of Bts members with rainbows and caption it ""gay king"" (sorry couldn't think of a better way to explain it lmao) as long as there's no immediate threat to Bts' image to the public in Korea.

On one end of the spectrum I've seen people argue that even something as harmless as waving a rainbow flag at a concert is inappropriate. And on the other end I see people argue that people should be allowed to speculate all they want regardless of the circumstances and even condoning official publications speculating about the members sexualities. Both of these examples are extremes but they illustrate both sides of the arguement I'm referring to here.

It's kind of a prickly situation because it should also be mentioned that a lot of kpop and kpop fandom is rife with queerbait and fetishizing of gay people (gay men especially). So personally it feels a little hypocritical to say that Bts should be kept out of everything controversial about the topic all while the majority of the fandom consumes and produces an enourmous amount of gay fanfiction and fanart, as well as containing a massive shipping community. As a gay fan myself I'll also say that there's a certain amount of frustration about being told we shouldn't ""assume their sexualities"" when this is often only applied to homosexuality. After all, no one has a problem assuming they're straight.

However, I also do believe that just wildly speculating about something like that on a big open forum (like this sub for example) isn't appropriate. I also think that it should be kept away from anything that has the ability to actually start rumors, like official publications or trending hashtags or big Korean SNS sites like Pann. However, I'm torn about where exactly the line should be drawn here. Because on one hand, it's hard for me to argue that a tweet on Army Twitter with thousands of retweets associating  members with homosexuality isnt as influential as many official articles. However I'm also reluctant to critisize people who do this, because I believe that gay people should be able to freely relate things to our own experiences, and I worry that shutting that stuff down would send the message that it's the gayness itself that is dangerous, not the homophobic reaction to it.

I should mention that this topic doesn't involve shipping or any actual speculation, so please don't turn this into a conversation about those things. I know this is a bit of a complicated one, but I've seen this debate rage on for so long and in so many fandoms that I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on it, given that I've read and had so many amazing and complex discussions on this sub before.

Obviously as an ARMY, this event is something huge for me as I've never seen them before and something similar happened to me the last year when I was supposed to go to the WINGS tour. 

I know my dad is being shitty, but there's nothing I can do about that. What I can do is try and convince him how much BTS means to me. I've tried over the last few days and I believe I am successfully convincing him. Is there anything I can say or show him that will make him understand or have empathy for how much these boys mean to me?

To ARMYs, does anyone else have a way I can phrase my love and appreciation of BTS that doesn't sound like I'm being ""obsessive"", ""shallow"", or ""desperate""?

BTS will have to start enlisting in the next few years and I am sad. Does anyone think Big Hit will start having them do individual things? I would like the members have individual activities to fall back when they are not promoting as a group.

I see artists from other groups shooting dramas, musicals and various other things when they are not promoting. I guess I worry that the boys wont have anything else to fall back on.

I've noticed on a big kpop forum I recently joined that a common refrain is that the HYYH series was better than LY. I feel the opposite but understand it's subjective; I just find the quality of the bsides are much stronger, and so many of them talk to me on many levels. (Euphoria, serendipity, Just Dance, Singularity, Tear, I'm fine, Truth Untold, Seesaw) Still, I seem to be in a big minority in this. The singles were stronger on HYYH, yes, but the final concept and the overall production in the end was not as unified in my mind. (All statements IMO!)

As a new fan, I'd love to hear people's opinions; mine might be colored by when I entered the fandom, and there's still so much I'm still learning about everything! What are your fave songs from either or both? Why?

It was hard but finally the campaign got worldwide retention, and had gained more recognition after they finally spoke at the UN Council. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those who have followed BTS before their debut, you have seen their ups and downs. You have come to respect them as they continue their journey and you know very well how meaningful and personal this campaign is to these kids.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a part of the Army but have followed the rise of Korean culture for more than a decade.  As someone who appreciate music, these kids aren't over hyped, they are not some Korean boy bands that creates nothing but noise. It's sad that some adults and young alike judge these kids easily because apparently, they don't understand the culture, language, their years of hard work and genuine love for music.

&amp;#x200B;

From their debut to today, a lot of their sounds have evolved but the messages has remained relevant, strong and compelling even to this day. It is safe to say that BTS have transitioned from young eager idols to a creative artists of this generation.  

&amp;#x200B;

And as they continue to climb the ladder of success, I hope that more people will acknowledge their hard work and love for music. There will be haters and bashers along the way, but you, the ARMY are the reason why they continue to create music. No matter how tired and physically sick they can be, they continue to push harder(a very Korean trait indeed), in the hopes that they can deliver more unabating music of tomorrow for you. Cheers!

We don't have a full summary of the September campaign for Namjoon quite yet, but it was great to see everyone have fun with the bingo and do little activities to help the environment!

Before we get into that, quick reminder about the food and blanket donation that we are helping with at the Citifield show for  ~~#~~**AnpanARMYxLYTour** **,** the posters were posted earlier, but more info about locations for donation collection [here](https://twitter.com/ChellszYuHurdd/status/1046875324225662977) and keep an eye out on our twitter and that hashtag as well as #AnpamARMYxCitifield as the concert nears.

Our October campaign is **#FlowWithJimin** for his birthday. This month, as a collaboration with Jimin Global, we are partnering with Mind Leaps, which is an amazing organization that uses dance to develop the cognitive skills and social-emotional  learning of at-risk youth to ensure they can succeed in school, enter  the workplace and leap forward in life.  Hence, MindLeaps! Currently, they are working in Rwanda, Guinea, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 

We choose this organization because dance is the reason Jimin found his way to BTS and it remains a passion and  fundamental element of his life. Jimin also has an incredible capacity  for kindness. In fact, Jimin's kindness made it difficult for the One In An ARMY team to  decide on a non-profit when so many fit his interests and loving heart.  But MindLeaps stood out to us because of their mandate. Not only do  they teach at-risk youth the joys of dance (and all the wonderful side-effects of dancing)  but their model helps youth succeed in education or employment and sets  them up for a stable future.

To continue the theme of kindness, our extra activity for the month is a 24 days of kindness challenge. Every day we are challenging people to do a small act of kindness for that day. We have created of broad categories of acts for each day, but people should feel free to be creative, we just want to encourage people to take a little time and spread kindness this month! Details for each day will be released every 12 am kst with info for the first days [here](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1047139070290382850). The full list of acts for the first week can also be found on the [campaign page](https://www.oneinanarmy.org/current-campaign) of our website

Im getting married this December in Sri Lanka. So, obviously its one of the most special days of life and I REALLY want to add a smidgen of BTS to make it even better. 

Background - Its in Sri Lanka where just 0.00000001% of the population knows BTS. Hence, I dont want it to be on-their-face big. We have just over 350 guests and the reception around 4 -5 hours. A live band will be performing. 

I was thinking of getting the band to play a BTS song. Thoughts? 

If you agree, **what song do you think would fit?** (Since they wont be singing, it will be an instrumental.) 

Any other ideas? 

Really appreciate your thoughts and ideas. I will definitely share whatever I end up doing. ",51,1,False,self,,,,,

This past Saturday, I went to BTSs Love Yourself Tour in Newark!

During the bloodbath that was ticketing, I ended up with a GA ticket.  I was really apprehensive about it at the time but I thought that I might as well give GA a shot.  Before the concert, I read up on anything I could find about being in GA, so I thought that Id add my experience to the mix.

I arrived in Newark on Thursday and decided that I wanted to try camping out Friday Night since I was really nervous about not being able to see (I'm 4'11).  I rented out camping gear (tent, tarp, sleeping bags, ground pads, camping chairs) through my college for the weekend.

Note: I knew people that had planned on buying camping equipment in Newark.  Id be cautious doing that  all the nearby stores were sold out of tents!

I got in line around 8am on Friday, and there were [~230 people in queue](https://imgur.com/ACmo3h9) when I got in line.  There were separate queues for Friday and Saturdays shows, and the one for Saturday was unofficial and so a lot of us were worried about if the Prudential Center would honor it or if there would just be a mad rush to get to the front of the line.  They did honor the unofficial line, fortunately!

People always give the advice to become friends with the people next to you in line, and I can confirm that you really really should!  The people next to me helped me carry my supplies when the line moved, and would watch my stuff when I needed a break or wanted to get something.

Lots of fans were giving out [freebies/fan project goods](https://imgur.com/a/Kl6HrQq) or were selling goods, including [pins, art prints and stickers!](https://imgur.com/a/r7OPDtL)  I kept an eye on the #BTSinNewark hashtag on twitter sorted by new while waiting in line to keep updated with what was going on.

There were lots of fansites who were [selling banners](https://imgur.com/a/IRd08uE) there as well  majorscale_kr,  hopesmiling0218, madein1997_jk, jinkiss, winterstrawverry, lookatmin1013, and jinkissletsgo are the ones I can remember.  I turned twitter notifications on to get info about when they got to the venue and where they were going to sell their slogans.

If you are camping out, an external phone power bank is critical!!  I borrowed [several](https://imgur.com/mr8I7xS) from my friends because I am a paranoid person.  I definitely had more than I needed but it was better to have too many than too few, so no regrets.

Sitting in line was pretty uneventful.  I had a book and a deck of cards (plus the internet of course) and all was good.  There were a couple reporters who talked to me in line, which was cool.  Some street vendors were selling [unofficial BTS concert shirts](https://imgur.com/BUAReSz) for $20 (cheaper if you bargained).

Some of the people ahead of me in line who had camped from Tuesday called ticketmaster and found out that their tickets were a scam :(  Fortunately they were able to find new GA tickets on Saturday morning, but I was sooo stressed for them the entire time :(

I was also really stressed about the line moving to the side of the Prudential Center after Fridays GA line moved inside.  At one point, there was a rush from the people in the back of the line and I just about had a heart attack since none of my stuff was packed up.  Fortunately they were sent back, but I never fully relaxed after that scare.  The Prudential Center staff honored the unofficial line and was AMAZING about moving the line and made sure everything was orderly, if a bit slow haha.

I only saw one group of people that straight up cut the line, but they went to the back after they were called out for it.  The issue was more with people who had friends that were already in line, which is a bit of a grey area.  Nobody likes it but theres not much you can do about it.

Sleeping wasnt too bad, I plugged in my headphones and was able to get a solid 7 hours of sleep.  The Prudential Center staff wanted all tents to be gone by 8am, and people were pretty good about that.  

At ten, we started getting our numbered wristbands, and my official place was in the 250s.  The line behind me had [grown exponentially overnight](https://imgur.com/Aj6CZsM)!! (video)

After getting the wristband, I was free at last from the queue!  I went to a friends place to shower and eat and prepare myself.  After a couple of hours I returned to the venue.  Everyone lined up according to the wristband order.

By the time I entered the venue, there were already 3-4 rows of people surrounding the extended stage, so I went instead for a [barricade spot on the catwalk](https://imgur.com/a/cRTAUSu)!  The spot was right by the catwalk's [side entrance](https://imgur.com/gallery/hXQZlyK).  Biggest shock of my life was when I looked over and Yoongi popped out from the entrance and was like, right there, two feet away from me.  The boys only used that exit twice to get on stage, but staff members and backup dancers used it throughout the show.

There were a couple staff members filming in the space between the barrier and the stage!  [One of them (on the right of this pic)](https://imgur.com/gallery/KUwRleE) was filming the [GCF uploaded yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zly9g6m6dkU) which was so freaking cool to watch.

After getting the spot, there was still an hour and a half before the concert began, so people around me squatted down in our spots for the time being.  They played a bunch of BTS MVs during the wait and everyone practiced the fanchants.

The concert itself was absolutely phenomenal, as expected!  It was insane being able to actually see them perform with my own eyes.  The boys walked up and down the catwalk several times and I just about died every time.  Tae sprayed me with water which was awesome!  Hobi was amazingggg with the fanservice, he even [filmed a selfie](https://twitter.com/sleykaloiseau/status/1046226843676938241) with the phone of a girl a couple spots away from me.  We all screamed when we saw the video was blurry :((( 

So, before the concert, my three main worries about being in GA was:

1. Being crushed against the barricade 
2. Not being able to see 
3. The noise

For concern 1, I was lucky in that my section wasnt really pushy!  Side to side it was like sardines, especially in the second half, but I wasnt ever pushed against the barricade.  I had a friend at the front of the extended stage who said it was really bad for her though, and she was really sore the next day from the pushing.  The people behind her were even pinching her to try and get her to move :(

For concern 2, my spot ended up being absolutely perfect!  Because I was at the barricade of the catwalk, I had a unblocked view of both the [main stage](https://imgur.com/gallery/iguQi4o) and the [extended stage](https://imgur.com/gallery/PxfA5VZ) (though I was seeing the extended stage performances from the back).  Not to mention all the times they [walked the catwalk](https://imgur.com/gallery/XHONfOX) and were like, right there.

For concern 3, I had splurged and bought a pair of concert earplugs and wore them throughout the concert.  They were absolutely perfect, I was able to enjoy the concert and the music to the fullest without fear of hearing damage, haha.

So long story short  My GA experience was incredible and amazing and I will remember it for the rest of my life.  Personally, I dont think Ill want to do GA again because of the stress of camping out and getting a good spot, though it super payed off for me.  It was so amazing getting to see BTS perform up close!!!

For an even more specific question I want to ask to non-korean speakers, that is those of you that follow kpop but do not speak or understand the language. 
Why do you listen to it? In particular what about the bands/genre appeal to you?

I'm willing to pay the full price for used products in good condition ($23 for the pouch, $18 for the keyring) and if it's new (like, never/barely used) I'll give you up to $30 for the pouch and $23 for the keyring (which is like a 30% increase in price) depending on how much shipping is.

This is my first post ever and turns out it is something pretty personal. I usually never show my writing to people, not even my closest friends, but I felt the need to share this poem inspired by BTS lyrics/words/imagery with other fans who will recognize all of the references and maybe connect with the message I was trying to convey. 

Personally, this poem has a greater resonance with me after today's (technically yesterday's) milestone at Citi Field. I wanted to share it with this sub as a thank you gift for being so supportive and positive towards each other and towards the group (huge shoutout to u/Valender70! Thank you for replying to me that one time I wrote on weekly/r/bangtan and also for encouraging me to post it here!)

Feel free to correct me for weird sentences (english is not my first language) or even send me ideas! I've been working on that last part for two weeks now and this is the best result I got so far. I'm not completely satisfied with it though, so I'm open to new ideas on how to end the whole thing. 

Enjoy and have fun finding all the BTS references! (Hint: every member has an individual reference)

 

To you

Who picked a wilting flower

And thought of it so beautiful



You gave a voice

To this nameless bird

You gave hope

To this world so blue



To you

Who trusted our happiness

To be written in the universe

Who saw me, precious as gold

When you yourself shined so brightly



There will be a time

When the whole world will seem dark and tiring,

When the shadows of expectations will weight your wings down,

On these days, remember my friend



Because you saved me

And now Im fine,

Because you ignited the fire

To the dreams I long buried away,

Because you made sense

Of my young struggles,

Because you simply gave me the best of me



I will stand beside you in your falls

I will help you repair your mistakes

And turn them into stars

I will celebrate with you

The constellation of your achievements



To the you of yesterday

I give my thanks

To the you of today

I shout my support

And to the you of tomorrow

I wish absolute joy



This precious soul of mine

Has filled with an ocean of love

From the stream of your blood, sweat and tears

It now overflows with light



Then in times of hardships

Please find strength

In these words of comfort

Remember them, they are yours

Only reflected through the heart

Of one in the sea of lives

You connected, through music,

To the most beautiful moments in life \~",21,1,False,self,,,,,

I was so unsettled after reading the article that I simply could not stay silent and decided to articulate my thoughts and concerns in a formal letter enforced by research pertaining to my current field of employment; it argues the potential harmful implications and impact that the published article can have. If you would please take the time to read over what I have composed and offer any criticisms, feedback, editing suggestions etc. before I submit my complaint that would mean a great deal to me. Considering that this letter may be erroneously considered some generalized representation of the ARMY I wanted to ensure that I am representing your views well. Here is what I have written:

""To whom it may concern,

        I would first like to extend my gratitude to The Times for deciding to include an article on Korean musicians BTS. It has been thrilling to observe their rise to the world stage, especially through the eyes of my ESL students who view the band as admirable representatives of their culture and notable writers that encapsulate their own experiences effectively through song lyrics. In short, they resonate with many young people today and I have witnessed firsthand their impact from the perspective of a Special Educator and ESL teacher. That is the foremost catalyst for my writing this letter today. I confess that upon reading Mr. Richard Lloyd Parrys article I had a distinct feeling of disappointment and shame. I know that some of my students have already read it, and when I think of how it will make them feel or think, I honestly feel ill. 

	You may be wondering what has provoked such a strong reaction in me. After all, were just talking about a boy band; a group of squeaky-clean young men who sing in Korean and have no time for girlfriends . . . coming soon to a teenage bedroom near you (Lloyd-Parry, 2018). From the very first rather snide line, the article showcases a bias that is at times rude, provocative and condescending. It became clear to me as I read that the author was perceiving the group through the stereotypical North American lens of what a boyband is. Through this ignorant presumption he proceeded to fail to identify the positive differences which makes the group relevant and unique in the eyes of their audience when compared to various other artists with their level of fame and influence. Aspects such as their creative input (the writing, recording, and composition of original music), notable charity work and integrated messages of self-love promoted by the group were left untouched and instead left to the wayside for such tabloid-nuanced explorations such as their dating and sex life, criticisms on Korean culture such as alleged plastic surgery and the vice-like control often exhibited by companies over their artists (I was particularly revolted by the following excerpt in which Lloyd-Parry crudely likens the idol selection process to farms, formed in large-scale factories that have something of the quality of industrial farms (Lloyd-Parry, 2018), and even the suicide of a Korean artist was inexplicably conjured to draw gross and over generalized parallels across the entire Korean pop music industry regarding the pressures of stardom facing groups such as BTS. Most notable were the distinct lack of resources utilized by the author to validate such egregious claims. I was quite frankly disgusted at the prospect of my students reading this and I could not in good conscience feel relief until I had voiced how unsettling I found this article to be; such blatant lack of professionalism and careless wielding of opinions without concrete evidence to back them up cannot go unchallenged. 

        Most disturbing and harmful of all the content in the aforementioned article by The Times was the segment in which Lloyd-Parry questions the intelligence of group leader Kim Namjoon and the validity of his IQ score of 148; this public criticism of his intelligence was drawn solely on the basis of his grasp on the English language: 

        the interviews were dominated by RM, the only band member fully fluent in English, 
        which he learnt from repeated viewings of the sitcom Friends. He does indeed speak 
        with impregnable confidence and faultless intonation, although (despite the claim of 
        my fan guide that he has an IQ of 148) his occasionally baffling syntax gives the 
        impression that he is channeling Joey rather than Chandler (Lloyd-Parry, 2018).

        As a special educator I must inform that those in my field of employment frequently work with ESL students, gifted students, and administer IQ tests regularly as an important facet of providing evidence for the diagnosis of various exceptionalities. With that in mind I cannot emphasize the importance and harm that the above criticism can cause. To publicly mock the intelligence of an important public figure representing and providing visibility to many ESL students and gifted learners across our globe is a shameful and baseless articulation of ignorance that has the potential to be damaging. I had honestly expected more from a journalist working for a reputable magazine with public visibility and influence such as The Times. This erroneous misconception that IQ is somehow the sole or most valid determiner of intelligence is one of the prevalent myths that continues to interfere with a full understanding of the various manifestations of giftedness and intelligences that can occur in individuals who are gifted without IQ being a determining factor of their intelligence. 

        Dr. Dona Matthews (2014), the founding director of the Hunter College Center for Gifted Studies and Education, City University of New York asserts that

	theres a dangerous but all too prevalent misconception that some people are born 
	intellectually gifted (while the rest of us are not) . . . Under this misconception about 
        the nature of intelligence, the best way to ascertain whether a person belongs to the 
        gifted category (or not) is to administer an intelligence test. The resulting scorean 
        intelligence quotient or IQis then interpreted as being stable over the persons lifetime 
        . . . however, IQ scores have little to do with working intelligence. They dont begin to 
        measure how effectively individuals adapt to different environments, how well they learn 
        from experience, whether theyre likely to invest the hard work over time thats necessary 
        for success, or how they deal with obstacles. An intelligence test score can reflect how well 
        a person understands complex ideas and is able to perform certain kinds of reasoning tasks 
        on a given test on a given day, but its not a great measure of that persons functional 
        intelligence.

        Psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman (2016) further enhances this argument by acknowledging that 

        the whole concept of giftedness was, from the very beginning of its inception, tied to 
        educational outcomes. When Lewis Terman invented the concept, he made giftedness 
        synonymous with high IQ scores, and linked it to high achievement (genius). A sizable 
        proportion of the gifted and talented community-- mostly clinicians who actually work 
        with such children on a daily basis-- fundamentally conceptualize giftedness as something 
         very different than high achievement, and often also very different from high cognitive 
        ability . . .there is not a single item on an IQ test that measures someone's capacity to 
        ""live and experience life more intensely . . . the field of gifted and talented education truly 
        wishes to broaden conceptualizations of giftedness beyond academic achievement, or even 
        cognitive ability as measured by IQ tests.

        The misconception that IQ is correlative with various forms of intelligence is one of the reasons why educators, parents, and young individuals themselves are unfamiliar with the nature of giftedness and frequently fail to identify it. Many gifted individuals remain undetected due to the prevalent idea that IQ is the sole measureable potential for intelligence. Giftedness still remains one of the least unidentified exceptionalities in special education. I wanted to make you aware of the harmful implications that such views propagated in your articles have the potential to do as you have access to many minds and have persuasive influence over them via your articles. Please do not regurgitate false ideas of how intelligence and IQ correlate, and please be especially cognizant of the negative impact that criticizing an ESL speaker and their intelligence based on their ability to wield the English language can have, especially without using credible resources to enforce such claims. It only serves to weaken the credibility of the reputation of your organization and everything it is meant to represent.

        Furthermore, I believe it to be offensive for a journalist to publicly question the verity of an individuals intelligence and IQ score on the basis of their handle on the English language; a secondary language informally taught to the individual in question by themselves. As recorders and orators of our current culture, a visible organization such as The Times holds weight and influence in what they choose to publish in the eyes of the world, and believe me when I say that young people will be reading this. I find it regrettable that The Times has chosen to publish an embarrassing and scathing evaluation of a visible ESL speakers capacity to utilize English and to use that as a vein to demean his intelligence.  I think of the students that I teach every day as a special educator and ESL instructor and feel ashamed by the knowledge that they may read this article and feel self-consciousness growing in their hearts from the implications. If Kim Namjoon, one of their hardest working international representatives on the world stage right now-- whose generous contributions to society and poignant messages that resonate with youth resulted in an invitation to speak at the UN this past September-- be bullied and marginalized with his intelligence questioned in the public realm for his grasp or lack thereof on English, what faith can my students have that they wont suffer the same scrutiny? These words can be interpreted and misconstrued in various damaging ways and The Times should be held accountable for publishing these harmful views to the public.

        I know that as you read this you may be thinking; seriously? It was just an opinion piece on a boyband. It really isnt that serious. But when I see the influence they have over my students and many young people around the world, I feel a sense of responsibility to defend the thoughts and opinions of todays youth and to see that their views and interests are respected. They have chosen this group to speak for them, so consider that importance accordingly. Please understand: this is the first time in history that Asian artists have had an opportunity to be heard by the world in this capacity; and with that they carry the weight of many of the hopes and aspirations of young individuals who are inspired by this flood of respect and attention now brought to their culture through the work of these young men. 

        I am not asking you to mute your voice. I am not requesting that no criticism of BTS or the nature of Korean Popular music be published. All that I ask is that when an article is put out into the world, knowing the influence and repercussions it may have on the young individuals reading it, think critically, enforce your statements with resources, and please respect your audience. Do not undermine the intelligence of the young people who take the work of these young men very seriously. Please do your homework with your assertions and offer sources to the claims made in your publishing; lend credibility to your opinions if you are going to publish accounts on the group as fact. If you are to publish words that will be read by many, do it from a place of research and credibility. I have come to expect a certain level of professionalism and fact-based journalism from your reputable magazine and this particular article was a profound missed opportunity and a genuine disappointment to start a thoughtful discussion with genuine criticisms on the current climate of the Korean music industry. Instead this article was flooded with incredible bias, rude commentary, alienating criticisms of intelligence based on IQ and the ability to use English as a second language, and claims put forward as fact without citation. 

        Please continue to offer multiple perspectives, criticisms, and unique lenses through which to view current influences on our current culture and the varied tapestry that makes it unique; but please do not do so without due diligence in research and respect for the young audience who will inevitably be drawn to your articles. 

Sincerely,

Michelle R.M. Rowsell

A wall of phones that people watched the show through and forced others to watch the show through because seeing past the un-moving limbs was hard. I'm a female of above average height, so I can't even fathom what it was like for the girl beside me that came up to my chest. 

It was sad to look around and see people that were sandwiched together like sardines (it was hard to move your arms or even wave the BTS bomb), standing so still and appearing to make little noise. I'd sometimes peek around and see mouths motionless as they recorded something they may or may not have been looking at with the naked eye. They could have just been in awe, but I don't know. I wondered if it was just that area or if it was expansive. I even wondered if the boys noticed from up on stage because I was only several feet from the stage by the end. 

I thought BTS was amazing. I still sang and screamed, I stood on tips toes, leaned, strained - whatever to try and get glimpses of them. I was thrilled to see them again. I was proud in that A.R.M.Y way that they were doing something so historic and happy for how much they seemed to enjoy doing the performance for us. I wouldn't give up the opportunity to be there for anything. Maybe it was just...surreal?

The floors were hard plastic. I thought in the beginning how that would sound with everyone jumping up and down and dancing, but that didn't seem to happen. I had the thought that it'd somehow be even more grand if it rained (atmospheric?), but after a point I just wanted the rain so people might scatter a little, it'd be cooler, and it could result in people putting their phones away.

I am 34. I guess I'm what one article I saw referred to as an ""adult kpop enthusiest."" Whatever. I'm a fan. I'm ARMY. They are a great source of my happiness. And I remember going to concerts as a teenager and how different it was without people recording. I get it, mostly. Visual memories outside of your head are nice. I have a handful of short videos and pictures from Newark (Note: I have zero from Citi Field once the show started) and I have appreciated a fan cam video now and then (BMA's Fake Love, am I right?). I can give credit to the idea that I can't dictate or know for sure how someone enjoys something, but it still seems weird. Just watch the damn show? You may not remember every little detail but the important stuff will stand out (Suga smiling during Seesaw when he listened to fans sing).

Name's Leah and I just turned 16 years old. I'd say I'm fairly new to K-POP in the sense that I've only recently been indulging in the different artists, but I've been at odds as of late. I listen to music as often as possible and have even taken up the piano because of my love for it, but have always been the kind of listener that will listen to one track or artist religiously and only say ""that was a nice song. Moving on!"" It has also been one of the many inspirations for my writing. But BTS was the first K-POP group I've been exposed to, and have listened to many of their songs through ""Blood, Sweat, and Tears""

Knowing this, seeing, what you call yourselves, ARMYs' devotion and passion towards BTS was kind of a breath of new and unknown air to me. I've never been as involved or as passionate about a group besides totally bobbing to a song and whatnot, so everyone's obsession with these boys was shocking to me. I listen to theirs and a select few other KPOP groups' songs routinely and have coincidentally learned each of their names, or at least their stage names. You can't avoid seeing videos of them when they're so viral and famous, so I suppose I've learned more about them and the fans unintentionally and without regret.

So I guess my final question is, knowing all this, should I consider myself an ARMY? I don't get all tingly at the mention of BTS or scream like I've seen some fans do, but I listen to their music frequently and have considered keeping up with news regarding them or maybe even their social media. At this point, should I consider myself an ARMY or just a curious music listener? Sorry if this wasn't the best place to ask!

During the VCR for J-Hope and JK, I asked them where they got these cool looking merch from (cause I was mad jelly, they looked amazing!) and they told me it was an official fansite good. Now I heard about fansites that are per member but I thought they were only giving us the good quality professional photos, I didn't know they sold bomb ass merch too! D: I feel so dumb and out of the loop because even though I'm a big fan of theirs (or at least declare it), I'm not a big social media person (I only have an instagram and a reddit account to my name :'D) to order these cool slogan banners or even know where to start. I don't know if there's an english site that I'm just missing or if there's a dummies guide book on buying (specifically) fansite merch.

Note: I was also told that fansites put that money towards BTS member's birthdays and such to support the guys!

The Love Yourself era is probably my favorite era and I love how all the messages aimed to incorporate the highs and lows of love.

Some people, after the UN speech, seemed to think or feel that Speak Yourself would probably be next, which is fine. Personally I feel like that sort of falls under the umbrella of Love Yourself and I don't know if it would be able to stand lyrically on its own, particularly to be long enough to cover an album. But maybe it will. That would be interesting to see.
As someone who has experienced a life by these lyrics (confused in high school, embittered by social norms, lost in my goals for college and work, looking for love but confused, finding love and still in turmoil, then finally realizing that I'm important and how I care about myself matters more than anything) I really want to know what they think.

I hosted a special BTS edition of the BUILD series here in New York City with two of the leading columnists who have covered the group. We discussed their entire career leading into the historic concert over the weekend and also answered some big questions surrounding the group right now and their future. Thought I'd share here in case you may have missed it or had any thoughts/feedback.

Anyways, today I went to swap out some of the batteries with another lightstick I had since I wanted to have fresher batteries in the other one, but when I was taking out the batteries the spring on the battery holder broke off entirely! 

Does anyone know if theres a way to fix it or anything? I doubt I could get it replaced since I didnt buy it from their online store and dont have my receipt anymore. The bomb did still work when I tried using the other sticks battery holder so Id also be fine with just buying one of those if anyone knows if those are sold anywhere thatd be great as well.

So now that they're RSPing to Award show invites, Son Sung Deuk (performance director/choreographer) has to be brainstorming their stages and how they're going to differentiate them/make them unique. They have less title songs this year than last, so I'm thinking they're going to have to bring in other tracks to fill it out.

 I'm personally pulling for Airplane Pt. 2, Anpanman, and a Save me/I'm Fine stage burner. If they do any solos or unit songs, Tear, Euphoria, Singularity and Seesaw would be amazing. (But hell I love them all so no complaints). The Truth Untold is one of my favorite songs ever, but it's a serious strain on Jimin and he doesn't deserve the stress.

\[Mods, please remove this post if its inappropriate\]

Im hoping to get US ARMY to encourage their fellow fans to register and vote in the Nov. 6 elections. To be clear, I dont think we should be telling people \*how\* to vote, only that they \*should\* vote. I truly believe this is a message BTS would get behindfrom RMs pre-debut Vote, or Just Shut Up to the Look, I voted! selfies they all posted last spring, BTS has consistently promoted the idea that voting is important. Traditionally, young adults in this country sit out elections; generally less than 1/3 of eligible voters between 18-24 actually show up on Election Day. I think thats because lots of people think that their vote doesnt matter, but there is strength in numbers, and voting can be a powerful way to make your voice heard. Again, I think BTS would absolutely support that message.

So what would be the best way to pass this message along to the fandom? My problem is that I have no reachI literally have only six Twitter followers and zero social media game. Im also sad that I didnt think to post this yesterday, as TODAY is the registration deadline in 14 states (AZ, AR, FL, FA, HI, IN, KY, MI, MS, NM, OH, PA, TN, TX)",0,1,False,self,,,,,

And this is on the heels of some comments from a few US radio DJs and fans in general becoming extremely frustrated with US radio despite all of their efforts to get the boys played.

On the one hand, radio still plays a huge role in making songs a hit. But in the other hand, since the dawn of radio, its been unbelievably CORRUPT. Even if you play their game, you can still not get played.

Just recently, Kelly Clarkson, called out iHeartRadio for not playing her music even after she played their music festivals and did a ton of radio promo for them.

And ARMY are getting fed up with getting used for their social media clout and not getting any results in return.

And, I wish I can remember the link, but this one DJ was laying out how your average Western Star has to put in so much work to get radio on their side. Doing interviews, playing their local shows, doing call outs, free tickets to concerts, etc...

And if thats what it takes (and there is STILL no guarantee it will get them spins), the boys simply dont have time for that. Not to mention being at a disadvantage with only one English speaker.

I mean, in the scheme of things, is it worth it? They got 2 number 1 albums without radio play. They sell out arenas and stadiums without it. They literally rule social media which is what most industries are obsessed with anyways.

Do they really NEED radio? ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

This announcement is a to tell you about some changes we have made to the [subreddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) as a follow-up to [this earlier announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9jrgar/180929_state_of_the_subreddit_reports_tattoos_and/).

#Tattoos

Based on the feedback, tattoos are now included in the list of casual content to be posted in the weekly /r/bangtan Room thread, and **wont be allowed** as individual submissions from now on.

#Bi-weekly /r/bangtan Room

Since the weekly /r/bangtan Room thread is getting hefty as heck, it will now happen **twice a week**. It will run on saturday as usual, and we have now scheduled another post for wednesday, give or take a time zone. Both threads function as usual and serve the same purpose  the other one may have a different name just because were being cute.

#/r/bangtan Room discovery corner

The weekly threads have an automated stickied comment up top. We encourage you to **reply to this sticky comment** with the fan content that dont have their own posts on the sub or get directed to the weekly thread. This way you can find them easily.

#Reaction videos

We have added the following rule:

&gt;**Reaction videos**: Reaction videos are only permitted with a comment describing why its noteworthy, educational or otherwise exceptional. The comment should be posted within an hour of the submission. Otherwise all reaction videos belong in the weekly /r/bangtan Room thread.

Basically: if you want to post a reaction video, be prepared to make your case!

#Frequency of content from the same author

To help alleviate the clutter of fan content, well be more strict with the frequency of posting content from the same author (whether its you yourself, or someone else). We have usually stepped in when the same authors content has been posted within a day or two, but **we will extend this cooldown period up to a week**. Compilations are always encouraged over individual submissions. We ask for fanartists understanding again  its nothing personal.

#Crossposts

Because of reddits [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) regarding brigading (heading over to another subreddit to cast inorganic votes or comment in bad faith, disrupting the usual flow of that subreddit) and the tendency to bring drama, **crossposting has been prohibited**. If you see BTS pop up some unexpected place on reddit, you can share a screenshot of it in the weekly /r/bangtan Room thread, provided it doesnt violate any other subreddit rules.

**Note:** if you see mean comments somewhere (be it reddit or another platform), telling everyone dont go read the comments is a good way to ensure everyone else goes and reads the comments too, and well all be stewing in a big puddle of negativity in record time. We have rules against bringing drama or bashing comments on the sub  please dont try to lowkey do that anyway.

#/r/heungtan

The meme/crack/showerthought/toenail compilation subreddit has relocated. Its rude to call someones precious memes shit, so theres now Fun to go with your Boyz instead. RIP /r/BTShitpost, **long live /r/heungtan**.

My girlfriend is an ARMY, and in the extreme. Idk how you rate an army's interest, but she spends probably 8 hours a day on BTS-related stuff. That's fine, it's just background info.

Here's my issue, and I'm hoping someone here will have advice: she shuts me out 100%. She actually said to me word for word, ""If you ever mention or even look or think about anything BTS related, I'll f\*\*king remove you from my life."" Is this like a possessive thing? I'm trying to be a supportive boyfriend and be interested and stuff but it's like a forbidden territory or something and it's legitimately disintegrating our relationship.

* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.

* I will post a new poll every **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Sunday**. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted. I try to post around **8 AM - 10 AM PST**. Sometimes it may take longer if I need to download and analyze the data when the vote is close or seems odd, or if my personal life intrudes.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

# Round 5

This will not include a photocard or the QR code survey card. This album sleeve also has the first edition misprint ( instead of  on the spine), and the corners are a little banged up from shipping (you can see the damage in the linked imgur album).

If you're alright with that and would like to enter, please leave a comment with a link to one of your favorite photos or videos of Bangtan! I'll choose a winner via random number generator around **5 PM EST on Monday (Oct 15)** and send a DM to the winner.

My sister has suddenly gotten ill, so she might not be able to go to the amsterdam concert with me tomorrow. She probably loves bts more than anything in the world so this sucks, a lot. But what also sucks is all the wasted money. We have GA (standing tickets), and I figured I might es well give someone else the chance to also see them. But I have never done anything like this, so I have no idea how. 

1. How do I find someone who wants a ticket?

 2. Is it too late now? 

3. How much should the ticket go for? I payed 190 for the ticket + 200 for flight and hotel so I'd like to be able to make that money back. Is 400 reasonable? I now that I've seen fansites pay way crazier amounts, but that might just be them. 

4. Isn't the ticket connected to a name (i bought it on ticketmaster nl)? How do I even transfer a ticket?

5. Is there anything else I should know?

Best case scenario my sister will wake up in a few hours and feel well enough to go tomorrow, but if she doesn't... :(

I'm not an ARMY by any means but these guys heights have intrigued me for a while now, especially since they have been on American TV for a bit too. I'm not here to offend anyone's idols, but I am good with heights and can clearly see these guys are not as they claim. We have a 5'8 James Corden who's probably 5'9 with shoes being just as tall and even taller than a lot of the members when he went around to high five them. Obviously it's super hard to judge them by photos or videos alone, but if you do not believe these guys are wearing lifts then you probably need to stop being naive and face a bit of reality. Anyway, here are my personal guesstimates and I would like to see what you ARMYs think. (This is a long one so hang on tight)

Order is from TALLEST to SHORTEST / HEIGHT MEASURED IN CM BAREFEET 

&amp;#x200B;

RM .   CLAIM - 181CM / GUESSTIMATE - 176-177CM

Probably the one closest to his claim. RM is consistently taller than all the other members and is well proportionate to someone that is 5'10-5'11, he doesn't even need to wear any form of lifts/elevators but probably adds an extra 1-2cm just for the gain sometimes. RM most likely wakes up close to 179CM in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

JIN.   CLAIM - 179CM / GUESSTIMATE - 175-176CM

Another one who is closer to their claim, similarly to RM he also has good proportions and doesn't need to wear lifts as many formalwear alone will make him close to his 179cm claim already. He is most likely around 177-178CM in 1 inch shoes and maybe adds extra insoles here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

JUNGKOOK. CLAIM - 178CM / GUESSTIMATE - 172-173CM

From JK below is where we start seeing a bigger gap than their claimed heights. I've seen multiple photos of him being way shorter than RM and yet he stands almost as tall as RM everywhere nowawadays. (NO he did not grow 5CM at the age of 21, jeez)  I have a friend who is 5'9 barefeet (175CM) and she was wearing Stan Smiths (1CM lift) when she saw BTS. She told me Jungkook was about the same height as her when she was there. Although it's hard for anyone to tell heights whilst standing in a crowd, that's just a bit of perspective from someone I actually know. JK most likely wears 5CM lift insoles. Body proportions are nowhere near that of someone who is 5'10.

&amp;#x200B;

V. CLAIM - 178CM / GUESSTIMATE - 170-172CM

Same case as Jungkook, around 5'7-5'8 barefeet but claims much higher. He is seen around the same height as JK but can sometimes be a bit shorter, however I don't know whether that's because he is shorter or JK was just wearing extra insoles on those days. He has better body proportions than JK but most likely adds 5CM lift insoles as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

J HOPE. CLAIM - 177CM / GUESSTIMATE - 168-169

Consistently shorter than V and JK, and sometimes even shorter. His proportions help him look the part of being 177cm as he has long legs compared to his torso but is not even close to being as tall. He is an obvious elevator user (Especially when it's formal/Smart shoes) but again his proportions help him A LOT, I might even give him a 5'7 (170CM). Most likely wears 5/6CM lifts and doesn't reach 177cm most of the times, but unless you have a ruler next to him you're not going to know at all.

&amp;#x200B;

SUGA. CLAIM - 174CM / GUESSTIMATE - 167CM

This guy surprisingly looks short even though he uses insoles, isn't close to a 5'7 flat and wears heavy lifts. There are photos of him being taller than JK when he CLEARLY isn't. Hard to judge his height because of posture but definitely shorter than 170cm. Most likely wears 6/7CM lifts at his highest and maybe 3/5CM more occasionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

JIMIN. CLAIM - 175&gt;173.6CM? - GUESSTIMATE - 165-166CM

JM I find the most funniest. His height gets downgraded but he keeps getting taller and taller on stage. Looks 5'9 next to Jimmy Fallon (5'11/ 181) but is obviously not anywhere close. Similar/Same height as Suga but wears heavier lifts. At many points he's seen taller than JHope, V, and even JK, which looks super weird because his proportions scream 5'6 more than anything. Definitely wears heavy lifts, around 6/7CM and sometimes elevators with insoles which boosts you to a peak of 8/9CM lift.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading if you did, I wanna hear what you guys think of my guesses, do you agree? Do you think they're completely off? One thing I know for sure is that these guys have definitely lied about their heights. Hollywood does it all the time too but never as drastic as the KPop industry it seems. Also I'm curious about you ARMYs, does having your idol be shorter than you expect change anything?

TL;DR

They ain't as tall as you think they are.

So in addition to BTSs TIME cover and being the first Korean group to even land a billboard magazine cover too which was an indication of many things prior to them being #1 on BB200 in May &amp; Aug, they did a lot this year already taking their bbmas performance into account as the first Korean act to perform at the BBMAs, first Korean act to win top social artist in general and then twice at the BBMAs, first Korean act/sometimes just first Korean group (depending on if PSY went already or not) to go on AGT (America Got Talent), GMA (Good Morning America), Ellen, James Corden, Jimmy Fallon, do NYRE, win an AMA, &amp; even speak at the U.N. 

They are also reported by CHARTDATA as being on track to becoming the best selling group and act worldwide for 2018. As of now given that UWC (United World Chart) combines a repackage with original album sales, BTS already have 4,000,000 sold worldwide with TEAR &amp; ANSWER, and to top it off they have also been awarded an Order of Cultural Merit medal from their country becoming the youngest receivers of that medal, they were chosen as Top Promoter of the Korean Language by The Civic Group Nations People Preserving The Korean Language, which is a new and special category, thanks to BTS impact. Additionally they were also chosen as the Metropolitan Ambassador for Seoul, and awarded the Sejong Best Korean Award for promoting Hangul worldwide which is determined by The City of Seoul and Korea Local Industrial Culture Association. The Impact is felt.

As you guys know from our previous announcement, the birthday projects will be printed as pamphlets from now on. This is to be able to ship our fan messages/art as letters (as long as it fits in an envelope, Big Hit is still accepting it). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding this new format do let us know! Again, this is the first time we print in this format, so we'd love to hear what your thoughts are :) 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, together, we were able to raise and donate **$90 USD** for the [LOVE MYSELF campaign](https://www.love-myself.org/eng/home/), BTS' joint project with UNICEF.

Thank you to all who participated and/or donated! We hope you guys enjoyed participating as much as we enjoyed organizing the projects for you guys.

Hello r/bangtan!! We have successfully closed the [JK + RM '18 Birthday Projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9nxxsz/closing_post_jk_rm_18_birthday_project/?) and ready to open the Jimin '18 Birthday Project, but first, some announcements!

&amp;nbsp;

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

If you are a newly subbed ARMY, or are rejoining us but it's been a while, let us update you on a few things:

&gt; The birthday books are a collection of fan messages and fan art created by our subreddit as a small way to show our support and love for BTS. To date, our community has raised over $1.8k USD for various charities, including the Love Myself campaign. See [all previous projects here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects#wiki_eng).

&amp;nbsp;

# WHAT'S NEW THIS TIME?

Earlier this year, Big Hit announced they would no longer be accepting gifts, only fan letters. Unfortunately, [our birthday books fell under the ""gifts"" category](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7u94me/fanclub_manager_rbangtan_books_classified_as_gifts/) so we had to make some changes moving forward; the biggest being the format of our fan letter compilations and, thus in turn, the length of the messages. We will be printing the fan letters/art compilations as pamphlets from now on. To get an idea of the end result, you can see the [JK + RM '18 Birthday Projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9nxxsz/closing_post_jk_rm_18_birthday_project/?).

**SUBMISSION FORMS** - The BTS Projects Team has made a custom Google Script to receive your submissions. In order to access the submission forms, you might need to click 'Trust App'. We promise we did not code anything malicious.

&amp;nbsp;

Yup, that's basically it! So without further ado, here are our the guidelines for Jimin's birthday project:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp; 

**Jimin's Project theme: Serendipity**

&amp;nbsp;

**GUIDELINES **

&gt; - The **theme is optional**; you can still send in normal letters and photos/art.
&gt;
&gt; - Only the message and credit fields are required. **After clicking 'Submit', please wait for the confirmation screen to appear to ensure that your submission is properly saved.**

&amp;nbsp;

**MESSAGE SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - You are allowed **1 message**.
&gt;
&gt; - Please limit your message to **500 characters** (about 80 words, or a really small paragraph).
&gt;
&gt; - **No inappropriate messages**. If it doesn't follow the subreddit rules, we WILL remove it.

&amp;nbsp;

**FAN ART / PHOTO SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - You are allowed **1 photo per submission**. Please, **no photo collages**. We want your photos to print clearly and beautifully so the boys can appreciate them. If you have a question regarding this, PM us.
&gt;
&gt; - Please include **self created** artworks and photographs only. If you didn't photograph or create it, you cannot submit it.
&gt;
&gt; - We recommend that the files should have a resolution of **at least 300 dpi**. This goes for photos, and digital or scanned fan art. We will accept the **standard image file formats (PDF, JPEG, etc...)**. If you have a question about the format of your submission, PM us.

&amp;nbsp;

**SUBMISSION FORM **

##[**Submit your Jimin birthday project entry**](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzn0MbTMPAQV8Pj3tfFaxJWeg7prhEwIpsL-vR6zF8/dev)

**Submissions will close on 22ND OCT at 11:59PM CST / 23RD OCT at 1:59PM KST**. You can use this [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to find out the exact date and time submissions close for your time zone.

We plan on sending the project by the end of October. We know it's past his birthday, but it's still okay. Since the boys are touring Europe at the moment, the fan messages will be there in Korea upon their return.

&amp;nbsp;

# CHARITY

This time around, we have two ways you can participate in the charity portion of the birthday projects. As always, we will be donating to the BTS and UNICEF [Love Myself campaign](http://www.unicef.or.kr/donation/en/index.asp). You may opt to donate through [the BTS Projects Team's PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Don't forget to specify how we should credit you in the comment section of the transaction.

If you would prefer to donate directly to the Love Myself campaign, but would like your donation to count under our subreddit's running total, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYzsA-58zbKmBm1B8B7sdyM1adGfRjq3jBvNf1OMXnvzr_VA/viewform?usp=sf_link) after donating. We will include you in the project credits as well.

We will be accepting **charity donations until around 25TH OCT 11:59 PM US CST / 26TH OCT 1:59 PM KST**.

Now for the second option! Keeping in mind that some of us might be on a budget ^(where my college students at?), we have decided to add [freerice](http://freerice.com/about) to the charity portion of the birthday projects, in conjunction with the monetary donation to the Love Myself campaign. With the freerice option, basically, you donate a few minutes of your time instead of money; you'll be asked some trivia questions and for each one you get right, freerice will donate some rice. Simple. If you joined us for this year's first annual MustServe, you are ready to participate! If this is your first time joining us, PM us so we can help you get set up with the rest of the r/bangtan freerice group.

&amp;nbsp;

Printing and shipping costs will be shouldered by the coordinators, but we will appreciate extra funds to cover these two projects. So, if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping, you can send it to us through [the team's PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs).

We want to be responsible with your money, and allocate it to the appropriate project, so please don't forget to specify the amount, e.g. ""$5 for charity and $5 for printing and shipping"" in the notes. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations. Also, if any money set aside for covering printing and shipping costs remain after the book has been ordered, we will put the remaining balance towards the charity donation.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

# ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING PARTICIPATION LEVELS

As many of you may have noticed, the RM mixtape series has had much lower participation than the previous album survivor series.

All possible reasons why may not be easily identified or addressed. Several non-album survivor games in the past year have also had only around 100 votes per round. People may not feel motivated or easily able to listen to and discuss ""RM"" as it's not been a hot recent topic for this sub or it's not their musical taste. There is a lot more content with the ongoing tour and the influx of new posts by a growing fanbase.

**Ultimately, the most important part of the survivor games is that the participants (no matter how many) are having fun.** I have added a question to this week's poll to check in on if you would like to postpone or continue the ""RM"" series. If postponed, I will post Round 6's results on Tuesday and begin the next series (Agust D) on Thursday. We can decide at a later time when to either resume or restart the RM series.

# GAME RULES

* As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.
* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.
* Choose wisely! **Your vote is final** and cannot be changed.
* I will post a new poll every **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Sunday**. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted. I try to post around **8 AM - 10 AM PST**. Sometimes it may take longer if I need to download and analyze the data when the vote is close or seems odd, or if my personal life intrudes.
* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""** and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

# Round 6

**PLEASE VOTE** [**HERE**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCLmc2IoJvnj-UuO-u1coPsgeK4Y3k2jYSAS8FEn3Lgr_TbA/viewform)

**You can view the current response summary by clicking on the ""**[**See previous responses**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCLmc2IoJvnj-UuO-u1coPsgeK4Y3k2jYSAS8FEn3Lgr_TbA/viewanalytics)**"" link after you vote.** You can see what song each pie slice stands for by (for PC) hovering above each pie slice or (for mobile) tapping on the song in the legend list and looking at what slice is outlined.

Please feel free to give me any feedback or contact me regarding any concerns (either commenting below or directly messaging me) :)

I've seen a lot of people on this sub for the past few days questioning where to get the new issue of Time with Bangtan on the cover, and I waffled around about it a lot but have decided to do a USA group order for it. I have access to a Korean address so I can purchase them from a Korean website and have them forwarded to me here in the USA! I've traded and sold on reddit before and previously did a mini group order for the Billboard magazines and posters, so I'm happy to have the chance to help out again.


Because group orders can be difficult and time consuming I'm unfortunately only taking up to 20 orders. If it goes smoothly and I'm able to get more, I'll consider doing a second batch, but I'll wait until this one gets going before deciding that.


A few things to note before joining this order:
* I am adding a dollar onto the base cost of the magazine to pay for shipping supplies. They're expensive! Other than that the price is very straightforward and I am not making any money from this.

* I'm doing this in classic Twitter group order style, so there will be **three payments**: cost of goods, cost of international shipping to me, and cost of domestic shipping to you. If you don't want to have to keep up with several payments, please don't join.

* **I do not know how much the international shipping to me will be. I'm currently estimating that it will be somewhere between $6 - $12 USD, and taking into account the cost of domestic shipping, buying a magazine through this order will probably end up being about $20 - $25 dollars. I'm sorry about this, and thought about not doing an order because that seems so expensive, but I'm sure there are some people who won't be able to get this otherwise and I like to help ARMYs with this kind of thing if I can! 


With that being said, [here is the link to my form.](https://goo.gl/forms/2vhJ9BGS4c4ObBzu2) Please read it carefully and contact me if you have any questions! I'll be leaving it open until 11:59 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Oct. 14, or until I get 20 responses. 

Thanks!

They are number one in iTunes in more than 65 countries, has more than 12 million subscribers to YouTube and is the first K-pop band to be at the top of the US chart.

&amp;#x200B;

They are BTS, Beyond the Scene or Bangtan Boys, the seven-member boy band from South Korea, the K-pop band that has conquered the world in the last year (they even appeared in the UN) although they sing mainly in Korean.

&amp;#x200B;

Gangnam Style in 2012 was just the beginning

&amp;#x200B;

K-pop was first born in South Korea in the 1990s as a mixture of western and Asian music and, in order to become a successful genre, it had to become international.

The first worldwide success of the genre came in 2002 when the young artist BoA became No. 1 only in Korea and Japan. This helped K-pop to spread across Asia and, ultimately, to the rest of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

But the planet really knew what Korean pop means in 2012, when Gangnam Style from Psy broke every record on the internet. In the beginning everyone took it for ... anecdote but eventually that was just the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

No band or artist has come close to the global recognition and popularity of BTS.

&amp;#x200B;

Music, interpretation, social media and fans - the secret of success

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to the Korean boy-band, the K-pop industry is worth millions of dollars today, with bands winning fans all over the world. It combines elements of R &amp; B, pop, hip-hop and rap - both in music and in the way artists appear.

&amp;#x200B;

It is known for its extremely flawless production, advanced and amazing music videos. Stylistic appearances and super-synchronized dancing figures are also very impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

Scooter o'brien, manager of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, explains on BBC: ""These impressive images allow fans who do not understand the language to understand the music.""



According to BBC, the success of BTS is due to music, interpretation, the internet and their fans: they have 16.5 million followers on Twitter and 13.5 million at Instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

The internet - and especially social media - has played an important role in their success. Suga, one of the seven members of the band, told BBC Radio 1: ""I think we are so lucky we were born at the right time, without social media, we would not be that successful.""

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018, BTS won the Billboard Top Artist Award in social media, leaving behind Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, guys! 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a GA ticket for the London O2 show on Wednesday 10th October. This was the first concert Id been to that I wanted to get as close as possible to the stage, so, naturally, I was terrified. Id searched a lot online and on this subreddit for tips on how to go about queuing and found some helpful things, but I thought Id write up a little list and explanation of my experience for anybody going to the upcoming shows and any future tours.

&amp;#x200B;

I did manage to get incredibly close to the stage. At one point, I made eye contact with Yoongi and I think thats my proudest achievement to date. \[Here are some of my pictures from the show.\]([https://imgur.com/a/RkQlYLG](https://imgur.com/a/RkQlYLG)) I was thinking of doing a full write up of my experience on the 9th and 10th, so if youre interested in that, please let me know. 

# In all honesty, the concert, as incredible as it was, was probably one of the worst experiences of my life. 

Some people were amazing (I befriended some people in the queue, and there were a lot of absolutely lovely people who gave out food and such), but it was very dog-eat-dog. Everyone was so desperate to get as close to the stage as possible, that they were willing to (probably unintentionally) hurt people in the process. I know that I was one of the people who were eager to get to the front, but I can, with confidence, say that I didnt once push anybody, while I heard a lot of people screaming PUSH THEM BACK PUSH SIDEWAYS ""MAVE THEM MOVE"" and generally trying to instruct people to be aggressive. That was not cool at all. In fact, Im pretty sure that kind of behaviour is what led to a lot of people having to be taken out of the pit. 

While I want everybody to have fun while at their concerts, what I want most is for people to **please be considerate of those around you. Please dont contribute to the reason why somebodys time is ruined. Please try to be as safe as possible.** 

And if being trapped in a tight spot, sweaty, unable to move your arms, having peoples limbs jabbing into you, having peoples hair in your face, and being used as a ledge for someone to rest their arm on while they record a video is not for you, either enter the pit a lot later than everyone else, or avoid it altogether.  

&amp;#x200B;

**1 GET ENOUGH SLEEP**

I got through the concert on about 2 hours sleep. Id also only had 3 hours sleep the night before because I went to the O2 early to get merch on the 9th. I was exhausted for the 12 hours that I had to queue, so much so that the 9th and 10th feel like a very long dream to me, and my memories arent quite clear. 

I thought that adrenaline alone would get me through, but by the time we entered the arena, I was almost delirious. It was almost like being tipsy; I felt like my words werent as coherent as usual, and my emotions were all over the place. It wasnt fun, especially knowing that I still had a few hours left before actually seeing the boys. 

After the concert, I was so emotionally drained and exhausted that I felt heartbroken and was on the verge of sobbing about how awful the whole concert was. 

I cannot stress this enough: please get enough sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2 CLEAN UP YOUR RUBBISH**

This one is just common sense. Im sure a lot of us have seen the state that was the Ziggo Dome. London, of course, was not much different. A lot of people = a lot of rubbish. 

At the O2 shows, a lot of people ended up camping in the nearby bus station, and it was *absolutely disgusting*. There was discarded bedding and pizza boxes, with litter strewn everywhere. The following probably applies to all of the upcoming venues and the fans attending: as much as I understand the desperation to be able to get as close to the boys as possible, just **clean your shit up**. Its somebodys job to maintain that area, and youve just made it unnecessarily difficult for them, not to mention how unpleasant youre going to be making the area for people outside of your OMG BTS CONCERT YAY bubble. 

If youve brought bedding with you, take it with you into the queue; its still going to be cold/uncomfortable there. If youve got food with you, put your leftovers/packaging in the bin. There are many bins around the venues like the O2. The bins dont close when the venue does. And even if you cant find any bins, at least put your litter into some kind of bag and take it with you to throw away once you do find one. Its common decency to clean up after yourself, so just do it. Leaving your gross, greasy pizza boxes with crusts and stuff in them is not cool. All of that nasty shit is a pest infestation waiting to happen. Just chuck your shit away. It is not difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3 TAKE MEDICINE**

I was very prepared with medicines, and took a pack of paracetamol (Tylenol) and ibuprofen just in case I got a headache or anything. I did end up with a banger of a headache at around 11am because of the lack of sleep, and sitting down on hard concrete for such a long time took a toll on my back lol, so the painkillers really did come in handy. I took some as a preemptive measure before the concert started, too, just because I knew it was going to be so loud. 

Thankfully, my head was fine during the concert, but my body was in pain for a solid two days afterwards. I was glad to have painkillers to take directly after the concert, which really did help on my journey home. 

Also  potential TMI  I sometimes get some bowel issues. I was terrified that I would need to go to the toilet during the final couple hours of queuing, or once Id secured a good spot in the arena. I took some over the counter loperamide (Imodium) tablets with me, and took a couple in the afternoon and just before going into the arena. I didnt need to go to the toilet at all, although this may be because I hadnt eaten a lot throughout the day, but it really gave me peace of mind to know that the tablets meant that I wouldnt get those stomach cramps from hell that would send me into an absolute panic. 

My asthmatic sister, who was with me, forgot to take her inhaler with her, and she really kicked herself for it. If you are standing and you are asthmatic, please, please, please take your pump/inhaler with you. Breathing, even for a non-asthmatic person like me, can get really difficult in the pit. There is a lot of awful pushing and shoving in the pit that will cause you strain, and if you find it difficult to breathe, you could very easily pass out. Countless people had to be lifted over the barriers because of fainting, difficulty breathing, and panic attacks; hauntingly, I even have some of these instances on video. If you have asthma, please make sure you have your appropriate medicine with you. The same also applies for any other kinds of illnesses/disorders that can be relieved with medication.

&amp;#x200B;

**4 TIE UP YOUR HAIR**

Okay, so this is one that I didnt see mentioned anywhere at all when Id done my research, but I personally think its super important. 

Id read some horrible stories of people whod had their hair pulled by people behind them trying to get them to move out of the way so they could get closer to the stage. I have very long, waist length hair that I tied up for fear of it being pulled by someone behind me, and I also thought that it would be more comfortable because of all the people and the heat. My sister and cousin did the same. We thought it was common sense.

Nope! There were a lot of women around us in the pit that did not tie their hair up. Quite frankly, it was disgusting. Dont get me wrong, some of them had absolutely gorgeous hair, but having strangers hair stuck in the sweaty grip of my inner elbows(?) was not fun. As I tried to reach up to record a video or take pictures, sometimes somebody elses hair would get caught in my wristband, or Id accidentally trapped a couple strands while holding my phone. Some women would flick their hair back over their shoulders and it would hit me in the face. My poor cousin, who is only 52, was stuck behind a very tall woman with very long hair. She was moving around a lot (completely understandable) and every time her hair swished, some of it basically ended up in my cousins mouth. Gag. 

I felt bad about accidentally pulling on peoples hair, but it really is unavoidable in the pit. There is not enough space to be avoidant of things like that.

So please, **if you have long hair, tie it up**. Not only will you be more comfortable without having it accidentally pulled or stuck to your skin because of all the sweating (you will be DRENCHED in sweat), it will be more convenient for the people around you, especially shorter people like my cousin. 

Also, if you can, maybe take some spare hair ties with you to give to somebody else; Im really wishing I did, for a poor girl whose hair kept getting caught on my wristband. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Again, I hope everybody going to the upcoming concerts have an amazing time, but please try to keep yourself and others around you safe. Safety is always number 1.

 BTS has become one of the biggest boy groups in today's modern music Era.

BTS was the first to make a breakthrough with KPOP

 BTS is soon to become the best boy group of all time

BTS is the most successful / biggest boy group of all time

BTS is the sole reason why KPOP strives in today's era of music

BTS has no need for improvement, they are fine the way they are

BTS has no need for a vocal coach their vocals are adequate and their techniques healthy.

Also has the incorrect character sleeve, and as noted before, the Survey Card lets you request the replacement. The album itself is slightly scuffed at the corners because it was shipped to me that way, so fair warning for those who want it in pristine condition!

# GAME RULES

* As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.
* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.
* Choose wisely! **Your vote is final** and cannot be changed.
* I will post a new poll every **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Sunday**. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted. I try to post around **8 AM - 10 AM PST**. Sometimes it may take longer if I need to download and analyze the data when the vote is close or seems odd, or if my personal life intrudes.
* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""** and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

# Round 7

**PLEASE VOTE** [**HERE**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffqUb6ZUqZx8Hx0eV_mGP_VPPI-M61xrJOpThdTkFHv9rD3A/viewform)

I am a brand new fan of BTS and have only really listened to the singles. Since Im a huge fan of listening to complete albums, I knew eventually I would listen to all of BTS albums for the first time. Just for some ground rules Ill be listening to the album all the way through three times (One time looking at the English translation) and then Ill write down my thoughts about each song, and then my overall opinion of the album.

Intro- 2 Cool 4 Skool: Pretty cool beat, great intro to the band. Not sure what else I can really say about it except for I love how clean and put together the production is.

We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2: Heard this song before, definitely made better by being placed after the intro, I love that the rap line all gets a chance to kind of tell their stories. I especially love Jungkook and Sugas verses here.

Skit- Circle Room Talk: Not much to say. Love Vs My mouth hurts bit. Im not sure if skits are common in Kpop but it almost reminds me of Eminems skits just kind of loosely tying into a storyline.

No More Dream: I cannot stress how much I love the bass line on this song. The beat here is fantastic. I absolutely love the old school meets new school feel the song has. It definitely gives me Dont Sweat The Technique by Eric B and Rakim. The lyrics are very relatable to teens I think, and definitely express the pressure to be academically perfect in society quite well.

Interlude: not really a song, but a nice transition

Like: I really really like this song. I love the beat and the hook is great. Very nice song about love in the 21st century. Not sure what else I can really say about it lol.

Outro- Circle Room Cypher: Wow I really love this song. it really shows off just how talented they all are. Im not sure if that was an actual freestyle rap by any of them, but even if it wasnt it is still really cool. The whole rap line proves how much they all deserve to be there. I love hearing their reactions too its very funny, I love how they all took the beat and did something different with it. I love Vs verse just because after not really hearing him on this album at all it was very cool to see he can definitely rhyme on beat too. V is probably my bias though so take that opinion with a grain of salt lol.

Overall thoughts and review:
Great first release from them. Very very very rap centric so if you dont like rap this might not be the best album for you, I wish there was more then just four/ five actual songs. This really shows me that I have a ton to look forward to! They really came out of the gate very strong. I find the hip hop club concept a little bit cliche but honestly thats understandable I think. Overall I am very very impressed with this album and I cant wait to listen to their other albums.

A Noobs Rating: 7.5/10

So thats gonna wrap it up for today! Hopefully you enjoyed this. Look for A Noob Listens to O!RUL8,2? For The First Time Tomorrow!

I found a review about the first Berlin show and thought, some of might be interested in it. RBB is the public service channel for Berlin and Brandenburg. 



**The big we feeling**

*The Korean band Bangtan Boys showed on Thursday at the Berlin Mercedes Benz Arena how todays popmusic works. Fans camped for days in front of the arena to see the seven boys. At the end there were tears. By Regina Lechner*

For many visitors this has been the first concert of their life. They traveled here with mother or father, because they arent old enough to see the performance on their own. Some spent hundreds of euros for one evening, for flight, hotel, ticket and of course merchandise. For those who love the Bangtan boys, short BTS,  for them its worth it.

Since Saturday the first fans waited in front of the Mercedes Benz Arena to stand in the first row. On Thursday night its finally time  and on Wednesday there will be another concert. Both are already sold out, just like the rest of their Love Yourself Tour around the world. BTS is a phenomenon which goes far beyond Korea. 

**The language is secondary**

Part of this is that the seven boys not only sing in Korean, but also use a couple of English lines. Fake love, Idol and again and again lets go: Everybody understands this, great English skills arent necessary  and the message becomes clear through the music and performance.

Actually, the recipe for BTS is a bit too easy: handsome boys who can sing and dance well  which they do in live and colour. But Fans always emphasize that the lyrics and messages in the songs are, what makes BTS so unique. And so the audience sings not only along the catchy phrases, some are even singing the Korean rap parts.

**Love yourself!**

The songs revolve around themes such as self love and dealing with depression and angst. But the boys also know how to party. Their music is a mix of typical boygroup pop, electronic dance music and rap  the korean supergroup covers several music tastes.

For their entertaining stage program, they use confetti canons, bubble machines and fog machines. The rebuilding times are often long. Meanwhile the screens show clips with the Members V, Suga, Jin, Jungkook, Rm, Jimin and J-Hope for the 17.000 visitors. The  huge projections are enough to make the young girls scream. 

**We are a family**

But truly special about BTS is, how they are emphasize their closeness to their fans. They also show this through social media, which is probably a big part of their success. But it truly shows during their live show. After the first song all members line up to speak a short message to the fans. 

They emphasize how much it means to them, that so many people came. They say that the fans are close friends, almost a family. All seven learned Guten Abend (Good Evening) in German and are probably happy about the applause for it. At the end the same: For a couple of minutes  each member recalls the evening and tells a personal story and how excited they are about the next concert in Germany. 

**The concept works**

For the last two songs they put aside the ever changing glitteroutfit for jeans and a white shirt, just quasi from Superman to Clark Kent. Its A.R.M-Y-Time: The songs are for the hardcore fans of BTS. The band named their fanclub A.R.M.Y (for Adorable Representative MC for Youth). The normal outfits are making it clear, we are like you  and together we are family. 

This concept works. Many visitors leave the hall sobbing. Its tears of joys. In front of the arena people gather around. BTS songs are played and sung loudly, many dance the choreographies. And again: a big we feeling. ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

To be honest, I didnt really have any ambitions before learning about BTS and falling into this ~~pit of madness~~ wonderful fandom. Somehow, they inspire me to set some goals for myself, and I thought I would share them here. I havent done much with these goals thus far other than roll them around in my head, so maybe its time for me to actually attempt them, even if I fail at first. Also, I figure that at the end of 8 years, I should succeed at or be pretty good at whatever I attempt, provided that I consistently work at it. Heres some of my potential goals:

* Learn a language (probably Japanese or Korean)
* Travel to Japan (Ive been wanting to go there for a while, but never seriously considered it)
* Learn to draw (my ultimate goal would be to get really good at drawing BTS, but Im fine with just getting better at drawing in general)
* Make some more friends (preferably ARMY friends ~~so I have someone to fangirl with~~)
* Buy some BTS merch and wear it around/display it (in the hopes of attracting said ARMY friends, lol)
* Go to a BTS concert (provided that BTS still plans to tour in the USA in the upcoming years)
* Learn to truly love myself (a constant work in progress, tbh)

Yeah, I know, most of them are BTS related, but considering that I attempted to kill myself earlier this year because I had nothing to live for, I figure that I owe BTS a lot. Obviously, they arent like mind-blowing or lofty goals, but Im fine with that for now.

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a 20s/30s meetup after watching Burn The Stage The Movie in NOVA. It's playing at  the Angelika Film Center and tickets are on sale at Fandago. I saw on another thread that there are a good amount of ARMY in the NOVA area, but those that are in their 20s and early 30s have had a hard time making fellow ARMY friends. Myself included. I feel kind of awkward trying to make friends with fellow ARMY because I am unsure of their age. I was thinking since the showing is from 11-12 that afterwards we could get a group together and eat/get drinks at a place at the Mosaic for lunch. I've already got a ticket, so I will definitely be there. And, if any one can't get tickets for the movie at that time then you are still more than welcome to join in lunch. If this post is against the rules then I'm sorry and pleas remove it. 

I would really love to make more ARMY friends my age in the area, and I thought this would be a good opportunity. Please let me know if you are interested! Thank you :)",21,1,False,self,,,,,

For The First Time",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9p8k03/a_noob_listens_to_orul82_for_the_first_time/,Peepzilla,1539863655,"Hello ARMY! Welcome to the second part of my A Noob Listens.. series. Today Ill be listening to O!RUL8,2? Im not going to do another pre-rambling here but if you want to view my methods you can check out part 1.

Intro- O!RUL8,2?: Very interesting intro, definitely right off the bat feels more epic in terms of scale then the last release. I love the message RM is talking about here.

N.O: Ive heard this song before but I think its made better by being after the intro. I love the message about how possessions dont necessarily make you happy. This is interestingly quite the contrast to all the flexing they did on their last record.

We On: Okay scratch that cause theyre right back at it with the flexing here but this diss track is pretty solid. The beat is very late 90s/ early 2000s in the best way. Definitely another solid track. I think the vocal line steals the show here however, as the chorus was definitely the most memorable for me

Skit-R U Happy Now?: This doesnt feel nearly as staged as their skit on their debut. Its pretty funny too. Favorite line goes to RMs listening to the song makes my bladder tighter pretty interesting overall. Id still like to know if skits are commonplace for kpop albums since they really arent here in the US.

If I Ruled The World: Very funky beat, I love the hook. Not sure what west side theyre referring to though lol. Love their anti racism line here. This song feels extremely mid 2000s which isnt necessarily bad, I just think the sound hasnt aged particularly well. Love the bass synth here though!

Coffee: This song is super adorable and I think Im gonna add this to my playlist I made for my Girlfriend. Also definitely has that early 2000s boy band sound but it somehow works here. I really love the R&amp;B elements here. Jungkook does a really excellent job on the chorus holding it together even when the other members of the vocal line switch up. I love all the coffee related lines here and I think it really works somehow.

BTS Cypher Pt. 1: Wow RM can really spit some bilingual fire here. I definitely think it comes off a little cocky but those were clearly the characters they were supposed to be portraying at this point.

Attack On Bangtan: Wow right from the start I can tell you right now this is my favorite song on this album. I f&amp;%king love this beat. The production is so buttery and nice. Everyones verses are tight and clear. The hook is incredibly infectious and really stands out on this release.

Paldogangsan: Oh wow.. might change my mind on that. I love the horns here and I think they really add something special. This album is definitely back loaded. I cant in good conscience not comment on the MLG air horn sound effect you can hear occasionally.. its so wonderfully extra. Also damn what an infectious hook here. For some reason I get mid period Tyler, The Creator vibes here.

Outro- Luv In Skool: traditional boy and sounding number to finish it off. Definitely helps connect the storyline into one cohesive story for me. Great hook. Another one I might put on the playlist for my Girlfriend.

Overall Feelings and Review:
I just want to quickly say it took me way longer then it should have to realize that the title of this album was actually Oh! Are You Late Too? Sorry Im a bit ditzy sometimes lol. I think overall this album shows a very strong progression from their Debut release, however it is very much a transition album from what I can hear. It incorporates a lot more singing and I think it really sounds much more like the BTS I know from the singles Ive heard, however, I think its missing a lot of the character their debut had. However, some of the individual songs like Coffee, Paldogangsan, and Attack On Bangtan are absolute standouts here. I dont want to absolutely tear this apart by any means, after all, Jin was only 22 at the time I think. (meaning they were all literally babies) However, I dont think this album seems as timeless as their debut, maybe its just because the rap centric sound is extremely in right now. I however definitely enjoy this record and will definitely return back to it after this journey is over.

A Noobs Rating: 7.25/10

Thanks to everyones great response on my last post! Stay tuned for A Noob Listens To Skool Luv Affair For The First Time tomorrow!

After lurking for a thousand years on this sub, I finally decided to join. But that's not the point of my post (but nice to meet you all, tho!).

Actually, I'm a French ARMY and I've just bought my ticket for Burn The Stage. I don't know if there are many other French ARMY here, but just in case: if there is a cinema in your city, go on their official website and look for their future releases (or "" prochainement ""). If your cinema releases it, maybe you can already buy a ticket just like I did.

By the way, there's only one screening (on November, 15th), the ticket costs 12,50  (I don't know if the price is the same in every city or if it's more expensive in Paris, for example), and the screening is at 19h30 (and the movie ends at ~ 21h15).

Lastly, the cinema I go to isn't a Path one (I think the movie is distributed by Path but it can be released in Path cinemas and non Path ones (... not sure if what I just said makes sense)).

* **Rank your top ten BTS songs in an ordered list.** If you're having trouble narrowing it down, [give this song sorter a try](http://strawbrrytaehyung.tumblr.com/btskdisc). Feel free to talk a little bit about your favorite songs and elaborate on your list too, if you'd like. 
* **Below your list, write down the era in which you became a BTS fan.** Eras should be as follows (please do not deviate from these):
   * **Pre-Debut Era**
   * **School Trilogy Era**
   * **Dark &amp; Wild Era**
   * **HYYH pt. 1 Era**
   * **HYYH pt. 2 Era**
   * **HYYH: Young Forever Era**
   * **WINGS Era**
   * **YOU NEVER WALK ALONE Era**
   * **LY: Her Era**
   * **LY: Tear Era**
   * **LY: Answer Era**
* Your #1 song will get 10 points, your #2 song will get 9 points, #3 gets 8 points, etcetera. All the points for each song will be added up.
* *Do not rank the songs in reverse order.*
* Original Japanese songs are eligible. (Japanese remake songs are not.)
* Original Soundcloud songs/remixes are eligible.
* Mixtape songs are eligible.
* Song remixes will be counted as separate tracks.

#  BEFORE YOU COMMENT:

**When creating your ranking, you absolutely must COPY AND PASTE song titles** [**from this list**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSBFbPXQSXLMFyYK8O0LOyLGCMJPqDuMCAhkrc5LIhh9vu4J8tgOrwXkRDSZVvxDvXpXMPycf6b9gVA/pubhtml#) to ensure that there are no naming discrepancies. (e.g. ""Blood Sweat &amp; Tears"" vs. ""Blood, Sweat, and Tears"" or ""Cypher Part 3: Killer"" vs. ""Cypher Pt.3: Killer"".)

If you refer to a song NOT by the title on the listpunctuation matters, fyi**your submission will likely be disqualified**. I wish this wasn't the case, but excel is very inflexible and we've got to keep our data clean!

I really hope everyone is well! T-T  
I'm abroad studying in Korea and had someone on the good old bird app request I pick these up. They blocked as soon as I sent proof photos, rip. :')  
I can't really afford to keep the squishy dolls as cute as they are and have an exhibition photobook myself, so if any of you guys would be willing to take these off my hands I'd be greatly appreciative!  
The book is $80 and the dolls are $55 each which includes shipping/tracking. I can do combine shipping if you're interested in two dolls ($100), the book and a doll ($125) or all three ($170). The university I'm attending has a post office, so I can sneakily drop these off before the weekend if there's interest. :')
[Here are the photos!](https://imgur.com/a/8ctpiud)  
  
thanks all. love you so much. ()  
also, if you ever get the opportunity, please visit Korea. I'm sure it's on a lot of people's lists here, but if you're on the fence don't be! It's a really lovely country. I've been a sheltered soul my whole life and this was my first experience outside of my country (state too!). I was a bit fearful of the culture shock but there wasn't much, or even any at all. It's comfortable(?) here. Not sure if that's the right word but it's not stressful and you don't really get scared if you're lost or confused; this is coming from someone with high levels of anxiety. You don't have to be, it's very safe and folks won't mind helping a confused foreigner if you ask nicely. Did I mention the safety? Anyways I'm rambling, sorry.

* Namjoon's ['I don't know, nan molla'](https://twitter.com/H0NGJOONG/status/1049157445661028353) getting the loudest chants at concerts despite not being an official fanchant.
* J-Hope's American alter ego, Jay.
* When we thought Namjoon was wearing a [male thong](https://twitter.com/SinBst/status/1009088864684789760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1009088864684789760&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.koreaboo.com%2Fstories%2Ffans-claim-bts-rm-wore-male-thong-stage%2F).

Does anyone know what the situation behind Taehyungs siblings/family is? I know he has a younger sister and brother- and though there are rumors concerning their ages no one actually knows how old they are. And hes mentioned before that he was basically raised by his grandparents for around 14 years (though I had always assumed he meant that his entire family lived together with the grandparents.) 

Ive been combing through some of their old interviews and even when the group is directly asked about siblings-he keeps pretty mum about them. Granted, Im not a social detective or anything so I wasnt digging too deep lol the most I could find on the subject is buried in an old solo vlive Tae did back in the DNA era. Someone in the chat asks about his siblings and he admits that he doesnt talk to either of them too much and divulges that he cant remember the last tile his sister called him Oppa (older brother). However, whatever he was about to say right after he mentions them he cuts off ah, whatever and then changes the subject. 

Granted, this could all mean nothing. He may have just found the subject boring or figured that since its none of our business he didnt want to get too personal. And again, as far as I know hes never said how old they are so maybe theyre younger than we think? 

W/ nearly all BTSs siblings attending their London concert it just sort of reminded me that V never talks about them- not even in the little ways the other members talk about their siblings 

So I just wanted to see if maybe I missed something haha its not too big of deal or anything. They may just not have that sort of relationship with their brother, or perhaps theyre private people like RMs sister and JMs brother.

BTS made me less shy.  I, like the younger Jungkook, am horribly shy.  Recently I watched Celeb Bros, which documents Jungkook hanging out with his Shinhwa mentor, Minwoo.  Early on, Minwoo acknowledges Jungkook's shyness and gave Jungkook straight-forward advice on being social: ""you just need to do it: \[talking to strangers\] will FEEL WEIRD at first.""  I thought it was crucial to acknowledge that it WILL feel weird when meeting new people!  If you acknowledge the weirdness, you will be able to overcome it, instead of letting the feelings of weirdness and social anxiety overwhelm you.  And in most situations, once you get started, the weirdness becomes fleeting.  

Throughout the series, Jungkook reveals his fearless attitude about trying new activities: ""I tell myself I CAN do things I've never done before because I don't want to let myself down.""  Note that he didn't say ""I don't want to let OTHERS down."" Oftentimes, I am so worried about how others might perceive me, that I don't focus on my harnessing my own willpower to push myself to new heights.  Jungkook helped me focus on my own progress and goals, rather than living by someone else's rules.  

So how did I put this into practice?  Recently at Dolores Park, I watched two guys walk on a tightrope for a good hour. There were hundreds of people at the park, and we were all watching these guys. Despite never having met these dudes before and having terrible balance, I mustered up the courage to talk to them and ask if I could try their tightrope out!  I was able to take some baby steps, which was way more satisfying than watching them wistfully from a distance.  I felt like a kid again in that moment.  Thank you Kookie for the inspiration!  

Much love everyone!  ",39,1,False,self,,,,,

I am a Korean, now living in Canada, and I would like to share with you in what ways BTS has shaped my way of thinking and life.
So as a someone who is Korean, I grew up with a lot of pressure in my house. My parents were very strict during my early-teenage years and I had an older brother who set the bar extremely high for me. The pressure I felt while facing academics was extremely high, and my social life wasn't the best, as it was hard for me to make and keep close friends. Because I did not have too much to turn to under pressure, I would always try and look out for new music, whether it'd be kpop, or NA pop. The method of which I found the 'Bulletproof Boys' isn't exactly a nice one to hear:

In the Korean community back then, BTS was not well known and kind of laughed at by fans of kpop. Even some of my friends commented how 'gay' BTS was (they were of course joking. they jokingly said this after seeing Jimin lift his shirt in No More Dream, without any homophobic intentions). I was curious as to why BTS was bashed on so often that I went to check out their album and music videos, AND I LOVED IT

I listened to No More Dream, and I thought it was funny, corny, unique, and great hype style that no other kpop groups ventured into. But more importantly, I loved the message of No More Dream, as I was someone who felt lost at what to do regarding my future, and felt pressured by the criticisms of others regarding my future.

Along with No More Dream, I listened to Boy in Luv (still my favourite BTS song BY FAR) which lightened up my mood whenever I felt hurt by a girl, Bapsae, We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2, and loved the message they conveyed. It really helped me from when I was 13 to even now, helping me feel significant as not only just a human being (as their current songs try to convey), but also as a teenager, as a member of the upcoming generation.

I've strayed away from BTS and started listening to other groups like EXO or Twice (fun fact, their debut day anniversary is tomorrow, Oct 20th, which  also happens to be my bday hehe), but I will never forget the impact they had on my youth years. Whether it was from Boy in Luv helping me feel better about my romantic life or even Blood Sweat and Tears talking about the dangers of sweet yet dangerous temptations, BTS has really helped the young me grow and realize the self-importance as a teen, and I'm glad to see that they are influencing the world with their great lyrics. I'm glad that I started listening to these boys right from the beginning.
 
Sorry for anyone who actually read through this, and pls tell me about how BTS changed your life!",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Welcome to the third part of my A Noob Listens... series. Today its Skool Luv Affair and I am very ready for it! So without further ado I want to just jump right in. (Also Ive determined that I am going to write my train of thought as I listen, rather then afterwards, just thought Id disclose that in case anyone was wondering)

Intro- Skool Luv Affair: This is really cool intro to their personalities, up until this point I feel like besides the skits its hard to tell what theyre like outside the recording studio, but I think this really shows you the three distinct personalities of the rap line. I love j-hopes verse here, but I also really love Sugas lyrics, it reminds me of the darker lyricism of the singles from Wings.

Boy In Luv: This is such a cool beat honestly I absolutely love it. I love the hook from V here. His vocal inflections are very very powerful. The contrast between the happy verses and the very dark sounding choruses is very cool. I also love the rock sound here.

Skit- Soulmate: I couldnt find a translation so I have literally no idea what theyre saying but it sounds like its funny?

Where You From: You look fresh like a salad I LOVE THAT LINE MORE THEN I LOVE MYSELF. Also Im so glad to hear way more of V here as Ive decided he is definitely my bias. Although this salad line might make Suga my bias wrecker. The bubble instrumental is pretty cool and I love its jazzy flavor

Just One Day: Oh boy this song had me ready to grab a tissue at first but the beat kicked in and I think Ill survive.  I once again think Suga steals the show here. His flow is great on this track. RM continues to prove why he used to be called Rap Monster.. he slays.

Tomorrow: Damn this song hits me right square in my feelings. The lyrics are so relatable. RM has the best verse here I think. His flow is fucking masterful here.

BTS Cypher Pt. 2-Triptych: Holy fucking shit RM is a fucking incredible MC. He seamlessly switches languages throughout his verse and It made it actually understandable on the first listen for me. I love J-Hopes hook here, its very memorable. Suga is seriously such an intense rapper I absolutely love it.

Spine Breaker: Damn Suga rapping about economic inequality up in here, I am fucking living for it. I cannot stress how much I love the beat here. V is perfect perfect person to handle the chorus here. He sounds like a Korean Nate Dog and it really help this song work. Definitely one of my favorites

Jump: I love this group effort here, It definitely feels more BTS to me, with having them switch up whos singing or rapping more often. It kept me very engaged. I also loved Vs chorus.

Outro- Propose: Yikes that mic feedback sound made my ears hurt. I love the opportunity the vocal line gets to show off their talent here. Jimin really shows off his range here.

Miss Right: This song is adorable and also probably going on my playlist for my girlfriend. Its a big bop and I can imagine this song getting stuck in my head

Overall thoughts:
Wow this album really blew my away, after their last release, I wasnt expecting anything like this album but I absolutely love it! I think it is my favorite Ive heard so far! Please tell me your thoughts on the album in comments!

A Noobs Rating: 7.75/10

And I wish he could love himself like the genuine affection he always gave us and music.
Then I realize he must have been strong for too long. Its okay for me now to see him cry. His happiness is mine. So is his sorrow. He has us and BTS by his side. And I know he will become stronger by doing exactly the things he cant do.

Welcome to the fourth part of my A Noob Listens... series. If you havent checked out my previous reactions to 2 Cool 4 Skool, O!RUL8,2?, and Skool Luv Affair, I would recommend checking those out as well. Today its Dark &amp; Wild and I am very very excited :3 I was told I would really really like this one and so I am probably going in with pretty high expectations but I will try to keep it as objective as possible. Thank you to everyone for keeping up with my journey here!

Intro- What Am I To You: Wow extremely epic orchestral intro here. Im so excited for this album. RM does a great job here. I just absolutely love the production here already I have a feeling those people were probably right.

Danger: Oh shit this sounds epic. Everyone sounds fucking great here oh my god Im falling into the Stannie rabbit hole where I cant say anything negative at all. But I dont know what Id even say. I dont know how Ive never heard this song before its fucking amazing, the chorus is fucking great and the beat grooves just right under their voices. Also I can now swear in Korean lol.

War Of Hormone: Wow this song is too relatable. Also I love Jungkooks line Im 18 I know what I need to know Jungkook doesnt strike me as a bad boy at all but Ill give it to him he probably didnt have rainbow hair at this point and I think that softened him in my eyes. Anyway this song is great and I fucking love this band now okay.

Hip Hop Phile: Wow RMs lyrics here are fucking great. I love all of the references to rappers here. I hope that isnt lost on the very large majority of teenage girls that are fans of BTS. Also we Stan a Kendrick Stan here. 

Let Me Know: Yes V coming in for this Chorus gives me life thank you. God Ive really been missing out here these guys are fucking great. The production on this album is so minimal and I think that really works in its favor. Their voices get to be center stage as they should be.

Rain: Wow this beat is fantastic. The piano bar beat is so interesting Im not entirely sure what I could compare this too. Its very unique.

BTS Cypher Pt. 3- Killer: Oh shit this beat is fucking cool. This might be my favorite Cypher Ive heard from them so far. Honestly this is the first braggy song that feels justified in terms of context overall. Supreme Boi has a cool feature here. Honestly all three of them are out here spitting straight fire.

Interlude- What Are You Doing: OOF this is such a funky instrumental here wow. I need to learn how to play this bass line ASAP

Would You Turn Off Your Cellphone?: Oh my god this has 90s hip hop vibes all over the place in a fucking great way. This is pretty ironic considering how large of a presence they have on social media now. Guess people havent looked at the lyrics to this song. This has flower boy vibes and I fucking adore it

Blanket Kick: Oof this song is relatable... I love it so much. Definitely going on my Girlfriends playlist! Great little love song about being shy.

24/7= Heaven: Wow this feels very early 2000s but I dig it. The chorus is super beautiful and the vocals are incredibly impressive here.

Look Here: Wow this acoustic guitar beat is funky as hell. God this album is so strong I cant find anything wrong with it lol.

2nd Grade: Lol this is a cool song about staying true to yourself with a cool second grader analogy. The bridge here sounds like a Migos song and I mean that in the best way.

Outro- Does That Make Sense?: What a great note to leave this album on! Its so emotional and dramatic. Theres a Tyler the creator-esque part in here with the modulated vocal that I think is pretty cool.

Overall Thoughts/ Review:
Wow you guys were right this is definitely my favorite album so far! What a great and cohesive release. It also finally sounds like the BTS that Ive heard. I think its fucking great and If youve never listened to this album all the way through you need to! I honestly cannot find anything wrong with it which is why it earns my first perfect score :3

A Noob Rates: 10/10

Leader RM, of boygroup BTS, is set to release his solo mixtape, the first in 3 years.

BTSs agency BigHit Entertainment revealed the tracklist for RMs new mixtape, mono on their official Twitter account at midnight, on 10/21.

Going by the revealed tracklist, this mixtape includes seoul, moonchild, badbye, amiss, pass by and more, for a total of 7 tracks.

Of the songs, the 2nd track seoul, is garnering interest for being produced by British duo HONNE. During a recent interview, HONNE, an electronic soul duo comprised of Andy Clutterbuck (vocal, producer) and James Hatcher (producer), picked RM, when asked if there were any K-pop musicians they liked. Last July, during their interview with Newsen, when asked if there were any K-pop musicians they would like to work with, HONNE answered Our minds havent changed, we like RM of BTS. Finally, there is much interest to see what kind of synergy this collaboration between the two teams will bring.

In addition, the sixth track pass by, completed with the band, Nell, is garnering anticipation.

RM also personally teased the mixtape. At the same time as the official agency announcement, he tweeted from the official BTS account, RMs playlist mono. 10/23 with the tracklist.

As mixtapes contain music created for non-commercial purposes, they are released for free.

Previously, RM released his first solo mixtape RM in 2015, to great reception of both critics and hip hop listeners, alike. Including the title track, Do You, follow-up title Awakening, and Rush, which features rapper Krizz Kaliko, signed to Strange Music (his labelmate is famous American rapper Tech N9ne), this mixtape is comprised of 11 tracks and was chosen by famed American media outlet, SPIN, as #48 out of 2015s 50 best hip hop albums. Being the first K-pop musician to make it on the list was also a big topic of conversation.

This post may be pointless if Big Hit only releases Mono on SoundCloud, but since Hope World was made available on streaming and digital download platforms it's safe to assume that Mono will follow suit. Also it's Joon's ""playlist"" and not a mixtape so there should be minimal to no sampling, allowing him to release it on Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Google Play Music, Tidal, etc.

---

#The Issue

Mono only has 7 tracks on the playlist. 

Billboard uses **[Album Equivalent Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-equivalent_unit)**, where 1 album sale = 10 digital song downloads = 1250 paid or premium streams = 3750 ad-supported streams. If you've been active in the fandom for any BTS comeback you know that we encourage buying tracks individually to use Track Equivalent Albums (TEA) to contribute to Billboard 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously. If you aren't aware of this, read the 1-to-1 TEA section in a old guide I wrote up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8c9iyr/a_comprehensive_guide_to_helping_bts_chart_on/)!

This means that buying Mono's tracks individually will only contribute 0.7 units to Billboard 200 and 1 unit of the possible MV ""title track"" to Hot 100. Comparatively, armys that purchased all 25 songs on Love Yourself: Answer (plus IDOL ft. Nicki Minaj) on a digital download platform contributed 2.6 units to Billboard 200 and 2 units to Hot 100. In this case, few will bother to buy an extra 3 songs on another account or platform to contribute 1 full unit to Billboard 200 and 2 units to the Hot 100.

#Focusing on Billboard 200

In my opinion (and the opinion of many armys on Twitter), Billboard 200 should be our main focus as a fandom. With our buying power it might be possible to get Mono to chart Top 10 on Billboard 200 if we prioritize it over Hot 100. Since the album and a possible MV will be released on 10/23 in Korea we will only get half of a tracking week for Billboard charting. A radio station has that Big Hit hasn't promoted or sent any title track to them for radio play (also let's be real, they totally ignored IDOL). And with our weakness at streaming the title track alone, buying is only real factor that will help with Hot 100 charting.

#Efficient Approaches to Charting

1. **Complete the album** (buy the entire album) instead of buying tracks individually to contribute 1 full unit to Billboard 200. If an MV is released, buy the ""title track"" on another account or platform to contribute 1 unit to Hot 100, and also stream it on paid and/or free streaming platforms.

2. **Buy all 7 songs individually and then purchase three additional songs** (title track from the possible MV plus 2 additional favorites) on another account or platform to contribute 1 unit to Billboard 200 and 2 units of the ""title track"" to Hot 100.

3. For the super dedicated armys, go all out to support Joon's 2nd solo release and **buy all of the tracks individually on two accounts or platforms** to contribute 1.4 units to Billboard 200 and 2 units of the ""title track"" to Hot 100.

Some things have come up at home and here in SK (primarily home) and I need to get rid of my on hand stuff quick and stop taking requests. I'm too sad and tired to get into the logistics of it, but it's financial issues, paired with drama and stuff.

But if I just look at them as if they weren't my Ult-B group, here's what I would have thought: 

&amp;#x200B;

**NJ:** *Lead Rapper, Main Dancer*

I definitely saw his long limbs and thought, ""Wow, what a graceful man."" Boy, was I wrong... But what a whole cutie! And what duality! He's got a fierceness to him that just immediately made me think: RAPPER! Like mu guy always has his head held high in most photos and he looked like the embodiment of confidence and swag.

&amp;#x200B;

**SJ:** *Lead Vocals*

He looked to me like he had a sweet sweet voice that he could wield to end me, you feel? He, to me, looked like he was picked off the street after he intoxicated someone with his voice, but he's shy about it. In a lot of the American press stuff that I saw, Jin looked quiet and introspective, as if he was hiding his powerful voice behind his shy smile. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YK:** *Lead Rapper,* *Mathyung*

Okay, admittedly, Yoongi is so squishy looking. But my friend had seen them live during the *Wings* tour and said he was quiet and almost intimidating. He also looked a bit awkward in some photos and I saw that as a sign of an older dude trying to stay composed as long as possible. So, I thought that he must have been the eldest and that he was a powerful rapper.

&amp;#x200B;

**HS:** *Main Rapper, Sub Vocals, Leader* 

In most of the photos I saw, Hoseok always ended up on one of the outermost corner of group shots. But he didn't shrink, he smiled wide and looked the viewer straight in the face, So, I thought he was the leader and he has a musical way of speaking that I thought would be perfect for both singing and rapping. 

&amp;#x200B;

**JM:** *Lead Vocals, Lead Dancer, Center*

Okay. Listen. Jimin is so striking, I was watching ""Run"" for the first time and I was so confused, but Jimin was so striking. I thought, ""Welp, I'd put that boy as the star of all my videos!"" And his singing voice, especially when he goes ham on the high notes? Also, he's so genteel and small and one of my oldest friends is the same way and she's a dancer, so I extrapolated from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TH:** *Main Vocals, Maknae* 

Okay, I definitely, like most people, didn't expect such a deep ass voice to resonate from this man's vocal chords. But, I did think he would have a beautiful voice that could woo me. Also, this boy looks like the softest little bun. I thought he would be the baby of the group. And, even though he actually sort of is sometimes, he looks like he could be held on to for safety forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

**JK:** *Main Vocal, Visual* 

Bro, this man is so flawless looking to me. Like, he's got symmetry and a snatched waist. I thought he was the eye candy of the group. He' got this soft ass smile and I thought that he was in charge of the looks department. Also, when I first started stanning, I hear a lot of JK-ult people and I really thought they were most definitely there for a reason.

\*sorry in advance for bad grammer/ lots of points etc. This was sort of an emotional thought dump I needed to get out 

  
  (August 2018) - So I had never even really heard of K-pop / J-pop etc but my friend kept saving memes of BTS on pinterest. Finally, I saw the meme that was like I just wanted to know their names and know I'm deep in the fandom.  I thought yeah, sure. I want to know their names too since these memes make no sense.   
  The very first video I found was the Fake Love Comeback Stage version and ho boy was that intense. \\r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LB4JWRnyrM   
    
  Honestly, when I think k-pop I picture something super pink / kawaii and in-your-face cute. This was dark / edgy and I got kind of an emo / underground vibe to it. I was intrigued (not that I'm particularly into emo music. I like everything, but this was super unexpected). The second I saw V I was in love. When he does that thing where he looks up slowly into the camera and starts singing? Yeah. His face was pretty okay (I had never been attracted to asian's, but BTS solved that quick haha), but it was his deep AF vocals that instantly hooked me.   

  
  The weird thing is he looks so insanely different in this video to me than in anything else they have done (including the music video). I think its the dark mullet? I dunno, but everytime I see him in this MV I want to melt. I also get the feeling he reminds me of someone I know?? (never been able to place it... maybe its just the vibes V gives out.. anyone else?) 

  
  The next thing that hooked me was when he does that little point with his hand to the camera and when he uses his back / hand to lift Jungkook. His hands were so soft and gentle and that was the moment I knew this would become bad haha. Then the little scrunched faces and sexy expressions he uses throughout the dance literally had me dying.   
  The first few (or 30) runthroughs I never took my eyes off V so it took a little while to notice the rest. 

  
  First impressions of everyone else: 

Jungkook  I thought he was such a little f\*\*\*boy haha! The red sequined jacket thing really threw me, and I thought he was such an attention seeker. I also thought he was older than Tae. When he did the iconic shirtlift it solidified my (totally wrong lol) idea that he was just a player and probably a jerk and stripped on stage often (I WISH). He seemed like someone who knew he was pretty and used it often (Now he's my bias wrecker \* **shrugs \*)**

   
  Rap Monster: RM was the next one that really made an impression. I didnt realize Kpop meant any genre, so the rap in the middle of singing felt really jarring at first. I didn't find him that attactive initially (he became my bias wrecker for a bit though haha) and that thing he does where he drags his hand across his face and smiles made me think he was kind of arrogant and full of himself(Why you sad? I dont know. I dont know. Smile, say 'I love you'. Look at me, even I gave up on myself  sorry I know its english, only way I could find it) 

  
  Jimin: Next impression was Jimin. He also looks really different to me from anything else they've done. I thought he might have been Japanese at first from the hair with the subtle red highlights. I was getting kind of a japanese-horror-movie-star feel from him (? dont know how else to describe it) and found his solo pretty sexy. Weirdly, this is the only thing I really bias him in (sorry Jimin-fans) 

  
  Jin: Next up was Jin. Again, his outfit threw me and I thought he was trying to be a western cowboy HAHA ( I live in cowboy country in Canada so this made me very very confused until I watched another video of them). I didnt really notice him until his solo, but saw he was tall with a good build and I really liked his voice. His confident stride during his solo was hot as hell though. Was still more curious about his outfit than him at this point and in my head kept calling him the cowboy 

  
  \*Suga and J-hope  sorry stanners but they didnt leave an impression on me for a very long time. I didn't even notice Hobi was there and Suga just wasn't doing it for me initially (again with the raphowever Mic Drop is now a top fav of mine soooo \* shrug \*)   
    
    
  \*\*\*ANYWAY\*\*\* I got curious and wasnt sure if comeback stage meant LIVE and I wanted to know for sure that the insanely sexy voice of Tae was his and not just all of them sort of singing on top of each other. SO next up was the DNA comeback stage / DNA MV where I was insanely confused by all the different haircolors and couldn't recognize anybody haha. Quickly learned they were NOT some emo band and instantly fell headfirst into this insanity of MV / Vlive's / Run eps / youtube compilations /  multiple albums etc, etc. And there is no turning back.  

&amp;#x200B;

So my wallet has lost yet another battle, and I'm really wanting to buy some of the BT21 x VT products, but I don't know where to find them.

The only site I've found them on so far is one called [Harumio](https://www.harum.io/), but I'm a bit wary of it due to lack of reviews.

Please share your favorite translators from any social media, including Reddit, and lets show them some love. Also, if you happen to have translated anything (and I mean anything) for this sub or for elsewhere please make yourself known and share your story.

Welcome to the fifth part of my A Noob Listens.. series. Today Im taking on Namjoons mixtape RM. I know literally nothing about this album so Im excited to get right into it!

Voices: Wow the piano instrumental here is so beautiful. I know I keep comparing tracks to Tyler, The Creator, but I really see it here. Wow uh I had no idea RM could sing (I hope thats him or that would be embarrassing)

Do You: Ive heard this song before? I dont even remember how but I definitely have. Great song here. reminds me a ton of Tamale by Tyler, The Creator (and I fucking love that song) but like if the lyrics were way less raunchy lmao.

Awakening: Wow this song is so epic. The instrumental is great here too. I love how it builds and builds and RM gets more and more into it until hes basically yelling. Love the Rimbaud reference. Damn if you guys love this album and youve never heard Flower Boy by Tyler, The Creator Id highly recommend it to you!

Monster: Oh wow a J. Cole sample. Dope. This song is great I dont have anything constructive to say about it other then its really really good.

Throw Away: Oh wow this is my favorite so far. I love the heavy ass instrumental. RM is so fucking talented like I cant stress that enough. The chorus is definitely going to be stuck in my head for a while now.

Joke: Not a huge fan of the use of the R word here but I kinda can understand why he used it. This song might be a little too braggy for me... I dont know hes clearly very talented but I dont support the slut shaming and stuff going on here (THIS IS JUST MY OPINION IM NOT TRYING TO START A FIRESTORM)

God Rap: This song opening is kind of bizarre considering RM is an open atheist. Makes sense later though. Favorite line is There is no such thing as religion cause my god is myself

Rush: I love the funky vibes here. Krizz Kaliko has a great feature and I think he really steals the show here.

Life: Wow the lyricism in this song is so beautiful. RMs flow here is so nice and his almost whispered lines really help this song to feel like a confessional of sorts.

Adrift: Wow this Drake sample is really cool. The chorus has such a beautiful lyric here: Where is my meaning where is my heart in this vast universe Im endlessly adrift So beautiful.

I Believe: Welcome back boys. God I really liked this album but the whole time I was sitting here waiting for the other members to start singing and we finally get it on the last song of the album. Im glad to have them back since I was kind of missing listening to them by the end.

Overall Thoughts/ Review:
I really enjoyed this album. The samples are great and I think the arrangements and production here are both extremely strong. My biggest complaint is that to me it almost feels like the other six members are missing. I hope thats valid.

A Noobs Rating: 8/10

its just that so many of their songs are soooo damn catchy, i mean dope? fire? best of me (i dont love it but its the kind of thing western people would like). its not like non-english songs havent become hits before. 

and goodness dont even get me started on blood sweat and tears. imo if that was the song they performed at the 2018 bbmas it would have absolutely blown up. so freaking catchy.

# MONO RELEASE

* First of all: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* The release date is **10/23**.
* The survivor games **will not be posted for at least the week** of the Mono release.
* I have added questions to this week's poll on **1) when we should resume** the survivor series, and **2) if we should do Mono or Agust D next** (after we finish the final round of RM).
* I will leave **Round 9 open** until the final round is posted.

# GAME RULES

* As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.
* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.
* Choose wisely! **Your vote is final** and cannot be changed.
* I will post a new poll every **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Sunday**. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted. I try to post around **8 AM - 10 AM PST**. Sometimes it may take longer if I need to download and analyze the data when the vote is close or seems odd, or if my personal life intrudes.
* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""** and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

# Round 9

Sustainable K-Pop presented by BTS

Jegy Ra, Head of the Culture Desk, Hankook Ilbo

&amp;#x200B;

A member of an idol group recently took a trip to Italy. It was with his parents. They rented a car and visited the tourist attractions with a tour guide. Before the tour, the parents asked the guide for understanding. ""Please understand that it is possible that we will have people flocking to us since our son is popular."" The tour guide did not know much about idol groups, so thought, 'Even if there are many Korean tourists, how bad could it be...' But it was different from what he had expected. Whenever the family visited major tourist destinations, foreign fans recognized the idol group member and rushed to him. The guide suddenly had to serve a role as his bodyguard as well. After finishing the job, the guide shared with his friends his experience, and only then he realized he had spent a day with a really famous star. The customer was a member of BTS. This is a story shared by a tour guide.

&amp;#x200B;

BTS is hugely popular. There has been a series of events that taught us how high their status is since last year. BTS, for the first time as a Korean act, topped the Billboard 200, an album chart of Billboard, an American magazine specializing in music. BTS received the Favorite Social Artist from American Music Awards, addressed the UN for the youth of the world, and sang and danced in front of 40,000 audiences at CitiField, New York, which is a symbol of the American pop market. Some even speculate that BTS might be on the stage of the GRAMMY Awards that is considered as a tall and solid wall for singers from non-English speaking countries. BTS is the first K-pop singer who, for the first time, entered the western music marketAmerican music market, to be specific. The established, older generation might cast a doubt, asking how much BTS is achieving, like the tour guided mentioned earlier. But BTS is already a worldwide phenomenon. It is highly likely that the definition of K-Pop will be different before and after BTS.

The success of BTS is exceptional. Though it is said that K-pop is popular worldwide, it has so far considered as a mainstream of the non-mainstream. The way it was understood by most people was that it is loved in Asian and Latin American markets and supported by some music fans in the US and Europe. There are many foreigners who are not attracted by but rather show their disgust at the robot-like synchronized choreography, saying that it is the evidence of hardcore training.

&amp;#x200B;

The success of BTS is also paradoxical. The process of BTS climbing up to its current position with struggles has the dark side of K-Pop industry in the background. BigHit Entertainment, BTS agency, was a small company, and the entrance barrier was high. The members of BTS, debuted in 13, did not hesitate to make themselves a laughingstock as they appeared on various entertainment programs on cable channels during the early days of their activities, which is something we did not see from idol groups from the big three: SM, JYP, and YG. Watching foreign fans accounts on YouTube, there are many fans mentioning the underprivileged days of BTS. The members do not identify themselves as stars. They are bright and always positive. Many fans find a hope from the success story of BTS that overcame hardships.

&amp;#x200B;

The style of BigHit in managing BTS is also atypical. Unlike some other agencies that monitor and control not only the romantic relationships of the members but also their posting one line of text on social media, BigHit gives the members of BTS autonomy. We do not see any robot-like quality from BTS members, who express their own thoughts in a sincere and coherent manner. In short, BTS is another kind of K-Pop.

&amp;#x200B;

K-Pop idols have a short life. They have many fans at home and abroad, but they cannot live long. It is rare to see idol groups overcome the 7th year jinx where a group disbands after the initial contract expires after 7 years. Some famous foreign pop singers and groups have been around for decades, but the same story does not apply to K-Pop singers. It has become a norm for singers to switch their career paths, becoming actors/actresses. There is a high chance that BTS will be active for an exceptionally long period of time and remain as a beloved K-Pop idol without necessarily having to work as actors. Unintentionally, BTS is presenting a sustainable model for the future of K-pop.

As I'm sure some of you are aware, a couple of days ago, a Youtuber by the name of Dee Kosh posted [this] (https://twitter.com/TheDeeKosh/status/1052933791797280768) on Twitter. It blew up and he ended up getting a lot of attention from the fandom. Many of the tweets he directly quoted are deleted now, but there were a lot of memes as well a few insults and some hate directed towards him to the point where he eventually posted a video crying about all of the hate he was receiving, and then [this tweet] (https://twitter.com/TheDeeKosh/status/1053236706235699200), claiming that his Youtube channel was flagged and taken down by ARMYs. The entire situation got pretty big on Twitter and today, Dee Kosh posted [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TIkuAndRuY), calling the entire situation a ""social experiment"" and explaining that the entire thing was planned out beforehand and he wanted to see how ARMY would react when he posted something negative about BTS on Twitter and it eventually escalated into what it is now. (He makes some interesting points in the video, a bit long but definitely recommend watching to get a more in-depth look at the whole situation.)

After watching the video, there are undoubtedly some points he makes that are questionable at best and a valid argument to be made that he's just doing this for attention and views, but the social media presence that this fandom has is quite frankly insane, and (Uncle Ben voice) with great power comes great responsibilities. When we send love, it's amazing and we can do incredible things, but there is a larger conversation to be had about how extreme and overwhelming ARMY can be in these Dee Kosh-type situations, especially on Twitter. 

Being an avid lurker on this sub as well as on stan Twitter for years, I really really really wanted to hear some of your opinions on this whole situation, so: What are your thoughts in general about this entire situation, do you think mob mentality exists in the fandom, and if yes, how so?",27,1,False,self,,,,,

Welcome to the sixth part of my A Noob Listens.. series. Today Ill be taking on The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Young Forever I decided this would be the easiest way to review this era, rather than doing parts 1 and 2 and then having to do one for the additional songs. This one was quite the challenge to finish but without further ado, here it is.

Intro- The Most Beautiful moment In Life: Holy shit what a good start. The lyrical content of this song is amazing. The lyrics are so deep and introspective and you can really tell RM is reflection on the past three years of his life in this group. Great start.

I NEED U: Wow these lyrics have really really matured here, this song is insanely catchy, I can tell why this album won album of the year for sure already.

Hold Me Tight: Wow this song has a really great instrumental. V has the perfect voice for chorus here, his voice just has this raw emotion that I really love.

Autumn Leaves: This song is beautiful lyrically. The chorus is also stellar here. The fallen leaves analogy is so poetic and beautiful. God this album is really gonna fuck me up I can already tell.

Butterfly: This song is fucking beautiful. I dont even know what to say. This song is arranged so beautifully.

Run: Im glad theres an upbeat song here next because this was getting a little too real for me. This song is so catchy it was stuck in my head. The lyrics were way deeper then I was expecting but Im glad they are. The bridge sung by V, Jungkook, and Jin is absolutely beautiful.

Ma City: This song is so delightfully Korean. I absolutely love Sugas verse here. Its such a Suga-like verse to completely go the opposite route of the other rappers and make this kind of almost depressing verse about Daegu

Silver Spoon: God I love this beat. The hook is so infectious. I have no idea who is calling them Crow Tit though lol.

DOPE: This is probably the first BTS song I remember being shown by my friend. I dont know how I didnt become immediately obsessed with them. This song kicks ass. Enough said.

Fire: Heard this song before but damn what a solid bop. This song gets stuck in my head a lot. I just love the chorus.

Save Me: God I love this song so much. The production is so dreamy and beautiful. The chorus is so catchy and it honestly just makes me want to get up and dance.

Epilogue- Young Forever: Oh my god this song is beautiful and wonderful I fucking adore it. I think I could listen to the chorus to this song forever (get it lmao)

Converse High: I love converse as much as the next guy but this is some serious dedication. Cons should have given them a brand deal. Although I do think I heard they did a collab with them but I think it was after this. Correct me if Im wrong. The song might me a little gimmicky but its still funky so I approve.

Moving On: Wow this song is really interesting. I loved getting this baby glance into their actual lives as people and not as these larger then life characters. V rocks this chorus.

Whalien 52: Oh boy a lot of people told me this song would make me feel things and I can totally see why. The lyrics are so dark and beautiful here. The chorus is very powerful. J-hope had an extremely surprising verse. Ive always thought of him as like the happy sunny one but to see even he has these struggles is pretty inspiring.

House Of Cards: Wow emotional and powerful. The music video for this song is really cool. I can really hear all of the emotions theyre feeling which I appreciate.

Love Is Not Over: This song is super great.. period. The lyrics are great.

Boyz With Fun: Wow this feels like Skool Luv Affair BTS coming back in here, Im a huge fan for sure. It mixes their older funky rap style with their more current beautiful choruses into one cohesive song.

Intro- Never Mind: Suga really out here giving this great performance. I didnt listen to them in traditional order since I wanted to cover the entire era in one post, but I can tell this would be the perfect intro to Part 2.

Overall Thoughts/ Review: Really really great and solid all the way through. Songs like Young Forever, Whalien 52, Butterfly, and I NEED YOU were some of my favorites here. Really powerful shit. You can definitely tell theyve really grown into extremely talented songwriters. My only complaint is the back half lacks some upbeat songs to keep me in a pleasant mood, but I cant really fault it too much for that.

A Noob Rates: 9.5/10

Stay tuned for Yoongis Agustd tomorrow! Thank you to everyone for the overwhelming support and excellent feedback.",25,1,False,self,,,,,

Tata Standing Doll  - $ 40  
Exhibition Photobook  - $ 40  
Koya Lying Down Doll  -  $ 30  
Chimmy Paris Baguette Mug  - $ 15     
Mang Paris Baguette Mug  - $15   
Chimmy, Shooky and Cooky Halloween Magnets  - $ 25  
Tata Paris Baguette Tumbler - $ 25  
RJ Metal Liquid Container - $ 30    
Chimmy Metal Liquid Container - $ 30   
Character Face Sticky Notes (From the Monopoly Collaboration) (all 7) - Gift  
  
This is not counting shipping which Im assuming will be around $60. The metal containers are kind of heavy.  
The total is $310 which I know is hefty, but if you were in the market for these items they should be much cheaper than what you would pay for.  
  
I hate this and know it will be downvoted to oblivion (rightfully so, sob stories suck), but if anyone is interested and wants to buy from me, Id really appreciate it and be eternally indebted. I can get your stuff out today and hopefully put an end to this nightmare for me.  
  
Thank you all. Im sorry again. This is really embarrassing.",18,1,False,self,,,,,

Our bond not only with eachother but also with BTS are one of the main reasons they are as big as they are right now. Not only we do constantly stream or do charity work in BTS' name as a birthday gift for a member, we support them wherever we can even if it just means buying an album that they give us for free.
I am multifandom but I dont know any other fandom or boyband that has received as much hate as ARMYS and BTS. We are constantly being called toxic but people that trend hate hashtags or start a petition to the blue house to disband BTS always get away with it somehow.
Its always ""BTS didnt pave the way, the generation before them did!!!!!""
But when NCT127 or Monsta X are making it big in America right now and even mention BTS by name, they never say that. No, those bands paved their own way, no one helped them! (I mean its true they are amazing!) But no one ever wants to give BTS the credit they deserve.

The hate our fandom and BTS received, even before they debuted, made us form a close Unity and this is why they are so sucessful. Everytime I see a new group mention BTS the comments from ARMY are as wholesome as can be, because we know how it feels to receive unnecessary hate.

We barely have any solo stans and we support each member fully. There is no BTS with one member missing. RM's mono is outcharting BTS as a whole and we still go around show the entire rapline some love by charting Hope World and Agust D again. 
I love this fandom so much and when I went to see BTS live in concert I realized how big of a family we actually are. Its like the entire arena knew eachother for years.
As much as I love BigBang, Monsta X, Shinee, Seventeen etc. - BTS as a group and our fandom can not be compared to anyone or anything else. Thank you for bringing me so much joy and making me feel like im part of something.

I love you ARMY.

Welcome to the seventh part of my A Noob Listens... series. Today Im listening to Min Yoongis Agust D I know literally nothing about this album but Im excited to jump right into it.

Intro- Dt sugA: very cool intro. This instrumental is super rad. Gets me very excited for what Im about to hear as Ive been a big fan of everything Ive heard of Sugas so far.

Agust D: Suga has major major skills. I do hope he understands the STD thing or that might be a little bit embarrassing for him lol. VERSE 3 AND 4 OH MY GOD. Catchy hook.

Give It To Me: I love the heavy bass here. This album feels a lot more my style then RMs mixtape. (Doesnt mean I didnt like his though because I did) This song is really just a bop and a half if Ive ever heard one.

Skit: Back at it with the skits I see. This one isnt really funny though. Its more just like... uplifting I guess? Nice to see him thank his brother for his support.

724148: A bassline is really the #1 way into my heart. This has like a Rage Against The Machine vibe and I really really dig that. The drums here have so much life in them it really adds to the track. Very cool to hear about Sugas rise to the top and his struggles.

140503 At Dawn: Wow this song is pretty cool. The minimal production really lets Sugas flow take center stage in a way I havent previously seen. The lyrics are very relatable too. For a short track its pretty good.

The Last: Wow I love this song so much. His openness about mental illness is really nice to see especially from my limited understanding of Korean society as a pretty repressive place. Poor Suga though like you can tell hes had a ton of this shit on his mind for a very long time. Anyway this song is fucking great.

Tony Montana: I dont think I know who Tony Montana is but honestly this song sounds like every hit song I heard last year but it did come out in 2016 so I guess Suga was a little ahead of the curve here. Im not the biggest fan of the Migos production here but the song is still very cool.

Interlude- Dream Reality: Cool little funky instrumental here. Not entirely sure why the interlude is right before the last song though lol.

So Far Away: Oh wow this songs lyrics are fucking great. God this album has been really fucking awesome and this is a great finale. Suran has a great feature here.

Overall Thoughts/ Review:
Ive really enjoyed this album. Im really glad you guys convinced me to give their mixtapes a listen while I was working on this series. Suga is an excellent songwriter and producer too. Slow rabbit does a great job coproducing as usual. Overall, I think this is a great and extremely cohesive album. I just wish there were more then 7 actual songs.

A Noob Rates: 9.5/10

Welcome to the eighth part of my A Noob Listens... series. Today Im listening to You Never Walk Alone For the first time. Ill be covering the Wings era today and Im pretty excited about it! Lets get into it!

Intro- Boy Meets Evil: Oh god Im already excited about this. Ive heard that this album is like peak emo BTS and Im very here for it.

Blood Sweat &amp; Tears: This is the song that prompted this deep dive in the first place. This song also was my favorite BTS song when I started this journey (Oh my things have changed) I still love this track though.

Begin: Oh wow I really like this song. Its definitely on the ballad side of things during the verses but then the chorus comes in and its just really really beautiful here.

Lie: I love the instrumentation to this song so much. Jimin (Im pretty sure thats who this is) really nails this song. God the chorus is so fucking beautiful I can really picture this being a great breakup song. The little intricacies of the instrumentation really adds to the cohesiveness of this song. I didnt know how I was going to feel about their solo songs here but this one is fucking great.

Stigma: My bias finally gets his solo song and Im here for it. I love the multilayered vocals here. V really shows his vocal range here which I think we can all agree is pretty impressive. I love the beat here that keeps it from falling into sappy ballad territory.

First Love: Wow I really wasnt expecting a spoken word song on this album but I really liked it. The instrumentation was very nice.

Reflection: Woah my native language for a second there that was cool. Id kill for an all English album one of these days. RM would probably have to write everyones lyrics though so Im not sure if I can see that ever happening. Anyway, this song gets me feeling all kinds of emotional and these lyrics are A1 relatable.

MAMA: 2006 was a really hard time in my life too. Thats when my parents started fighting pretty badly (they eventually got divorced) but like I really love this song and its message. Shout out to my mom for taking care of me single handedly for all those years.

Awake: Oh god this song is sad as fuck. I love the strings here though. And the lyrics are really beautiful.

Lost: I love Jimin vocals here. I really relate tot here lyrics especially right now in my life. The chorus is really catchy and relatable. The EDM flavored beat sounds great here coupled with the veracity of the lyrics.

BTS Cypher 4: God I really love the instrumental here. I love throwing this song on to get me hyped. I have it on my work out playlist and it always gets me hyped up. The use of bae here is pretty cringe considering it was 2016 but I can give it a break since it was probably recorded in 2015 when that was still relevant. Everyone sounds excellent here and I think if they released this song in America right now it would be another top 10 hit for them.

Am I Wrong: God I love the instrumental here so much. Its such a hype beat. Keb Mo has this really nice voice that works super well here. The call and response vocals are pretty nice here too.

21st Century Girl: Solid song with a great message. Love the beat here, especially the quick drums of the first verses.

2! 3!: this song is really beautiful. I love their lyrics here. The beat is super strong too. I love how sometimes the drums drop out from the song to emphasize the building of the verses into the chorus.

Spring Day: Wow this song is really beautiful and the melody is really catchy and beautiful. I really cant say enough good things about this song honestly.

Not Today: I love this song. Its one of my favorite workout songs right now. I would love to learn the dance for this song because its seriously bad ass.

Wings: Wow this song is a serious anthem. I can just picture absolutely losing it to this song at a concert. I dont know if they ever had this in their live set but they should have.

Supplementary Story- You Never Walk Alone: Oh wow this song is fucking rad. I love the message. The beat just builds and builds and builds through the verses and the payoff is excellent. The vocal line does a great job here. Sugas opening verse has such poignant lyrics like holy shit what an insightful guy.

Overall Thoughts/ Review:
Wow. I had a feeling I would really love this album but not even I thought Id dig it this much. It really reaches that perfect balance between hard hitting rap songs and beautiful ballads but it keeps it from ever feeling too mopey. I really throughly enjoyed this album just as much as I loved Dark &amp; Wild which is why its getting my second perfect score!

A Noob Rates: 10/10

Stay tuned for Hope World tomorrow! I honestly have no idea if I will be able to get the Love Yourself era done in time for Friday but I will try my best! Thank you all for the fantastic responses to this series, Im actually pretty sad to see it start coming to a close but that will mean Ill be an official ARMY member.

The only song he knew was Blood Sweat &amp; Tears because he liked the music video but throughout the entire show he kept turning to me and asking what song is this and when we got home he downloaded a bunch of BTS songs on this phone.

Just wondering if anyone has seen Sam Johnson and his singing critique videos before. I really like his stuff as I think he's quite knowledgeable and he is very supportive and positive about everyone's voice. Even when he reviews performances others say are 'bad' (e.g. X-Factor auditions) he is more interested in how the individual can make improvements rather than being mean about their voice. He also has a general K-Pop video looking at hitting high notes. I really enjoyed hearing what he had to say about BTS.

Welcome to the ninth part of my A Noob Listens.. series. Im excited for today as Im going to be listening to to J-Hopes mixtape Hope World for the first time. Yes I already know it came out in between the love yourself albums but since Ill be doing the LY series as one post, I decided to listen to this one first since it did indeed come out before Answer. Anyway, lets get right to it!

Hope World: Oof this is like the happiest rap I think Ive ever heard. He just radiates this positive vibe that I absolutely love. The chorus is super super catchy. Nothing to complain about at all so fr, other then I prefer my rap on the edgy side but this is a nice change of pace.

P.O.P: This island instrumental reminds me of being in the Caribbean. J-Hope is seriously the nicest dude I think Ive ever encountered. He just wants to make people happy and I think thats super rad.

Daydream: This song is super super catchy and groovy. J-Hope is seriously just like the more carefree dude its really inspiring.

Base Line: This is much more my style. I love the scratching its such a fun throwback to old school rap which I am a huge fan of. Too short though.

HANGSANG: this beat is more my style, but I honestly find J-Hopes voice here to be pretty grating. Especially during the hangsang parts.

Airplane: This song has great lyrics and a great beat. Might be my favorite track on the album considering base line is too short.

Blue Side: I love this instrumentation, yet another track I wish was longer. I also love the bass on this song (Im extremely biased bass player okay)

Overall Thoughts/ Review: Not always quite my style, but definitely plenty enjoyable. Pretty different stylistically to BTS for sure but it definitely still feels like classic J-Hope. I guess Im just not the biggest fan of this style. Please keep in mind this is only my personal opinion and Im in no way at all a professional music reviewer. Please take my opinions with a grain of salt.

A Noob Rates: 7/10

Thank you guys so much for reading my review/ reaction. Tomorrow is the big daddy Love Yourself: Answer and there are so many songs I literally have no idea how Im going to do this but Im gonna try my best to get it out! This is probably also your last chance to request any songs Ive missed during my deep dive here. So if I missed anything integral to their discography, please let me know!

 Shipping is INCLUDED in the price.  
 I'm shipping worldwide from Korea.  
 The only complete set I have is Season 2. I am willing to discount the whole set at $260 if you decide you want all of the boys ($41 off).    
 Unfortunately I am not selling singles at this moment.  
 Photos are your standard 4x6 size. The back has Fujifilm markings, along with the file name of the photo. Yoongi's Season 2 does NOT have the file name. I have confirmed this with other folks; it seems like no photo of his from that set has the file name.

Probably every possible reaction under the sun.

I've also seen reactions to those reactions (to those reactions to those reactions ....). And I've got to say, I'm really disappointed in how some people are trying to smother others' opinions, say other people aren't ""real fans"" because they aren't hype about the new song, say it's unnecessary negativity etc. etc. etc.

I get that people are excited about BTS's advancement and want them to keep climbing and get more recognition and do even bigger things. I think we all want that. Some fans not being head over heels for every single thing they ever do isn't going to ruin that. I think we can all agree that if you're posting on this sub, you must like the boys. So it's really unfair and really nasty to accuse people of not being real fans or not being good enough fans because they have a negative opinion or a criticism of something. And it's not healthy to try and suppress other innocent opinions. It's not fair to make snide remarks about ""stan twitter"" as if anyone who doesn't like something has to be *that* kind of fan (implication: a lesser fan). Can we please stop degrading people because they have an innocently different opinion?

If someone doesn't like this new song, or has a criticism of marketing, or whatever it is, they have that right. And they should be able to voice that opinion (politely) without being talked down to or silenced or trolled for it. If you love the song, that's amazing for you. But being a fan doesn't mean someone has to love it. Criticising something or being disappointed doesn't mean someone is an anti or a solo stan or a bad fan. It's just an opinion and it's as valid and ""necessary"" as glowing praise.

I'm just so disappointed at the things I've seen said today.",4,4,False,self,,,,,

&gt;Hello! :) If you are not a fan of BTS (ARMY) or don't know them well or didn't know them back then in their debut days, I should recommend you to watch this video ""BTS Short Movie - A Look Back"" to see how many struggles they had to deal with and what they were up to during their old days. People tend to misjudge and have a wrong view on BTS during their debut days and I'm here to prove otherwise. They were still as sweet as hardworking and as talented as they are now - they just didn't have such a large fanbase and they weren't as known..  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; In this video you will see a brief history of BTS during their first debut year - 2013. A look through BTS struggles and achievements during their different eras - ""No More Dream"", ""We Are Bulletproof Pt.2"", ""N.O"", ""Boy In Luv""and ""Just One Day"". I hope to make 5 more episodes one for each ""BTS year"" (from FESTA till FESTA) I think this would be a good chance to have a look back at BTS a few years ago and see what they were doing then, when they were still relatively small.

Welcome to the tenth part of my A Noob Listens.. series. Today is the big daddy Love Yourself: Answer I really hope I can get this done in time honestly its gonna be a struggle as I can imagine Im going to have a lot to say about it. (Yeah its fucking long as shit) So lets get right to it!

Euphoria: I fucking love this song hoy shit. I cannot get it out of my head. The lyrics are so beautiful. The acoustic guitar in the track adds this really beautiful classical element. Jungkook sounds fucking amazing here what an angel.

Trivia-Just Dance: I love this song. See this kind of song is what I would have loved to see on Hope World. The chorus explodes into your ears in such a beautiful. J-hopes flow here is great too.

Serendipity: Oh my God Jimin is going to kill me on this whole record I could already tell. Very similar feeling to Euphoria for me but maybe even more on this song. Everything from the acoustic guitar to the layered vocals in the chorus to the beautiful lyricism just really make this a 10/10 song for me. If this album keeps up at its current output right now were looking at an 11/10 here seriously I can not say enough about how much I love this song.

DNA: This song is such a jam for me. Its one of the first songs I heard BTS perform (I was watching the New Years performance) and its what got me to want to even ask my friend about them in the first place. The visuals in the music video are so stunning and I love the electronic influences in the song. Also I know the Korean isnt like this but all of these 50 cent words in the verses is really cool.

Dimple: Wow that illegal part in this chorus should be illegal its too good. Im not even sure how one can sing like that so smoothly its honestly super impressive. I feel like this song is what would happen if the wings era and the dark and wild era had a baby (in a really great way)

Trivia- Love: God I love this beat. I love the way they use piano in their songs. Sometimes they almost use the piano as a way to punctuate their sentences (like in the first verse) and it sounds bad ass. Super clever wordplay here too!

Her: Good song. Great lyrics. Only complaint is that her and tear do not rhyme I dont care if theyre not native speakers they dont rhyme lmao.

Singularity: Finally I get to express my Taehyung bias! What a guy honestly. I love the minimal instrumentation that just lets Vs voice be the center of attention here. The chord progression during the chorus is so beautiful and really conveys this sense of pain. I also love the bass here (I cant tell if its an actual bass or a synth)

FAKE LOVE: I love this song. I also love how this song can not only mean having a fake love with someone else, but also having a superficial love of yourself. Its a great message about how confidence isnt always real and true. The lyrics here are so beautiful and Im so happy this was their first top 10 here in the states!

The Truth Untold: This song is so sad but its so beautiful too. Normally Im not here for ballads but this one feels right. This song is so fucking emotional I am so shocked. Its so beautiful Jesus. I... dont even have.. proper words.. the final chorus here is fucking epic.

Trivia- Seesaw: Suga really up in here delivering bops. Not overly memorable but that might actually help its longevity for me.

Tear: Oh my god RM showing off his skills. I was actually a little worried going into this that this album would be almost entirely pop but these past two songs have definitely proven that wrong. God this song has great lyrics. Hats off to the rap line for killing it here.

Epiphany: Wow Jin who knew. From what I gathered he gets the least lines but that seems like some BS because he should definitely be getting more. He has a very very nice voice and he has a ton of emotional inflection which I think makes this song very powerful.

Im Fine: I love this song so much. The chorus explodes and immediately worms its way into your head. The actual message of the song and I can definitely see this song being a great pick me up jam to throw on maybe when youre feeling like shit and you just need some sunshine in your life.

IDOL: What a great song to shut down the haters in your life. Total anthem for self love. I really love the message of this song, and I really think it will help a lot of people, myself included. Im glad that even free everything thats gone on in their lives over the past 6 years that they arent letting it change them too much.

Answer- Love Myself: since this is the closer to the story of the series, it seems like a very fitting end. This also means Im halfway through with this reaction so I have some faith I might actually finish this on time. A really great send off. God this chorus is so great I wish I could sing that high so I could scream these lyrics because theyre great.

Magic Shop: Wow this song is great (I know I keep saying it but honestly every song on this album is great okay) Yet another wonderful EDM fueled chorus that makes me want to scream it t the top of my lungs driving on the highway with my sunroof down ( If you see anyone doing this while youre driving its me dont be afraid to say hi lol).

Best Of Me: I really love this song. This album is fucking great seriously I cannot even say enough good things. This hook is so catchy and I love the contrast between the minimal instrumentation on the verses and then the gradual build of instruments into the stop right before the hook and then it just explodes into this great groove. I lost really love Jimin and Jungkooks outro here.

Airplane Pt.2: They should have called this Ireland- but way better in every way. The vocal line kind of steals the show here not gonna lie. I especially love the breakdown before J-Hopes part and the bridge with Jimin and Suga (My dear dear bias wreckers).

Go Go Go: I think I have this dance memorized by now lmao. Super fun island beat! I cant listen to this song without thinking about Taehyung in a dress though but I dont think thats even a bad thing. This song does give me some serious anxiety over them not being responsible with their money. I really think this song is just one big joke though I mean they literally have not one but two floss breaks in their choreography.

Anpanman: This feels so 2011 rap in the best way I cannot even explain. The doubled vocals is a nice touch. No idea what the fuck an anpanman is though lmao. (Side not I just looked up what it means and I am now WAY more confused) apparently it is. This Japanese superhero and his name translates to Bread Man and he saves starving kids by letting them eat him. I mean I totally get the symbolism but seriously leave it to Japan to solve world hunger with a fucking cartoon lol.

MIC Drop: This song is so memorable. I dont think I can listen to this song without basically dancing along no matter what. I think I actually really like both single versions of this song equally. While I love the more rock influenced original, I also love the Steve Aoki version because I can sing along with the chorus and actually understand wtf theyre talking about.

134340: Wow this song is stylistically so different from anything else Ive heard on this record so far. Favorite line is Us is the plural form of u the chorus is jazzy and groovy as fuck I really like it.

Paradise: Suga steals the show here for sure. I dont know what more I can say here. Its groovy and smooth as fuck and I love it.

So What: Oof this song is a party jam if Ive ever heard one. Im nodding my head vigorously right now. This is one thing I really love about BTS is that they can write these great party anthems but they also have incredible lyricism and great messages which is super rare for pop music these days.

Pied Piper: Dang BTS really pulled a pied piper on me over the past two weeks thats for sure! RMs verse in the beginning is literally my friend honestly thats about to be me a year from now isnt it. Also this chorus is great and once again Im gonna say how much I love the bass synth here.

Overall Thoughts/ Review:
God I fucking loved this album. I know at this point if any of there albums are overhyped its this one but I dont think I care. It might be more poppy but it doesnt pull any punches in the rap department and delivers everything from party jams like Mic Drop and Anpanman to beautiful ballads like Serendipity and The Truth Untold. I absolutely love everything about this album and its a very very clear perfect score from me!

A Noob Rates: 10/10

Please join me as I listen to Mono tomorrow and any tracks I missed the next day! I have had an incredible time doing this series and I hope youve all enjoyed it! let me know what you thought of this album below.

I tried googling for some past attempts and there appears to have some (a petition, a plan for mass requesting from specific stations), but I can't see where anything came of it. I'm interested in thoughts about why not, apart from my own, and thoughts about trying again. 

BTS has been on the radio before. I know for me, here in Virginia, Fake Love played for a little while on K92 right after the BBMAs. I've seen an Amino post about Not Today playing on 94.9 in the San Francisco Bay area and KJ103 in Oklahoma has played BTS. Anyone else have examples?

&amp;#x200B;

Doing something to try and get the boys onto the radio here in the states more sounds like it would be fun on top of showing that ARMY support. I'm about 2 years into the glory that is BTS and I want to show more support. Granted, I don't really know what it takes to accomplish that. Mass, targeted requesting? I don't know.

Books, music, movies, clothes, food, museums, whatever you've been doing that you think they would enjoy as well! 

BTS- I recently saw Gershwin's ""An American in Paris"" performed live and I think as a whole would really resonate with the concept of being in a foreign place trying to take it all in and being a little homesick. And they were recently in Paris so it might also be able to remind them of their time there!

Namjoon- the Dispossessed by Ursula Le Guin. I didn't know some of their lyrics came from another one of Le Guin's works until I saw a comment here recently, so now I am really sure he would like this book! I think some problems Shevek faces would feel familiar to Namjoon and I think he would enjoy how the story progresses. It feels more real than other sci-fi I've read.

What I wrote in the original post: 

*""Crazy story... So my friend who is an ARMY went to the middle of nowhere for research on caimans (not exactly sure what the heck she was doing, something about taping their jaw and wrestling with them), and was without internet for a good 8 months. She comes back looking like a cavewoman - hairy legs and all - and texts me a picture of BTS on Times with the lovely caption ""WTF?!!!"" She's now asking me what she's missed and I honestly don't know what to tell her...""*

Back in early February this year, my friend went happily off into the jungle where internet was either non-existent or crazy expensive. She returned a week ago and after crying over flush toilets and toilet paper for a few days, she finally remembered that she has unlimited data again and decides to check up on the boys. As you can imagine...she was slapped in the face with a ridiculous amount of info. She literally thought she had encephalitis or had ended up in an alternative reality written by BTS fans. She was so confused and couldn't figure out what was real (she thought the pics with S. Korean president and Times cover were photoshopped like all the Namkanda and Obama pics) so asked me for help. 

Since then I have informed her of:

BTS on Billboard Magazine, Hixtape, Burn the Stage, Face Yourself, Euphoria/Love Yourself Wonder, Singularity/Fake Love, BBMA Comeback + Top social artist award, Love Yourself Tear , #1 Billboard 200, #10 Hot 100, Letter from President, Festa, Epiphany, IDOL with Nicki, Love Yourself Answer, #1 Billboard 200 again, #11 Hot 100, World Tour Sold Out, Citi Field sold out, AGT, UN speech, Jimmy Fallon, Good Morning America, Times Magazine, Jungkook Hurting Foot, Graham Norton, Paris + meeting S.K President, BTS cultural merit, Mono, WIOM with Aoki. 

I honestly believe this is the closest I will ever get to fulfilling that fantasy of time traveling to tell young BTS of their glorious future. 

I'm exhausted, she's exhausted. She's a crying mess right now and is currently rewatching Namjoon's UN speech for the 100th time today (he's her bias). I know I missed things...What did I miss? ",62,1,False,self,,,,,

1) Jin is struggling against adulthood and wants his youth back. The other boys are the embodiment of differwnt aspects of adulthood and as they die Jin becomes to realise that he has to accept adulthood.

2) Jin had actually died before 'I Need U' and all 6 of his friends are now depressed with this fact. They are upset to the point that they even try to commit sins like suicide and killing.

In 1 scene Jin is alone in his photo and in one scene from the bath tub, Jimin is holding a photo with only 6 boys present by the sea (excluding Jin).

Does anyone know why?  The folks on youtube seemed to think that they didn't want to show his abs, but gosh,  we see abs all the time in kpop.  I can't see how the mere fact of having abs is a problem.  

My theories are either that he has tattoos (which often get pixellated on Korean TV shows), or that he had abdominal surgery at some point and has scars that they don't want his fans to see.

They have given me hope and acceptance in a time of need for which I am super grateful for and I could not ask for a better group of artists to stan.

The main topics I wanted to discuss is whether BTS will ever crack the mainstream US market. At the moment BTS have done EXCEPTIONALLY well with their western acheivements; #10 on BB100 and two #1 BB200 albums! This is no easy feat as we all know. However, this has all come from ARMYs efforts and the GP are still having a hard time to come across BTS. Longevity on the BB100 charts is something we strive for but the rabid fanbase we have means our singles stay high for a couple of days and then rapidly drop. (At least we can stay at the top position though) eg current case with Waste It On Me. If the GP aren't getting into BB100 I find it very difficult that this will change in the future. 

Another point I wanted to make is the intensity that ARMYs have can sometimes come across as very polarising and in my opinion can hinder people's thoughts. I know we all care for BTS but spamming YouTube or spamming Spotify on Twitter for more playlists, I'd think this would annoy them? E.g. spamming Spotify on Twitter daily for the streams that they have taken away from us?  We've seen it already with radios and we are generally seen as THAT fandom which could mean BTS music is one further step away from being played or playlisted because some of us can be annoying.

I'm very thankful for BTS output and if they can't make the US market then I've come to the realisation that I don't need to beat myself up for this and accept it. They're already a force to be reckoned with and maybe I should be happy with what they have at the moment because it's not something every group has. If I've said something to upset anyone I sincerely apologise but I say this all with BTS in mind and I would love to see what everyone on here thinks!",82,1,False,self,,,,,

I want to apologize for my last post regarding my Live Photos. I feel bad pricing them the way they were priced, but I was assuming folks would prefer airmail rather than surface. That being said, I'm still selling them; I kind of need to. I'm in a bit of a tight situation and would love to get rid of some stuff. I'm also taking orders on BT21 Merch. Let me know if my prices are wonky, I did some research before making this post and would be more than happy to price accordingly.    
**One very important note**, everything here is being shipped via *surface mail*. It is boxed and you will get a tracking number, it's just that very slow shipping that takes awhile to get to you (as your item(s) goes on a boat rather than a plane). I'm assuming you'll get it by Christmas as the holiday rush hasn't started yet. You're more than welcome to inquire about airmail, but I warn you the prices were enough to get me downvoted on my last post ~~(I'm obviously too sensitive for Reddit because it hurt).~~ P:  
  
(The price you see on everything includes shipping).  
Live Photos: $32 USD, $18 USD per additional set.

BT21 Goods (These are picked up by order. If there's something you want that isn't listed, you're more than welcome to ask for a quote. I more or less have an idea on the price of everything.):  
 ""Lying Down Plushie"" - $50  
 Standing Dolls (The Boxed Plushies) - $58  
 Bag Charms/Head Charms (The Mini Plush Keychains. They're either full body or just the head.) - $32  
 Bag Charms (Full body plastic keychain.) - $32  
 Hand Sanitizer (The holder + the gel itself.) - $23  
 Plastic Water Bottle w/ Sleeve - $35  
 Phone Grips (In the shape of the character's face) - $35
 Thermos Bottle - $48
 Slippers (The fuzzy ones, not the ajumma plastic ones. These suckers are expensive unfortunately.) - $50  
 Christmas Socks (These high-key look like Undertale characters, my heart.) - $25  
 Monopoly Pin Badge - $30  
 Paris Baguette Mugs - $28  
 Paris Baguette Tumblers - $38  
  
**Please double check LINE's official Amazon first! Your shipping rates would be much cheaper if they have this stuff stocked in your country. I'm obviously just a person and don't run any sort of business or have things set up with the post office, so my rates are regular consumer rates.**  
  
For multiple items purchased I will discount shipping depending on weight differences. Obviously if you buy three standing dolls the weight of each box hits the limit for the next price jump, but if it's a larger item and a smaller item the discount will be greater as it shouldn't tip the scale too much. :)  
Please feel free to ask me any questions. Thank you!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

What are your thoughts on this ~~mixtape~~ playlist? What about Namjoon's growth as an artist? What songs stood out to you the most? And what do you think mono stands for? Monologue? Monotone? Monochrome? Monopoly? Monophobia? Monomania? Or just mono...? Just a reminder if you want other people to respect your opinion, be polite in expressing it.

In 2018 Seasons Greetings, RM told us to [look at the sky for at least 10 minutes](https://i.imgur.com/jZfKdxH.png) on October 23rd, which turned out to be the release date of mono. We didnt quite hit 40k in time for that, but let's do this now:

I really want to go watch Burn the stage when it comes out, but I don't know anyone who is Army in Ottawa and I don't want to go alone, I feel like the experience would be much better if I go with other Army! 

So I was wondering, so there anyone else who's also going alone and would like to tag along? I swear I'm very friendly and not a murderer or something.

I ask this because I feel like there is a certain quality to their songs, both sonically and lyrically, that I can instantly identify as theirs. However, I can't really find the words to explain it in depth. On a base level, their main genre would be hip-hop and the lyricism to be mainly grand and metaphorical.

&amp;#x200B;

Song Jae-kyung, the vocalist of 9 and the Numbers, a Korean indie band that has been around for 9 years, talked about BTS in the band's recent interview. He co-wrote the lyrics for 'Paradise.'

&amp;#x200B;

When asked about the concerns over their popular appeal, Song answered:

I personally had an opportunity to co-write the lyrics for 'Paradise,' a song of BTS. And I found a new possibility there. We also did a collaboration with a Hong-Kong-based band, and I came to think that we should actively do collaborations with musicians who have different colors from ours. No matter how hard we try by ourselves, we cannot get away from the indie color. And there is no need to get away from it. We will take any commercial offer that comes to us.

&amp;#x200B;

When asked about his thoughts on collaborating with BTS, Song said:

It was a new experience. I found a new creative direction that our band can pursue. Now that it been has initiated, we will actively try to work with other musicians.The achievement BTS has made cannot be denied or denigrated by anyone. Professional musicians ultimately have to prove themselves with achievements-- BTS' achievements cannot be matched or followed by anyone across genre and time, through the past decades and the future. Their agency, BigHit Entertainment, had thorough strategies and plans. And when I looked into the way the members create (music) and express (themselves), I could see that they are a team that is ready and I was impressed by it. ",7,1,False,self,,,,,

I was immediately drawn to V because of that sultry voice, his striking look and his bashfulness. Honestly I've been living for his solos in Blood Sweat and Tears.

All of a sudden, I began to pay more attention to Kim Seokjin. Began to appreciate his piercing voice. And then I discovered the Jin dad jokes, his goofy videos and his rants and honestly I don't know how I went this long without it. 

So, there really isn't anything deep here. I just wanted to thank Jin for my current existential crisis.

While I know its not ideal, Im someone who likes to move away from their mistakes after theyve learned what was wrong with it and I tend to do the same for other people as well. For that reason, I cant bring myself to watch no more dream (and to a lesser extent we are bulletproof). The use of black culture as a shallow aesthetic makes me pretty uncomfortable. I also cant bring myself to watch boy in luv because of their annoyingly adamant behaviour (when jin and yoongi touch the girl MY BLOOD BOILS I GET SET TO FLY TO KOREA AND GIVE THEM AN HOUR LONG LECTURE EVERY TIME). The only other video I cant bring myself to watch is war of hormone because seeing jungkook say yes im a bad boy so i like bad girls makes me squirm uncomfortably 100x more than just hearing it (im also not a big fan of the lyrics of that song in general). 

What about you, do you have any videos you cant bring yourself to watch (whether it be because of personal taste or a moral problem you have with it)? Or is this just a me problem?
