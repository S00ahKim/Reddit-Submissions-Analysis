Today isn't a special BTS related anniversary date to me. I'm just a person who can pretty get into any song provided I listen to it enough times! (yes even meme music. I also have a ton of free time because term just ended and I don't want to study for another 5 years.) So I want to take this opportunity to go through Bangtan's Discography and give every song some love! So here goes MOTS: Persona!

Disclaimer: I apologise for the very not music terms underneath, definitely not a music major or anything. Also apologies if stuff doesn't make sense...

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro: Persona**

Namjoon's personal intro track for the album. Can we just talk about how fire the backing track/beat is? They took the Intro: Skool Luv Affair beat and upped it to even more hype! Steady drum in the back, and the voice going 'yeah yeah yeah' are so fire I could listen to just the beat alone for hours. But then you have  killer Namjoon rap coming in, with such a slick flow that smoothly transitions. I love how unique Namjoon's rap is, it's just so *him*. After the first part and chorus, there's a slight pause, with some classic RM narration. I love it. (*I don't know man. but I know one thing*.)  And then it's straight back into rap and extreme headbanging. It transitions so perfectly into the PERSONA! for the last chorus, where you get extreme *WHO THE HELL AM I? I JUST WANNA GO. I JUST WANNA FLY*. The beat then wraps up and cuts off before the last word, and boom. The song has finished and you wouldn't have known it was 3 minutes except for the fact your head was sore from extreme headbanging. One of my favourites this album. I love the callback to 'old' Bangtan, how it uses pretty much the same beat. It's also so interesting to hear how much he's improved over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Boy With Luv (feat. Halsey)**

What a feel good song. You start with some classic catchy 'oooa oooa oooa oooa' and you can practically see the chores in mind. Then we get some killer vocals from vocal line, with Halsey in the background. I really like how they give vocal line the first verse. It draws you (and newer fans) in with sweet vocals in preparation for the chorus and prechorus. The chorus is not too 'heavy' or 'hype', it's just a simple, fun and happy melody. And then we get some rap! Low voice Yoongi rap sounds amazing, and very much suits the beat change (some crystal thing in the background). It then transitions perfectly to Hoseok's sing-song type of rap, which helps bring it back to the prechorus. Also need to mention how good Namjoon's voice is with V for the '*(geuttae niga naege jwossdeon du nalgaero)'* part! Riding on the Namjoon train, he carries the bridge like nobody's business. It sounds especially good with the chords in the back, making it sound progressive, and leading up to the final chorus. And lemme say, Jungkook's adlibs in the final chorus are so good. Especially live. Do I need to say more?

&amp;#x200B;

**Mikrokosmos**

Mikrokosmos is magical. The very first second you hear the melody in the beat, you know, you're in for some sort of mystical, fantastical ride. The different vocal sound (softer and more breathy) Jungkook and V have in the start certainly help reinforce that idea too. I especially love the first rap line verse here. It's short and sweet, and has J-hope, RM and Suga. But my favourite part of this song has to be vocal line. They pull off the prechorus and chorus so nicely. I don't know how to describe the first chorus, except for JK's and Jimin's voices sound amazing. Not to mention they do the multiple voice thing for the 'oh oh' that really makes you feel like one big community. Ok never mind, Namjoon rap and Yoongi rap has come back to reclaim their spots as the best part in the song. Oh wait, here comes V and JK's vocals. And then Jin chorus? I'm dead. But JOKES, have you heard the bridge???? In all seriousness, Mikrokosmos sounds like a big fantastical journey, but everyone is there with you. The last chorus is insanely good, with an outburst of melody from the '*Shine. Dream. Smile*' to the group '*Na na na na*'. The song seemingly ends abruptly, but it's somehow fitting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Make it Right**

From the minute I heard the beat, I knew Ed Sheeran was involved somehow. I can't be the only one who thinks it is just such an Ed Sheeran beat right? Well, I'm going to cheat and use [The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Live Version of Make it Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8IA_tCM-Qk), because vocals are heavenly there. Live voices best voices. We start with some good Jhope 'ays', before V comes in with such a smooth voice.. Sucks you into the song so quickly. Jimin then has such a high, soothing voice.  At this rate I'm going to literally just say vocal line makes every line heavenly (they do) so Imma skip a bit and do more highlights. 1:17, the entire vocal line does the chorus, which sounds amazing before 1:27 kicks in with killer harmony. Then best vocal Jhope comes in at 1:36, with clarity and stableness that blows you off your feet. Jhope vocals are always best vocals. 1:54, we have live RM rap. I don't know how to describe it, but it's just steadily, live, and somehow better than the studio version. RM rap is just consistently amazing. 2:13, I feel like a sports commentator almost, we have KILLER JIN VOCALS. Breathy, beautiful falsetto, + Namjoon back up. Jimin proceeds to kill it. 2:31 I'm pretty much dying because JK sounds so clear I and ethereal I've just died several times over. 3:07 we have Yoongi rap with JK vocal backup. Do I even need to say more??? Overall, this song is chill, and 100% superior live. (tbf literally everything is haha)

&amp;#x200B;

**HOME**

Fan favourite, and considerably so. What a good song. Groovy as hell, sick beat. The beat is very 'obvious' and pronounced, especially that bass. That bass. Is so good. Everyone always pays attention to the vocals, that we sometimes forget to appreciate a good beat. And this is some good shizz. Namjoon with the first rap verse is never a mistake. Such a groovy rap for a groovy song. Vocal line is amazing as usual, with Jimin having different 'voices' (start one is more defined, latter more breathy) for the start of the song and the prechorus. Then we get the chorus. What a melody. It's so catchy, with the whole 'mi casa'. Then you get the 'Ho-u-o-u-o-u-o-u-ome'. I just love it so much. Then everything quiets down and you get the 'your love your love your love'. It's soft, and such a change in tone. And then straight back into fire rap line. Jhope with his rhythmic rhymes, Yoongi with his typical low flow. One thing about HOME, is that it's always busy. There's always a dominant vocal or rap, on top of a busy beat, and with constant adlibs near the end. It's a pleasure to the ears and I love it. Interestingly, V seems to end it almost synthetically. I don't really know how to describe his last 'I love it', but it's different, and really defines the ending.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jamais Vu**

I love this song. So much. It's produced so amazingly. It starts perfectly. Any song that straight up starts with Jin, is automatically good. His nasal ballads voice, sets the tone of the song perfectly. And before we go further, lemme emphasise the beat. If you haven't heard this song with earphones, please do. The pulsing sound at the start moves from ear to ear, and is really just magical. A more vocal than rap Jhope comes in, and you really start to feel the somberness of the song. It's sad. But then, out of nowhere, the beat changes. There's a weird dissonance, and JK comes in. It switches to major. ( I think pls correct if wrong). The vocals are off the charts, and they (the song) sound pained. Pleading for a remedy. The melody (of 'Please give me a remedy) seems like it'll go up ,but goes down. It continues on. The beat starts to pick up. And then rapper Jhope comes in with strong bass. Killing the rap like usual. By the time the second chorus comes in, the song is no longer sad. It's hopeful. Strong Jin vocals cut in. Will they get a remedy? They melody goes down again. It's a long, drawn out 'remedy'. It's the bridge, the last desperation. The second last chorus plays. And it is here, that the melody finally goes up. The final chorus plays. Jhope joins in, rapping the background rap. And then it ends. 'I won't give up.' The beginning pulses play again, but this time, with ticks. Clock ticks, that signify the time passing. And just like the song is over. Jamais Vu is a masterpiece. Jin's ballad voice, coupled with Jungkook's versatile voice and Jhope's ability to do a more emotional, vocal rap and a 'harder' more 'rap' rap is what makes this song possible. And it's marvellous.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dionysus**

If producer Jhope hadn't already awed you with killer production in Jamais Vu. Oh boy. Dionysus is a heavy hitting, (rock?) absolute banger. As I've said, starting with Namjoon rap is never a bad idea. He is the commanding leader he is and you can hear it. Low vocals and Jhope being hype as hell. Killer chorus. Alcohol. Oh low vocals weren't enough? Here, have Jimin singing high 'rock' vocals as well. V and JK kill second verse. Jhope returns to claim his song with a perfectly fitting rap. 'Where the party at?' 'Everyone all, fall, fall into this crazy artist'. And song. Also. You know how Yoongi's backup dancers are just kinda nodding their head during his part? Same. And then Namjoon asking us if 'We're ready to get hyped up?' Yes. Just yes. Jin channels his inner rock star. Things are going down. We have Jhope personally deliver the last part of the song with his mature voice, only to be closed out by rock Jin. The song is chaotic, has ended, and it's an amazing ride. But of course this wouldn't be a ramble without a comment about the beat! Obvious, heavy drum beats, chaotic synths, this song is truly drunk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall**

What a great album. You start with a fire track, progress to a feel happy song, to chill songs. Then sudden hip hop, a ballad out of no where. And then you end with absolute chaos. 

&amp;#x200B;

Congrats for making it to the end, or skipping it. Either way, thank you for reading. Hopefully this was bearable to read, and maybe some of you share my sentiments. What do you think of the songs in this album? Your favourites? I'd love to discuss with you!",0,0,False,self,,,,,

I got Weply so I could buy things from BigHit and take advantage of all the points I've accumulated. I have almost 4000 points now that I've been religiously scanning into my account on the BigHit shop. 

I always log in to the BigHit shop using my Gmail account. I click to log in with Gmail then click my account and tadah, easy as pie. 

When I went to Weply I was also given the opportunity to login using my Gmail account... But when I did it it told me no account under that email exists and had me make a new one. I thought fair enough it must be because it's a new company. 

But for some reason NONE of my points transferred over. I tried rescanning the QR codes into the app but of course they've already been used so the codes are void. 

I've been contacting the Weply customer service now for 5 weeks. Every time I have to make a new enquiry to reply to their last, and it takes them a week to respond. They've been utterly useless. First they weren't reading my messages correctly and giving me irrelevant advice and when I finally got them to listen, they told me that there is no account on BigHit under that email (which is a complete lie, I literally logged in 5 minutes ago) and then when I disputed this they told me to prove that I have an account on that email. I have no idea how to prove it. Can anyone tell me? 

Why aren't my points transferring? Does anyone else who uses Gmail login have a similar experience? Does BigHit not have a proper system to register Gmail logins?

I noticed recently that whenever something is released, I dont get a chance to actually absorb much of it, because I quickly have to focus on another thing that is being revealed/released. 

Example: BTS World soundtrack and new MV came out. BTS World was released. Weverse revealed. TXT interaction. BTS memories 2018 revealed. Run. Lights/Japanese BwL this weekend. 

All of these things happened/will happen in the span of one week or a little bit more

Not even counting the collaborations for BT21

Dont get me wrong, Im so glad that were being well fed, but I feel like I cant enjoy the taste because Im swallowing quickly waiting for the next bite...  weird analogy I know...

Im sure theres someone out there who think BTSs pre-debut history is just like it is in the game, but in truth its pretty far from reality. Its sort of like a fan fiction in which the members have their personalities and talents, but not much else is the same?

As an obvious example, BTS definitely wouldnt have all met each other at 2012 and debut in 2013. RM was in BigHit since 2010 and Yoongi came in through a rap battle. There were also the original members in the line up that decided to leave after finding out it would be an idol group.

So yes, most of it is really just a... story. But I feel like there are also little moments that are pulled from reality? Yoongi asking if there was any chance he could be a producer, which was probably something he actually did ask at one point. Namjoon being Runch Randa. Jimin being a modern dancer. I wonder if the members were actually cold to each other in the beginning? And if they were actually as opposed to their group name as they were in the game

This was also the same scenario during the BTS doll release. It just feels uncomfortable that even this level of freedom of speech is restrained just to ensure everything looks sparkly clean from the outside. The whole point of Twitter was to share thoughts and opinions, so it was unsettling to be told to avoid posting criticism on the platform. While we all love BTS, one should not forget that in the core, this fan-idol relationship is still some sort of extension of a business relationship. We are consumers and we pay for a lot of the content they produce, so it is natural that there will be feedback and discussion surrounding it. In a sense, circumspect opinions is a good thing because it shows casuals that the fandom is prudent and allows the companies involved in the product creation to do better.

Another is how it's almost taboo to even discuss about the budding enlistment or the inevitable solo paths of the boys. Actual discussion about said topic might actually even help the fandom learn how to deal and cope with it when the time comes (it's unavoidable that their solo successes would be of varying levels in the long term, and fandom needs to learn to deal with that) but even the big accounts who should spearhead such discussions are the ones who are the first to shoot it down whenever it is brought up.

There seems to be a lot of policing about what are the acceptable things to talk about in the fandom, even regarding things which aren't rooted in hate to begin with. I feel it's an essential progress that needs to happen to help the fandom mature in the most real sense.",157,140,False,self,,,,,

Utilizing his fluent English and being praised by media around the world for his smart responses that make use of the members personalities, leader RM is an existence also indispensable to BTS music making process.

I used to think that Hip Hop and R&amp;B were the best music ever. But as 10yeats have gone by since I started making music, Ive come to think that classifying genres is meaningless. Lately I often check the world charts and take in everything, as if Im just breathing. I actually like lyrical types of music, so I listen to Korean and Japanese indie music too.

Theres been a lot of talk over the new album that included Halsey and Ed Sheeran. For songs of course, but Halsey was practicing the dance so hard that when I frankly told her I never wouldve even thought that America, and Halsey whos in the frontlines of the world, would work this hard just for us, she told me countries dont matter. Pls continue working with many more people, without holding any preconceptions and that was the most memorable thing I remember

At the BBMAs that took place in May, he finally met his inspiration, Drake! With an expression that couldnt hide his happiness, he said the moment I met him, I yelled The GOD!. Drake told me you guys are the most famous people in America right now. That made me so happy!

Connecting with artists around the world, and being in a lifestyle touring around many countries, there apparently have been changes in value unrelated to music. Natural things...like trees or parks, pictures and exhibitions of nature, Ive started to like those kinds of things more, and felt them closer to my heart. I actually am a fan of the Japanese artist Hiroshi Senjus art.

In LA, RM visited the atelier of a popular artist Coarse, and seems to have been deeply impressed by it. I noticed that when you see the process of creation and hear explanations, youre able to become more fond of the work. I felt that if I was able to decently communicate the process of my music creation from now on, there would somehow be positive things coming from it

[Jin](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146095077447520256?s=20)

Worldwide handsome. Saying the catch phrase he named himself, and vivifying stages around the world and American tv shows, you cant really imagine that hes actually shy. Im shy of strangers, and Im sad that I couldnt really get to talk with Halsey a lot...but when we danced for the first time during the MV shoot, it was really fun. BTS has this tradition of whispering in tiny voices RM, J-HOPE,... right before our performances on the dark stage, but we also said Halseys name at the BBMAs. This relaxed everyones tensions

Touring in different countries around the world, he apparently was able to truly feel the diversity for himself. Every country enjoys concerts in a different way, and its not just the food and culture. Some places sing along, while others quietly listen to our voices. In France, they cheer us on by stomping their feet on the ground

When asked what was significant in the path leading to the world, he answers it partly has to do with the music, but also how the members always had discussions, and worked hard. Ms English skills were also critical. But the most important thing was the existence of the fans that supported our passion. Because the fans enjoy us, I feel like I can forget my fatigue and keep on running on. But Im not thinking about the future. Thats bc theres no need to think of a faraway future when were so filled with happiness being with ARMYS around the world, right now Even now when BTS existence has grown this big, he simply states Im just a person. Im merely a human that makes up this world, but when I step one foot outside, Im treated as a star that was on TV. To be honest, I cant deny that I feel pressure in that way. I dont think Im the type to be able to handle everything. But, I have my members. Thats why were able to go face the world with all our force.

For a short while in America, he took a break from being a star, and went to an amusement park. The photo he uploaded of him on a rollercoaster was talked about a lot. Thats not me making a weird face. Everyone makes that face when theyre on a rollercoaster (laugh)

[V](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146085832605892609?s=20)

The stadium tour that becomes polished as performances go by. The secret, according to V, lies within the discussions between the members. 30 min before the concert, we check the things we need to improve for all the songs on our setlist together. Everyone enthusiastically gives their opinions. We dont spend as much time on the solos as the group songs, but Jimin complimented me that I was cool while rehearsing for Rose Bowl, and I was able to do well

Living as a BTS member that captivated the world. V earnestly talks about the reality of it. Ive spent most of my life as BTS V. On one hand Im happy that Vs existence grew much larger than what I was dreaming of, but there are also times that I want to live as Kim Taehyung. Like, eating yummy Korean food with family. But the cheers that ARMYs send us with a smile are our happiness, right now. Im able to relax during the concerts, since Im making memories with people (armys) that are like family to me. This moment, right here, is my utmost moment of youth! This is just an If, but even if the cheers become smaller in the future, as long as ARMYs voices exist, our happiness will continue on

The Rose Bowl performance also seems to have become a huge memory for V. That sensation cant be understood without standing on that stage, but bc of that performance, all my pressures and worries blew away. The emotions, fervor, ARMYs passion that completely surpassed my imaginations...I received it all and went back to the hotel, and cried alone on my bed that night. Ive never cried that many happy tears as that night. I fell asleep though, so my eyes were swelling when I woke up (laugh)

Are there any parts of yourself that you dont like, even though youre always full of confidence on the stage? (shrinking shoulders)...I cant speak English. So I can only predict the Qs and memorize the answers that I thought up. Im so embarrassed that I want to cover my face. But, Im moved that ARMYs all over the world transcended nationalities and languages to love us, and Im really thankful for that

[Jungkook](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146101270526087168?s=20)

Through experiences like the BBMAs, going up on the stage to present for the Grammys, collab stages with Charlie Puth, and seeing Ariana Grandes concert, Jungkook says his passion for the stage increased even more. The more I watch other artists performances, the more I want to do on stage. Its an honor to be able to enjoy while receiving inspiration and stimulations. Before her concert, I told Ariana theres a lot of things I want to learn from watching your concert. Yeah, we also gather before our performances start and pull ourselves together, and she was doing the same thing. She called on to me to say lets do it together and she let me into her circle. I had a lot to think about after the concert, and I searched up foreign vocals and how to do vocal exercises and practiced in my hotel room. My throat actually still hurts a bit (laugh)

When asked if hes been working on studying English lately, he answers Im not even up to a middle schoolers level yet though shyly with his crushed eye smile, while continuing on that hes felt with his skin that you need language to succeed around the world. Even in concerts abroad, the fans sing along to our songs in Korean. Im truly grateful for that. It made me want to keep on studying languages without giving up, to be able to express my thoughts in my own words

Btw, anything youve learned from interacting with many artists? When I meet them, they interact with me in a lighthearted mood as if were friends, rather than talking seriously about music. When you listen to their songs after re-acknowledging what their personalities are actually like, you can sometimes understand their worldviews more. Words are important, but as for music, you also learn by feeling a lot too What is to JK, a happiness for BTS after connecting with the world? If I had to choose...I want to keep on doing concerts as BTS and enjoying ourselves. Thats bc I feel the happiest in those moments. I hope the fans feel the same way!

# Short Answers

RM

[Jin](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146089140280102912?s=20)

Q: a word u recently searched up on the internet? A:the drama Walking Dead. I was confused over who died, and I searched it up to review the story. I cant stop if I start watching, so I havent been able to play my fav game recently.

Q: a part of yourself you think as an imperfection or flaw? A: when Im playing games. When I fail at the moment when youre supposed to win 90% of the time, I writhe in agony, carrying my head like why dont I have any luck! (laugh). Another flaw is when Im unable to wake up from my bed on the weekend, even though I can wake up without an alarm for work.

[SUGA](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146103901877260288)

Q: what would you do if you suddenly were free for 48 hours? A: recently, I lost my self identification card in the dorm (laugh). I think I would spent that time preparing to reissue the documents. It might seem normal, but to me, I dont really do this on a daily basis, so its a special thing.

Q: whos your hero, or how would you define one? A: I feel like heroes are all around us. Firefighters or police officers, a hero might be a dad or mom to someone. for me, its the fans. Theres only meaning because there are people who listen to the music. If no one listened, it would merely be a noise.

[V](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146081411767529473?s=20)

Q. Who is your hero or how do you define one? TH: My dad. When I was little, he often gave me coins that he had next to the drivers seat. At that time, I rlly thought he was a superhero. When I bought tteokbokki or snacks with the coins, I felt rich (haha)

Q. Something memorable while interacting with artists? TH: I was so happy to get a bracelet from Halsey that I went 2 the BBMAs with it on. The members n I r still discussing what to give back to her. Personally, bc shes an artist, I think an ear monitor or mic would be optimal.

# A Moment You Felt Mentally Connected with the Members

Its really nothing big, but the moment Jin said I want to eat Copchan last night, I said oh me too\~! and we went to eat it together (laugh). It was so delicious I was about to cry!

[Jin](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146110693734617088?s=20)

V started doing a game Id been recommending to him for years, so we connect with e/o through the games he often asks me so you play this part like \*this\*?. But I low-key feel like he shouldve started the game when I recommended it to him if hes so into it now(laugh).

[SUGA](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146109223480127488?s=20)

I think with J-Hope. Im bad at making eye contact, but during a BWL performance, theres a part where I need to make eye contact with J-Hope. Idk what hes thinking during it, but we laugh too hard every single time (laugh).

[j-hope](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146109225673752576?s=20)

When I first listened to BWL! Even though we all have different music tastes and pursue different styles, we all agreed that we had to release this song. Things like this actually happen a lot, making me think we connect to each other.

[Jimin](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146109221760466944?s=20)

When we realized that we all had worries and fears regarding this tour, and got over them by comforting e/o. Also, when I asked wanna go watch Avengers Endgame? And Jungkook replied yeah, I also wanted to watch it!

[V](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146086499273732096?s=20)

When everyone at Rose Bowl turned on their smartphone lights, I felt like I was watching stars shining in space. In that moment I thought of how the members were watching the same scenery with the same feeling, which I felt when I made eye contact with them, and I got even more moved.

[Jungkook](https://twitter.com/k00kceptional/status/1146105223808602114?s=20)

When I naturally made eye contact with Jimin and high fived him after the concert. I feel like we connect in some way, especially on the stage. Aside from that we eat pigs feet and he tells me the games hes into (haha)",80,238,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

This is a review by a gaming reporter (an ahjussi in his 30's), who aren't familiar with the BTS members.    I thought it was fun to read so I tried translating it.  :)  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you don't take it too seriously and enjoy reading. (Please don't argue about the game being female/male targeted here, since that's been done many other times on other posts).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**BTS World experience 1:   First impression of the members in a man in his 30's, trying very hard to not cringe. (Review of BTS raising game)**

&amp;#x200B;

""The inevitable time has come.""

On the evening of 26th, this was my thought as BTS world server opened.   I had flashbacks of the times I had confidently told my colleagues that I will withstand this game.  My colleague reporters were already fallen from not being able to tolerate the previews before the game came out.  It was up to me to do it. 

Honestly, I had confidence. One time, I had been exposed and survived a lot of other examples while doing reasearch on the market targeted at female gamers.  I even did a bit of prep work doing the Superstar BTS game.  I tend to listen to idol songs regardless of gender if the songs are good.  I pressed play.  BTS, my friends, since I'm the manager, you're gonna have a full schedule.

BTS world is a cinematic simulation game of upbringing, collecting and exchange.  In the play, the story takes a large portion and the data volume of the game is beyond imagination.

The play is similar to Chinese female oriented dating simluations Love and Producer by Paper Games.  To share phone calls, text, and communcate by SNS as well as to clear missions with card levels.  In conclusion, you need powers of fighting against the evils of cringe.  Although the manager that keeps trying to cross the line made me a bit nervous, I tried to pick the most rational choices and build my affinity.

I thought I would be able to withstand it, but it wasn't easy.  The beginning was especially a bit of a crisis.  Why do we get one liners on a shiny background of things like, copper tanned skin, charismatic eyes or skin like white jade?  In addition, these are not even about fictional characters but of people who actually exist....

(Writing this while squirming and wailing)

&amp;#x200B;

While playing this game, I focused on the game system as much as possible and regained my calm.  ""I'm just a gamer that is raising up fictional characters.  2012 is just another universe that the protagonist fell in.  It's just another possible past of the 14 million pasts that Dr. Strange saw.""  Self-hypnosis with these thoughts gave me peace. 

I had noticed it while playing SuperstarBTS as well, but it's not easy to tell people apart when they're all styled like an album cover.  Many men don't really pay attention to faces of other men.  It was my first  hurdle to become an Army.  ""Army will know who they are even by looking at their shadows.""  As if to say this, there were a lot of UX design that didn't tell me the name of the character.  As a biginner, I had no choice but to learn them. 

Finally, after learning the face and characters of the BTS members, I'm writing down the initial impressions of the 7 members.  These are just personal impressinon.  I'm up to chapter 5 of the story. 

**JIN**:  He seems like a protagonist in a romantic comedy.  With elegant impression and figure, he is an ideal of a hansom man.  There are not many things in the world that men hate as much as actual handom men saying they're handsome all the time.  But whenver he opens his mouth, there is something not quite all there about him.  This must be his unexpected charms.  He was so unexpectedly funny, that I ended up actually laughing out loud a number of times.  His character as the luxury version of the common neighbourhood hyung is quite unique as well. 

**SUGA**:  He seems to be the tsendere rule enforcer.  During Another Story, the genre suddenly changes into Beethoven Virus (K-drama).  He becomes suddenly the most serious person in the world when music comes up as a topic.  Did they say a man who has focus on his work is sexy?  He seemed to hate Bangtan Sonyeondan group name the most. I understand him.  If you think he's a bit too sensitive, he shows his caring side while pretending to be not caring.  It felt like a female heroine from a typical male-targeted game had gotten swept in a storm and fell into a typical female-targeted game.

**J-HOPE**:  Even when he is not in the centre of attention, I could see he was always smiling.  He doesn't say things that stand out too much.  He has the aura of being able to mingle and get along well, no matter which group he falls into.  In the game, he seems to be the type of subcharacter that is protagonist's brother or hoobae that cheerfully leads the protagonist a few times.  His cards especially seem to have poses that express ""I'm cute.""

**RM**:  He showed charisma even from the beginning of the game.  If I met him in real life, I would probably call him ""hyung.""  In reality, anyone who seems more powerful is really the hyung.  I thought he would be a sports man, but it was interesting to find out he was studying creative literature.  I also felt camaraderie when he kept losing or breaking things.  He seems to be good at writing and is very logical.  I would like to nominate him as potential winner if there were a keyboard battle contest. 

**JIMIN**:  When I first saw BTS, I thought he was the youngest.  He is cute and I really like his eyes.  He appears as the grandson of a rice cake business, and I think he would have fit well even if he really went into that business.  I was suprised he had good acting in the Another Story.  He seems to be the type that does everything well when given the chance.  He was so attractive when he was wanting food, it made me want to buy him a meal.  His reactions are always good, so teasing him seemed most satisfying.  If I could have one of them as a younger brother, I would choose Jimin.

**V**:  I really don't know.  I can't define his character. No, even his mental world is not of this world.  The speech does not go in intro-build up-climax-resolution, but intro-resolution.  Character Deoni Dalbi in a book by Lee Youngdo had this type of speech and I didn't know I would meet such person in real life.  If I were to live with someone like this, life would never be boring.  Of course, life would also never be peaceful but..   When he wrote the lyrics ""glass-mentality boy"", I liked his artistic emotions.

**JUNGKOOK**:  He's the youngest and he really does act like the youngest.  The conversation images seemed to have been made to be especially cute.  Unlike Jimin, I feel like he would be hurt if I tease him so I can't tease him.  Initially, he seemed like a kid who wanted to be mature, but later on I could see a bit of that maturity as the character seemed to grow. His image in the cards at times were so different that sometimes I could not recognize him.  When he's smiling, sometimes he's difficult to distinguish from J-Hope.  He suddenly seems very depndable when he starts singing.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Time travel to 2012 is a bit of a cliche premise.  The fact that we know they become world stars neutralizes the limits of idols in reality.  As the protagonist already knows the future, the player can focus on the details of each step as they naturally reach that point along the way.

Even now, I have each members profile up beside me as I'm working hard on this game.  I've even found an error in the process. V is from Daegu but when he goes to the countryside, he uses Jeolla satoori.  But outside of that I can see that they put in a lot of effort to be consident with many things about BTS.  And it was interesting to play Another Story of what may have happened to the members if they did not become BTS.

The flower that's used to level up the cards is ""smeraldo"" and it's a flower that doesn't exist, created by BigHit to sound like it existed, to be used as hints in BTS world....and many other TMI's have been absorbed into my brain now.  I might have to join ARMY fanclub in order to finish this game. 

&amp;#x200B;

The game OST Heartbeat was a very nice song to listen to.  And the MV cinematography wasn't cringy eighter.  It looked like they put in a lot of effort and looks like a scene from a drama.  The acting by members look natural too.  The talk bubbles were the only part that was a bit difficult to watch.

BTS World exploration has just started for me.  Since I've survived the trials and tribulations of adjusting to the game, I will play this as far as I can.  Next article, you'll be able to see an ajussi manager in his 30's training the BTS.  The fact that it feels like I'm the one being trained rather than BTS...surely is just my imagination.",56,181,False,self,,,,,

When I first joined our research group in 2016, I was the ""eccentric KPop fan"". No one took me seriously, and a lot of people thought it was unprofessional for me to be in my late 20s and still be a huge fan of a ""factory-produced"" KPop boy band. 

Three years later, and it's SO different. When I ask for vacation for a concert, I don't get the snide comments I used to get. Instead, I get ""Oh I saw their SNL performance! They are better than so many American pop artists"", or ""I was reading the lyrics to \_\_\_\_\_\_ , and I was so impressed"". These people are not ARMY and don't listen to KPop in general, but they have this new respect for BTS that just amazes me.

I've been listening to KPop since middle school (2006-ish) and I absolutely love this change in attitudes towards BTS, but was curious to know if anyone else has had a similar experience? I live in Boston, which is a pretty progressive city and has a large student population. Is this not really a thing in the Midwest or southern states?

I'm not sure where else to post this but since it is related to BigHit, hopefully it's allowed here.

I'm about to sign up for the Belift global auditionthe New York City location on July 9th, this Tuesday.
To be frank, I'm on edge. Even if I logically deduce that it's not too big of a deal, each day that passes I keep getting more nervous.
Mind you, I've not done something like an audition ever; not to mention this will be the first time I'm singing directly to someone.

Are there any other guys here going? We should support each other haha. 
Finally, are there any words of encouragement you can share to help calm these nerves? 

Thank you so much!",4,17,False,self,,,,,

I love it on him, so Ive begun to love it on myself too. I think Im less self-conscious about smiling and laughing fully these days.
* **Dimple** made me appreciate my dimples, along with the fact that a lot of the guys have dimples and I think theirs are adorable.
* In terms of mindset I have become more intentional about expressing my feelings and **being more vulnerable**. Ive never been good at that and tend to bottle everything up so no one is bothered with them, or until I reach a breaking point and everything suddenly pours out, not in a constructive way but rather in rage and frustration. Seeing the members being candid with their hopes and fears, whether in interviews or in lyrics, has helped me a lot in this department.
* A lot of family and acquaintances keep asking me about what my goals/plans for the future are, and what I'm going to do next after graduation. It gives me a lot of anxiety, so **""Paradise""** has been reassuring me that it's alright for my dreams to be small at the moment, and to take things one step at a time despite other people's opinions.
* Lastly, a few weeks ago I woke up from a nightmare. I dont know if it was because of lingering anxiety from the nightmare or what, but while I was trying to fall back to sleep, a bunch of embarrassing moments and regrets from my life kept bearing down on me. However, I happened to have re-watched **Namjoons UN speech** the day before, and I was able to calm myself with his quote about how our past-me, who made mistakes, is still me, and that tomorrows me, while perhaps a tiny bit wiser, will also be me. And I was able to go to sleep again. Sometimes we just need to forgive and be kinder to ourselves. Were worth our second chances.

Coming from someone who literally took more than a year of having every individual member take turns (OT7 for life), I just wanted to understand the process that you guys went through. 

When I first discovered Bangtan, I saw Taehyung at the Ellen show. Then I watched their performance on Jimmy Kimmel and confused Tae with Yoongi (lmao). So I was a Yoongi stan. Then I thought Jimin was the one. Then RM. Then Jin. Then Hobi. And it would cycle. I could probably quote every Run BTS and BV episode by memory since Ive watched them multiple times and would focus on whom I thought was the one. 

Whats funny is that it was never JK. Hes my age and I always told myself that I preferred the oldest hyungs more. So I always found myself gravitating towards the rap line. But theyre not kidding when they say that your bias chooses you? 

Like everything in my life, that went wrong. Ive accepted JK as my ultimate bias (its been a long time with him) and the other six as my bias wreckers. 

But in all actuality, itll always be OT7. Honestly this is probably just a call-out post to Jeon Jungkook because how dare he.

How about you? :)",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Altho they aren't so high in quality, when it comes to production, they seem to be simple and to the point. The previous songs aeroplane, don't leave me now and Crystal snow have been my ultimate favorite. I wish they made a music video of Crystal snow. Also the live performance doesn't show the part when Jin hits the triple high note. I'm dying to see it. For him to hit it 'live' is just mind blowing. 

Lights has been my personal fav amongst the other two that were released. The vocals are stunning as usual. Cinematography was equally tremendous. The ratio of line distribution amongst the vocalist is perfectly balanced. The rappers individually got their scenes. Perfect falsettos and a high note. Tae's visuals with that blue hair suits him very well. Tae's vocal transitions in  ""terashite kurerekara osorezu"" is smooth and perfect, keeping in mind he has a deep voice. Jimin's angelic voice when he says ""kikoe teru"" had me looping over and over again. Jhope had an amazing tone and the flow was spot on....

(Reddit is never really mentioned in these tweets) 

I find the concept of ARMY culture having slight differences depending on the platform to be quite fascinating. Especially since were one of the largest and most unified fandoms, these little differences are so interesting to think about. 

Until now, Id always thought about it just as that. Interesting. But now Im starting to believe its a little problematic, and creating more division and hatred towards other ARMYs. Im personally someone who didnt really have any social media to connect to BTS with until getting ARMYs amino. Though it isnt a perfect place, Ill always sort of consider it my home. A place where I met a lot of my current friends and mutuals. A place where I wrote and first found a platform to express myself.

After seeing these tweets about Weverses strange melting pot quality, I noticed that many of them put a negative light on amino ARMYs and Facebook ARMYs. Well, most of them actually found a way to hate on every platform besides twitter. There seems to be a stereotype that amino ARMYs and Facebook ARMYs are the most oblivious ones, who are koreaboos, no jams, or just downright awful. Its not really anything that we can help, that each platform has its own stereotypes. But what bothered me the most was that everyone seemed to put stan tweet on a pedestal, though it obviously has many MANY problems of its own.


The way these tweets talked about their fellow ARMYs was just downright disrespectful and rude. I never knew so much hatred existed among our fandom towards OURSELVES. What happened to ARMY being a... family? What happened to trying to unite ourselves in support of BTS? Why the need to put each other down?


Yeah, some things some people do could be considered cringy. But werent we all there at at least some point? I mean, I think I called someone oopa once *shudders*

I wasnt in that phase for long, but I WAS there at one point. Why cant we all be a little more understanding and empathetic towards one another instead of acting like we all of a sudden come from rival countries? Isnt that what BTS and ARMY has always stood for? Breaking down barriers and boundaries, coming together in spite of diversity?

Of course, problematic behavior exists. But theres no need to generalize an entire platform, or at least talk so disrespectfully about one another. We are all fans after all.


One tweet said these amino and Facebook ARMYs dont get twitter humor. Has it never occurred to anyone that some people have their own preferences? I personally cant really enjoy stan twt humor that much. Its not that I dont get it, I just feel so overwhelmed by its culture. Thats why I find Reddit and tumblr to be such safe havens, and amino to be a good place to connect with the friends I made there. 

When did being an ARMY have to become so political and complex? Sometimes I really think that most of the fandom forgets what this whole thing is about. Enjoying BTS, learning from BTS, supporting BTS, and being a family

This was a really long rant but I felt like I needed to get this all out. On a final note, i wanted to bring up what weve all heard about social media. Would we really say what say to each other online to each other in person? I was recently traveling across Europe and noticed a couple of ARMYs here and there. A hat here, a backpack there, an ARMY bomb tucked into a purse. I cant imagine that someone from stan twt who happened to run into an ARMY irl who was an amino army would actually be so disrespectful towards them. They wouldve had a conversation like any other about BTS. In the end we all enjoy talking about the little things. How we love this song, MV, era, hairstyle...

I already have quite a few tattoos and I've never struggled with ideas before but with this one I really have nothing. As I want to get something centred around mono I want literally anything to do with the songs, lyrics, designs (from the MVs) etc. - I'd rather get an 'image' as such rather than words but I'm open to anything. Here's what I've got so far -

* My favourite track from mono is seoul, my favourite line being ""if love and hate are the same words I love you Seoul / I hate you Seoul"" but I can't think of anything I could get that wouldn't be in relation to..Seoul? If that makes sense? I don't want the tattoo to represent Seoul as a location / place but just the song itself. Though the whole song is obviously about Seoul and there's nothing in the MV I could get image wise as they're video clips of...Seoul
* I could get a moon (for moonchild) but I already have 2 of those and so don't want any more
* forever rain - I'd love to get something for this song and I was thinking of taking an image from the MV but I wouldn't want any of those designs tattooed on me, I'm also not keen on getting things like an umbrella etc. 

I think I'm struggling because like I said I want an actual 'image' rather than words and I'm just so stumped - I've seen so many lovely Joon / mono drawings that people have had tattooed but of course I'd never steal someone else's design / tattoo but I myself cannot draw at all so again I don't really know where to go with it

I know tattoos are obviously a personal thing and so of course I have to decide for myself but I really need some inspiration as nothing feels right so far and I really want to honour the masterpieces that are both Joon &amp; mono :( I hope this post isn't annoying, sorry if it is !!",11,20,False,self,,,,,

I have terrible memory and am trying to piece together a picture of their dorm arrangements based on what I remember seeing from comeback shows, interviews and Run episodes etc.... Here's what I know:

Dorm 1 - Tiny apartment, all 7 sharing one bedroom.    The Bangtan 1st birthday video probably shows you all you need to know.

Dorm 2 - Upgrade to a larger house where rooms are shared between two people (except for Jimin, Hobi and V sharing a room). I'm guessing this is the dorm shown at the start of Bon Voyage 1? Other than that I don't recall seeing other photos or footage.

Dorm 3 in Hannam, Seoul's version of Beverly Hills - Is this still the current dorm?  Apparently they all get their own bedrooms (except Jimin &amp; Hobi who remain happy roomies), but really Jin and Yoongi also share a room, just that they have semi-private areas separated by a shelf. Sin have mentioned pushing their beds together to watch movies which doesn't seem plausible with the current setup, but that threw me off for a long while and made me mix up this dorm and the previous one  Seen in the DNA Comeback Show, BV3 and some Run episodes.

I am a 34 year old woman, and fairly new to BTS fandom.  I started listening to them back in 2018 while I was on maternity leave with my daughter and Ive just gotten more and more into them ever since. I regret not knowing of them sooner because they were just in my city in September. 

I literally listen to them all day every day while Im at work. Their musical style varies from album to album so I find they are perfect to listen to - I never get bored, and their music is A++++. I enjoy watching tons of MVs and fan videos. Love their personalities and everything about them basically. I even have my biases (thats what people call favourites/crushes now, right? Lol) 

Basically everyone I know thinks this is very weird. I struggle with people making me feel (and sometimes myself feeling) like Ive reverted back to being a teenager. I am not Korean and dont understand any Korean (Bless those who translate for subtitles!!) - I am a white married lady and for this reason people seem to think that my love for BTS is almost inappropriate. 

I dont go around advertising to everyone that Im a big fan of BTS, but I have no shame in telling people how amazing they are when they ask me what Im listening to/watching. I have no problems suggesting their music when anyone asks for music recommendations. They are amazing after all! 

Im taking the day off work to go to the movies in August by myself to see Bring the Soul.

My big two are Intro: Never Mind and Dream Glow (which is actually what inspired this post).

As for Dream Glow, it took me a few listens to grow accustomed to Charli XCXs voice, but Jimins vocals kept bringing me back.

For the diaries, if you would prefer the Koya or RJ pleather sticker instead of a Tata one, I will switch it out once you are confirmed to buy (since they are sealed).

I unfortunately don't have the Van casing for the Cooky figure set (it broke when traveling back to the US).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't gotten very far in the game so just I'm translating the things he mentions in Korean into English.  It may be different from how the things are officially translated in the game.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**BTS WORLD EXPERIENCE PART 2:   Debut survivor inside the centrifuge that isolates the powers of fighting against the cringe.**  ( is kind of an ability to fight against the cringe.  It's a commonly used term in Korea. )

&amp;#x200B;

[Original Article](http://m.gameinsight.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=18437)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I held onto my sanity that wanted to just escape with the momentum of the centrifuge.  And then, even feeling the cringe became an enjoyable experience.

&amp;#x200B;

The more I played, the more I felt that BTS World was a ""centrifuge for powers to fight against cringe.""  A centrifuge separates substances by spinning them.  They use the differences in densities to do this.  Those who still enjoy BTS World no doubt have the most dense feelings of a fan, or the greatest powers to fight against the cringe.

&amp;#x200B;

But once you overcame the challenges, the rewards that BTS World gave was special.  It's not common to find a game that stimulates feelings of fans quite so.  Although I don't have feelings of a fan, as a person who is looking into game contents, this was honestly an interesting experience.  This time, it was a manager's desperate survival along with unpredictable growth of the members. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the game, the 5 star card I received was of Taehyung (V).  I got him as my first S level member in Superstar BTS too, what is this fate?  Picking for 4 star cards, I got V again.  I used his photo as my profile.  In this way, he became my bias.  Without intending to.

&amp;#x200B;

The DNA version in title loading became my theme for falling asleep and waking up.  I couldn't help it.  I couldn't play it on the way to and from work, however,  I even played ""Idol Master"" series game in the packed subway to work, but I just couldn't with this game.  I assume that even now, there are many ARMYs who are hiding the screen of their phones as they enjoy this game.

&amp;#x200B;

Like Dragonballs, I collected each member, found them a new dorm, and coerced them to clean, and discussed schedules and even about finding them a teacher as the game story flowed on.  Discussing the lyrics, sometimes Yoongi would get angry.  At times it felt like he's being made to fight for the sake of fighting, but let's gloss over that for the sake of the tension in the story.  In fact, it really was fun.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In this world, BigHit feels like an organization of just one manager-CEO and seven idol-staffs.   All the tasks that you can imagine in an entertainment company have to be done by the manager and the members.

&amp;#x200B;

If this were an adventure boy anime from 1990's, I feel like the CEO will appear after the debut, put on a serene expression, and say ""this was all a training to let you exceed the limits of your potential.""  But hopefully it won't go in that direction after the update.  Please tell me it's not so. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, Jungkook and Jin were doing market research, and Jimin and Namjoon went away for 40 minutes to deal with the receipts.

&amp;#x200B;

Beep -- An urgent schedule appeared.  It always only appear at times like this.  I wanted to cry.  The rewards were too high to ignore.  I ended up pressing the stop on the tasks, and had to get all the members to join.  Should it really take 7 members 40 minutes to organize comeback information for the media?  Organizing information for the media is really not such a big task.  I mean, I don't mean to downplay the hard work of those who work in the marketing sector but.....

&amp;#x200B;

There was another mystery of this world.  Why does a member who doesn't do a schedule never recover his condition?  If he was just practicing on his own, at least his ability should improve.  I wished they would recover a little bit, even with just letting them sleep.  Making them drink 10 coffees to go and work made me feel bad.  I'm so sorry Yoongi, I had no choice.   After you debut and make money, let's go and get your caffeine addiction treated.

&amp;#x200B;

The missions were extreme too.  I mean, organizing a birthday party for a nephew/niece of a TV station PD already seemed like hyper-realism.  But in addition, is it even possible to mess up a birthday party?  What the hell did you do at that birthday party?  And then the next scene game me the answer.  Ah, Namjoon lit the balloon on fire.  If it's Namjoon, we have to be understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To raise idols require so many little tasks, and the game seem to give the moral teaching that in the end, it depends on the ability and perseverance of the manager.  I became desperate User Interface for ways to improve their conditions in a batch or exchange repeat cards as a batch.  So proud of myself, exchanging each card individually, one at a time (he's being sarcastic here).  Please, also for abilities to organize the cards by abilities.  Currently, I have to individually look at each cards for their abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Up to chapter 3,  I thought, ""Debut.  That easy (Bob Ross reference XD)"", and played with enthusiasm, but then I realized it was just using hope as a bait for torture.  Starting the fourth chapter, the cruelty of the entertainment industry started to come out.  A mission would requires eight wings, and I wonder if they should be mailing out wings instead of working as staff for BigHit. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was important to be laid back and play the game slowly.  I did spend money to buy wings  few times initially.  They were expensive.  I'm sure they're made from feathers plucked from a phoenix.  The game is not impossible to play without spending money.  It just takes time.  If you slowly evolve the 4 star cards, the light will eventually come. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The real enemies were from the inside.  The members.  They incessantly tried to challenge my powers to fight against cringe.  They would phone, text and attack me through SNS.

&amp;#x200B;

""I was startled by a handsome man in the practice room, but it was just my reflection in the mirror.""  Jin's crossed the line.   
 I quickly replied, ""the mirror wasn't cleaned properly.""  Let's try to keep a long lasting civil relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Taehyung's expression are not always logical, but when he replied by saying ""I'm going to go touch the clouds with manager"" after being told he'll be put on airplane (a metaphor where  the actual meaning is:  he'll be praised).. I had to sigh and put the phone down.  I'm sure my sanity will fly to the heavens way before I get to touch the clouds.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while, I got used to these and it became not hard to bear at all.  But as soon as I thought I was fine, the upgraded attacks started.  Jimin called.  I didn't know that it would be a video call. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was started by a guy looking like a squid on the screen, but then was startled again realizing that was me being filmed by my own phone camera.   While I was in shock, Jimin said ""Manager-nim. Why aren't you coming?  Don't you wanna see us?""  And Hoseok started to act cute saying ""Please buy us chicken, Ahhhahhng\~\~"" and all the other members started to act cute behind him.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the longest 5 minutes of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost got angry, wondering if it's really necessary to film them act so scary levels of cute, and then tried to think how it would be if they were girl group members. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ah,  they did well filming, I thought.  I can see how much love and effort they put into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It took one week to get to chapter 5, but I was stuck there for a whole week.  Debuting idols is really a hard task.  What am I supposed to do, when I have no empathy and wisdom cards?  As if to dance a twist, I repeated picking, powering up, and evolving until I was somewhat ready.   In future in chapter 6, if I get to succeed in their debut, I'm sure I'l be crying, not from feeling emotional but for all the gems that had to be sacrificed.  Please sell me some gems.  I'll really pay.

&amp;#x200B;

""Another story"" stories were all fun.  They were all new ""what if"" stories and you can see the effort put into each videos and progression of the story.  It made me feel guilty because the protagonist kept doing semi-illegal acts to meet the members.  But since this is a unidirectional story, you just need to self-filter as if you're an invisible man.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm up to chapter 2-3 for all the stories and the best is Taehyung.  Taehyung's friend who somehow is supposed to be the same age but looks like he could have a son as old as Taehyung is a real scene-stealer.  And I'm not saying this just because he's been forced to become my bias.

&amp;#x200B;

While waiting for the schedules, I fiddled with their styling.  This might be fun to just add more outfits and make it into a separate game, like ""I love Nikki (dress up game).""   I took off their too-serious uniforms and put them in casual clothes.  There were some clothes that look like I would probably like when I'm shopping as well.  Because face completes the fashion, they look good no matter what they wear.  Except the bow ties.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are still a lot of things I'm curious about.  I still only have the one 5 star card from the beginning.  If I had more luck with my draws, how different would the play have been?  And that does the picture of the Saturn signify?  Is it foreshadowing that they will surpass BTS world to BTS Universe?  Since there are stories I have not seen yet, the play continues on.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I wrote this with grumbling, it' wasn't all torturous.  It was a new world and later I felt like they were my dongsaengs, and I found fun in watching them and grew fond of them.  Hey kids, I won't forget you even when I stop playing this game.  I'll come back occasionally so please call me.  But not the video call please.

I really enjoy the idea of weverse. Having a opportunity to interact with the boys on a exclusive platform. But it quickly turned in to a competition for the boys attention. Resulting in some less than fortunate posts from users such as un-flattering pictures or memes of BTS.
Today one of the members commented on such a post, saying he doesnt tolerate such behaviour. The post was then quickly removed by the user.

**Were the results surprising to you? Did you change your mind about any hair colors?**

# Next Survivor Series

*There were 62.6% (184 votes) for continuing the hair color series and 37.8% (112 votes) for doing the BTS World OST (4 BTS songs only) before continuing the hair color series. We will continue the hair color series and keep the BTS World OST game for later :)*

We will continue our current survivor series: **Hair Color (Per Member)**

* We will have one game per member.
* Each color includes all shades/styles/highlights of that color.
* We will play the games in order of official fanchant.
* The first round of the **Hair Color: Suga** game will be posted on **Tuesday, July 16th** between **8 - 10 AM PST**.

**HAIR COLOR COMPILATION ALBUM**

I made [a compilation album](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eCZKxHk5G1TUaeBzgYQewWzQ9B0YwWXI) for pictures of hair color per member. It's editable for everyone so feel free to add images if you wish (n.b. you need to be logged in to upload images).

**HAIR COLOR CHART**

'x' indicates that this hair color will be included for that member. Please let me know if you spot any discrepancies :)

I also really love [Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Hbj2_jPd8exyvapu7yq9w) (a Korean reactor who has been mentioned/recommended here before). He's not afraid to show emotions and he seems very real.

Halsey featuring in BWL could really increase their chances with Grammy voters and it was a top 10 hit too.

Whether they release Shadow by the August 30th deadline, or dont put it out until to fall (September/October ish).

Although I still think it is possible that it COULD be dropped in August. Despite some peoples insistence that its impossible because they havent seen the typical signs of an impending release. In my mind, they could easily pull a Beyonce and drop that shit out of no where.

With that said, lets get back to Grammy chances.

PERSONA

PROS

* Impressive album sales in an era where that has become increasingly difficult. Its an old school model and I think a lot of old school voters would appreciate it

* Boy With Luv is on an elite list of Platinum Certified singles for 2019. And one of the only Pop songs. The other one being Sucker by the Jonas Brothers. Plus it features Halsey, a Grammy nominated artist in her own right. I think a really strong case could be made for a Best Pop Duo or Group Performance nomination.

* Their reputation as one of the hottest pop acts around today is at peak buzz. And even if Shadow is released this fall, it could bring attention back to the boys during that crucial voting period.

CONS

* Persona is only an EP. And while solid, not exactly ground breaking.

* Competition is bananas for Pop Vocal Album

SHADOW 

PROS

* It is likely to be a full album with potentially meatier material 

* It could also potentially contain more collaborations with singers, songwriters and producers with a Grammy pedigree.

CONS

* The album itself might not have enough momentum going into the Grammy voting period

OTHER POSSIBILITIES 

BTS WORLD

It could be eligible for several categories under Music for Visual Media 

1) Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media
2) Best Score Soundtrack Album for Visual Media
3) Best Song Written for Visual Media

I think Big Hit should go for it and submit!! I was extremely surprised at how high quality it was.

RM - MONO

I say many strongly advocating that RM submit it. And Im not against the idea at all. Although I would be hard pressed on deciding under which category. Is it Rap? Alternative? Pop? EDM?

Also, as awesome as the mixtape is, RM does not have a reputation as a solo artist in America yet. So, as a fan, I would manage my expectations.

A couple months ago, I posted a couple of the reasons why I love BTS, and I got really beautiful insights from you guys. This post is a continuity of that, but more from the perspective of the Korean music industry. I watched a video today about how KPop groups are treated, and it broke my heart. As an American army, Im extremely blessed that Ill probably never have to worry about facing any of this. Im linking the video: https://youtu.be/URZ1-Pmi9JY

So this got me thinking, BTS hasnt had to face many of these hardships. I mean, theyve had to struggle a lot, but BigHit has granted them relatively many freedoms. They can tweet almost freely, and they can be open about their struggles, such as V and Jins fight, for example. But more importantly, theyve voiced serious and stigmatized issues such as mental illness and suicide, both prominent in Korea. Theyve been critical about the obvious problems in South Korea, and we can see that they havent had to rebel against BigHit to do so. Their personal issues have been depicted in their songs, and even their new official app. Theyre blessed to have the freedom to write their own lyrics and produce their own songs, and as ARMYs, were blessed too. 

Whats the takeaway? We have seen that BTSs openness is what makes them connect to fans, which now consist of an enormous international base. Its heartbreaking how KPop idols are forced to bottle their creativity and originality for relatively meaningless art and corrupt companies. But BTS not only shows their fans, but they also show production companies the power of genuineness, that cant be expressed by the manner in which most companies treat their trainees. BTSs struggle throughout their lives is what resonates with people, not just some catchy tunes and dance. BTS is proof that its time production companies stop treating idols like robots, because our struggle is what makes us beautiful. All of us. Its okay to struggle, and its not a sign of weakness, its a sign of strength. If those greedy, inhumane companies didnt believe that, now they have evidence.",1,3,False,self,,,,,

If you have payed attention to r/Popheads, you might have noticed how we have bi-weekly discography rankings, in which voters enter a Google Form and give a score from 0-10 to each song in the artist's discography... previous artists ranked have been the likes of Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Ariana Grande and many others; and it's not the boys' turn to be ranked!

The process is really simple:

* I would link the original r/Popheads post below, which includes a more detailed explanation of the rules.
* In said post, you would find the link to a Google Form, which would ask you to login using your Google account... this is done in order to prevent sabotage and allow people to edit their scores afterwards if necessary; no personal information would be saved.
* Normal remixe, SoundCloud covers/freestyles and Japanese translated songs aren't included however, tracks from BTS Festa, solo releases and features are included.
* The idea of for people to not just give every song a 9 or a 10, in order to get more realistic scores.
* Although you don't have to answer absolutely everything included, I would ask you to please try to answer as much as possible and to give every song ranked a fair score if you don't know a song, try to look for it in your preferred choice of music service or just skip it, but don't give said song a fake score.

Already uploaded this post but it got deleted &amp; I realized that it came of as rude and was not well thought out,  I fixed it. I want to clarify that the things that I'm about to discuss do not come from a place of malice but concern. During the last 2 years I have noticed that their marketing strategies have turned from absolute genius to slightly illogical &amp; that the way they've been marketing themselves lately has also been affecting their music (in terms of reach and impact in my opinion), but that is something I'll make a thread about later if you guys want to. But pls respond if you can since I want to have a serious discussion about these topics, becausepeople on other platforms just block me if I bring it up or act as if these problems don't exist.

With worse I mean that it has become all over the place not the fact that they are collaborating with other Western artists. I'm talking about the way they are promoting all the different releases of BTS content. With pure genius I meant that the way they promoted their content releases fit the way they marketed. What I mean with worse and illogical is that the way they promote and market these days has not evolved with the size of the group and their releases of content. Rn we are basically just living of the promotions by Armys.

Their marketing strategy was by the use disappearing/the fact that they often got overlooked and the element of surprise combined with the power of Armys to hype that element up more and further the feelings of curiosity of (non-)Armys with small teasers, which made their comebacks feel more explosive and fresh. 

However nowadays that doesn't really work anymore since it feels like they've never left/disappeared and they got way bigger.

Do you think this too? if not what is your opinion ?and if you do think so too how do you think they can improve their promoting and marketing?",34,0,False,self,,,,,

So basically bts is finally coming to my country saudiarabia,i always thought i was gonna die and never be able to see them irl, i was depressed about this fact since they means the world to me and i've been an army since 2015 but now i have an actual chance to see them like they are REAL???? And not some 2D humans i only watch on my computer...what?? i'm very happy and excited  and i dont want this chance to be lost.

im planning on going to the show with my older sister as she will have to drive me there(long distance) &amp; i dont want to go alone tbh, she asked me to show her the group and if they are worth seeing, i'm a student &amp; very broke lol!! so army bombs might be the only thing i'll afford paying for OTL i need her help with the money i know she wont mind but part of me is scared she will refuse so im thinking of getting her into bts so she can look forward going + enjoy the experience with me &amp; hopefully bts can become something we bond over  

Now the thing is my sister isn't very fond of kpop i used to show her kpop groups long long time ago  (NOT BTS) but she was like meh.. so i stopped
She is 28 y.o btw and listen to khalid/ed shareen/ariana the most 

What's the best way to make her see how special BTS are? Like show her exactly why i love them, how beautiful, complex &amp; empowering their songs are, how they are good people &amp; not just another boyband people like cuz they ""cute"" i mean ahem they ARE cute but theres more to them, you know what im saying,she cares about things like this too but im afraid of coming off dramatic talking about it or annoying her by showing too many videos, i want to keep it short and simple so what's the best way?
Any ideas on specific songs or videos that capture bts the best to someone who isnt familiar with them that give good first impression and hopefully make them army? if you guys can help me &amp; give me suggestion i would be very thankful.",28,34,False,self,,,,,

I am a student in South Korea, majoring in computer science right now :)

Then I thought, ""Wait,, I should make a website that would be helpful for all my fellow ARMIES!!"" So, I listed some ideas that would help us to love BTS. It would be very helpful if I could get feedback or new ideas from the reddit community!! I'm happy to build any ideas into actual websites!  


**1)** **BTS manager meeting website** where BTS World managers can come chat and decide the best future for BTS members :)

But some of the things and questions Ive seen got me thinking (and I apologize if this is phrased weirdly or vaguely)... do you think there are any differences between how old and new ARMYs engage with BTS and their content, or in their general attitudes towards BTS/Kpop?

To clarify what I mean.... I tend to place that generational divide somewhere in late 2016/2017, around when BTS really catapulted into the international limelight and also experienced a shift in musical style from HYYH to Wings/LY. (This is just personal opinion tho.) And I feel like ARMYs who saw + lived through that shift have a different perspective than ARMYs coming into the fandom while (and sometimes because) BTS are international superstars. 

That sounds really awful and kind of like Im bashing new ARMYs so I want to clarify that thats not my intention! Im not looking for wank or to stir the pot. I just want to know what generational quirks you all may have seen. Like, some of the things Ive noticed are:

- genuine surprise that BTS truly went from rags to riches, and that they work their butts off to an unimaginable degree, vs older ARMYs who were there when BTS were still sleeping in the same room and have seen BTS put in that effort firsthand. I think this difference really colors how ARMYs engage with BTS; ie seeing them with new respect bc you didnt realize how much they go through vs being intensely protective bc youve seen how much theyve been through 
- attitudes towards BTS being savage but also lame (surprised delight vs long-suffering exasperation)
- newer ARMYs having so much more insight into and intuition about BTS content release schedule/comeback schedule whereas older ARMYs were constantly shook when BigHit dropped anything without warning (in my experience anyway)
- having an initial impression of them being really put together and, like, dignified vs remembering Expensive Girl etc
- ppl who were shaped by cardoorguy vs ppl who werent. I feel like in recent years non-stan twt has primarily gone nuts over Jimin, Taehyung, and Namjoon. 
- new waves of shock and swooning every time BTS releases a slutty banger (Baepsae vs Fake Love vs Dionysus)
- new ARMYs having so much more insight into streaming effectively 
- etc",161,78,False,self,,,,,

Young Forever - April, MOTS: Persona - April

Wings - October, MOTS: Shadow - October

YNWA - February, MOTS: Ego - February

It makes sense since their last date is in the last week of October. During the finale of the Wings tour which was in the December of 2017, they ended up adding DNA to their tracklist, since LY: Her was released in September. Although I think if they did comeback in October it would be too early to add songs from Shadow to the tracklist, which leads me to a whole other thought. IF BTS do comeback in October and don't add songs to their tracklist for the reasons I mentioned, is it possible that MOTS: Shadow has solo tracks on it like Wings did? Either that, or they release Yoongi's intro on Shadow and put 4 solo tracks from the vocal line on Ego (although I feel like that won't happen) I know they're touring again next year and they're obviously not gonna use the same solo tracks again soo yeah.

Welcome to the official closing post for the [2019 #ARMYMustServe](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D764AQCWwAEEtS-.jpg). This past month has been filled with BTS content, feels, and - thanks to our 2019 MustServe participants - fun-filled charity activities! So let's recap!

&amp;nbsp;

**WEEK 1**

As participants signed up throughout the week, the Staff would assign them to one of four Houses: Team Sejin, Team Bang PD, Team Slow Rabbit, or Team Sondeuk. As an ice-breaker, we gave each House a week to design their emblems, colors, and House motto. WE! LOVED! EVERY! SINGLE! ONE! OF! THEM!!! [Here, we share the emblems with you!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/443271893638971392/587794545127850010/emblems.png)

The official MustServe activity for the first week was Freerice.

&amp;nbsp;

**WEEK 2**

For the second week of MustServe, besides raising rice, we put our creativity to work as [we designed postcards for charity](https://i.imgur.com/36pXSq5.jpg)! Together, we were able to write personalized postcards to 16 PostPal kids + their families, Tobby and Cynthia from the More Love Letters project, and many more through both the Nationwide Children and Any Refugee projects.

We truly hope and wish that our postcards can put a smile on the face of our recipients. Here, we leave the links to the above mentioned charities in case some of you might be interested in writing your own postcard for charity:

&gt; [Post Pal kids](https://www.postpals.co.uk/find-pals/) - Send a personalized postcard to a chronically ill child in the UK to brighten up their days!
&gt;
&gt; [More Love Letters](http://www.moreloveletters.com/the-letter-requests) - Share love and encouragement to the monthly-nominated recipients
&gt;
&gt; [Nationwide Children](https://give.nationwidechildrens.org/site/SSurvey?SURVEY_ID=2621&amp;ACTION_REQUIRED=URI_ACTION_USER_REQUESTS) - Send an e-postcard to a sick child
&gt;
&gt; [Any Refugee](https://anyrefugee.org/#postcards) - Write an uplifting postcard to a child refugee

&amp;nbsp;

**WEEK 3**

To mix thing up a bit we introduced a new MustServe activity, BTS BINGO! And, to celebrate Pride Month, we thought it'd be fitting to include *Born This Way* by Lady Gaga, *She Keeps Me Warm* by Mary Lambert, *Q.U.E.E.N.* by Janelle Mone, and *Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy* by Elton John in the mix.

r/bangtan participants that signed up for the ARMY to ARMY postcard exchange began to prepare their penpal's postcard (and, charity-supporting gift) as the official MustServe activity for the week, as well as play Freerice in their free time.

&amp;nbsp;

**WEEK 4**

While the ARMY to ARMY postcard participants sent out their letters and gifts, we played Freerice throughout the week and, on the last day, we held a rice party. During our 5 hours of *meme*ningful fun, we were able to **raise 18,490 grains of rice**!!! Thank you to all who joined us on the voice channel and/or shared your favorite BTS gifs while we raised rice for charity.

Since the 4th week was our last week, we did a final tally which revealed **House Band PD as our 2019 #ARMYMustServe winner with 117,345 points**! We sent a little sumthin' to the House winners, and while small,  know that we are immensely grateful for your participation and dedication of supporting charities on behalf of BTS and the r/bangtan community.

&amp;nbsp;

We'd like to thank all our MustServe participants. We enjoyed hosting every single one of you this month and, together, we managed to raise/do good in these areas:

- **277,940 rice grains** that will go to feed families in need

- **220 Tabs for a Cause** that will go onto fund many different charities

- **194 items donated**

- **25 postcards for charity**

- **17 trees planted** through multiple environmental charities and 7 by our very own u/MasterofConcrete [^read ^her ^story](https://i.imgur.com/aYLFOrf.png)

- **8 in-person volunteer hours**

- **2 acts of kindness** - here, tech. all A2A postcards would be added to the acts of kindness.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Once again, thank you so much to all our participants! Together, we were able to be true adorable (and caring!) representatives of BTS. We hope to see you guys return for next year's MustServe! In the meantime, know that you can still be a force of good, even if it's not MustServe. We encourage all of our participants and the rest of r/bangtan to keep writing postcards, raising rice, or opening tabs in the name of charity!

&amp;nbsp;

With much love and gratefulness, 

The BTS Projects Team

^(**UPDATE**) 2018 r/bangtan Census: Sooo, this last census was MASSIVE compared to our first two and that's why it's taken us a bit longer to post the results. We are working on tying it up! We hope to post the results before this summer ends. Thank you guys for your patience, and we deeply apologize it's taken us so long!

^(**SOON**) Discussing the future direction of birthday projects. The Team would like to discuss some options regarding the birthday projects with you guys. We'll be posting the discussion thread within the next couple of days, please look forward to it. We hope to hear from many of you guys!",5,84,False,self,,,,,

Hope youre all doing well. I apologize in advance for what I know is gonna be a long post.


I finally got a relaxing weekend after a while and Ive missed Bangtan, so Ive just been re-watching old content along with the newer ones. I just rewatched the Bangtan attic video and enjoyed it even more than the first time. 


We say it a lot because its so true, but I cannot believe we have these seven wonderful men who could not be more different from each other, with all different interests and personalities, but who have managed to work together so well while fitting together so perfectly and managing to receive the love of millions of people. Such good boys! Every single one of them.


It made me realise all over again how there will never be another Bangtan for me. I truly know this from my heart. There will never be another group who just feel so perfectly fitted for me, who have all the things I could ask for and more. Its something thats been on my mind for a whilehow they seem to be tailor-made for me. Its the big and often talked about things, like their music,their lyrics, their group dynamics and performances, but its also the small things.


I thought Id share a few things I really appreciate and see if anyone has anything theyd like to share too:


1)	Like I said, it may not be a big deal to some but I really appreciate how their dance practices are filmed. Just straight up from the front, without any fancy camera-work or lighting. It helps me see the full choreo as it is and I just really appreciate it


2)	The number of comebacks they have a year. I know we always mention how much content they release but their actual Korean comebacks are just twice a year, and personally, I find that to be just the right amount


3)	How passionate and determined the boys are about music and making their own. Each and every single one of them. Everyone talks about members of groups having solo debuts and thats great but our boys just seem to be focusing more on growing personally as composers and song producers and releasing songs when they themselves feel ready, not worrying too much about when or how much, and I just really appreciate that love for music as someone who stans them as artists.


4)	How they have always appreciated their culture, right from the beginning, with Satoori rap, Arirang and till now with IDOL,etc. As someone who is also proud of her culture, this is something I feel connected to.


5)	We talk about concept changes for artists, especially in K-pop, and there are drastic changes we see with each comeback. The boys too have seemingly very different concepts for comebacks, but I love love how the OVERALL CONCEPT is just to tell the story of  the boys as they grow up and how each release is a reflection of their growth as people and as artists. Thats why I find their music so relatable and healing no matter the genre or sound.


6)	Festa. I mean, who even thought this up? Like, lets just put a lot of work into filming and recording things that well release for free for our fans. For 2 whole weeks. And seeing the behind the scenes, you can see how much love and hard work they put into it. It just shows such love back to ARMY on their part and I justreally really appreciate it.


7)	With k-pop being so different from what they know, western publications who try to be appreciative of Bangtan often mention them breaking gender norms, and winning over toxic masculinity, but the things they mention are more often due to cultural differences and not something exclusive to Bangtan, like make-up and costumes, and the like. As a fan, what I have observed is the same thing but on a closer level. Like Joon being so happy to have the nickname Hermione, or Hobi putting glitter in his hair to look pretty, or Jungkook making sure to nail every girl group choreo down to the last detail, or them just really appreciating the hell out of other men, like with that instructor they had or Joon calling Pharrell the sexiest man hes ever seen and Jimin calling Shawn mendes handsome. They are just so open and free and I love it.



Honestly I could go on, but Ill stop here. Its these little things which add to all the big things which convince me that I could never find another like them.

This brings me to Jins game Birthday vlive. Jin revealed he took a break from social media(just because they dont post something doesnt mean they cant use social media. How often do you just search/read without making a single post?) because there was overwhelming hate directed at him.

Do they have to outright tell ppl that reading lies, prejudices, all the accusations, the slander, all the hateful things directed at them for it to be real? Isnt that giving the hateful ppl knowledge that they succeeded in hurting them?

There has been a growing trend of army, the very fandom that belongs to BTS, making posts and the ones spreading their own personal speculations as if it were facts on behalf of the boys.

How many times does BTS have to prove that they do see everything? They see the beautiful artwork of army, but they see the hateful artwork that shouldnt be called artwork too. Some rumors do make the news.

I go back to the point: just because they do not see it right at the exact moment, it does not mean they wont see it later.

Can army do better? The fandom is often praised by BTS as their safe and happy place. Many army think of our community as a safe and happy place bc its their escape or somewhere they can let them be themselves. But to some army, its a place with thorns because army do mistreat other army. Theres simply no way to force everyone to get along, but can army to army at least not hurt each other. 

So can Army do better and be that safe and happy place?

Theres so much good that army fandom have done and continues to do. Is it possible to turn that into a positive fan culture for future too?",11,0,False,self,,,,,

It wasnt until the You Never Walk Alone comeback, when my friend sent me the Spring Day MV. For days on end, I couldnt stop listening to Spring Day. Before I ever became ARMY, I started learning Korean just do I could sing that song and understand its lyrics. That naturally led me to listen to more BTS to find similar music. For its role in leading me into the fandom, Spring Day will always have a special place in my heart. 

For people who knew about BTS for a while before becoming ARMY, Im curious what triggered you to look deeper into this group? Was it a song? A performance? A decision to finally learn their names? :)",213,111,False,self,,,,,

I once saw a meme that stated something like ""ARMY be getting ready for a BTS concert like it's a first date."" It's kind of accurate. Or a lot. I have a sweet, hooded plaid shirt but wasn't sure what to wear under it, but  then I had an idea. Take it back to Highschool, or summer camp, or any number of childhood events that involved having a t-shirt signed. I got a huge shirt, it was very loose, and had it signed by ARMY at the concert. I wanted to make a memory with ARMY.

https://i.redd.it/beonkirj7rb31.jpg

The front received less attention, but I think people were shy about signing around the boobage. I understand. The sleeves and back got the most attention. I tried to get pictures of everything that was written [here](https://imgur.com/a/VJz7Wg4) .

&amp;#x200B;

This was a lot of fun to do. I'd approach people to ask them if they wanted to sign, other people would see them signing and come ask to sign. I got a little lax through soundcheck and in the last hourish pre-concert start due to nursing a migraine, but...I'd 100% do it again at another concert!",6,39,False,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kjXBVsbFobyptwUGP7HjRRT7gEl7qtATR9j_w2m3AwQ.jpg,,,,,

Fire (this and Not Today MVs are what got me into BTS)

Save Me (I feel like this may change after I know their discography better)

Tear (such an emotional song, love their live performance of this)

(Keep in mind that everything is up to BTS and this is fun speculation- we will support them in whatever they choose to do!)

Some are a bit more clear-cut, like Yoongi and RM. Yoongi clearly loves to produce music for other artists, and RM has a distinct sound as a rapper. 

Others have discussed their preferences. Tae seems to be interested in photography and art, and perhaps a bit of acting. JHope has always been a dancer and I can see him opening his own dance academy. Jungkook (in my opinion) is a performer through and through, and may just continue with solo releases.

Does anyone else feel the way I do about this?

I dont know why watching TXT and the boys interaction and me seeing BTS plus ARMYs at the concert venue, and TXT watching and admiring not only BTS, but the ARMYs in the stadium truly makes me feel like were all in this together? Is that weird?

Even down to the fact that most ARMYs know where Bang PDnims Well beat you with our rap, dance, and singing skills. comes from when TXT didnt know was super adorable. 

Also how ARMYs were waving at TXT during the boys concert. Also, how we all love and respect not only BTS but the ARMY bomb noonas, producers, managers, and choreographers of Big Hit. How we as fans knew, watching TXT be all shy and nervous about BTS coming in, that our boys would not stand for all that shy crap and make the atmosphere super comfortable.

Just like a family, we dont always agree. Some of us are crazy. Some of us have been ARMYs for a while and arent hysterical anymore. Some of us are new. Some of us are weird (like me ). And there are millions of us all around the world. And we all can get excited and connected and passionate about one thing. BTS.

It all makes me feel like BTS, Big Hits staff and producers, and ARMYs are all one big blended adopted family and TXT and their new, not-already-ARMY fans are the newest adopted members of the fam. (Even though TXT were ARMYs long before they were TXT but ) So precious. We must nurture them

Warning: this is going to be quite long!

So I rewatched Lights a few times this weekend and the more I think about it, the more I think it has an significant place in BU. Im not on Twitter, so Im not sure how many theory posts there have been about this. This is purely my own take; and its complicated so please bear with me!

Premise: lets assume that all the boys are their characters in BU. The two people who have been actively trying to fix things are JK (by letting himself be the lonely suffering child in Omelas in exchange for his hyungs happiness) and Jin (by travelling back in time and actively changing events). 

We see this at the beginning when JK is alone in the theatre, and V is unable to enter. At this point JK still believes that he has to be alone for the others to be happy, which is why V is initially unable to enter the theatre. However, V and Jimin wont let him suffer alone, so they find a way to enter the theatre through the ATM (the Magic Shop?)

Jin, on the other hand, we see standing by himself watching the rest of the hyung line walk by, presumably into the theatre. Time is then frozen while Jin walks by them, and at the end of the chorus we see him take a seat with the rest of the members inside the theatre. For once he doesnt try to change any events even though he is able to.  

This is where it got interesting for me. Jin has always served as a protagonist in BU, and his time travel superpower has always been a central facet of this. But, what if it is not a superpower at all? What if all the members have the ability to manipulate time just as Jin can? This is why we see various members moving while the others are frozen. This is hugely significant because it tells us that we are all equally superheroes. 

So what are the lessons? 

First and foremost, we are all special and have the ability to change our our lives. But instead of focusing on our past mistakes (what Jin tried to do for so long), we should focus on the present and how we can (and help each other) move forward. 

You truly never walk alone. In the middle of the video JK still feels like he should be alone and tries to leave. (Jhope passing by a frozen JK in the lobby, reanimated JK then walks towards the exit while the others are frozen) But he is stopped by V who freezes time to stop him from leaving and takes him back inside the theatre. We all support each other. Also goes back also to my first point of using our power to help each other move through the present.

You can build your own family who will love and support you for who you are - Jimin appearing and the ensuing maknae line love pile. In BU, JK, V, and Jimin are all extremely lonely boys, but here they are able to find and connect with each other. 

Rap line provides resolutions for their characters and also suggestions on how to love and forgive yourself.

J-hope has always carried a burden of sadness that he was abandoned by his mother, and he has always tried to hide it (the snickers coming through the door in Fake Love). Here he shows us that it is ok to feel and show that you are sad, and to take a break when you need to (leaving the theatre and go to the lobby) as long as you dont give up. 

Suga has always carried a burden of anger, and of all the members, the one with the highest emotional wall. Here he shows us it is ok to trust the people who you love and love you, be vulnerable and rest (him watching the others sleep, and laying down to sleep himself at the end).

RM has always carried a burden of blame. He blames himself for not being able to be there for his members when they needed him (not answering Taehyungs phone call). Here he shows us that is ok to make mistakes and not constantly feel like you have to fix things for other people (let the popcorn fall as it may, in this case). 

If we can do all this, we can really truly love ourselves, and everything we do will be a story for the future (just like a movie), one that we can watch back fondly and hopefully share with the people we love. 

Ok thats it from me, whew! Would love to hear what you guys think.",8,43,False,self,,,,,

1102,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2019-7-25,2019,7,25,2,chb27f,self.bangtan,Map of the Soul Persona and parallels to Theater + Shadow Ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/chb27f/map_of_the_soul_persona_and_parallels_to_theater/,FictionLoverA,1563988678,"Recently , I noticed that Boy with Luv and the general concept of Map of The Soul Persona reminded me of theater and acting. Not the concept of the message (although it does correlate) but the aesthetics of both the MV and the concept photos , as well as the Persona theme and other references. First we had the Boy with Luv MV , which seemed to me (and I think it was done deliberately ) to be emulating a broadway musical , with settings and choreography similar to broadway productions as well as the references to ""Singing in the Rain"" ! 

Then came the concept photos which gave me an acting-actor vibe. The 1st version with the selfies and the photos with different expressions and moods , the 2nd version with the retro borderline voyeuristic vibe of seeing them getting ready for something , the 3rd version with them posing in a seemingly bright and proper background with stiff poses and expressions , and finally the 4th version with them dressed in over the top clothing depicting glamour and indulgence and full of Dionysus references. 

And finally , we had the Persona archetype which according to Jung is the masks/roles that we take on every time we interact with other people which change according to the people or situations we are in. It's a neutral phenomenon that just is and it's not inherently negative. Acting to adapt and to accomodate others is everyday life and not something negative. People do not behave the same in any situation and to all the people they interact with. We all behave accordingly and that's what the Persona is. It is a social mask / role that is not necessarily who we truly are , nor is it the opposite of who we truly are. Each Persona is somewhat tied to the person or people it is received by. For example , The Teacher is a role the person who teaches takes on when in front of their students. It's not necessarily who they are as people and it might not necessarily be something they are not either. Of course , a teacher will not reveal everything about themselves as people in front of their students. They might behave differently in front of the students than in front of their parents , their friends or their lovers. It's because they have to keep their behavior and interactions appropriate to who they interact with. It's , in my opinion , really close to the nature of theater because it's like an actor taking on a role and behaving - acting in a certain way , to accomodate the audience. A role they take to entertain the crowd .

All the above made me think more deeply about the concept of this album. The members said that this album was a gift to the fans .Most of the songs could be interpreted to be for ARMYs or are blatantly for ARMYs. And BTS said that when looking at their Persona , ARMYs are the first to come to mind. Much like their Persona itself is connected to ARMYs first and foremost. According to my interpretation , through this album , BTS expressed their Persona . In other words , the role they take on when confronting ARMYs. The role of an Idol , a guide , a role-model , a comfort , a bright caring piece of light that love and appreciate their fans. And that's exactly what they want to project to their audience. And that persona is true and a real part of themselves but it's also not the only thing they are. It's not all they are. It's but one role they take on when addressing and facing their fans. Like all people , they take on different roles according to who they face. They may behave differently in front of their parents and differently in front of their friends. That doesn't mean any of those behaviours is false or truer than the others. People are multi-faceted beings and their face as BTS and as individual members of BTS is but one facet. That's what I interpret their Persona to be.

And having such a persona has its downsides. Having multiple personae in general has its downsides. You can be pressured to behave a certain way in front of certain people , especially when you are in the spotlight much like an actor has to play his part perfectly when under the spotlight and in front of the audience . The audience might be looking at your every move carefully. You can't slip up . You have to be ready and get in the role-put on a mask immediately when faced with certain people and situations much like an actor has to be in their costume and have their hair and make-up ready when they appear on stage. People might actually associate a person with the persona they show in front of them and as such ignore anything outside that , putting that person in a metaphorical box and not seeing anything outside it , much like the crowd only sees the role and not the actor beneath it or sometimes associate an actor with their role . But there is also such a beauty to the Persona. Putting on a mask might make someone feel more secure and comfortable in their interactions with others and help them get along with the people around them or adapt to situations successfully. Such thing can bring joy and comfort to that person quite like how a successful performance that pleased the audience and satisfied the actor can make the actor experience a lot of joy!!! All the concept photos inspired me to make the above comparisons between life with a Persona and acting-theater and I was actually impressed with how multi-dimensional a media like photographs can be in reference to a wider narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

In general , I chose ( or BigHit and BTS drove me) to draw such comparisons between the persona archetype and theater. They presented a gift to their fans while also presenting their Persona as BTS and drawing parallels with the glamorous , bright world of broadway musicals. That is the definition of the Persona archetype in my opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

But , behind the Persona there is so much more. According to Jung , the Shadow is the aspects of one's self that a person has rejected and repressed , the aspects they don't want to recognize or acknowledge because they are unacceptable not only to society, but also to one's own personal morals and values. Repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. But they too are parts of the self and have to be acknowledged and intregrated to ones' psyche in order for them to reach self-actualization and feel complete. Drawing a parallel with theater again ,behind the glamorous stage and glory of theater and behind the marvelous productions and roles the audience perceive , there is the backstage , there is exhaustion , there is difficulties , there is labor , money , greed , ambition , competition , corruption . 

&amp;#x200B;

Dionysus himself was such a complicated and dual deity and his existence was to his followers and worshipers a facilitator of embracing the Shadow and reaching self-actualization . He was the patron god of theater , god of the vine , wine , fertility , ritual madness and religious ecstasy. His followers and worshipers started the first ever form of theater , first form of theatrical performance in Ancient Greek during their meetings/festivals. But it was all done during moments of extreme intoxication and mad religious ecstasy. He was called  **Eleutherios** (""the liberator""), his wine, music and ecstatic dance freed his followers from self-consciousness, fear and care, and subverted the oppressive restraints of society. During those festivals , in their delirious state , his followers and worshipers were described to become possessed and empowered and through their mad frenzy reach joy and thus ease their suffering. He was often portrayed as the god who crossed the boundary between the civilized and uncivilized and the known and unknown. He was represented as a god of chaos and the protector of misfits. 

&amp;#x200B;

The song Dionysus is so representative of the nature of the god Dionysus and his impact to his followers so if they used that as a transition to ""Shadow"" , an album about acknowledging the repressed and unwanted , darker aspects of one's self and accepting them , then that would be one of the most brilliant narratives of all time for a trilogy of concept albums. Especially if they kept a parallel comparison to theater and utilized another form of theater to present it like they did with Persona and broadway . Maybe an operatic style of theater or cabaret style. If the collaboration with Buz Luhrmann was for something like that , it would be amazing because he has as style that could do such a concept justice and has experience. A theatrical style and parallel for this whole trilogy ( if it's a trilogy) would be pretty refreshing and the ""Lights"" MV had references to theater as a theme as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways , sorry for rumbling on and on but I just had to put my thoughts into writing and share it with you! What do you think?! Am I reaching too far ? How did you interpret the themes yourself ? Any critisism for my theory?! How do you think they might continue the narrative?",24,50,False,self,,,,,

Last week I asked you guys to help me rank BTS's discography and now i'm back to show you the results...

But before that, here is some of the things you might need to know:

* **RECORD NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS!** Thank you so much for helping me...
* Were the scores inflated? probably, but not as bad as some antis expected... I still believe most of the results are fair.
* When it comes to [my rankings](https://www.reddit.com/user/radiofan15/comments/c19amj/rpopheads_discography_rankings_so_far/) (from which BTS is the 16th artist ranked so far), BTS got a couple of records, tied an existing record with Paramore and fell short on some of the most prestigious ones jus behind the likes of Mariah Carey and Charli XCX among others.
* People really don't care for Nicki Minaj here... but to be fair, the Queen has been facing the haters through her whole ''carea'' and she's used to it.
* It's was too late for us to rank *Seoul Town Road* but I still managed to include it somewhere in the ranking.
* In r/Popheads, we have a term called ''*to Slumber Party*'', a reference to the 2016 Britney Spears song of the same name... the term comes from a Rate that pitted Britney's 2016 album Glory against some more heavily acclaimed and successful 2016 pop albums like Beyonc's Lemonade, Lady Gaga's Joanne and Rinanna's ANTI... in that time [this were the songs left](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292042312958083075/586869846386409472/unknown.png) in the Top 10 and Slumber Party won against all of them due to being a popular and uncontroversial choice that might not be everyone's top pick but it's really high among everyone's picks.
* Also *Trivia : Just Dance* deserved better!

What is the actual difference between the ""Bring the Soul Movie"", which is coming to the cinemas soon, the ""BTS World Tour Love Yourself Europe Movie"", which you can just recently stream at Apple TV/Amazonprime, and the ""BTS World Tour Love Yourself Europe DVD Box"", which came out earlier this year ?

It seems to me, that they are all pretty much covering the same footage?

I learned how to be more present, more in the moment, and grateful for everything. After feeling the rumbling of basses below my feet as Suga &amp; J-Hope were on the big screen and the view of all the globes going crazy to ""Idol"" it really showed me how to be appreciative of the moment.   


If you're interested in this mindset or even watching the video! Feel free to click on the link to the video.  


I'm currently homeless (staying at friends houses')  and just moved to LA to pursue dance, youtube, &amp; videography. It'd really help if you could share this, or even help me spread the word to twitter!   


Hope you guys enjoy it (:

But when I watched the vlives sonething felt off. They do so much on camera. They even share things like Jung-kook fainting on one burn the stage episode.

This trait hits really close to home because my father is the same exact way. Which got me thinking.... Yoongi is one of the quieter members. He often times just spends his time in the back, fondly watching his dongsaengs. He doesn't love the camera, but knows it is part of his occupation. But, there are things that are aside from his flourishing talent and good looks that I have grown fond of with Yoongi through glimpses of what he says or does in the back. 

So, I thought I would write this list down and see if you guys have your own Small But Certain Reasons to Love \[INSERT MEMBER HERE\]. Yep. Here we go! 

*Small But Certain Reasons to Love Min Yoongi:*

1. He takes care of his members quietly, pretending to be aloof
2. There's a meme of Yoongi being ""in love"" with their trophies, but you can see that it's him making sure to get a good look at each trophy so that he remains present and grateful for each and every award. 
3. He makes jokes very softly in the back in group interviews and he is often unmic'd and only the members closest to him will hear and they laugh so freely with him
4. He is super brazen in performances, but he is so shy and even straight up too lazy to do some of the things asked of him 
5. He listens to music, especially his own, mostly still, as if his whole world will crumble if he does not listen carefully
6. He has a soft heart and is super down to love cute small things even while pretending to be hardcore
7. He is a homebody who would rather be inside than out 
8. He has very clear and concise boundaries with what he does or does not share and he is firm in his conviction with these things
9. He likes to go fishing with Seokjin and covers himself head to toe to stay milky white
10. He had rough formative years but made his way to become the man we know and love today",86,221,False,self,,,,,

Fansign Hyyh blue: $180 (missing RM sign as he had broken his arm)


V signed soccer ball from KWFF: $105


Fansign suga hello kitty doll: unfortunately i do not know which fansign it is from but it's from around ~2013 or early 2014 and the ink has faded some since it is a fairly old item. I had bought it from someone who owned other signed items in their collection. I can accept $105 for it to whoever is interested. 


FC BTS lights set: $125 includes all 7 pc and all sealed albums including fanclub exclusive album

Skool Luv affair special addition x2: the one on the left is slightly worse condition outerbox, but both have perfect condition photobook/inside content/photocard. I have both Jin and Suga photocards. Accepting highest offer. 



All prices include tracked shipping. USA buyers only, PM to buy. If you are international buyer, you can still message me but note that the price will be higher due to fees and higher shipping cost (~$30+ for 7-10 business day tracked shipping) and I will prioritize USA buyers first due to convienence and no customs restrictions. No holds without a deposit



I have answered multiple times where I get my albums, you can check my comment history. 


I do alot of signature checking before listing the albums for sale.

As someone who has been suffering with depression and anxiety for many years, I cannot describe how horrified I've been feeling. It's like my heart is constantly being squized and pushed out. This stress physically hurts.
I've tried breathing exercises, yoga, music to ""help calm down/relax"" and many others things, but nothing works. Nothing besides Heartbeat from BTS. I've been listening to this song on repeat to manage to breath and calm. Even not knowing Korean, this song has been my salvation. Everything about it transmits something to my mind and body. FOR ME, it's like I'm walking a path and this is just an obstacle I'm going to pass. Like there is peace and freedom and I just need to look for it. I need to look and keep looking and the universe is working with me. Like I'm not alone. Like there are thousands of people hearing and feeling the same, all of us finding peace in this melody together. All of us fighting something in parallel and this song was meant for us to listen. Like an anthem to rise from the darkness we find ourselves in. This song, for me, is hope.
I will look for professional help regarding my mental health but I just really wanted to share how important their music is to me. I've been an ARMY since early 2017 and I can promise you that they saved my life.

When we first learned about their 3 month hiatus my instant reaction was to panic because it felt like they were going to vanish off the face of the Earth for 3 months which was going to be such a drastic &amp; difficult change since they've been present and working for 6 years straight and we've never really experienced otherwise. However, upon them actually starting the hiatus...nothing's changed. Like literally, nothing feels any different. We're all still here, they're all still here, we're all still talking and loving and supporting them...it doesn't even feel like they're on a break.

It got me thinking about when Jin (and possibly Yoongi) enlist next year, I think in my head I'm slowly (dreadfully) counting down the days because I almost feel like once they enlist, all of this will start to be over and it'll never go back to the way it was. But actually, that's never going to happen, is it? This is never going away. We're never going away. We'll still be here and they'll still be here and everything will be fine, in the nicest way possible I'm sure it won't even feel like one of them is missing, you know? Nothing will change. We'll still be talking and supporting and tweeting and so will they. Everything will stay the same, this doesn't have to change. Everything will be just like it is now.

It was just a nice thought and it made me feel a little better about things so, I hope it does the same for you. Also, thanks to you guys for always being here, I know we've all made a promise to each other to always be here for them, just like Bangtan have to us.

I was thinking about other pairs and I'm genuinely struggling trying to come up with two members who don't seem to have an awesome friendship. 

What are you favorite friendships within the group? Why? What members are least close to each other from your perspective? 

I've always liked the more unlikely friendships within the group. Namjoon and Yoongi definitely go into that category for me (see the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/civ8ja/your_favorite_yoongi_and_joon_moments/) I mentioned earlier). Same goes for Yoongi and Taehyung. I don't think they connected right from the start, but they've gotten so close over recent years (or so it seems). To me, looking at their personalities, it makes sense they didn't immediately get along and in that same way it makes sense they get along well these days. Their personalities definitely needed time and effort to connect. And then there's Jimin and Taehyung who don't fall into the unlikely category, but to me are the true definition of soulmates. I think all 7 of them were destined to be meet in some way and the friendship within the group is very special, but Jimin and Taehyung were definitely meant to be cross paths, one way or another. Another favorite for me is Jungkook and Namjoon. Jungkook looks up to Namjoon so much, even now and I really enjoy seeing them together. Namjoon always seems so proud of him.

In general, I really admire how they all seem to be great friends. They've all said it before and I think they're right when they say all 7 of them are very different. But they all clearly put a lot of effort into getting along and they seem to respect each other so much. I often think of BV2 when they were on the boat and Yoongi mentioned he hopes the 7 of them are still together 30 years from now, whether they're making music together or not. A truly special group, I think.",123,105,False,self,,,,,

I love how they always surprise us so I'm never unhappy, but there's of course a 'man would it be AWESOME if they did this!' list in my head. 

For me, I'd love them to go full modern gothic princes (and then wear it to award shows), kinda like in the style of JK's BBMAs jacket, or RM's amazing black dress/robe at that award show last year. Or perhaps lean into the tousled hair-Byron-esque boys of Muster Dimple/Pied Piper (Queue them looking dramatic on the rocky beach! In dark forests!) I have a suspicion TxT and their TU is going to have a heavy Fairy Tale spin as it develops so perhaps that won't be a direction for BTS, but I'd still love it. They're so expressive and great at emotions and just the right amount of melodrama, some artistic brooding would be so much fun.  

What about you, what concepts or costumes/outfits are on your 'that would be nifty' list? More specifically, do you have pictures in your head of how they might present for the new album? What red carpet styles do you dream of? This includes hair colors, styles (Team JK Long Hair forever), specific designers or collections, movie styles/MV concepts, etc.

I was re-listening to MOTS Persona with a friend recently, and she had an interesting observation: the whole album seems to have a dark undertone. At first, I disagreed - but after going back and reading all the lyrics and re-listening to the melodies paired with certain lines, I completely agree with her. I know a lot of people think that Part 2 (which we are all convinced will be Shadow) is going to be a darker album, but I think it's going to be a lot more of this two-tone message - hearing it as one interpretation and reading between the lines for a second interpretation.

My question for discussion is: **in what ways do you think Persona set the stage for Part 2/Shadow, and what are some examples?**

Throughout the entire Persona album, BTS plays with the contrasts between light and darkness. They don't keep it to the typical ""light"" = good and ""dark""= bad; rather, they acknowledge the good and bad of both, and the way that darkness exists because of light (and vice versa). Even standing in the light, with everything good that has happened to them, they cast a shadow. But this shadow may not be something to fear, and they are slowly coming to terms with this idea.

Going through the songs:

**1. Intro: Persona** \- a boisterous, hard hitting song that blatantly asks the difficult question of ""who am I?"". This song kind of maps out the whole MOTS trilogy, because RM talks about how he has multiple sides but they all combine to form him.

""I'm still not so sure if I'm a dog or a pig or what else, but then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me""

""But as it goes on there's so much blabbering, one says 'run' another says 'stop'""

""My shadow, I wrote and called it 'hesitation'...it keeps appearing under the stage or the light""

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Boy With Luv** \- candy pop at its sweetest. However, this line suggests that light isn't necessarily safe and good; it exists and we can find our place under it, but flying too close is dangerous.

""With the wings of Icarus you gave me, not towards the sun but towards you, let me fly""

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Mikrokosmos** \- sweet and thoughtful, like flying through a galaxy of stars. A galaxy is both light and darkness; BTS is saying that we are neitherlight nor dark, but something existing within both that is just as beautiful. The melody soars high during the chorus and returns to cruising altitude in the verses. 

""Perhaps the reason this night looks so beautiful, is not because of these stars or lights, but us""

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Make It Right** \- thoughtful and steady. To me, this line acknowledges that morning ends the night, but it's an endless cycle where we experience both night and day continuously. The melody and beat of the song are simple, but with their voices and lyrics it becomes something more complex. 

""This eternal night with no end in sight, it's you who gifted me the morning""

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Home** \- thoughtful, with a hint of doubt. BTS is acknowledging the shadows and darker/less glamorous parts of their lives, and saying that we as ARMY exist in both spaces. Having the lights off makes things look different, but it's not a bad feeling. The music is 90s R&amp;B hip-hop with a hint of modern pop and faster beats at times (especially some of the rap parts)

""My feet look strange in the entrance with lights off...in this fabulous space I feel completely shabby""

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Jamais Vu** \- yearning/longing, a hint of desperation. The melody does an interesting change of key when it heads into the chorus, enhancing the ""please help me"" message

""I always try to run away, But, you know, my shadow grows but my life and yours are an equal sign, so my remedy is your remedy""

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Dionysus** \- desperation, a speeding train with no brakes. It comes across as a party-rock anthem full of confidence (and this is reflected in their elaborate performance and stage) but under the rock melody we hear Jin's screaming (lol). 

""Art is alcohol, too""

""Until the sun comes up where the party at, until we fall asleep where the party at""

""Drink it up (the pain of creation)""",0,3,False,self,,,,,

I have inquired thru Weply support via app and E-mail but received same vague response. It says that I can change it later, should I assume that they will provide another announcement regarding modification of details? But since according to their FAQ, if we paid thru Paypal, there is no option to modify the address but instead cancel it. I have bought my membership so I can no longer make a refund. The only way that my membership will be delivered to me successfully is to contact my local courier once the kit is already in my country.

I believe and I heard stories of fans (not only of BTS, other fandoms even beyond K-pop) streaming their music on platforms and watching their videos on loop so their favourite artist or artists gain more views/streams (even without listening or actually watching). For me this is very, very sad, since it ends up being a competition rather than enjoying and connecting with the music, the lyrics and, in the case of video content, the visuals aspects. I do not say it is bad or not, but in my honest opinion, is not the music, the art in the end, what really matters? All this streaming thing makes it seem like it doesn't matter whether you are someone who can connect and convey feelings and emotions as an artist, to me achievements seem to be more important and that is not what music is about from my point of view.

Nowadays, it is somehow better if you have gathered a bunch of views in a music video rather than actually seeing the value beyond that, the value in the what the musician wants to tell us and the process behind all of that.

I'm very sorry if I offended anyone, but this is how I feel about this kind of ""controversial"" topic. Also, I know that BTS is being valued by its music itself, not just by its views or streams. They have proved it with their love yourself campaign and their introspective lyrics about oneself and by actually connecting with may people around the world.",49,0,False,self,,,,,

First, a reminder that BTS has helped raise over $2 for UNICEF and helped save over 340,000 children in Yemen from starvation.

Saudi Arabia-led coalition airstrikes in Yemen have killed over 6,000 civilians and the coalitions restrictions on imports have worsened what the UN has called the worlds largest humanitarian catastrophe.

Here is a [Press release from Saudi Arabia General Entertainment Authority](https://www.gea.gov.sa/2019/07/bts/) announcing BTS' concert as part of **Riyadh Season festival**

This is a [Press release from the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage about Saudi Seasons](https://scth.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/News/MainNews/Pages/a-m-1-27-2-19.aspx), a series of festivals and an initiative from MBS. **Jeddah Season and Riyadh Season festivals are part of this year long event.**
&gt;""The Saudi Seasons 2019 initiative is a result of efforts of several government departments that worked since mid-2018 to launch the initiative under the leadership of a higher committee chaired by HRH Prince Muhammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud  the Crown Prince.""

Jeddah Season was the music festival where Super Junior and Stray Kids performed and which Human Rights Foundation urged Liam Payne and Nicki Minaj not to attend.
&gt;""The Jeddah World Fest is funded and authorized by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), one of the worlds worst human rights violators.""

BTS' concert is being described as 'independent' because there are no other musical acts performing on the same day of the festival and, just as for all other dates of the Speak Yourself tour, there are no opening acts either.

In the other post many didn't understand what is wrong with ARMY enjoying a concert in Saudi Arabia. This [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver segment](https://youtu.be/ViDPIyiszoo?t=415) about the US' recent relationship with SA explains the motives behind these entertainment and business initiatives from MBS.

BTS performing in Saudi Arabia contradicts their past humanitarian efforts and their messages of support for minorities and personal freedoms. As an immigrant, black bisexual woman I have so far been proud to call them my favorite artists, so I really hope they will reconsider this decision.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

Today another friend of mine is leaving the fandom because she found it toxic and overwhelming; this year the boys let her down with the music but the reason was that: army.

There is a lot of people that I see leaving the fandom day after day, calling us toxic and full of negativity. Ok, you cant deny the truth behind these statements, but, why you need to leave the group because of that? You can follow just update/translators accounts, listen to their music or watching the vlives.

I guess that people need to belong to the family but once you are in and healed you dont need anymore? 

Its quite true that you found BTS when you needed them the most, you spent your firsts months (even years) loving them and suddenly you are healed/happy and you dont need them, so you excuse yourself with the army is toxic card. 

I know we are quite toxic, I talked about it, I also found some problems and things that I dont like but if you are really a fan, why you just blame the army? I think is a poor excuse.

I love their upbeat, emotional music; the charming good looking boys; THE MEMES LMAOO. But I dislike some (not all) of their fans. Some of them are so borderline obsessed to the point where when someone has an opinion about their bias or even the whole group its suddenly WW3. 

When a picture was posted with Jungkook, Yugyeom and other members of 97 Army was so quick to attack Yugyeom for not meeting the slim, small face stereotype for korean boy groups. It actually bothered me. Yugyeom literally got attacked by Army because he wasnt as good looking as the other boys.

Army is just so toxic in my opinion. I dont want to associate myself with them. Instead ill be a navy. 

But im wondering if some people feel the same way as I do. I just want your opinion.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

Now this might sound weird but my favourite genre is rock and yet I've come here to give BTS a chance. Since my gf says that there are some songs that sort of sound rock-ish i've come here with one question only. Which songs of BTS are the songs that have more of an upbeat sound and are more rock-ish?(boy with luv was the first song I heard and I kinda liked it) I'd ask my gf but she's on holiday so we have no contact for a week. 
(do note that i acknowledge BTS isn't rock at all but I just hope I can make my girlfriend happy with liking some songs)
