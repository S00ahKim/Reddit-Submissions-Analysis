We've included a TL;DR at the bottom.)

&amp;nbsp;

Hello r/bangtan! The weekend is, sadly, over and we're back to school/work :( But it's okay because today is not the Monday we give up, NO, NOT TODAY. TODAY WE...get another cup of coffee (or tea) to help us power through the rest of the day.

We've been pretty quiet on our end with school and work, but we wanted to take the time to discuss some future project ideas with you guys. We want to hear your opinions to determine the course of the future projects and how we will go about organizing these. So please, give us your honest opinions. If you think something might not work or doing it another way might be more efficient, please let us know! We value your ideas!

----

Before we start, though, we would like to make a call to future volunteers and coordinators. If you want to help out with projects, please shoot us a PM! If you have any general comments or ideas, please also let us know, in the comments below (or in a PM).

We're also looking for someone who lives in Korea who is willing to forward parcels to BH. The Projects team will reimburse you for any associated costs (e.g. shipping and handling).

-----

Alright, let's begin! Below, we will discuss ideas for the upcoming anniversary and, the organization of birthday projects, and a Secret Santa!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Upcoming Anniversary**

BTS has grown **A LOT**, almost exponentially, this past year and we want to do something to congratulate them on their success and their hard-work paying off. However, since like half of our coordinating team are students and the other half are full-fledged adults, we will be busy with finals, *possible* summer internships, and work for the next 2 months. Still, we don't want to pass up this anniversary. We want to give you guys the opportunity to congratulate BTS on their amazing growth, send letters and/or fan art to the boys; so, we've been talking about doing a relatively simple project that has a theme or unifying factor.

We've been thinking about doing an acrostic ""poem"", so that the first letter of every message comes together to make one big message. For example, if three people signed up, the message would be something like BTS and the first person would write a message starting with B, the next person would write a message starting with T and the last person writes a message with S. For example:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **B**oldly chasing your dreams, you inspire me so much. 
&gt;
&gt; **T**hese 7 Korean boys are amazing. 
&gt;
&gt; **S**omething I really love about BTS is the music. 

&amp;nbsp;

The above is only an example of a short and simple acrostic poem; your own message can be as long or short as you like (within page limits). The only requirement is that you start your message with your assigned letter - for example, if your assigned letter is 'W', your fan letter should start with a ""W"". Artists are also welcome to participate, as long as they include the assigned letter prominently some way in the artwork!

Obviously, we would like to have a nice and long group message, hopefully at least 100 characters long (so at least 100 participants!).

Would you guys like to do this? Thoughts or suggestions? Reply to our **4th Anniversary** suggestions comment below. Please note that as the anniversary is fairly soon, the deadline we have is the end of May, so any project would have to be completed in that time span.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Future Birthday Projects**

Also in the line of ""*we're students short on time*"", we would like to talk to you guys about coordinating and organizing future birthday projects. As you know, the boys have really close birthdays, more specifically JK^(1 Sept) + RM^(12 Sept) and then Jin^(4 Dec) + V^(30 Dec). Jimin^(13 Oct) is also in the middle. Coincidentally, those are also the months when we go back to school and when we take finals. So, to make things easier for us, we thought about opening the projects two months in advance and close them as their respective deadline approaches.

To give you guys an idea, let's use JK + RM for example. Their birthdays are both in the first weeks of September, so then we would open both projects in early-mid June (date tbd). You guys would be able to send in letters and fan art for both birthdays as you wish during the two months or so the project is open, any time before the project closes. We will close the project strictly on the stated date - deadline extensions were getting too complicated to manage. We will post a reminder post 1 week before deadline instead. The closing deadlines are to be determined, but are likely to be 3 weeks before the actual birthday. This arrangement will allow us to manage projects better and give everyone enough time to manage their submissions.

What do you guys think about this arrangement? We think it will save us time, as we won't have to close a project early 'cause *quick! now we have to open the following project* aaand it will give you guys ample time to submit stuff at your own pace. Give us your thoughts and feedback by replying to our comment **Birthday Projects** down below.

&amp;nbsp;

One last thing pertaining to birthday projects before we changes subjects to talk about the Secret Santa project, presents. Last year we had a little discussion about ideas for anniversary gifts and individual member birthday presents, and a lot of you guys suggested either community or charity work. Which is great! And, it works out perfectly for us since we are a relatively small (but growing) community that's spread out around the world. This allows us to organize a present without the complications of shipping and organizing gifts from the other side of the world. The solar lanterns and KAPS were immensely successful, more than we could have ever imagined, and didn't it feel great knowing that together we made the world a little bit better? So, if it's okay with you guys, we'd like to keep doing charity and other community-centric gifts. 

Any and all suggestions for future birthday gifts can be left under our **Gift Suggestions** comment. It's okay if your idea is not a charity idea, as it might spark an idea for someone else. We want to brainstorm first without ruling out any ideas. So go ahead, pitch in your ideas!

Ok, now we're gonna hand the mic' over to Erin. She will be the main coordinator for the Secret Santa project, so we'll let her introduce y'all to it.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Secret Santa**

Erin here, better known as Erinzilla83. I started thinking about how I don't often buy frivolous things like perfume, video games, or kpop merch, because I can rarely justify spending money on myself for things that aren't necessities. If you're like me, then we tend to save stuff like that as wishlist items for Christmas and the holiday season.

Of course, then you have to worry if Aunt Edna is going to know the difference between BTS and B.O.B., or if you'll end up with a shirt that says Bieber on the back instead of Jungkook.  Wouldn't it be great if you could get merch from someone who won't ask you why you like that Chinese music and understands that sometimes you need 3 photocards of Kim Namjoon? Well, look no further my friends, because I have just the thing! A Secret Santa project for the sub!!

How is that going to work, you ask? Well, we will start off with posting up a survey form so we can get a rough estimate of how many people we'll have, where they're from, and what their budget is. After that, the next step will be a sign up form where we will gather some info such as who your bias might be, what other merch you might own (to avoid duplicates), and some items on your wishlist. From there, we will match everyone up!

In the survey post that will be coming in a few months, there will be an in-depth explanation of how everything will be set up and safeguard measures in case someone doesn't follow through. I want to thank the BTSProjects Team for being as excited about this as I was and for wanting to jump right in and help!

I hope this will bring a little bit of extra holiday cheer to the sub and give people a chance to connect with each other, as well as help some of you finish off that poster collection or get their first piece of merch!!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Closing Comments and TL;DR**

As my mom says, *omaiga!*^(oh my god) that was long, so let's do a quick recap.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **ANNIVERSARY**
&gt;
&gt; We'd like your thoughts and suggestions on doing an acrostic 'poem' as a sub. We would also like to know if and how many people would be interested in participating if we organized this.
&gt;
&gt; You can reply to our *4th Anniversary Suggestions* comment with your ideas!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Birthdays**
&gt;
&gt; We have thought about ""grouping"" close birthday projects together to maximize time for submissions and to help our small coordinating team.
&gt;
&gt; For example, JK and RM both have birthdays in early September. So we would open submissions for both projects in early June, and allow you guys to submit stuff in the following 2 months or so up until each respective birthday deadline.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts and/or suggestions about this setup? Leave them below our *Birthday Projects* comment.
&gt;
&gt; **Birthday Gifts**
&gt;
&gt; We'd like to do more charity gifts, if that's okay with you guys, as these are easier to coordinate and we can all have a chance to participate even if we are all spread over the globe.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions for future birthday gifts can be left under our *Gift Suggestions* comment.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Secret Santa**
&gt;
&gt; A sub Secret Santa is in the works! Please anticipate the formal guidelines and information post for this project!

&amp;nbsp;

Wohooo!! We've made it to the end!! Thanks for sticking with us till now ^ _ ^ So yeah, now that you've read our novel-length post, we want to hear what you guys have to say. Go comment down below!!

I ordered the YNWA albums bundle on January 25th, SUPER excited to support the boys and get my official merch, the poster, all that jazz. As an international ARMY, I am completely aware of how long shipping takes, but in this case, I definitely overestimated how long it'd be. According to the delivery report, it was unable to be delivered on February 27th. I wasn't notified, I was not given a failed delivery slip, nothing. Just a few days ago, I called my post office praying that by some miracle they would still have it. 

Welp, I guess I was Hitler in a past life because they basically told me to screw off and they don't know where my package is.

Okay fine! I'll message the BTS shop since the package was likely returned to the sender, I mean where else would it go? I'll pay shipping again, no sweat (or blood or tears). 
About 16 questions posted and emails later, I am honestly speechless at how terrible their customer service is. I really, genuinely wanted to support the official shop, rather than buying it off of Kpopmart (which I've bought off plenty of times, and have never had any issues). 

I have not gotten a single reply from the shop, and I have no idea what to do. I can't even get a refund because you need to do that through email as well. I'm really trying to be patient, but I honestly feel like I've been scammed.

Has anyone else had an experience like this or have any advice? I still very much want my albums and to support the boys, but they won't even respond to me. I have no idea what to do. *Save Me.mp3 plays* ",12,16,False,self,,,,,

I'm from bangtanbase and I wanted to shared with you the banner project we're putting together for the Manila shows (May 6 and 7).

Original post with the banner designer is on [bangtanbase](https://bangtanbase.com/topic/2191-banner-project/)

The quote used in the banner is a combination of lyrics from baepsae and not today and we're tying in Rap Monster's recent speech about teaching the word ""together"" to ARMYs.

If anyone is interested in helping us out here's how:

1. Donations! We're still a bit short of our goal and every penny helps. [Donate through this link](https://www.paypal.me/BangtanBase).

2. Spreading the word! [Please retweet the project announcement!](https://twitter.com/bangtan_base/status/851610421018722304).

3. Volunteering! If you're attending the Manila shows and would like to help pass out banners or even just grab one for yourself you can contact us through Twitter (@bangtan_base) or contact Indirianna on bangtanbase.com. Indirianna is the one attending the show and organizing things over there.

Thank you so much for your time.

If you want to buy and not trade: each photocard is **6$** (SLA Namjoon one is **$2**), each standee is **$3**, depending if shipping comes in more expensive I'm willing to lower the price. 

Shipping from Europe to worldwide; it'll be calculated when you tell me a country.

If you have any questions message me, thanks! :)

Literally bawled my eyes out because I felt them singing from the bottom of their hearts and god, I'm just unbelievably moved. :'( it was such an emotionally-charged performance and I think there's no way I won't cry if I ever hear them perform it live. Similarly, the live performance of ""House of Cards"" is so soulful and raw, it tugs too easily at my heartstrings. I feel that little ache in my heart whenever I listen to it. ~~don't get me started on Jungkook and his scat-singing~~  

When I listen to ""Blood Sweat &amp; Tears"", the emotion I associate with the song is one of mania, obsession. I think it has to do with the lyrics and the beat that seems to trap me in it. I'm not sure about y'all but whenever ""Attack on Bangtan"" comes on, I just feel unstoppable and invincible. 

""Save ME"" is the first BTS track that I came across, so when I listen to it, I feel nostalgia and a sense of solace...? ""2!3!"" comforts me whenever I feel down, and it's my usually go-to track whenever shit happens and in desperate need for a pick-me-up.

I think it's amazing how their music can transcend boundaries and allow one to feel a spectrum of emotions. Also, I think I feel too deeply when listening to music ~~(it's a curse lol)~~ and I'm curious of the sentiments that my fellow ARMYs get when listening to BTS. ",61,33,False,self,,,,,

Some of the ones I came up with were:

**Harry Potter** - Not Today. Because Harry always kept fighting, no matter what. It totally would have been the theme song of Dumbledore's Army.

**Hermione Granger** - Am I Wrong. Because she always notices things that she thinks are wrong in the world, and she tries to change them.

**Neville Longbottom** - Tomorrow. Because no matter how many terrible things have happened in his life, he keeps going and keeps trying to make things better.

**Luna Lovegood** - Begin. Because friendship means everything to her and she truly comes alive because of her connections to others.

The strongest evidence is this VCR,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHmJ7lO5qDw there is literally no questioning this.

In the vcr, whenever they mention the boy, Jin's face is almost always shown(eg, the vcr said ""the boy smiles"", followed by a shot of Jin smiling. 

From what I have seen of all the BS&amp;T teasers, the events are all polar opposites of what we have always seen. Suga comforting JK and trying to snap him out of something(in RUN, JK tried to snap Suga out of something). RM offered JK absinthe but JK didn't seem like he wanted it, but in BS&amp;T he gladly accepted it and had no side effects while in the teasers he seemed like he was suffering. Jin beating up V, but till now, Jin easily gave in to V. 

I think J-Hope represents temptation, in the choreo of BS&amp;T, he seems to control everyone's movements. The intro, boy meets evil is about resisting temptation, but, it kinda felt like, J-Hope himself was the temptation, rather than him fighting against it. Either that or he completely gave in to temptation and is now trying to get the other members too. He is always associated with pills and addictions, in another vcr, the word placebo was everywhere around him. I think he's fooling everyone into falling for temptations.


J-Hope, RM and V seem to have all fallen for temptation.

JK,JM, Jin and Suga seem to try to get them out of it or try to resist it. 

Out of all of them, Jin seems to always be the one who is neutral, not knowing where to go or what to choose. He also has his heart missing in the teaser, but not completely. He is one among the 6 flower petals, the six petal/members are a part of his heart, one of the petals is himself.

The six-petal flower is always burnt, but, burning it, destroying or ignoring emotions won't help you get anywhere. We should learn to control and understand our emotions to get anywhere. The inner conflict needs to happen to understand ourselves better. Instead of trying to burn away your feeling and trying to walk alone with unresolved issues, we should realize that these inner battles are necessary and we never truly walk alone because memories and feelings will guide us along the way.

In YNWA, I think Jin, or whomever it is, has learnt to embrace each part of them. Burning things, as Suga always does, destroying things, trying to ignore things like J-Hope and RM, lying to yourself, always hiding away won't work. JK put out the fire in the prologue and in Spring Day, JM seemed like he found a way out of the maze, J-Hope and RM seem to have fought off temptation. All the members walk up the stairs, signifying moving on, or getting past struggles, and Jin captures it, to learn from his past, to not forget these conflicts.

That's all I have got so far. Any other thoughts? I just wanted a discussion.",5,50,False,self,,,,,

Hey beautiful people of r/bangtan, a while ago I decided to compile a list of ALL US press for The Wings Tour. Most of the links were submitted here, so thanks for diligently sharing those articles and interviews! More stuff might pop up later on so I'll be updating this list continuously.

Initially I thought this was gonna be a one-page thing but [oh ma gad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQi9EhWAQ50) I underestimated the amount of articles out there. The compilation includes articles, interviews, videos, news and TV. Hopefully this makes searching easier when you want to look back/catch up on interviews, etc.

I know there are some to never, ever trust like Digital Music News, but I'm wondering about some others.

I search BTS in Google News pretty often to see what comes up and I see a lot of articles from Korea Portal and International Business Times. Most of the times they just look like the articles that show up on Soompi or Allkpop, so I'm just assuming that they don't really do their own reporting. Just kinda relaying the same news that's already out there. Or is this an incorrect assumption?

I was thinking about this because I saw [this article](http://en.koreaportal.com/articles/33703/20170504/bts-confirms-attendance-to-billboard-music-awards-will-join-justin-bieber-ariana-grande-rihanna-on-red-carpet.htm) on Korea Portal that says that BigHit has confirmed that BTS is going to the Billboard Music Awards. But I haven't seen that being reported anywhere else. Should we assume that it's fake news? Or does this site somehow have the scoop? I'm doubtful of the second option, but who knows.

Both Fire and Not Today have a cool beat and excellent rap verses. The dances are hype and make you want to party, and American concert crowds love to party (again, clarification I'm sure crowds in other countries do to, I'm just speaking from my experience). 

Then I Need U is slower and has that old school hip hop vibe that takes us all back to the 80s and 90s. And they're dancing is IMPECCABLE.

Also, all 3 of these songs have a bit of English in the chorus that non-Korean speakers can easily latch onto, sing along, and feel like they're part of the action.

Were probably all busy with voting for our boys on the BBMAS (were over 60 million as of now!) but lets not forget about our anniversary project. 

As we explained in the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/68k1mj/4th_anniversary_future_projects_discussion/), wed like to make our letters into one big acrostic poem. 

An acrostic poem is a poem where certain letters in each line spell out a word or phrase. In our case the line would be your letter. The first characters of your letters will spell out a short message congratulating our boys. The exact message will be decided on once we know how many people are interested (the length of the message depends on the number of participants). 

For example, if three people signed up, the message would be something like BTS and the first person would write a message starting with B, the next person would write a message starting with T and the last person writes a message with S. For example:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **B**oldly chasing your dreams, you inspire me so much. 
&gt;
&gt; **T**hese 7 Korean boys are amazing. 
&gt;
&gt; **S**omething I really love about BTS is the music. 

&amp;nbsp;

Hello everyone~ It's been quite some time since I've been on the sub but I'm back and with a survey! I'll begin within a little self introduction for those who may not know me (which is very likely the majority lol). 


My name is Jackie! I'm 20 yrs old, Yoonseok biased, Mexican-American residing in the US, currently working full time, and majoring in Biotechnology (RIP). This semester I'm taking an Anthropology course and for our final paper we were assigned a participation observation project in which we had to attend and study a cultural scene or event and its participants. The event was left for us to choose (with our professors final approval) and I chose the WINGS Newark concerts for my event. My professor is actually quite familiar with k-pop, which I came to discover the day we were discussing cultural appropriation in class and she chose to display Jay Park's 'Mommae' and G-Dragons 'One of A Kind' MV's, to which my reaction was ""Oh God..."" and she laughed because at that point she knew that I knew what was coming. She's also familiar with BTS, which I also discovered the day I correlated Omelas to something we were discussing in class and she replied by pointing directly at me and saying ""The one from BTS' new music video!!"" (this was around the time Spring Day was released). To say the least, I was high-key shook and low-key wanted to crawl under a rock lol.


So anyway, here I am now. I attended both days of the Newark concerts with a few friends I actually met here on the sub just 8 months ago! Honestly, what an experience. It wasn't my first time seeing BTS but I definitely think it was a completely different experience than the last by really being able to observe the audience and the atmosphere at the concerts. Now here is where my survey comes in. I've gathered all my field notes and am in the process of interviewing a few friends who attended the concert with me, but I need just a little bit more background information, so I though who better to come to than the sub! My central question for this paper is as follows:


 **""How did Korean Marketing practices mold K-pop into an international commodity?""**


The audience I'm focusing on is the International BTS fandom. Doing k-pop fandoms in general would be too big a topic for this paper, especially considering the event I attended was a BTS concert. I'm aware of the (amazing) census conducted on the sub just a few months ago and I'll be using it as a source, however, there are a few more questions I have that aren't answered by the census, or are a bit more detailed. These questions are found in my survey. The questions should take about ~15 min to complete. Any and all data / information collected will only be seen by me and used for the sole purpose of providing context and statistics in my Final Paper. Of course, I would be willing to share the data but that is ultimately up to the interest of participants and the sub in the final results. 


Any and all answers and participation are greatly appreciated! I will keep the survey open until Wednesday, May 10th 12pm EST. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions :) I hope many of you participate~! Thank you!

Are we having a great day today? Well, no matter, because it's about to get a tad better.

Ever wanted to express yourself in the sub but never found the right words? We now have a way for you to do just that!

Some of you explorers have found it already, but yesterday night I finished implementing emojis^((or is it emotes? well, anything can be an emoji if you believe hard enough, I guess)) into the sub. 

So let's talk a bit about that.

---

#The Emojis

They are extremely easy to use as **you can learn [here in our wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/emojis)** ^((by the way, visit the wiki sometimes. We always have some good stuff there)).

You might be asking: *""why do they have such weird-ass names?""* Well... we are keeping the same names as the ones we use on Discord to make it an easier transition for some of our members ^(Let's just say mistakes were made.)

A word of caution, though: as I said in the wiki, **no one likes a spammy-pants! So please beware of using them too much.**

#Mobile users

Well, here's some bad news: 

**Mobile users won't be able to see the emojis in action.** The code won't show up at all nor the images --***but* you can still write them out and be assured that desktop users will be able to see them.**

[Here's an example](http://i.imgur.com/kgaUaTB.png) of an emoji in action in case you're browsing on mobile right now.

**In case you can't see the table, [here's a screenshot.](http://i.imgur.com/FETSCFF.png)**

#Choosing more emojis to add

So here's something fun for you guys:

**After checking the [wiki page with the already existing emojis](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/emojis), please comment below with an image you'd like to see added to our set.**

We'll be using the most upvoted ones, so please be sure to vote in the ones you like!

---

Guess that's all for now. We worked hard to bring this to you guys even though Reddit will soon be deprecating CSS. Say bye bye to our theme and emoji set soon, haha T-T 

Have a lovely day, guys~

My favorites are Lost, Reflection, Hold Me Tight, Stigma and Awake (I could probably pick all WINGS songs tbh).

Do you want BTS to start a new story with a new concept?,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6abmu3/is_this_the_end_of_hyyh_do_you_think_bighit_will/,-widdershins-,1494406791,"Ok so I realized a few things after watching the mv so Im going to share my theory first. 

This is going to be *long*.
    
So first of all, Jin is the main personality and the other members are his alter egos that his subconscious created because his psyche could not support certain emotions connected to past events and periods of time in his life. This seems to be one of the popular theories from the HYYH era and the Wings short films.

Throughout the series, Jin slowly starts to realize that the others are his separate identities. However, I think Tae is aware that hes a separate identity that Jin created. Jin being the original personality aka the host means that he has control over his body. At the end of BS&amp;T (Korean version), Jin realized that the others were part of him (Jin looking at the mirror and seeing his face crack). Jin realizing this could be bad for the others because he might not need them to carry his past traumas anymore. 

Jin has several options, he could either accept his past and carry his burdens alone and stop relying on the other identities therefore reaching adulthood after coming to terms with everything and accepting the pains of growing up. On the other hand, he could turn a blind eye and pretend that he knows nothing therefore remaining willfully ignorant. 

Now lets assume Jin wants to accept his past. Therefore, he wants to take control. However, Tae doesnt want that. I think the scene of them fighting in the kitchen is Tae and Jin trying to take control over their body aka Jins original body. Which means that Tae wants to be the main host. That is why Jin apologized to Tae. Because Jin accepting his past and realizing that he doesnt need to rely on the identities anymore also means that hes going to kill them in his mind. He could also be apologizing to Tae because he only created him to separate the memories of him killing that man. It was really painful for Tae to carry Jin's memory. The guilt must have been crushing him and he is arguably the most unstable identity. 

I think the mv is not in chronological order. The scene where Namjoon makes Jungkook drink the absinthe (poison/drink/whatever that substance was) wasnt a poisoning scene and Namjoon wasnt trying to harm Jungkook. But he was actually trying to help him realize the truth and Yoongi wasnt trying to fight Jungkook in the bathroom but he was trying to help him. The opening scene of the mv happens *after* Jungkook passes out in the bathroom. He wakes up on the bed and sees the bloody marks on the bed sheets. Tae had his wings cut off and his wounds were still probably bleeding so they left a mark on the sheets. So Jungkook realizes he is also Tae and they share the same body. Oh and notice how Namjoon has bloodied fists. This further proves that they *all* share one body.

By drugging Jungkook Namjoon helps him see *through* the eyes of Tae. Which is why the mv looks like a fever dream and we the audience are also experiencing the majority of the video through the eyes of a drugged up Jungkook. Which is why the events were not in chronological order.

Now the second person who also wasnt aware is Jimin. Notice how Yoongi was always trying to shield him from the truth by covering his eyes but at the start of the mv Jimin walks away from yoongi until he reaches the corridor (the same corridor from Jins short film). Then you have that scene of Jimin opening the door and seeing his other self. Thats the moment where he connects the dots. There is that scene of him sitting on the kitchen countertop biting the apple. I think what this symbolizes is really obvious and I dont really need to explain it. 

So we can now assume everybody knows whats going on and they all plan to stop Tae but what they didnt realize is that Tae already stabbed Jin and has gained more control over their psyche (Jins subconscious aka the psychedelic landscapes we see in the mv). Which is why he could escape from Jimin and Jungkook when hobi was trying to throw the dart. It almost looked like he stopped time. Notice how the scene where Jin and Tae are fighting does not look like a fever dream and the colors look normal that is because were not seeing that scene through the eyes of Jungkook.

At the end of the mv We see Jin with a gaping hole in his chest because Tae stabbed him with a bottle (?) in the same way he stabbed his father in I need U and this is one of the many parallels.  Because Jin is the original identity, he can be considered the father or the big brother to the rest of the other identities. Tae stabbing the man in I need u (that man could be either his father or brother) is a parallel to him stabbing Jin. If we assume that Tae was an identity created later to bear the memories of him stabbing that man. Then the stabbing scene in I need U is what happened to Jin in his past. Jin stabbed the man. Then he created Tae to deal with that traumatic memory/event. Jin wants to kill Tae but he failed. In the end Tae stabs him. Thats why Jin has a hole in his chest. So basically history repeated itself. 

So what happens in the end? Is Tae the main host? Notice how the other members disappeared at the end of the mv. Only the empty sets were left and his mindscape (Jins previous mindscape) was crumbling. So I guess temptation won? Who knows. I guess well have to see what bighit does next. 

What do you guys think will happen? Is this the end of the storyline? Do you think bighit will continue with this concept? Or do you think they will they start a new series? Also what Kind of concept would you like to see next?

This is my first submission here. I hope I respected the rules correctly TT.
My friend who lives in Japan and I managed to get our ticket for TWT in Sapporo on July 2 through the 1st lotery that took place between March 9th-24th. We didn't quite check which seats we would get before balloting (I don't remember seeing any info about it) but when my friend went to get the ticket, she only got 1 piece of paper with all the infos on it. I was wondering if it was the normal procedure ? Like, will our paper be exchanged for 2 ""concert tickets"" at the venue ? 

Also, the ticket we got says ""all seats specified"". Since there is no seating plan yet I wanted to know if we will get seat number at some point or if it'll be on a ""first come first serve"" basis... just to make sure if we need to come early for the queue or not since I also want to get some merch lol ;; 

I hope I've been clear enough because I really have no idea how japanese concerts work. Thank you!! ;;",8,10,False,self,,,,,

TOP is in the military, but there would be no reason SK wouldn't allow him to perform at the Olympics as part of his service. Lee Minho is starting his tour of duty (at the same police station) and he's one of the ambassadors. 


I saw some speculation about Psy, but given his anti-American rap lyrics, I'm not sure he would be invited. I know America isn't very popular right now given certain political events, but it seems like having him perform would drag up a lot of ugly press about SK in America and I don't think SK would want that. 


BTS has the biggest global/international presence right now. They would seem to be the perfect choice to participate in the ceremonies in some fashion. ",16,40,False,self,,,,,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OnRVU0ybAA


Theres this YouTube account called Her Jams that posts videos relating to BTS. Most of these videos have click-bait titles. This one in particular appears to have been posted with good intentions, however it has sparked a lot of unnecessary anxiety and vitriol within the ARMY fandom. 


(Part 1  HATING ON BTS/ARMY) 


ARMYs have been enthusiastically voting on Twitter for BTS BBMAs nomination for Top Social Artist, including on unrelated posts (ex. Billboard articles on Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, other nominated categories, and so forth). We are a large fandom. A significant portion of the fans (especially the ones active on social media) trend towards the younger side. There will be immature fans. There will be fans who like to get a rise out of others. There will be fans who dont care if theyre being perceived as insensitive or disrespectful. No fandom is immune to these issues and we cant police everybody. However, we can and should call out these individuals when we see these instances occurring.  


ARMYs routinely receive criticism and hate for promoting BTS (sometimes in rude waysex. spamming a comment section with posts about BTS when the original content did not relate to BTS) across most social media platforms. This will make some people unwilling to support BTS or give them a chance. You cant stop this from happening. 


There is a perception that boy groups (aka boybands) or young male singers/performers (especially attractive ones) have fanbases built on the support of teenage girls. Yes, a significant portion of fans will be made up of young girls/women (in high school and university). For some strange reason, the very fact that most fans are young girls will lead others to write off the talents of these artists and attribute their success solely to raging teenage hormones. You cannot force people to like BTS. I like to promote BTS too but shoving them in peoples faces wont endear them to anybody. 


That being said, BTS has the talent and the ambition to prove people wrong if they judge them on their merits and not their fans. Justin Bieber, for example, got a lot of hate when he was younger. Remember Bieber fever? People called JB gay, called his fans crazy, said his music was terrible, etc. He grew up, came back, and it seems like a lot of people have changed their opinions about him. One Direction (boyband) faced the same issues. People called them gay, called their fans crazy, said their music was terrible, etc. Theyve grown up, gone their own ways. People have changed their opinions about them. BTS (I believe) can do the same. Their talent will speak for itself. It will be enough to change some peoples minds and let them see past the crazy fans. 


(Part 2  FALSE INFO) 


The uploader (in their YouTube description) says they are from Tunisia, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and believe that something has gotten lost in translation. Under Billboards 2017 voting rules, they state (Page 4, Voting Restrictions): https://www.billboardmusicawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-Billboard-Music-Awards-Official-Voting-Rules-1.pdf 


dick clark productions, inc. (Producer) reserves the right to disqualify the votes from any individuals/entities it suspects or finds: (a) to have engaged in manipulated and/or inauthentic voting practices; (b) to have tampered with the voting process; or (c) to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner or with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other person.


The votes of some ARMYs under non-related posts could be viewed by Billboard as violating (c) acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner or with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other person. Personally, it does seem unsportsmanlike and rude but doesnt really annoy/abuse/threaten/harass any specific individualits the fans/antis that are getting pissed off. 


HerJams appears to have misinterpreted the rule to mean that BTS will be disqualified from the category itself. That is not true. If Billboard or any other awards show worked this way you could just spam nominees until theres only one left standing. What the rule means is that the votes under other artists posts (specifically from Billboards Twitter account) could be deemed invalid. And thats only if Billboard views the issue through that perspective. 


The problem here is that HerJams has a sizable subscriber base and since a lot of ARMYs spend time on YouTube, the information they have presented here has led to like 90% of the viewers thinking BTS will actually be kicked out of the category. And that false information continues to spread on Twitter. It is misleading and people are overreacting. People should fact check and learn to not take everything at face value. 


Additional note: It annoys me how ARMYs always get called out for bringing up BTS on a non-related video. If any other topic was brought up no one would care. And were the worst fandom for supporting/promoting BTS and leaving YouTube comments? People have done far worse. 

*** Remember to vote on Twitter and Billboard!

So gorgeous and SO CONFUSING that I just had to write a ~~long-ass dissertation~~ fan theory. To approach the MV from as unbiased a perspective as possible, I've been purposely avoiding other fan theories for now, and you don't know how hard it's been not to dive face first into everyone else's interpretations, haha. Since I'm stupidly late to the game, this will proooobably get buried, but I'm posting for my own sanity if nothing else. So without further ado

&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR: BTS's Japanese MV for Blood, Sweat, and Tears depicts the struggle of growing up. The members of the rapline either help the maknae line begin their journey towards adulthood (Rapmon, Hobi), or they attempt to delay it (Yoongi). Jin, already an adult, is an outside observer who comes alongside to help, but he may already be too late.**

&amp;nbsp;

If you don't care to hear me drone on about colors and would much rather talk about what the hell actually *happens* in the MV, scroll down 'til you see Jin's name. For ease of reference, I made it really big ~~just like his shoulders~~

But if you don't mind a long read, here's *why* I think what I think. The MV makes a thousand percent more sense when you keep two things in mind:

&amp;nbsp;

**1\. The scenes are NOT shown in chronological order.** The best examples of this are the opening shots of V and Jungkook:

- Vs scene at 1:40 takes place immediately before 0:17 (aka, the scene where he basically stumbles through Bangtan's kitchen looking high). Notice how at 0:17 Jimin and Jungkook are positioned on either side of V. This looks like a direct continuation of the scene from 1:40-1:43, where they flank him and hold him steady. Also, if you freezeframe 1:55 right after Hobi's little 'shh', you can see that V turns his head to his righthand side, flinching. Now look at V in 0:16: still facing to his right. Meanwhile [0:21] Hobis hand is raised and extended like he's just thrown a dart (freezeframe right at 1:42 and you can actually see the dart).

- The scene where Jungkook falls back onto the bed and passes out [2:11] takes place the night before 0:02 (aka, the opening shot where he basically wakes up The Morning After and notices his wings are gone).

Knowing that the scenes are shown out of chronological order adds a layer of confusion to everything, but it also lets us piece together a more logical sequence of events (as opposed to taking the order of the MV scenes at face-value). This is especially important for V's scenes later on.

&amp;nbsp;

**2\. The colors matter.** A lot. Yes, they're chaotic and crazy, but don't just chalk them up to the absinthe: they're central in picking apart the MV.

&amp;nbsp;

**Red and green are used interchangeably to represent temptation.**  
(If you already agree, just skip this section and spare yourself the wall of text.) The apple is a common symbol of temptation and of gaining access to some higher, forbidden form of knowledge. Right away we see Jimin with an apple (notice how the red stands out in contrast to the rest of the scene), establishing red as the color of temptation. Subsequently, whenever we see strong red lighting, it generally accompanies a scene where someone is either wrestling with temptation or has succumbed to it already. Examples of red scenes:

- [0:38] By removing Yoongi's hand from his eyes and walking away, Jimin is essentially walking away from his innocence and choosing to embrace temptation (in previous MVs, the piano has been strongly associated with childhood).

- [1:07] Jungkook falling to temptation and dealing with the aftermath [1:24, 2:56]

- [2:44] Jimin up against a mirror, contemplating some internal struggle

- [2:22] V climbing to the roof, where it looks like he's about to fall or jump [3:24]

- [1:00] This Jimin-scene isn't lit with true red (more of a red-purple), but because we see Jimin biting into the red apple (and because the scene is juxtaposed with Rapmon's temptation of Jungkook), the intended symbolism is still successfully conveyed. Also, the accompanying scene of Jimin blending up the apple *is* lit with true red [1:01].

Later, we see the red merging (literally) into green, the color of the absinthe [1:02-1:05], indicating that the colors are being used interchangeably. Both objects (apple, poison) and both colors (red, green) essentially represent the same thing. Sometimes we see them together, like in solo shots of Rapmon [0:51, 0:53, 3:21], who is clearly depicted as a tempter [1:07].

&amp;nbsp;

**""Color explosions"" ~~no I'm not great at naming things why do you ask~~ represent the moment of transition from childhood to adulthood.**

Obviously, in real life, most of us can't pinpoint just one moment and say, ""That's when I grew up."" Growing up is a journey, a series of moments. But for dramatic purposes, the MV portrays growing up as a singular, intense moment where you 'awaken' from childhood to adulthood Colors explode, glass shatters, and there's an overall feeling of being out of control and overwhelmed [2:12, 3:14-3:18]. It's even a little violent.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Blue represents innocence.**  
Childhood, safety, and ignorance. An unformed state, without knowledge of good and evil. (Again, if you already agree with me here, skip aheaaaad ~~omg why would you actually read this, don't do this to yourself~~.) Examples of blue scenes:

- [0:14, 1:33, 1:38, 3:10] Basically any scene where Jimin is sitting on the couch. Interestingly, he never lacks access to temptation (the apple is always in his hand), but he has yet to taste it.

- [0:41, 0:45] Most of Yoongi's solo scenes are blue, and he's established as a character whose role is to preserve innocence. By covering Jimin's eyes [0:37, 3:12], he is keeping him in the dark, keeping him a child. The image at 0:36 that Yoongi blocks from Jimin's view is a statue of an angel and a demon. Meaning that Yoongi is withholding knowledge of good and evil (like the Abrahamic God in the Garden of Eden).

- (Most of Hobi's scenes are blue, too, but since Hobi's character is a tricky bastard, I'll get to that later.)

More evidence that blue is intended to represent innocence: as the maknae line struggles, we tend to see red and blue fighting for dominance. Temptation (red) has been introduced to a previously childlike state; now it's up to the tempted to see which side will ultimately win out. Examples:

- [1:34] Jimin taps his finger against the apple, clearly considering it. The red of the apple stands in clear contrast to the blue of the surrounding room.

- [1:10] Right after Jungkook drinks absinthe, the backdrop switches from blue to a mixture of red *and* blue swirling around each other [1:13]. The colors don't look like they're mixing together - rather, they're separate and vying for position in the center (see how the central color shifts during 1:12-1:15).

- [1:24-25] In this close-up of Jungkook, the light is primarily red, but there's clearly a secondary light source somewhere the right half of Jungkook's face is red, but the other is blue. Similar lighting choices are used in film to depict moral struggle (think Luke Skywalker in Episode 6 ""so you have a twin sister"").

- [1:46] I probably don't have to explain why the image of V moving around beneath a bunch of bed sheets is sexually suggestive haha. Easily a situation representing temptation. And look at the colors at play: red and blue.

Given that red stands for temptation, and how often the MV chooses to contrast red with blue, it stands to reason that blue stands for the opposite of temptation - namely, a perpetuated state of innocence and goodness.

We also see the importance of blue in relation to the ""color explosions"". Pause around 2:11, right as Jungkook hits the bed, and you'll notice that the predominant color is blue. But as the wall shatters, there's a brief flash of pure red, followed by a ""color explosion"" of reds, blues, oranges, and yellows. Rapmon, Jungkook's tempter, watches the results of his handiwork; pieces of blue glass fly across the screen [2:15]. A similar moment happens with Jimin at 3:13: at first, the predominant color is blue, then he's pulled violently into a world full of red, blue, yellow, purple, green, you name it, it's there. As Jimin's world erupts into color, Jin watches; more broken glass flies through the air [3:17]. In both scenes, blue is the default state preceding the members transition to a new world. If the new and colorful world represents adulthood, then the blue world preceding it must represent childhood.

**So blue represents the innocence of childhood, red and green both represent temptation, and an explosion of colors represents a transition into adulthood.** Adulthood is overwhelming at first - hence the chaotic ~~super trippy~~ colors [2:12, 3:15, 3:19] - but after a period of struggle, the colors ultimately settle into something more peaceful and balanced [0:10], indicating a new state of mind.

&amp;nbsp;

And now we finally we get to the good stuff.

**Based on the members' interactions with each other, as well as the colors and symbols associated with each member, their roles in this MV are as follows:**

&amp;nbsp;

#Jin:
**Outside observer.**

Whichever theory you subscribe to (""Jin is dead"", ""Jin is the only one alive"", or ""Jin is the only adult""), you can probably agree that Jin tends to be separated from the other members, and this MV is no exception. Look carefully at the group shots. At 0:17-0:21, Jin is the only absent member. At 1:57, although technically present, Jin is sitting at a distance, in shadow. (The shadow is even more obvious at 1:58, when Hobi pours out the pills.) The only members seen to actually interact with Jin are V and Rapmon, and I would argue that the V scene [2:00] is actually the last one in the MV, chronologically speaking (more on that later). The Rapmon scene confirms that Jin has been absent for a while: Rapmon is surprised to see his friend, and Jin agrees, ""it's been a long time"" [4:06].

My personal theory is that Jin spends most of the MV in another world, completely removed from the other members. (Whether you want to interpret this as the world of adulthood, or an actual other dimension\* such as the afterlife is up to you. I think both are valid. The important thing is that he's separated.) At 0:29, Jin is seen using a painting and a spyglass to watch over the maknae line. The painting depicts spiritual warfare and the predominant color through the spyglass is red, representing an ongoing struggle with temptation. As we look through the spyglass, the scene shifts: first we see the painting, then a statue of an angel and a demon, and finally Jimin and Yoongi. These shifts in scenery (even though the spyglass and painting themselves haven't budged an inch) seem to suggest a layered reality - alternate dimensions or worlds that occupy the same space in time but are separate.

So Jin watches. He's invested in his brothers' world and clearly troubled by their suffering [1:28-29, 3:18] but all he can do is watch. That all changes towards the end of the MV, where to stop the maknae line from completely self-destructing [3:24-25, 3:29], Jin willingly leaves his world to enter (or re-enter) theirs. Clues include the portal [3:27], the sudden change in color palette [3:33], the shattering glass, and the transition to the gas station scene. Unfortunately for Jin, helping the maknae line comes with a cost, represented by the hole in his chest [3:36]. What cost, exactly? Maybe his soul, maybe his future death at V's hands, or perhaps the hole is a representation of self-sacrifice in general. (I think these are all plausible, so I'm not going to pick one theory over the other.)

&amp;nbsp;

^^\*Edit: ^^Shout-out ^^to ^^/u/Sassinak ^^for ^^providing ^^a ^^very ^^convincing ^^argument ^^why ^^the ^^other ^^dimension ^^may ^^actually ^^be ^^a ^^[mirror](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6avyp2/hidden_stories_of_jbst_namjin_edition/)! 

#Rapmon:
**Agent of change. Tempter. Can probably be resisted.**

Rapmon has the least ambiguous role out of all the hyungs. Look at the motifs they're assigned. Yoongi has a piano, Hobi has tons of weapons, Jin has an opera spyglass. Rapmon, meanwhile, has fricking absinthe. (If you're a younger fan and are unfamiliar with the substance absinthe makes you trip balls. Massive, hairy balls.)\* So, the scenes between Rapmon and Jungkook are a very unsubtle way of portraying a young person's fall to temptation. 

Rapmon pours a glass of absinthe and gives it to Jungkook to drink [0:48, 1:06], starting him on a journey towards Self-destruction? Self-discovery? Adulthood? ~~The toilet?~~ Probably all of the above, based on one of Rapmon's quotes from Demian: The bird fights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God's name is Abraxas.""

It's interesting to note that, after successfully tempting Jungkook, Rapmon takes on a very passive role throughout the rest of the MV, similar to Jin. He is present and observant [1:03, 1:16, 2:14] but no longer an active participant in the 'fall' of the maknae line. He plays his part and is then content to watch. The one possible exception is in 3:21, where we see Rapmon standing in front of a stage, surrounded by broken glass. When Rapmon holds up his hands, we see that they're badly and newly cut, showing that he's responsible for the glass (recall that broken glass accompanies the ""color explosions"" in 2:11 and 3:13 that indicate passage from childhood to adulthood).

&amp;nbsp;

#Jungkook:
**One of the tempted. Wants to change, and does.**

The opening shot of Jungkook is beautifully symbolic of his character's awakening from childhood to adulthood. As Jungkook rises from the bed, the colors on the wall shift from blue (innocence) to red (temptation) and finally to a balance (no longer predominantly blue or red but a harmony between them that includes purples and yellows). The only other time we see this balanced mix of colors is during Jin's scenes - hinting that Jungkook has achieved what Jin has: self-discovery. Part of self-discovery, though, involves the loss of innocence: looking back at the bed, Jungkook sees bloody prints where his wings used to be [0:26]. 

#Yoongi:
**Opposer of change. Guardian of innocence. Can be resisted.**

Yoongi's role is to keep the members of the maknae line in a state of childlike innocence. We see him covering Jimin's eyes twice [0:38, 3:11], keeping him ignorant to the world. In 3:11, Yoongi's actions cause Jimin to drop the apple altogether, reinforcing the idea that Yoongi is there to help the maknae line fight temptation. 
 
As for Jungkook's scenes, notice the difference in how the bathroom is lit when Yoongi is and isn't present (1:22-1:28 vs. 2:55). The predominant color at 1:22 is red, but definitely not as saturated a red as we later see in 2:55, when Jungkook is at his lowest and temptation has won the day. When Yoongi is present (1:22), we see not only red light but also blue, indicating an ongoing struggle in which the childlike part of Jungkook could still win out. Yoongi shakes Jungkook, probably to encourage him to vomit even more of the absinthe, but that's not what Jungkook has in mind: he throws his elbow at Yoongi and forces him to back away. So instead of expelling the rest of the absinthe, Jungkook lets it take its course.
 
Interestingly, when Jungkook and Jimin resist Yoongi, he accepts their decisions. When Jimin runs away in 0:38, Yoongi doesn't try to stop or pursue him - he just stands there and watches. And after Jungkook pushes Yoongi away [1:27], none of the subsequent bathroom scenes indicate that Yoongi is present; hes given up on Jungkook.

#Jimin:
**One of the tempted. Wants to change, but something holds him back.**

Since there are two of them, I'll call the first one blue!Jimin [0:14] and the second one rainbow!Jimin [1:31]. ('Cause that sweater is intense.)

Rainbow!Jimin is interesting, because the moment we meet him, he *immediately* abandons his place of childhood innocence and seeks out temptation. He uncovers his eyes, hauls ass away from poor Yoongi, and wastes no time getting into trouble: the next time we see him, he's already biting into an apple [1:00]. (Recall that, based on how it's used in 0:58-1:08, the apple is a stand-in for drugs/absinthe/temptation.) Interestingly, no one is there offering the apple *to* rainbow!Jimin; he finds it all on his own. He's basically his own tempter.

Later on we see rainbow!Jimin walking purposefully down a dark pathway [1:38]. He wipes his mouth, like he's just finished eating the apple. This scene is intercut and contrasted with shots of blue!Jimin, who is still considering the apple and hasn't yet tasted it. But pay attention to rainbow!Jimin's surroundings and how dark they are. Look how stark the lighting is, compared to the usual super-saturated reds and blues. Where's the ""color explosion""? Where's the trippy psychedelic backgrounds and shattering glass to signal rainbow!Jimin's awakening from childhood to adulthood? This is a Jimin who has thoroughly attempted to leave childhood behind by embracing temptation but temptation hasn't given him what he was looking for. He's still a child, and he's still searching.

His search continues until 2:59, when blue!Jimin and rainbow!Jimin finally meet. Seeing blue!Jimin sitting with an untouched apple and covered eyes is the catalyst that launches rainbow!Jimin into a brand new world: we finally see a ""color explosion"" and shattered glass (similar to Jungkook's moment at 2:11-2:15). My theory is that blue!Jimin is the part of Jimin's identity that's still holding on to childhood, and only by acknowledging that part of himself does rainbow!Jimin finally 'awaken' and become an adult. (Notice that rainbow!Jimin spends most of his time either biting into apples or running down ominous hallways, while blue!Jimin stays seated, indicating the passivity of his character. Jimin can't move on until he's willing to face up to both sides of himself - the side that's seeking and the side that's stagnant.)

The contemplative shots of Jimin with his head resting against a mirror [2:44, 3:25] suggest an ongoing inner struggle (further suggested by the strong red lighting): Jimin is still trying to reconcile the two sides of himself. Although he's an adult now, he still has issues to confront and resolve.

#Hobi:
**Agent of change. Cannot be resisted.**

Out of all the members, Hobi was probably the most difficult to categorize. His role isn't as obvious as Rapmon's or Yoongi's. Visually, he seems benign, possibly even angelic: his solo scenes are generally lit with blue [1:51], and his room [2:47] is full of feather-like objects, suggestive of angels and wings. There's even a piano, which in 0:39 (and in Bangtan's previous MVs) represents childhood innocence. So all this visual evidence probably tips Hobi towards the side of 'good' or at least 'neutral', right? Well, problem is, most of Hobi's actions can be interpreted different ways. Sure, his dance scenes *could* represent fighting temptation but they could also represent giving in to temptation (or even offering it). His weapons [1:41, 1:49, 2:50] could be used for good or, just as easily, for evil. What about the pills at 1:58: is he destroying them, or is he adding them to a concoction for the others to drink?

So there's a lot of ambiguity behind Hobi's character. Lots of questions, lots of possible interpretations. *But.* One scene in particular strikes me as a clarifying moment, and it's the scene where he shoots V.

&amp;nbsp;

Blink and it's gone, but if you freezeframe 1:42, you can clearly see Hobi on the left, poised with a green dart. And not just any green, but a bright, poison green like the absinthe, suggesting the dart is (yes, *another*) a symbol of temptation. Fun fact: Poisonous darts or barbs are a biblical representation of the devil's words. Also, the devil is commonly described and depicted as an 'angel of light', which could explain why Hobi is frequently shown not in red lighting, but blue. The blue is meant to be misleading, to symbolize how temptation can masquerade as goodness. The rarer shots of Hobi in non-blue lighting [1:41, 1:49, 3:30] can then be interpreted as glimpses of his true self. On the other hand, I don't want to get *too* carried away with the Hobi-as-devil comparison. It's interesting, but it doesn't quite sit right, because awakening from childhood to adulthood isn't inherently good or evil, it just is. It's painful but necessary. So, as an agent of 'awakening', Hobi himself isn't inherently good or evil, either. His weapons are painful but necessary. His role is simply to open V's eyes to a higher truth, thus affecting change.

If this is you right now...

[](#v_what)

Remember that ""color explosions"" were used in 2:11 and 3:13 to signal Jungkook's and Jimin's passages from childhood to adulthood. To recap, both ""color explosions"" started with a backdrop of blue (representing innocence), which was then replaced by a chaotic palette of other colors, along with broken glass (representing how their old world had been shattered and replaced by a new one). Compare that sequence of events to what Hobi's arrows do when he shoots them. The first time he shoots [1:50], we see a splash of pale blue, which is quickly swallowed up by a splash of red above and green below. The blue (V's innocence) vanishes almost immediately: it never had a fighting chance. The second time Hobi stands poised with a bow and arrow [2:50], we begin again with a backdrop of blue. When he lets the arrow fly, what do we see? Another explosion of color. So, like Rapmon, Hobi instigates awakening from childhood to adulthood.

However, *un*like Rapmon, Hobi has an unwilling victim. Rapmon's victim (Jungkook) was an active participant in his own fall: he was offered absinthe and pressured to drink but the decision to 'awaken' was ultimately his own. (Look how the shot of Jungkook drinking is back-to-back with the shot of him calmly putting his finger in his mouth [1:06]. No one's forcing his hand. He's also very calm when Rapmon brings him the cup [0:58]). If he had wanted to, I think Jungkook could have chosen to resist Rapmon. V, on the other hand, looks powerless and scared [1:40-43]. Jimin and Jungkook pin him place. Hobi takes aim [1:41] and shoots [1:49, 1:55]. V doesn't get a choice.\*\*

So you *could* interpret the green dart as temptation, but I think the more likely case is that the dart (and by extension, Hobi himself) represents forces beyond your control. Sometimes you don't fall to temptation - sometimes life just sucks and external pressures (whether troubles at home, mental illness, physical illness, bullying, assault, etc.) force you to grow up, ready or not.

&amp;nbsp;

^^\*\*This ^^is ^^probably ^^why ^^Yoongi ^^is ^^shown ^^to ^^interact ^^with ^^Jimin ^^and ^^Jungkook, ^^but ^^not ^^with ^^V. ^^Yoongi ^^represents ^^the ^^forces ^^that ^^try ^^to ^^keep ^^you ^^from ^^changing, ^^even ^^when ^^you ^^want ^^to ^^- ^^meanwhile ^^V ^^is ^^in ^^the ^^exact ^^opposite ^^situation, ^^i.e. ^^not ^^wanting ^^to ^^change, ^^but ^^being ^^forced ^^to ^^anyway. ^^So ^^there's ^^no ^^need ^^for ^^Yoongi ^^to ^^try ^^to ^^plead ^^with ^^V ^^the ^^same ^^way ^^he's ^^shown ^^to ^^plead ^^with ^^Jungkook; ^^V ^^and ^^Yoongi ^^are ^^already ^^in ^^agreement.

&amp;nbsp;

This finally brings us to

#V:
**One of the tempted. Does NOT want to change. Is forced to anyway, which drives him insane.**

Poor, poor V. The last and hardest to fall, and it wasn't even his fault. ~~damn you Hobi just kidding I love you what~~

Most of V's scenes are pretty trippy. Not just because they portray, well, a thoroughly unhinged psychopath, but also because a lot of them happen out of order. True, his aren't the only scenes that jump back and forth in time (Jungkook in particular is another culprit), but the other members still have pretty straightforward journeys in comparison. My guess is that the disordered chronology of V's scenes is meant to parallel his disordered mind. I believe the correct sequence of V-related events is this:

1. [1:40-1:55] V is forced to grow up before his time.
2. [0:17] When it's too much for him to handle
3. [2:17] he snaps. We then see him climbing the stairs with a screwdriver in hand, and honestly the first word that comes to mind during his close-up at 2:19 is ""pants-shitting"". I'm going to have nightmares about that face. We do see some old score marks alongside the new one he's carving, indicating that he's made this climb before, so we've probably jumped forward in time.\*\*\*
4. [2:25] After climbing the stairs, he passes through a room draped in sheets and lit with red. (The bedsheet scene at 1:46 is probably meant to mirror this and represent the same moment in time - similarly to how the clips of Jungkook at 1:06 and 1:07 accompany each other and represent the same moment in time.)
5. [2:28] V climbs through the window onto the roof.
6. [2:42] The sky he sees is an impossible color, confirming that he's not in a right state of mind (see 2:45 for comparison).
7. [3:23] V stands on the roof, as if ready to jump.
8. [3:27-3:30] Jin sees that V is in danger and decides to do something about it. Notice how the screen flips upside-down at 3:28-3:29, and we see V in an exaggerated red filter, similar to the effect used earlier for Jin's spyglass [0:35]. True, Jin's been watching the maknae line from the very beginning, but the creative decisions behind these shots suggest that seeing V up on the roof is the tipping point that drives Jin to act. (I think the shot at 3:30, where Hobi looks up at a pair of wings, is also meant to represent V on the rooftop. The wings are raised high above the ground, mirroring V's precarious situation, and they shift from blue to green, mirroring his inner distress. Immediately following this shot...)
9. [3:33] Jin leaves 'his' world and rejoins the 'old' one in an attempt to help the maknae line, particularly V.
10. [3:53] Not knowing where to find V, Jin first visits Rapmon (since V and Rapmon are closely connected in the previous MVs, Jin knows that Rapmon would be the best shot at finding V).
11. [2:02] Unfortunately, by the time Jin finds him, V is already completely unhinged (we're treated to another pants-shittingly terrifying face in 2:07). Jin tries to subdue V and temporarily succeeds, but pauses in between punches to tell V that he's sorry. (Sorry for not getting to him sooner? For not being there in the first place? For having to beat him to a pulp? Probably all of the above.) Unluckily, V seizes this opportunity to overpower Jin and rush him with a broken bottle. (Personally I'm not sure V actually succeeds in killing him [2:10]. I hail from the school of nothing's-confirmed-without-seeing-the-body-and-even-then-it-has-to-be-decapitated-and-DNA-tested. But who knows. ~~I'm probably just Jin-biased~~)

&amp;nbsp;

^^\*\*\*That, ^^or ^^they ^^just ^^did ^^lots ^^and ^^lots ^^of ^^takes ^^and ^^didn't ^^care ^^about ^^covering ^^up ^^the ^^old ^^marks ^^lol.

&amp;nbsp;

**Closing thoughts:**

Damn. I feel like I just wrote a novel, and there are *still* things I want to cover before wrapping up.

&amp;nbsp;

There are certain scenes I haven't really touched on, reason being, not all of them actually add to the plot, haha. For example, I'm 95% sure that Hobi's and Jimin's dancing scenes from 2:31 to 2:42 are mostly there to look pretty, add energy, and help tie everything back to Bangtan's previous MVs. Same goes for the bathroom smoke at 2:56. Sure, you could probably interpret it as an oncoming force of evil, but its probably just there to look cool and add some movement to the scene. Not to say scenes like this are unimportant (theyre definitely important in building an atmosphere), but they don't necessarily scream ""dissect me in a ten-page theory"", either. (Admittedly, the remaining 5% of me is itching to write that ten-page theory and suspects Hobi and Jimin may be duking it out in a spiritual battle for V's soul ~~but that's because I'm silly~~)

&amp;nbsp;

Another note: I'm pretty sure Rapmon plays two different, unrelated characters in this MV. On the one hand, there's ""supernatural"" Rapmon who functions as a tempter and agent of change. He's essentially a demon, minus the moral connotation, and therefore he operates in a different plane of existence. On the other hand, there's the ""real"" Rapmon, who works night shifts at a gas station, wipes his ass in the morning, deals with substance addition, and shares the same plane of existence as the maknae line. That's why I think ""supernatural"" Rapmon and ""real"" Rapmon are meant to be completely separate characters (just played by the same actor). So when Jin hands ""real"" Rapmon a lighter, it's not connected to ""supernatural"" Rapmon's story. It's just meant to acknowledge that Rapmon is an adult, and to remind us that the 'lollipop' he carries around is actually a cigarette (as seen in ""I Need U"").

&amp;nbsp;

If my theory is true (or at least true-ish, since that's probably the most I can reasonably hope for), then theres one question left to solve regarding Yoongi and V. If Yoongi opposes change and protects innocence, then why doesn't he make an appearance to try to protect V from Hobi, Jimin, and Jungkook at 1:40? Why isnt he there to block the dart or intervene? One possible answer is: the MV is complicated enough as it is, and even the ~~possibly high?~~ director and editor knew where to draw the line. Another possibility is: we never actually see the rapline interacting with each other. We briefly see them frozen in time at 0:20 (with Yoongi sitting on the couch, Rapmon standing next to him, and Hobi on the far left), and the fact that they're clustered together suggests an association, but their sole focus is the maknae line, not each other. Maybe they have a standing agreement to not interfere directly with each others functions, but to let the chips fall where they may based on the maknae line's choices? But yeah, this is another situation where I'm basically going to throw my hands up in the air and say, who knows. IMO, thats not a bad summary of this entire MV. Who really knows. Ive shared my personal interpretation, but there are so many possible ones, which is a huge part of why I love Bangtan's MVs and YAY NOW I CAN FINALLY READ ALL THE OTHER FAN THEORIES SEE YOU IN ABOUT A MONTH WHEN I EMERGE.

&amp;nbsp;

If youve made it to the end OH GOD WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

But more importantly... Strong power thank you!

[Long time no see.](https://gfycat.com/RepentantLividChafer) So the JBST mv is three days old already, but I know I'm not the only one whose brain is still working overtime trying to figure out wtf I just watched. I will probably make another post soon dedicated to all my random observations and not-quite-theories, but for now, I just want to talk about a particular phenomenon I noticed (and that I'm sure a million eagle-eyed tumblr users noticed long before I did). 

Upon first viewing, this mv is a jumble of chaotic, beautiful, disturbing, surreal images -- intentionally similar, I'm sure, to the experience of taking certain *ahem* illicit substances. However, on closer inspection, I believe there are remnants of more linear and lucid narratives beneath all the disorder. It's just that those narratives have been broken up, distorted, and presented out of order. So, much like a groggy freshman waking up the morning after a party,* it's up to the viewer to try and figure out: *what the hell happened last night?*

^^*Not ^^that ^^I ^^have ^^experienced ^^this. ^^Haha, ^^of ^^course ^^not! ^^Purely ^^hypothetical, ^^my ^^friends.

A word about pairings: everyone knows the best buds of the HYYM-era storyline were [Rapmon and V,](http://imgur.com/a/GELwH) [Jungkook and Suga,](http://imgur.com/a/ZR2v9) and [Jhope and Jimin,](http://imgur.com/a/iFceT) with odd man out Jin. Each pair is made up of one maknae and one hyung. For Wings, the lineup has been swapped - now it's [Rapmon and Jungkook,](http://imgur.com/a/wYT8s) [Suga and Jimin,](http://imgur.com/a/V7mTM) and [V and JHope](http://imgur.com/a/VeaLt) (Jin is still Forever Alone). Again, one maknae paired with one hyung. The pairings in particular, and the age difference in general, are especially significant in JBST now that those relationships seem to have taken on a darker power dynamic. Just something to keep in mind.

WITHOUT FURTHER ADO. There are three main stories which have been smashed up and scattered around throughout this mv: Jimin's story, Jungkook's story, and V's story (the maknaes, natch). These stories are seen largely, but not entirely, as hallucinations. We're given glimpses or just clues as to the state of things in the real world, but they're enough to make some educated guesses. Note: In the upper left of the gifs, I put the timestamp from the mv at which each image occurs.

[JIMIN'S STORY](https://gfycat.com/TestyKeenAllensbigearedbat)

Let's start with Jimin (feat. Suga), whose story occurs first, chronologically speaking. But wait, how do we know it's first? Tell ya in a minute. Jimin's hallucination imagery is the most subtle and the least trippy of the three, except for [that one part at the end,](https://gfycat.com/HopefulFriendlyHomalocephale) but it's extra mind-fucky in other ways. First, there are two of him -- the innocent-ish Blue Jimin and the more ambivalent Orange Jimin (blue and orange are extremely prevalent, and extremely symbolic, throughout the whole mv). Second, the adventures of BlueJimin and OrangeJimin combine to form a perfect loop. BJM sits in the parlour, contemplating (but not eating) his apple, and experiencing a palpable sense of foreboding. He sees a split instant of OJM coming through the door before Suga materializes and covers his eyes, but it's too late. He pushes Suga's hand away, only now he *is* OJM. He leaves the alley, thoroughly disconcerted but determined to return to go back and ... fix something, maybe. OJM arrives at the starting point and sees BJM, the shock of which sends him rocketing off into psychadelic overload. The BJM that he saw becomes the new OJM, and the cycle begins again. Perhaps because Jimin's hallucination is the most concrete and fleshed out of the three, we get the *least* amount of information about where he is externally as all this is occurring internally. I'm going to take a guess and say that the fleeting glimpse of [Jimin in front of a mirror,](https://gfycat.com/DisguisedTalkativeCockroach) which doesn't appear connected to anything else, is the most likely candidate. Jimin gazes at his mirror image and hallucinates a scenario in which there are two versions of himself.  

[JUNGKOOK'S STORY](https://gfycat.com/DefenselessDiscreteBlacknorwegianelkhound)

Next up is the long strange trip of Jeon Jungkook (ft. Rapmon). Jungkook's hallucination is a two-parter, I think. First we see a stylized / dramatized interpretation of the circumstances under which JK imbibed the substance in question. It probably really did involve Rapmon as the provider, but probably *not* in a creepy bare room with a conveniently psychadelic neon backdrop. Another clue that the hallucination is already underway is that JK is rocking a [thousand-yard stare](http://imgur.com/a/datfV) before the glass ever touches his lips. From there, it's a pure trippy explosion of light and distortion with not much in the way of events or narrative. At some point, the location changes from the window-room to the room with the bed and paint-covered walls. As far as corresponce to real world / external locations goes, I think the window-room is a stand-in for wherever JK actually took the drugs, possibly Rapmon's room in Bangtan's shitty bachelor pad du jour. Similarly, the room with the bed and the paint on the walls is really just the floor of the bathroom with graffiti on the walls. Even as the hallucinations play out, the mv gives us [a pretty straightforward look](https://gfycat.com/ExhaustedMistyFanworms) at real world events during this time. (Oh hi, Suga!)

[V'S STORY](https://gfycat.com/CourteousBlankHadrosaurus)

The last story, chronologically, is V's (with a JHope cameo). It's broken up into very small fragments that go by very quickly in no particular order, which for me made it the most satisfying one to excavate and piece together.  V's hallucination is exactly like Jungkook's in that it begins with a dramatization of how V came to take the drug. [Bangtan, minus Suga,](http://i.imgur.com/dbQtCvf.gifv) appear to be having a shitty house party. In the shitty kitchen of the shitty bachelor pad, V is restrained on either side by evil-looking maknae bros Jimin and Jungkook. They hold him still while, overseen by RM, JHope prepares to throw [a green dart](http://imgur.com/a/YcRHD) at him. V cringes to the side, and it's heavily implied that JHope throws the dart, especially when taken together with [certain images](http://imgur.com/a/JTCpf) from [the JHope scenes,](http://imgur.com/a/IvEvh) including [this one](http://i.imgur.com/tVKBFbe.gif) from KBST. The instant the dart hits, time freezes and V's trip begins in earnest. His consciousness wanders away from the scene in a dreamy state, passes through a tunnel of silk, and escapes to the roof for some serious communion with the primeval. Where is V's body while his mind is out and about? It's subtle, but there's a case to be made that he never leaves the kitchen. This is suggested by the way time stops and everyone remains frozen in place at the moment of the dart's impact, i.e. onset of the trip. It's safe to assume that V didn't go anywhere either. I think we do get a scene of V in the real world, and it's not pretty; it's the fight with Jin. The lighting of the kitchen in this scene is completely different than before, and it's also the closest thing to natural lighting we see in the entire mv, which is a strong indication of its reality. If I had to imagine a possible scenario to explain what we see here, and what happened leading up to it, it would be this: the morning after the party, Jin comes across V still in the kitchen, still tripping balls. V's trip has resulted in a [very dark state of mind](http://i.imgur.com/OZppD6g.gifv) by now which he acts out by attacking Jin. What the mv shows us is Jin's retaliation -- not that he gets the upper hand for long. By the way, the thing V grabs off the floor to stab with? [Yeah, it's a bottle.](http://imgur.com/a/BqqBH)

Now here's my rationale for the chronological order of Jimin --&gt; Jungkook --&gt; V. Jimin makes sense as the first of the three maknaes to take the drugs, or grow up, or turn dark, or whatever other metaphor you like. For one thing, his symbol for the loss of innocence is the apple, which in a biblical sense is the first / original sin. As more concrete proof, once he bites the apple, [he puts the rest of it in the blender,](http://i.imgur.com/t3c8pJd.gifv) where it turns green and becomes Jungkook's absinthe. In turn, V's symbol, the dart, is also green and also in the kitchen. But we know for sure that Jungkook's events preceded V's simply because there's already a dark / evil version of JK present during V's downfall.  

If you made it this far, thanks so much for sticking with me! As hard as it may be to believe, I actually tried really hard to focus on the events of the mv, and to hold off on more in-depth analysis / speculation / comparison to past storylines. I might make a whole other post for that barrel of monkeys. (As an example, did you notice that the [hole in Jin's sweater](http://i.imgur.com/yCO9rnZ.gifv) is in the exact same place where his [lily petal babies](http://i.imgur.com/oHqavZI.gifv) used to be?) In the mean time, I hope you enjoyed this! Don't do drugs, kids!

I don't think I have it in me to make another gigantic thousand-frame gif, so this one may be mostly screenshots. Shoutout to u/SleepyJeannn whose awesome and not-at-all late [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6auyvw/super_late_fan_theory_for_jpn_blood_sweat_tears_mv/) had a few critical observations which caused a ton of stuff click into place for me.

TL;DR Jin is trapped in a mirror and Rapmon busts him out. I agree, it sounds ridiculous, but bear with me. 

Let's look specifically at the scenes of Rapmon in [the room which is his solo set.](http://imgur.com/a/XABmk) First off, it's an intentional callback to his (much nicer) [room in KBST](http://imgur.com/a/3EeLh) -- they both have a cabriole loveseat, a down-bridge style lamp to the left of the loveseat, a small table for absinthe paraphernalia, various draped and thrown fabrics, etc. The JBST room contains one key feature, however -- the floor-to-ceiling mirror which dominates the back wall. As shit is generally reaching its peak on all fronts in the mv, we start to get the recurring [shattered glass](http://imgur.com/a/HEXIv) visual. But in Rapmon's case, it's not just glass that was broken -- specifically, it's his [mirror.](http://imgur.com/a/8aHVk) And what's more, [he's the one who broke it.](http://imgur.com/a/uobdx) (Pause a minute to recall RM's short film [Reflection,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzxjM-82RW8) which included a [shit-ton of mirrors](http://imgur.com/a/OFWOU) and the [shattering](http://imgur.com/a/twNdQ)  thereof.) But *why* would Namjoon smash a mirror, getting all cut up in the process? What could he hope to gain from that? Short answer: Jin. 

Jin (or at least, the sweater-wearing version of Jin) has spent the whole mv seemingly trapped in a dark, undefined space containing nothing but a [mirrored surface and an oppressively large image of Bruegel's Fall of the Rebel Angels.]( http://imgur.com/a/IIRYP) As glass starts to fly in Rapmon's world, [Jin's world follows suit](http://imgur.com/a/aq5TK) to a catastrophic degree. Even the [floor](http://imgur.com/a/57pg8) begins to break apart (in a very [familiar](http://imgur.com/a/vKGGD) way), and at the last instant we see [this image,](http://i.imgur.com/vJJFB6p.png) reinforcing the idea that Jin has been essentially trapped in a mirror. And not just any mirror, but a two-way mirror, which explains how Jin has been able to keep tabs on Bangtan's hijinks but not to interact with them. 

There's a kicker here, and it's all about the paintings -- yes, paintings, plural. Because once Rapmon's mirror is in pieces on the floor, it's revealed that hiding behind it all along is a second Bruegal work, [Landscape with the Fall of Icarus.](http://imgur.com/a/dlDKR) This painting, especially when considered as a companion to Fall of the Rebel Angels, is all about a young man falling from the sky / out of the clouds (metaphorically, from a more celestial realm) and crashing back to earth, the more mundane realm. The mv [transitions directly](http://imgur.com/a/bu8PV) from Landscape with the Fall of Icarus back to Jin and Fall of the Rebel Angels. Only now, there's a nice big portal which looks an awful lot like the sky in Landscape. In breaking the mirror and revealing the second work, Rapmon has opened up a way for Jin to slip between paintings and fall back to the real world. 

So what are the bigger implications of all this in the ongoing storyline of the Bangtan mvs? Honestly, no clue. Maybe the next one will be all about Jin fixing shit and taking names. But as far as the JBST mv goes, it makes that [last scene](https://youtu.be/7OX7dIRReSA?t=230) no less confusing, yet just a little more poignant.

Hey ! Wir sind eine kleine Gruppe von Personen die versuchen die deutsche BTS Gesellschaft zu strken. Daher haben wir uns entschlossen ein Discord Server zu erstellen und fr diesen Werbung zu machen. Nach etweiligen Versuchen durch deutsche fanpages ne promotion zu bekommen haben wir uns entschlossen auf eigene Faust zu gehen. Wir sind noch ein sehr leiser und kleiner Server aber hoffen frher oder spter endlich etwas grer zu werden &lt;3

Zu dem Server : Wir besitzen neben Bias-Rollen, Neben-rollen, Events &amp; Bias-Channeln auch noch Autoupdates fr einige BTS News und deutsche bersetzungen fr einiges mehr. 
Ziel des Servers wre Deutschlandweite Events besser planen zu knnen und einfach nur spa zu haben.

Fr mehr Fragen bin ich gerne Verfgbar. 

Invitelinks : https://discord.me/dearmy oder https://discord.gg/dZYM6dK

Hoffen wir sehen uns dann dort :3

Any additional money will be contributed as a donation to a charity as our gift. As of today, we have considered 3 charities, please let us know what you think about them or if you have any other to recommend: 
 
[Korean Suicide Prevention Association](http://suicideprevention.or.kr/m/main/main.php) -- *Partnering with the Korean Association for Suicide Prevention (KASP), the Young Health Programme in Korea focused on increasing awareness of mental health and helping prevent young suicide.* Entire website is in Korean, but there is a bit of information [here](https://www.younghealthprogrammeyhp.com/programmes/korea.html). 
 
[Oak Tree Project](http://www.oaktreeproject.com) -- *Oak Tree Project is a scholarship fund and mentoring program for Korean orphans who get into college. Korean orphans are on their own after they graduate from high school and are in great need of financial and emotional support. This program enables them to succeed and keeps them accountable until they graduate.* 
 
[Kids Future](http://eng.kidsfuture.or.kr) -- *Kids Future has a mission to provide diverse educational opportunities for children and youth in the world to assist them in preparing themselves and their communities for a better future.* 
 
Deadline for charity donations will be **9 June at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL** time. 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
 
Thank you for reading through, and if you didn't here's our TL;DR (we gotcha): 
 
&gt; We're still looking for a volunteer living in or visiting Korea for the first week of June. We need the finished book shipped to BH, and the BTS Projects Team will cover all costs. PM if you can help us.  
&gt; 
&gt; If you're planning on submitting a fanart, please check your inbox(es). We have sent you a message to discuss your submission (concept-wise and if you're doing a double submission). 
&gt; 
&gt; If you're planning to submit a fan message please give us until Wednesday to assign you a letter. If you haven't received a letter by then, please PM us. 
&gt; 
&gt;Coordinators will cover all printing+shipping costs, but you are more than welcome to help us. Also, we have been considering three charities to pair with the anniversary project. Please let us know what you guys think or if you would like to recommend a charity (it doesnt have to be Korean). 
&gt; 
&gt; Deadline for fan art and fan message submissions: 30 MAY at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL time 
&gt; 
&gt;Deadline for charity donations: 9 June at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL time 
 
&amp;nbsp;

How do you find the amount of dedication that ARMYs tend to put on stanning the boys ( from voting and tweeting to concert events and all ) How has been your experience around other ARMYs? Is there anything you hate about the fandom? or anything you admire about this fandom? Also How do you perceive all the hate that ARMYs tend to get from Kpop fans and other non-kpop fandoms (maybe)?

We all love the boys and want to know them as much as we can without being intrusive or invasive. I'm not a certified psychologist or anything, but reading about different personality types has always been a 'hobby' of mine. I don't mean to try to dissect and critically analyze BTS and act as if we know every crucial detail about their lives, but I am interested in respectfully discussing each member's unique personality facets! :D

Though we may not ever be 100% certain which type belongs to which member, I can't help but find myself pondering on what type they *could* be! It would be interesting to discuss how us, the fans, see each member and try to take a guess on what type they would be.

It was however, totally baffling and I had to rack my mind a couple dozen times over. After watching the MV several times, I've compiled an analysis of the mv and how it loosely connects to the HYYH trilogy as well as the Japanese BS&amp;Ts. 

The first shot we see is J-Hope tapping Tae on the shoulder, before the camera zooms in on their faces, expressing that the entire music video is a mental projection into their inner psyche. We are taken to a brief, minimalist credits roll to emphasize the bold, but simple nature of this production as a strong statement towards society. Throughout the music video the boys often stare directly into the camera while lip syncing, but with their eyes obscured. (I'm going into this deeper later, please bear with me)

Scenes that stood out:

**1. The lack of lipsync**

Even though all the boys are paired with their respective lines, their lips don't match up with the lyrics of the song. Although others may accuse them of simply forgetting their lipsync or not taking the MV at utmost seriousness, it holds a deeper symbolic meaning. The lyrics themselves talk about the disparity of society, and how social pressures can be crushing. Thus the fact that their lips don't match up signifies the ignorance society carries as a whole towards this issue, further supported by the boys' frequent smiles and clear amusement. Whether in ignorance or in mockery of society, it's hard to say.

**2. Rapmon in the elevator**

Namjoon keeps constantly being tied to the elevator, a symbol of luxury, which he consistently gets in and out of. Not only does the elevator going up and down signify the ups and downs of life, but also resembles Namjoon's personal hell and torment. Furthermore, the other boys go into the elevator *with* him, which can be interpreted two ways: 1) either they are in a similar state of suffering 2) they *themselves* are Namjoon's personal demons, not only just following him around but also invading his personal space and streaming it live.

**3. The camera pan on the couch**

About a quarter into the video, all the boys are seated on a couch where they look at each other dramatically in turn. I think this is because they are all turning away from the guilt of being a member of the bourgeois and are trying to pass it onto the next member. Jhope is the last of this line, and he whips his head towards to camera, accusing the *viewers themselves* as guilty of ignoring society's issues; but then, the camera turns to Jungkook, who is clearly wearing an [anguished expression of pain](https://68.media.tumblr.com/b6a614a5e9903cf52ca879ef3cef5e91/tumblr_oq2v6r8lof1t41sdbo1_500.png), 
 showing a complex mixture of both elation at his everyday life as well as his internal burdens.

**other pieces of symbolism:**

-*Jin stuffing his face with food* in the corner can go two different ways: As related to the **Blood Sweat and Tears** Korean MV, we can link this to a display of gluttony, one of the Seven Deadly Sins. As the Japanese Blood Sweat and Tears link the HYYH Trilogy and BS&amp;T universe, we can attribute this to Jin's spiritual and mental isolation in the face of this confusing, symbolic shitfest.

-*Jhope sitting on the toilet*: 
The explicit lyrics include: *""Dirty clothes for you, dirty clothes for me, everyone's experienced it before""*. Not only do his multiple sunglasses symbolize that Jhope has multiple perspectives on society, but the fact that he's on the toilet and rapping about clothes makes the connection of the pain of soiling oneself in the lower reigns of society, both figuratively and literally because he's soiled himself in the bathroom. The line *Everyone's experienced it before* indicates that this is indeed a nation-wide concern, indicating the global outreach of this MV.

-*the chicken dance*: 

The [chicken dance](https://68.media.tumblr.com/57e4cc93c94f633f470edc783e057e64/tumblr_oq2w3b6Zzq1t41sdbo1_540.png)
 that the boys do really summarizes the theme. As of the release date of the MV, it's the **Year of the Rooster**. The rooster is associated with ambition and wealth across many cultures, and the boys doing this symbolic dance here shows off the outpouring of greed and corruption within a seemingly idealized world. The lighting is nearly blinding, implying that the boys' world is heavenly, mystical, and otherwise 

**IN CONCLUSION**

Sunglasses and those luxurious upper-end pearl jackets also contribute to the theme of willful ignorance, as even though the boys are frequently staring into the camera, we as an audience cannot truly meet their eyes. There's a lot of confusing symbolism and repetition. Frankly, I'm trying to fit this MV in the BTS mv timeline and I'm going to have to go with that it's where Jimin ends up after being launched out the door in the Japanese BST MV, because he's now trapped in this alternate dream world with projections of his friends as he's slowly--or perhaps already been--hypnotized by the pearl jackets, swirling sunglasses, and chicken dance.

**tldr: the SPINEBREAKER music video represents the boys who have fallen into the clutches of affluent society, but shows hints of their internal nuances while they are doing so**

I feel like we could really expand on how this fits in with the HYYH trilogy more, but I'm definitely going to have to watch it a few more times, and maybe submit it to MV Survivor.

I have a few for all the boys but I was curious to see if anyone else had a quirk I should look out for in the future! :) (tl;dr at bottom)

Rap Monster: just the sheer 'genius' inside him. And I know people will be like 'oh he's just so much more than his smart brain' but what I'm saying is that a high IQ doesn't always equal being 'smart' or 'gifted'. My sister and I both have IQ's in the 130's-140's but I'm not even considered smart in school because I spend most of my time watching B--... anyways, my sister puts in a lot of time and effort into her work. I'm talking about the capacity in which he can take something he likes and transform it into *art* which is just always incredible to me.

Jin: maturity. After watching Bon Voyage I told my mom even if someone gave me money to go on a trip with BTS I'd decline because every single one of them lost something or screwed up (spoiler alert)(J-Hope: tickets, Jungkook: opening fire doors, Jimin: luggage, RapMon: his fucking passport, Suga: iPad (almost), V: hops on a random bus (impulsive as hell)). From what I can remember, Jin was the only one that didn't have a fuck-up. Now I know he has his dad joke moments (which I vehemently hate but my family vehemently loves) and he has his child-like moments too but I really appreciate how polite he always is. He always says hello, always bows, and just straight up seems like a really nice person.

J-Hope: smiles. I personally think those who have been hurt or those who are hurt laugh more because they've experienced sadness so they either a. want to cheer others up, or b. relish the non-painful moments by smiling and enjoying the time as best as they can. I can tell J-Hope is always tired or stressed out but his laughter isn't fake either. He genuinely always cracks a smile on my face. I guess the less serious quirk is his blood type A. He's literally the definition of a triple A, it's kind of hilarious how terrified he always is of everything :D

V: pronunciation. At first it kind of irritated me because I had no idea wtf he was saying (or as my mom describes: does he have a pillow in his mouth?) but now I find it kind of cute. Sometimes he's super excited and trips over his words and other times I know he talks like that because he just really doesn't give two fucks. The mix of the daegu accent and seoul accent also reminded me of good times because people used to make fun of me for the exact same reason (having a mixed dialect screws you over because people from both regions go 'wtf are you saying'). I kind of find it hilarious how clear his Japanese pronunciation is compared to his english or Korean but that 'round' kind of voice fits so well with his low and husky singing voice.

Jimin: kindness. I don't know if it was just me and my friends but I feel like you might not know BTS but there's no freaking ways you don't know who Jimin is. My friends (who aren't even into Kpop) looked at a picture of Jimin and went 'oh yeah isn't that Jimin?' and even they were confused as to how they knew. As for me, I watched their Dope MV for the first time and during the dance/chorus, I saw one guy who was just amazing at dancing and immediately thought 'Ah, that must be Jimin' when I couldn't even remember what the title to the song was. There's an alluring charm about him. To me, even more than his (incredible dancing), his kindness sticks out to me the most. He always takes care of others with that gentle, sweet smile, and he puts others before himself whether he's asked to do so or not. With that level of talent I expected cockiness and arrogance but he seems to always put being polite and kind and leaves showing off for the stage.

Jungkook: how he's literally good at EVERYTHING. I wish I was exaggerating when I say this but I know for a fact that my sister despises him because she's jealous he can literally do everything so well. Whether it's just mini-games or dancing/singing/rapping, he does it ALL. Someone said 'he might not be good at studying' but I bet if he tries, he'll rank 1 and put all of us to shame. There must be a lot of pressure though since people now expect him to always be good but I really like seeing his child-like self come out every once in a while to show that he's just enjoying his time as an artist.

Suga: as my ult. bias I don't really know if I can pick one particular thing out but I guess if there is one thing that made me really appreciate him, it's his humaneness. Idols can feel so far away and almost surreal, but there's just something so human about Suga. He takes experiences from his past, both the monotone and the exciting, good and bad and transforms it into art. Despite being Korean I was never really into Kpop until Seventeen debuted and then BTS once the Wings album came out. Excluding Seventeen (who was a rookie group), Suga displayed the one thing I've always yearned for when watching idols: his ability to remember the past to be humble about today. I don't mind when he says 'I'm the smartest' or 'I'm the best' because that can all be for a good laugh. I have no sympathy for those that went from rags to riches and then turned arrogant thanks to their now-wealthy status, but Suga is probably one of the only idols (excluding underground) that talks about his inglorious past in such a conservative country. I would never have the guts to do so. He doesn't take things for granted, he got to where he is today through pure blood and grit and he remembers to value today so he can appreciate the yesterday's and look forward to the tomorrow's.

*Not saying the rest were just lazy bums that climbed to stardom easily--this is just my hyper-observation about a guy I really appreciate so much and I know you can say the same about the other members too.

*Also, I am aware that these 'quirks' can all be applied interchangeably so don't come after me with a sword. Just because Hobi has a great smile doesn't mean I don't think Jimin and V are cute too. And just because I think Suga is humane doesn't mean I think the rest are monsters (LOL). These are just the ones that stood out to me the most in each member. I appreciate every single one of them.

TL;DR:

RM: turning hobbies into art

Jin: maturity

J-Hope: smiles

V: pronunciation

Jimin: kindness

Jungkook: how he lives up to 'golden maknae'

Suga: humaneness",52,69,False,self,,,,,

I'm sorry to say this but I'll have to stop doing survivors for a while. I'm going to have some *really* important exams next month and I want to focus on studying as much as possible (tbh, hosting the survivors takes more time than I thought it would). I'll probably come back with the japanese discography survivor in late june / early july (worst case scenario late july, but I probably won't have to be gone for that long).

And by the way, thank you everyone for being so enthusiastic about the survivors, at the beginning I was afraid it would be a flop but we ended up having so many rounds haha. I hope you are all still interested in the game, it has been really fun to host it and there's still so many other survivors we can do as long as you want it to keep going.

See you all in a few weeks :)",22,56,False,self,,,,,

- **RM and the three maknaes:** 

I've noticed that Namjoon always switches his focus on different members of the maknae line that aren't that confident and makes an effort to cue or mention them during interviews. For example, when JK first debuted, he was silent in interviews and RM kept encouraging him to take the mic. He also constantly praises Jimin when Jimin was scrutinizing his own performances and V for his taste. 

- **Jimin &amp; JK:**

Jimin has a younger brother that is the same age as JK and Jimin always mentions that he misses him a lot. Even though Jimin sometimes playfully express the ""Jimin-JK love"" excessively for the cameras, you can tell that he sees his younger brother in JK (especially they are both from Busan) and takes care of him. One thing that caught my attention is during Bon Voyage, JK was sleeping on the couch and Jimin just pulls up a blanket and tucks in him silently, then plays with his phone beside him for the whole night.

- **V and J-Hope:**

I've noticed Tae always praises Hobi bluntly LMAO. Even though in interviews, he often slips in his admiration for Hobi out of nowhere and Hobi seems so taken aback by it every time haha. For example, I recall that in a Japanese interview, the members were discussing who was the most hardworking member and everyone chose Jimin, but Tae made an effort to pick Hobi because ""I saw him dancing in the studio till dawn until he had no strength in his thighs"". He also expresses his love for J-Hope's verses a lot (""my favourite part is Hoseok hyung's verse etc."").

- **Suga &amp; Jin**

These two interact like same-age friends. I remember that the members have stated that Jin is a very chill person off-camera, and I feel like these two speak in a very comfortable manner. Suga doesn't intimidate Jin, and Jin doesn't treat Suga as a younger brother. Funnily enough, both of them become very active when interacting with others (Suga and J-Hope, Jin and the maknaes) but when they come together their conversations feels really chill and peaceful.",46,152,False,self,,,,,

How far are you dreaming now for BTS? When I asked this question last year, many of this reddit were really pessimistic about their rise in America, which I still agree with, considering race issue, cultural difference etc. But if we widen the time span generously, and if we allow ourselves to enjoy a bit of wishful thinking, how far do you become optimistic about their career for next few years? 
 BTS has achieved almost all of what they said publicly that they wanted to achieve step by step. No 1 at Korean music shows, concerts, Daesang, and now Billboard. All dreams seem to be coming true. Now, what do you dream about them? 

I dream big about them. I want them to become big international star and household name worldwide, which is possible if only they continue to release great song and keep up with the amazing stage performance.  I really hope that they will release songs of HYYH level. All their songs in that series were emotional, relevant, beautiful, and most importantly, unique. Whenever I hear their songs like Save Me, I need you, Baesae, Paldogangsan, Ma city, Heungtan Sonyenodan, I am repeatedly awed because I never heard that kind of song and lyrics combination from any other artists. The songs are owned by BTS, a to z, and they are so pleasantly unique, unlike other cases where all the groups from the same company have similar sounds. Wings songs are more polished,  but personally, it is HYYH songs, style, and choreography that stun me everytime with their uniqueness. 


Now that BTS is getting a lot of spotlight domestically and internationally, I am hoping they release just one more song like Save Me: Unique, inspirational, beautiful, perfect rap and choreography, and BTS members being boys so naturally in the mv. So many Korean muggle mention about the song, and I think if they can release that level of songs at least one time more, that will be explosive. One more hope is that their mvs continue to show member's acting, but with a bit easier and a bit more obvious story, because I want to see members' serious acting, not in the real movie or drama, but in BTS movies. 


For me, the road to success looks easy: if only their songs and performances perfect as they have been, the road to bigger name will be paved naturally. I have big trust in BigHit management. It took for BTS four years  to rise to become the biggest act in Korea, and another four years will see them getting more recognition internationally. I see it because BTS does not look short of inspiration and energy, and they have the best team relationship (not only personal relatinship but work ethics) I've ever seen in idol groups, and Bang PD nim is no joke in his smartness and affection to the boys. 



Maybe, I am to much into them and all this sounds bullshit to someone, but  I feel they will fly much higher than now! What do you think guys???

#Basic Info  

The 2017 Billboard Music Awards will be held in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA and will be broadcast live in the United States on the TV network ABC. Red Carpet starts at 6PM EST, show begins at 8PM EST, and ends at approximately 10:30PM EST. [List of announced performers so far.](https://twitter.com/BBMAs/status/863932947769970689)  

**Award BTS is nominated for**: *Top Social Artist*

[Timezone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20170521T220000&amp;p1=179&amp;p2=235&amp;p3=137&amp;p4=70&amp;p5=136&amp;p6=438)  

#Where To Watch/Stream Links   

******

##For those in the USA with Cable:  

If you are in the USA and have cable, you can watch the RED CARPET on E! starting at 6pm EST, and the MAIN SHOW on ABC starting at 8pm EST. ABC should be around channel 7 (more or less), as its a local channel.  

**Note:** It might not be listed as ABC in the channel guide (for me [I have Comcast Xfinity] it was listed like WJLA or something but it IS in fact ABC, with the ABC logo in the corner and everything lol).  

* There is also an [ABC live stream on their website](http://abc.go.com/watch-live) if you have no actual television around you, however you will need to log in to verify your cable subscription. There are some geographical restrictions though.  

* You might also be able to stream it on your computer by logging into your account for your cable provider and using the **Live TV** option that livestreams channels you have access to. I know this is possible with Comcast, as I've tried it, but there should be similar options for other providers.  

* E! has a [live stream of the red carpet on their website](http://www.eonline.com/now/live), again you need to sign in using your cable provider to make it work (click on the video and it'll prompt you to sign in)  

*****

##For International viewers/those without cable:

* ***OFFICIAL RED CARPET TWITTER LIVE STREAM (starts at 6pm EST):*** https://twitter.com/i/live/848949278580002819  

* The show/red carpet might also be airing on E!, TNT, or TLC internationally, check your local listings.  

~I will update with any other streams our international friends will be able to watch as I see them.~  

* Stream one: [kpopstream online](http://www.k-popstream.com/2017/05/live-2017-billboard-music-awards-with.html)

Anywaaaays, it would be expected that there would be an increase of new armys after tomorrow (win or lose). And even during the BBMA voting, there are a lot of new armys, celebrities, not-so-celebrities and non-celebrities. And its really annoying that some armys are doing 'they are using bts'.

So, maybe we should do a WELCOMING PARTY for new armys,(lets ignore their fame status or 'they are using bts' idea, seriously, its the other way around, coz for the next comeback half of this people would purchase albums, merch and help on the livestream). 

Just think that we were once a new army before, and wealth/fame status should not matter,coz at the end of the day we are all just fans. 

Also, it is an important opportunity for us to educate this new fandom (to decrease to occurence of problematic fans) about our culture (the what should and should not i.e. stalking them on public, racist jokes, voting system in korea, etc). 

Lets discuss on what should we do here or if we are going to trend something after bbma. :)

Just a note, media reactions are just fun to watch. There will be hyped, ignorant, spiteful and speculating ones. Even though most articles I linked are positive (mostly just reporting), make your own judgement about which sources are reliable!

TLDR; awesome decision to go, bangtan is awesome, and they love ARMYs.

My friend and I originally had tickets in the upper section but after the seating chart came out, sold/rebought tix in Section 5, closer to where the boys were sitting. Technically limited view but they were totally fine for us! 

We flew in this morning so just stopped by the red carpet / hung in the back to see if we could catch a glimpse. We see this white hummer limo drive up with a massive eagle and are like nah, that's probably not them, that's not really their style and then joke was on us because screams ERUPTED when bangtan got out. 

After we saw some glimpses of hair and foreheads, we headed towards the entrance but saw there were barricades with some black gauze/mesh stuff. We could see them doing a few interviews so hung out there for a bit. As the boys were walking from one interview spot to the main interview area, we cheered and Hobi and Jungkook both waved :). They def could hear the ""BTS BTS!"" chants during the interview cause we did! 

Fast forward to us sitting in our seats, we were almost at the back of the section but had clear sight line to bangtan's seats. Shoutouts to the 3 girls in our section who brought in their ARMY bombs- you the real MVPs (turns out security was allowing them after all!)! 

So we're sitting and all of a sudden I hear this ROAR and lo and behold, bangtan is walking in and taking their seats! We were all shouting / cheering for them and it was awesome!! Even that early, you could tell ARMY was representing well (and which RM later talked about)!

All the boys were just having a great time enjoying the performances, bopping around, etc. A few people came up during breaks to take pix with them too! 

I honestly SCREAMED SO LOUD when they won and I almost don't even recall seeing them walk on stage / accept the award / say their speech cause I was so like AAHHH?!! I was just desperately trying to remember the moment and record it (total fail) and there were just soooo many ARMYs cheering/screaming it was incredible. 

While there were quite a few other ARMYs in our section, there were also a whole lot of people who were like ""what the...who are these guys"" based on our loud screaming, haha.  It was an incredible moment to see it live though and be cheering with so so many other international fans. 

They were gone for a while, but eventually came back to their seats. We did another ""BTS BTS!"" chant to celebrate and got lots of waves, including a big one from Jimin!  Hobi gave us a big heart too - old school style with hands on the head ;). Other people were congratulating them too! 

They left their seats riiight before the end of the show and we all cheered and waved to them as they left and they waved/head nodded (Yoongi) as they left :). 

Other observations:
- We chanted ""BTS! BTS!"" a few times but we didn't do it every commercial break which I thought was great and it didn't disturb the other artists. Our section got lots of waves from all the boys!! 
- They were all in to Nicki's performance!
- Taehyung has just such a joyful response / dancing to other artists. Seriously how he is when he does like VLives/other award shows is how he was dancing along / getting into the other songs
- Mentioned this in my short live update, but JK fist pumped when they announced Justin Bieber as a top male nominee and it was hilar.
- JHOPE IS LOVE. Seriously, he gave our section SO many waves and hearts. Taehyung gave us lotsa love too.  
- Jimin was bopping and definitely feeling Sam Hunt's song/performance :)
- Yoongi getting in to some songs was so cute. Clapping his hands and all!
- When Diddy mentioned Biggie, RM put his hands out like ""yesss"" 
- Even from afar, Jin just gives off that hyung vibe. 
- There were some fanboys in our section and when they shouted ""BTS!!!"" the boys immediately looked over :D. Yessss fanboys! 
- I love bangtan + staff interactions too. Def looked like they were filming a bomb and Tae (who was sitting next to the staff) kept talking/bopping along to the staffer :) 
- They honestly just looked so happy to be there and amongst all these artists and I'm SO happy they had the opportunity to attend - and WIN! ",24,211,False,self,,,,,

What do you think the 2nd half of 2017 will hold?  I personally am hoping for a new album in the fall, thought I'm not sure what kind of style to be honest.  It probably won't be too hip hop and will probably follow the EDM trend which honestly I'm totally ok with, especially if they could collab with a DJ (marshmello is my personal vote, I would actually die).  

I also am really hoping for something solo from RM, maybe mixtape 2?  I'd love to see how he's grown musically.  

I also would REALLY love to see Hobie come out with a mixtape that's more of a dancetape really, he seems into EDM and I'd love to see him collab with more DJs in the genre (can you tell I love EDM lol). 

I'd also really love to see them get more into the fashion world, especially Tae and RM.  Tae would kill a runway.",57,55,False,self,,,,,

As someone who tends to be the fuck-up, someone who honest to god has trouble establishing new habits consistently, I think the bbmas voting thing has really helped me out (praying also that this post hasn't jinxed everything).
Just the mere fact that I voted every day, 100 times each for 2 facebook accounts and a newly made twitter account -- it made me feel stronger, because it showed me that I could stick to something productive (""productive"" lol) every single day for a longish stretch of time. I was so used to failing myself before that the fact that I stuck to this simple task really surprised me. 
Tbh, I know it doesn't make sense to find meaning in something like this, but I'll accept whatever gets me motivated at this point. :)) 

Wbu guys? How has BTS affected your lives, for better or for worse? (For me, BTS has affected me a little worse in the sense that I spend a lot of time watching their content and get sucked unhealthily into fangirl obsession.

Here's a translation from youtube comments:

Credit to @BTS0222 ENGLISH TRANSLATION:

""Trainee."" No matter how you look at it, this is my existence, but it's also a word that I can never explain. A time when I was comfortable with nothing and could do nothing, a transitional period. The most concerning things about living that trainee life were the questions that my friends and family asked, like ""When will you come out?"" ""When will you debut?"" I couldn't give them an answer, because I also didn't know. Because I also couldn't know the answer.

I came with confidence and some belief in myself, but what awaited me was a truly different reality. Even now, after three years, even if I have the self-confidence to think ""when I go out, I'll conquer the music industry. I think I can do it."" when I hear the criticisms of the PDs and teachers, I feel as though I am nothing, that I am nothing but a speck of dust. It's as though ahead of me is a deep blue ocean, but when I turn and look, there's a vast desert waiting behind me. 

With this hourglass-like mindset, within that attitude, I spent my three years as a trainee. and now my debut is just ahead.

Even when I've debuted, maybe there will be different seas and different deserts that await me. but I am not afraid, because the things that have made the me of now are the oceans and deserts I've seen.

I will never forget them, those seas and desserts I have seen. Because I am a trainee.

---

They've really come so far. I love how they have so many logs and unofficial songs/tracks so that we can go back and see their thoughts and goals from pre-debut. Now BTS is achieving their wildest dreams, and we're experiencing that with them! 

It's lame, but I'm really disillusioned about my future these days. But seeing BTS literally achieve their dreams makes me want to dream big, too. Haha sorry so sappy.

Here's their other hidden track from 2Cool 4Skool called ""Road/Path""! I only heard about it bc Jimin said it was his favorite BTS song. It's also about their trepidation about the future, so I really love it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pmLodIvfA4

Please comment if there are other hidden tracks I probably haven't heard! I'm making my way through their soundcloud releases right now, and it's a goldmine. Thanks guys!",12,49,False,self,,,,,

I freaked out when I found out that Jimin and Taemin of SHINee danced together, also when BTS and Block B performed at MAMA together.  The dream is to hear a duet with V and Baekhyun of EXO!

K-pop aside, and this came to me the other day, I would love it if Jungkook lent his vocals to an EDM artist like Zedd, Alessio, or deadmau5.

 So, I recently got introduced to BTS, and K-Pop in general, by a friend and I'm really enjoying it.. especially their MVs and analyzing them and see how it could connect to one another and  their hidden meanings.
Plus, it's great they won the award which will give them more exposure and maybe one day come where I live.

 Also, a bit off-topic, but I found this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDOs7S_9ogM which is pretty cool but I've been trying to find what song it is. I know the original is by ""Weekend Revolution "" and it's called ""Never make it out alive"" but I've been trying to find this version in particular. 
If anyone knows could you pm me? Thanks in advance!

I heard that fanclub members get a presale -- obviously tickets are hard to score in general, but will this make it impossible for me to go? What is the Korean ticketing process like, for BTS and other concerts in general (if it's different)?

Additionally, without fanclub membership, is it possible to go to their stages on music shows? It'd be great to see just one, but I heard they sometimes take people based on how much merchandise you have or something -- would I be able to get in? Thanks!",9,15,False,self,,,,,

So it's no secret that after BTS's win at the BBMAs recently, they're increased in popularity by a few folds. Meeting western celebrities left and right, attending interview after interview, announcing collaborations. I'm sure they've been on cloud 9 since and I really, really, REALLY want to be happy for them, BUT - 

IS ANYONE ELSE SCARED FOR THEM????

I'm not really sure what I'm so worried about myself - there's so many things that are worrying me that it's hard to describe everything in a concise manner. For one thing, I guess I'm scared that they're peaking now and that they won't be able to maintain it??? I'm scared that down the line they'll receive criticism that they weren't able to outdo themselves after their 2017 BBMA award. Their American award also reminds me of when other kpop groups (SNSD, Wonder Girls, etc.) entered the American market and kinda just fizzled out. 

Furthermore, for some reason I hate the fact that they're meeting all these celebrities and perhaps setting up future collabs with them. I had the same sentiments back when PSY hit big with the western media because, frankly, I felt as if he was being treated as a novelty. *Look at this weird music video by this funny, chubby Asian man!* This sort of thinking kinda goes hand-in-hand with YouTubers making BTS focused videos (normally reacting to their MVs). Obviously, this is probably just a projection of my own reservations and whatnot, but I absolutely do not want the same thing to happen to BTS. I appreciate them and their music so much, that it would pain me so much to see them being used and treated lightly by ""bigger"" and ""more influential"" western celebs. But then again, I'm probably just overreacting :/

Are you guys worried about anything that might come out of BTS's recent rise in popularity?

Edit: Thanks for all the great answers guys! It really helped to quell the panicking guy inside me lol. Just to clarify (albeit belated), I'm NOT worried about this being their peak! Should have worded that bit better XD I just don't want people to frame this as their ""peak"" and use it to bag on them later, but, eh, haters gonna hate anyway so",88,76,False,self,,,,,

So, I'm not sure if this has been generally addressed before, but has anyone ever noticed that the boys are usually in a particular order when taking pictures at, let's say, award shows and other events that involve red carpets?

It seems to always be Tae, Yoongi, Jin, Kookie, Rapmon, Jimin, and J-Hope.

I searched [""BTS red carpet""](https://www.google.com/search?q=bts+red+carpet&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS600US600&amp;hl=en-US&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2kt6Qvo_UAhVl7IMKHZPGAVcQ_AUICSgB&amp;biw=320&amp;bih=492&amp;dpr=2) and they are literally always in that order, even when a member is absent!

Have you guys realized that they do this? I'm probably really late in the game for noticing lol

I was planning on making a unique storyline for whichever character  (BTS member) you play as.



I would make each member have unique attacks based on fandom jokes.
For instance, I was thinking about labeling the psychic stat as ""JAMS"" and of course giving Jimin 0% psychic ability.

I posted this on the Discord but someone suggested I post it here, so here's my fan account of the Sydney concert to the best of my memory. Hopefully the formatting looks alright, otherwise sorry for the wall of text. I'm also fairly hyung line biased so my recount focuses a little more on the older members.. sorry :(


&gt;the members themselves

first of all - for reference i was about 2 meters from the front stage, about 1m from one of the arms of the Y stage, so I was fairly close and got to see all their faces close up. thoughts in general is that they are all better looking and considerably more tan irl. whether that's due to whitewashing or stage lights? you tell me.


***jin*** - mr worldwide handsome is right. jin shocked me with how much more beautiful he was when i finally saw him up close - he looks quite soft and handsome in photos but he does not look soft irl - his face is very mature and defined and he looks breathtaking. he smiled a lot and was an absolute fucking dork. him and jungkook in particular were teasing each other a lot. at one point he rolled up his sleeves to show two heart bracelets he had on his wrists and all the other members laughed at him. he also told a joke and then laughed at it at one point. jin looked like he was born to be on the stage, he was absolutely drinking it in, waving to crowd heaps, laughing and smiling and blowing kisses. jins voice also sounds amazing live. he sounds on par, if not better than the studio tracks and it absolutely blew me away, especially during awake.
 
***yoongi*** - much much more tan irl. his skin is a very soft warm gold-brown, almost like honey. his eyes are very thin and hes super good looking, though a bit serious seeming. he seemed to stick to one side of the stage during certain songs, so we had a lot of time with him. his stage presence was really something as well - he might be small but he absolutely owns the stage. his voice sounded different when he was singing too? not sure what was up with that but it was interesting. i was really surprised with how i found him on stage - he looks different for sure but i cant put my finger on it. they certainly make him look younger a lot of the time in photos and such anyway, he looks much closer to his age on stage and it suits his features i think. he had a very serious face a lot of the time while singing but he still looked absolutely beautiful.

***hoseok*** - i will try not to gush here because i am still so fucking shook over hoseok, but - he was made to be here, on stage in front of people. he was absolutely drinking it in every second, glowing with the energy of everyone and just demanding attention. even when he walked to the other side of the stage i would miss people on our side because i was just staring at him. also, everything they say about him is true - pictures do not do him justice. all of his features are amplified 100x irl, his face is so fucking beautiful, he looks like a marble statue or some kind of work of art. he has soft very sharp eyes and all of his face is very narrow and high. his smile makes his cheeks rosy and his eyes twinkle and his heart shaped mouth is so fucking cute. when he dances he always has this grin on his face and its the most beautiful thing to see because you can just tell he absolutely loves being there. seriously, seeing how much he was enjoying himself made me want to cry. i screamed oh my god so many times at basically him just existing. i am legitimately so fucking in love with him after the concert and honestly cannot see myself changing biases.

***namjoon*** - one word: handsome. namjoon is soooo handsome. he has a beautiful big round face with those gorgeous eyes and his everything just lights up when he smiles, which is very often. he spent a lot of time talking to the crowd and walking around everywhere. he was really really sweet in general. his rap is sooo powerful too, that beautiful low voice and the way he basically commands the stage when hes rapping. namjoon was probably the member after hoseok that demanded you look at him when he performed the most. he kept telling us to jump during run and outro, and hyped up the crowd a lot. he sweat like crazy and was basically shiny as a glazed donut after the first song, bless him. also, like every other member, he is way darker irl, his skin is pretty brown, as opposed to yoongi, hoseok and tae who are more gold.

(i didnt focus as much on the maknae line, so sorry! my bias is showing)


***jimin*** - looks small irl. so fucking cute, but super intimidating when he isnt grinning. he has a very serious resting face, but he was mostly smiley when he was walking around, thought the serious face came out a lot when he was dancing. he did a lot of silly dances during the medley and teased kookie a lot. also his voice has a different sound live which i really liked, i cant really put my finger on it but the tone is a lot stronger than it is in the studio


***tae*** - taehyung is such a fucking sweetie. he shot so many finger hearts at the crowd and kept pulling peace signs and grinning. he pushed his hair back heaps and waved a lot. id say about 50% of the people i met were tae stans, which really surprised me, he was suuuuper popular at least with the people in the pit, which meant everyone went crazy for him. his face has the same otherwordly beauty to it irl and his skin is so soft looking, a very gentle dark golden colour. tae is seriously so fucking ridiculously handsome, i have some very strong memories of him walking past us and me just thinking - jesus christ how is he even real.

***jungkook*** - kookie is an absolute brat. everyone kept ruffling his hair and he was teasing all the other members. he grinned heaps whenever he wasnt performing and it was so nice to see - his smile is either really cheeky or really angelic depending how you look at it. him and jimin both have smiles that make you want to take care of them and i can see why all the other members do baby them so much. kookie was probably the subject of the most member/member interactions, apart from when everyone wanted to see jins heart wristbands (this dork).


&gt;Songs     

***Not today*** - Couldnt see anything. Was at the back. Had to watch the big screen. Super fucking hype, hadnt really hit me that they were there and real yet. The fanchants for this song are unreal, its the perfect opener. Me and all the girls next to me were basically losing our fucking minds that they were RIGHT THERE.
 
***Introduction*** - cute english from everyone! Seriously they were speaking so much english and though i could barely hear any of it thanks to screams i felt my heart fucking melt when they talked.
 
***Am I Wrong*** - the choreo for this is so cool! I couldnt see much of it but it was such a fucking fun song. Most of my recollection of the first few songs is kinda hazy due to being far back in the crowd at this point.
 
***Baepsae*** - At this point I was slowly weaving my way through to the front of the crowd. There was a different person beside me every single song so theres gotta be a lot of girls out there who remember a random dude screaming about Hoseok beside them. sorry, lol. I could barely see the screens thanks to peoples phones. BUT I did see Hoseoks hip thrusts and I screamed at both of them. He did one with his hand on his crotch and one handless and I wanted to fucking die. Also Baepsae is amazing live, Im so glad they kept it in the setlist.
 
***Dope*** - this was AWESOME live. I didnt see BTS themselves much because of peoples fucking phones blocking the big screens but the crowd went absolutely insane for dope.

***Begin*** - there was a girl in front of me with a fucking iPad who was about 45 - i had no idea what she was doing in the fucking pit but there you go. Barely saw any of this performance. Jungkooks jacket is super fucking pretty though, Im gonna have to go back and save pictures cause he looked so good during this.


***Lie*** - Another performance stuck behind iPad girl. Im soooo fucking angry I barely saw this because it was by far one of the stages I was looking forward to. Jimin sounded fucking great and I saw the part where he dances with the blindfold on so at least that was nice.
 
***Lost*** - this was the first performance on the front stage and the crowd went nuts. I was able to move up quite a few rows because everyone was following them around and it made it easy to slip forward. I love this song but I really only saw Tae and Jimin due to - you guessed it, fucking idiots with their phones up. I got away from iPad girl though, so yay.
 
***Save me*** - my first time seeing the rapline up close. oh my god. i can barely remember this song because i was just trying to take in their faces. hoseok didnt come near our side much so i got to save my shock at him for later but namjoon and yoongi looked sooo good. even though it's fairly chill this song is an absolute banger live, i really really loved it. the choreo is so crazy to actually see in front of my face.
 
***I Need U*** - I dont remember much of this. It was on the front stage and the girl in front of me kept looking back at me while I was singing - maybe I was out of tune lol
 
***First Love*** - i was told he did this stage different to normal? irregardless i really really loved first love - the set itself was really really nice and yoongi was just incredible, he has so much stage presence and he sounded absolutely so passionate, as well as his outfit being beautiful.



***Reflection*** - *we love you!* namjoon actually changed the lyrics at the end to i wish you could love yourselves (i think?). this stage is eerie with the soft music and his low voice and i remember the crowd being fairly quiet for it - it was really really atmospheric. namjoon standing alone high up on the stage with a single spotlight as well.. reflection felt very weird amongst all the noise. i found some NZ ARMY at this point after pushing through as far as i could and ended up on the far right side of the stage near the front.
 
***Stigma*** - I couldnt hear any of Taes high notes during this due to the fucking crowd screaming their lungs out every time he hit one. so annoying. the stage itself, however is beautiful and tae is beautiful. i love how it starts with him rising out of the phone booth namjoon leaves the stage through.
 
***Mama*** - this was the only song I cried during. Hoseok was glowing the entire night but during Mama he just lit up the stage like some kind of celestial creature made of pure light and stars. Mama was the only stage I had watched before and it was a million times better live.. during the 2nd half Hoseok did a lot of vocal ad libs and i think I was legitimately screaming the whole time. Up on the front stage he looked absolutely amazing, dancing around with the most beautiful smile on his face. Seriously, I cant put into words at how much he seemed like the only light in the room during this song - he was the most incredibly beautiful thing Ive ever seen in my life, both physically and metaphysically. ive always said this song sounds so very very him and everything about it just oozes with his personality, his charisma and his absolute passion and love. This stage was an absolute treat and Im so glad I got to see his smile up close.


***Awake*** - Jins solo was instantly my 2nd favourite on Wings from first listen and did absolutely not disappoint. The rising stage made it very easy to see him and his live notes were incredible - his voice is exactly the same as it is on the album. The crowd was gorgeous with their singing during this song too, as was the strings that were playing along with Jin.
 
***Cypher 4*** - holy. shit. as a giant fucking ball of rap line trash this stage was.. holy fucking shit. Rap line were so fucking incredible. Hoseok spent most of his time on the left side of the stage, sadly, but Yoongi and Namjoon were on our side a lot and each of them sauntered around when they werent singing. this stage so so fucking high energy and hoseok kept playing around with his shades until he took them off with the most shit eating grin on his face. the crowd went fucking insane during cypher, too, which was incredible, literally the entire arena was buzzing with the vibes of the song. this was my favourite stage by far, i wish i could relive it over and over.
 
***Fire*** - the crowd went insane for fire. The entire stadium was literally roaring all the lyrics. This was another song that was really more about the audience than bts, even if they were still on the front stage and literally right there.


***Highlight medley*** - this was when they really started moving around the front stage a lot, interacting with the crowd and being goofs. 


1.  **N.O** - i dont remember this but apparently it did happen. To be honest a lot of the highlight medley blurs into one for me.
2. **No More Dream** - Jin spent almost the entire song hanging around our side of the stage and I made eye contact with him a bunch of times. He always looked so cheery! Jimin spent most of the time dancing around in the middle with a big smile on his face, it was super fucking cute. Also when they all stood in a line formation jimin was messing with jungkooks hair and giggling at him and jungkook turned to face him and laugh with him.
3. **Boy in Luv** - I was standing next to a Tae stan during this one and Im pretty sure I heard her soul leave her body, lol. This song is so choreo based they mostly didnt wander around but it was another big hit with the crowd and its such a fun song.
4. **Danger** - i dont remember this either.. Welp. i think tae walked around near our side at this point and I sorta just went :v_ded:. Hes seriously so handsome.
5. **Run** - I was baptised by the holy father Min Yoongi during Run, which is also coincidentally one of my favourite title tracks. Basically my entire face got soaked in water when he sprayed our section. Yoongi hung out on our side of the stage a lot and looked fucking stunning. Namjoon also was yelling at the crowd to jump a lot during run and hyping us up heaps.


***21st century girl*** - another one where the crowd went crazy. I enjoyed this song so much, the lyrics are so great to yell out. Funnily enough it was also one of my least favourites on Wings, along with Cypher 4 but now after seeing them live they were two of my favourite stages.
 
***Talk*** - this was when i made eye contact with hoseok - his resting face is sort of sultry looking and since he was above me he was looking down so it looked even more sultry and i legit fucking screamed and clutched my friends shoulder. i can still remember my stomach dropping when our eyes made contact.. jesus christ. also, at this point yoongi was absolutely saturated in sweat. it almost looked like a god damn wet t-shirt contest, if he wasn't wearing an undershirt you'd be able to see everything. the entire top part of his shirt was seethrough
 
***Boy meets evil*** - I swear Hoseok has no fucking bones in his body. Everyone screamed when he did the high kick of his leg  - it was crazy watching him dance this live and i fucking love him so much
 
***Blood sweat and tears*** - This was on the back stage and I barely remember any of it. Im sort of disappointed because i was really looking forward to seeing it, but i legit can hardly remember of the song or anything that happened.
 
**encore** - the entire encore in general was really really good, since it featured 3 of my favourite songs. it was very uplifting but also ultimately bittersweet, as we knew the concert was going to end soon.


***outro: wings*** - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Outro is one of my favourite tracks on Wings and this song was MADE for arenas. there was enough space during this that me and all my friends were jumping up and down during the chorus, which is what should be god damn happeningt. Hoseok was fucking cheeky during the bridge, messing with the crowd and getting them to sing all while grinning like an angel.
 
***Ment*** - The one advantage of pushed so fucking far to the right - Hoseok stands on the far right. Having him so close had me ridiculously shook - I actually dont remember much of the ment because of it, because I was so blown away by how beautiful he was. 
 
***2! 3!*** - I thought this would be the song that would make me cry, but i guess i probably sweat all my tears out at this point. 2! 3! was absolutely fucking beautiful and im so glad i learned the lyrics. this is the kind of song made a thousand times better by having other people to sing along with you, and hearing it with the live band, and then at the end when they cut the music and it was just us singing and vocal line doing their ad libs gave me goosebumps.

***Spring Day*** - this and not today had the loudest singing by far, i guess because the lyrics are easy and repetitive. this was also the song that made me feel the happiest to be there. the woah-oh continued for so long and there was just one point where i turned away and looked at the stands behind us just to take it all in. i smiled so fucking much during spring day, i was so incredibly happy to be there. if 2! 3! was bts singing to us, then spring day was us singing to them. the part especially after the bridge (jimins maybe its cherry blossoms) especially was so fucking beautiful - i could barely hear bts singing because of how loud the crowd was. in fact, i could barely hear any of the song due to how loud everyone was singing.
 
***Ending*** - everyone ran around the stage heaps, waved at every section, was generally cheery and smiley as fuck. The woah-oh-oh, continued all through this part, which was absolutely beautiful. There was a real feeling of togetherness that we were all there singing together for BTS and it was one of my favourite moments - the crowd was what really brings the show all together.

Thanks for reading! If anyone else was in centre GA and saw a guy screaming 'HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL' every time Hoseok did something, you probably met me!",30,84,False,self,,,,,

**A bit of backstory incoming. Feel free to skip**

When I was in 8th grade, I joined my school choir. We did a bit of choreography here and there but it was never really anything special. But That was what introduced me to dance, and performance in general. 

Fast forward to 10th grade. Because 9th graders weren't allowed in my high schools audition performance choir. I audition. The audition consisted of a couple easy dance moves, a 10 second freestyle, and to sing the national anthem. I live in the US and our national anthem is a really wide-ranged song so it's pretty difficult to sing. I pass the audition and make it into the choir. For 10th and 11th grade, we had one director that never really did a whole lot with us. Normally show choirs like mine go out to competitions and such, but for the first couple years of my experience, that didn't happen. 

My senior year comes along, and my choir allows 9th grade into the choir because we have a new director. She was my favorite teacher I've ever had. And made all of us realize what we were *truly* capable of. We sang our hearts out, all 24 of us, and we danced our asses off day after day after day. This is high school and choir was first class, so we were doing these practices at about 7:30am until around 8:30 every single day. We went to 3 competitions that year, placed 3rd in one, and won first place (which was an extreme slap in the face to certain members of my school's administration) at the other. We worked so hard that year, and then I graduated high school. Unfortunately I hadn't danced much, if at all, since. I play in a band and show off a move or two during our concerts but that's about it. 

**Back story is over. This is the part I really wanted to share with you all**

I discovered K-Pop after my cousin took a trip to SK for school. He came back and introduced me to two groups: MONSTA X and BLACKPINK. I actually found BTS on my own because they were recommended to me via music videos related to MONSTA X on YouTube. 

I watched ""Fire"" and  it was the first song I heard of BTS. I was BLOWN AWAY by the choreography and checked their other videos like ""Dope"", ""Boy In Luv"", and ""Run"". Amazed at each one. 

I've been watching all of their videos for about a year now, but tonight something happened. I impulsively decided that I wanted to learn the dance for ""Fire"". So I looked up the tutorial video from some dance group (can't remember the name and I'm on mobile, sorry :/) and learned the timings and steps one by one for the intro, chorus, and the ending quickstep. I spent about 2-3 hours rewatching that video over and over again to learn it. 

After that time I could proficiently (not perfectly obviously) duplicate those parts. I loved every single second of what happened tonight and it has sparked a fire in me that I haven't had for almost 7 years now: and that is my love for dance. 

So thank you BTS, thank you so much for reigniting the fire within me and making me fall back in love with a passion I once held so dear. ~~

TL;DR: I used to love to dance, stopped after high school, haven't danced since, decided to learn some of the dances for ""Fire"" tonight, and now I love to dance again. ",9,78,False,self,,,,,

It's been an amazing week for both the boys and for us here in the sub. The boys have just been glowing in their interviews and spreading their wings a bit more, while our ""small"" little sub has grown to 9k wow!!

But as awesome as these past few days have been, we want to take the time to remind you guys about the 4th anniversary project. The **submissions deadline** closes this **TUESDAY 30th of MAY at 11:59 pm US CENTRAL** time. You can [review the guidelines here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6b1h5w/4th_anniversary_project_guidelines), if you need to.

Please be timely with your submissions so we can print and ship the book on time.

&amp;nbsp;

As some of you might know, we were planning on pairing a charity to donate to along with sending the fan messages compilation as a gift. We'll be taking donations until the **9th of JUNE (11:59 pm US CENTRAL time)**. All donations will go to the [Korean Suicide Prevention Association](http://suicideprevention.or.kr/m/main/main.php) since youth mental health is an important topic for the boys. Below is a bit more info about them:

&gt;
&gt; *Partnering with the Korean Association for Suicide Prevention (KASP), the Young Health Programme in Korea focused on increasing awareness of mental health and helping prevent young suicide*.
&gt;
&gt;The entire website is in Korean, but there is a bit of information [here](https://www.younghealthprogrammeyhp.com/programmes/korea.html).
&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

As with all our projects, **the coordinators will cover all costs**, so as many of you guys can participate. If you would like to help us cover printing and shipping costs, [you can do so here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Please, [follow these guidelines to contribute]( http://i.imgur.com/XtNznaw.png) and dont forget to **add username / 4th anniversary Project in the comment box**. Any additional money will be contributed as a donation to the above mentioned charity.

&amp;nbsp;

Please keep an eye out on your inbox or PM's as we will be sending out confirmation messages and communicating with you guys about your submission.

Thank you, guys, to all of you who signed up to participate in this project. We hope to see all your lovely submissions soon.

Strong power to all the students dealing with finals and to those of us that have already started the work week.

Also, I've seen the hashtag #BAMA2017DiamondEdition_BTS, which is apparently for the Big Apple Music Awards where BTS are nominated alongside other Kpop acts for Best Asian Artist I think.

This post is just to inform you all of some updates to the sub weve made in the past few months, and to get any feedback you all might have for us more generally.   
 
#1. Rules Page  
 
[Its been updated so its much prettier and more readable now!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) Rather than being a blob of text, its now organized into sections and contains a bolded keyword so its easier to see which rules are for what at a glance.  
 
Weve also added some new rules, most of them are pretty common-sense and we had mostly been operating under them already before adding them here, but we wanted to spell it out for clarity after we realized they were missing.  
 
#2. /r/heungtan room and similar  
 
[When we originally first asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5yv0sp/170311_rbangtan_rules_flair_update_post/) about a sort of weekly humor/meme thread, most people seemed to be in favor of it, and also wanted to keep the memes/shitposts concentrated to one place rather than having them flood the sub in the future (as a preventative measure). However, we have noticed that the thread does not seem to be getting much activity. Therefore we want to know what the community wants in regard to this: keep the thread? Keep it all in /r/bangtan room? Etc. We have received a suggestion by a user that we keep all fanart in a similar kind of weekly thread. We would like to know the subs opinions on this as well.   
 
#3. New mods?  
 
We are currently thinking about adding another mod to the team because of how much this sub has grown (over 2k new subs since we added /u/llaverna and /u/juliancasablancas about 4 months ago, wow). We arent totally decided about how we will do this yet, as we might just look for members of the community we think would work well within the team (because the application process is pretty time consuming and annoying), but we **do** know that we want someone in an Asian/Oceanic timezone as that is the only area not represented on our current mod team.  
 
If we do decide to open applications in the future, we will make a post to announce it then!  
 
#4. New Emojis  
 
/u/Eren_ has added some new emojis to the sub based on the requests of you guys in the last post! You can see the full list of sub emojis and how to use them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/emojis). 
 
#5. Other business  
 
Are there any other suggestions/feedback you have for us regarding the sub? Let us know here!  
 
Have a lovely day!

814,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2017-5-30,2017,5,30,5,6e2mew,self.bangtan,[Throwback] 150324 Rap Monster's Interview with Hiphopplaya,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6e2mew/throwback_150324_rap_monsters_interview_with/,zjuns,1496089250,"**Q: How did working on P.D.D happen?**

**RM:** Through BTS Mnet reality program that was aired last year, I met Warren G for the first time. At that time, Warren G said that he wanted to give us a beat. After discussing how and which album it would be good to be worked on, I ended up releasing my solo single.

**Q: Theres a story that you guys bribed him with money (laughter). If you could clear up the story please.**

**RM:** While filming the program, we got a working offer first from Warren Gs side. Warren G personally said it, and I remember Warren Gs manager really positively proposed it. Truthfully, besides P.D.D, Warren G said that he wished to remix one of BTS tracks and place it on the album. At first, I thought he was just saying these offers. But he said he was serious, and then I realized at that moment that it was real. He said, When you guys go back to Korea, Ill officially talk about it with your company. Maybe it was in order to try out something new. Although, there are probably those who dont want to believe it and will end up not believe it (laughter).

**Q: I heard that you guys first received a few songs.**

**RM:** At first, we received 3 songs. However, the feeling didnt really come to us well. This wasnt the Warren G feeling that I had thought of. I was looking forward to a song like Regulate or This DJ, but it wasnt that kind of song. Thats why I asked for another song to be sent, and I received 3 songs additionally. Among those, P.D.D was a song that I thought was closest to Warren Gs feel.

**Q: P.D.D is definitely a song that has the traditional vibes of west coast hip-hop. Was there a specific reason in adding these kind of lyrics to this kind of sound?**

**RM:** As soon as I heard the song, the words of Please Dont Die naturally came to my mind. I think I unconsciously thought that it would be fun to speak of a slightly brutal story on top of a soft beat.

**Q: When you think of a battle rap, people normally think of very straightforward lyrics. Something like, I will kill all of you! (laughter). However, this song felt somewhat like an indirect speech.**

**RM:** It reflects how I feel lately towards those who hate me and criticize me. I used to find it really upsetting and got very angry a long time ago. However, Ive been able to rise above that a bit more that. I wanted to truthfully add that feeling. This is also the reason behind the lyrics of If you want to come with me even now, then lets go.

**Q: When I see those lyrics at the bridge, I feel that you have more ease than before.**

**RM:** Thats true. Its not made with force, but it really feels like that lately. If theres any person who made personal attacks towards me, but want to come with from now on, then I want them too. Ive gained that much ease. I also feel that I have matured a bit as well.

**Q: For those who dont know the various narrations of battle raps from traditions of west coast hip-hop sounds or the specific hidden beauty of hip-hop, could continue to view this song as boring or nothing great.**

**RM:** I just accept it. I respect the tastes of those people. I dont want to force it upon them or explain it. Although Im thankful to those who understand my intention or feel enjoyment.

**Q: To be honest, P.D.D has some similarities with Regulate if you look at it. Although Regulate received a lot of love from Korea with a gentle sound, its a song that has a meaning on its storytelling aspect as well, and more than anything, if you look at the lyrics for Regulate, its quite brutal and doesnt seem to fit with the sound.**

**RM:** Thats true. I received a lot of influence from Regulate without knowing it. To be honest, when I first heard Regulate, I thought it was a bit weird (laughter). The sound is good, but why are the lyrics like this?, Why does he talk about getting robbed so gently like this? is what I thought.

**Q: Do you normally enjoy writing lyrics to battle raps like these? Even if youre not specifically attacking anyone.**

**RM:** Thats it. I enjoy writing it. And I also think that you dont need to specifically attack something.

**Q: What do you mean exactly when you say that you dont necessarily have to attack any one?**

**RM:** Im not the type that enjoys attacking. Even if I were to attack, Im not the type to attack with an immense amount of aggression. However, Im the type that has to say everything I want to say. No matter what the nuance may be, should I say that it should be resolved through music. Although someone may think if you were going to attack someone, you should have done it properly after listening to P.D.D, but this is my tendency and method.

**Q: From the perspective of the listener, there was one place that was quite amusing. The phrase of ride wit me comes out repetitively during the bridge, and of course, I understand that its a symbolic expression to say Come with me. However, when you listen to west coast hip-hop music a lot, dont they normally use very direct expressions rather than the expression of ride wit me? Something like, ride my car and ride towards the seaside of Long Beach (laughter). Should I call that driving music. While listening to the song, things like this strangely overlapped.**

**RM:** To be honestly, while writing the lyrics, I really wanted to include the expression of ride. The west coast hip-hop music videos that I normally had watched a lot started coming to mind, and I thought that it was a word that fit well with the west coast hip-hop vibe that the sound had. I thought that it would be good if people accepted these lyrics as a medium.

**Q: I heard that you received a lot of mentoring from Warren G.**

**RM:** I wanted to ask Warren G a lot about hip-hop. Like Warren G stated, things like shooting guns, doing drugs, robbery arent things that are hip-hop itself, but a negative side thats included within hip-hop. Its like an uninvited guest that shoved its way into hip-hop, but people said that thats hip-hop. He also told me that hip-hop is something thats open to everyone despite what race you may be or what language you may speak. I heard a lot of great things from him besides those as well. Although it may seem like a very obvious thing, but the weight of it just felt different when Warren G said it. And after everything he would say, Warren G attached Its all Good. When I heard those words from the side, then my mood felt really good. Should I compare it to the feeling of a grandfather telling good stories next to you (laughter).

**Q: If you were to grade Warren G when he wears glasses vs when he takes them off.**

**RM:** Since time has passed, I think its much better when he wears glasses. Long ago, he was really very good-looking If you look at pictures or music videos from then.

**Q: Then Ill just wrap that up as that he looked better long ago without glasses, but looks better now with glasses. Is there anything more you have to say about P.D.D?**

**RM:** Erm. Putting everything aside, it was really just a very fortunate event to be able to rap to Warren Gs beat. Although someone may try to cut me down for this or that reason, Im proud and it was a good experience.

**Q: Lets talk about your mixtape, [RM]. If you can give us the concept of this mixtape?**

**RM:** If you look at the album cover, my face is divided in black and white. I wanted to show that I was two-faced. Im positive at some times and then negative at other times. I speak of hopes at some points and then forget about it later. You can just see it as something I made by pulling out the various rooms inside myself. I wanted to express the thought of, Theres this many sides inside of me, but in the end, this is me, and you whos listening to this is just you too. I normally enjoyed India Aries Just Do You. Its a song that gave a lot of comfort to me when I felt confused. I believe that the message of this song gave a lot of influence towards this mixtape. Thats why the song that represents the entire message for this mixtape is Do You.

**Q: This is a solo, not a group and its a mixtape, not an album. Was there any specific structure you had in working on it?**

**RM:** I tried to work on it as comfortably as I could. I tried not to have many thoughts on it. Even if there were lyrics that could start a controversy, I just went with it if it wasnt too harsh. A BTS album is something thats not just my own, and it needs to fit the groups concept, which is why there are many things to think about, but since this mixtape is mine, I tried to self-examine the closest to my true self and work on it comfortably.

**Q: The curses and aggressive expressions stand out.**

**RM:** Honestly, Im not someone who enjoys cursing. However, I believed that there was an emotion that could only be released through shit or fuck. So I used words like those in places that were necessary. Its not like it was a piece of work that had to go under deliberation.

**Q: How did you pick the placing for the mixtape tracks?**

**RM:** First off, after I picked the order, I discussed it with my company. For example, when I made the 1st track, Voice, I thought that it should be the first track since I had made it. This song is the only song that talks about my past story since I was young till now. Its also a song I made after receiving influence from seeing foreign rappers rap over a piano sound. After that, Do You, which has the main message of the mixtape, came out and I wanted to talk more affirmatively about what I wanted to say through Awakening. After that, Monster, Throw Away, God Rap came out, and in these songs, I just wanted to rap. I made it while thinking about rap songs that are good to listen to and hmm that made my heart beat.

**Q: Are you talking about the auditory pleasure that can only be given through raps and not singing.**

**RM:** Thats right. Thats it. I couldnt express it well (laughter). And for the last song, I put in I Believe. The reason why I thought I had to put this song as the last one is because no matter how the process was before, I end up believing in myself. I wanted to wrap it up.

**Q: Without even listening to your explanation, Voice really sounds like the first track, and I Believe really fits the last position. Was there a song that was omitted during the working process?**

**RM:** Its a song called Dreams. Its a song that I made around 2 years ago, but I felt like it didnt really fit with the mixtape concept, so I didnt put it in. Although there were a few songs that were of the melodramatic category, I felt like it was random, so I didnt put it in. Ah, there was also a song that had to do with money, but I didnt put it in because I havent earned a large sum of money yet, and Ive never really had desperate worries over money before, so I felt that I wouldnt be able to grasp the thoughts of people. To be honest, when I was writing the lyrics to this song, there were times I was a bit stuck or confused in the middle, but I think its because I still dont have enough worries or that I dont have enough years of experience stack up yet.

**Q: So do you think that it ended up doing well after filtering out those songs?**

**RM:** Although I was really absorbed in it when making them I believe that it worked out well in the end. Even though I was sad about it at first, I see it that a refined and more concentrated mixtape came out. And I can use those songs later anyways.

**Q: Is there a message that you wish those who are listening to it wouldnt miss?**

**RM:** You Do You, I Do I is the catch phrase for this mixtape. What I want to say is that, You do what you have to do, and Ill do what I have to. But Im like this. The thought of, Youre you, and Im me is the largest thing thats been taking control of me lately.

**Q: There are a few songs that focused on rap techniques. For example, Joke is like that. Could you talk about this song?**

**RM:** 'Joke is a song whose lyrics were written with a stream of consciousness. Thats why the title is called 'Joke as well. Theres nothing hidden behind the lyrics. Its 500% for the auditory pleasure of rap songs. Since the other songs have messages or emotions placed into them, I felt that it was necessary to add in a refreshing song without any thoughts. I put in a lot of what I believe are rap 'skills.

**Q: Whats the reason in choosing 'Run The Jewels as the beat for 'Joke?**

**RM:** I normally enjoy Run The Jewels. There were a few songs I had recorded on the beat for Run The Jewels among the songs that werent placed on the mixtape. I believe that they make beats really well where the El-P is minimal, but is able to emphasize the auditory effect of raps. There were 5 song nominees to be used for 'Joke, but all 5 songs were Run The Jewels beats. I normally thought that if a chance came to me where I could show off my skills, that I would use Run The Jewels beats no matter what.

**Q: I agree with you on your thoughts about the El-P beat. Its a sound that burns a rappers fighting spirit with 'I have to chew and eat this beat (laughter). If you could talk about 'RUSH next, where Krizz Kaliko had participated.**

**RM:** There was a time where we made a dance performance to Krizz Kalikos 'Spaz last year on a year-end awards ceremony. And I dont know how he found out about it, but that video came up on Krizz Kalikos Twitter. He said, Look at these guys. They danced to my song, but its really cool. I normally enjoy Krizz Kalikos songs, so after seeing that, I sent a message to Krizz Kaliko. I asked about working together via DM, but he answered so coolly that we should work together. So I sent him a few beats, but Krizz Kaliko picked out the one that I personally liked the most. I thought that as expected, he has good ears (laughter). In the end, he worked really hard. He first asked, Want me to do the chorus too?, and I dont know how he knew, but he placed the word 'oppa inside the lyrics before sending it to us. He probably knew it from 'Gangnam Style. And he also left one space blank during the chorus and gave the suggestion of, Wouldnt it be fun if you added in Korean during this part? And for the mix, he replied, Im currently on tour in Mexico, but the mix isnt really good because its not with the engineer that I normally work with. So, I think it would be good if you guys re-did the mix. Sorry. Even after the work was finished, he proposed, Since I worked on your mixtape this time, lets officially work next time and release a track. The next time I go to America, I really want to meet him once.

**Q: Do you like Krizz Kalikos rap included in 'RUSH?**

**RM:** OF course. I felt that he really genuinely worked on it. I also like the melody as well. The fun thing is, whenever we receive an award at some ceremony, Krizz Kaliko always sends us a congratulations mention (laughter). I think hes slightly cute as well.

**Q: From 'Voice, I could hear the part where you gave an homage to Nas 'One Mic.**

**RM:** I normally enjoy 'One Mic. I like the movie-like development, and silent mood of it. I received a lot of influence from 'One Mic, and used a small portion of the lyrics from the clean version of 'One Mic. Its respect in my own way.

**Q: After hearing your reply, I remember. There was recently a screening of a documentary release. What did you feel?**

**RM**: I learned a lot of things that I didnt know. The interview with Nas younger sibling, Jungle, was especially interesting. I was looking forward to a lot of stories on Bravehearts, but it didnt come out. Truthfully, although I did feel something from the movie itself, theres a lot I learned from just the screening itself as well. Our nation is able to do something like this, and even when they do this, people come too A proudness like that.

**Q: In 'Voice, theres a line that goes, I admit to it, my dark past.**

**RM:** Just like how it says, its my dark past. Something that can be summarized with Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar.

**Q: If you say Kendrick Lamar, then are you talking about your 'School of Tears where you covered over his song, 'Swimming Pools?**

**RM:** Thats right.

**Q: But isnt that song just a 'cover like you say? Using the original songs flow over the songs beat and rapping is something that can be seen often on a hip-hop mixtape or a released song.**

**RM:** Although I did film the music video for 'School of Tears, it was a cover song where I revealed what the original song was before releasing it. So it was just a successor, but it got criticized a lot, saying that it was plagiarism. To be honest, if plagiarism was the goal, who would do it like that. Also, because it was a cover song, there are many parts where I did the exact same flow as Kendrick Lamar on purpose, so that I could learn his flow. However, there were a lot of negative comments like, This is a nations disgrace, Dont you even have the guts as a rapper.

**Q: When I see it, that doesnt make sense. If anything, it just sounds like attacks that started from ignorance. Dont make it your dark past, lets make it your bright past. Now, what do you mean with Kanye West?**

**RM:** During the choreography practice for BTS comeback, we matched it to Kanye Wests 'Black Skinhead. Now that I look back on it, I think it may have been a bit too ignorant by the company. Because we couldnt just use 'Black Skinhead on broadcast. Anyways, our choreography teacher is amazingly skilled, so he had perfectly set up the choreography to fit with 'Black Skinhead. So we were fretting over how to change it before our comeback stage. But after changing it numerous times, the dance completely died. So in the end, we had to make a new song that was similar to 'Black Skinhead and do our comeback stage. If I had to make an excuse, this song wasnt added to the album, and it wasnt used for business purposes. It was simply used for our stage performance. Like a BGM. However, I believe that people could definitely criticize this. No matter what the situation or process was, the results ended up like that.

**Q: I think if you wanted to see this as a dark past, it could definitely be seen as that. Although it would be thankful if people understood this process, theres no possibility for that. Now, lets talk about 'God Rap.**

**RM:** 'God Rap undoubtedly received a lot of influence from Nas as well. Should I call it the hidden beauty of Nas? I thought of Nas vibe a lot while making it. To be honest, I thought a lot when I was trying to give it a title. Because theres already Eminems 'Rap God. However, 'God Rap isnt something where Im shouting out that Im the god of rap. The story is completely different. It talks about how there is no god in the world, and that the only gods are ourselves. Its the thought that the only thing that picks my fate is my own self.

**Q: Do you not have a religion?**
**RM:** No, I dont.

**Q: Are you Atheist?**
**RM:** Yes.

**Q: For things that talk about religious or are related to gods remind me of Joey Bada$$s 'Christ Conscious. Did you happen to make a reference to that? **

**RM:** Ah, I didnt refer to that song. If anything, like I previously said, I received influence from Nas. However, now that I listen to it, it seems like theres a connection (laughter). I did normally listen to 'Christ Conscious a lot too.

**Q: Now lets talk about controversies and issues. 'No More Dream, which is your debut song that talked about the realities of education, received a lot of criticism, saying that it was 'clearly a business method since H.O.T days of idol groups that are worn and can be seen through. **

**RM:** For this problem, theres already a solution within me. My thoughts is that people in their 10s are the same now as they were back then. They continue to not have dreams, dont want to study, and have no idea what it is that they want to do. They just want to become a civil servant or make a lot of money. I believe that its the same now as it was when 'Warriors Descending came out. Thats why were just trying to plainly express the reality of now. A student that just studies hard even though they dont have a dream is exactly who I was. Its not something I was trying to pull out old stories for, but something that was purely my own story.

**Q: I saw that you studied well during your school days.**

**RM:** I felt like I had to do something. I believed in the words that, If you dont study now, then youre unable to succeed later on. Thats why I studied really hard. The only thing I enjoyed from studying was the sense of achievement and superiority. I didnt like studying itself. To be honest, when I wrote the lyrics for 'No More Dream, I received multiple rejections from Bang Sihyuk CEO. I wrote about money and a lot of other toics, but he said that it didnt seem like our true stories. After going back and back again, I ended up being able to write what I truly felt.

**Q: It makes me have this thought. There can definitely be criticisms towards 'No More Dream from the historical viewpoint of idols or from the flow of the music industry. Since no one needs to know the reason or meaning for the creation. However, if thats really your own personal story, I think theres a hip-hop side to that from the context of it being 'real.**

**RM:** Although I believe that I can receive criticism, I dont have any embarrassment towards the lyrics for that song. It was really my story.

**Q: You shouted, Westside Till I Die during 'If I Ruled The World.**

**RM:** Thats well. I was really wrong then (laughter). After the album came out and I listened to it, I thought Ah. I think I was immersed in the emotions while recording and ended up shouting like that.

**Q: Whats the specific reason why you feel you were wrong?**

**RM:** First off, I didnt even live in the 'west side And even if that song had a G-Funk sound, what I shouted wasnt the way to respect the west coast hip-hop musicians. I believe there are many meanings inside the words Westside Till I Die. Sweat, struggles, pride, etc. Isnt it a phrase that compressed all these factors of life.

**Q: Are you saying that you overlooked the weight and complex undertones that the phrase has within hip-hop?**

**RM:** Thats right. I believe its different from words like Yo! or Check It!. As a result, I was thoughtless.

**Q: Are you admitting it to be a mistake?**

**RM:** Further than a mistake, it was a wrong. I have nothing to say.

**Q: Then lets talk about the battle(?) with Bobby. What started it?**

**RM:** Bobby made references to me a few times on Show Me The Money. He seemed to enjoy using words like sangnamja (T/N: true man, also the title for Boy in Luv) and leading a fast life (T/N: pronounced as Bangtang). Saying Like a true man, I lead a fast life isnt a common mix of words, right? I thought that it wasnt just a coincidence. He not only attacked Bangtan, but Boyfriend as well. It was the context of, Everything you guys messed up, Ill show it all here. However, I didnt even have much thoughts on it at that point either. I just thought, Bobby probably just dislikes us. However, on his lyrics for Come Here, there were lyrics that seemed to be targeting us again. I live a fast life, theres no need for pretty boys / They call me a monster, I never called myself that / You guys like a full-length mirror much better than a basement dungeon / If my skills were looks, then I would look like Wonbin in front of a bulletproof mirror. But to be honest, Bobby isnt really a Wonbin (laughter)

**Q: Then is he Hyunbin?**

**RM:** Anyways, these lyrics were the third time. I felt like I would be an idiot if I just endured it till the third time. If I didnt give feedback in any way, then it would also be insulting to fans, and I personally couldnt let it pass as well. Truthfully, I was planning to use lyrics from my [RM] mixtape on the MAMA stage. However, after listening to Come Here, I quickly changed the lyrics to reply to Bobby. And then as people caught onto those lyrics, it ended up becoming a hot topic. However, I personally respect Bobby. He does really well on stage. Although I dont think his raps are exceptional or that he has a wide spectrum, his ability to dominate the stage is good, and he has a cool style of hip-hop that rappers arent able to achieve. And the fact that he won SMTM whether or not he had his companys power or not is definitely something that confirmed himself.

**Q: It became a topic whether it was a diss round or battle.**

**RM:** I think it became an even larger topic, because both Bobby and I are in the category of idols. I also felt like they were putting us together to fight (laughter). However, it wasnt to that point.

**Q: I heard you guys greeted each other behind MAMA.**

**RM:** After the performance ended, I went down but Bobby high-fived me from behind the stage. He said that he mouthed my lyrics and saw it well. I found out that when I was performing on stage, Bobby was watching me attentively.

**Q: If you push and see that situation, I feel like Bobbys mind is very hip-hop. Doesnt it seem like he realizes that its both a competitor and game that forms within music?**

**RM: Thats exactly it. Thats exactly what I want to say, but people dont understand it well. Our fans are worried that well end up fighting like this (laughter). However, I hope that they realize that its not like that.**

**Q:** Pushing aside whos good or bad or whose side youre on or not, I think its just nice to see. I feel like you guys would give synergy to each other too.

**RM:** Thats true. Wasnt Swings 'control crisis also a way to pull up all the levels of everyone through competing musically. However, because Bobby and I are both under the category of idols, I think it became a larger controversy. I hope that many people are able to realize that within hip-hop, this is a way to express yourself and that its natural.

**Q: You did the MAMA stage with Zico. Did Zico give you this or that kind of advice?**

**RM:** I knew Zico hyung ever since I was a young child. I believe that hyungs actions in general show me a lot. It gives me help, but also stimulates me.

**Q: So is it like a relationship like Seo Janghoon and Hyun Jooyeop?**

**RM:** That I dont really know about.

**Q: Before you went on stage for MAMA, what did you guys talk about?**

**RM:** Truthfully, I wrote out the lyrics that I would do at MAMA 4~5 days in advance. After I said that, Zico hyung told me that its dangerous to write lyrics quickly like that and that I should be carefully. Saying that he made a really big mistake one time before (laughter).

**Q: What does idol group promotions mean to Rap Monster. A good step in order to reach my goal? Something thats actually my goal? Or just something you ended up finding yourself doing?**

**RM:** Although Im not trying to be discourteous towards our fans or the group itself, I think the closest definition would be something that I just found myself doing. To be honest, my goal is very clear. Its to have many people listen to my music. I want to confirm my existence even more by standing on a large stage. Honestly, I wnated to continue just studying prior to my debut. However, the thing that brought me back to music again was this company and this group. Thats why I dont want to say idol group promotions are a step towards my goal. This is because theres just so much Im receiving from these promotions.

**Q: Are you saying that at first, you just wanted to do music and just wanted to rap?**

**RM:** Thats right. However, when I was about to just concentrate on my studies, I received a call from Untouchables Sleepy hyung, and I ended up auditioning to this company through him. At first, BTS wasnt within this kind of format. It was in the format of YGs 1TYM, where we wouldnt dance. Thats why I went into this group. Because they said that I would be able to rap in such a large company like this. And at that period, I also was rejected from an audition for Big Deal Records, so I was desperate. I thought that I had to do this no matter what. It was the perfect company to work out my dream in wanting to confirm my existence towards more people. However, as the groups format switched to an idol group, I had a lot of confusion. I also felt really hopeless. However, I ended up somehow accepting it And have come up to here.

**Q: The fact that you didnt reject it could also be seen as a 'passive choice, right?**

**RM:** Thats right. I just I think it was just fate to be lke this (laughter). Honestly, I really hated dancing at first. Because Im not good at it. I still Dont like dancing. However, the reason why I keep staying in this company is that they said they would allow me to do my music with my lyrics and my rap, and its slowly becoming a reality. Its like that for BTS album and in my solo works too. For example, the [RM] mixtape is really no different from just myself. I believe that the company is keeping its promise with me. I liked hip-hop, wanted to do rap, and wanted to stand on a large stage. As those three interlinked, I came up to here. If you look at it in another angle its something that I chose.

**Q: However, this is a world that clearly divides hip-hop between real and fake, and has a compulsion towards its purity. Criticisms will continue to exist.**

**RM:** I completely understand. Sometimes I have that kind of critical mind to myself as well. This is because there are times where I have to do things that I dont wish to. When I see other rappers lyrics of I dont do what I dont like to do, I feel like its really cool and theres also an envious side to me about it. Like I said before, I understand that people have a critical mind towards my position. And receive a lot of confusion too. However, because I believe that I know about that aspect of hip-hop better than any one else, Im trying my best in order to be the most real I can in this situation. And more than anything, I want to just have the largest amount of people possible listening to my music. This is the biggest thing to me.

**Q: The standards for 'many people could differ for each person.**

**RM:** Thats right. However, if someone were to ask me if I could just have my music be played for many people no matter what method or way is used, I would reply that that is not the case.

**Q: As a result, 'many people is your standard, and the things youve chosen and set compromises on through your life till now is because it doesnt violate your own standards or values. However, your standards will probably remain unmatched with others.**

**RM:** I understand those people too. I believe they can definitely be like that. However, I believe that the only thing that remains in the end is my music.

**Q: Is there a criticism you agree with that relates to idol group promotions?**

**RM:** There are many. Why do you do smoky makeup, why do you try to act pretty on broadcast, etc. For hip-hop where purity is important and masculinity plays a large part, I believe its definitely a critique that could come out. So from some point, my self-conscious has been divided in half. The reason why the cover for my [RM] mixtape is divided in black and white is to show my two-faced self. I believe that theres no improvement if you have an inferiority complex and victim mentality. I decided upon the thought that I can only find myself once I can admit to myself and approve that both sides are sides of myself.

**Q: However, towards the tradition of hip-hop that sets 'actions as something importance, they could be thinking that youre receiving everything possible through your idol group promotions and then try to act hip-hop by releasing a solo mixtape. Criticisms that thats a contradiction and isnt cool. Even if your mixtapes completion level is high and is well-made.**

**RM:** I understand that thought. You can see it like that. However, I have a lot of greed. The types of music I want to show are on this side and on that side. Conclusively, if Im able to make good music and people continue to look for my music, wont this kind of controversy get better is my thought. Im going to not be wavered by things like that any more. Ive been shook by it too much up till now. When G-Dragon released 'Heart Breaker, I remember it. The reactions to when that was released as opposed to 'One of a Kind is really like heaven and hell. Didnt he do well like that? However, people that dislike G-Dragon still continue to dislike him. Theres nothing you can do about that (laughter).

**Q: If theres something final you want to say?**

**RM:** I hope that youll definitely listen to this mixtape. Just download and click it. Even if its to say bad things about it, I hope that you can listen to it at least once.

One thing I could think of is because the tween/teen market segment is very much open right now in the US. Justin Bieber grew up and 1D disbanded. There's a gap waiting to be filled and for some reason, it is during this timing the youth are discovering BTS.
