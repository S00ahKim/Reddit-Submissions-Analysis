5,2015-7-8,2015,7,8,6,3ch3qg,Selling my tickets to the BTS concert in LA on 7/26,leetaemin,1436304471,"Hi everyone. I have some bad news for me and good news for you: I'm selling 2 tickets to the BTS concert in LA at Club Nokia on Sunday, July 26 at 7 PM. I bought them right when they went on sale in April, but I unfortunately have a conflict that day now and will no longer be able to attend. Since they cost quite a bit, I want to resell them to someone in our small yet great community, but I don't want to jack up the price. Here is the [page to buy tickets.](http://www.axs.com/events/275906/2015-bts-live-trilogy-tickets) As you can see, they're sold out.

[Club Nokia seating chart](http://www.clubnokia.com/venueinfo/seating-chart)

Tickets:

~~1. VIP: this is a general admission, standing room ticket. SubKulture Ent. (the concert promoter) says that some VIP ticketholders will get the chance to do the hi touch event or get BTS tour merch. [Here is the page with the info about the things that VIP ticketholders might win.](http://www.subkultureent.com/tickets/) Tickets were $155 + $21 service fee. I am looking for $180.~~ **SOLD**

~~2. LWBAL3 (Lower Balcony 3), Section A, Seat 307: Tickets were $85 + $16.50 service fee. I am looking for $105.~~ **SOLD**

Please PM me if you are interested. I'll probably just sell them to the first people who PM me. Just so you know, I'll probably be away from my computer for the next 5 hours, so don't worry if I don't immediately respond.",7,3

EDIT: I went looking on craigslist(la county) and there appears to be vip+ tickets for sale at 400. I don't know if it is trustworthy. Not like it matters because the tickets are still too much for what I manged to earn. ",0,1

None of these are my fancams. I tried to find the best quality ones to share for the people that couldn't make the show, so there are a few different filmers.  They're not really in order because I can't remember the exact order, and gave up trying.

Unfortunately, there seem to be no fancams yet of ""Dope"", ""I Need You"", or ""War of Hormone"", but I'll edit if I find any.  IMHO, ""Killer"" was the best song of the show, just in terms of sheer energy.",9,9
