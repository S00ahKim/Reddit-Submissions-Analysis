I know that we probably wont know the exact setlist until the first tour date (25th August 2018), but do you guys have any ideas? They will definitely be performing the songs from their three albums (+ LY Wonder: Prologue), because all of them will be released by then.

I was just wondering if you guys think theyll be performing older songs such as Boy in Luv, N.O and No More Dream. They might not have time, since its only a 2 hour concert. 

I just want to know, because Ive been learning lots of title tracks in preparation.

One Week, One Band is a relatively big blog on tumblr where each week, the blog invites someone credible to write about a band of their choice. This week, they are writing about BTS! Seeing as they have already covered the first half of BTS's career (which you can read [here](http://oneweekoneband.tumblr.com/tagged/bts/chrono) ), this week covers Pt. 2 - now. 

They usually post ~5 times a day and should wrap up this Saturday. The information likely won't be anything new or groundbreaking for hardcore fans, but it's an interesting and unique perspective on multiple different aspects of BTS, and I urge you to at least check it out. ",13,141

What are your favourite moments/ quotes/performances/ SNS content from this short-lived era? 

Few of mine;

1. RUN BTS three-part series  Where do I even begin? It was heartwarming, insightful, fun, tear jerking and highly entertaining. 

2. The recently aired BBMA Bangtan Bomb  Especially, Seokjins iconic statements. 

3. Airplane Pt.2 performance ",1,6

So I was casually browsing on Youtube and I see this youtuber promoting BTS merchandise. He has a discount code too (which I found weird) and on the video he comments saying that its the actual BTS website... I looked up the company and their facebook and they've been in business since May. He sells their album and I wonder if they are making the merchandise themselves and selling it. I tried to go on Bighit website and search for information but there isnt any on this website really. Has any army heard or read news from Bighit regarding ""LVBANGTAN""? If not, is there any way someone (maybe a K-army who has access to their fancafe) can contact Bighit and let them know someone is making fake merchandise and selling it? The merchandise looks good actually, but I really don't want someone to take advantage of us i-army and spend money on merchandise that 1) is not real 2) money does not go to our BTS boys/Bighit. It seems like a lot of people bought from them too. Would someone be kind enough to notify Bighit or the fancafe?

34,2018-8-2,2018,8,2,7,93tki4,How has BTS improved through the years?,wanderthewonder,1533161432,"Hi, fellow ARMYs! 

Im a relatively new fan (discovered BTS and this community around October last year) and now that theres a small break between the recent album and the upcoming one, Im slowly going through the pre-HYYH albums and content. I have, of course, listened to the pre-HYYH title tracks and have seen the accompanying MVs plus a few fan faves like Cypher 3, Tomorrow and Just One Day. I honestly thought I wouldnt enjoy their older music but holy hell I just got my mind blown when I heard RMs intro for Dark and Wild. Im like, *this is their intro for their debut album? For real?!* because wow thats a fucking masterpiece.

My question is, how has BTS, whether as a group or individual artists, have improved through the years? Their music was definitely more hiphop, rough and hard hitting (sorry if im bad at describing the music) than their more recent songs which feel more upbeat and smoother. I dont have any preference as I seem to enjoy most of their music, but I do wonder how they have grown in terms of music/content from an older fans point of view. 

How is it watching them grow as artists and as individuals? Are there any personal highlights or do you have any favorite performances or songs from the past thats worth going down further the rabbit hole?",34,78

We'd originally planned on going in September/October for the weather, but circumstances pushed us to the hot summer, which would have bummed me out... and then BTS announced their comeback date.

I'm basically in Korea the entire week following the release of LOVE YOURSELF  'Answer'. Freaking out, just a *little*. Bangtan got me through an incredibly difficult time in my life, and Answer kind of feels like the conclusion to a trilogy and a big part of my life.

Unfortunately, I can't spend the entire trip doing comeback things because my friend isn't quite as insane as I am. But, I would like to go to at least one taping, or something comeback related! Does anyone have any recommendations or suggestions for events or tapings, or tips on how to get in? What sorts of things would you recommend doing during their comeback while in Seoul/Korea in general?

(Mods, I hope this is okay! I know it could be general, but since it's BTS, I'm wondering if there are specific things to look out for!)",2,1

81,2018-8-3,2018,8,3,8,944d19,One In An ARMY July campaign results + new campaign info,OneInAnARMY,1533252132,"Hey r/bangtan, here to update you on our new campaign and summarize the old one at the actual beginning of the month!! 

We just wrapped up our #ThirstRelief\_July campaign, where we partnered with Thirst Relief International to provide BioSand water filters to families and schools (mostly in Tanzania) who are reliant on water sources that are contaminated due to waste and upriver industrial pollution. Overall, ARMYs from over 40 countries donated more than $3,400 to the campaign!!  That's at least 34 filters and as each filter can provide clean water for up to 10 people, that's 340 people that now have clean water for the next 25 years thanks to YOU!! People seemed to really enjoy the interactive game aspect that we introduced, so we are trying something similar for this month.

Speaking of this month, August's campaign is the first of a set of birthday campaigns we are doing for each member where we try to pick an organization that is meaningful and relates to them and run it during their birthday month. Since Jungkook and Namjoon share a month, we are running Jungkook's in August through his actual birthday. More info about the birthday campaigns in \[this\]([https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1024473830465712128](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1024473830465712128)) tweet. 

For Jungkook, our campaign is  ~~#~~**DreamWithJungkook** and we are working with KKOOM (which translates to dream, why we chose the hashtag we did). KKOOM is an organization that supports multiple children's homes in South Korea-providing access to education, physical supplies, as well as organizing events for orphans in those homes. We chose this organization for our maknae Jungkook because he has spoken often about how his six hyungs in BTS have helped to raise and shape him since came to Seoul as a teenager and how much they have helped him become the person he is today. In honor of that affectionate upbringing that turned a shy and talented young boy into the confident and caring man that we all love and admire, we selected KKOOM as this months organization to receive ARMYs support.

We are doing a couple special things this month! Firstly, based on hitting certain goals such as RTS or number of donations, fanart prizes will be unlocked for everyone! Various fanartists were kind enough to donate pieces to us for this campaign. Secondly, we are encouraging people to send postcards to US branch of KKOOM to be passed along to the kids in South Korea later this year. There are a couple other special announcements coming, so keep an eye out on our twitter!

Campaign details here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1024656067794558977](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1024656067794558977)

91,2018-8-3,2018,8,3,12,9462im,"Based on your opinion, what are each member's UNOFFICIAL ROLE in the team?",Elisora,1533266262,"Personally, I think BTS complements each other very well. I honestly think that there is not any member that can be replaceable. As we know, there are so many BTS variety/own shows out there, we can understand or see their characteristic, how they are or how they like as a person (at least from what we see from on screen). So i was wondering based on all those years we have been watching them, what are some of the unofficial roles each member play in their group.

For example, I think there is a different between Hoseok's sunshine personality and Jin's positivity and carefree personality. So I am confused between who will be the mood brighter in the team. Both of them? But for sure, during American shows/interview Jhope did a very good job breaking the awkwardness while in Korea, Jin is.

One more thing I noticed is that not too long after they debuted, between 2013-2015 when BTS were asked about ""relationship or have they make friend with any girl groups"" Suga was always one who answer and the answer was that BTS were always by themselves, they find it difficult to approach the gg. I think because Suga has this cool image so that's why he was the one to answer this sort of question to prevent BTS from any involvement or rumor?

Do you any of your own unofficial roles for any members in BTS?

NOTE: I know we can't fully know BTS or judge them for anything but I am curious on what you have seen of then from the screen. ^^

This is kind of an unanswerable question, but Im wondering if anyone has any thoughtsbased off the narratives BTS has laid out through this series, the ways theyve expressed particular life philosophies in the past, lyrics from LYH/LYT, even books we know theyve been reading. 

(I feel like weve already got a few songs from LYT that are more answer-esque in that they focus on positive ways of dealing with life (Paradise, So What) but Im so curious as to how BTS will conclude this seriesnot only musically, but conceptually/philosophically as well.

154,2018-8-5,2018,8,5,1,94k98c,I love BTS,thenewboyintown,1533399223,"Throwaway but currently I am having the worst weekend of my life. I'm awaiting an MRI brain scan to figure out whether I have a tumor or not on monday. I'm 18 and I leave for college in a week. My entire future plans can be destroyed on Monday and I don't know what to make of it. I've been an army for almost 5 years. I have seen BTS live numerous times, spent hours and hours watching their music videos, listening to their music and enjoying them.  I fell out of love with them for quite a while, ever since DNA came out because of how stressful and life has been and maturing in general. But I recently thought to myself, whats the pain of revisiting my love for bangtan? I can't stop crying. I forgot what BTS did for me, the happiness they brought. The excitement of listening to their new albums and watching their new videos. Thank you bts. Thank you for being the one thing in my life that stays constant when everything else feels like it's going to shit. 

I've been on this reddit for years so I understand this isn't really relevant but I thought I could share a story. BTS is all about loving yourself and sharing experiences right? Thought I would share mine. ",3,5
155,2018-8-5,2018,8,5,3,94l3bu,My experience at the Laser BTS show in Seattle!,CantadoraR,1533405793,"Tl;dr: The Laser Dome at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle is doing a laser BTS show every Friday in August at 9PM, and its a total blast  if youre in the area, you should totally check it out!  You can get tickets [here](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/laser-dome/?package_id=7460).

So yesterday I went to a Laser BTS show!  I had heard about this show on Tuesday, because one of my mutuals on twitter made a post about how she wished she was in Seattle and I was like, wait, thats where I am, whats going on.  So thats how I found out that the Laser Dome was doing a BTS show!  I bought two tickets in record time and then texted my best friend (who I know reads this subreddit, love you buddy) that I hoped she was free on Friday because either way, we were gonna do this.  The rest of the week was way.  Too. Slow.  I was just so excited for the show!

I was worried beforehand about how many people would be there, but it turns out that I shouldnt have!  The dome was packed - MVP the couple dads that went there to support their daughters.  There were both seats and spots to lie down on the floor, and you were allowed to bring blankets or pillows if you wanted.

The show itself was so much fun!  The songs they played were &gt;!most of the expected A sides and a couple B-sides: Pied Piper, Airplane part 2, and 134340 (aka best song on Tear, whoever voted against it in the album survivor FIGHT ME)!&lt;  It was so much fun hearing all of them in the dome, the bass there was AMAZING to say the least!

The lasers were really fun to watch, they looked like [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/2bSLEb0)! (We were allowed to take photos during the final song)

There were some of us that were hard-core doing the fanchants to all the songs but to be honest, it was hard to hear them over the music.  It was still a ton of fun to go for the chants.  Theres nothing like lying on the ground with your best friend, belting out Run, Run, Run! while a thousand lasers are going wild on the ceiling.  I seriously had the stupidest grin on my face for the entire show.

Anyways, I really just wanted to make a PSA that this show is awesome and if youre in the area, you should go!!  Its a total blast :)

The enormous revenue Big Hit earns from [**BTS**](https://kbizoom.com/tag/bts/) is obviously demonstrated by the boy group. All of the members receive the equivalent income to their effort.

175,2018-8-5,2018,8,5,22,94rrr9,My Ballin Bangtan Adventures,SeoulDesire,1533474894,"Hello, Im Janelle (@janelles_story) and I live in Seoul! I frequently do Bangtan-related stuffs on my day off, but decided to share what I did last week.

My friend from America was visiting so we showed her our usual haunts, as well as venturing to new ones.

(Sorry if pics are out of order or double posted!) 

First, I surprised her with a train trip to [Jumunjin Beach in Gangneung](https://imgur.com/a/TzkZPo5) where they did the jacket shooting for You Never Walk Alone And Jimins beach scenes in Spring Day. The beach recently installed a replica of the bus stop for ARMY to visit! Super easy to get to: just got the train to Gangneung Station then a taxi to Jumunjin (about 15,000krw). We spent a few hours just enjoying to cooler weather, avoiding the Seoul heat wave for a day. We sought shelter from the brief downpour in the bus shelter and saw quite a few groups of ARMY come and go as we did a mini-photo shoot lol. 

On Friday, my friend had left but my ARMY besties that live here as well went to see [KAWS:HOLIDAY and Jinnies restaurant ] (https://imgur.com/a/vI0uYNB) with me. I tried to upload videos but imgur is being a bish, so well see. The food was gorgeous. We made a reservation so got a private room but all the booths are privatised in cubicles. Really chic. Service was lovely. Our room had its own air con unit which was extremely notable in this heat . We got the small set of the meats and veggies, plus sides of sweet potatoes and shittake mushrooms. Took 13 minutes for the boxes to steam. We had one round of Okinawa brew then 2 bottles of Kloud. It was 107,000krw so split between 3 was about 36,000 each. Not bad at all. I mean, sure you can eat much cheaper in Seoul but its a pretty respectable price especially if you dont have beer. 

And heres a [random/miscellaneous album of BTS stuff](https://imgur.com/a/vVysrsr) I saw and did this week. 
I frequent the BT21 Cafe and stores, buying more things than I need.
I went back to Laundry Pizza were they did jacket shooting for LY:Her. 
I went up N Seoul Tower and hung a lock for Yoongi &amp; my boys 
Walked through Myeongdong enjoying their faces everywhere and went back to Lotte Duty Free Star Avenue for some quick videos. It was better in winter when all the walls were covered in them dancing and waving. I have those videos somewhere... it was hard to capture them all because people kept putting their hands in the handprints and changing the member videos, but I cant blame them. 
And last was my chill evening last night at the Han River across from Hannam-dong with a view of Namsan. 

I miss the boys  cant wait to see them in 20 days!!

Hope you enjoyed!
Heres a [bonus video of my brief JTBC fame with BTS](https://twitter.com/janelles_story/status/1015784313659355136?s=21)!

I pretty much try to do anything BTS related here. My next goals are the Young Forever abandoned airport location and the tower Tae jumped off of in Prologue (and maybe the abandoned pool!). Once the weather calms down....

# Future Survivor Games

As the album release date (8/24) is approaching quickly and Bangtan usually feeds us well, I am planning on continuing the survivor games after the promotions period.

Here is the current list of upcoming series suggestions (in tentative upcoming order). Please feel free to comment on the ideas or suggest your own :)

* Love Yourself: Answer album (the new songs only)
* Triple Mixtape Series (currently planning on doing Hope World first as most people have probably listened to the full album recently so will give time for everyone to listen to Agust D / RM)
   * Hope World
   * Agust D
   * RM
* Covers
* Unofficial Songs
* Award Show Performances (or any performances that differ significantly from their choreography)
* Run / Gayo Vlive episodes
* Era
* Pets
* Hair Color (per member)
* Face Yourself Album (either all songs or songs without Korean versions)
* Love Yourself: Her album (if anyone is interested in a re-do of the previous set as there were issues near the end)",93,143

##Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Concert at the [Ziggo Dome](https://goo.gl/maps/8p6ccWEjatR2) on Saturday 18 Octobre at 20:00

# Public transport - Openbaar Vervoer (OV): 

To get anywhere easily, you need 2 things:

1) [9292](https://9292.nl/en/): the journey planner which takes into account all means of public transport, will give you updated info/travel suggestions based on delays, etc, and will tell you the total price of your journey. You can download the app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.negentwee) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/9292/id556557690). Both the webpage &amp; the app are available in English. 

2) A transport card or a day ticket:

* If you stay within the Schiphol (airport) and Amsterdam area, you can get away with a day ticket. You can get them from 1 to 7 days and will be able to use all types of transport from the GVB (trams, metros and GVB busses - not Connexxion and EBS busses). If you need the transport to the airport, be careful to select the ticket that includes that. Check out more info on that [here](https://www.gvb.nl/tickets).
* If you'll travel further than Amsterdam or want to use trains as well, you'll need an [OV-chipkaart](https://i.imgur.com/TvQsCHF.jpg): a card that you can load money on to travel on the train, bus, tram, metro. It'll make your life much easier if you have to travel the city. You can get one for 7,50 at big stations. If you land on Schiphol airport, go to the train station part, and head to the ""Train tickets &amp; Services"" counter and buy one there. You can immediately put money on it as well. If you need to top up your card later, you can do so at one of [those yellow machines](https://i.imgur.com/keURC3z.jpg) at the station or on [smaller machines](https://i.imgur.com/BDR3S9Y.jpg) at supermarkets (eg. Albert Heijn). These can always be set to English. You can also again go to a services/help desk. 
In the Netherlands you basically pay by distance travelled, so you'll need to ""check-in"" before you get on by holding your card in front of one of these posts. For trains, they're [yellow](https://d1uyvls174j03l.cloudfront.net/ns-nl/attachment/20a155e0-321d-492a-bff7-da2bbae47720.jpg) and for metros, trams &amp; busses they're usually [pink](https://i.imgur.com/2ycUO1D.jpg). For trams and buses, the readers are usually on the tram/bus itself, while for metros &amp; trains, they're typically in the station hall and/or on the platform. When you get off, you'll again need to ""check-out"" by holding your card again at one of those posts. If you're switching from one train to another, you don't need to check-in &amp; out in-between, just do it at the station you start and at the one you finish. 
Beware that, to check-in succesfully, you'll need money on the card. That needs to be at least 20 for the train and 4 for the bus, metro or tram. When you check-out the post will always display you the amount of money you still have on your card, so you'll easily know if you need to top it up before your next journey.
Should you still have money on the card at the end off your stay in the Netherlands, you can again head to a service counter and ask for the money back. They'll be able to take it off the card for you and give it to you in cash.



# Practical things to know:

* The percentage of the Dutch population that can speak English is ridiculously high, so don't worry about the language. If you stumble on a rare specimen that can't speak English, chances are there will be 10 others in close proximty that do and can help you :) Also, don't be afraid to ask for help. The Dutch are usually a cheerful and friendly bunch ^(as long as you don't walk in their way on the bike path haha)

* The Dutch are not keen on credit cards and if that's your sole payment method, you'll probably want to carry some cash around in case a shop/restaurant/... doesn't accept credit cards. Debit cards and contactless payments are available almost everywhere for any amount of money (ie. you won't be charged extra to pay a tiny amount). If Euros are not your standard currency, be aware of the charges your bank makes you pay to pay in Euros and/or get yourself one of those fancy cards where you can change the currency via an app. (Also: 1 &amp; 2 cent coins are not used in the Netherlands. Don't be surprised if your receipt gets rounded up or down to the nearest 5c if you pay by cash!)
* The address of the Ziggo Dome is [De Passage 100, 1101 AX Amsterdam, Nederland](https://goo.gl/maps/8p6ccWEjatR2) and the nearest train station is called Bijlmer ArenA.

##Paris, France - Concert at [AccorHotels Arena](https://goo.gl/maps/nTDmcA3SNAK2) on Friday 19 &amp; Saturday 20 Octobre 20:00

##General tips:

Don't be afraid to ask follow ARMYs for help when you're queuing etc. From previous kpop concert experiences, I know that kpop concertgoers are all a jolly and warmhearted bunch. Even if people don't speak English very well, they'll try their best to help :) This actually goes for random people on the street as well!


##Notes:

I'm most familiar with the transport system in Amsterdam (since it's the same in the whole country :P) and know less about Paris &amp; Berlin, so if you are more familiar with these cities (or A'dam too!) and happen to know info or apps that might be useful, please let me know and I'll add it!

Also if you have any other things you're curious about or more standard vocabulary that you'd like added, feel free to ask!

I didn't add London to this because there's no language barrier, but if anybody wants, I can add it too, since I'm a bit familiar with the tube &amp; oyster card system anyway :) Just ask!

Lastly... damn, I'm really increasingly excited that this will finally happen! Hope you all have fun! :D

How do they manage to have it especially while also took place in abroad, i was wondering about the budget since they were a small company. Or is it because BH is smart to invest in such show to get BTS out there because they did not make many appearance in other variety shows??

233,2018-8-7,2018,8,7,2,953bgf,[LY ANSWER] My Theory from the new note #TheNotes,Elisora,1533576766,"Okay guys, so i just read the trans theory from twitter and I'm having some theory, please hear me out. I'm gonna quote a few things from the ~~#~~TheNotes.

So my take on this whole thing is that Seokjin decided to time travel back in time AGAIN. ""I knew my father experienced the same thing as me"" I think both seokjin's dad and seokjin himself had travelled back to the past before and try to change bad things but both of them always failed (in other MVs we saw bad things has changed and have a good outcome but then they would experience other bad things again). Seokjin dad travelled back to fix things, but in the end, ""he ultimately gave up and failed, he ignored, he forgot, he betrayed his friend"" 

All this time, his father recorded those incidents in his note. As jin has read it, he felt all those emotions of fear &amp; struggle ""the handwriting still remained, the fear, struggle, weak hope my dad experienced stormed into me, map of his refract soul still remain in the note"". I think jin probably didnt want that to happen to him and not helping his friend sobecause Jin felt those feelings from his dads note, that's why after reading the note, he REALISED SOMETHING (Have an EPIPHANY?) which making him travel back in time one more time to the past again, but this time, instead of fixing the bad outcome of his bad actions or mistakes, he decided toadmit his fault, his mistakes and faces himself and the consequences instead ""I thought not all of this is coincidence, I had to arrive here and find mistakes I have been committing so I could make first step to find map of my soul""

Not sure about this one, but I think because he went back to the storage room and saw and read his dad's note, it leads him to travel back and live an honest life, embrace his good and bad points in life and that leads to the happy era which is Euphoria era. 

Because the theme is Love Yourself, so Jin needs to love himself first so that he could be able to love his friends and other people. 

Thats my theory. There are some things that I couldnt understand in the note, for example Taehyung was trying to make Jin remember their past memories together. Jin lost his memory? What do you think? if you have any theory, please share &lt;3 Thank you for reading",2,7
234,2018-8-7,2018,8,7,3,953kso,Amor Fati- LY Answer?,dridnishchay,1533578498,"So, this can be very vague and perhaps too early as well but I want to bring up the concept of Nietzsche's Eternal Return. I don't know why I didn't think of this before because I kept wondering the significance/the influence of Nietzsche in the narratives since we know Joon has often brought the dude up. So, hear me out. Joonie once mentioned Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being as being like a 'bible' for Bang PD during his college days. Check this out-

*The phrase ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" is Kundera's own, but to understand it we actually have too start with Friedrich Nietzsche and the idea of ""eternal return."" Eternal return is the idea that our universe and our existence has occurred an infinite number of times in the past, and will continue to occur ad infinitum. In this theory, time is cyclical rather than linear. The idea of eternal return is an ancient one, but Nietzsche, a 19th century German philosopher, popularized it for modern times. That's why the narrator ofUnbearable Lightnessrefers to it as Nietzsche's concept.

Nietzsche explored what the consequences of such eternal return would be. In his eyes, eternal return wasdas schwerste Gewicht, or ""the heaviest weight."" It was a petrifying concept to imagine that our lives have been and will continue to be repeated endlessly. But one could learn, through philosophy, to love the idea. The proper mind can embrace this weight, rather than be terrified by it. Nietzsche seems to conclude inThus Spoke Zarathustrathat we must live and act as though our lives functioned in eternal return, suggesting that we give our own lives meaning and weight by behaving this way. This brings in the concept ofamor fati, or the love of one's fate. To embrace eternal return is, roughly speaking, to love one's fate. We talk more about fate in ""Symbolism, Imagery, Allegory,"" so keep this in mind.

In Kundera's world, eternal return is a false premise. ""Human time does not turn in a circle,"" he argues; ""it runs ahead in a straight line"" (7.4.13). So what are the consequences? Well, Nietzsche said that eternal return gives our lives with a sense of weight. So if our lives only occur once, it must mean that they are filled with lightness. This is where Kundera's phraseeinmal ist keinmalcomes into the picture. He translates this for us: ""What happens but once, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all"" (1.3.18).

If we live only once, then we can never compare the decisions we make to any alternatives. And if we can never compare different outcomes, we can never know if the decisions we made are correct or not, which means we can neverjudgethem properly or take responsibility for them. Hence, to live only once is to live with lightness. It's important to keep in mind that Kundera doesn't pose the question of whether life is heavy or light  he suggests that it is light, and then asks questions from there.

And the major question is this: which is better? Do we want lightness, or do we want weight? Which do we choose? Kundera takes a look at Parmenides, a Greek philosopher in the 5th century B.C. who considered the same question. Parmenides argued that lightness was positive and to be desired, while weight was negative. But the narrator ofThe Unbearable Lightness of Beingisn't so sure about this. ""The heaviest of burdens is [] simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment,"" he says (1.2.4). ""The heavier the burden, [] the more real and truthful [our lives] become"" (1.2.4).


Kundera argues that lightness is unbearable, but it is up to us as readers to understand the reasons behind this argument. What makes lightness unbearable? Remember Nietzsche's interpretation of eternal return? It's scary, almost paralyzing, to think about eternal return. **But on the other hand, it means our lives have meaning, significance, weight. And we can learn to love that.** Conversely, lightness may seem at first to be a sweet deal  no responsibility, no judgment, no meaning. Sounds like fun  at first. But eventually, we wouldlikefor our lives to mean something. We want them to have weight and significance, because we want them to matter. * 

(Analysis of the Book Credit- Smoop.com)


Hence,

The **ANSWER** could possibly be;


*AMOR FATI* 

: A sense of contentment in one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.

Love yourself for who you are with all your cracks and scars, in all your dark times and mistakes and in a manner that allows you to truly embrace yourself.

I love data and BTS so I wanted to practice and test my skills on data analysis with BTS' data. I chose their YouTube channel because it's home to 850+ videos, and I was curious which videos would stand out in terms of views, likes, and comments. 

# HERE'S THE LINK: [https://binkymilk.github.io/2018-08-04/bangtantv](https://binkymilk.github.io/2018-08-04/bangtantv)

It's a bit of a long read because I elaborate my process in my blog post as well but you can just skim through and view the top 10 lists. Also, I would really appreciate some feedback on my analysis to improve my work. I added links to every video so you could watch it if you want a refresher. Hope you have fun browsing through and finding old but gold gems (because I had fun too seeing there are a lot of golden videos I haven't seen).

Note: The data is a bit outdated (I scraped the data last July 29) so I apologize if it's not the recent one. It took me more than a week as well to finish this.

P.S. Also if you see some errors, you can notify me as well! I always love some constructive criticism :)  ",26,101

..:\*Love yourself reel..:\*

The girls are what they wanted to be. The girls died because bts couldn't do the things right and they 'can't turn back time'.

Namjoons girl had no place to go to. She had no worries . She slept in the bus.

Taehyungs girl followed him and told him to delete the memories. The bad ones (purification proof).

Jungkooks girl wanted him to be cheerful and she wanted him to remember things. She drew drawings and stuff. Listened to music with him.

Yoongis girl got rid of his cigarette and gave him a lollipop (sweet and better for health). She wanted him to live healthy.

Jhopes girl succeeded in joining to the competition. Jimins girl could dance well, which he couldn't do.

As for Jin, there's not much details.

Jin might have killed jungkook using the car (proven through reel compare the cars at 11:07 and 11:18)

Anyway so taehyung got reminded of his father when Jin hit him. That's why he ""killed"" Jin.

      

:\*:,:\*:butterfly:\*:,:\*:

Taehyung didn't die. He wore the same hoodie he wore when he killed his father. He wanted to get rid of that memory. He wanted to purify himself.

\* flowers \*

The flower was first seen in the comeback trailer (suga singing) , it was about expectations about adulthood. 'Having dreams, living happily' . The flower in the video represents childhood. The flower's petals end up leaving. He can no longer save his childhood.

Jin may be the older self. He can't be with them (they're part of his childhood) and they can't be with him. (Proof-&gt; the picture burned by jimin). Also the other proof is that in bst, the statue not only has jins cracks but also jimins colorful tears. It also appears that in another mv, jungkook had the same tears. Taehyung had the black tears appear in singularity. He also may be the younger self as he doesn't want to face reality since he keeps on trying to go away from the sad memories. (New bts the notes is proof). Also, he keeps taking videos of the happy moments. He doesn't want to face the sad moments. That's why he's kinda like a child I guess (?). In euphoria, jungkook wanted to get rid of Jin or get rid of the camera (not sure, probably the camera since Jin might have not fell)

To me, all of the mvs are dreams. The answer album is probably gonna have them wake up and actually face reality.

  {}  

..osingularityo..

\-ice river/winter= the mask that's finally melting but slowly (just like how the song is slow)

\- the tear on the mask= his inability to love the fake him

\-the 'loved' sign on his ear = being able to love the real him since it's on his ear which is not covered by the mask

      

       wings        

Mama&gt;

His mom had to support his dancing by working hard in places to fill in the debts. (He's hallucinating that his mom was there with him supporting him, if you see the notes the doctor wrote, it said that he has gone insane)

Reflection&gt;

there's the word 'liar' because namjoon promised taehyung he would take care of the things with the police (notes year 22 may 22 taehyung)

There was a lack of communication between them two thus why namjoon is unable to pick up the phone

The Wings circles have a weird combination:

Tae and jhope

Jimin and suga

Rm and jungkook

Then the Boy meets evil is released. Jin is finally meeting evil too.

Anyways, jhope points the arrow at tae (jhopes sin)

Suga closed jimins eyes and stayed near his piano instead of jimin (sugas sin)

Rm made jungkook drink the absinthe (rms sin)

Rm

Suga

Jhope

These are the influencers

Jungkook

Jimin

Tae

These are influenced

That's why the influenced first appear as the circles then the influencers appear (they meet evil)

It may seem odd to hear, but my recent post [defending journalism education](https://medium.com/@tony_ganzer/why-journalism-education-matters-aba4c0069223)caught fire among some fans of the K-pop megagroup BTS.

These ARMYs, as they call themselves, kind of adopted me after [I stumbled into a Twitter campaign](http://www.ideastream.org/news/for-fans-of-k-pop-megagroup-bts-its-not-just-about-the-music) to benefit UNICEF.

My post about journalism education resonated because these fans have been burned by writers who didnt report to their satisfaction. Many fans pride themselves on a sense of philanthropy, mental health, and community support, which extend beyond the music and the group. If a writer focuses only on the size of the fandom, or the novelty of their interest, they feel stung

It may be to the extent that if you're playing your music on shuffle, it pains you to hear one song without the other. We all have different favorite songs and favorite sections off each album, so I feel like this is a fairly subjective question that will generate some interesting responses.

A few of mine are:

* mama - awake (this may be because I've listened to 'mama' so much and/or because the violin opening to 'awake' is so pretty it would sound good as a transition anywhere, but it's also a very warm violin part that reminds me of a mother's love)
* best of me - dimple (the echoing at the end of 'best of me' matches well with the echoing at the start of 'dimple' and, again, it is so pretty)
* airplane - blue side (j-hope's mixtape is a whole freaking journey, and the way this ending couplet sends us off into the clouds.............sigh)",33,66

353,2018-8-10,2018,8,10,1,95y0mb,"The ""Epiphany"" Trailer, and its possible reference to The 1975's ""Somebody Else""",LiamUrARelevant,1533832474,"OK, IMO, this theory maybe a bit of a reach, as I'm both an ARMY and a 1975 fanboy, but a few seconds into the newly released ""Epiphany"" trailer, I noticed something particularly interesting about it. (Other than the song itself, of course, which is quite a jam. Quite a pity, really, that Jin doesn't get a lot of lines in BTS' songs often.)

In the trailer, &gt;!Jin is depicted as dressing up for his date, the one where he was supposed to give a bouquet of Smeraldo flowers to his love interest in the LOVE YOURSELF short film. (We all know what happened afterwards.) Then, another Jin, who's apparently been sitting in a sofa in front of a TV set as previously-mentioned Jin dressed up, reads a magazine. As this happens, the camera pans to a similarly dressed Jin who is crying underneath a window with curtains (a recurring image in the Bangtan Universe.) Afterwards, Jin from the sofa gets up, takes a jacket (the same one worn earlier) from a closet and wears it (color seeping through the footage as this happens), and after washing his face, which his earlier self did a minute ago, gets out of the room. Jin then walks into heavy rainfall (a/n: it started raining hard as I was typing this lol), whose raindrops initially fell downwards but subsequently reversed. He comes back inside, holding his jacket, and walks out of the frame as another Jin is seen sitting in the sofa while the camera pans out. That Jin then goes to the window and looks out for a few seconds (presumably after going back in time, as most other theories would suggest) before closing the curtains and... going to the closet, taking the same jacket from earlier, washing his face, taking something from the glass coffee-table, and leaving the room for the last time. Only, as all this happens, the song ends, the video goes back to monochrome, the camera stays steady, and audio effects are placed as Jin dresses up and leaves.!&lt;

This entire scene, in my personal observations, may be a reference to the intro sequence for The 1975's ""Somebody Else"" music video. In it, Matty Healy's character from the ""A Change of Heart"" music video enters a room with a robed version of himself sitting in a sofa (rings any bells?), and is seen changing from the clown costume and makeup he'd previously put on to casual attire. As all this happens, audio effects similar to the ones heard at &gt;!the beginning and end of the ""Epiphany"" trailer!&lt; are placed, including some that weren't there in the newer video, such as chatter, bells, chimes, laughter, and applause. The two Mattys also seem to be talking to one another through gibberish noises. (A reference to David Lynch's ""Rabbits,"" where the intro sequence takes inspiration from. ^(Source: Wikipedia)) By the end of the sequence, Matty looks at his robed self as he leaves the room with his skateboard and goes to a lone night out after a breakup. (Presumably the one depicted in ""A Change of Heart"".)

For me, the similarities makes sense as, towards the end of the ""Somebody Else"" music video, it appears that the reason why Matty had so many breakups is because he never loved himself (going so far as to show, in the ending scene, each and every one of his exes seen in the video as Matty *himself.*) And as you may have noticed in countless interviews back in June, RM explains that the meaning behind ""Fake Love"" and the entirety of Love Yourself: Tear is that if you're not true to yourself and you don't **love yourself**, then any relationship won't last.

The trailer for Love Yourself: Answer is quite sad and evokes emotions that we as humans will all eventually feel. Paired with a song as powerful as ""Epiphany,"" none of us knows how much the new tracks will tug our heartstrings and / or bring our energy.

^(ok ok i'll stop being emotional.)  Anyways, that's my theory for this video. I hope the trailer would make sense to each and everyone us now. Have a good day. ",22,96

Personally, i really like the song. I thought its like sad version of serendipity and it fit well because epiphany serve as song that conclude LY series. As always, bighit always deliver the intro very well that really suited with members voice and personal taste of music. This song also gave me a soundtrack vibe for indie movie  like 500 days of summer,etc. It has that euphoric feeling. Btw, i also think that bighit can branch out to make soundtrack for korean dramas. They have talents for this based on epiphany, dont leave me, butterfly, euphoria short movie, etc. 

So, what you guys think about the song?",52,82

And closes the curtain( It's a portal to travel back in time). But  eventually his friends also gets saved. Maybe because the other 6 also eventually learned to love themselves in order  to fix their own life. And one day in future they will enjoy the sunset again in the beach. Thats the end of the story...


I think this is the real ending of this story line. Why?
-Because of south korea's new law Jin and Suga has to go to the military very soon. BTS can't perform as a group for next 2-6 years. Who knows what will happen to them in such a long

\~The Truth Behind the Storyline\~

So, I have finally figured out, with near certainty, the true storyline that takes place in the BTS Universe. As most know, the BTS Universe is a fictional world where the characters from many of BTS music videos and other videos live within. This universe began alongside the start of BTS HYYH era (The Most Beautiful Moment of Life), and ever since then, ARMYs have been creating theories upon theories upon theories about the true story and meaning of the BTS Universe. In reality, it was debatably impossible to discover the truth of this storyline- until the release of Epiphany (Aug. 9). Epiphany is the single video that alone allows us to finalize and confirm the truth behind the storyline; it is vital to the storyline as a whole, as without it, ARMYs could never be certain of the truth. Many theories have emerged over time, especially after the release of Epiphany and the confirmation that this song accompanied by the upcoming album Love Yourself: Answer will officially end the Love Yourself era; however, I am convinced that my theory is the most accurate.

This was a sudden realization; I just thought of this theory as I was walking up the stairs (You could say I had experienced an Epiphany). Therefore, this is not a detailed -and by no means completed- theory. Nonetheless, I hope my theory will enlighten other ARMY about the truth and inspire them to do research alongside me to further confirm and explain my theory. So here goes:

Many ARMYs have theorized Jin is the main character of this BTS Universe, and yes, indeed, they are absolutely correct. As a matter of fact, the other six members are equally insignificant with each other; they are to be observed as a **group of six** rather than six separate individuals. Although their stories are interesting, they are individually insignificant to the story as a whole. Ultimately, it is most important to pull from the stories of the six (RM, j-hope, SUGA, Jimin, Jungkook, and Tae) the collective suffering they endure throughout the storyline (multiple times; three to be precise) (Ill explain later). So essentially, we have **two** significant entities in this storyline: Jin, and his friends (**two** different things, not seven).

Now, onto Jin. Who is Jin? Why is he the most important of any other member? Well, this is the vaguest part of the theory, but thats OK. The storyline **never and will never** give an explanation as to why *Jin* was selected as the many character; it simply doesnt have to. It also doesnt have to explain whatever magic (for lack of better term) surrounds Jin and imprisons him in the sort of hell-like reality he has been banished to. This is the basis of the story; Jin has been *cursed*. By who? By what? We do not know, and like I said, will not know. But we do know what Jin has been cursed with: Immortality (One could also make the argument that Jin is stuck in purgatory. Either works completely fine and the same). With this immortality, two things can either happen: he can die or he can choose to terminate his life willingly. Either way, he can die/be killed/choose to end the current life he is in and still remain immortal. Where does he go when his life ends? He returns. Back to **his room**. What room you may ask? Well, none other than the room presented in Epiphany. What is in this room? Well, nothing too notable, with the exception of one item: **his journal**. 

Jin is tasked to enter the world (by exiting the door in his room). His goal when he enters the world is to **make his friends happy**. Simple. For the first time (as far as we know), he enters the world. This time he enters the world that can be referred to as the **HYYH era**. He sets off on his goal to live a happy life with love and with his friends. We can see everything is going well with the Prologue video, where Jin and his friends enjoy life and have fun (in simple terms). But as we know, *everything goes south*. Everything crashes down, all so suddenly: the friend group is **torn apart**, V stabs and **murders his father**, Jungkook gets **hit by a car**, etc. We dont know exactly how Jin ends his life, whether he has to suffer through the ruins of his life until he dies, commits suicide, or can magically snap his fingers, but either way, he returns to his room: a failure. He writes as much as he can in his journal: what he did right, what went wrong, things he should do next time to avoid corruption. And then, he puts his journal down, looks into the mirror one last time, and opens the door to try again: **the end of an era**.

Here Jin enters a new world; a new attempt at living a happy life with his friends. Here we enter the era of **Wings**. As opposed to three, we only have one album to work with here. As other ARMYs have theorized the opposite, I do not believe You Never Walk Alone (including Spring Day of course) has a place in the BTS Universe; it was more just to add some more nice songs and music videos to the band. So in Wings, everything happens quite fast. As a matter of fact, the entire set up and climax of this era occurs within Blood Sweat and Tears. A nice, peaceful visit to the museum (or whatever it symbolizes); things are goin great. And then basically everything turns to hell as the devil himself temps each and every member into committing one of the seven deadly sins (as suggested by the intro, Boy Meets Evil). As we have heard from other theories, each solo Wings song (and video) represents one of the members **succumbing to the temptation of evil**. Of course, in the end, each member dies or mentally corrupts, but the main point is Jin has failed, again. He expresses how he just wants to **love the other members** no matter whether he is **as good as them or not** in his own solo song, Awake. After Awake, the rest of the album is insignificant to the storyline. From here, Jin returns back to his room (dies) and records what he has learned in his journal; **the end of an era**.

And now we enter the third era: the **Love Yourself era**. In the Highlight Reels, we witness Jin in the world **with his journal**. Perhaps Jin is analyzing his past mistakes based on what he has written down. This would explain why he **takes a new approach to things**. What is distinct in this era from other eras is the fact that Jin is **never with the other members**. Perhaps Jin now realizes that, after two eras where all of his friends suffer immensely and die horrible deaths, he would be content with his friends living their own lives, independent of each other, as long as they are **happy**. Instead of the other members, who do they find? Girlfriends, or, maybe not exactly gfs, like in RMs case, but at least friends that are girls (and that they **care about**). Well Jin, you finally did it! All your friends are happy, and you are too with your girlfriend! Oh wait, no you didnt. Again, everything falls apart; Jimin falls and like bleeds to death or something, Yoongi rages on his girl, Hobis step-sis is smacked across the face SO DAMN HARD by SuperJimin that she FUCKING DIES. And then Hobi dies on some bridge. Oh wait, I forgot, **and then Jins girlfriend gets hit by a car**. Well shit..., says Jin, as he exits reality and returns to his room, How tf. At least he didnt lose his journal? And there Love Yourself goes; **the end of an era**. ***But only the beginning of Love Yourself*****.**

Welp, there sits Jin, in his room, with a third failure on his shoulders. His only company is his journal, and the lingering fact that he has failed his friends, himself, and his destiny, for a **third time**. With this, he has **a lot** to reminisce about. He thinks and thinks and thinks: how could this happen? Why cant I just live happily with my friends? All I want is **to love them**. And then he **wonder**s: did I really love them, or did I want them to be happy for my own satisfaction? He now understands that his love was not real; **FAKE LOVE**. He asks himself, *How could I love others when I dont love myself?* And there it is, the **answer**; the ***EPIPHANY*** (Epiphany: A sudden strike or realization; a feeling that you **finally understand something important to you**). Jin realizes that all this time, even though he didnt *know it*, even though he didnt *mean it*, he was emitting *fake love* (In the video, the epiphany is represented by the strike of lightning, where before the strike, the rain falls down on Jin, whereas after the strike, the rain lifts up and off of Jin)*.* And there, in the Epiphany video, we are shown evidence of all of which I have stated: we see Jin at the beginning- not one, but two Jins. No, they do not exist at the same time. The Jin on the couch is the one reminiscing, the one searching for that sudden strike, searching for epiphany. And the other Jin is the one of his past. Shortly after he leaves, we see him come back, sitting beneath the windowsill, seemingly devastated. Why? Well, we know why: because this is the Jin who just returned from the Love Yourself era, an era where he lets all of his friends down and then lets them die, for a *third time*. Id say thats pretty devastating. But *how do we know this is the Jin who returns from the Love Yourself era?* Watch Epiphany again, and you will realize: **there are only two Jins**. **More Jins do not come**. Basically, if I were to simplify it, Jin 1, the Jin on the couch, watches Jin 2 return from the Love Yourself era. Then, Jin 1 leaves the room and experiences the epiphany. Jin 1 returns from the epiphany, and sees Jin 2 on the couch. *Exactly where Jin 1 was before he left to find the epiphany*. Therefore, we can assume that Jin 2 will then observe as another Jin comes in (from the Love Yourself era) and goes to cry under the windowsill, and then Jin 2 wll get up and leave to experience the epiphany, **like a cycle**. Personally, I do not believe the whole cycle thing means anything, they just have it there to show which Jin is which and when things are going on relative to the BTS Universe storyline as a whole. So the next question you may ask is, *what happens to Jin 1?* (Another way to think of Jin 1 is just the Jin who is *farthest in the future, farther than Jin 2 basically the one we should focus on and care about, the same thing happens to all of them*). Well, Jin 1 (who I will refer to as Jin from now on) leaves the room. What does he take with him? *His journal*. Why does he take his journal with him? *Because he will not have to return to this room ever again*. By realizing that Loving himself was the answer, Jin has lifted his curse, and no longer has to suffer alongside his friends. Now, he can go and live a happy life, where he can emitt ***REAL LOVE*** to his friends. 

Ahhhh, finally. It feels so relieving to find a theory that is without-flaw. I truly believe with sincere certainty that this is the *correct* theory. Everything clicks, everything makes sense. I have thought of counter-arguments to this theory, and *none of them work*. Every little thing can be accounted for in this theory, and it makes perfect sense that this is the theory that BTS followed to produce their story; I cannot imagine that they were following anything else. NOW, that does not mean of course that I think my theory is *perfect*, of course. I think it could be communicated with much more clarity, while accounting for even more events that occur in the BTS Universe that I failed to mention. Now for some clarification.

1. You may be wondering about the other members, and why the entire theory revolves around Jin and *never another member*. Thats because the story *does* revolve around Jin. The other members only significance is to clarify that **a)** *They are friends of Jin* **b)** *They suffer* and **c)** *Jin loves them*. If you feel like this is unfair that Jin gets all the attention, please dont: each member gets not one, not two, but three of their life stories explained throughout the storyline (one for each era). They have a vital role *together, as a group of six*, yet their stories individually are so well done and well executed. 
2. *What about the intros for the Love Yourself Series?* Yes, the intros are significant, and I will make sure to look more into them as I only mentioned one of the four in this theory; however, Epiphany was the only one I *needed* to mention for the theory as a whole to make sense.
3. *You didnt mention anything about the* ***masks*** *in Fake Love even though the masks are such a major aspect of the songs and over many other of their songs.* Yes, I have a full grasp of this message they are trying to communicate through the masks; however, I have, for now, personally decided that they do not contribute to the theory. BTS has to focus on two main things when creating a theme for a *title track*. **1)** Its connection to the BTS Universe Storyline and **2)** An individual message that *only this song focuses on*. If you think about it, there are two parts to Fake Love. **1)** Fake Love and **2)** The difference between you when you do not have the mask on and you when you do. Fake Love contributes *directly* to the greater message of *Loving Yourself* and furthermore the BTS Universe, while the masks contribute more to a message that this song and this album is trying to deliver separate from the greater message. *Fake Love and The Masks are no- debt connected to each other however*. Like I said, I fully understand what they are trying to communicate with the mask symbolization; I thought about it long before BTS released Love Yourself: Tear. Did you know that the man in the mask towards the end of the Fake Love music video is actually Jungkook himself? Yep, it is. Id be happy to make a post independent from the BTS storyline that just focuses on the smaller message of Fake Love and the symbolization of masks.
4. Im sure there are many other questions you have. Please ask them! Id be happy to modify or change my theory or discuss with you a new thought or question that you have!
5. Although I seem like I know a lot about BTS, which I do, Im still rusty on a lot of the earlier storyline and I may have to rewatch them if you have a question about them or if you catch something I said about them that is wrong. In this theory, however, I am confident about everything I mentioned about HYYH and Wings.
6. I thought of this theory ON MY OWN. If youve heard a theory similar to it or really similar to it, I have no connection to it. I thought of this on my own regardless of whether or not other ARMY have proposed this theory. I would love to know if others have though.
7. Im a boy ARMY and no Im not gay (Youd be surprised, the internet asks me a lot if I am, I guess boy ARMY are rare and most are. gay). In fact, you can follow my insta @maxwhite19. Id be happy to follow back!
8. Yes this is my first Reddit post. I dont use Reddit often, but I hope to in the future so I can connect with more ARMY!
9. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING!!! Truly, thanks. It means a ton. I just wanted to get this theory out. I thought of it at about 8:30 pm today, and it is now 11 pm. My dream is for just a few people to see this and read it, and hopefully they will experience the epiphany that I did when I suddenly realized the truth about the BTS Universe storyline. Again, thanks. I have no idea if anyone will actually read this.",26,95

I know this may seem like a negative topic, but it's really more so me creating a topic on what's really the best way to get tickets for this and whether or not to even believe resale sites because they post tickets before they are even on sale.

Before that let me introduce my self.

I've start listening to BTS back at 2014 when they release   . Though I'm not an avid fan back then but I occasionally listen to some of their song and I've always like their skit. 

Recently I fell into depression and it was a really hard time. Until one time when I was scrolling YouTube I came across to V - Singularity. I've always like this kind of music and V's voice make it much better and for the first time I actually look the meaning behind the lyric (I usually don't care about lyric in any song. As long as the music suit my taste, I'll listen to it) and watched the MV. The song made me feel like someone actually understand me. I came across one of V's interview 

&gt;Don't keep the problem to yourself. Talk with other

IIRC, that's when he open up to Jimin and it really help me. I decided to do the same and now I'm slowly overcoming my depression :D. Every now and then, the thought will come to me and I would loop their playlist for whole day. Stigma, Singularity, Autumn Leaves and Coffee Shop is my favorite and Soulmate (Skit) always make me smile.

Recent;y they drop new teaser for their upcoming album which I believe the last series in Love Yourself? and I wanted to support them by buying the album. So my question is, what is the best place to buy the album? for Malaysian to be specific? that will actually counted into music chart (billboard, etc)? Don't know what it's actually called but I guess something like this (stated on amazon)?

&gt; This release will count toward the Billboard / Hanteo / Gaon Charts 				    	 					 

Amazon would be my last option if there's none for Malaysian.

Thank you and sorry for the long post. I just wanted to share my story and since this is my first time buying a physical album, so I don't really know where to start. Hope you guys can help!",2,2

533,2018-8-15,2018,8,15,12,97f7fm,My Java program counting the number of lines sang/rapped by each BTS member,AngC1998,1534305575,"Hello!

Besides being a fan of BTS (just got into them this year), I also do coding as a favorite hobby as well (as a CS major going into 2nd year) and this is the first year that I've been coding seriously for practical applications (I've learned how to code for a few years but haven't done much until just recently after first-year college experiences). Recently, I've heard complaints from many BTS fans/ARMY (especially from fellow Tae stans (not only solo) since my #1 bias is Tae) on how there's some sort of uneven/unfair line distribution in many of BTS's songs (with some members getting way more lines than others and some getting way less lines than others), so I decided to code a program in Java to understand to find out. 

My program did several things: it counted the total number of lines that each member sang or rapped in each album BTS has released and I know well of (again, I became a fan recently so I don't know much of their older songs except for a few exceptions), the total number of lines that each member sang or rapped in each title song known, and the total number of lines that each member sange or rapped in a couple of my favorite songs. Counting number of lines to determine line distribution is honestly not the best way to determine the contribution that each member did for their album or song, but it was the quickest way for me to do as I wanted to get immediate results and a bigger picture of analysis (something I can get in a day or two-measuring by time would take a little longer lol). 

Link:  r/https://github.com/AngC1998/BTSLineDistribution.git 

The program I created was pretty basic and simple (not going to be as great in coding quality as a Reddit user in this subreddit did for analyzing BANGTANTV (pretty impressed by that tbh)) , nothing too elegant or professional or high-quality as I wanted to get quick and immediate results (again) and use the program for theoretical and analytical (not practical) purposes (I didn't intend to post the program and files on Github but a friend who saw what I was doing encouraged me too so I had to clean up some of my code for a more professional/stylistic appearance). I also attached the text files of the lyrics of the songs used (along with the names of the members above each line every time they sang or rapped) for my analysis. There might be some errors with my results/analysis, but all I wanted to get was a big picture of the BTS line distribution. For albums, I didn't include intros, outros, and solos (and sometimes songs involving only vocal or rap line) for a fairer analysis of the distribution (but please let me know in the comments below if you want me to include the intros, outros, and solos for more accurate results). I'll include the results (in a txt file) in the Github repository once I finish with this post lol. This is not the only program (or mini or side project) that I coded that involves BTS, I'm also working on several other side projects involving BTS that are more elegant, practical, and professional (in appearance) than this program (but haven't been finished yet-I hope to post them here as well once I finish them). 

Feel free to look through my Github repository, and leave feedback in the comments below. Thank you! :) ",10,82

548,2018-8-15,2018,8,15,23,97iwp9,Discussion about the likelihood that Citi Field will sell out and the impact on the possibility of a stadium tour in the US (and elsewhere),marie569,1534344977,"Hi, this is my first post!  I became an ARMY when Love Yourself: Tear was released; my friends and I streamed LYT for the sole purpose of beating Post Malone on BB200 and then became fans!  Alas, the timing meant that we missed the opportunity to buy tickets for US portion of the world tour.  Needless to say, we were ecstatic when Citi Field was added!  I will be scrambling on August 17 to get tickets; Im bracing myself for what others have described as the hunger games.  

I dont know much about the music industry, but I would think that BTSs ability to book Citi Field meant that Big Hit, the venue, and the promoters believe there is sufficient demand to sell all or most of the tickets.  Can anybody drop some knowledge on how this works?

**But do you think that BTS actually will be able to sell out Citi Field?**  My fingers are crossed, but I have nagging reservations given that they already sold out two nights at the nearby Prudential Center (as well as Chicago &amp; Hamilton, the nearest cities).  I hate being a Debbie Downer, but 40K+ tickets is quite a lot of tickets to sell on top of the tickets sold for the Prudential Center.  Even if there is sufficient interest, not everybody has the financial means to attend, especially if it requires paying for long-distance transportation and accommodations.  If BTS had instead booked a stadium in Atlanta or even D.C., I probably wouldnt have the same concerns.

If Citi Field doesnt sell out, some salty people likely will call BTS a failure, notwithstanding that they sold out all other venues.  But what concerns me is how this could impact their ability to book more stadiums during their next US tour; my guess is that it would depend on the percentage of tickets sold. 

Also, does anybody know whether booking Citi Field will impact BTSs ability to book stadiums in other countries for the next tour?  My guess is no and that (like politics), everything is local.  

What do you guys think?  Will BTS be able to sell out Citi Field on August 17? ",95,114

I don't watch a lot of fancams except if it is of jk(he's my bias) and till now he has made all their dancing look easy. The whole group looks like they are dancing so good.

But after watching Jin, RM and Suga, I realized how hard these guys work. If you have watched the vids, you can see how they are tired but are trying their best. You can see all the efforts they make to dance, to be in sync, to give a wonderful performance. 

They try to have a neutral face when they aren't performing their part but you can see they are tired and there is a sudden change of attitude when they sing or rap. Completely effortless. Right expressions. Not a hint of any tiredness.

Jin, you are really good. You out of all 3 made me realize how difficult the dance was and I could see all the practice you did.

RM, I can imagine you being tired after all those interviews in America. Yet, you put up a smile for us all. Your dance was fabulous. 

Suga danced the best out of the 3. He was more dynamic and energetic. I get it yoongi if you wanna rest all day because you are giving your best even though you don't like it.

Taehyung, thank you for giving such beautiful expressions throughout the performance. I thoroughly enjoyed your fancam. I just couldn't take my eyes off you. I never knew you were so good.

After this, I can feel how much these guys work. How many hours of practice they must have put to give effortless performances. The dance line, now I feel you more than ever.

Joseph Kahn, idk why them having plastic surgery matters. 

I don't know if this is worth posting but I am going to anyway.

Now imagine V saying annyeong.

Im planning on buying tickets for the both of us from the MLB site, because I didnt see any for the October 6th date on ticket master. I also wont be able to buy them exactly at 4:00 pm because well be doing something else at that time that we cant push off.

I woke up and saw everyone was very excited because Nicki Minaj and BTS had tweeted each other. Everyone seemed so happy, but my heart dropped. Not because I don't like her as an artist, but because of some upsetting things she's done that make me feel awful.

Her latest musical work featured a known child sex offender and she's no stranger to using homophobic/transphobic lyrics. And nobody seems to care. I do believe the boys don't know about these issues (although I wish their company did some more research).

Some people are so excited because they think Nicki will collab with the boys, but I'm terrified. If they do work together, do I support them? Am I a bad fan if I don't? It would be a great opportunity for them, but I just couldn't. Especially as BTS is involved in a campaign to protect children from violence, but this woman has supported several people who have done terrible things against children.

So my question is: if they work with someone who you can't support for moral reasons, what would you do? Can someone help me feel a little less upset?",66,97

600,2018-8-17,2018,8,17,0,97t78h,Appreciate V,wilson688,1534432874,"I got into Kpop just few months back and I did it after watch BTS. I am not a fan of kpop in general but I love BTS and every member. I love V/Taehyung and he is the main reason why I got into BTS. I , saw him on running man once and later I recently watched him in a drama (Hwarang) and did some background search did not find any other dramas or movies but found  an OST of that drama sang by him and I liked it. And after that I finally found the group and started appreciating each and every member but I really wanted to get to know V better cause he is the reason why I got into BTS. 

I am going to be honest with my feelings so please do not hate on me this is how I feel and I want to know others opinion on it correct me if I am wrong. 

I love how smart RM is! Being a book lover I appreciate his lyrics and deep meaning of every word that he writes... 

I love Suga for his genius rap and his songs too.. 

I love Jin for his voice, his confidence and how he cares for other members.. 

I love Jhope for being Jhope! I love his part and makes me wanna jump with excitement.. 

I love Jungkook for his beautiful voice and how good he is to other members.. 

I love jimin for his voice and sometimes he looks so adorable.. 

But I love V the most (can't help it trust me) for his soulful voice, his overflowing cuteness and hotness (he is a perfect mixture of both), fashion on point, his does a good job on producing songs too, how he cares for others and the most important thing is he doesn't let others get him down. 

I realized that V doesn't get many lines in most of their songs I am not mad about it either cause I know BTS is a thoughtful group who knows how to appreciate each member but I really wish they didn't cut his scenes in Burn the stage!!! Like I am fairly new and instead of making me appreciate each and every member it made me feel like they are just making him look like a guy who is just rude to other members and if I did not know Taehyung before I am sure after seeing burn the stage I would straight of think that he is rude. And there are few people who wrote mean comments about him like he is just there for shouting or making noises like ""LALALA"" or ""Bow wow wow"" etc. I get so angry about it. It is kinda making me feel like everyone takes him for granted and no one appreciates him and makes me want to ignore BTS as just as any other kpop group. 

He brings lot to the plate! From what I understand he is very smart! He can pull a wide variety of audience towards BTS even though they don't like kpop and being an actor and being friends with actors makes one want to know more about him if they don't know BTS. He is one of the most famous members of the group but you need to remember that even though he gets few lines and most of his scenes gets edited out yet his popularity is on the same level as Jimin and Jungkook (no hate here I love them both).  He is equally known to be handsome along with Jin (both of them are just perfect). Despite all these he always promotes his members first before himself and never gets into pride (how a person be so pure?). His acting is soo good!! I literally cried seeing ""I need you &amp;  Prologues"" videos. He has the ability to move people's heart. 

So please appreciate him more and do not leave any mean comments about him. 

Thanks for hearing me rant I just wanted people to love  V and not hate on him.  ",8,0

This thread is about how to counter problem of Youtube being mass deleted BTS youtube views and likes. Although i am not the one who always streaming BTS videos, i know how hurt it feel when youtube keep deleting BTS views because sometimes i do streaming BTS videos especially during comeback season. 

Youtube is one of biggest platform that let BTS become really popular on social media. They are even featured on one of popular channel finebros many times and also get featured during Top 10 music videos for first 24hour videos. I feel proud that BTS at there and most reactors know BTS. See how impactful Youtube views by allowing general public knowing BTS.

Okay, put aside. What are you guys suggestion in counter the problem? It seem we need to win over the system. Some Army said that once they log out, Youtube deleted their likes. So, i am assuming that youtube auto deleted whoever log out everytime streaming BTS music videos. I really think that BTS being affected the most because its fandom actually that doing the streaming the most like we are using method that been suggested by others purely to help BTS. While for other group, it doesnt matter for viewers as many of them may dont know the method of streaming and just play it and not logging out it. I guess thats why their views not been deleted. I also suggesting that you guys streaming it from hashtags,link, etc regularly so that youtube detected BTS having unique listeners.

So, what you guys think? I am especially concern and excited about upcoming BTS comeback.",4,2

So is Bts a band that writes their own lyrics,wich dont look like theyve been writing by teens and can be about topics like love,political problems or fucked up thigns like the pleasure of killing?

Are they talented enough to do their own backing track and sing without autotune?

Do they have the criativity to on stage just jam some not already written music?

Are they some funny members who can joke on stage and do amazing interviews?

Do they change the feel of their music between albums why keeping the same quality?",3,0

636,2018-8-17,2018,8,17,23,982ksr,Concerns on the recent teasers and the whole HYYH concept,minmang,1534515033,"HYYH really went off really great for the boys because not only they did a concept that was unique at that time, HYYH pt.1 and 2 showed a more clear direction for the boys music-wise and (arguably) their identity that they have established now.

But the recent comebacks esp this one was, imo, kinda went far. Bighit has been milking the whole HYYH concept for 3 years now and created a narrative where each of the boys faces their own struggles. (Although I havent read too deeply into the hyyh notes, the HYYH era ended for me at Young Forever, where it should have ended). Although it's good that they're bringing all these issues into the spotlight, I think it has gone way too far at this point, like for when things kind of blew up with using the queercore collection  


BTS has been known for openly talking about sensitive issues and I think this association with them being ""woke"" led to fans putting meaning in almost every content they put out. While it's good that they're using their popularity to bring awareness to certain issues, I feel like sometimes fans are just way too quick in jumping into conclusions. 

This is dangerous because issues such as mental health, gender equality, and even their criticisms against capitalism are both personal AND societal issues. When you keep on associating the boys with being woke on these things (which made it worse because bighit keeps on extending the hyyh storyline), you are putting the burden on them to reflect all of these (systemic) issues, when in fact, they can because theyre too busy to engage deeply and learn more about the things they are supposed to advocate (for example, they can't possible know about the history and meaning of queercore). The things that helped established their identity and popularity can also backfire on them because if they failed to deliver--either by falling short or misrepresenting the issue, theyre gonna get some backlash, especially from international fans.

I feel like I'm probably one of the few fans who have concerns like this. I'd like to know what yall think as well",82,5

I mean, how prophetic was that letter?! They are now the biggest boy band in the world and they're only going to be even more successful. It just makes me so damn happy :D I'm so proud of them :')

Its a rather bland dish without that sauce. Thankfully, I tried it a different time and really enjoyed it. Ive been to Korean restaurants a number of times now, and have liked trying all the vegetable side dishes.

I have a few questions about getting tickets in Japan for a BTS concert.  
I'm going on a trip there in a few months and it might be my only chance to see them and I'm nervous about the whole thing. I will be there around mid november when they have the osaka stop. 

I've been reading some threads about foreign people going to concerts in Japan but I still have a few questions about it and would appreciate if you could answer them.  
First of all, can I get tickets if I'm not japanese/ don't have a japanese ID or japanese friends who could get them for me? If yes, where and how can I get them? and what would be the price? and when would they go on sale?   
Also another thing thats concerning me, I saw some people saying they were kicked out of the venue because they didn't have japanese ID. What are the chances of that happening and is there a way to avoid it? I wouldnt want to pay for a ticket only to get kicked out D:   
Thats all, I think.

I don't claim to be an expert of any kind (save some knowledge about ancient Chinese fortune telling methods) so this is just an FYI.  Some might not agree with the translations and that's find - Koreans tend to stick with more ancient hanja meanings that is no longer used in modern Chinese. Koreans also tends to care less about the combined meaning of the two hanja as long as it sounds good and seemed auspicious. 

When Korean parents pick names, they usually pick the sound of name they like, such as Soo Jin or Min Ji, then they would go and pick the hanja which has the sounds but carry with it appropriate meaning. Korean govt has a list of hanja which cannot be used in a name, but other than that they can use anything they want.  If the parent's really well-versed in hanja, they would pick their own hanja characters (sign of being well-educated).  If they are not, and after 1970's that's the great majority of Korean population, then they would either ask elders (family or village) or local scholars to give them the hanja, or, most commonly, they would go visit a fortune teller and ask them to help pick the hanja based on a fortune telling technique called Anthroponymy.

Some notes on Chinese Anthroponymy (, ).  This is a popular fortune telling technique used in East Asia (anywhere people use hanzi/hanja/kanji as names) where hanja used in names  are analyzed using order, stroke count, and the 5 elements nature for the purpose of fortune telling or personal compatibility. A popular use are for dating couples to check if their names are compatible for marriage, while others would go and find a new hanja name in hope of changing their fortune.  As you can guess, many parents would use it to pick their baby's names.  This is not as popular now days but from what I can tell Koreans tend to follow the rules of Anthroponymy for hanja names more than other part of East Asia.

Here's some of the meaning behind OT7's name in hanja:

* Jin - :  (seok) = masterful, very/extremely;  (jin) = treasure, precious. ""Extremely Precious"". Jin's dad is well-learned to give have him this name. Very artistic and aristocratic; name fitting for a prince.

* Suga - :  (yun) = type of Jade ornament;  (gi)= others, 3rd person. ""Another precious Jade"".  OK that translation is best I can do since his hanja names are probably picked as result of Anthroponymy based on the sound of ""Yun Gi"".

* J-Hope - :  (ho) = to order, to command; alias;  (seok) = tin (the element), to cherish, adoration. ""Commands Adoration (from others)"".  is a very obvious result of Anthroponymy - the character adds the element of metal to j-hope's name. The name is actually appropriate given how he is today.

* RM - :  (nam) = the South, southern direction;  (joon) = excellence; sharp-minded; handsome. ""The genius or attractive guy from the South"". A patriotic name for a South Korean boy; very fitting for RM.

* Jimin - :  (ji) = wisdom;  (min) = the autumn sky. ""The Wisdom in/of the Autumn Sky"" Wow, such poetry; his parents may just like the sound of Ji Min (very popular sounding name) and looked for meaningful or auspicious hanja with the same sound.

* V - :  (tae) = peace, prosperity, wonder, beauty, the Thai people;  (hyung) = smooth, fortunate, flowing, a boss/rich person. You can get a lot of meaning out of Taehyung's hanja name. A name full of blessing from the elders - probably named by his grandad. A bit old-fashioned.

* Jungkook - :  (jung) = a type of tree called Japanese Spindle;  (kook) = country, nation. ""A nation of Spindle Tree"" LOL... Again  is an Anthroponymy hanja - adds the wood element to Jungkook's fortune.

I'll try to explain the logic of naming Jungkook after a tree. His parents may started off wanting to name him """", which has the same sound Jung Kook but has the meaning of ""Straight-forward/Honorable and Patriotic"", a very good name for a boy. But after they went to the Anthroponymy expert with Jongkook's  (palja, : Taoist fortune telling ""value"" based on birth date &amp; time), the guy might have indicated that JK needed more wood element, so another hanja which looked similar to  but has a tree or wood side radical, , was picked instead. The meaning changed to ""Japanese spindle tree"" but it's close enough that if you can read hanja, you get what it REALLY stands for; plus it has the same sound anyway.

Hope some of you find this interesting",53,281

I also made it through half of Hwarang in 2017 and didn't realise 'Kim Tae-hyung' aka Hansung, was the same person as V of BTS, until an Army right here told me!

Has anyone else had a similar experience of becoming an Army and then realising that you'd seen the boys in something before (however small or random) and simply not registered it at the time? ",142,91

I finally finished compiling a list with quotes and some small notes on each source[**you can view it here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSsgUmbXraRQUJjDGnjBLBDrDIv48kH7vcIq1Ywfk_48cp1ILXvgHn7Vn7pu3nY5FLDsNTu4on1XnCA/pub)**!** I hope that it can be a good resource for casual nerdy reading and/or future academic work on BTS/global media/K-pop fan culture, if any of you decide to pursue such a thing. (Psst...If you're going to look at anything, I *highly* recommend taking a look at [this paper](http://ijaps.usm.my/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Art1-Gitzen.pdf) and also [this paper](http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/300/287). Both are fascinating and shed light on the unique fan/celebrity relationships in K-idol culture!)



So that's that, but I was wonderinghave any of you (students, academics, or otherwise) stumbled across any papers or concepts or ideas or models in your studies that *really* reminded you of some aspects of the BTS phenomenon? I really hope this isn't too much of an obscure discussion question, but I was hoping we could share some knowledge and insights!",28,117

I *love* them and they are my most favourite group of musicians of all time. Theyre so great that I can spend days watching their MVs, Vlives, compilations, interviews, and so on. But I think thats exactly why it is important for us as fans to be a little introspective and determine whether we are addicted and are being hurt by our obsession. If youve ever had even a fleeting thought that you may be addicted to BTS, I beg you to read at least a little of the following and consider whether you have an addiction.

&amp;nbsp;

**Streaming**



Streaming is a big part of the Kpop fandom, but it can get obsessive at times and I not only feel like its harmful for us, but we could be negatively affecting BTS as well.

&amp;nbsp;

First of all, streaming takes up a lot of time. While, of course, you could just use the playlist method and do something else, ARMYs have still spent and continue to spend time researching the best methods, sharing them, etc. Streaming has become such a big thing that it has almost become a job for some of us and we may even gain a sense of purpose from this. But in reality, we arent doing anything that great, we arent achieving our dreams or any important goals and we arent gaining any skills either. One of their recent MVs that hit a view count milestone was Dope, and verses in that song talk about how hard they had to work to become who they are, while those who cant seem to find success keep failing because they arent *trying*. Im absolutely sure that the boys would want to be good role models, so wouldnt it be a better idea to watch their MVs every once in a while when we feel like it and spend more time working on our dreams instead of streaming and constantly checking whether the videos are playing fine?


&amp;nbsp;

Secondly, I also feel like streaming can do more harm than good to BTS. I know that a lot of people stream in order to bring more attention to their amazing music, but there are a few ways this doesnt work out as planned. Ill use 3 of the most popular kpop songs in terms of views to show my first reason. Fire and DNA as well as TT by Twice have racked up 100s of millions of views and both of our fandoms are pretty big on streaming. But if you take a look at the comments, a very large portion of them are about streaming, views, and praise for ARMYs for reaching milestones rather than the actual music or video. 8/15 of DNAs top comments are about views, 13/15 of Fires top comments are about views, and 11/15 of TTs top comments are about views. Imagine you werent a kpop fan and came across these massively popular videos. If someone new were to see all these comments about streaming and views, it could not only confuse them and push them away from the fandom, it could lead them to believe that a lot of the views come from streaming instead of the music being genuinely good.


&amp;nbsp;

And thats the other problem with streaming, it doesnt actually support them. Its not a secret that each member of BTS is passionate about the music they create. They make meaningful messages and explore various genres, so its clear that they arent just trying to make music for money. So these extra views that streaming gets them mean nothing. The more we stream, the more the view count becomes just simple numbers instead of the amount of people who liked the music enough to stay around and potentially felt something deep. And more views doesnt mean a song is better than those with less views. Despacito has more views than many BTS MVs combined, but I like every last one of BTSs songs better. When we make these view milestones seem so grand, I feel like its just a way to make ourselves and our actions feel important, so again, to gain purpose. But we cant gain purpose through this, so let the boys rise through pure talent, and let the views mean something. And hey, the guys work under a small company and debuted in 2013, when dozens of other groups had their starts and quick failures, yet their talent and teamwork made them the biggest international Korean act of all time. We dont need to fabricate their popularity. They can do great things through sheer talent alone.


&amp;nbsp;



**Spending too much time on BTS**

&amp;nbsp;


Id like to end on a more general point. My summer break is coming to an end soon, and I havent achieved any of the goals I had set for myself at the beginning. I spent days binging kpop and BTS stuff and put in no effort to care for myself. Ive let myself down just like I have for every other break and opportunity over the past few years. I really want to achieve my dreams, but Im just so addicted to entertainment, and for BTS to provide not only that, but be exactly what I want to be in life, its so difficult to let go. A lot of the time, these things helped me avoid dealing with the problems in my life, but we need to realize that its not actually making us happy. I need to overcome this because I love myself.


&amp;nbsp;

The boys have been telling us this for a while now, but we need to love ourselves, and obsessing over them to a harmful degree, while telling ourselves were enjoying it isnt love. Its fake love. So if you feel the same way, please join me in trying to learn how we can truly love ourselves. Im not saying we should abandon BTS at all, just tone it down a lot. Do continue to support them, buy their music, listen to it, tell people about how awesome they are, but dont lend your lives to them under the lie that its support. We can support ourselves and BTS at the same time. 


&amp;nbsp;

The release of LY: Answer is going to make it easier to fall deeper into addiction, but we dont have to let ourselves trip. Find something to do that has nothing to do with BTS. If youve had an idea for a book or screenplay, then write it, if you like to draw, then keep drawing, and if youre passionate about music, then make music of your own. And if it helps, you can just put on their music while you work, but we need to use our time for other things as well. Although it sucks, admitting to and overcoming our addictions is a huge part of loving ourselves, so we need to try our absolute best.


&amp;nbsp;


But we can do it, were good enough :)

From [Anthony M. Ludovici's Preface of Nietzsche's Twilight of the Idols](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52263/52263-h/52263-h.htm),

&gt;Of *The Twilight of the Idols,* Nietzsche says in *Ecce Homo* (p. 118):""If anyone should desire to obtain a rapid sketch of how everything before my time was standing on its head, he should begin reading me in this book. That which is called 'Idols' on the title-page is simply the old truth that has been believed in hitherto. In plain English, *The Twilight of the Idols* means that the old truth is on its last legs.""

One of such old truths I want to highlight here is briefly explored in the section Morality as Anti-Nature (translation by Walter Kaufmann [here](https://www.commonlit.org/texts/morality-as-anti-nature)). Nietzsche admits to the disastrous powers of excess passion, but criticizes the moralist approach of castrating immoderate passion completely from a person. What he espouses in turn is ""the spiritualization of sensuality"" or what he calls love.

&gt; We others, we immoralists, have, conversely, made room in our hearts for every kind of understanding, comprehending, and approving. We do not easily negate; we make it a point of honor to be affirmers. More and more, our eyes have opened to that economy which needs and knows how to utilize everything that the holy witlessness of the priest, the diseased reason in the priest, rejects  that economy in the law of life which finds an advantage even in the disgusting species of the prigs, the priests, the virtuous. What advantage? But we ourselves, we immoralists, are the ***answer***. 

Hermann Hesse is known to have been greatly influenced by Nietzsche and it is said that many of the ideas expressed in *Demian*, which *Wings* heavily leans on, were borrowed from Nietzsche's work. To wit, I see a lot what is outlined under Morality as Anti-Nature in *Demian* (rejection of the good versus evil binary). That being said, could IDOL be a Nietzsche influenced track? If so, what idols do you think BTS will challenge in Answer?",9,98

Our mod team has been ~~(playing skribblio)~~ hard at work preparing for the comeback this time around too. Similar to the Tear comeback, we are here with this big informational post to tell you of all those sweet threads well be posting. Lets not commit a Big Miss Steak posting in the wrong places so your beautiful, handsome, amazing mod team doesnt look like headless chickens amidst a huge amount of removed comments and threads.

The main way were gonna do this is - ya guessed it, smarty pants - ***M E G A T H R E A D S***. 

There will soon be a silly amount of content flooding in, so before submitting anything, please make sure its not better suited for one of these instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Dont make me stain my beautiful face with tears.

#I. Love Yourself: ANSWER Comeback Hype Thread  

This is where you go with your **strong feelings**. This thread will be posted about three hours before the release. A free-for-all thread for pre-release hype and immediate post-release emotion dump.

---

#II. ANSWER Achievements Megathread  

**See past examples:** [WINGS Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/), [YNWA Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/), [HER Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/).

---

#IV. ANSWER Radio Play Megathread  

**See past example:** [HER Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/)

---

#V. ANSWER English Press Coverage Megathread  

Here is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. 

**Important Note:** If its from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or dont have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    

---

#VI. SNS Mentions Megathread  

Here is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc. when this album drops!  

**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone like Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread. (Come through this time, B.)  

**Important Note II:** BTS tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be *compiled into one self-post compilation* [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/).

--- 

#VII. ANSWER - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread  

This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream TEAR (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. 

Well try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys help to tell us since we dont know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  

This thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. **Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since its for more thoughtful discussion.**   

---

#VIII. Music Show Voting Megathread  

**See past examples:** [YNWA Music Show Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5thmw4/how_to_help_bts_win_on_music_shows_billboard_100/), [HER Music Show Megathread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/).   

---

#IX. Compilation Redirect Gigathread  

The behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be **stickied** and contain links to *all* the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  

--- 


##X. Discord Server  

Dont forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.  You can get a better feel of how Discord works in [this beautiful, sexy tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yuT8_GlIiGWDbyT_x6hpMXpsSV546tMPlzDEYQqG3Vg/edit?usp=sharing) written by your handsome Tech Support.

These threads are going to be manually posted by your truly ravishing, modest mods *(weeps)*, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated.  

If we notice any other one type of content drowning the sub, well dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for gods sake, please remember that **compilations are always better than individual submissions** when it comes to a batch of similar content!

If for whatever reason you are still confused as to when the comeback will be, **[check out this link with a sweet timezone converter](https://notime.zone/LKXRwZnAWTx-u)**. 

Note that usually the VLive starts 1h before the actual comeback, but last time it was 2h before, ending 1h before the album and MV drop.

Do we have a good shot snatching that #1 spot for the 2nd time? They just released a ""retro"" teaser that basically meant Korean Joseon Era type of retro. It would be so damn cool if they'll have another #1 album, given the song just screams KOREAN and ASIAN. What a time to be alive being an Asian in 2018 and seeing these men so proud of their roots representing a part of me. This is honestly just beyond Bangtan for me now, I would cry so hard if they land on #1 spot, it would mean so much.",56,108

Let's talk business since this is coming quite late.

[](#v_ayy)

#I. New Theme

As those of you on desktop must've noticed, we just changed the subreddit's theme to match the new album coming out. I apologise for the delay.

For those of you on mobile, this is what the new theme looks like:

* [Day mode](https://i.imgur.com/I5UsAfC.png);
* [Night mode](https://i.imgur.com/YRVfdoR.png).

-

^(thanks /u/randomneeess for helping with screenshots).

-

To switch to night mode, you will need to be on the classic/old reddit and have [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) installed. [Here is how you can turn it on](https://i.imgur.com/ZjW6psb.gif).

Reminder that you can check out all past themes in our [layout archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/layouts) in the wiki.

-

**Also, a tip for newbies:** You can go to the subreddit's frontpage by clicking on the ""ANSWER"" logo in the header or by clicking the BTS image in the sidear. For reddit's frontpage, click on the ARMYBomb Snoo :\^)

---

#II. Emojis

The subreddit emojis are not currently working. This is because I'll be revamping them after the comeback.

Sorry, folks.

Expect some new ones soon, though!

---

#III. [Doubt (x)](https://i.imgur.com/8QEgPgt.png)

As I'm sure you've noticed, the flairs and icons to certain posts have changed. While I was quite excited about this, now I'm not so sure. 

I'd like to ask your opinions on whether I should keep it like this or change it back to the way it was. I know some of us (me included) relied on the flairs being before the title, but I thought I'd try something new for the sub.

Please tell me if you find any issues with the theme, too.

---

#IV. A Few Reminders

If you are new to the subreddit or just reddit in general, please remember these:

As I was thinking about theconcert, I was thinking about all of the things I need to take into consideration: Arrival time. Buying merch. What the crowd is like. What to expect overall. I quickly realized that this will be the first time I will be attending a concert of this calibur, and I am not totally sure how to approach it.   


I know a lot of advice depends on location (for reference, I will be at the Staples Center in LA),  but any advice from people who have previously attended a Bangtan concert to help people new to seeing them is welcomed! Feel free to list the venue you attended as well as it may help people better understand your advice.  


* **How early should someone arrive to a BTS concert?**   
*I know people tend to show up to major concerts early regardless, but I have still yet to witness the power of ARMY all together IRL. I want to be prepared for what to expect and plan ahead to arrive early if it will be insane to get in. :)*   

* **How difficult is it to buy merch?**   
*Does it get sold out quickly? Do they always tend to have enough to go around?*  

* **Do they tend to sell light sticks at the show?**   
*Is it better to buy online?*   

* **Is there any other advice for a Bangtan concert newbie to take into consideration?**  
*Any advice is helpful and can better prepare people for this event! Anything that you learned after going to one or experiences you had would be wonderful to hear.* 

Hopefully this can help a lot of ARMYs with their prep for the concert. :) Let's discuss!

I know they have a world tour coming up and it wont be until next year where it would truly be the finale, however it will be a while before they release anything new. (Unless we have another mixtape that someone will drop soon.) I became an ARMY a but after Wings: You Never Walk Alone released and I barely missed the reactions of the fans during the end of the Youth series. So, I wanted to ask those who were fans during the School and Youth trilogy how you felt when the last album dropped. 

In a sense, I feel relieved that there even is a conclusion. I know we might not receive all the answers that we are looking for with the abundant amount of questions we have about the BTS Universe, but we will most likely receive something that will give a little satisfaction, right(?) However, I also feel a bit sad that this beautiful trilogy is ending. It has been a significant part of my years in college and as I started to transition onto a different part of life, Ive been reflecting a lot on how they inspired me in different ways. But at the same time, I am excited for whats next for BTS. Whether its another trilogy or something different, I cant wait!

I initially launched BTS Kingdom here in July and got plenty of good advice from you. When I first started working on it I barely even knew how to program or even design a website...
But ever since then, after hearing your advice I did my best to improve BTS Kingdom as much as I could and I think the results paid off, check it out for yourself:
https://btskingdom.com/

The design is much improved, I'm so proud of myself. Yes, I'm the only one doing everything, with just some help from friends.
This is the only ARMY website that has BTS Korean study materials (that I wrote), Korean culture related articles, plenty of memes and a BTS meme generator!
I hope that by creating BTS Kingdom I contributed to BTS and help everyone get to know BTS and Korean culture/language better. ^.^
And now that BTS are releasing a new album, I will be publishing Korean culture/language related articles about their new album as well.
I already published one about the recent teaser, check it out - https://btskingdom.com/articles/180822.html

Thank you so much for your support and please let me know your honest thoughts about it. Every single advice will contribute to BTS Kingdom 3.0. ^^

919,2018-8-24,2018,8,24,9,99so0z,Twas The Night Before Comeback: a final poem,Caledonia_Plaid,1535069554,"  

Twas the night before comeback, when all through the cosmos,  
The stars were aligning for seven boys, almost  
prepared to dispatch what would Answer the queries -  
the final release of the Love Yourself series.  
And all of the ARMYs, the old and the new,  
had gathered to listen, discuss and review,  
in one special place, a diverse social hub:  
The forum of Bangtan (the best Reddit sub).  

  
Our love for the boys is what brought us this way,  
the sense of community made us all stay,  
Sometimes in agreement and sometimes at odds,  
and all of it managed by wonderful mods.  
As posts were upvoted and fan art admired,  
I read through it all and again was inspired,  
to capture the moment, if I may impose,  
And humbly attempt to commit it to prose.  

  
So back to before, to the comeback in Spring,  
when BTS in the US was a thing,  
Promotions for Love Yourself: Tear were a dream,  
It seemed breaking records was that comebacks theme,  
They debuted at Billboard and won once again,  
On SNS people asked Who are these men?!  
Global stars flocked to them just to say hey,  
could this still be our group of seven baepsae?  

  
But no longer nugu, no longer ignored,  
They aimed for the clouds and then BTS soared,  
And all of the while staying humble and fun,  
Feeding ARMYs with content like VLives and Run,  
The interview footage did more than suffice,  
giving us classics like Jimin, you nice!  
And then they went back to place where theyre from,  
to celebrated 5 years with ARMY, at prom.  

  
Tear got to 1, Fake Love made the top 10,  
Our dear Minstradamus was right once again,  
So many events that require addressing,  
From songs going gold, to John Cena obsessing,  
And things so outlandish youd think they were fake,  
(Hoseok made it into an MV by Drake?!)  
And later a final tour date was revealed:  
a stadium show, held in Mets CitiField!  

  
And just as new ARMYs were settling in,  
they learned all the names from Jungkook up to Jin,  
the videos stopped! No more tweets, no more news,  
They found themselves plagued by the content drought blues,  
The boys were in Saipan enjoying the sun,  
(well all except Suga, who finds sleeping fun),
But this time we neednt have suffered too long,  
for on the horizon was one special song,  
And what should appear, to relieve all our stress,  
a notification from YouTube no less...  

  
We looked at the text and we let out a shout,  
The beautiful Jintro was finally out!  
Hes the one he should love, but we all loved him too,  
His voice and his visuals turned ARMYs to goo,  
The melody soared and the lyrics were deep,  
The beauty of Jin could make anyone weep,  
And just as we picked ourselves up off the ground,  
The track list and concepts were soon to be found.  

  
The looks were flamboyant, the photos intense,  
And many an ARMY were quite on the fence,  
But no one could argue they didnt look great,  
The hype began building, we all couldnt wait!  
The teaser for IDOL, with style oh so hot,  
They promised us retro and retro we got!  
But no one predicted that this was their mission,  
Merging African beats with Korean tradition.  

  
Our hearts begin racing, the time has arrived,  
We got through the waiting, of course we survived,  
The charts will be topped, records crushed with a bang!  
Expectations surpassed, haters met with a ddaeng!  
And all of this thanks to Bangtan and their fans,  
Who walk on the flower path, all holding hands,  
So good luck to all, now my poem shall cease,  
Happy Comeback! And Love Yourself, Love Myself, peace!  

  

  

Note: Happy Comeback, friends. This is my last comeback poem of this era. If you would like to read the previous two they are here and here. Im so so excited for the rest of the year!!! Hope everyone has a great time, hope to see you at Citifield or Prudential Center! Fighting!

Oh my lawd. I feel like a one of those YouTubers or influencers... heehee! But theres no catch to this. You dont have to follow or like anything. 

My sisters and I were lucky enough to swing tickets for the Love Yourself Tour and Im feeling super giddy. And by extension, I want to get an ARMY out there an ARMY BOMB Ver. 3! 

To choose a lovely ARMY to give the ARMY Bomb to, just leave me your Bangtan Story! (I love reading peoples stories. :)) How did you get into Bangtan? Bias? Favorite song? Performance? How have they touched your life? How much has this Love Yourself Series influenced you to love yourself? 

Of course, you dont have to answer all those questions and you could totally just answer one and roll with it! 

Just a few things, though: 

1. Ill leave this open to all yall, regardless of whether ur going to the world tour or just want to have a piece of Bangtan memorabilia! 

2. Ill keep this open until Wednesday, September 6, and thats when Ill choose a winner. 

3. Dont give me any personal information on this thread, please! Safety first! Ill Direct Message you to get details if I choose you :) ",68,40

Also, he kind of kept his cool throughout the whole thing and even though he admitted in the interview afterwards that he indeed was scared, he was good at hiding his feelings. He didn't get emotional like Jungkook. (Not that it's a bad thing.)

However I've seen so many people that follow BTS, EXO, BlackPink and a whole lot of others, but kpop in general that are just plain toxic and run around acting like children screaming at each other. I'm new to kpop and only started listening to BTS about 2 months ago and am now hooked but why the heck is it like so many fans of these bands just seem to want to destroy the genre from the inside because of some weird af reasons ? Imagine how much more popular this would be if the majority of these people acted like mature humans.

Also on a side note; what the hell is with people bombarding kpop groups at airports ? If you actually liked the group you'd be a little more polite I'd think.

Thanks to anyone who reads this and is able to help me understand this madness. 

Love yall

Please write down your favorite song lyric with the name of the song from either LY Her or LY Tear that you have found to be deeply profound to you.

I've kept everything in pristine condition, and will send it to you in the same way. You may ask me a couple of questions via dm about it if you like, and I'll answer as best I can. There are a lot of photocards, most of them rare and some extremely rare, and albums included as well. Hence the price will not be cheap. You will get exactly the value that you pay for, no more and no less. I accept payment in both USD and GBP. Short term payment plans are accepted. Please dm me if you're interested in adopting :) I can provide proof of past sales as well upon request \^\^",9,0

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, shoutout to u/diminie and u/wishawisha for English translations. How would we survive without you?

In trying to get as close as I can to the Korean lyrics, I was wondering if there's information on where to find good translations in other languages? In particular, I'm looking for them in **Chinese.** I know there are official ones at [UNIVERSAL MUSIC TAIWAN ](https://www.youtube.com/user/universaltwn), but they only have 8 of the music videos uploaded. 

So, calling all fellow Chinese speakers, where do you go for BTS song lyrics?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, would some sort of official thread be helpful? Like a compilation of known translators for each language? Or is that overkill? 

If you speak another language, feel free to share! :)",5,52

As a long time BTS fan and contemporary art lover, I was ecstatic when I saw either a direct collaboration or strong influences with Nick Cave's artistic work in the BTS IDOL MV yesterday, and I hadn't seen anyone talking about it so here I am!

So, were you confused and amazed by the awesome, colorful suits that some people were wearing during the MV, especially the ""shaggy"" ones near the end? I immediately recognized them as [Nick Cave's Soundsuits!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpNcmh3rxko) So, who is Nick Cave? He's an African American sculptor, dancer, and performance artist. [He first created the Soundsuits as a ""type of armor that protected him from profiling by concealing race, gender, and class.""](http://fristartmuseum.org/calendar/detail/nick-cave) The artist also hoped that his art would ""provide a transformative place where your narrative can be featured and your dreams can soar."" I think this message, and of course the bright, whimsical imagery of the suits, goes very hand and hand with the concept of ""IDOL."" The boys talk about in their lyrics how they have ""They are hundred's of me inside of me/I'm facing a new me again today/It's all me anyway."" Also, there's J-Hope's verse where he mentions the movie [""Face Off""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ql_stry_2#synopsis) where a guy literally replaces his face with that of another. 

I think when a lot of people think of idols, they think they have this sort of ""mask"" or ""shield"" that they use to protect themselves from the world and the critics. Unlike in FAKE LOVE where the mask was a negative thing, I think BTS decided to use Cave's work because the message of ""IDOL"" is that even the masks that BTS wear and show through their performances are still a form of self-expression and art.

Namjoon sums it up the best in the very start of the song: ""You can call me artist/You can call me idol/No matter what you call me/I don't care/I'm proud of it.""

&amp;#x200B;

When the Love Yourself Tour announced their U.S. shows I told myself they weren't showing anywhere close to where I live and it wasn't economical to spend boat loads of money on tickets along with travel and accommodations, you know, adult things. The tickets went up for sale and the tickets went and I didn't buy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now all the videos of the live cams are coming out and I'm slowly realizing what a once in a lifetime thing the Love Yourself Tour will be, and all of my favorite, favorite songs that I love so much and the performances along with it and their beautiful voices and their real life faces and all the magic I will never get to be a part of.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. I'm crying and I don't know why. Being a broke twenty year old living on my own is hard, and I feel dumb calling my family or friends sobbing because I'll never get to see my favorite band perform live. I feel like I'm just watching something absolutely incredible from the outside that I'll never have the chance to be a part of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else feeling like this right about now?

Basically this time last year I was a very different person. I was suffering with anxiety and depression so bad that I could barely step foot outside my house without having a panic attack. I couldnt even get in my car and drive down the road at one point. I had to give up my job and my personal relationships became strained due to me being too afraid to go anywhere or do anything. I remember one night sitting in bed at 3am just crying and wondering whether this would be my life forever.

Then I discovered BTS. Now Ive *never* been someone who was interested in boy bands, but as soon as I saw them and read their lyrics I was hooked. Everything about them was completely different to any type of music or artist that Ive been into before, but I completely fell down the rabbit hole. Then I discovered Yoongis mixtape, (specifically his song The Last) and I could relate to his feelings so much. To know that someone of his status and someone with his lifestyle could be feeling just a little bit of how I was feeling made me feel... less alone. 

Fast forward a year (plus therapy and anti depressants) and Im pretty much living a normal life and feeling AMAZING. Dont get me wrong, I still have days where I dont feel so great and it hasnt been easy, but Im so proud of how far Ive come. Im going to see the boys in London in October which is a *huge* thing for me as I have never been able to deal with crowds or the public very well, but Im doing it.

BTS have given me something to look forward to, theyve helped me realise that Im a human being and that everyone goes through rough times but we will all get there in the end.

I used to be a person who followed the crowd, someone who would just follow trends to be like everyone else and someone who was so desperate to be liked and accepted, but I am so much more open minded and accepting of different music, cultures, people and interests now. I dont know one single person in real life who is interested in BTS (my friends think Im totally weird - but love me regardless lol), but I fully embrace it and dont care what people think anymore. Ive decided to start learning Korean and just have so many things I want to do with my life now. 

Sorry for rambling but I wanted to write my feelings down and just wondered if anyone else had anything to share?? X

I'm a big-time fan of these beautiful boys, and I have a question about their MVs. I've noticed that in both DNA and now Idol that the HD quality varies throughout the videos. Like some parts of Idol and DNA are really really crisp and HD but other parts are all pixel-y. I don't mean the purposeful glitch effects. And my internet is super fast and consistent so I don't think that's it, especially since the same points on the video have been lower definition every time I watch them.

I just don't understand how or why or what the motivation would be for Big Hit to make the videos in lower definition than possible. Do you know what I'm talking about, and do you have  idea why this might be? Is it intentional? Why can't we see the boys in beautiful HD every second of every video??? ",13,50

I'm going to record all the REAL instruments next week for a video(these are just sounds from my computer).

I hope you like it. IF you have any feedback or constructive criticism, please let me know. I'm really excited about this and I hope the A.R.M.Y. Will give it a chance. Much love.

Things like this have never bothered me, I live in Kenya no one ever comes to tour here and when they do come it's to ""see the children"". I've also never really known whether I would like concerts anyway; crowds can usually trigger anxiety for me, but I've always wanted to experience things live. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the whole thing is bothering me now because I really care for BTS and I've seen videos of them on music shows and from their Wings tour so I also know full well what I'm missing out on. This is also the my first comeback where they've gone on tour after, so these are new feelings

1188,2018-8-27,2018,8,27,11,9al9ch,Tips for not getting scammed when buying BTS tickets online,yy1997,1535336983,"How not to get scammed while buying BTS tickets (or any concert tickets): 
1. The payment method: when buying tickets from strangers online ALWAYS USE PAYPAL GOODS AND SERVICES!! if the seller says they cant accept payment through PayPal g/s then most likely its a scam unless they are willing to meet in public with you. Many times the seller will make up an excuse as to why they cant accept PayPal but do not be swayed by their lies and pay them through ZELLE, VENMO, or GOOGLE PAY because these do not have fraud protection and you will not get your money back once you send it to the scammer. Also do not send half of the ticket cost to the seller and then send the other half after you get the ticket through anything other than PayPal goods and services. If you think that sending half the amount will be safe using VENMO, ZELLE, GOOGLE PAY, or etc. you are wrong because the scammer will just take that amount and run and you wont get your tickets.

2. The proof: the most obvious is asking the seller for a picture of the ticket whether physical or electronic. However, scammers find pictures online and reuse them to scam people. If its a physical ticket, I would ask them to use a post it and write the time and your social media name on it. It assures you that they have their ticket on hand with them. If its a electronic ticket, ask them for a screenshot of the ticket with the time shown on it right away and send it to you. Its okay if their time is a few minutes apart from the time you asked them for the proof but if its way off then I would says its sketchy. In addition to this, for electronic tickets, you should also ask for an email confirmation of their ticket purchase with their name on it

3. The price: honestly people get scammed easily when they see a ticket at face value or even lower than face value. I like to follow the rule of face value + fees = possible real ticket. The reason why is because genuine sellers do not want to lose profit. So selling a GA or P1 ticket at $250 would lose them at least $20-$30. Im not saying that the GA tickets at $250 or lower are fake, Im just trying to make buyers think in a genuine sellers point of view. In the case of face value tickets with no fees to are cheaper than face value, I would ask the seller a few question related to BTS before considering buying them. Also dont ask very easy questions that anyone can find on Wikipedia. Ask questions that only an ARMY would know. 

*** THINGS TO DO BEFORE EVEN THINKING ABOUT BUYING THE TICKET: 
1. Go and look through the sellers social media feed (especially if its on twitter and reddit). Scroll through and see if they even like BTS. Dont be fooled by their header picture! If they retweet some BTS related things very recently and their past feed is not about BTS at all, I would say this seller is a bit sketchy. I know some people make an account just to sell their BTS ticket which is fine but during situations like this ask them a few BTS related questions and see how they respond. If they dont know how to answer any of them I would say its a bit sketchy. 
2. I dont remember where I saw this, but many of the fake ticket screen shots have this yellow mark in them that was used to cover sensitive information. So I would be cautious of that if the seller sends a proof like that. 

Alright, these are all the tips I can think of right now but if you have any question feel free to ask it in the comments! I will try to help as much as I can! I hope you all find real tickets and get to see our boys LIVE!

For tear we mostly got positive reviews, even pitchfork gave it a 7.1. Most reviewer stated that the biggest problem with tear was it's consistency issues and how some songs aren't really all that related to the theme of the album. With answer I think they dealt with the consistency issue rather well but on the other hand their songs are getting a more divisive reaction. Some people like idol a lot and other dislike it even among the army so I was wondering how it would effect the critics.

Also please share your own opinion about the album, do you like it ? Or is it just ok?

Also please don't unnecessarily down vote someone, if you don't agree with them then discuss it instead of down voting their comment.",31,42

The lyrics to namjoon's verse sounded oddly familiar, so I went searching for the lyrics for both songs and did a side-by-side comparison, after which I discovered this piece of literary genius... (I colour-coded the matching parts for easier reference  basically joon's verse in I'm Fine is ""flipped"" from his verse in Save Me)

&amp;#x200B;

I was one of the lucky fans to get their hands on a BTS Citi Field ticket for their concert on October 6th. I was originally planning to go with my friend, who also got a ticket. However, it turns out that both of our parents can not attend the concert due to the events they have on that day, and we both have no older siblings. We are old enough to not do completely idiotic stuff and follow strangers in cars, but we are also not yet 16, which could potentially be a problem. While doing research on the concert, I came across a site (was NOT the official concert site) that stated that you had to be 16 to enter the concert without a legal guardian, and that there was an ID check at the entrance. It is important to mention that I did not find this information anywhere else, not even on the official site. I have attached pictures of the statements made by the website. I have no idea if this is a trustworthy site or not for information, and I have my doubts. However, airing on the side of caution, I have decided to ask around. After all, it would suck getting hyped up to finally see BTS, only to get turned away at the entrance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if this information is actually correct, and I should start looking for people who will go with me? Thank you very much!

I've joined the fan club already, and tried to enter the lottery for tickets yesterday after the lottery period started.

&amp;#x200B;

However, every time I got to the screen where it asks you to enter your email and phone number (before the captcha thing where you drag the object into the box), it crashed and said the server was too busy.

&amp;#x200B;

I only tried once for about three separate dates and kept getting the same message.

&amp;#x200B;

So I figured I would try again today. Now I can get up to the captcha, but once I complete it and click through, the site gives me a message saying I've applied too many times. I haven't even finished a single lottery application for any of the dates because it keeps crashing so I have no clue why it's giving me that response. 

&amp;#x200B;

Super frustrated and not sure what to do :/ Has anyone else had any luck entering the lottery?

Theyve given me courage that I can take risks and speak up because I might lose friends but I wont lose BTS. Theyve formed a supportive platform of family that I can always talk to when Im overwhelmed by life. 

How can I thank them for it? Because I always buy their albums and merch, but BTS are rich already and after a point, more money doesnt make you happy. I stream and promote their albums but again, theyre already famous and accomplished. I donate to their charity campaign and always try to be a well-behaved fan that doesnt cause them problems. 

It feels like something I cant really repay them for. And I feel like Ill go my whole life thinking ah, Im thankful BTS existed. But then we hear things like how they gave up vacation days to perform for fans on music shows, and suddenly I really want to make them happy and show them how much we appreciate how hard they work.

1280,2018-8-28,2018,8,28,18,9axgny,What if each member were a romantic leading man?,princessdootdoot,1535448815,"**If you were to cast the boys as the Leading Man in a romance, what would be their story?**

Okay. So I was just watching [this ](https://youtu.be/EMuvZg8koao) reaction to Epiphany and the whole time, while the reactors described Jins voice and singing, I kept agreeing and also thinking about the kind of Male Romantic Lead Jin would be and what his movie/shows story would be about. I then started formulating a situation for each member and went on an imagination spiral. 

Heres mine: 

Jin:
Seokjin feels like home to me, so I definitely see him as the lead of a quiet and slightly heart breaking romance where a couple who has been married for a few years are only now going through the motions. They have to try to fall in love with each other again or they may fall apart. Jin is the wholesome husband and he takes care of his spouse endlessly and cant wrap his head around his marriage falling apart. He believes they are still golden while his spouse is slowly falling out of love with him and he struggles to hold on. The soundtrack will be acoustic, melancholy coffee house and beautiful piano.  There will be a lot of moody and quiet shots 

Yoongi: 
I think Sugas romance movie will be one where he meets his love interest again after theyve left their small town. Hes still the rough and tough seeming guy and his love interest is now a big city hot shot with a secret. Theyre failing out in the big wide world and the small town theyre from still thinks theyre a hit. Suga will find out the secret and instead of spreading the news, he reaches the love interest to remember where they came from. They do all the dumb and wreck less teenager things they used to do in their small town and Suga learns to dream bigger and the love interest learns to remember their roots. 

Hoseok:
Okay, J-Hope is the summer love story that doesnt want to end. He is a young university student who begins a relationship with his love interest for the summer. They have the brightest and wildest adventures, but as summer winds down and they have to return to their real lives, they dont want to let go, but also dont know how they could hold on. So, J-Hope devises a plan.  The story follows them throughout their months apart and how they send each other sweet gifts and messages about their summer memories and planning new ones. Its a sweet and sunny love story with the antagonist as the miles of space between the characters. 

Namjoom:
Okay, so for some reason I imagine RMs love story as a cancer one? Hes a med student interning at a hospital. His love interest is the darling of the in-patients and theyre not afraid of their condition and impending death. The love interest is smitten with RM and used to actually be in his Bio 101 class before becoming terminally ill. He slowly becomes a regular in their routine and they both slowly fall in love, silently struggling with the eventual end of their love. I imagine this one with a lot of streams of sunshine and gentle smiles and also sad and quiet nights. 

Jimin: 
So Jimin is the best friend turned lover.  His love interest is always searching for someone else. Theyve been best friends since a hilarious mishap at a house party and hes been in love with said person for a bit of time now. I think he would also have a bit of a Ferris Beuler vibe with a very relatable kind of comedy to the whole thing. Or if youve watched The Duff, it might be like that. In the end, Jimin decides to just move on and he sees hes better off just taking care of himself, and suddenly the love interest sees his true light and itll end in a bit of a cliff hanger. 

Taehyung: 
V s story is a noona one I think. Hes a young artist in a foreign country. He lives the transitory life, back-packing places and just making art. Hes a free sprit. Then, he meets his love interest who is older and a bit of a square. He paints her and gives her the painting. They end up meeting on the same bench for a month almost every other day. V promises he is leaving soon, but he never does. His love interest asks why he never just settles down and he gives them the Audrey Hepburn Breakfast at Tiffanys answer. So, he and his love interest decide to part ways and a few years later, V is a little older and a little wiser and they meet again. They are in the same city, V has made it as an artist and his love interest has decided to be more free with life. Like Jimins, it will be a cliff hanger.  

Jungkook: 
Ahhh... I see Jungkook as the lead in a high school love story, a coming of age. Hes a popular athlete, hes got a reputation, but actually, hes quite inexperienced in many things that hes popular for. He meets his love interest, the quirky kid, at a house party and they decide to show Jungkook the ropes. He discovers all these things and he falls in love for the first time. But when its time to leave, hes got a scholarship in some far off college. His love interest tells him theyll meet again and Jungkook leaves, bitter sweet. They never do meet again, but he learns a lot and becomes his own man. Itll have a bit of an indie vibe to it. 

So, yeah. Thats what Ive got. How about you?",54,80

I think Epiphany has just amazing build-up and song structure, and it really is just an anthem. I could say the same about Serendipity, but it honestly took a bit to grow on me.

This is Big Hit's stance. Anything more or less than what is listed here should be discerned by the individual fan. There are of course fan groups that spread movements with additional guidelines, but that's your choice to make.

I personally think it is ridiculous to have to censor a word that isn't actually a bad word, but after a year in retail I have approx. no faith left in humanity. I also don't want my co-workers who aren't  familiar with Korean language, to get stuck in awkward situations. 

Anyone got any tips? (I just want to spread the bangtan love to as many people as possible!)",10,50
