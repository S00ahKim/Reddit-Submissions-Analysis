Many of us had a chance to collectively freak out in real-time over the EPIC performance from the boys at MMA and lord was that comment thread moving *fast*!  

I thought maybe we could use a separate space to discuss the stage in more detail after some reflection (or after catching up on the performance if you didnt see it live).  

[Heres a link to the legendary performance itself](https://youtu.be/e-hX9w8M7hI)  

  

For me it was one of the best awards stages Ive ever seen (and Ive been a fan of awards shows since I was a kid) - and they all completely blew me away.  
Some thoughts that Ive been having since this morning:  

- Holy shit am I proud of Park Jimin. His voice was so. fucking. stable. As a trained singer I always catch myself analyzing vocal performances and picking up on flaws, but our Jiminie was on point. He focused his breathing and was able to stay in tune and consistent for the entire performance, which when you consider how hard they were ALL going on the choreo its really damn impressive.  

- They have all truly become stars on the stage. All seven absolutely owned it. I posted Attack On BTS dance practice a few weeks ago and Im so emo looking at how far theyve come as performers and how fierce they are. When the stage began and dance line was breaking it down I thought I wonder what the other boys will do and literally every second of Namjoon, Yoongi and Jins box segments were mesmerizing. All Jin had to do was turn around and pull on a light switch and it was the most godly, charismatic thing ever done on a stage.  

- Hoseok is 100% a triple threat. The way he handles choreography, singing and rapping while going full force is incredible. Those of us fortunate to see them live can attest to Hobis stage presence but you could literally feel his energy coming through the TV on all his parts. I hope he has many hoobaes watching and trying to follow him because damn that boy works hard and is literal sunshine in all that he does.  

  

Ill leave it there for now and look forward to more discussion in the comments.

In NYC, its a mixing pot of beautiful cultures of all races and creeds marked under one umbrella of American. But, despite this, it was difficult for me to identify whose side I wanted to be on growing up. There was a stark difference in how I ate, spoke, dressed and was raised in my Filipino family and with the way other more American children were growing up. 

I attended arts based schools and it was so drastically different to my Asian upbringing. I wanted to fit in and I started ditching things that I enjoyed because I was too Asian it too Pilipino. Even when I got along better with the comic book lovers, anime lovers and Hallyu-philes, I strayed away from them because I was afraid of being judged. 

Even now, I still have that fear. But, Ive started to call myself out on it. And even if its not entirely Bangtans doing, this seven piece talent meal has helped me pinpoint reasons why I do love myself and why I should be proud of my Filipino-ness. How? These guys are Korean, princessdootdoot. KOREAN. How in the Yeontan did they teach you to feel more Filipino? 

Well, let me tell you:

The Asian culture, regardless of what kind, presents individuals with immense pride of their own respective nations. BTS is no exception. 

Growing up in a Filipino household, we were raised with a culture of filial piety and respecting elders. I lost some of that as I grew up and often, I would forget to acknowledge the sacrifice and guidance of my parents. But oddly enough as I entered college, I started watching Asian dramas and subsequently got into Bangtan. 

The Asian Media is so different from western media and I started reabsorbing the little habits of respect to my elders. Even in weekly award shows, idols bow to one another and I was re-exposed to honorifics. My brothers no longer use honorifics but I still call my sister Ate because I know she has much to teach me and that even though age does not equate wisdom, all humans deserve respect, younger or older. Watching and consuming Asian media helped me wet my feet again in what I held important and allowed me to think about what I believed. And in all honesty, I subscribe to the principle of filial piety. I dont look down on others who like the independent state of mind, but it was great to be reminded of that. 

Bangtan, more so than any other group Ive seen are so respectful of those around them that sometimes it becomes comical or absolute grounds for a kdrama. There are countless stories of how sweet and courteous Bangtan it and many award show staff members gush about how well mannered the boys are. [This is a link to a thread of anecdotes about BTS encounters and you can see how they capture hearts so easily with their authenticity and kindness. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/81vmrs/what_are_your_favorite_outsider_anecdotes_about/) They set such an amazing example on how to treat others around me and it has helped me reconnect with my Filipino values and roots. 

Another thing about Bangtan that has rekindled my love for my Filipino culture and heritage is the fact that they are so unabashedly Korean. Wherever they go, they search for Korean meals and everything reminds them of Korea. Theyre so proud when they are recognized by their nation and their heritage and they have so much pride in the fact that they have become a face of Korea. 

Even more so than that, Bangtans music never had the goal of selling musical styles in what Western markets wanted. Of course, Bangtan was originally under the hip hop concept and draws inspiration from Western artists, but it was never their goal to conform to the standard Western sound. Even when it was so very easy to simply sing in English, they remained singing in Korean and allowed the message to connect the people instead of the language. Even in their recent rise to the main stream, it would have been easy to essentially sell out and collaborate with all western artists and cater to the western market. Theres a demand for them after all. 

Yet, BTS remain rooted physically and in all other aspects in Korea. They mix their music there, create their ideas there and always return back to Korea. It is their home base and its where their roots are.  

Furthermore, in their first ever American Award Show comeback, BTS could have chosen any other song to debut with. And here they were, debuting IDOL, a song that so blatantly displays their heritage and culture. Be it in the choreography, the lyrics, the costumes or even the music video. Watching their 2018 MMA performance rocks my world because Bangtan bought to the stage Korean cultural dance and costume. (I wont link it since the official 1theK version isnt out at the time of me writing this yet.)

Of course it is easy to say, Hey, theyre in Korea. Of course they can do that! But that does not take into account the fact that this award shows BECAUSE of Bangtan, has garnered the attention of a worldwide audience. An audience that may have been ignorant to the Korean cultural prior to becoming ARMY. Instead of just presenting a stellar performance with beautiful visuals, they chose to use the MMA stage to take pride in their culture and that inspires me to do the same. 

I have been dancing for our Filipino celebrations each year since I was a child and I used to find myself embarrassed by the notion of any one else finding out. But now, I will whole heartedly exclaim the different  cultural festivals we have and wear my kimonas in a heartbeat. I excite in introducing my cuisine to new friends and speaking openly in my mother tongue. And not only has Bangtans pride in their heritage inspired me to appreciate my culture more and more, it has also helped me open my mind to others cultures as well. 

BTS is making a tidal wave of change in the face of pop culture and I hope they inspire more and more people to love and embrace themselves, regardless of where they are from and where they are headed. ",48,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

So after a year (or more) of procrastination due to my fear of failure, I FINALLY gave it another go at a proper BTS fanart (before it was only two or three small sketches of a couple of other members), and for one of my very first fanart I wanted to capture one of my favorite shots from one of my favorite MVs of all time - which contains one of my favorite looks from Jimin, after BS&amp;T and the Love Yourself: Answer era. He just looks so adorably fluffy and pretty in Spring Day, and I never truly appreciated the color pink, especially pink hair, until I saw him in the MV. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to get some feedback and constructive criticism from real artists here, but I'm still very much an amateur, so please be gentle! I don't draw faces, but I hope that doesn't make it look weird. I kind of messed up on the hair, and I know the backdrop looks super rushed and plain and that the shading isn't the best, but I consider this to be more like a sketch for a bigger and more detailed picture that I'm planning to draw in the future. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the results and that I finally managed to successfully fill in another page of my 2-year old sketchbook that is still mostly empty to this day.",13,1,False,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qlcNWRtUQpXuG2QQmty6X32TJ0Ftc0Fn5sJlvYAnpZs.jpg,,,,,

i make stained glass as a hobby, and since i'm a big fan of bts, i really want to make something bts-inspired.

the problem is that it's hard for me to do details in stained glass, and i don't know how to lead-paint stained glass (which is the technique they use a lot in [church](https://cdn3.volusion.com/numzd.cwtpv/v/vspfiles/photos/SG-496-2.jpg) stained glass, for example), which means that it would be very difficult for me to make a piece with detailed faces or people in general. i feel like it would be hard to do bts justice.

i've tried to come up with some stained glass ideas that are less detailed and would work in an abstract style. i've done pseudo-cubist drawings of faces in the past, which works well in stained glass, so it's possible that i could draw bts or a bts member in that style. that would be difficult for me, though, because i want to do bts justice in terms of their appearance, so i want to hear if anyone on this subreddit has any other ideas! comment your favorite bts mv scenes, performance scenes, or any ideas you have so i can see if it would work.

on another note, if anyone has any fanart they've done of bts and is willing to let me turn it into a stained glass piece, hit me up and i'll see if it would work! (it wouldn't be sold or profited from, i just want something for my own personal enjoyment)",13,1,False,self,,,,,

This is my best and closest friend, weve known each other almost all of our lives. 

She sends me memes and gushes about V and how relatable Yoongi is, and though I know Ive sort of achieved what Ive been trying to do all this time, Im still a bit uneasy. I expected that Id be excited to have another friend to fangirl with, but Im just a little... taken aback?

I know I shouldnt be feeling this way, I know I should be happy and proud that bts has gained yet another fan that they deserve. Happy that I was able to spread the joy that is bts to another. But I cant help feeling a bit odd about it. I just cant put my finger on it either. Is it because shes a new army and Im a bit jealous of that new sort spark that Ill never experience again?

Is it because I somehow feel... threatened as an ARMY?? Is it because I have a subconscious fear that shell end up being more knowledgeable, more educated than I am? 

Is it because I subconsciously believed BTS was something that was my own, something that was only for me and something that set me apart?

Or is it just because Im annoyed by the new army shenanigans??

Im sorry if this brings any negativity to anyone... I just needed to let my thoughts out. I know I shouldnt be feeling this way at all, and its making me feel even more guilty and upset knowing that.

It made me realize that I see lots of articles about Army charitable activities on behalf of BTS, but I don't read much about  BTS themselves doing good works (e.g., major donations, benefit concerts, visits to children's hospitals and the like). I don't see this type of news about other kpop stars, either, except IU and maybe one or two others.  

Does anyone have any knowledge -- or theories -- as to why this is the case?  Is charity considered a private thing in Korea?  Do kpop stars need to exercise caution about which causes they support, for fear of upsetting some faction or other?

As many of us know, Jin's birthday is tomorrow, Dec 4th, he's turning 26. Over the past couple of days ARMYs all over twitter have listened to Jin's [request](https://twitter.com/ukbtsarmation/status/1069351463078567936?s=21), and as a result, a massive amount of armys changed their profile pictures to Jin in those glasses. 

The reason why this is so great is because if you scroll through twitter lots and lots of accounts have that picture as their profile pic ([here are some replies under @bts_twt most recent tweet](https://imgur.com/gallery/gv9QCcI)) and lots of ARMYs are having so much fun talking about Jin, cracking dad jokes, tweeting as if they were jin, sharing fun memes and memories of him and encouraging eachother to stream epiphany.

It's truly a massive and wholesome celebration of Jin's personality and existence!

Jin's 'extraness' has rubbed off on many armys and they're all joyfully interacting with one another, with Jin as the topic of influence.  

Here are several examples of the funny stuff that JINmys have been doing:

[dad jokes](https://twitter.com/toffeelattae/status/1069225750631305216?s=21)

[jin edits and puns](https://twitter.com/xsinguiarity/status/1069381648393875456?s=21)

[where's waldo (jin edition)](https://twitter.com/mslachimolala/status/1069419291534155776?s=21)

And the list goes on!

It's really amazing seeing ARMY collectively celebrate the eldest hyung in a fun and hilarious way (especially because we can't send gifts to them anymore). It's a really unique and creative way of giving them a special and intangible bday gift! We all really hope that the boys are all seeing this (jin's face all over their TL) and are enjoying it as much as we ARMY are!

I just thought i'd share with y'all that aren't on twitter because it's a really great bday project!
Happy birthday JIN!!!

Do you love BTS romantically or?

personally, i love them as idols and as great people. i love them the way you do your platonic boy friends; they're talented, good-looking, caring and great but i'm not attracted to them romantically. but it's not as friends too, it's just like when you don't know that person/not friends but you know they're amazing people, and you love them for like...them.

sometimes i feel weird categorizing love and feelings. why does it have to be romantic, platonic, familial or the like? why cant you just 'love' someone and its just that, love? but i dont wanna be deep today so yeah 

i just think to fall in love with someone, you have to know them personally, and i know bts shares much about their life to us but i feel like there's always going to be a distinction between what they show and who they really are... as people, as NORMAL people, and not as idols, because they always have to uphold that idol-image to us fans, even if they did it unconsciously. but that's my view on it, my opinions - not facts.

It's been a weird thing in my life where when I meet someone and find out they have a similar birthday to me or someone I'm close to, they hold a special place in my heart. It sounds kinda silly when I say it out loud lol.

I'm baby ARMY and in the few months since I've found out about them, I've spent almost every spare moment in my life learning about them and watching them, whether it is MVs, performances, random goofball videos, the Youtube doc series, Burn the Stage, etc. I've think I've seen enough to be able to appreciate each of them individually: RM's leadership and linguistic genius, Suga's passion for music and being super relatable and realistic, Hobi's dance magic and chameleon-ness (He fits in perfectly with the hyungs but also plays like maknae but easily transitions between both and becomes what people need him to be), Jimin's kindness, drive for perfection and extreme duality, Tae's goofball, art appreciating, social butterfly skills and how JK wants to win at everything but still is a cute baby and wants let everyone take care of him while he soaks it all in. 

Then there's Jin. He's a handsome guy who tells dad jokes?! I feel like I am missing something here. I know there's gotta be more to that but from all the content I've seen, I havent truly grasped and understood his character on a deeper level. In honor of our shared birthdays, help me learn more about Jin and what truly makes him special? ",76,1,False,self,,,,,

I know there are rumors about Jin going next year after the new group debuts but I don' think that's likely, he's a 92 liner and right now the idols enlisting into the military are the late late 80s liners: G Dragon (1988), Infinite's Snuggyu (1989), Onew (1989) will enlist very soon, so I think we will have the whole group for at least 3 more years because Jin (1992) and Suga (1993), the oldest members, are just a bit too young to enlist.

I think it will soften the impact if Big Hit sends them in groups instead of one by one and have comebacks in between enlistments with the whole group and have solo work to release while the members are away. Suga/Jin followed by RM/J-Hope/Jimin and then Jungkook/V.

I also think it's good that they're debuting the group next year, because if the boys do start enlisting in 2-4 years, the new group will have had the time to make their space in the music industry.

1.  pt.1
2. Love Yourself: Tear
3. Skool Luv Affair
4. Dark &amp; Wild
5. Love Yourself: Answer\*
6.  pt. 2
7. : Young Forever\*
8. 2 Cool 4 Skool
9. O!RUL8,2?
10. Love Yourself: Her
11. You Never Walk Alone\*
12. Wings

\* I was debating on whether or not I should include these albums, since they're technically special albums / repackages, but I realize they have songs that I listen to a lot that aren't in the standalone albums (i.e. Epiphany, Save Me, Spring Day, etc.)

I'll give you a short blurb of why I ranked my #1 and #12 the way I did:  pt.1 is an album that's near and dear to my heart, as INU came out when I was going through some personal struggles. Plus I thought it was a really nice shift from the usual hip-hop sound that BTS had prior. For Wings, I didn't care too much for the solo tracks. It's not that the songs are bad to me, but I (personally) would've rather had more ot7-based songs like Tear and Dark&amp;Wild did, versus solo tracks.

So, with all of that said, what's your lists? 

Also, I'm sure this goes without saying but let's keep the replies civil, yeah? Please don't get offended by my personal rankings or the rankings of others lol. It's simply just a curious question!",49,1,False,self,,,,,

Ive been on this sub for quite a while now but I usually just comment or like stuff. Although, I wanted to finally ask something. 

So, I still havent recovered from the incredible stage that happened at MMAs a few days ago. BTS have always had incredible performances at good award shows such as MMA and MAMA, and they keep upping their game and surprising us every time. 

So since MAMA is right around the corner, what is something outrageous that you can only dream of happening for a performance (although it may or may not come true). 

For example, my outrageous dream stage for MAMA would be:

-All seven members ripping off shirts (I would not live) 
-Ddeang being performed by rap line 
-More Ariel stunts (like JK in 2016 MAMA) 

So ya, what about you guys?

I am currently in the process of researching a topic to write an extended essay for my ""theories of culture"" class, thinking that it would be interesting to attempt to write something about BTS as a cultural phenomenon. I was hoping some of you guys might be able to help me with it! :)

So far my research hasn't been very fruitful (might be due to the language barrier too, since there's probably a lot published in Korean, which sadly I don't speak), so I am asking you if you perhaps happen to know any academics/scholars who have tried to explain BTS's success? Why were they the first K-pop group to break the western market to such an extent, and why exactly at this point in time? Would you know of any particular cultural theories which could be applied to describe them as a phenomenon? Of course, I'd be really interested in hearing your own opinions, too!! 

&amp;#x200B;

For context: I would like to try and apply Adorno's ""Culture industry"" theory (an idea that originated in the 1940s and is still hugely influential to this day, which basically states that pop culture in the modern age is manufactured almost like any other factory product, hence the name culture *industry*, and that the purpose of pop culture is to render people docile in a capitalist society). My idea is to try and show that while BTS is definitely a manufactured product to a certain extent, their message is nonetheless pretty subversive and I feel like especially their earlier albums were quite effective in empowering students to speak up about the status quo in their society. 

Sorry if this was too specific/uniteresting, I hope I made some sense nonetheless! :) :)",25,1,False,self,,,,,

I've never made a post on here/reddit before so please (re)move this if necessary. I'm hoping to have an open discussion about a more popular/influential meme. I just re-watched the 'If Burn the Stage was Dubbed' series on YT and thought about what the boys would think if they saw it. We know from Jin's birthday today\* that they do peruse through our memes so there's a high chance they've seen these dubs--the first one has almost a million views.

Personally, I find the videos hilarious; but I feel like the culture in Korea on sex is a bit different. How do you guys think the boys would respond to these videos, and to hearing about the sexualization of their interactions in general? Have they addressed this before?

I also want to say that I very much like and appreciate Cameron Philip as an ARMY and a content creator. I enjoyed the videos and I'm from North America so I find this stuff quite funny. I also think it's pretty neat how he was able to come up with a story line and script that fit the boys' actual behaviors and dialogue. It was the overtly sexual aspect of it that triggered my curiosity.

Personally, i dont think so. Bighit will debut the new bg early next year so i dont think bighit will tr to overlap bts' cb with them. Plus bts is still touring. 


I think they would comeback around may/june/july. I really think it's time for a visual album. I really want them to try either 7 deadly sins or Dante's Divine Comedy.

I ordered the tickets a month in advance (October) to get the best seats available. For two tickets, plus fees... it ended up being about $34. A small price to pay to show support for our boys. This was coming off the high of seeing them LIVE at Citi Field in NY. 

So fast forward to the day of the movie. My husband and I were eating lunch when he casually asked what time the show started. I confidently said 7:00 pm! The reason I was so confident about the time was because the closest Regal Cinema was only offering ONE MEASLY showing of Burn the Stage for each day-- Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

I had originally wanted to see the show on Friday night at 7:00 pm, but because I waited ONE WHOLE DAY after the pre-release of the movie tickets, all the good seats were taken. Okay, Thursday, 7:00 pm, nope. Saturday, 7:00 pm... not even a chance. Sunday? Score! What better way to spend a Sunday than with Bangtan? 

So with a mouth full of fries, I began pulling up our ticket info on the movie site. Two tickets, yep. Sunday, check. Noon... yeah...wait, what? No...no... the time was supposed to be 7:00 pm like EVERY OTHER showing at this theater. By now it was already almost 2:00 pm. We had missed the LAST showing for this run. As far as we knew, Burn the Stage wasn't coming back to our theater. To add insult to injury, the theater wasn't obligated to refund our tickets. That was fair, we were the ones who carelessly missed the show.

Long story short. I just purchased tickets tonight for the second run of Burn the Stage; playing tomorrow (Thursday) at... you guessed it... 7:00 pm.  Wish us luck on making it to the theater this time!",1,1,False,self,,,,,

* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""** and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

I luckily live super close to the NA store and I'm planning on stopping by to pick up a few things for myself. [See link for goods, specifically just the IN STORE exclusives.](http://app.ithk.com/chocoolate/bt21/?ts=cclxbt21&amp;utm_campaign=cclxbt21_en&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=cc_ig) So I figured since I was going through all the trouble, if anyone else is super interested in getting something, I can do so and ship it out to you.  US/CANADA only, please.

&amp;#x200B;

Caveat tho, I'm not a GO manager and won't be taking huge orders (maybe from 3-5 people only) cause I won't ask for payment until the goods are in my hands.  Prices should be around $100-120 USD for the hoodies shipped, and probably $50 USD for the shirts/cap.  There isn't an official price list yet so I'm basing this out of the prices from previous collab sales.  If it ends up cheaper I will adjust to that too. (paypal and interac e-transfer for methods of payment).  If you have any questions I'll try to answer them but yeah, just trying to help a few folks out.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is interest for UK/EU, I do believe there's a twitter account that's hosting a GO for the merchandise.",7,1,False,self,,,,,

Smut is so not it. Am I the only one who finds it morally reprehensible? I mean not because its sexual, Im all for sexual liberation, but because its sexually explicit content.. sometimes toxic, unhealthy or disturbing in nature.. written about a real person... WITHOUT their consent.. isnt that kind of.. not okay?

Dont stans always go on and on about respecting and loving their idols, and then they go and cross this very personal line for their own sexual amusement? Um?? Thank u, next

I dont know about you guys! But I am of the opinion that if people can (rightfully) get sued for writing defamatory comments about BTS then they should also be prohibited from writing sexually explicit content about them. I think smut about fictional characters is fine.. but when its real people with feelings, insecurities, actual sex lives, personal lives and dignity, its not okay fam.

SPOILER ALERT!!! Don't read this if you havent seen the first 4 episodes of BV season 1!!!!!

I'm new around here and the fandom in general and am discovering the magic of the Bon Voyage series. I just watched the first 4 episodes of the first season and captured some thoughts. Might be a good refresher for a lot of you who've watched it ages ago? Hope you enjoy my random thoughts and fangirl moments.

EP. 1

1. Northern Europe! YAAASS, let's get it.

2. Their apartment was so humble back then but they're living like true kings now! Started from the bottom now the whole team here.

3. Is this self-check in scene a sign of things to come?

4. Yep. Theyve just arrived in Bergen and Jimin lost his luggage already. I love how dad Suga is being. He's so done already.

5. Oh no! They lost baby JK. Oh phew, he was just taking pics. HE IS SO CUTE.

6. Suga the accountant steps up to take care of the money. I'm impressed by how he counts cash. Its like he's done it before or something.

7. An entire scene dedicated to Kookie trying to figure out the washing machine, I'm into it.

8. Birthday surprise for JK's coming of age!!! SO CUTE. They love him so much!! 

Ep. 2

1. Woo! Tae's on his way to join them. His convo with his grandparents is so lovely, I'm crying.

2. Jin is SO friendly, even amongst strangers in a foreign country.. just wow. Confident Jin is who I aspire to be.

3. Love how fearless Jin and Hobi are with speaking English. Hobi's random comments, sound effects and positivity amaze me. I think I'd want to travel with him. 

4. Namjoon and Jimin hiking. What a crazy contradiction.. ""I'm tired"". ""Ok, no problem, let's do tough choreography too then.""

5. V really doesn't play by anyone's rules. Pulls out his credit card to buy food but gets so scared when he might be in trouble.

6. Where is Suga?!

7. I love it when they all reunite!! You can tell they miss each other so much when even one member is missing. JK and Tae are attached at the hip now. 

Ep 3.

1. Suga's a jack of all trades: producer, rapper, dancer, cat and master budgeter.

2. I love how happy they are when they're about to eat.. not even fancy food either.

3. V is such a trickster listening to Jin, JK and Suga's mics from far away lolz Proceeds to spend his cash on a bike rental lol he truly just does him.

4. Jimin trying to charm his way into getting money to buy souvenirs. Of course he succeeds.

5. OMG the scene where V loses his passport and the members fight is so stressful and tense. I hated it!! But I loved how he knew them so well and knew right away they were all lying and played them right back. V is savageee.

6. Taking pics by the waterfall, these boys are so photogenic and beautiful!! 

7. Suga's travel dad look is very nice. Me likey.

8. Jimin finding a lost ticket. This has become the hidden camera show.

9. An entire storyline about Jimin making rice? Why not? I love their food scenes. Any scene where they're buying groceries, cooking together or eating together, yes please.

Ep 4.

1. Another lost item.. seriously!? This is too much. These boys..

2. Stockholm yesss!!

3. Oh dear, they got split up to get to the hotel.. hope they all survive.. and Jimin forgets his bag a third time.

4. RM and Suga are soo confident.. I can tell somethings gonna go wrong for them.

5. Jin eats the monstrous Tiger burger. They're eating with a fork and knife! Thats a nice way to keep your hands clean lol

6. KIM TAEHYUNG WHAT ARE YOU DOING.. NOT THAT BUS klsdkfklsdsm

7. Omg when I went on my Eurotrip honeymoon and stopped in Stockholm, my husband and I also went to Ikea for meatballs like JK and Hobi &lt;3 Their happiness eating Ikea meatballs shows so much humility.. I love these humble kings.

8. Aww, Jimin looking at baby shoes is too much.

9. I can't believe V ended up in the middle of nowhere.. I suppose he was never in any real danger but thats just too crazy that he decided to hop on any random bus. 

10. Oh good he finally gets picked up and gives up his allowance for the rest of the boys without hesitating.. (he plans on using his credit card anyway)

&amp;#x200B;

After 4 episodes, I loved it. I can't wait to see more. They are such a happy bunch. They appreciate everything so much and genuinely love spending time together. I am shocked how well everyone gets along!! Its so interesting watching them be ""normal"" and seeing that they have lots of growing up to do. I wonder what else happens.. and how things change through the other seasons.. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

With the music and choreography of his choosing, he wouldn't necessarily need more than plain white room or a darkened stage with a spotlight. Do as many pieces as there are songs on a mixed tape.  Package it as one performance (with separate acts) or as a series of videos. 

&amp;#x200B;

Put it on the paid versions VLive or Youtube or iTunes or ...  ? ...  and I would definitely pay to have it.

I truly hope you're all well. I'm in a situation where I need to get rid of a large portion of the goods I have purchased here. Never fun, but it is what it is I suppose. The prices listed are not inclusive of shipping and PayPal fees. I'd pay at least PayPal fees if I wasn't in such a crappy situation. PayPal fees can be avoided if you don't go through Goods and Services which is never really recommended with online vendors, but it's up to you. I apologize for not being able to cover that ;;. I'm currently in Korea and will be stuck here for another month and a half (why I need the funding), so please be aware that shipping prices will reflect that. I can combine shipping for multiple goods. Generally there are two options for shipping; the boat method known as ""surface"" which is cheaper, and Airmail which takes around a week or so. I know I'm eating my words because I said I wasn't going to do this again; I'm incredibly sorry. You guys are too patient and kind.

**So, what gift ideas do you have for the new BTS fan or hardcore ARMY?**

Being that theres been an uptick in non-ARMY crawling this sub for ideas, feel free to write as if youre talking to someone who doesnt know where to get this item. Ill start with some of the obvious. (Mine are all U.S. centric, if youre a non-U.S. fan feel free to comment on where to get merchandise in your country).

&amp;#x200B;

**EASY TO FIND GIFTS:**

* BTS Love Yourself Albums (Target) For U.S. fans, its so easy now to pick up BTS Love Yourself albums Her, Tear, and Answer at Target for about $25 each. If the recipient already has one copy of each, check the spine and get them another version. There are 4 different versions for each album, which means a different photobook, a random photocard, and possibly (depending on the printing) a different poster. Her spells L, O, V, E.  Tear spells Y, O, U, R. Answer spells S, E, L, F. 
* BTS Love Yourself Albums (Amazon) - You can also find the albums on Amazon if you don't live near Target, however the versions are randomly sold. If buying from Amazon, try to find the album shipped &amp; sold by Amazon. This is for a few reasons: (a) Prime shipping if you're a prime member, (b) if you buy HER Amazon will give you a free digital auto-rip so you can check BTS out yourself,  (c) the ability to tell your recipient that the copy you bought them counts towards the U.S. Billboard charts, (d) you know it's a legit copy so it comes with the random photocard.
* BT21 merchandise  each member of BTS helped create a cute character (similar to Hello Kitty, Gudetama, Aggretsuko, etc). You can buy BT21 merchandise like hairbands, tshirts, and plushies at Hot Topic's online website. If you live in Los Angeles, New York City, or Toronto, you can also go to the BT21 pop-up store. The Hot Topic merchandise starts at $16.
* Other BTS CDs / DVDs / Blu-Rays: Walmart online and Deepdiscount.com (a subsidiary of Walmart) both sell a limited selection of other BTS singles/CDs/DVDs/Blu-Rays. If shopping at Walmarts online website, make sure to filter by Retailer and select Walmart.com to make sure youre getting Walmart as the official seller, as some of the third party sellers may not sell legitimate goods. I think the cheapest CD starts at $20.
* *First Time with BTS?* Is the only official BTS authorized book, translated from Korean to English. Its sold on Amazon by the publisher, KALBPA, for $25 + shipping. Its also sold on KALPAs online store ([www.kalbpa.com](http://www.kalbpa.com)), as of this writing they are selling it with a limited promotion that gives free shipping in the U.S.
*  A Spotify premium subscription: If your recipient doesnt have a Spotify membership, this is a great gift. BTS is one of the most streamed groups on Spotify for two main reasons: (a) they have great music, and (b) a lot of the BTS fandom participates in charting, which is streaming or buying digital copies constantly to boost BTSs numbers in the U.S. The BTS Twitter fandom is also often following BTSs numbers on # of streams and has occasional streaming parties. Giving them a Spotify premium membership lets them participate in charting and streaming parties without advertisements. You can buy gift cards for Spotify or gift Spotify Premium digitally. Lifewire has a guide on how to gift Spotify membership written up here: [https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-buy-spotify-premium-as-a-gift-2438310](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-buy-spotify-premium-as-a-gift-2438310). 
*  Itunes gift card for the Apple user: Similar to the Spotify membership  an itunes gift card will let the recipient buy copies of albums that are hard to find in store, or participate in charting. Whenever BTS releases a new digital single, it often hits #1 on itunes for a reason. 

  

**Brick &amp; Mortar Your Mileage May Vary For Rare and Highly Wanted Items:**

* Time magazine poster &amp; random magazines - BTS was on the cover of the international version of Time Magazine this year, and Barnes and Noble sold reproduction posters of the cover. The website says its Temporarily Out of Stock, but you can try going into your local BN. If nothing else, they may also be selling copies of BTSs latest Japanese single, Fake Love, or copies of random music/teen magazines featuring BTS. The poster was $13. 
* Puma shoes  BTS is a global ambassador of Puma, and Puma sells BTS Turin ($70) and BTS Basket ($90) shoes. I think theyre mostly sold out online now, but if you live near a Puma store, you can see if they have any in stock.
* BTS Wings Tour T-shirt: Hot Topics online website only has the Wings Tour shirt left in 3X, but if you live near a brick and mortar, you can try searching through the wall of concert tees and see if they have another size in-stock. 



**DIY creative ideas - If you are crafty, you can totally make something!**

* Buy a BTS fanmade patch on etsy and iron-on or glue it onto a  plain t-shirt, beanie, gloves, etc.
* Buy iron-on paper &amp; a plain t-shirt or hoodie. Then print the BTS design of your choice, and iron it onto a t-shirt or hoodie.
* Self-coupon book  if youre already making your recipient a self-coupon book (e.g. coupon for one home cooked meal, one massage, etc.), add in a coupon for a future BTS-related activity! Examples: a coupon for helping buy X number of copies of the next BTS single release to help with charting, a coupon for watching X number of hours of BTS music videos together, a coupon that commits you to listening to a BTS album on a roadtrip, etc.
* Etched glass  pick up glassware at your local dollar store (where I live Dollar Tree has a great selection of glass made in the U.S.) and etching cream at your local craft store. You can then find BTS-related designs and go to town. Some easier ones might be the BTS or ARMY logos of the door opening/closing, though a BT21 or outline of someone in an iconic dance move would be cool.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that kpop fandoms will use any excuse to get angry at each other, but it's legitimately baffling to me to see so many people misuse the term. And it seems to me like it's getting worse with each passing year.

I know this is an issue that pertains to Bts especially but its something I see everywhere in kpop fandom, to the point that its become somewhat of a hallmark of the fandom culture. I'm going to omit using specific examples because I don't want to turn this into a drama thing, but I think most Armys are aware of the way Bts have been dealing with false plagiarism claims basically throughout their entire career. And the thing that gets me is that its usually over something that doesn't count as plagiarism at all. Hair color, general themes, incredibly common stuff like mirrors or school uniforms; this is stuff I usually see brought up in these conversations. Its alarming to me that so many people see this stuff and legitimately believe that its plagiarism. Its easy to blame this on the general age and aggressive nature of kpop fandom, but I've been in other fandoms with the same average age range and heated rivalries with other fandoms, and I've never seen anything like this.

And yet, when ACTUAL potential plagiarism is brought up (not gonna use any examples here for the same reason as above) people will fight tooth and nail about it not being true. Art or music being lifted, almost wholesale in some cases, from other artists is generally not treated very seriously. The term has become so completely bastardized that I don't think the people who use it even understand what its supposed to mean anymore. Why do you think this is this a thing that's so prevalent in kpop fandom?",20,1,False,self,,,,,

This isn't a post that's insulting my boys, but more so insulting the music venue I went to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just saw them FOR THE FIRST TIME this past Saturday in Taiwan. My tickets were, obviously, not cheap. I even selected tickets that were medium priced because I wanted to have a good view. The section was towards the back, however, the stage was made extending towards that section area, so I knew they would walk up towards it and I'd have a close enough look at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I thought I'd also be able to watch the whole freaking show. We get into the stadium (floor/standing section) and what do you know, our section is right behind the cameras and a GIANT TARP that's covering most of the view. How the hell is this not mentioned on any website? How the hell was this section more expensive? I'd be lying if I said I didn't actually cry at one point. (I took a flight in just for this concert). 

I was infuriated, I wanted to have my mind blown at this show but here I was standing with a pretty shitty view. So instead of feeling like I was at the concert, I felt like I was watching it from the outside looking in. I purchased the ticket from viagogo (which I've come to learn shortly after is actually a shit site for tickets). 

I know it might not do much, but I really want to leave a review on the show/concert set up. Is there a way to go about this? I think people should know ahead of time what they're paying for.

I want to take some time this month to create some artworkstickers, wallpapers, pins, postcardsjust about anything. I have a lot of ideas in mind but would love to get more opinions. Would be super if you could tell me what you think is something that's iconic and memorable to BTS. e.g. symbols like wings &amp; smeraldo flower, lyrics like ""mic mic bungee"" or ""Eolssu Johda"", MV scenes like arm lock scene in DNA or mountain of clothes in Spring Day.

#I. New Theme

As those of you on desktop must've noticed, we just changed the subreddit's theme to match the new album coming out. I apologise for the delay.

For those of you on mobile, this is what the new theme looks like:

* [Day mode](https://i.imgur.com/HKDAcaU.jpg);
* [Night mode](https://i.imgur.com/Bkx3vX4.jpg).

To switch to night mode, you will need to be on the classic/old reddit and have [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) installed. [Here is how you can turn it on](https://i.imgur.com/ZjW6psb.gif).

Reminder that you can check out all past themes in our [layout archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/layouts) in the wiki.

* As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.
* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.
* Choose wisely! **Your vote is final** and cannot be changed.
* I will post a new poll every **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Sunday**. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted. I try to post around **8 AM - 10 AM PST**. Sometimes it may take longer if I need to download and analyze the data when the vote is close or seems odd, or if my personal life intrudes.
* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by \*\*searching this sub for ""survivor""\*\*and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

# Final Round

**PLEASE VOTE** [**HERE**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW7AsY305H4x4rfnVEmIYODQYK1iBk823QXSBgv6onngQIDA/viewform)

Anyone know if there are subbed versions of these interviews or even a transcript? I added a few links to the videos.

 I think, maybe, I'm loving BTS music, especially, because I have to find  translations and, actually, read the lyrics.   


 Usually, I listen to music with one ear, and only really listen if I hear  something that truly grabs my attention. And usually, it's the music itself that  first catches me, not the lyrics. If I'm honest, I hear the overall theme or  subject and the repeated phrases and that's about it. An English language artist  has to have something obviously profound to say or I don't put much effort into  really hearing their words.  
   
 But, this lazy listening doesn't work if a BTS song catches your attention.  I was happy to just listen and watch on YouTube because the music sounded good  to my ear (and the choreography just killed). But then I learned something about  Baepse and started to read the lyrics which led me to really think about what  was being said ... and love the song on even more levels.  
   
 So, what do you think? Do you love the music more because you have to pay more attention and, actually, kinda study it?

Sorry for double posting but I'm doing so for 2 reason; I'd prefer to do a discount bundle due to my situation and I've acquired two new items as a parting gift from a fellow study abroad ARMY and she kindly allowed me to sell them after I told her what's going on. In turn I gave her my ARMY Bomb since I wouldn't have the guts to sell it anyway and she's probably the thing I'll most treasure the most from this trip. I only bring this up because I was questioned on my last post and I would prefer that not to happen again. :)    
  
In regards to the stuff. I was able to return the Tata pillow/diary and most of the squishy dolls thank god so I only have Chimbles. I'll lay everything out in terms of price, if you find cheaper anywhere let me know. I'm trying to discount as much as I can but still make enough to stay afloat. I'd prefer to sell everything in one go, hence the price. Everything in this post shipped surface should only be $35. Surface is tracked by the way. If you'd prefer air, please understand the price will be over double. We can definitely do that if you'd prefer though.

The total for everything is ~~$365~~ excluding the $35 shipping fee. This is totally random, but if you like Pokemon and live in the states I have an extra thing I can send to you as a gift. I won an 24cm Alolan Vulpix Plushie with a free play from Toreba, so if you're in the states I can have them ship it to your mailing address (someone will need to sign for it though). If you don't like Pokemon but find the creature cute in general, you're more than welcome to claim it. All of Toreba's stuff is authentic/high quality so you might even be able to sell it or regift it to a fan.  
  
So yep, that should be it. Let me know if you have any questions please. I was fortunate enough to find a cheaper accommodation than my current closet, but I'll need to book for that before my stay is up here. Should be interesting to see how small the new space is if I survive the next couple of days. My current accommodation has about 4 feet of walking space in both directions and is in a pretty shabby part of Seoul. The new place is about 1/4 the price cheaper. There aren't many photos to get a good look either. rip me.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Her current one has like 4k-5k and she gains mad clout and recognition for it.


She used to be my mutual on Twitter so at some point I saw her thread and checked it out. Lo behold, she stole my theory interpretation and didnt credit me. [Evidence](https://imgur.com/a/on5LEGA)

Wanna know how I found out? 1:1 The same sentence, She also overtook my quoting and spelling mistake  And when I called her out, she said ""thats how I write"".  (Referring to my spelling mistake of 'persception')


She also stole from this really popular theorist on Amino and in the comment section of said Blog entry someone also said she stole from them.  [Amino blog](https://aminoapps.com/c/btsarmy/page/blog/dear-disrespectful-twitter-thief/D8BQ_p81hPuxNmmRexGmkogkw2jvpWrrKr4)

ALL of us got blocked, my mutuals that called her out got blocked as well.


Her current @ is outroyoonns.


She got my account suspended. I tried to talk it out privately but she kept blocking me, so I wrote her through like 2-3 side accounts until I has enough and made an expose thread a week later after I got my main acc back (was restricted for other reasons).


I grew up in an abusive household and know gaslighting + manipulation + guilttripping etc. and she was doing this to others and me and I have 0 tolerance nor kindness towards that bullshit.
So, I insulted and clowned her on Twitter after she accused Ilsanqueen of stealing her theories, because she did literally the same and she blocked anyone who mentioned it.

Which lead her to unblock my main account and personally attacking me.


Its my own fault for insulting her but she kept stealing shit from others and me, she also kept making fun of my mental state and my concert experience (I fainted there) and got extremly personal. So I didnt feel bad at all when I insulted her back and clowned her. Because I TRIED to be nice and kind to her in the DMs.


Anyway, sad for me that she used this opportunity to report all my tweets and now my Twitter with all of my content is gone. Its ok though because Im giving up on that site completly.

So... if you see this girl on your TL, do all creators who were affected by her the favour and report + block this girl. She also accused me of stealing her content but I pointed out the dates that my content came out earlier.


My content has been stolen over 5x in the matter of 2 months on Twitter and I really hate that I do the work and others get the recognition, so Ill always call out that BS. Im overprotective af over my creative work, be it drawings, music covers, edits or theories.


Just because its Twitter doesnt make it ok, we put in effort into what we do. I told her if she did this in university (plagiarism), she wouldve been kicked out.



Thanks for reading my rant, I guess.


Just wanted to warn some of you. 


This will also be the last ever entry Ill make about this, its been a week and this week has been shit af for me just because of her doing this bullshit. I just want justice.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Do you also feel that the real you and your soul is different than who you are living in this society? Ive always think that its separate. 

I feel that I can grasp the real me at night when everything is quiet. Just like Joon said you get drunk in your emotions. I feel like a different person when Im alone at night or even just at night and can get back to the me that society knows during the day. Is it what you call moonchild? 

Like I was born loved by my family, I have so many friends and I can say Im not that suffering too much financially, but my inner self is sad and lonely. I feel like I shouldnt be, with the reason that I have a good environment. So I always want to show the positive me to others, but at night I always feel emotional and extra sad.

# Next Survivor Series

The next survivor game will be **Mixtape Series: Mono.**

* The first round will be posted on **Sunday, December 16th** between **8 - 10 AM PST**.

After the mixtape series completes, I'm currently planning on doing the **Ultimate / Era Championships**.

* The first round of survivor games will be by era. We will take the top 3 songs from each album survivor series of that era, except for the following exceptions:
   * HYYH: Young Forever and YNWA only had 3 songs, so we will take the top 1
   * LY: Her had cheating and LY: Answer had a song lose by 1 vote, so we will take the top 4
* The top 3 songs from each era championship series will be entered into an ultimate championship series.
* I have currently split it as follows:

I live in an European country (not UK) and Id really like to order BTS merch online, like a hoodie or a shirt or something. Are there any reliable online shops that other ARMYs have experience with? Hopefully ones that dont have shockingly high shipping prices (though of course I dont expect free shipping), shockingly high import costs, or straight up scamming stores.

My sister and I have been a fan of Kpop since 2009. We stanned another group at the time and were active in the fandom until about 2011. When she started working, she had less and less time for it so shed just be updated on MV releases, major news, but thats about it. 

I was still actively looking at and consuming KPop in this time. I didnt stan any group, until I saw their Mic Drop performance on MCountdown. After that, it was all down the rabbit hole.

Anyway, I got super into BTS but my sister wasnt enthusiastic. I got the feeling that she felt like I was cheating on our OG group. I gradually stopped showing her BTS videos because everytime I did, she was kind of aloof about them. I had other ARMY friends and this sub anyway so I had an outlet for all my spazzing. Deep down though, I wished I could share my happiness with her. 

Fast forward to recently, she got into a Korean actor. Like majorly obsessed, like I am woth BTS. This rubbed me the wrong way because wasnt she cheating now?? Haha but anyway, I spoke to her about it and told her about my feelings. She admitted to having a negative impression of BTS because she fet like BTS was one of the groups that led to a mass exodus of fans from or OG group. A big discussion ensued, lots of tears were shed, and she was very apologetic about not being more enthusiastic because to her, I was more important than her dislike for BTS. We agreed to show each other videos of our respective favorite korean boys and made up. All good. 

I honestly didnt know where to start because they have SO MUCH CONTENT. I felt like I wanted to show her a different side of BTS so last night, I showed her that AHL episode when they had the dance battle with the pro dancers. I enjoyed that episode, and the fact that they were underdogs tbere made me root for them the first time I saw it. After the episode, she was just quiet with no reactions and I was just trying to be nonchalant, I thanked her for watching it then we went to bed right after. 

I feel like her non reaction shows that she dislikes them way more than I initially thought. Now, whatever video I show next is going to be crucial. I need help! Should I show Burn The Stage episodes? Behind the Scenes MV filming?  I also need to prepare myself for the worst, which is that shell continue to dislike them EVEN AFTER showing her all these things. 

Any tips? Suggestions? Words of wisdom? I usually am able to deal with issues objectively and simply, but idk why but man when it comes to BTS, Im just so emotionally invested that rationality comes second. 

TL;DR: My sister dislikes BTS but has agreed to give them a chance. I showed her a video and she was just silent afterwards. What next? ",41,1,False,self,,,,,

Hopefully this is allowed here! 

When all is said and done, I think all ARMYs would agree that the fame and fortune isn't worth it if the stress is too much to handle and our boys aren't happy.. they've been at it since 2010/2011 and i don't think we muggles could even imagine living the idol lifestyle for 7-8 whole years. It's a lot, and we've heard directly from them many instances in which their fame has created significant fear of not being able to outdo their past success and falling from such a high place.

I'm honestly happy that they were able to have the discussion about whether or not they could keep going, with their packed schedules and the high pressure. We know that each of them would be successful no matter what they do after bangtan and would continue to love them all the same. With that said, I'm so glad that ARMYs are such a loving community that has supported the boys and given them the strength to continue being together... we're not something they have ever taken for granted. 

Overall I wasn't surprised by this news and am sincerely hoping that bighit takes responsibility for their mental and physical health these next seven years. Of course, ARMY will be by their side every step of the way to make their hard work worth it. Much love &lt;3",280,1,False,self,,,,,

Honestly, I felt like my heart left my body and flew to Hongkongtheir performance was more than great, their stage presence was burning, and their charisma, man. I thought I died. 

But what stuck with me the most was when they received the Artist of the Year award. Just to be clear, I was not surprisedI know deep down they deserve it. But after all the awards and recognitions they received locally and internationally, these boys remained humble. 

I know they've been through a lot of difficult times, but I'm still sad to know that I cannot know all their troubles, and may never be able to help alleviate them. 
That the time when they were thinking about disbanding because it was hard, all I thought about was when I would see them again or whether they'd guest on a show because I missed them. 

I realized maybe I have been greedy. 
I don't have an access to fancafe nor can I understand Korean, but in case BTS sees this, I want them to know that whatever decision they have made in the past, whatever decision they will make today, and whatever decision that they will make in the future

I will support them, as long as they are happy. 
I am happy for them and will always be proud of who they are. I hope that from today onwards, there will never be days when they are sad or days when they would feel like they are not enough. 

Because on days when I felt like I will never be enough for anyone, BTS has consoled me and showed me that I have reasons I should love myself. 

I love them.

I became interested in BTS in late 2016 but I only graduated from my some relationship with the fandom and joined in 2017 hence I only have last year to compare this year to. In hindsight, last year was relatively calm. It was a time of so much excitement as the fandom kept on breaking down barriers and each month came with a new shock of a new achievement we previously didnt think we were capable of happening. I can just say it was just a beautiful time of  upward trajectory and uncharted territory. The only scandals I can think of were 
a) the no signal controversy- this was quite petty in hindsight 
b) the Xsport news scandal - this could have ended up really badly, but instead it set a precedent for the fandom coming together to protect our band. I actually think its the first time BTS/big hit/army and the media saw that we werent to be messed with pettily anymore and I think the media might have learnt a thing or two in putting some respect on BTSs name.

Come 2018 which in comparison was just 10 times more intense. As a fandom, weve had extremely high highs for example, BTS outcast, the idol dance challenge, Tear making number 1, the tours, the cultural merit award just to name a few. However, with each extreme high, weve had extremely lows. For example, after the number 1s we had the military scandal which made us realise the limits of our power as a fandom as we were helplessly thrust in a scandal we didnt ask for. We also had the bird controversy which was the biggest civil war weve ever had and it threatened to tear down the very fabrics of our fandom which had made us so strong in the first place. To top it all off we had the t shirt scandal which was just really hard on everybody but then it brought us together again with us buying 2,3 and also getting closer to the Japanese side of the fandom. Finally, we had the disbandment bombshell which I wont dwell too much on as its still a little soon. 

Now my question to you is, are you okay? (Namjoons voice). But seriously, how was it for you being in the fandom this year? What were your highs and lows? How do you think we did compared to last year? In what ways did we grow/regress? How do you think we will fare in 2019? What skills that weve learnt now do you think will help us then? 

Im sorry this ended up being longer than intended, but take your time, lets have an army conversation and in case this hasnt been clear, I purple you all",19,1,False,self,,,,,

All understandable and utterly valid, but I had a different reaction personally - happiness and pride that they worked through it, and are able to often be the thoughtful, defiant, unironic kings of their last Festa and IDOL after the ache and bruising of Fake Love. All bands go through hard times repeatedly, but we stan emotionally brilliant men who attacked it - and will continue to attack it - head on. That's pretty astounding at their ages and with the level of pressure they have to deal with. They clearly get great pleasure in their jobs despite the hardships, and love each other deeply. 

So for anyone also happy at their progress, or who just needs a good BTS pick-me-up and reminder of how joyous they are, come share some happy, silly, fun, or even just astounding/performance-and-musical-emperor moments with me!

About the postcards: you get all of them, but I didn't want to break the seal which is why I used an external photo to show you what they look like.  

LE = Limited Edition  

The only reason the clipboard has no photocards is because she was a dodo and didn't realize they were missing upon purchase. (  )

# GAME RULES

* As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.
* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.
* Choose wisely! **Your vote is final** and cannot be changed.
* I will post a new poll every **Tuesday**, **Thursday**, and **Sunday**. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted. I try to post around **8 AM - 10 AM PST**. Sometimes it may take longer if I need to download and analyze the data when the vote is close or seems odd, or if my personal life intrudes.
* You can find the current and previous survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""** and sorting by newest.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

# Round 1

**PLEASE VOTE** [**HERE**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJxGZnae-rMUMCOa73oJQiEMwwoX2TKGCRsMW3EdDQYUaAfA/viewform)

**You can view the current response summary by clicking on the ""**[**See previous responses**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJxGZnae-rMUMCOa73oJQiEMwwoX2TKGCRsMW3EdDQYUaAfA/viewanalytics)**"" link after you vote.** You can see what song each pie slice stands for by (for PC) hovering above each pie slice or (for mobile) tapping on the song in the legend list and looking at what slice is outlined.

10 years from now
You're walking home from your late night shift at work with a frown on your face; today you missed the train you always use to get home/to work, not to mention you also missed the late night emergency bus you use as your back up plan to get home. It's around 10-9 pm and stress is building up due to the workload you've been given. The night breeze hits your face as you listen to your music. A few minutes pass and you walk past a park, a park where you used to jam out to kpop songs with your friends. Then, just like it was meant to be, Pied Piper starts playing. As all ARMYS know, pied piper is a song about them. Your brain is flooded with memories of being an ARMY. You stop walking and turn back around to sit on a swing. You stay there for a while, wondering what the boys are up to now. You shed a few tears before the song ends. Whilst leaving the park, a smile creeps up onto your lips.""

Good thing we actually know they've signed for seven more years or every day we'd be worried they'd break up. It's bad enough we worry if Jin will get bashed/disliked for his openness, if ARMY will start feeling disconnected from their idols (they've seen they don't really know all there is to know about them, what they show has been proved to be quite different from what was really going on), if Tannie's effectively managed to console his master etc.

And this brings me to shipping. I was never into real person shipping, don't get it AT ALL, for numerous reasons. However, apparently it's huge in this fandom, as evident in all the fan art, the crazy fanfics (mostly written by underage girls??), even the ship wars now wtf. I don't get why it's so popular (pls explain?), but apparently it could be one of the reasons ARMY has become a fandom so big, and so obsessed.

Now what I really don't get is how shipping can be so popular in a country that is very conservative, esp. when it comes to this kind of relationships. Which also means that this may not just be a harmless oxymoron. Following the truly painful to watch MAMA revelation, I began to wonder about the things that ARMY do and could be making BTS's lives even more difficult. And considering how much they want their families to appreciate and be proud of them, idk, I can't not think that all this shipping and the 'fanservice' they feel they have to oblige to, isn't killing them inside, knowing that their friends, and, more importantly families know about it. Even if their families are open minded about LGBT rights, all these speculations (or rather downright detailed fantasies) about what could be going on between the group members, could it be doing them more harm than good? Any thoughts?

**Getting Ready:**

With the Permission of the Mods I've decided to go ahead and do something that I've been thinking about for a few months now I've called the Love Yourself Project. I wanted to create a space for those of us here on Reddit to be deliberate and conscious about loving ourselves, but also learn how to set goals, stick to them, and come out the other side of this process loving yourself a little bit or a lot more.  


So...I'd like to introduce you to the Love Yourself Project.  


**Here's what it is:**  


The Love Yourself Project is a four week challenge/encouragement series that will take place the month of January. Each week I'll be posting a different thing to think about and action steps to take. We'll start by setting our goals week one and we'll practice forming habits or taking action steps towards things that help us love ourselves. This is the only time this project will get it's own post. The Mods have asked me to post these in the weekly room post after this one and I will use this post as a master and edit with links to those posts. 

**How is this any different than new years resolutions?**

The love yourself goal could be a new years resolution...but the real focus here is going to be figuring out where you need to love yourself more. It's easy to say ""I'm going to lose ##lbs/kgs."" as a new year's resolution...but we need to figure out they *why* behind that. How is losing that weight going to help you love yourself? Will it make you feel better and healthier? Do you need to love yourself that way? Or are you doing it so that you'll finally be the size the magazines or internet told you you needed to be?

You could also say something like ""I'm going to be more social"" "" Again, we want to talk about the why...and we want to keep asking ourselves ""How does this help me love myself more?""  


Instead of starting with the goal...I want to encourage you all to start with ""How can I love myself more?"" and then work backwards to make that into your goal. I want to encourage you to think deeply about those pockets of yourself that you don't love and work towards generosity, love, and grace towards yourself. And, if change needs to happen, I want to give you the tools to change. For some of you, loving yourself is going to involve actual changes to your lifestyle. For others, we'll need to rework our cognitive processes. Either way, you are worth loving. And you are worth the time and energy investment this will take.  


**So...what do I need to do?**

In order to participate in this...all you have to do is follow along. You can do it here on Reddit, or you can do it offline in a journal.

Each week of January, starting Monday, December 31st (EST), I'll put up a post with an action plan for you to work through that week to help you refine and stick with your goal. Of course, how far you go is up to you and I cannot make you work hard on something. You need to be the one to put in the work/effort to love yourself more...and you will be the one who is rewarded, too. I'm going to give you the tools - you will need to be the one to pick the tools up and use them.

If you want to go further, you can sign up to get an accountability partner (or trio) here. You can sign up on Week 1 after you've set your Love Yourself goal and I'll be matching you as closely as possible based on similar goals so you can work through the next three weeks together. Some of you may have goals that don't fit within a certain parameter and you may get someone with a very different goal but hopefully you can still encourage each other, too!

Please note that I will not be moderating partners beyond matching you up. If you have a non-responsive partner or things go off the rails I can't sort it out or rematch you once the matches have been set.

**I'm type-A/an overachiever/super excited for this...what can I do to work ahead?**

As I mentioned before... the real point of this is to Love Yourself. So for the next two weeks, I want you to start thinking about how you love yourself, and also places you love yourself more. I also want you to think about what makes you feel loved in life, and how you like to show love to other people (this can be different for some people!)  
**Here's some concrete action steps:**  


1. Set down your phone face down, or close your laptop or walk away from your desktop.

2. Grab a pen/pencil and a piece of paper (we're going analog here, folks!) and divide that piece of paper into four sections in a way that makes sense to you. In my exercise, I folded my paper into four sections.

3. Label three of the sections: Things I love about myself, Ways I show Love, Ways I feel loved. Leave the fourth one blank for now. Now...go to town on each of those sections. Make a list, draw pictures, whatever you need or want. Be detailed, be broad. In a culture that tells us not to think about what makes us wonderful for fear of being seen as prideful it might take a while for us to fill in the love yourself list but I challenge you to sit there and *really*sit there until something shows up for you. Don't get distracted by your phone. This is important work. Do you love that you don't have to use an eyelash curler on your eyelashes? Do you love that you can get all the lyrics right of a song sung in a language you don't speak? Do you love that you're working on your degree in something or holding it down professionally? There is nothing to big or too small to list. I challenge you to find 20 ways to love yourself, five ways you love others, and five ways you feel loved.  


4. Now lets think about that last section. Don't worry about labeling it, but number your section 1 - 7. List seven or fewer things you think you might need to work on, ways you don't love yourself. I am going to limit you to this number because I don't want you spiraling or going down a rabbit hole that you can't get yourself out of. And at the end of these seven I want you to go back and read the 20 things you just wrote down about yourself that you love. It's important to be aware of the ways that you love yourself, but it's also important to be aware of the things we need to work on. Circle two or three of these seven that might become the thing you want to work on during this challenge. It could be something personal - you struggle with FOMO, you feel like you're not as good as someone else you see out there. If you're like me it might be something physical - For example, I struggle with really, really bad skin and I have a tough time when I look in the mirror at my acne-scarred face so I need to address that. Maybe you hate your job or you're scared to make a move professionally or academically and it's making you unhappy.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Now you've finished the groundwork for goal setting. In two weeks the first post will launch and I'll walk you through goal setting and partner you up if that's something you'd like to join.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future Posts:**

Week 1: Goal Setting

Week 2: Action Planning

Week 3: Encouraging Ourselves When it's Difficult

Week 4: Wrap Up and Moving Forward

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** In the spirit of Bangtan's UN speech and it being the LY era, let's work on loving ourselves more in 2019. I'll be putting weekly posts up to walk anyone who wants to join me through this starting on Dec. 31st. ",95,1,False,self,,,,,

833,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2018-12-19,2018,12,19,2,a7d3hn,self.bangtan,"After watching BTS' MMA 2018 performance, I had these questions in mind. How will I feel if I saw a similar, traditionally-themed performance showcasing my culture? Will I feel proud?",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/a7d3hn/after_watching_bts_mma_2018_performance_i_had/,hayleymello,1545153816,"*~~Haha I've got a feeling that I might receive some backlash for posting this, anyway, here goes nothing since I'm legit curious =)~~*

&amp;#x200B;

After Idol was released, watching their performance on MMA this year, watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2Kq2oNgjNY) explaining their MMA performance and other videos explaining Korean traditional culture and references, this question really hit me. My answer to my questions would be... maybe, it might be kind of cool....? But honestly, I would not be interested. I'll feel very... meh. 

I do see some similarities between my culture (Chinese) and the Korean culture, like the lion dance, the  (Haegeum) and the  (Er Hu), as showcased in this [explanatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoCl-UvtM80) video of their MMA performance. So the elements in their performance aren't entirely new to me in a sense. But it's still very cool to see an idol group do that, I'll consider it one of the firsts I've ever seen in my \~9 years of being a K-pop fan. 

Being ethnically Chinese, I feel that it's not really important/necessary to be in touch with my Chinese roots. Which is why I was very surprised that they put out something so... tradition/culture related this year for Idol. I know for sure that they are proud to be Koreans, but putting out something like that, I could've never imagined. They are so in touch with their roots, which is admirable I also realised that Koreans seem to know quite a fair bit about their traditions and culture, while here, people, including me, don't even really know our traditional music instruments. I've only ever been introduced to them briefly in elementary school and I only know  and  (Gu Zheng), and that's it. What I know of my culture is barely scraping the surface.

It could be because I live in such an ethnically diverse country, as compared to Korea, where the majority there are well..., Koreans. Perhaps that's why there isn't really a need for me to be so in touch with my roots. Not that being Chinese is nothing to be proud of, but just that my culture is not really of any importance in my life. Rather than saying that I'm Chinese, I'd say that I'm from (my country) instead. I don't know how to explain it but it's kind of a ""nationality vs ethnicity"" kind of thing *(If anyone can put this in words, I'll be grateful lol my brain can't function right now).* Honestly, the most in touch with my Chinese roots that I've ever been is only during Chinese New Year and that's only once a year.

With that, I feel like I only thought that their performance was cool and that Idol was great because I'm biased, so whatever the boys do, I'll like it. Because if the table were turned and if it were to be a Chinese group putting up a performance relating back to Chinese culture, it's very likely that I will not be interested at all. Even though as stated above, there are similar elements (i.e instruments, musicality wise, singing wise), but oddly (and maybe, sadly), I won't be interested.

Throwing back the question to anyone here who wants to entertain my mind (ahahaha), what do you think? If a group like them came from your country, were to put up a traditionally themed performance and music like they did, would you feel proud? Would you be intrigued? How will you feel? =) ",74,1,False,self,,,,,

In exactly a month's time I will be seeing BTS live for the first time! Never thought I'd live to see this day tbh, when BTS didn't visit SG for the Wings Tour I didn't think they'd come at all. I am really really looking forward to it, but I have no idea how I am going to react/feel when they appear on stage - although I know at some point (or maybe throughout?) I will be crying. I think that's because I'm just too used to seeing them on my tiny screen, and so I don't know if I can handle the amplification of my feelings seeing them in real life.

So yes! I just wish for everyone to please share with me your experiences seeing them live for the first time. I want to know how and what you felt when the boys appeared, when they bantered irl, when you saw their smile/tears in flesh. Did it feel surreal? Did you cry? Did you feel empty afterwards? I'd really love to know :)",157,1,False,self,,,,,

What's your reason?,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/a7ie9t/who_is_not_going_to_the_bts_world_tour_love/,intheshadows-,1545188586,"This is a question for all ARMYs around the world, but I'll talk specifically about Australia as that is where I am.

I've noticed that in Australia at least, tickets don't seem to be selling well at all. When ""Burn The Stage"" was announced in cinema, A LOT more seats were sold during the same time period. So I'm confused as to why not many people seem to be going this time around? Especially as this is a one-day only event, and ""Burn The Stage"" had more runs... you'd think a lot more seats would be booked out by now, since it's so limited. But that's not the case at all. (FYI: Tickets were already on sale in Australia the same day it was announced last week, despite the ""official"" release being yesterday.)

I called Event Cinemas up and they told me that if ticket sales don't pick up, they'll have to start removing sessions. And there aren't that many sessions to begin with. :(

**So I'm super curious: If you are NOT planning to attend, what's your reason?**

Or are there any reasons people can think of as to why the sales for this seem so poor compared to ""Burn The Stage""? Maybe it's due to Christmas time and people are busy with their families and haven't had time to look at this? I don't know. I'm genuinely confused as to the (current) poor sales. I'm personally more excited about this (a BTS concert in Vmax!!!) than I was for the tour doco. So... I'm at a loss.

If you're planning to see the film, please book your seats to show demand!

Im working on a large project related to a couple of kpop groups and specifically focused on BTS. Im looking for people to help me do research along with some other tasks and I figured ARMYs might want to help out. There are a couple of requirements but theyre pretty loose.

1. You *must* be willing/able to sign non-disclose agreements. At the moment you wont need to but it might be necessary in the future.

2. You need to put some effort into your work and be (fairly) good with deadlines. I get that life happens and if something comes up thats totally fine but stuff needs to get done.

If youre interested please let me know! I wish I could tell you more but this project is going to be fairly long term (looking at 1-2 years rn) and everything is under wraps for at least the next 6 months. Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks!  ",18,1,False,self,,,,,

ive tried to keep up a happy streak and after a hand full of tries during my 4 years of agony. 3 weeks was my max.   
i know my limits and i knew i tried my best. especially during college when i was most eager to just stand back up on my feet.   
shit happens and sometimes your happiness is not in your hands 

for years now, i felt the active necessity to aggressively and consistently color my world. I still do and I always wonder why i end up spending hours writing a single poem/song, or grinding out meanings from a bts song. It's because i refuse to give up.   
Revitalize means to put life back into where it once was.

*I want to* ***color*** *my world again.*

I remember waking up everyday to ask myself if I cared and if I wanted to continue to strive for a dream that seemed to push me away. I never gave up, but this one sided love really pushed me to limits ...and it still does.

it made my world colorless

One of the most important life lines that reached out to me was **BTS**.

Remember those TV scenes where you're walking past a TV shop, and you see something on a hundred little screens. And it so happens to captivate your heart?   
That was me.   
       ( DNA )   
it felt like it was coincidental: their love yourself message right when i wanted to really let go of my dreams  
Their love yourself album was so vibrant and colorful. it sparked hope.

But it wasnt just  a coincidence.   
We are all struggling with our battles. No one is always happy.

Recently at the 2018 Hong Kong MAMA, BTS had revealed that even after they had tasted happiness. they were not fully healed.   
As shocked as we all were, it seems inevitable that in life shit happens.   
But the inevitable and forever ongoing cycle of BTS healing ARMY, and ARMY healing BTS lives on.

For myself, for fellow army, and for anyone who wishes to revitalize their world I would like to propose a challenge.   
\#projectrevitalize   
As I said before: 3 weeks was the most I could last in my ""happy streak"" but I understand this can vary for everyone...sooo

why dont we use our beloved rainbow!!

Red, Orange, yellow, green, blue, \****purple\****

each day on social media or in private, rep a color.   
Post a picture of something red, wear red, color your bullet journal day red. But do something you enjoy.   
I will wear one color everyday, something vibrant and beautiful. A lovely red dress, for example.   
And post it with #projectrevitalize

at the end of our cycle, we will be greeted with our favorite purple, always reminding ourselves of .   
(perhaps we can time it so that purple falls on Tae Hyungs Birthday)

This is a project I would like to share with ARMY, so I would love input :)

Been a while, eh? We wanted to update you on the new campaign but were waiting for the former campaign results which took... well most of the month to get actually, hah! BUT we're here now and we have great stuff to tell!

This month's campaign is in honor of Jin's birthday and it supports an org called Purple Community Fund. P-C-F works in the Philippines (and Tanzania but we're focusing on PH), and runs several programs in some of the most impoverished communities in Manila and Baidu, including mentoring, health, food, and the program we're supporting called the Community Skills &amp; Livelihood Programme. Basically what they do is provide skills training which allows people (at first women but now also men) to provide for themselves and to become financially independent with their own businesses. We chose this specifically for Jin because of not only his hardworking nature, but also his entrepreneurial spirit; being the son of a businessman, and having recently opened his own business with his brother.

Added to all of that, the ""Purple"" in the name of the org just seemed like a sign. :D When we were searching business/entrepreneur types of orgs, it practically jumped out at us.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the current campaign thread w/info, link to donate, link to the org shop (seriously check out the cool stuff they make!) and the google doc for tracking: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1068519974191263744](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1068519974191263744)

We recently ran a survey to try to see how we can serve ARMY better, and one of the things people wanted were more updates during the month, so since the donation page doesn't show updates in real time, we've been giving updates about twice a week. At last count, we had 296 donors, and had raised enough to provide 24 (nearly 25) people with the opportunity to learn a new skill to support themselves and their communities.

One of the unique thing this organization does is teach the women to make artisan handcrafts, which are sold on the org website, and 100% of the profits are re-invested into the program to help others. They focus on using recycled materials, and one of the things they use to make beautiful bags, jewelry, and other items are pull tabs from pop cans!

Our activity this month is in collaboration with BTS\_AHC (you guys know them right?) and it's called #MyJinspiration, where we are encouraging ARMYs to reflect on self-love, things we love about our past &amp; present selves, things we hope to improve, and what we hope for our futures. If you're on twitter, give the HT a look, people have shared some really lovely stories and letters to their past and future selves! Some are posting themselves, some are sending them anonymously to an email provided by AHC, who posts for them: [https://twitter.com/BTS\_AHC/status/1075521443750928384](https://twitter.com/BTS_AHC/status/1075521443750928384)

Oh oh I almost forgot! ShareTheMeal! A while back we started a team on the UN World Food Programme app ShareTheMeal, and we started a challenge called the #EatJinChallenge. You can search teams for One In An ARMY, choose 'Give for this team' and then choose where you want your donation to go. Many are choosing Yemen because of the crisis there. It costs $0.50 to feed one child for one day. You can download the app and give whenever you want. Feel free to join the team!

On Jin's birthday, we reminded ARMY about it, and everyone really got behind it. To date, ARMYs giving for the OIAA Team have provided **over 12,000** meals for hungry children around the world! It was pretty cool, 2 days ago another ARMY randomly stumbled on the team while giving on their own and were so surprised to find an ARMY team, they posted about it, and someone eventually directed them to us. :D [https://twitter.com/uwuseokie/status/1075119573194760193](https://twitter.com/uwuseokie/status/1075119573194760193)

I usually just watch their videos if I need something to watch. I almost always listen to their songs if I need music to listen to. It's not to say that I don't like western music anymore! It just that I would rather listen to their songs (or kpop in general). I'm not sure why this is and was wondering if others are like that as well? 

BTS are also the first celebrities who I have been so emotionally invested in. Honestly, I'm surprised at myself since I don't think I have ever really followed any other celebrity, artist, group, actor, etc, the way that I actively follow BTS. 

Any other feel in the same way? What makes them so different? And are there any western celebrities you can even compare them to?",65,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm posting on behalf of the BTS Collective AU. We're in fact a collective of seven friends based in Australia who met via this subreddit; one by one through our search for local ARMYs on weekly threads, and then conclusively through the amazing charity project [ARMYMustServe](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8ipqw5/fifth_anniversary_project_armymustserve/). This community is therefore incredibly close to our hearts.

This year was so significant for us and the boys that we put together a hype reel to celebrate some of their biggest achievements with, and self-funded the first ever Australian billboard in World Square shopping complex in the heart of Sydney, Australia. Were unbelievably proud of the incredible year they have had, and if you happen to be swinging by Sydney, feel free to [drop by this billboard](https://twitter.com/BTScollectiveAU/status/1072023122335850496) and celebrate with us, too! (SAY HI, WE LOVE FRIENDS.)

Even if youre not in Sydney, we want to share that pride with as many ARMY as possible, so we did an [online video release](https://twitter.com/BTScollectiveAU/status/1075194364652007425). Check it out \o/ 

Were always keen to hear from anyone who might have fresh ideas for our next project, so drop us a tweet or DM anytime.

Here's to ARMY friendship and an excellent 2018, r/bangtan! ",14,1,False,self,,,,,

I think on the opposite ends of the spectrum are Yoongi and Taehyung. Yoongi being this disciplined direct type person, while Taehyung is a much more eccentric and carefree person with everyone other's personalities sort of in between each other. 

But going off from that the rap line seem really close with each other. Hoseok definitely has a serious side behind the playful demeanor and I think both Yoongi and Namjoon appreciate that. Although they don't outwardely show it, Yoongi and Namjoon seem to have a pretty intense friendship. 

Taehyung and Jimin seem to really like each other and I know they've known each other for a long time. Jin seems to be the guy who is good terms with everyone and acts as a second leader to Namjoon, but doesn't seem to have a best friend like others in the group have(I could definitely be wrong though).  I think everyone also likes Jungkook and see him as a little brother they can take under their wing.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your top 10 must hear songs for a rap line concert? Including but not limited to the mixtapes, special releases on soundcloud, or any previous song from a BTS album. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mine are, in no partidular order:

1. Cypher 4 (I'll never forget this experience on the wings tour)

2. Ddaeng

3. Tear

4. Daydream (Jhope)

5. The Last (Agust D)

6. Tony Montana (Agust D)

7. Baseline - (Jhope) (I'll be screaming this at the top of my lungs) 

8. Hopeworld - (Jhope)

9. So Far Away (Agust A)

10. Seoul (RM) (my most recent favorite on repeat)

&amp;#x200B;

Runnerups are Cypher 3, Her, and Joke (I can't help it guys)  I feel like I'm forgetting some other important ones... 

&amp;#x200B;

Bighit if you're listening to my prayers, please bring all the guys along and have them guest appearance every other song. I would pay good money just to watch them all goof around and have fun while the rapline kills it.

I have read multiple instances and posts that delving deep into BTS journey itself has helped various people deal with their depressive disorder, but we know that anxiety disorder is a different psychological illness and is the #1 trigger of mental health issues for the global population. I experience this personally and although stanning BTS has helped me calm down most times, but dealing with people is still largely very frightening and a lot of times I genuinely avoid it.  


To be more specific, the interest of my post is to tease how some of you who understand anxiety disorder, feels encouraged through BTS journey to take the first leap and combat the anxiety that's been drowning you? Thank you.

Since Princess has the whole ""real life"" thing going on, I took over this time! And similar to Princess, I'll be running this separate from the mod team and just as a user.

I'll post the categories here in advance, so you have time to think about your nominations (and maybe sit on those ""best x of 2018"" discussions a little longer). They are almost the same as last year with the addition of a handful of subreddit-specific categories. There might still be some minor changes later.

The eligibility period is January 1st, 2018 - December 31st, 2018. If you need more context for these categories, you can check out [the wiki page for the previous year](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/bangtanawards17).

I'll post more details about how this will exactly work when we get closer to the event. Unless something crazy happens that sets us all on fire, it will probably be around early/mid-January during a relative lull in content.

If you have some suggestions or questions, let me know. If not, start thinking about nominations (and remember the earlier half of 2018 had a lot happening too)!

Here's mine:



*A paid version of Ddaeng to be released so that we can chart it. (A remix maybe?)



* Idol MMA traditional music remix. (Paid so we can chart.)



* A Love Yourself in North America tour dvd. Realistically this would probably be Citifield, but I want a bonus of all the unique ending ments during the tour from other stops. (LA for the original english script, and then the stops where they just started talking in Korean and letting the translator do the work.) Also highlights of best performances or moments from other stops on the tour. I know BigHit mainly releases dvds for Korea and Japan, but US &amp; Canada ARMY this year was no joke.



*A dvd of dance practices that were playing at the BTS exhibition. Yes it will include the free ones online, but I would still marathon that so hard to see other unreleased dance practices since I will never see the exhibition.

I heard about BTS probably about 2-3 years ago but was never what people would consider a Stan but wouldnt skip a kpop song if it played on one of my playlists. 

About 6/8 months ago,  my (ex) boyfriend and I were going through a rough patch. We had recently bought a house together, bought a puppy and all those other steps that adults take around the time they want to settle down. I was heavily invested in this relationship; emotionally, physically and mentally. 

BUT as much as we loved each other, we just couldnt make it work. It became very clear that my (ex) boyfriend and I were falling apart as a couple but becoming more like acquaintances. Have you ever ached for someone so close in reach but yet so far emotionally? We tried every avenue and option to make it work but ultimately, sometimes two people that love each other, cant have a fairytale ending. 

It goes without saying that I was in a very bad place mentally.  My mind was playing games for both sides of the equation and I lost all self worth. I tried everything in my power to salvage a 6.5 year relationship to no avail. I lost myself in the process. 

One day, when I was on one of my very long drives to nowhere (to clear my mind); Fake Love played on my playlist. I thought to myself how fitting this song was to my situation. Coincidentally, Let Go played right after it. I dont know if it was the universe that was sending me some sort message but I had never had lyrics really speak to me like Fake Love and Let Go did. 

Whatever doubts and questions I had in my  head, these  songs cleared and pathed the way to what I really needed to know. 

I realised that I didnt have to settle for anything less and that  I shouldnt have to apologise for who I am and what I felt. 

And now here I am; heart broken, boxes packed, removalists booked... but a fire burning within me thats impatient to find out what the future has in store for me. 

And I cant thank BTS enough for kindling the fire. 

ps I would love to know what BTS has made you realise that has affected your life on a significant level.

What do you think the creative process is for BTS &amp; BigHit? Naturally, the music comes first, but I'm wondering whether the choreography comes straight after, or the stage design for televised performances (there's different background music for different award shows + adjusted choreo). And then when do they find time for the members to practice, or design &amp; order their costumes, or train their background dancers, or hire that troupe of classical Korean dancers for MMA. 

And on a little bit of a separate note, what do you think is the timeline for production of RUN BTS episodes? How long does it take to edit? How long does it take to film? Same thing for summer packages, and festa, and literally everything else. 

And if you have an insight/experience in other aspects of their work that would be greatly appreciated too! I'm really just trying to understand how everything gets put together. 

^(As someone who deals with a ton of logistics (think large venue reservations, catering, getting people places on time) for work, thinking about how BTS puts together their final product gives me a headache. I'm a relatively new ARMY and I'm just flabbergasted by the amount of content BTS puts out or prepares. Since I became an ARMY during LY:Tear, I wasn't able to use hair to tell the members apart when I was still learning about them, but I learned to use hair colors to put together a rough timeline of when things happen (like ... GrapeJoon = Not Today/Spring Day). But that just made me realize how much they produce in so little time?! It takes my work like 3 weeks to approve a 3 minute video, so, to put it crassly, wtf??)",29,1,False,self,,,,,

lmao. Kpop is not a culture nor a genre. Kpop is an industry. under *only* that sole classification can BTS be considered Kpop, and even then the genre often limits the artist on reaching their full potential. For example, BTS in the US and elsewhere, will in the near future, only be defined as Kpop by their peers and industry professionals alike, due to the strict definitions that the west has set in their definition of Kpop. Kpop is not a Korean termbut was created by western journalists and critics as a blanket term to define any kind of Korean music, this is seen as Tiger JK's most recent album being labeled Kpop, and Lyn, a whole ballad singer having the same label placed on herthese two are the furthest from Kpop there is. By saying that BTS is Kpop, you are basically upholding western supremacy by refusing to distinguish the multiple genres that are within the South Korean music industrythat does not give artists within the Korean music industry room to grow and distinguish themselves under the belts of multiple genres, which BTS is attempting to do, as Yoongi has previously said in their interview at the Grammy Museum:""Thus we dont want to label our music as a certain genre or limit it to K-pop, but would like to make a new category for it if possible.""",11,1,False,self,,,,,

I was planning to just enjoy BTS music and their goofy personality. But, once you are in you can't ignore the fact about haters throwing accusation and stuff at BTS. I'm pretty offended basically. Not that I know better or something but wow I'm just pretty pissed sometimes. I barely reply to a single hater I saw on FB or any site. But reading them have triggered my anger like ""don't you have better stuff to do than making fanwars or saying negative shit?"" sometimes I feel like some other ARMys are also putting too much. Why?

My picks:

\- ""Young forever"" (they are always conscious about their success and its ephemeralness);

\- ""Sea""; ""Path"" and ""Ma city"" (I grouped them together because I feel they represent their roots);

\- ""2!3!"", as what kept them going through the hardest times of their career is ""hoping for more good days"";

\- ""Piece of piece pt.1"" (although it's in Hobi's mixtape I feel it represents very well the whole group as a ""declaration of intent""... I would not be surprised to find ""P.O.P pt.2"" in one of their next releases).

This is INSANE considering the Wings tour ""only"" had a total attendance of 550k people and there are more dates to come.

Here's how I've come to that number:

Korea 90.000 Tickets (confirmed)
North America 220.000 Tickets (confirmed)
Europe 100.000 Tickets (confirmed)
Japan 380.000 Tickets (confirmed)
Taiwan 50.000 Tickets (confirmed)
Hong Kong 50.000 Tickets (estimated)
Thailand +80.000 Tickets (confirmed)
Singapore +40.000 Tickets (estimated)

The record for most attended concert tour by a korean act holds Bigbang with an attendance of 1.5m people. Their tour lasted a whole year and over 900k people came from Japan alone!

Do you guys think we could possibly break that record? 

All of the announced tour dates are currently sold out so I really wonder when they are going to release the next tour dates since there are so many countries left where BTS could perform in a stadium (Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Macau, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, Chile or basically Latin America etc...)  and how many more dates they've actually planned before ending the tour.

Which country do you think is next? I personally think that they are now focusing on Asia so I think  Malaysia and the Philippines are next!",15,1,False,self,,,,,

BTS puts so much effort in their performances and give 100% no matter what. I was rewatching MAMA 2017 and each one of the members are dripping in sweat, completely out of breath by the end of it. 

It seems in 2018 they got a lot better about conserving their energy, but they still give it a 100%. By the time Melon Music Awards came around I thought there was no way they'd be able to put out a unique performance and it'd be a rehash of the past(not like that's a bad thing, the boys have already pushed themselves a lot), but they outdid themselves again. That whole J-hope, Jimin, and Jungkook sequence with traditional Korean dance just completely blew my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's just the thing with BTS though, they put so much work behind the scenes to put a unique and captivating performance every time and I think they really do it for the fans. It isn't a level I've seen from American artists in a long time and they seem to blow the water with that with other Kpop artists. They're only in their mid to early 20s too, and I'm really excited to see what other unique ways they find to push themselves/put out performances

Just attempt to bear with my thirsty rants, OK?)

I fell in love with BTS a few weeks ago. More specifically, a certain member who graces the title of this post caught my eye and my heart in a matter of seconds, pulling me away from all responsibilities and flinging me into a wild tangle of fangirl-hood. Needless to say, I've become... a more than a little parched. In fact, I spent the whole past weekend chugging bottles of water and binge-watching Jungkook focus- cams.

Yet, with the interspersed breaks of BTS fluff videos, I made an observation. With the other members, their appearances (face, body) stay pretty much the same for me both on-stage and off-stage. Yet Jungkook, the maknae, so [UWU](https://youtu.be/bLMlyCov3Go), adorable and youthful (so [Jungshook](https://youtu.be/JHKWQP_aqF8?t=430)) looking during Run- BTS and vlogs (even with make-up!) suddenly transforms when on stage? Watch [this](https://youtu.be/0sDFpVrwaw4) or [this](https://youtu.be/jS4VvJtQ6qc?t=165) (ARREST ME) or [(   )](https://youtu.be/HQaU3GU4l5s?t=100) and you'll understand what I mean. (Especially [this](https://youtu.be/1trWV3dNXe0?t=266) one. Like WTF. One word, you guys: **thosebodyrollstho**. His facial expressions? His rhythm? His deep, glaring stare that seems to penetrate every crevice of your body and mind? I am feeling emotions that should not come to someone who is of reasonable conscience)

His persona changes like crazy, he looks super grown-up, mature, and just has this charisma that is so powerful and sexy.  His gaze catches me off guard- it is so perforating and piercing and you can tell he just knows how he [smack](https://youtu.be/RIDWklLoudc?t=3)s ARMY wild with lust (then shameful self-reflection upon remembering how young he is.) How does someone have that kind of duality? It's as if he just switches bodies and faces and auras whenever he steps on stage. (Or maybe I'm just thirsty after that Airplane pt 2. entrance at MAMA)

Please tell me I am not alone in feeling this deep within my soul. Does anyone else notice this insane, abrupt, just ***rude*** transformation emerging from within Jungkook while he's on stage? Or should I just wallow in self-shame and start stanning anime characters instead)",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I love the boys so much and wish for them to be happy, and I truly love and appreciate them with all my heart. I discovered them in 2015 and they have helped me a lot with my depression and anxiety, and given me motivation to pursue my dreams / work harder. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was absolutely ruined after going to their concert. The next day, I was holed up in my room bawling my eyes out with the realization that I love them. So. Much.  And it made me feel scared. You know how Jin said they were close to disbanding? Yeah, that made me even more scared. This is my first time being so invested in a group / band / celebrities and honestly I don't know what to do. I'm only 16 so I don't even have a good grasp on the different types of love one can feel.

In 7 years I will be 23  still young and probably as nave and prone to emotional attachment as I am now  and I'm pretty sure if I keep on loving them like this I will be destroyed and devastated once the time for them to disband comes.

As we're still in the most festive season of the year and I found myself in the possession of a little extra something that I don't need, I'd like to give back to the community that gives to me daily, and hand it out to one lucky ARMY out here!

&gt;[Ta-dah!](https://i.imgur.com/zUQLIfx.jpg)

It's a **Love Yourself: HER** album, 'O' ver. It's brand new  opened but never played, and looked through only to see the photocard. It contains everything: the photobook, cd, photocard (let's keep this one a surprise, shall we?), notes, stickers and comes with a folded poster.

There are only three tiny rules to enter:

1. Leave a comment under this post. Just to add a little fun to it: how about you show us your absolute favorite photo of your bias? Only one!
2. Since I'm Europe-based and I'll be paying for the shipping myself, I'd like to limit it only to ARMY who are residents of Europe.
3. *PLEASE*, sign up for the giveaway only if you truly want the album, not because you're planning to re-sell it. I kind of really like the idea that this will come to the hands of someone who's day is going to be made by receiving it.

**Deadline: 2nd January 2019, 11:59PM KST.**

The winner is going to be chosen by a random number generator sometime on the 3rd January  I'll post it as an edit and message the winner privately.

Just dropping by to talk about the campaign we are doing for January for Tae's birthday- #HealWithTaehyung. We launched it a little early on his actual birthday, but are still running Jin's through the end of the month. 

For Taehyung, we are partnering with an organization called CHAP, Children's Healing Art Project. They provide in-and-out-of-hospital interactive healing arts programs to children, teens, and families affected by pediatric illness, disability, or special need. All of their programs are provided free of charge to the families involved. CHAP wants to help each child find their voice through the artistic process. With his passion for art (photography, drawing, and fashion design) it seemed like a natural fit to pick a non-profit that helps children through art.

Here is the current campaign thread w/info, link to donate, and the google doc for tracking: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1079029299880099840](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1079029299880099840)

And here is the video for this month's campaign on the OneInAnARMY Youtube account: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKRrqyA7rr0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKRrqyA7rr0)

&amp;#x200B;

For our extra activity this month, we are doing #TaegersForKids. We will be sending encouraging tiger-themed cards and letters to the children at OHSU's Doernbecher Children's Hospital where CHAP holds art programs. We created a handful of templates with different pictures and quotes that you all are free to color and use and add your text or just draw your own! Templates and info about where to mail the cards are in this thread: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1079473606143430656](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1079473606143430656)
