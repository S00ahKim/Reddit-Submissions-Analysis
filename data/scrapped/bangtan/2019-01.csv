It goes from Jan. to Dec., with several events mentioned for each month. There are links to content throughout, so it's actually quite a good omnibus for people who'd like to find new footage or notable dates they may not have known about. It also reminded me of that Ed Sheeran thing I'd forgotten about (these boys are too busy....).

*The year of 2018 was undeniably a major success for South Korean group* [*BTS*](https://www.billboard.com/music/bts)*.*

*Every  other day or so it felt like new music was coming out or new records  were being broken by the seven men,RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V, Jimin and  Jungkook. From topping the Billboard 200 twice to speaking at the United  Nations about self-affirmation, heres a look back at just a few of the  things that happened to and around BTS and their fan ARMY over the past  12 months.*

I knew a little about Kpop but didnt want to give BTS a chance because of my highly reactive hipster bone that prevents me from indulging in any type of activity if more than 17 people know of its existence as well- Yes, its a bit of problem As dramatic as it may seem, these past 12 months have really been something special to me. Im not only an ARMY, but BTS alone has contributed to many milestones Ive overcome in the past year. I started dancing; practicing pieces from many of their music videos **AND OH MY GOD! Was I some ass at dancing last year. I couldnt do a simple forward shuffle, body line was all jacked up, My damn spongebobs looked like doodlebops!-** Point is: Ive improved a lot. Some people who laughed at me before for attempting to do I Need U and Just One Day were blown away when I preformed Idol and Dope and our Christmas party a week ago. **Ay! You shoulda saw em when I pulled out the the Blood Sweat and Tear Jungkook and Jimin handstand! OHHHH WAS I HYPED THAT NIGHT!**

Its just crazy Im sitting here reminiscing on 12 months like some veteran telling his grand kids about the war- Boy, you just some amateur dancer in the 11th grade! I still remember the times when I kept mixing up the names of Jimin, Jin and Jungkook; thinking 2014 memes were cool to say 3 years later; wondering How tf are all their last names Hyung? ;and lastly the short but highly embarrassing period of time when I pronounced Yoongi as  and *(Put that into Google translate to hear the horror)*. I feel like Ive grown so much as person. Figuratively and literally lol Jimin was taller than me when I  first became a stan, and now I stand the same height as Hobi. Last year I felt like I was just in some sort of limbo. Drifting day to day, but with the help of artist like BTS and their amazing choreographers I found my new passion and love for dancing. I love ARMY and I love you BTS. Here's to another great year with the boys![](https://emojipedia.org/purple-heart/)

Most celebrities go as guests for specific designers or fashion houses. If thats the case, which fashion house do you think would bring BTS?

And how do you think they would handle the theme Notes on Camp.

For those not familiar with the Met Gala, here is a trailer for a documentary on it.

Here is the essay the theme is inspired by:

So this year do you have any resolutions for your ARMY life ? I'm not that great when it comes to following my New Year resolutions , yet every year I make new ones completely ignoring the ones that are yet to be met lol. 

Anyway, this year my resolutions as an ARMY are basically two 

1. Develop a more responsible and      healthy stan lifestyle. Which includes avoiding procrastination in BTS' name, spending less time on the internet and  avoiding  obsessively saving every single fansite picture ( because my phone needs to breathe)

2. Join the fancafe. I've been putting it off for the longest time. I'll give it a shot this year,despite the fact that I can't recall half of the passwords for various other accounts on the internet. Lol.

So these are my very basic resolutions. Share some of your ARMY resolutions for the year. Let's see how many we can meet by the end of the year.

I was looking up tinted lip balms on Sephora, and imagine my utter shock at seeing a Bobbi Brown lip balm having multiple reviews that mention JungKook (some even with photos). ARMY were not shy in talking about their love for JK and BTS or in telling people to stream their music. For example:

*From EmilyMx*

*I KNEW JUNGKOOK HAD TASTE*

*I  bought this product after seeing Jungkook from BTS use it and it truly  is amazing, it leaves my lips radiant and smooth. Jungkook has great  taste but wbk. Stream IDOL for clear skin.*

I've always had a thing against monetising reaction videos, because they're pretty low-effort and also because they capitalise on work that aren't theirs. I think they're fine on their own, but it gets problematic when these channels are obviously money-grabbers capitalising on BTS's huge fanbase.

i laughed so hard at this because I definitely went through a phase like this.  I had no problem identifying RM in pictures and quizzes, but I had a tough time telling the difference between V, Jungkook and Jin, and also a tough time with Jimin and Suga.  And  due to changes in hair colour and/or camera angles, I think I've confused everyone with everyone at some point or other.

I honestly didn't know that they released so much in one year. Our boys are working hard! I tried to list all their songs from 2018, but please let me know if I missed any and I can add them to this list. Good luck trying to pick only 5.

As you may have seen, MBC has posted several videos promoting King of Masked Singer (a TV show) and its new version in the U.S., and BTS has promoted this show. (Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L79s5PXZ1\_I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L79s5PXZ1_I)) This has stirred up some controversy (from what I have seen through forums and comments) in the K-army community.

Many K-army are quite angry with this, given that MBC has used an SM group to end the Gayo Music Festival (), instead of BTS, which is quite a big deal here in Korea because the last performance usually comes from the most well-respected/famous group (some people say this was due to seniority, but DBSK, the ""oldest"" group that performed, was not the ending group). MBC has then asked BTS (and not any SM ent groups) to promote their show as they know that this will attract more viewers. The K-army have also pointed out that BTS had to perform in both Parts 1 and 2 of the festival (only group to do so), meaning their performance was split and they had to go on stage twice. In addition to this, seeing from Bangtan's clothes in the video, this did not seem like an official, planned promotion but rather something they were asked to do straight after a performance/between performances. As a result, some fans are calling the company ""SMBC"" because of their seeming bias towards SM, and have been insulting and criticizing the company very harshly for ""using"" BTS, after giving them poor treatment during the festival.

I was surprised that this did not get much attention from International Army, and I wanted to know your thoughts on the matter! I thought it was interesting given the current context of companies/brands/people who are seen as basically using the BTS name to gain attraction and fame, rather than actually respecting BTS as a group. There are also some more detailed comments in English in the comments section of the video, which may be more helpful to understand the situation. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

172,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2019-1-5,2019,1,5,15,acrq2w,self.bangtan,Just wondering if Im the only one who hasnt been enjoying BTS recent music,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/acrq2w/just_wondering_if_im_the_only_one_who_hasnt_been/,slaybram,1546670672,"So Ive been following BTS music since 2015, I got introduced to them through Boy In Luv and through that song I fell in love with them. I then went back and listened to their debut and everything they had released up until then and since 2015 Ive been a fan of their music. My favourite album of theirs is Dark &amp; Wild with You Never Walk Alone as a close second. They were literally the reason I started listening to K-Pop and I loved every single project they released up until You Never Walk Alone. 

With the release of DNA and Love Yourself: Her however, Ive felt a bit uneasy with their music. DNA didnt stand out to me as a song and I plain just didnt like it. I felt like the melody was uninspired, the beat drop was flat and boring and the song itself was just weak in my opinion. Then as I listened to that album, of course the lyrics were on point (once I searched the translations) and the performances were outstanding (the boys have only improved with their vocals, rapping and dancing) but the song writing aspect of their music felt bland. Songs like Dimple, Pied Piper and Go, Go, albeit being catchy, after multiple listens got boring and felt too repetitive. I did enjoy Mic Drop though but even that song got boring after the Steve Aoki Remix was released. 

Then Love Yourself: Tear came out and I started having a little hope. Fake Love was awesome and full of passion, songs like Singularity, 134340, Paradise, Airplane Pt. 2, Anpanman and Tear were all great and I thoroughly enjoyed them (although the beat for Anpanman did sound a bit like a rip off of Migos Stir Fry).

But THEN Love Yourself: Answer came and crushed my hopes. I didnt enjoy any of the new songs on there. None of the trivias stood out to me, the full versions of the solos didnt add anything and overall, to me, it seems like BTS needs a break. 

With each new release since their debut, BTS has constantly been evolving their sound. Moving from straight Hip-Hop, to Pop-Rock Hip-Hop, to straight Pop Hip-Hop and now it seems like theyre stuck. Theyve stayed with the sound from You Never Walk Alone and are re-cycling that sound. 

With constant, non-stop comebacks, I think theyre over exhausting their brain pool. They need to be away from constant music releases for a little bit, rest, go back to the drawing board and come up with something thats either a reinvented call back to their old sound, or evolve their sound further like theyve done in the past. 

Right now, they sound like theyre trying trying to capitalise off the success which You Never Walk Alone gave them. Which is fine, that albums release time was when they started gaining major global traction and they needed to capitalise off of it to gain popularity. Now, however, theyre at a point where they can afford to take a break, there isnt as much momentum to lose now than if they had taken a break back then. 

I know all of what Im saying is most likely futile, BTS is gaining in popularity and fans with their current sound and so maybe they dont want to change it. Also, there doesnt seem to be any sort of out cry from the fan base being unhappy with their music. It seems like out of everyone I know, Im the only one dissatisfied with the last year and a half of BTS music.

Am I really the only one?",92,1,False,self,,,,,

I think it's different though, so hear me out! I saw some Christmas gift guides here for ARMYs but a lot of them were focused on buying things online and things that state-side folks have access to. I actually live here in Korea and I have a friend who is an ARMY (we are both ahgase). I want to get her BTS stuff from Korea, specifically things that she can't get in the states. I'm not an ARMY myself so I don't know about the little things they promote, maybe even like things they wear like sweaters or hats or jewelry. Could you recommend some items that you would want if I were offering to buy you anything here in Korea? I am already planning on getting her some skin care and cosmetics. Hopefully someone can suggest some clothes or accessories, and maybe something like fan merch. 

Also, I have heard of BT21 but I'm not sure what exactly is like actually BTS related. Is it all BTS related? Are there some things that you would like more, or like, is some stuff related to each member specifically? Her bias is Jungkook.

I really appreciate your help.

There were also three song festivals.  

Two more award shows might well be added into their calendars in the coming weeks. 

Just thinking about all this makes me tired. Does this seem a little excessive to you?  

Why is BTS doing every single one of them?  Is this the price they must pay for having an insanely successful year and having an entertainment company that, at present, does not have any feuds with any of the event organizers?   Is this likely to happen again next year?

I moved to a much smaller place this fall for my new job (which is why I haven't been so active on this sub) and while I love supporting BTS by buying physical albums, they take up a lot of space - which does not spark joy for me  :(  

Ideally I'd like to sell the albums in sets. None of the albums have photocards. Price is somewhat negotiable. 

*Love Yourself*  '*Her*' - $55 for 4 albums (would retail for $80) 

*Love Yourself  'Tear'* \- $60 for 4 albums (would retail for \~$85) 

*Love Yourself*   *'Answer'* \- $60 for 4 albums (would retail for \~$85) 

I usually sell on eBay because it makes shipping much easier, so if you're interested, let me know and I will make a listing for you to purchase it!

What are your first impressions of kpop fandoms in general, and if you're from an anything-western fandom (not sure how to call it) what are the similarities and differences you noticed? And how does it affect your involvement as an ARMY within the fandom? Do you think you would be willing to explore other artists or korean music, or just stay as an ARMY exclusively?

Most of the radio at my job is stuff that was in the top 40 3-4 years ago with some occasional Ariana or Taylor thrown in.  So imagine my surprise when I was in the back today working on inventory and I hears the first few bars of ""Idol""!! I literally froze and stared up at the speaker on the ceiling (as if it was going to magically tell me the name of the song) and then a few seconds later, when I heard RM start crooning, I FREAKED out and started texting my daughter (Yes, I am older ARMY!). It was over all too quickly and back to horrible music, but it made me wonder: How often is BTS on the radio and is it more often in different parts of the country/world?

Last summer my daughter and I were driving home from somewhere and sitting at a red light when ""Fake Love"" came on. We both started screaming and I remarked later that it was a good thing I wasn't driving at the time, or there may have been an accident. Those are the only two times it has come on any radio here where I live.

If you read through the thread, you will see that their hair color change at the Melon Music Awards last month is significant, as well as V's mask design at MAMA and the recent Fake Love performance at Golden Disc Awards this past weekend. (The excerpt of the theory is towards the end of the book, for those who have read it.) 

I read *Demian* a few weeks ago (I've literally been a fan for two months....) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I knew I mid-read I was going to reread it, though after reading this new theory, I might reread it sooner than expected. I need to continue this Bangtan Book Club journey to understand BTS' entire music storyline concept and *catch up to whatever is going on right now*!!! 

Honestly, I have never been so involved in a group who have such intelligent minds and reads such high-level subject books (psychology for the most part??) that tie into their music while making your brain explode. It makes me question how the hell I fell into this. [As Penny Pingleton would say...](https://media.giphy.com/media/4DAwmB7ptI45G/giphy.gif)

Mattel Inc., maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels toys, is turning to a Korean boy band for help luring the new generation of kids.

Mattel will create a toy line inspired by the  seven-member pop group BTS that includes dolls, collectible figures and  games, the El Segundo, California-based company announced at the Hong  Kong Toys &amp; Games Fair this week.

BTS, whose name is drawn from Bangtan Sonyeondan or  Beyond the Scene, is one of the best-selling music acts in the world.  Last year, BTS became the first Korean pop group to top the Billboard  album charts in the U.S., and sold out a concert at New York Citys Citi  Field.

**Thanks to a loyal fan base known as the #Army, the  groups economic value is estimated at more than 4 trillion won ($3.6  billion), according to the Hyundai Research Institute. Asian retailers  reported double-digit increases in customers for books and albums around  the release of the groups Love Yourself: Tear.**

**Some large companies are beginning to see commercial potential for  BTS  and the growing power of Korean pop culture more broadly. Carmaker  Hyundai Motor Co., messaging app Line and the sneaker brand Converse  are all working on new products with BTS.**

Shares in Mattel **climbed 7.7 percent Monday, after gaining 12 percent Friday** before the deal was announced.

Mattel could use the lift. Its stock fell 35 percent  last year after slumping 44 percent in 2017. One of two leading  toymakers in the U.S., the company hired a new chief executive officer  last year and is attempting to become a broader entertainment company  that turns its best-selling toys into TV shows and movies.",28,1,False,self,,,,,

Maybe something beautiful and interesting you heard on a later listen or just one you'd like to hype up but never get the chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My personal pick is **Hip Hop Phile** (which got slandered in the Bottom 5 Songs lists) (which is actually one of my favorite threads don't get it twisted) but I am a a hip hop fan outside Kpop and knowing that there is a song which celebrates like.... some amazing and revolutionary hip hop artists while tying rapline directly to that legacy. Saying ""these are the greats and we are far below them but we are striving to be a part of that same tradition and culture and live up to the legacy that those artists have set"" I think it's pretty noteworthy how little braggadocio the track contains. It's not a track about rap-line's skill, it's a track about the skills they hope to reach one day. 

Suga's line that 

&gt;""Everyone asks me, what is hip hop? / Then I confidently answer, my everything / As a result, my life has buried itself into music / If loving this culture is a sin / Ill die over a hundred times"" 

Although the boys have had more than a few run ins and issues balancing their respect for the culture with their geographical and cultural distance from it I think this song is a really amazing exploration into why hiphop means so much to each of rapline individually. It's definitely my favorite track off of Dark &amp; Wild. (and it makes me miss hiphop bangtan everyday) ",91,1,False,self,,,,,

i'd prefer to swap sizes in person as opposed to through the mail, which is why i'm looking to see if anyone in the nyc area would want to meet up and swap, but if anyone in the states would like to swap via mail pm me! i can provide photos of the merch and also proof that i'm not a serial killer to anyone interested.

Im an American myself, albeit young (roughly 2 decades), and radio is at best, an afterthought for me.  I find most of my music from recommended lists of streaming apps, or suggestions from friends.  I wouldnt know whats popular on the radio for a million dollars.

Speaking from a business perspective, how important is it that BTS gets radio spins?  How much more would they make getting them (considering also the benefits in the aftermath)?

Is radio tied closely to streaming?

Im a bit ignorant of the radio scene, but considering how amazing a year BTS had in many other respects (album sales, concerts, etc.), Im curious to know how and if radio play is important for them.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

One of the first few songs I played was Sea and I didnt realize that the dialogue exchange during Yoongis part was between the rap line, and they utilized the left side and right side of the earphones, kinda like they were whispering to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jungkook**

\- *Dope*  
He looked so fine with that hair and lip gloss I would let him arrest me anyday. The clothes fit him so nicely and made him look very buff and grown up to me.

\- *War of Hormone*  
That goddamned ripped cardigan. So cute

&amp;#x200B;

**Taehyung**

\- *DNA*  
Where do I even begin. HIS HAIR, that loose tie and contacts good lord

\- *Fake Love*  
His mullet is everything and the whatever it is on his outfit in MV (bondages) SIGN ME UP RN

&amp;#x200B;

**Jimin**

\- *War of Hormone*  
THat ass and he's just so adorable

&amp;#x200B;

**Namjoon**

\- *Spring Day*

By far. Grape Joon &gt;&gt;&gt;. He's so handsome in this era

&amp;#x200B;

**Hoseok**

**-** *Blood sweat and tears*  
The choker, deep V line shirt, his beautiful tangerine hair. Slayed

(special mentions to no more dream when his forehead was out)

&amp;#x200B;

**Yoongi**

\- *Run*  
Not even a question and I'm pretty sure majority of the fandom agree. Mint Yoongi is superior. In this era Yoongi was bad ass but also extremely cute at the same time

&amp;#x200B;

**Seokjin** (my bias uwu)

\- DNA  
He slays black hair and looks so grown up and dominant in this era. I also love the little parting in his hair that exposes some of his forehead. 

# - SAVE ME

Save Me Jin made my ovaries implode. Blonde, all black outfit fuck boy Jin my absolute favourite. I want him to stomp on my face spit at me and then push me off a cliff. He looks so amazing. His eyebrows. The ripped jeans. I LOVE HIM. If you dont stan Save Me Jin what are you even doing.",44,1,False,self,,,,,

So I decided to rip apart my room and renovate it from the ground up to fit the theme. This involved painting my bed, bookshelf, and desk (all jet black), as well as all the walls of my room (in Behr's colour ""Aspiring Blue"", which I felt complimented all of the photos and was as close as I could get to the colour of Jungkook's shirt. It's a kind of lovely teal colour). The other colour I tried to accent with was pale pink, which I used for some artificial flowers, vases and a desk lamp.

The number of Hallyu (or [Korean Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Wave)) fans surged to 89.19 million worldwide in 2018, according to a [year-end report](http://ebook.kf.or.kr/) by the government-affiliated Korea Foundation.

The non-profit organization, which promotes [a better understanding of Korea](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_service/lawView.do?lang=ENG&amp;hseq=18330),  reported that the 2018 Hallyu fan estimate is a 22 percent, or 16.07  million, increase from 73.12 million in 2017. Hallyu doesn't only  comprise K-pop  it also includes film, TV and language.

From 2016 to 2017, the report noted that Hallyu fans swelled by 14  million across the globe. Taken as a whole, theres been an increase of  30 million fans since 2016. Hallyus global fandom has grown  exponentially in only three years. So, the foundation predicted that the  Korean Wave will reach 100 million fans by 2020.

**This drastic increase in the global fandom was largely attributed to  the worlds biggest boy band, BTS. The septet has nearly 18 million  followers on Twitter, and they had the** [**most-liked tweet worldwide**](https://twitter.com/TwitterKorea/status/1070420413446991872) **last year.**

Not only did two of their albums reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200, but they sold the [second-highest amount of albums among all artists in the States](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinkelley/2019/01/06/bts-made-huge-gains-in-america-with-second-highest-album-sales-in-2018/#4e73e89b5ec2). Earlier in 2018, they were recognized with the [Order of Cultural Merit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinkelley/2018/10/27/bts-order-of-cultural-merit/#121c4da6e2d9) for spreading Korean culture.

President Moon Jae-in recently mentioned BTS in a speech that covered  his goals for the new year. Many foreigners are wildly excited about  K-pop such as BTS and Korean dramas, he said, according to [*Soompi*](https://www.soompi.com/article/1290401wpp/south-korean-president-moon-jae-mentions-bts-new-year-speech).  I will work to establish an environment of fair competition where the  creation of the second generation of BTS and the third generation of  Hallyu is possible, and creators receive the proper treatment they  deserve.

The foundations report also estimated that 1,843 Hallyu fan clubs  were spread across 113 countries, excluding South Korea, according to [*Yonhap News*](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190110012200325).  Hallyu fan clubs include enthusiasts of Korean singers, actors,  culture and food, taekwondo clubs and Korean culture societies at  universities.

The report also broke up fan estimates by region. North and South  America accounted for 11.8 million members at 712 fan clubs. Asia and  Oceania came out on top with 70.59 million members across 457 fan clubs.  Europe had 6.57 million members at 534 fan clubs, while Africa and the  Middle East had 230,000 members at 140 clubs.

Japan, the worlds second-biggest music market, has become a go-to  promotional region for K-pop over the years. But 2018 was Hallyus most  successful year in the country as the number of fans tripled to over 300,000. Steady growth was also attributed to other parts of Asia,  Africa and the Middle East.

**The Korea Foundation also noted the** [**purchasing power of female fans**](https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2018/8491604/girl-crush-k-pop-feminism-2018)**, who became the key consumers of cosmetics, tourism and other fields.**",23,1,False,self,,,,,

True, BigHit has other artists (albeit solo or duos), but I never thought there would be another boy group so soon. BTS were newbies in mid 2013. Let that sink in. It's only been 5 years since debut, and the list of accomplishments is hard to keep track of. The start of TXT makes me think that there will be changes with BTS, potentially military enlistment, or a spin-off unit. I don't envy TXT. They are starting from such a good place compared to their seniors but that also comes with the pressure to excel. I hope they do well in their own right. I also look forward to TXT x BTS content :D mostly because it will be so entertaining seeing BTS in a big brother role. Finally, I hope that with a new group, some of the pressure will be taken off BTS and they get more time to spend with friends and family. ",171,1,False,self,,,,,

Some Personal Experiences

* On day 1 of the Love Yourself Tour in Newark, I was waiting at a crosswalk near the Prudential Center with a group of what looked like businesspeople in their 40s-50s. I overheard a woman in that group asking what was going on at Prudential and a man told her ""It's a group from South Korea, BTS."" He even mentioned how they were on GMA and Jimmy Fallon a few days prior and at the UN General Assembly before that! It was my first time hearing people from the general public IN PERSON discussing BTS's achievements.
* In one of my giant lectures, my professor was discussing globalization and she brought up ""cultural globalization"" as a ""soft power"". Then she asked us why BTS was so popular outside of their own country! Another day, she brought up the traditional Korean song ""Arirang"" and played a bunch of renditions of the song. Lo and behold, BTS's Arirang was there and I could hear the ARMYs in the room trying to contain themselves when it was playing
* Someone at my university posted a bunch of BTS posters promoting LY:Answer around the busiest places on campus (I wish I knew who did it ;-;)
* BTS is already known to make appearances on Times Square billboards, but I didn't know there was a giant LG billboard! Watching those BTS ads made my 30 minutes trying to get out of the sea of people (this was a few days before NYE, it was crowded as hell) somewhat bearable.",49,1,False,self,,,,,

I recently came across Bangtan's [first appearance on After School Club] (https://youtu.be/LDnQMskuVqM) and realised I have only seen short clips from it and never watched the full episode. They are extra adorable in this and I wanted to share it with you guys.

So I thought it would be fun for us to share our favorite interviews, appearances on shows or behind the scenes of music shows, etc. *Especially the more obscure ones which people might not have come across*

My favorite is [Show champion backstage Run era] (https://youtu.be/NgbTb_13NhA). You might have seen clips from this but the whole thing is worth watching because they are so exhausted and are just saying whatever xD

I also thought this would be helpful for the newer fans who have joined this sub over the past few months. So please feel free to share them below. ",42,1,False,self,,,,,

I currently have 2 options:

1. my suede ankle boots
-8.5cm heel+1.5cm platform=7cm elevation, adds 8.5cm to my height
-SUEDE (might get stained)
-pros: I'd be 8.5cm taller, which definitely helps when I'm 153cm with a standing ticket
-stylish
-comfortable ish
-not easy to trip or twist ankle because of broad base
-wearing heels of similar height for internship and formal events has trained me a littLe

2. my merrell hiking boots
-my day to day shoe
-sturdy as hell
-no elevation tho
-comfortable as hell
-good arch support

my ticket info:
-standing
-red category
-queue number: &lt;15 (yes fifteen, but I'm stilL ultra worried my queue would get cut and I would end up blocked)

what do y'all think? take my suede or the hiking boots? 

or both just in case I can't handle the suede?

help please. this is a legit dilemma for me because as much as I don't want to sacrifice comfort, I also don't want my view of the concert to be blocked by someone else, a concert where I blew A LOT OF money on :(( bc I'm someone who usually don't splurge on artists I follow

Idk if that makes sense but for example RM changed from trying to seen (/taken seriously maybe?) as a stereotypical rapper to just being comfortable with himself and being the rapper he wants to be which changed the fandoms reaction to his most recent rap album to (from what Ive seen) people really not wanting to let it flop like I guess it had before? (Not sure 100% kuz I havent been here since the beginning ya know but everyone on Twitter kept saying dont let this flop as if it had before)

If anyone could give me more in-depth explanation as to what this venture entails for BigHit in general, I'd be grateful. Were there any articles written on the matter? 

Their focus is clearly the global market. Is that ""global"" as in Asia, or is BigHit and CJM (or well, ""Belif+"") planning to target the US/western market with another group in the future, in an attempt to ""replicate"" BTS' success? Most likely not while BTS are still going strong and have barely reached their peak, but rather planting a seed for the future.

My 2 cents: I'm very skeptical. I see BTS as a once in a lifetime phenomenon. Sure, other groups have made strides to inch their way up BB200 and the Hot100, but they don't come close to what BTS have in the western market, and that's a fact. On top of that, their mega success is due to so many unique factors aligning perfectly, from the timing of their debut to BigHit's artistic vision to the self-produced music to the members' personalities and addictive dynamics, as well as a fandom so massive and dedicated no one's seen anything like it in the internet age.

So, if this new company's goal is to prepare for another ""global group"" at the level of BTS and beyond, do you think that's even feasible? Is that even realistic? What are your thoughts?",11,1,False,self,,,,,

Personally:

JK- Something meaty- chicken tandoori, korma, vindaloo, butter chicken, etc. I'm a vegan but I would still want him to try my native cuisine with gusto- and he loves meat! Also, naan. Lots of naan. He needs the flour.

NJ- Hakka Noodles! The boy loves his ! So why not another noodle dish?

Suga- He loves expensive, luxurious food- so a meaty, expensive dish with saffron- perhaps murgh mutton?

Jin- He seems to be the most passionate about food out of all of them, and loves seafood- let's say, Goan fish curry, and some meat tandoori skewers.

Jimin- Biryani. He seems to really love his rice.

Hobi- Loves his sweets! Jalebi, gulab- jamun, rasmalai, semiya kheer, etc.

Tae- Loves ice-cream- so, kulfi. And aloo gobi.

As a science major, this debate reminded me a lot about the very classic Nature versus Nurture debate. Do a persons characteristics, personality, drive, etc determine their overall behavior and future (Nature) or does the environment they grow up in and the opportunities they receive ultimately shape behavior and their future path (Nurture)? It is really interesting to see this exact debate apply with BTS and TXT, ironically enough (Pied Piper who?). I have seen some attribute BTS and their success to Big Hits encouraging and free-will management style, while others argue that the members, their talent, and their passion/love for music led them to success. Folks who agree with the former seem excited to stan the new group because of Big Hits positive track-record and outstanding progress they have had with BTS. Those who agree with the latter seem to be of two mindsets: stanning TXT if their music is good or causal listener/non-stan with support but have BTS as their priority. What are your thoughts on what makes a group successful: nature or nuture? Has this influenced your outlook on the new group?


Disclaimer: There really is no right or wrong answer. There is still no agreement to this day about nature vs. nurture among scientists, so this simply for friendly discussion.

Hello, everyone! I'm here today to look for people to meet up with for the LY Your movie. I'm in Ontario, Canada (dm for city info of you're interested), and I'm looking for other ARMYs to go with. 

My main idea was to get around 5 people and to give out small presents for other ARMYs who are waiting in line. I heard that people do that on concerts?

So, yeah, that's it for my post here. I would very much enjoy meeting up with other people and making new friends. Also, my mom told me that it is sad for people to go by themselves to the movies, so I needed some new friends anyway, and if the presents don't work out, it is fine by me, I'm ok with having your company :)",10,1,False,self,,,,,

This is what I came up with:

RM: struggles and learnings from being a leader /  his journey to accepting his faults and learning to ""love himself"" / choosing a career away from the traditional route /  thoughts on what defines hip hop / philosophy / life in general. Write me a book Kim Namjoon!!!

Jin: a book about dealing with insecurities, building self-confidence and loving yourself. A book about how his dreams have evolved since joining BTS. Also something about his life philosophy / going with the flow. A book on how to use laughter to spread joy, make others comfortable. 

Suga: a book where he talks about his passion for producing and breaks down his favourite BTS songs, his thoughts on what defines kpop and hiphop, his thoughts on what made BTS popular and frank thoughts on how they were initially treated. A book on his journey / his initial struggles in Seoul. But also this book: an ode to sleep. Followed by its sequel; why i want to be a rock in my next life.

J-hope: a book where he breaks down BTS choreography, talks about the hidden meanings but also provides snippets of things that happened whilst they were learning these dances. Also  book on his journey, reflecting on leaving BTS predebut / his life philosophy / why its important for him to be ""hope"" to his fans

Jimin: a book on his struggle and journey with insecurities / striving for perfection. A book with his polaroids and mini stories about the members around them. A book entitled: how to be a maknae when the maknae isnt doing it right

V: artsy photo book #vante / a book about being individual, not being afraid to stand out / a book about his struggles as an artist (e.g. being an initial hidden member. Also how to raise the perfect dog (complete with photos)

Jungkook: a book describing all he's learned from each hyung and how he thinks they influenced him / a book with his photos and also one describing his journey with video. A book full of his many, many dreams and ambitions for the future. A book called: 1001 ways to steal your hyungs food when they're not looking (or even when they are)

What would yours be?

Note 1: i'm not saying the members would ever write these books. This is just a little fun on what I would like to read if I could wave a wand and have books written by them :)

Note 2: i realised writing this that for a lot of the members, similar themes about self-acceptance were coming out, tying in with the ""love yourself ideas"". For me, i think this reiterates how sincere they are in their music and speeches/interviews/v-lives etc. So that the same ideas carry through everything they do. It also made me realise how loving yourself is so personal, because I would want every member to cover this and believe that if they did they would all write about it differently, based on personal experience.

I personally consider their changes a positive thing because they all seem much more welcome in their own skin nowadays and more comfortable(?) with expressing themselves,especially Namjoon , Jin and Jimin. And of course the others as well. I am of the impression that of course they have matured but they are still the same people and they have found themselves and what fits them,have started exploring the things that interest them and are more comfortable with who they are and with each other.At least,in my eyes.And I love that they seem happier because if it.

My question is this: Why are there frequent disagreements among Army about whether to express our concerns to the boys about their health and well-being and, if so, how?  This most often comes up when discussing sleep and rest, but I think it also sometimes happens when talking about what they eat or the physical risks they take in their choreography. 

My hope is that, by trying to understand why these differences occur, we might be more tolerant and compassionate with our fellow ARMYs when we discuss this stuff.  

I have lots of theories about why this happens, but I'll just share one. I hope I can articulate it properly.  

The boys often say that they do everything for the benefit and glory of ARMY.  That's a big part of their communication strategy.  Since they are so transparent about everything they do, we see them suffering sometimes. We see them in pain.  We see them exhausted and tired. Given this, I think it's normal for some fans to say ""Look... you say you do all these things for our benefit. But we see you struggling sometimes.  Please know that we don't want you to struggle so much just to fulfil our needs.  Your health is more important to us than trophies.""  

But, to use an analogy, I think it's possible for other fans -- perhaps those who are more familiar with the kpop world? -- to view the boys in a manner similar to professional athletes.  Even though athletes get injured, get tired, and struggle a lot, I have never, ever heard a sports fan say ""Oh.  Poor dear.  He should work less and rest more so that he doesn't suffer so much.""   Sports fans see a certain amount of suffering and struggle as an inherent part of the job.  In a similar manner, I am guessing that some kpop fans see fatigue, injury and struggle as an inherent part of the job of kpop.  In the perspective of these folks, encouraging the boys to slow down would be absurd. 

I don't think either perspective is wrong.  I believe (with no basis, I admit) that the boys would view concerns about their sleep and rest -- even fervently-phrased ones -- as genuine expressions of caring from their fans.  But I also suspect that they'll continue to work hard, like all kpop artists do. They aren't going to slow down solely because so many of us want them to. 

TL;DR  Some disagreements may arise because of different perceptions of a) the nature of the relationship between BTS and ARMY and b) the nature of a kpop artist's job.

*Billboard* canexclusively share that*BTS World Tour Love Yourself in Seoul*will  be available in ScreenXformat on Jan.26,for a two-week run. In  addition to the previously announcedone-day screening in traditional2D  movieformat, fans have up to two more weeks to experience BTS'*Love Yourself*  show viaScreenX's uniquely immersive showingthat includes a  270-degree, panoramicviewing experienceutilizing both the center and  side walls of movie theaters.

""We are very excited to be bringing the new theater concert experience *BTS World Tour Love Yourself in Seoul*  to ScreenX,"" said JongRyul Kim, CEO of CJ 4DPLEX, the Seoul-based  cinema technology company that created ScreenX and other immersive film  experiences. ""This film brings music fans around the world one step  closer to experiencing a private concert experience.""

Previous to*Love Yourself in Seoul*, fellow K-pop act [TWICE](https://www.billboard.com/music/twice) brought their*Twiceland*concert movie to ScreenXtheaters in December 2018.*Billboard*  noted in a review that ""delivering K-pop concerts and performances via  ScreenX theaters makes sense as the groups tend to have a higher number  of bandmembers and can feature more consistent closeups.""

Fans around the world should look out for *Love Yourself in Seoul*to  be available for viewing in both the traditional and  ScreenX-equippedtheaters in the previouslyannounced 95 countries and  territories, with the ScreenXviewing schedule to run up to two weeks in  most of the territories.

It's been about a week into the new year already and we wish you guys the best on your resolutions. As difficult as it may seem right now, don't quit! You can do it!

2018 ended with a packed schedule, so for this reason we weren't able to fit the V + JIN birthday projects before the year ended. While we know it's late for birthday letters, we still wanted to provide you guys the opportunity to send the boys a compilation of fan messages and fan art. Since their birthdays have passed, your submissions can be about anything as long as they are appropriate and follow the guidelines of submission. The themes we provided are optional, but use them as a prompt if you'd like to do so :) Okay, now what are the birthday projects? 

&gt; The birthday projects are a collection of fan messages and fan art created by our subreddit, that is sent to the boys as a small way to show our support and love for them. We used to print these compilations as books, but since Big Hit now only accepts fan letters, we now print these as small pamphlets so they can still fit in an envelope and be mailed. ^Ha! Paired with each project is a charity that we donate to as our 'birthday gift' for the members. To date, our community has raised over $2,002.43 USD for various charities, including the Love Myself campaign. See [all previous projects here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects#wiki_eng).



Yup, that's basically it! So without further ado, here are our December birthday projects:



**V's Birthday Project theme: Singularity**

When did you know you were in the fandom to stay? How was your journey down the BTS rabbit hole.

**Jin's Birthday Project theme: Epiphany**

How did BTS help you love yourself? Or, how does Jin's confidence help you love yourself?

&amp;nbsp;

**GUIDELINES **

&gt; - The **theme is optional**; you can still send in normal letters and photos/art.
&gt;
&gt; - Only the message and credit fields are required. **After clicking 'Submit', please wait for the confirmation screen to appear to ensure that your submission is properly saved.**



**MESSAGE SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - You are allowed **1 message**.
&gt;
&gt; - Please limit your message to **500 characters** (about 80 words, or a really small paragraph).
&gt;
&gt; - **No inappropriate messages**. If it doesn't follow the subreddit rules, we WILL remove it.



**FAN ART / PHOTO SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - Please include **self created** artworks and photographs only.
&gt;
&gt; - We recommend that the files should have a resolution of **at least 300 dpi**. This goes for photos, and digital or scanned fan art.
&gt;
&gt; - You are allowed **1 photo per submission**. Please, no photo collages. We want your photos to print clearly and beautifully so the boys can appreciate them.



The BTS Projects Team has made a custom Google Script for your submissions. In order to access the submission forms, click 'Trust App'. We promise we did not code anything malicious.

# CHARITY

- For both projects, we will be donating to the BTS and UNICEF [Love Myself campaign](http://www.unicef.or.kr/donation/en/index.asp). You may opt to donate through [the BTS Projects Team's PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Don't forget to specify how we should credit you in the comment section of the transaction.

- If you would prefer to donate directly to the Love Myself campaign, but would like your donation to count under our subreddit's running total, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYzsA-58zbKmBm1B8B7sdyM1adGfRjq3jBvNf1OMXnvzr_VA/viewform?usp=sf_link) after donating. We will include you in the project credits as well.

- Accompanying the monetary donation to the Love Myself campaign, we have decided to add [freerice](http://freerice.com/about) to the charity portion of the birthday projects. With the freerice option, basically, you donate a few minutes of your time instead of money; you'll be asked some trivia questions and for each one you get right, freerice will donate some rice. Simple. If you joined us for this year's first annual MustServe, you are ready to participate! If this is your first time joining us, PM us so we can help you get set up with the rest of the r/bangtan freerice group.



# EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **MESSAGE SUBMISSIONS will close at 30TH JAN, 11:59PM CST / 31ST JAN, 1:59PM KST**. You can use this [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to find out the exact date and time submissions close for you.

- **We will be accepting charity donations until 3RD FEB, 11:59 KST**. Printing and shipping costs will be shouldered by the coordinators, but we will appreciate extra funds to cover these two projects. So, if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping, you can send it to us through [the team's PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs).

- We want to be responsible with your money, and allocate it to the appropriate project, so please don't forget to specify the amount, e.g. ""$5 for charity and $5 for printing and shipping"" in the notes. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations. Also, if any money set aside for covering printing and shipping costs remain after the book has been ordered, we will put the remaining balance towards the charity donation.

* You can find the survivor rounds by **searching this sub for ""survivor""**.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

* The top 3 songs from each era championship series will be entered into an **ultimate championship series**.

Since I'm based in Europe, I'd prefer to sell it to someone in Europe but I'd be willing to ship anywhere when we agreed on the shipping costs. Payment would be prefered over Paypal's friends&amp;family option and I'd send with tracking.

I ordered it online because I was scared they'd sell out at the concert. When I was there I was able to buy one though so this came as a double and was never unpackaged.

BTS is putting their ultra-successful merchandising strategy into overdrive.

LG announced the Q7+ BTS Edition ([Q617QA](https://www.lg.com/us/cell-phones/lg-Q617QA-q7-plus-bts)) last September for South Korea, but its [finally making its way to the United States](https://www.lg.com/us/cell-phones/lg-Q617QA-q7-plus-bts). The device is up for pre-order on [Amazon for $379.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KL3MNYV/) and ships within the next few months.

The Q7+ BTS Edition is only compatible with carriers AT&amp;T and  T-Mobile. And yes, fans will actually switch carriers just to have this  phone in their hands.

The Q7+ BTS is designed to appeal to the BTS ARMY, the groups die-hard fanbase.

Basically, these guys buy everything, including a $380 phone with a bunch of BTS stuff pre-loaded onto it.

**The Q7+ BTS includes a handful of special BTS wallpapers and themes  that can be set to rotate daily or hourly. The phone ships with themes  that are unique to each of the seven members, but must be downloaded  from LG Smartworld.**

**Fans can choose to be woken up by their favorite member of the band with BTS Wake-Up and Goodnight calls.**

**A member of the band will call you at the designated time as the  alarm. The Q7+ BTS Edition also features exclusive BTS emoji to send to  friends.**

**Also included are some BTS voice ringtones in English. Finally, the  phone features a Connect to BTS folder that links to the bands social  media accounts and website.** 

The BTS logo features prominently on the back of the phone, the charger, and earbuds included with the device.

As far as specs go, the LG Q7+ BTS Edition has a 5.5-inch screen  powered by a Snapdragon 450 processor. The device features 64GB of  onboard storage and aluminum construction. **The front camera also  includes BTS stickers to allow the user to take pictures with their  favorite BTS member.**

Weve seen fan edition phones released before, so the idea of  promotion is nothing new. But this one is tightly tailored to K-pop  fans. Its available for $380 in just a few weeks, and were expecting a  very quick sellout once ARMY fans in the United States can grab it.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I don't want to dampen someone else's experience. So I was wondering, what are your expectations? Anything you're particularly looking forward to?

My name is Oda Tolsrod, and I am doing my undergraduate degree in Publishing Media at Oxford Brookes University, and I am currently writing my dissertation.

I am writing my dissertation on BTS and the publishing industry, more specifically looking into how publishing can benefit from subcultures who emerge into mainstream media due to digital and social media. 

To get primary information, I have decided to do a questionnaire. 

This is where you come in! Would you please be willing to answer my questionnaire? It will take about 5-10 minutes, and the results will be invaluable for my research.

The only criteria are that you're an ARMY and that you are over 16 years old (this is to adhere to ethics guidelines).

Namjoon and Yoongi had years of rap beforehand and even still Hobi worked really hard to keep up. I feel his breakout song was ""one verse"". At that point I felt he really was confident and found his identity as a rapper. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Cypher pt 4 I felt Hobi had the second best rap behind Yoongi and that really speaks to Hobi because Namjoon is a really good rapper himself. In Mic drop I don't think the song could work as well it could if it didn't have Hobi's rap entrance to set the tone of the song.

I feel really bad when I read it, because there are very toxic people in this fandom who would go to great lengths of verbally abusing fansites (telling that person to kill themselves etc) when there are no concrete evidence about them being sasaeng and even more when the BTS member himself is allegedly aware/supportive of the fansite's innocence. Surprisingly there are even YouTube channels that made clickbait videos about these occurrences even when those fansites are not included in the official blacklist of BigHit such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/afwph9/190114_bighit_blacklistings_which_includes/).  


I understand that as ARMY we want the boys to feel safe and protected at all times and want to discourage these sasaeng behaviour by publicly calling them out, but abusing them on a personal level is not the types of behaviour that BTS would condone of this fandom. I write this post because I personally was made believed of the accusations I read online about certain fansites that are alleged to be sasaeng, but when I research more it turned out they are not. What made me even more disappointed was the heavy backlash/torment they received even after they have apologized for being wrong in the past and didn't repeat the mistake.  


I watched a video about very frightening behaviour about sasaengs in South Korea where it seems to be a very organised [underground activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QEDhh89ZLs), but I think with BTS nowadays more often travelling in private jets than not, and staying in a very well guarded apartment area to protect their privacy, I feel we can be rest assured that Big Hit are very aware of the boys safety and doing the best they can to protect them. Therefore, ARMY can relax and trust that only the released blacklist information are the official sasaengs. I just want to open a discussion here, whereby 1) we should try to reduce down the negativity/perception with regard to this fandom being too protective/toxic (to the point of being abusive to others) and 2) create more awareness that some accusations that float around online are incorrect and should be treated as such.

BTS is being quiet for once so it's time to (finally) swoop in with **the /r/bangtan Awards 2018**! This post is to bring you some more details about the awards, as well as give you a short heads-up before opening the first round.

You can see the previous announcement explaining the awards and introducing the categories [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/a8qma5/rbangtan_awards_2018_coming_soon/). Tl;dr  best stuff of 2018 to leave in history for the next generation.

*****

#When will this happen?

The first round will open in a couple of days on **January 22nd** at about **11PM KST | 6AM PST | 2PM UTC**. Voting will be up for about a week. (The date of the second round will depend on how quickly I can whip it up, but I'll try to be fast.)

#How does it work?

The awards will function the same way as last year. There will be **two rounds of voting:**

* The first round will be used to determine the **top 5 candidates** from each category. This happens in designated reddit threads (on a separate subreddit for the event, no worries about clutter!).
* The top 5 nominees enter the final rounds. This happens in a meticulously hand-crafted probably beautiful Google Form.
* If there are less than 5 nominees in a category, the winner will be determined on the first round and that category won't have a final round.

#What are the rules for the nominations?

1. You may vote for as many nominations as you wish, and you can start voting right away (as soon as nominations appear).
2. **Don't reply to any nominations within the voting threads.** Any replies will be removed to keep it neat.
3. Please give **a link/source for any videos and gifs** you use in your nominations!
4. You can nominate as many things in as many categories as you wish, as long as they fall on the eligible time period and are relevant to the categories.
5. [Subreddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) still apply.

*****

All this information will be found in the actual voting thread as well, when it goes up. If you have any questions at this point, feel free to drop a comment (and check the categories [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/a8qma5/rbangtan_awards_2018_coming_soon/) if you wanna get those nominations ready)!",26,1,False,self,,,,,

Recently, after getting the influx of Notes and Webtoons from BTS, I have went back down the rabbit hole and kept rewatching old MVs, trying to figure out if I have missed anything. I felt very nostalgic after watching the Mic Drop video, as it was the first BTS MV that I watched. It reminded me of what my first thoughts and impressions of each member was, and it was really funny noticing how my opinion of the members have now changed so much. I thought it would be really interesting to find out from other ARMYs how their first vs current impressions of the members have changed (or remained the same) throughout the years.

Mic Drop Video (First Impressions)

RM: What is going on with this guy's hairstyle...

JIN: Left no impression on me (That I can remember)

SUGA: I like this guy, he looks good, dresses well and can rap.

HOBI: This guy can dance! I also like how he is dressed and looks good with the bucket hat on.

JIMIN: This guy dances really well as well, and I also like the way he is dressed and looks cool with the bucket hat.

V: I don't like this guy's face for some reason.

JK: Left no impression on me (That I can remember)

&amp;#x200B;

Current impressions and thoughts:

RM: The perfect definition of a leader, big brother and true friend. I truly admire his intelligence, the way he takes care of his members and his work ethic towards music as a whole. Joon truly is multi-talented when it comes to music, and his production and song writing skills truly make BTS music so special. I also really admire how his dance skills have improved over the years, and how he still holds the title of king of destruction lol. He has made some poor hair choices in the past lol, but ultimately has made up for it recently (Grey and Grape haired Joon, OMG).

JIN: WORLD WIDE HANDSOME! I really don't understand how I didn't notice Jin at first, he looks amazing in the Mic Drop video. One of the loudest BTS members with a gift for telling dad jokes and being cringey yet so cute at the same time. He is a true example of someone who has accepted himself for who he is, and is confident in himself. I really admire that about him and am trying to do the same.

SUGA: This guy is literally me. Suga is my ultimate bias, and everything I admire about him just keeps growing from day to day. No matter how lazy and sleepy he feels, when it comes to music, he is so passionate about it and has the most amazing work ethic. His rap skills amazed me at first, but his dance skills and vocal skills keep growing and I'm so proud of how much of effort he puts into everything. Although he can be quiet and withdrawn, his leadership skills are evident, and he is determined and driven, and has a crazy side as well. I love his cute lil meow meow personality, as well as when he goes into Agust D mode. His stage presence is phenomenal. I should probably stop now, and just say that I love and admire everything about. And I really wanna boop his adorable nose.

HOBI: SUNSHINE. I really admire the way Hobi always tries to keep everyone around him smiling, and his bubbly personality is just infectious, you literally can't not be happy when you're with J-Hope. His passion and skills in dancing are some of the best I have ever witnessed. The way he raps is so unique and I also enjoy listening to his vocal skills. I feel like Hobi is a very mysterious person though, like I can never figure out what goes on in his head.

JIMIN: King of duality!!! Bias-wrecker. My favourite vocalist in BTS, his voice absolutely mesmerizes me. Cute innocent little baby boy to Sexy AF in one sweep of his hair. I love Jimin's fluid dance movements, that are so different from the way Hobi and JK dance. His personality is so endearing, and the way he behaves with his members,  makes me just want to squish him. I'm really excited for more solo music from him.  

V: I am so sorry V, I can't believe I didn't like your face before, there must have been something wrong with me. V bias wrecks me soooo much, especially recently. I love his deep voice, his dance skills, his acting skills, and most definitely his face!!! Like Jimin, he can go from baby boy to Sexy AF in seconds. My favourite thing about V though, is his personality, he is just so sweet, cute and quirky, and he really makes me feel so happy whenever I watch videos of him.

JK: The Golden Maknae. I also do not understand how I didn't notice JK at first. JK is one of those rare individuals who is totally talented in everything he tries, and is always willing to try out new things, which is something I love, and really wish I could be more like that. It's weird to see how he has grown from a little baby into a grown man, and I feel so conflicted as to how I can find him attractive yet still feel protective over him at the same time. I am really hoping for him to drop his mixtape soon, and am hoping for rapper kook to make an appearance again.

Sorry for the very long and detailed descriptions, even those details cannot fully describe my love for all the unique features that each member possesses.

As announced in [December](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/a8qma5/rbangtan_awards_2018_coming_soon/) and again [a couple of days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/ahztb1/coming_very_soon_rbangtan_awards_2018/), I'm excited to tell you that it's now time for

#The /r/bangtan Awards 2018!

The first round of voting will be open for **a week, until January 29th approx. 11PM KST | 6AM PST | 2PM UTC**

The eligibility period for nominations is **January 1st, 2018 - December 31st, 2018.**

Please see the **description of categories inside each voting thread.**

*****

#How it works

The awards will function the same way as last year. There will be **two rounds of voting:**

* The first round will be used to determine the **top 5 candidates** from each category. This happens in designated reddit threads (on a separate subreddit for the event, no worries about clutter!).
* The top 5 nominees enter the final rounds. This happens in a meticulously hand-crafted probably beautiful Google Form.
* If there are less than 5 nominees in a category, the winner will be determined on the first round and that category won't have a final round.

#Rules

1. You may vote for as many nominations as you wish, and you can start voting right away (as soon as nominations appear). Keep checking back so you won't miss nominations that are added later on!
2. **Don't reply to any nominations within the voting threads.** Any replies will be removed to keep it neat. If you want to comment on the nominations, you can use this thread!
3. Please give **a link/source for any videos and gifs** you use in your nominations.
4. You can nominate as many things in as many categories as you wish, as long as they fall on the eligible time period and are relevant to the categories. Make sure it hasn't been nominated already.
5. [Subreddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) still apply.

I don't know if someone ever asked this before, but I was wondering:

if you could only hear two BTS songs for the rest of your life (you could hear any other song from any group, but only two from BTS), which songs would you choose? And why?

For me, it would be Sea and Run. 

Sea because it helps me think and put things in perspective, and it conveys a harsh truth: if there is hope, there is hardship. 

Run because it makes me strive to be better while it reminds me life is quite easier if you're having fun living it. 

And what about you? I would really like to hear your opinions!

My friends and I put together [a website](https://bangtanfor.life) last year, with an introduction to [BTS](https://bangtanfor.life/bts), [ARMYs](https://bangtanfor.life/army), and a [timeline of key events](https://bangtanfor.life/timeline) sorted per year since BTS debuted. We already shared [our site here on the sub a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/8syxf4), but since BTS has been *~~a bit~~* ~~quiet recently~~ ^(I typed this before the influx of posts from the members omg), [as promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9s0rm1/an_army_returns_from_the_jungle_after_8_months/e8l76mj), heres the updated timeline till 2019. I hope it's okay to share this here as a post so more people see it!  


# [https://bangtanfor.life/timeline](https://bangtanfor.life/timeline)

&amp;#x200B;

**Some notes about the timeline:**

* Arranged per year are events which includes MVs, album, mixtape, and song cover releases, award shows, milestones, and selected tweets.
* We only included highlights so as not to overload the timeline, but if we missed any, please feel free to comment below so we can add them in! 
* Please let us know if you find any error so we can have it fixed asap!
* The site will be updated by the end of each month ^(or as it happens lol)

Personally, when I fell into this rabbit hole around May 2017, I really wanted to *attempt* to catch up with all of the content I missed, especially watch the MVs in sequence as they were released! Hopefully our site can be useful to other ARMYs too.

Let us know what you think and how else we can improve the site! You can reach us here or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bangtanfor_Iife)!

""The use of lightsticks that can be remote-controlled made the view of the audience from the stage indescribably beautiful. Korean fans tend to be more dynamic/active than overseas fans. The sense of unitedness and perceived similarity among ARMY made it possible to spread such concert culture to overseas countries,"" said one of the selection committee members.

Though I am not the one planning and officially running the /r/bangtan awards this year (thanks /u/llaverna!), I still hold it near and dear to my heart. And I'm sad to see that participation is down somewhat compared to last year, when we had around 1/2 the subscribers we do now. What's up with that?  

but the most egregious, offensive thing in my opinion? 

#There are ONLY 5 nominations for meme of the year.

Really? There are ONLY 5 good memes in the WHOLE of 2018?  

Look, even if your most favorite-ist meme is already nominated, we like to announce the TOP 5 memes. So even if you're like ""man, there's no way this meme will come in 1st, or even 2nd or 3rd or 4th place!"" you should STILL submit it. Variety is the spice of life, even more so with these kinds of awards. We NEED choice! Submit even mediocre memes!  

The above is esp true with categories like ""performance of the year"". Like there were a lot of good ones, guys. There was more than just MMA's IDOL performance. We want to find the TOP 5 so give us 5!! 

Here are some other categories that, imo, are under-nominated compared to the bananas year BTS has had:  

* [Best BTS moment of 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/ai10eo/best_bts_moment_of_2018/) (There are only 4 nominations)  
* [Meme of the Year](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/ai0zqv/bts_meme_of_the_year_2018/) (Only 5)
* [GIF/Photo of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/ai108y/gifphoto_of_the_year_2018/) (There's only 5)  
* [Best non-official track/cover](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/ai0xvd/best_nonofficial_trackcover_of_2018/) (There's only 6)  
* [Most Savage Moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/ai0x4k/most_savage_moment_of_2018/) (There's only 6)  
* [BTS x ARMY Interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/ai0wrl/best_bts_x_army_interaction_2018/) (Only 7)  
* [Best BTS x Other Artist Interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtanawards/comments/ai0wy0/best_bts_x_other_artist_interaction_2018/) (Only 8)  

[Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/aim5xm/rbangtan_awards_2018_first_round_is_open/) for the full list of categories. All of them can always use more love!!

I was into a lot of groups, and while BTS wasn't my favorite, I enjoy their music still and they have great personalities which I admire. 

I'd also like to mention that I'm a swedish female and turn 20 in a few days, for context. Now for the story...

In october 2018 I started working at a factory of sorts and I'm currently working with shampoo and conditioner with like 5/6 other people in my group. Not the most exciting job for sure, but it pays the bills.

Now, I usually keep my earphones plugged in as it keeps me focused and to avoid having to talk to people as I'm very shy and anxious, but sometimes I like to just listen to the sounds around me and pull my earphones out for a few hours. From time to time, when I do this, I hear someone, somewhere blasting BTS. I had no idea where it came from or who it was. I looked around me for quite a bit but didn't see any signs of who it could be, so I moved on.

Like a month later I had to work in the hair color department which is next to the shampoo. As I got there, I found the two girls responsible. They were both in their 30's/40's and they a phone in between them which played their greatest hits on YouTube. Now, I should also mention that the factory I work at takes in a lot of people with special needs. I work there due to my ADHD and I have to see how many hours a day I can work with my diagnose. There are a lot of people working here with much worse problems than me; mental and physical.

After gathering some courage and thinking I could make some friends with these two women, I asked them ""Is that BTS?"" with a kind smile. Their faces lit up with joy. We talked for a bit about how we got into them and such. The older woman said that her daughter knew EVERYTHING there is to know about them and when she herself gave them a listen, she fell completely in love with them. 

I realized after some time that they were new ARMY's and decided to ask if they had heard my favorite song by them, Blanket Kick. They looked at me like I had 4 eyeballs, and then completely disregarded my question. This is when I started realizing that they were the ""bad kind"". I still wanted to keep some kind of conversation going though, so I asked them about Kpop in general (yet I don't really remember what they replied.) I asked about NCT (my favorite) and they replied (with a really sour attitude, might I add) ""Yeah, I've heard of them, but I just like BTS."" I knew at this point that they were bad news, so I backed off and listened to my own music.

A bit closer to the end of my shift, the older woman comes up to me again and she asks me, genuinely interested, who my bias is. I told her ""J-Hope"". Imagine the confusion on my face when she just yelled ""F\*CK"" right in my face and stormed off.

I still don't know what happened, or if I said something wrong (?), but I see them from time to time. They've clearly really bonded over their love for the group and are still playing their music quite often. They ignore me though. Must have hit some kind of nerve, lol.

I have decided to post this with the ""discussion"" flair, as I don't know where else to post this, but I needed to get it off my chest. And sorry if this is messy - it took so long for me to write this out due to my focus being basically non-existent.",17,1,False,self,,,,,

I love BTS and this community so much. New fans are discovering BTS every day and I wanted to somehow contribute to this community. There are a lot of introduction videos for BTS on YouTube but the ones I've watched either don't include narration, use Microsoft Sam or some other variant, and/or spends too much time on BTS memes.

So I created my own video that I hope is more personable, helpful, and somewhat comprehensive. It took a lot of time to create, more so than I expected but I'm mostly pleased with the end result. Of course the majority of people here need no introduction to the boys and their work, but I did want to share it here if anyone is interested. Time stamps are in the description if you want to view only certain parts. Also, I am doing a giveaway for anyone who likes the video and leaves a comment, because I wanted to do something nice for ARMYs, new or old. :)

OP said the owner told them the boys might be coming back in October of this year to do a full stadium tour. To be honest I don't know if I believe that, it just seems way too soon. I don't think they'll come back until at least summer of 2020 maybe? I do believe the next time they come back they will have a full stadium tour though. What is your opinion on this?

The first round of voting closed earlier today, so I went ahead and prepared the final round voting form for you. To reiterate, these are **the top 5 nominations** from the [first round](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/aim5xm/rbangtan_awards_2018_first_round_is_open/). All categories got more than 5 nominations, yay!

#A few things about the form:

- Linking to things on Google Forms is clunky and only pictures or YouTube links can be embedded. That's why most of the nominations are linked in a separate section underneath each poll. This can look pretty weird, but I tried my best to include all the relevant links from the nominations this way (and add some pictures where applicable)!

- Similarly to last year, the ""Best V Live"" category was split basically into Run and non-Run. This way we can celebrate both the Run episodes and the member lives :)

- Some of the nominations were edited for clarity and readability. You can still see the original nominations in the first round threads.

- The order of the list of nominees doesn't have significance other than how it was convenient for me to list them while formatting this.

- You don't need to sign in to vote, but it would be a bummer if this was manipulated in some way as it's supposed to be just for fun! Also please don't share the link outside this subreddit, as the awards are meant for the /r/bangtan community :)

- **I'll keep the voting open for about a week. This would be approximately until February 5th 9 PM UTC.** Make sure to cast your votes before that.

That's it! Without further ado:

I had recently just discovered BTS from the radio where Waste It On Me was playing back in late October. I was so shocked that it was BTS because the lyrics were all in English and their pronounciation was so good. Also, I always thought Kpop was all Korean lyrics which is why I was surprised (Kpop isnt my taste in music so please excuse my ignorance, but I do quite enjoy BTS songs). This literally caught me off guard. So after a few days, I decided to search them up. I really did not know anything about them except for hearing them once from BBMAs. I became very fond of them and listened to their music. The song that really got me into being an ARMY was Save Me. The lyrics were so touching and the melody of the song was just breathtaking. And the simplicity of the MV was what made it so precious.

But I clearly have a few favourites. 

My favourites are Slow Rabbit, J Pearl and *obviously* Yoongi the most. This could be because of my love for Hip Hop.  


I feel like Yoongi just experiments and oozes pure creativity sometimes. That's the joy of making music I really feel that it creates itself and hes just some sort of conduit. 

He literally plays around with different instruments and chord progressions until he finds something that sounds pretty yet gritty (?). A good example of experimentation would be I NEED U X SEESAW. However, I've noticed Yoongi leans closer towards distorted organs and synths. (Dead Leaves, Tomorrow, etc)   
   
 He makes me feel. He makes me feel in the darkest pits of my stomach and the deepest memories of my mind.   
   
**So, who are you favourite producers?**   
 

Bonus question, why do you think we hear less of Yoongis productions in BTS albums as of late?   


I think its because the specific sound BTS is currently going for doesnt align with Yoongis productions. I could be totally wrong.

I have doubt for Baz Luhrmann to do project like short films,music video, etc for BTS as his production budget usually so pricey. For example, his chanel ad  [No. 5 the Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hcaaKhGL00) cost 50mil usd, [The Get Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Get_Down) cost 120mil usd. I have doubt that bighit willing to invest THAT LOT for getting Baz Luhrmann to direct any of their work. 

Until lately, someone in sub came up with idea hoping for BTS attending Met Gala 2019, its make me research about Met Gala more. And guess what,i found out that Baz Luhrmann was in charge for Met Gala 2018 stage including [Madonna performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVgE45ZYTfw).

I have some questions that have come to my mind because of recent conversations on other threads.  In one thread, I suggested that BTS should cut back on their award show appearances  especially the poorly organized ones giving out weird awards. Some people disagreed on the grounds that award shows provide good exposure to BTS and other groups.  In other thread, I saw people saying that BTS needs to increase its appearances on Korean variety shows in order to maintain its exposure to Korean general audiences. Recently, on a thread concerning the Met Gala, someone said that attending or performing at the Gala would give them good exposure. 

These comments have made me wonder about this thing called exposure. 

What is exposure, really? 

Is all exposure good? Are there bad kinds of exposure? 

Are there different kinds of exposure (like, I dunno, maybe exposure to the Korean general public, exposure to international audiences, exposure to influential people in the music industry, etc.)

Does BTS need more exposure in some ways? 

Could BTS be overexposed in some ways?

If there are any PR/Communications ARMYs that are familiar with the concept of exposure and can educate us, I would love it if you could chime in. I see the term used a lot but I dont think I know what it truly means or how it is measured. ",47,1,False,self,,,,,

I get happy because I get to see how far they've come, and then I get pangs of worry/guilt that they pushed so hard to make us happy, then towards the end I'm overwhelmed with joy because our boys have made it! 
They aren't waiting for the fall anymore, their wings are opened fucking wide and they are soaring. It's a feeling I can't explain, but I love it, and I love that I have played a part in this epic story of their life. 

One of the reasons I'm able to feel so much happiness for people I've never met, is because they have legit taken me on the ride with them. I was there when they lived in a really small dorm, I was there when they went to an award show expecting nothing, and was just as shocked as they were when they got a Daesang. I was there when they went overseas to an American award show and no one knew what to expect, they did vlives to show us what was going on and they looked so nervous and excited, and at the end of the night they celebrated their win with us. 

These last 2 years have been like a non stop ride to the top, and I've shared so many experiences with them. I've watched them grow, and change individually and as a group. But I think they have taken the hint, ARMY is going nowhere anytime soon, and they just seem so much more relaxed. We didn't build them up, just to break them down and I think they are just now seeing that. Actions speak louder than words, like when people do trust falls, Bangtan have just let it go. They know we are gonna catch them. Finally!

I'm not saying that it means they won't continue to work just as hard to keep ARMY happy, but that they aren't gonna beat themselves up about it if they fall short. Because we have accepted them as they are, perfectly imperfect. That makes me so happy, because it opens so many more doors for them to be able to experiment and try new things and continue to grow.

Not only that, but they have damn near kicked everyone's ideas on fashion, music, stereotypes, friendship, fan service, fandoms, heartthrob, masculinity, what is sexy, makeup, limits, misconceptions, assumptions, skinship, and love, (I could go on forever) upside down and out the window.

Does anyone else feel like they are more relaxed, and like themselves, or am I reaching and I just want to believe that?

Whew, that turned into a novel. I beg your pardon.
