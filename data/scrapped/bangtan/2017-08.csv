It's us again, and we will really keep this as short as possible. 



**We have decided to extend our deadline for the JK and RM projects to August 6 11:59 pm.**

We weren't going to write more posts regarding these projects, but it has come to our attention that some email entries may have ended up in the spam folder due to having large file sizes attached. Whilst we have done our best to recover as much of it as possible, it is possible that some messages are missing despite our best efforts. We're so incredibly sorry about this. Due to this situation, we have extended the deadline for all entries to **August 6 11:59 pm**. If you see this information after the new deadline has passed, but have previously sent in a submission, please forward the original email and we will process your entry as normal. 

We will do our best to get confirmation emails as soon as possible. 



**IMPORTANT**: If you submitted a photo or fanart entry by email before **July 19**, particularly if your email was over 10mb in size, or if you're otherwise concerned about your entry, please get in contact with us as soon as possible, especially if you have yet to receive a confirmation message. You can PM us (u/BTSprojects) or send us an email through armysunite@hotmail.com (please remember to put either JUNGKOOK or RAP MONSTER in your subject line). You may have to resend your entry. Were so sorry for any inconvenience caused. 

In the meantime, if you send an email with large attachments, please shoot us a PM or send us a text only email with the same subject line so we're aware that we've received something from you. 

For the #ARMYmusic entries, we have received a high volume of entries. Thank you for your enthusiasm! However, we ask that you to please limit your entries to maximum 10 songs per submitter due to the available page space. 



##Please see the full [**JK project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project/) and [**RM project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e7j/rms_17_birthday_project/) posts for details on how to submit entries. 



Paired with each project will be a charity donation as our gift to the boys. 

* Paired with JK's project is a **charity donation to BAPS** ([Busan Abandoned Pet Sanctuary](http://shindogs.org/)), a no-kill shelter in Busan, as he has [mentioned](http://www.vlive.tv/video/17071) wanting to help abandoned dogs in the past. 

* Paired with RM's project is a donation in his name to charity donation in his name to **[WE Charity/Free the Children](https://www.we.org/)**, as we wanted to make a donation to a charity focusing on [furthering children and youth education](https://www.we.org/gb/about-we-charity/about-us/).

As always, **the coordinating team will try to cover all printing+shipping costs**. However, if you'd like to help us cover the costs you can do so [here](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). **We are using the same link for both projects for covering shipping costs and for charity donations** so we ask that you please specify what you want your money to go towards in the comments box. We have made [a guide here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-hQrLJ_SjRPwO8jxx); please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6pd3o7/update_and_reminder_jk_and_rms_birthdays/) for more details. 

The deadline for donations for both projects will close at **15 August at 11.59 pm US CENTRAL time**. 



Alrighty, that's it for now! Thank you to all of you who have already submitted content ^ u ^ We haven't been able to send everyone a confirmation message yet, due to the number of submissions; however, please give us until the end of the first week of August (for those who have submitted before the initial deadline 3 August, and please allow a few more days for those who submit by the end of the new deadline) to send out everyone a message :)

Thank you guys for reading all the way through. We're sorry about the inconvenience once again.

[This video](https://youtu.be/DB_AP7DLQ0w?t=3m49s) is the most viewed translation of The Last, but the translation of the last two lines are wrong - they just copied and pasted from the previous verse.

Alternatively, I found this translation:
> **Sorrow created me (uh) look at me closely (uh)** 

> **Selling ourselves or not you all say** 

> **It's not that we couldnt do it, but that we didnt want to, shit**

Which makes more sense, but the last line is still unclear to me.

My guess is that he's saying something along the lines of
> **Selling ourselves or not, it's not that you didn't do it, it's that you couldn't**

Or is he saying
> **Selling ourselves, it's not that we couldn't do it, it's that we didn't**

Or something else?

I really need an answer to this mystery.

About 2 months ago [we asked for donations to make the 1st BTS Billboard in Singapore happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6icd1r/bts_in_music_bank_world_tour_in_singapore/). And I'm happy to share that our project was succesful! 

[**The Video Billboard, #1stBTSBillboardInSG,**](https://twitter.com/BTSMuBankInSG/status/893303684481798144) went live from 7 AM - 11 PM yesterday, 4 Aug 2017. [This is the full HQ ad with audio](https://twitter.com/BTSMuBankInSG/status/893305310495916036).  

The billboard was located at Suntec Convention Centre building, which is where the Music Bank World Tour event was held. The billboard is also situated right opposite the hotel where all the idols were staying, so we hope BTS themselves have seen our ad and felt welcomed in Singapore!

As of now, the video has been retweeted by major accounts like BTS National, BTS_SG, peachisoda and more, with over 7k RTs and over 14k likes and counting! Kkaepjjang~

It was very difficult to reach the funding goal for this project within a month. The cost of the billboard was $1,444, and at the end of the donation period we received only close to $300 in donations. But because the payment due date was looming close, co-organizer /u/muffsuga and I, and another generous twitter user [@milksyub](https://twitter.com/miIksyub), managed to cover the remaining amount. It was our first time doing a fundraising fan project, and we surely learnt a lot from this experience :)

We would also like to thank the lovely redditors who donated to this project, even though many of you guys aren't even Singaporean ARMYs. You guys are amazing!!!

This was a really fun experience, and we look forward to planning more large scale fan projects like this one in the future. Until then... strong power thank you!

I wasn't really into Spring Day when it first came out. The tone was too sad for my taste. I was more into BTS's hype songs like Dope, Fire, Not Today, BIL, even INU, etc. It wasn't until I saw it live that I began to fully appreciate the song. Months later I'm learning it on piano and I'm just so obsessed with the intro. Tbh, it takes a while for me to warm up to BTS's slower songs but songs like Dead Leaves, Whalien 52, Rain, Young Forever, and Haruman.

Another interesting one of mine is War of Hormone (aka the first BTS song I ever listened to). Wasn't really my style when I first heard it and the lyrics are questionable but I guess it's grown on me because of nostalgia.

I have A LOT of favorites because their older albums are gold, but here is a small selection:

* I Like It

* Coffee

* Satoori Rap (check out the live performance with all 7 members!)

* If I Ruled the World

* Jump

* Tomorrow

* Where Did You Come From?

* Second Grade (I love this song WAY more than I should. Dark&Wild is *the* album.)

Over the past few months, my friends and I have been compiling fansites for the sake of easier cross-referencing and we can now finally show you the fruits of our labour. 

***


#The Spreadsheet

First things first, we gotta show you the [spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-oyrp03WoGgxBuqplk2FwM9eOv55sm-JzrvCogpSHQo/edit?usp=sharing) Most of the things on this post will be included in the spread sheet so don't worry! Well, every member (even OT7) will have their own separate sheet for easy viewing. The spreadsheet covers pretty much most of a fansite's information, their Twitter, website, Instagram, YouTube, Weibo and any other SNS they would use. All the information will be listed under the appropriate heading. If the following information does not exist for the fansite, the cell will be grey. Also, there is a note column that will include information like if it's a fansite for more than 2 members, if the account is privated or other information like that.

#What's a Fansite?

Oh boy, a fansite is an ARMY/ group of ARMYs who go to BTS events to take pictures of our boys so that they can then share this picture with the rest of ARMY via SNS (mostly Twitter). They also organise some projects and gifts for our boys via the sale of their photos. [Some](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCSlMVpUIAICs8A.jpg) [of](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBzJsvhV0AEwZaD.jpg) [them](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxrDL0AVEAAXcJA.jpg) [take](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvyoItEUAAANzjk.jpg) [some](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBzeTwEUIAACbz9.jpg) [really](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1F2TsRWgAEc9oV.jpg) [breathtaking](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1FrdZiUoAEot8k.jpg) [photos](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cy_iy9AUAAEH25q.jpg). (Some fansites are very cautious about re-uploads though, so please ask them/check their Twitter before you intend to use any of their images)

#How It Works

There's a few parts to this:


1. **How do I find stuff:** Use control + F OR command + F! Type in the fansite you want to find, click on the 3 dots at the right of the search bars and then click to search ""All Sheets"". **If you really can't find it:**  firstly, are you sure...? If you are certain a fansite isn't there please refer to *Enquiries and Contact Information.*


2. **I found a uncredited photo in the wild and I want to find out who took it:** Look at the photo carefully! There is most likely a logo in one of the corners of the picture. If not, just scan the whole picture to look for it. It's usually small white text or an image of sorts hidden in the image. **Not there?** *Please refer to Enquiries and Contact Information*


3. **I've checked the sheets thrice and I know a fansite you haven't added yet/ you're missing some fansite information:** Please add it via the [Fansite Addition Form.](https://goo.gl/forms/qUhg3MYk82LUhlnF3) and read the instructions carefully. We will get to your request shortly and add it to the list!

#Future Updates

We are working on including the logos and preview logos for the spreadsheet too. The Jimin sheet has been completed by the lovely, /u/chimothypark. As for the rest of the sheets, it will probably be done in the next few months or so. We honestly don't have a lot of time to work on it daily since we're mostly students or working, but please look forward to that update o3o

#Enquiries and Contact Information

If you have any questions/feedback or /really/ can't find a fansite, kindly PM me here or ask on curiouscat via my twitter @nyoomgis. Please don't bombard me with questions especially if you haven't read this post or at least the TL;DR, I'm a student and I really can't keep up TT

THANK YOU FOR READING AND YOU BETTER USE THIS SPREADSHEET RESPONSIBLY.

#TL;DR

##There's a fansite spreadsheet that my friends and I made so that we can  spice up your life. It includes most of the information you'd need. You can look for fansites on this spreadsheet! If you find an uncredited picture in the wild don't fret, you can use this spreadsheet as a reference. If you want to give some feedback or have enquiries, please PM me.",37,143,False,self,,,,,

**Seo Taiji x BTS, Coming together as Seo Taiji and Boys**

*Two icons representing their generations, Seo Taiji and BTS are joining together as Taiji Boys.*


Seo Taiji announced on the 27th that At the Seo Taiji 25th Anniversary performance Lottecard Moov: Soundtrack Vol.2 <SeoTaiji 25>, Seo Taiji and the members of BTS plan to come together and perfectly reproduce the original songs of SeoTaji and Boys and revealed that it will be an unprecedented stage, in which, two icons of their respective generations will come together as SeoTaji and Boys, a symbolic name in our pop music history.


Seo Taiji and BTS, will be performing a selection of songs from Taiji Boys 1-4th albums, which shook up Korean society each time they were announced. Each member of BTS will be able to show their full individuality and abilities to the fullest, not just with their music but they are also planning to faithfully recreate the iconic Taiji choreographies that resonated with the youths of that time period.


This stage, where two musicians that span generations come together, has a special meaning. Seo Taiji is a unique Korean musician, who needs no long explanation. This year, BTS was the first K-Pop group to win a Billboard Music Award and rewrite Korean Pop Music history. These two Korean musical icons will become one with the music of Seo Taiji, which forever changed the popular music scene, and will put on a stage that transcends generations. Seo Taji is preparing thoroughly with song selection, composition and stage production for this one-time-only stage. 


In particular, Seo Taiji has said that you will able to hear the original SeoTaiji and Boys sound through this concert. For the original sound stages, together with BTS, who have shown great vocal, rap and dance skills, the plan is to turn time backwards for the 90s SeoTaiji generation of the past and for the new audiences to experience a new world.


Seo Taiji relayed, Sending special thanks to the members of BTS, whos wonderful remake is a given and are working hard in order to put on the greatest stages.


Lottecard Moov: Soundtrack Vol.2 <Seo Taiji 25> will be held on September 2 at Seoul Jamsil Olympic Stadium, the largest venue in Korea. In addition, For Seo Taijis 25th Debut anniversary, talented juniors will be remaking his famous songs. The remake project consists of BTS, Urban Zakapa, Younha, Loopy and Nafla, etc and the participating musicians will be releasing their songs in order.",16,84,False,self,,,,,

We have a few changes to announce regarding rules and content, so please make sure to read this post in its entirety.

***

##1. New Moderators

As we mentioned [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6e21gw/170529_subreddit_updates/) and again [16 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6p5csw/now_hiring_moderators_for_rbangtan/), we have been looking for moderators to help keep this sub as lovely as it is as it grows (since the current mod team can only do so much on our own). We read through all 14 applications submitted, and decided on 2 candidates who we thought best met what we were looking for.


So, without further ado, please welcome our new /r/bangtan mods:


#/u/NorikaN and /u/MelodyRaindo!

Feel free to ask them questions in the comments!

##2. Easily answered questions, repeated discussions, where to buy and fashion threads

These will be moved to our Weekly Room from now on. They should be posted as a reply to AutoModerators stickied comment at the top of the thread. This way you guys can ask anything and not invoke the wrath of older users or clutter the sub with old questions or discussions. You can also post showerthoughts there or just in the thread in general. Clothing/fashion and picture/gif identification should also go there. We also always had the Twitter username of users who identify clothing items in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/websites). 

##3. Picture threads

Threads asking for pictures will be removed from now on. You can [easily join our Discord chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord) (which has member specific channels with new pictures updated daily and a channel for picture dumps) or you can search them up on Twitter/Tumblr. We also have [this brand new, amazing fansite masterlist!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6rwj6i/ultimate_fansite_spreadsheet/)  

##4. New FAQ!  

To aid in the above changes, we are going to revamp the FAQ section to actually answer way more of the questions we see asked here so often. These include, but are not limited to:  

* Where is a good place to buy merch?  
* What is the fancafe?  
* What are fansites? Where can I find a list of them?  

We would like to ask for all of you to help us come up with some other common or easily answered questions that we can add here, so we can remove and answer these easily answered and repetitive questions with a quick link. So if you have any others, please let us know below or via modmail! You don't necessarily have to write the answer too, just the question would be a big help!   

***

Thats all, folks!

This has the 2nd Muster and also other things from 2016. I would love to see the 3rd Muster as well, but from what I can gather the DVD set for that was released months ago and is now sold out. Do these sorts of things ever come back in stock or have I missed my chance at it? 

And can anyone explain why they are just now releasing the 2nd Muster, which happened a year and a half ago, AFTER the 3rd Muster, which happened much more recently?

I'm still relatively new to ARMY and trying to get my bearings when it comes to merchandise releasing. ",5,9,False,self,,,,,

BTS are nominated in two categories and the awards are very popular and important. Voting ends on the 30th of August.

There are plenty tutorials how to create accounts and vote (just search for ""soribada vote""). You can use computer or mobile phone app. 

Remember to vote every day, as you get one vote for each category per day. I also created several accounts. If you use the app, there is a limited number of accs you can create but you can just use the mobile website.

You also have to use real emails, gmail is pretty good for creating several Accounts.

With RMusic, Vlives, and interview questions, the boys have given us plenty of American artists to appreciate. 

The ones that stuck with me the most are:

* Charlie Puth - JK
* Vic Mensa - RM
* Halsey - BBMAs
* Steve Aoki - Twitter
* Kyle - J-hope
* Ty Dolla $ign - Jimin
* Hillsong Young & Free - Tae
* Wiz Khalifa - JK & Jin

If you haven't checked these out already, you might enjoy them!!!

Like many k-pop fans, I wasn't so up to date on the American music scene before this push from BTS... and my tastes have actually expanded so much from checking out their recommendations.

217,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2017-8-12,2017,8,12,8,6t55lt,self.bangtan,So my mom met Suga's brother...,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6t55lt/so_my_mom_met_sugas_brother/,vanjs,1502495695,"I guess 'meeting' is too formal, more like she just went to eat at the restaurant with my sister and saw him by chance. Anyways nothing really happened and it's not that interesting of a story but my friend said it was funny and encouraged me to share it for some laughs. (Note: I am still in Canada, only my sister/mom went back to Korea for vacation because I had school).

Me: (3 a.m, still writing an essay) 'Oh my god, I should go to sleep. I need to wake up at 8:30 tomorrow if I want to get a good spot in the library.'

5:30 a.m: (Kakaotalk keeps ringing)(hundreds of messages start pouring in)(phone is blasting my 'Not Today' ringtone)(Skype music on my iPad blares)

Mom: (keeps calling)

Sister: (keeps calling)

Sister: (by message) 'Dude you have to wake up RIGHT NOW or you're gonna regret for life'

*Note: I am a SUPER heavy sleeper so I kept missing the call because I was in dreamland, not because I was ignoring them.

Me: (stumbles out of bed and trips on a chair) 'Wha-do you know what time it is here?!'

Sister: 'guess where we're at?'

The moment I saw the family portrait with BTS in the corner I knew exactly where they were at. I was still super groggy so I was like 'Oh! You're at his moms restaurant, aren't you?'

Sister: 'Yeah! Let me give you a tour!'

It was actually a lot wider than I thought and a lot cozier. Y'all have probably seen the pictures already so I won't elaborate too much but there were a lot of pictures of BTS/Suga and a LOT of Kumamon.

Mom: 'They don't mind photos or videos but you can't take pictures of his brother or his mom.'

Me: 'Wait, wtf? His brother is here?!'

Mom: 'Yeah. He's tall and good looking. What happened to Suga?' (obviously a joke)

I accidentally got a glimpse of him while my sister flipped the camera and they look alike in some places and not alike in others, idrk, but he was pretty tall and good looking. Pretty humans must be a thing in his family >:T

Mom: 'Suga's pretty cute though. Looks like he sent his mom a little commemorative wreath/plant thing' (there's photos of this everywhere too) but basically it says 'I hope you hit jackpot mommy -Suga' (which is pretty adorable lol).

Me: 'Yeah, ofc he is. Why are you guys there? You don't like soondaeguk'

Mom: 'Yeah, but she sells other things too like seolleongtang' (which has been my favourite dish since I was younger).

Me: 'How was it?'

Mom: 'It was pretty good. We got some for you.'

Me: 'Wait, what? You're not coming back to Canada until next week and I won't be back until next Friday. How would you bring soup back?'

Mom: 'We got it frozen. The lady originally said that's not allowed but Suga's brother made an exception since you're so far away.'

Me: 'You're kidding me, right?'

Mom: 'Nah. We've done this before, remember?' (From a different restaurant).

Me: 'Cool! Thanks.""

So my mom and my sister have paid and are getting to leave. I ask a few more questions (especially about the line) and my sister said there was no line and it was empty-ish (thank god because the first few weeks had lines that were 2-3 hours long). As they were leaving though, the brother also went outside and my mom was like 'this is your chance! Ask him something!'

And I don't know what was wrong with me but I thought 'well... he's probably sick of the fangirls by now' so instead of using that one chance to ask him something about Suga, I just asked 'Um... is your ox Korean? (for the broth)' and everyone started laughing (sigh) and he was like 'Yes. I hope you can come in person next time' and I was just like 'oh, okay, thanks!' and my fam left.

Kinda heartbreaking to know that this is as close as I'll get to Suga as possible (his mom wasn't there) but his brother seemed really sweet, at the very least. And that wreath thing still makes me chuckle.

After I woke up I was so exhausted I ended up not going to the library anyways (lol) but because it all happened in the middle of the night, it kinda feels like a dream. Anyways, it's not THAT particularly interesting and I'm sorry if I wasted someone's time but yeah. I thought I could spice up the subreddit a lil with a small story :)

EDIT: after re-reading I feel like I should clarify something. First of all, Suga is my #1, all-time bias (I love all the members but I got into BTS due to Suga). Second of all, my mom/sister didn't go to Daegu just for me LOL, they went because that's actually our hometown (and apparently it's like 15 mins away?). And finally, my mom said they're hiring LOL but they probably only hire older people who aren't BTS fans (I remember when Zico opened up his shop there were lines to apply to work there LMAO).",55,177,False,self,,,,,

So, I was wondering if anyone knows whether there are any other well known producers or mix engineers that BigHit and BTS have worked with in the past and if there's a chance that they might work again with them on future records as well?

James F Reynolds is credited for the mixing of BS&T.

I expected them to move on to something new completely, considering how often they've stated that the HYYH era is completed. I assumed that it was only me and other people will be excited for this development. However, after seeing people's reactions in r/kpop and in other discussion threads here in this sub, it is apparent that many people don't like what BigHit is doing. To me it seems this move is extremely risky on BigHit's part. I am worried that BTS's momentum will decrease. What do you guys think?

I realized there are sooooo many alliterations, metaphors, cultural contexts, and general power put into lyrics that lose a lot of their touch when we translate them. If a lot of their lyrics blow us away in English, I can only imagine their impact in the original context. I've heard a lot of people talk about how once they learn Korean/if they speak Korean it's almost like a different song.

To anyone that can answer, what are some lyrics that are more powerful/can't be translated into English that you want to highlight to those of us who don't speak Korean? I've always been curious heheh.

Firstly, I've had a look at all of their astrological charts and there's one thing that's quite interesting - a lot of the members of BTS have the planet Mercury in retrograde. Specifically, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Jungkook have this planet (and in Suga's case, a lot of other planets, wow does he have an introspective chart) in retrograde motion. Considering that Mercury is actually only in retrograde for a few weeks every year, that's quite a coincidence. BUT WAIT. THERE'S MORE.

Their ""big breakthrough"" with I Need U happened JUST BEFORE Mercury was about to go retrograde, pretty much as Mercury was entering into what I've seen called the pre-shadow period.

The day BTS won Artist of the Year at the MAMA awards happened JUST BEFORE Mercury was about to go retrograde, in the same pre-shadow period as they got all of their wins for ""I Need U"".

The day they won the Billboard award? Well, that was JUST AFTER Mercury passed out of the retrograde shadow.

And their comeback? Well, it's due for September. We're currently in a retrograde Mercury period. If I'm right about this, and we're heading for a mid-September comeback...well, we'll be right at the end of the retrograde shadow period once again...so this could be extremely interesting...

The currently most viewed MVs are (update: 14.08.2017, 17:41)
#1 BTS _ DOPE (1theK, 197.795.531 ~~so close~~) 
#2 BTS _ FIRE (1theK, 185.932.321)
#3 BTS _ Blood Sweat & Tears (ibighit, 168.313.955).  

I am not sure about the rules to follow if you want to stream. If I am listening to BTS tho, I am currently mostly focused on these MVs and using some playlist like this.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4PwI0w9L_U8YExC3FcfCjt1i9OryWfLs

Not saying that you should stop enjoying their music and just keep on repeating three songs but if you are streaming anyway, we could try to get the 200 mio. views first as this would get more attention!    

Hyping for the comeback. ~~

Edit; just changing some numbers.  

Edit; Instead of streaming BST, you can also try to achieve 100 mio. views for e.g. [MV] BTS() _ I NEED U on 1theK (83.285.020 views, 14.08.2017, 17:17).",17,46,False,self,,,,,

So I'm not part of a lot of BTS-related communities, I'm just on Reddit, but I know this community (and r/kpop) skews older. Here the reaction was very positive with some concern about the execution of the concept and what it means for HYYH. But I know it may not be really super representative of the fandom as a whole. I gathered the reaction was not so positive ? I'd especially like to know the reaction of kfans and jfans. Can someone fill me in ?

Edit : okay I lurked a bit on OH and the reaction is also super positive, lots of theories everywhere and people are excited. I also went on Weibo (more manageable than Twitter idk how you guys use that hellish website) and I see disappointed fans saying it's not the Bangtan they fell in love with, but also people loving the girls and a lot saying (jokingly ? I don't speak Chinese very well, so irony would be lost on me) that they forgive them for being around girls and are excited. So positive mixed bag I'd say. ",63,39,False,self,,,,,
298,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2017-8-16,2017,8,16,19,6u1462,self.bangtan,Update and donation extension - JK and RM projects,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6u1462/update_and_donation_extension_jk_and_rm_projects/,BTSprojects,1502878914,"Hi there r/bangtan! We'll keep this as short and brief as possible. 

Now that deadlines for submissions for the JK and RM projects have closed, thank you so much for your entries to both projects; we're really grateful for the number of people who took the time to take part. We've had nearly 400 entries from dozens of people from all around the world! Due to various factors including being somewhat short staffed, unfortunately we haven't been able to send out all the confirmation emails yet but please be assured that we will by the end of this week. However, if you want to make sure your entry has reached us, please PM or email us as soon as possible. 

**If you live in Korea, or will be in Korea around the last week of August, and are willing to forward on the packages to BigHit, please PM or email us as soon as possible. If you may be available for future projects, please also let us know. We will reimburse you for all costs associated.**

&amp;nbsp;

Now for the main point of the post: 

**We have decided to extend the donation deadline for the JK and RM projects to 20 August 11.59pm.** 

Please note that donating is not mandatory for participating in our projects, and for these two projects, the coordinating team has decided to cover the entirety of the cost of printing + shipping so that as much money can be raised for the charities as possible. Ideally, we'd like to reach a charitable donation of at least USD$50 for each project. 

Since the J-Hope project earlier this year, paired with each one of our message books is a charity donation. As we can't all go to Korea, and we're all spread out across the world, we will be making a donation on their names from us here at the sub. We'd really like to be able join in together for good causes in the name of the boys for their birthdays, and all donations (regardless of amount) are greatly appreciated. 

&amp;nbsp;

Paired with [**Jungkook's**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e8g/jks_17_birthday_project) project is a charity donation to [**BAPS** \(Busan Abandoned Pet Sanctuary\)](http://shindogs.org/) that will be our gift to JK, as he has [mentioned](http://www.vlive.tv/video/17071) wanting to help abandoned dogs in the past. BAPS is known for being a no-kill based animal sanctuary in Busan (JK's hometown) that focuses on re-homing abandoned dogs. They do a lot of good work in helping abandoned dogs at a shoestring budget, including vaccinating all their dogs, providing medical care and a safe space for their dogs until they are adopted. 

Paried with [**Rap Monster's**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6l4e7j/rms_17_birthday_project) project will be a donation to to **[WE Charity/Free the Children](https://www.we.org/)**, as we wanted to make a donation to a charity focusing on [furthering children and youth education](https://www.we.org/gb/about-we-charity/about-us/). In Africa, Asia and Latin America, they partner with communities to help empower them through a holistic, sustainable international development model to help break the cycle of poverty, especially so that all children and youths have access to education and don't have to work to ensure their family's survival. They also have educational programs in the UK, US and Canada to inform students and give them the tools to create transformative social change. 

&amp;nbsp;

Once again, we'd like to note that donating is not mandatory for participating in our projects, and for these two projects, the coordinating team has decided to cover the cost of printing + shipping so that as much money can be raised for the charities as possible. Ideally, we'd like to reach a charitable donation of at least USD$50 for each project. If you'd like to make a donation, you can do so [**here**](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). We have made [a guide here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Anp7VWyYKIW-hQrLJ_SjRPwO8jxx) but in summary, please leave a note specifying the project you'd like to donate to, your contact details and credit in the following format: 
 
**PROJECT(s) (write any comments here, including if you would like to split your donation) / CONTACT (email or Reddit username) / cr: CREDIT (name(s) and username(s) you would like your donation to be credited towards)**

For example, if I wanted to donate to the RM project, I would write *RM project / u/BTSprojects / cr: Coordiunnies Team* in the comment box. 

If you would like to split your contribution to both projects, please specify the projects involved and how you'd like to split your contribution (e.g. JK + RM projects (50:50)). 

&amp;nbsp; 

Please also look out for posts on Jimin's birthday to come soon, as well as the opening post for the Secret Santa! 

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for your patience, and for supporting our projects -

Similarly for RM, but I would love it if he could get a radio spot like Jonghyun's Blue Night where he could just ramble and talk about his passions. 

J-Hope has a future in choreography and I think it would be amazing for him to hold dance workshops or open a dance school (a la Seungri). 

Although Jin's acting has a lot of room for improvement, that will come with experience and his acting has definitely been the most impactful for me based on the Highlight reels. He has the perfect flower boy looks for lighter dramas and as he matures, may get roles in more serious dramas as well. 

Tae's acting is also improving steadily and his ability will increase more as he takes acting classes and gains experience. I think his strength will be in more comedic roles though, although I'm ready to be surprised!

Jungkook I can see having a solo singing career that is at least moderately successful. I hesitate to say a ""hit"" because his stage presence and fan service is not as high as some of the other members and he really seems to feed off the others in both stage and on shows. In addition, although he has a pretty vocal tone that I love, it is technically weak and doesn't really seem like something that Korea favors in terms of solo vocalists (not sure - I'm just going off the solo albums that did well - ex. Taeyeon, Kyuhyun, Han Dong Geun - all of whom are known for technical proficiency). However, Jungkook always exceeds my expectations :)

Jimin I think has the most raw star power in the group. His stage presence is incredible (he's in the top 3 live and imo is the standout on video). Once he gets better vocal training, I can really see him taking a Taemin route for his career (less vocal and more dance focused). But also Jimin is extremely charismatic and is the king of fanservice, which goes a long way. He's also reasonably good at variety and bounces off others well. Something he does need is more confidence and belief in himself.",40,61,False,self,,,,,

My sister made Jungkook pins for KCON !! Although we were disappointed that they didn't bring BTS this year, we felt that we should carry a small piece of them with us while we attended! So this was the result. 


The design is a reference to Run BTS! Episode 20 where BTS had to complete a cooking challenge; Jungkook held up a plate of glazed sweet potatoes that stuck to the plate LOL. I guess you can say he can't . . . Jungcook.


Video link [here](https://youtu.be/Kf-iMfaDNcQ?t=12m50s) if you wanna watch it!


We hope you like the pins as much as we do ~ !!

Crazy as in, they had so many achievements during this time. Bon Voyage 1 was a learning experience for the boys. It was the first time that they were traveling like that with very minimal help from managers. Bon Voyage 2 came around and the boys are more experienced with this whole traveling thing. This trip is more organized by the producers also so the boys have more time to bond. In my opinion, the friendship trip was a success. I think all the boys learned so much from this trip which can strengthen bonds between members such as Tae and Yoongi, Jin and RM, etc. Also, the letters at the end though. They don't do this often so they see the letters as cringe at first. However as the letters started, the boys really poured their emotions out. I had a feeling that Jimin didn't know that Tae felt that way until the letter. 

I believe that the trip helped the boys renewed their friendship for each other. They have been working nonstop so they don't have time to sit down and reflect like that. They have been growing so fast that it was hard to have time to play around with each other. This trip gave them a reason to show each other how they feel although cringy, but it was the only moment they can be cringy. Times like these are when they realize how much they enjoy each other companies despite sometime disagreeing. They know that they can overcome that because of how much they respect each other. How do you think this season especially changed the boys bond with each other?",19,50,False,self,,,,,

When I graduated from high school, I wanted to be a teacher. Back then there was even less money to be made in that profession than there is today. My father told me to pick something else, and since he was paying for college, I chose Accounting. That major lasted 1 semester before I became a Personnel Administration major(trying to keep all my credits). A couple semesters later, I would become a History major (trying to get closer to teaching). My GPA wasn't horrible, but it was by no means consistent. A 3.5 one semester would be followed by a 1.7! I was going thru the motions since I couldn't study what I really wanted. I prefer to think of it as a time of personal growth and development. 
     After 5 yrs and no degree, I quit going to school, and joined the wonderful world of retail. After 8yrs and a new emphasis on paying educators better salaries, I decided to go back to school to get a degree in Education. I went part time for 4 more years, basically retaking everything. Due to misinformation, I was down to only my education classes left to take, when I was informed I couldn't take them simultaneously (it was not stated that way in the course catalog). This led to 1 final change of major to General Studies just to finally get out. In 2004 After making a 4.0 with the exception of 1 B, I finally had a Bachelor's degree. Now I just needed to go through an alternative certification program and I could finally teach.
     Then Hurricane Katrina happened (2005) and abruptly put an end to that plan. I ended up finding a program in Indiana that was a 3yr program condensed into 1 yr. So off I went even more determined now. It was not easy at all. I was homesick, had no real support structure in place, and the entire school system operated very different than what I was accustomed to. But I did it! In the spring of 2007 I was issued a Provisional Teaching Certificate in Secondary Social Studies by the state of Indiana.
     I returned to Louisiana (I live outside of New Orleans) and within a week I was employed by the Recovery School District in New Orleans. (So named due to poor performance and not due to storm recovery) It was a newly constructed portable school. We had no PA system, no bell system, no copy machine, very limited resources, and armed security guards. My day would begin at 5am and I didn't usually get home until 7-8pm, then had to eat, grade papers, create lessons, print out anything I needed, iron clothes, and pack a lunch. Bedtime ended up being around 1am. By week 10, we were on our 5 schedule change. I had 28 desks, 25 textbooks, and 1 class of 35 students while another class had  a total of 9. I was sexually propositioned by students, offered drugs by students (apparently ecstasy helps with migraines...who knew??) , and threatened with both bodily harm and a gun. I was totally overwhelmed, burning the candle at both ends, and stressed out of my mind. I got to the point I had anxiety attacks the whole commute. On week 7 I had a complete nervous breakdown. By week 10 I quit. It took well over a year to fully recover. I lost my provisional certification, and would have to do the entire certification process over in order to ever teach again. I worked so hard for my dream, but it was completely over.
     Surprisingly, this was when I learned the value of ""Love Yourself."" I think if I could have found the time to have some ""me time"", I might not have snapped. I had no way to decompress. I got to the point I was so disappointed in myself that it took years to finally work thru the feelings of being a total failure. People that know me are shocked that I couldn't handle the stress, because I do very well multitasking in stressful situations. I was filled with so much self-pity and self-loathing that there was no way I could have entered into any kind of new relationship. I had to learn how to let go of all those feelings. Until I could like myself again, there was no way anyone else could like me much less love me.
     I think this lesson is what BigHit and BTS has in mind with their new concept. Perhaps if some of us older fans share our personal experiences, then the younger fans may gain a better understanding of the concept. Hopefully we can spare them some of the pain that we went through. Not all life lessons have to be experienced personally for them to be learned. ",42,52,False,self,,,,,

I'm writing here to relay some information about an ongoing project for BTS's comeback! I'm working with several other groups around the world to try and reach our goal of 1 million pre-orders. 

The project will have three phases, and we have participating sites from various countries! The first phase (which is live now) is on Fanmaum. Here you can donate ""hearts"" to our project for free (I believe you also get 100 free ones if you join via the Android app? There's no iPhone app though so you'd have to go on via the website!). The ""hearts"" will convert to money at the end of our project, and those funds will be used to buy extra albums during pre-order to boost the total. The albums will be raffled off afterwards. 

I'm participating on behalf of USA, so you can see [my tweet here](https://twitter.com/BTS_Projects/status/900187222468681729) for how to participate in Fanmaum! Or you can go [here](https://fanmaum.com/projects/view/2182), directly to the Fanmaum page. I'll be updating as the other phases go live. 

The next phase will be fundraising, but this will vary by country. The third phase is group ordering, by country. If you haven't seen your country's fanbase participating in this project and they're interested, please let me know! We will ask that participants donate a little extra when buying the albums so that the extra money can be put towards more albums to raffle off and make the total go up! For USA, I plan to hold a raffle for merch (probably a summer package or something similar) for those who participate. It's going to be a bit different for each country, so if you have any questions, please comment and I'll do my best to answer them (or find out the answer from someone else and then get back to you~). 

Please help us reach 1 million for BTS's comeback! ",9,52,False,self,,,,,

I [previously wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6viy0e/project_for_btss_comeback_fanmaum_group_orders_etc/) about the FTTT project. This project is a group of fanbases and sites getting together to help BTS get 1 million pre-orders for their new album. 

The first part of our project was a [Fanmaum](https://fanmaum.com/projects/view/21820) fundraiser, that is still going on and anyone can participate in for free! 

Now that pre-order information has been released, we are starting our group orders! I'm managing the one for USA. If you're interested in joining, please see the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uHPXbeXrxXpIR2XCMaKTP9_10GJz8l2SfDbfPi2IiLg/viewform?edit_requested=true). We're working in conjunction with BTS_ANT_Intl (part of a big fanbase in Korea) to purchase the albums from Synnara. They will all count towards the charts. The price is $14/album. 

In addition to this, we're also holding an optional fundraiser with the GO. For USA, if you donate $5 extra, you'll be entered into a drawing for a free Summer Package. The $5 goes towards purchasing more albums to help drive up BTS's numbers. These albums will then be given away for free to USA ARMYs. You can still join the GO even if you don't want to participate in the fundraiser. 

Other countries are also participating, so check your local fanbases! If they aren't participating in FTTT, they may still be running an order of some sort. If you can't find one, let me know and I'll try to help you find one. 

EDIT: Deadline for Group Order is Sept. 10th!!

*Last updated 8/26/17*  

***

Hi, in order to stop all the small where do I buy ___? How do I do ___? newbie first-timer questions, I have decided to start writing this guide to help out all the new fans!  

If you have any extra resources, guides, or updates to include in this, please let me know in the comments and Ill update it! Some of these you don't even need money to help with!  


##What can I do before September 18?  

***

###Buy/Preorder the physical album  

[Here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DH8RFpkWAAI4Onz.jpg) is a nifty infographic of reliable online stores to preorder the album from.  

You can also join a GO (Group Order) for lower shipping costs, however these *can* be less trustworthy than buying it yourself from a shop. Often times it is 100% safe and cheaper though! [Here](https://twitter.com/namjoondarling/status/900875055936176128) is a twitter thread of a bunch of different GOs for different countries if youre interested in that! There's also the FTTT project, more about that in the next section...  

Other tips: Buying it with a poster gives you the choice of folded/unfolded. Folded means the poster will have crease marks in it, and unfolded means it will come in a tube!  

###International Fanprojects  

***

* [Donate to the Strong Power, Thank You project!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAIi-eUkFMuyBE_X1umNoMmSmJDXfJVMMojk0H6gqD_dpjKA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1) This project will gift the single to an ARMY who cant buy it themself on iTunes in order to help BTS chart on the Hot 100. You can also sign up to be gifted the song if you arent able to buy yourself!   

* [Fly To The Top Fanproject](https://twitter.com/FLYTOTHETOP_prj/status/900912224377724930) &lt;- You dont need money to support this one! EDIT: [Here's more information about it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6vyo6w/comeback_project_part_ii_usa_go_for_bts_her_album/)  

*If you know of any other fan projects please let me know!*  

###Melon Passes  

***

Buy a Melon pass to help BTS on Korean charts!  

Before you do that, you need to [make a MelOn Account.](http://dailynamjoon.blogspot.com/2016/09/how-to-create-melon-account-step-by.html) &lt;- this guide is outdated, but mostly correct, however you will need a KakaoTalk account to sign up now. If you find an updated version lmk...  

After doing that, you will need to buy a MelOn pass. You cant easily do this from outside of Korea, so you will need to wait for someone to do a group MelOn pass purchase. When I see people start to open them, I will link to them in this guide!  

[Here is a guide](https://bangtanintl.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/tutorial-how-to-stream-songs-on-melon-app/) for how to make sure your stream counts on MelOn. K-ARMYs usually make a specific playlist so that you can leave the playlist on in the background and have every songs stream count, and I will link that here when I see it!   

[This Twitter account](https://twitter.com/melonforbts) has more ways you can get Melon passes (sometimes for free) if you want to check it out!  

You can also look into getting Naver passes for free, per [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/dm4otjq/).

Also, searching """" or "" Love Yourself"" in Korean search engines like [Naver](http://www.naver.com/), [Daum](https://www.daum.net/), [Nate](http://www.nate.com/), [MelOn](http://www.melon.com/index.htm), etc. will help their social score/presence!    

##Hot 100 Preparation  

***

###Hot 100 Breakdown by % (though it varies a LOT, read more [here](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/ask-billboard/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work)):  

* Sales: 35-45%
* Airplay: 30-40%
* Streaming: 20-30%  

10 downloaded tracks = 1 album, and 1,500 plays on Spotify, Rhapsody, Tidal, Rdio, Beats, Google Play, Apple Music, Amazon Prime, Pandora and others + Youtube, Vevo = 1 album. 

* ***Note*: All of the following will only work if you are in the USA, or use a VPN/change your location to be in the USA. If you do this from outside the USA, it wont count towards Billboard; it will only count towards your own countrys chart (which can be good too!)**  

For VPN help, reference [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/dm4hmk3/).  
  
Basically, the main apps/things you will need to know how to use are:  

* **iTunes/Google Play/Amazon Prime/Tidal/Rhapsody**  
-Purchase the album/single from as many of these sites as possible. iTunes is the **MOST** important one to buy from though! I have listed them above in order of their market share (i.e. how much it matters. Basically iTunes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all though lmao. Make sure you change your iTunes acct to be located to the USA in order for it to count towards Hot 100!) You can also [gift the single](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201783) to friends and family to help out even more!  
* **Spotify**  
-YOU CAN STREAM ON SPOTIFY FOR **FREE**!! I repeat, Spotify is free to download/listen, youll just have to listen to ads every so often. Its best to focus on streaming just the title track. [Here's a guide for streaming on Spotify~](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4M2D5CUEAE5n_b.jpg). The suggested playlist for comeback time will be available soon. Make sure the region in your profile is set to USA (go to profile &gt; edit &gt; country to change this, might require a VPN to do so). You can use Spotify on your phone if you sign up for the free 30-day premium trial as well!  
* **Apple Music**  
-You can sign up for a 3-month free trial on Apple Music if you havent already used it! Spotify is more important than Apple Music in terms of market share though, so concentrate on that one if you can. Either one is still helpful though! :)  
* **Pandora**  
-I dont really know much about Pandora, but they recently added it as counting towards the Hot 100 as well. So do that too if you can!
* **Shazam**  
-This is important for potential radio play, guide to Shazam [here](https://twitter.com/joonfiIm/status/900813175343460357) 
* **Youtube**   
-Increasing Youtube views also counts towards the Hot100! [Here are some tips for streaming.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4M2D_rVUAAsk9_.jpg)  

Some other Youtube Tips:  

-Doing this on different devices (as in, your phone, tablet, computer, apple watch, your mom's computer, smart TV, any device that can access youtube) will help a LOT! (make sure you aren't logged into the same account on all of them though)  
-Send it to your friends to get their views in too! Share on social media! Every click counts~  
-Try to clear your cookies/youtube watch history every so often. [Heres how](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/95725?hl=en). Alternatively, you can just close and re-open your incognito browser to do the same thing.  

* [This Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BTS_Billboard) and [this account](https://twitter.com/BTSonHot100) give a bunch of updates/ideas for contributing towards Billboard charts, so check it out for more things you can do!  
* As for radio play, [this twitter account](https://twitter.com/BTSRequest) is trying to organize mass request movements for different radio stations around the USA.  

##Music Shows

However, from my experience, most things that become mainstream also get a lot of hate, especially if they are overplayed on the radio. Most people I know have a lot of hatred to a vast majority of popular songs that get played on the radio a lot, and I'm wondering if that's something you would be willing to put up with for mainstream success or if there is a different path you want BTS to go.

Edit: I'm not suggesting that we as ARMYs have or should have any control over Big Hit/Bangtan's decisions. What I want to know is what you as a fan would say is the absolute best situation they can be in by the peak/end of their careers.",34,34,False,self,,,,,

Today was our last day in Oahu, so I arranged to meet with a friend that I made over kpop twitter. We made an appointment to get a pair of henna tattoos in Honolulu, matching the henna's we saw on Taehyung's ankle in the airport. When it was time for the appointment, the lady, Carolyn, wasn't there yet. Honestly, the building seems kind of sketchy and we debated finding another henna shop nearby. Instead, we texted her and she told us she was coming straight from a henna party at the beach (which was totally fine, we weren't in a rush). Once she got there, we showed her a picture of the moon tattoo, embarrassed that we were asking her to copy a grainy paparazzi photo of a man's ankle. She laughed, looked me straight in the eye and said ""I did this tattoo."" My friend and I were like ""mmmhm okay lady,"" but then she started to tell us about the day he stopped by. She said that she got a weird call to make an appointment for after hours, meaning security had to come and personally let them in because the complex was closed. She accepted the request because they had told her it was their last day in Hawaii and they really wanted henna. Prior to this she knew nothing about kpop. Carolyn said she could tell Taehyung was famous because he had an entire entourage. Everyone was dressed really nicely and Tae was standing tall and handsome as usual. I asked her if any of the other BTS members were with him and she said she didn't think so and how everyone seemed to be paying attention to him, like he was the only celebrity in the room. There was this woman who seemed in charge with a huge bow on her head and lense-less glasses, and typically Carolyn never asks for pictures but she got the courage to ask and the manager woman gave her a hard no with ""x"" arm motions and everything. Taehyung was super sweet and they had requested that the henna be kinda hidden. She suggested the sun and the moon, which he instantly agreed to (my moonchild, aww) and he had let her take a picture of the henna on his ankles. After Carolyn told us this story, she starts to pull her phone out and pull up a picture taken on April 12th, of Taehyung's feet, that she's NEVER. POSTED. We asked her if we could take a picture of her picture and instead she offers to send them to us personally. SO NOW MY FRIEND AND I ARE THE SECOND AND THIRD PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS HD CLOSE UP PICTURE. IM NOT EVEN INTO FEET OR ANYTHING BUT THIS WAS SOME GOOD CONTENT. I asked her if it was okay if we posted the picture and she said absolutely! After all that fangirling, WE SAT IN THE SAME SEAT AS TAEHYUNG and I got the moon while my friend got the sun. Shout out to her for being so cool and dealing with our squealing. If you're ever in the area, it's Honolulu Henna and her instagram is @honoluluhenna! She's super sweet and laid back and does a great job!

I love how the more hype songs are bass line heavy like 'Not Today' and 'Fire' and some of the softer ones such as 'Spring Day' and 'Reflection' by Namjoon. Additionally, why are the instrumentals never released? Fans end up having to make their own, which as you could imagine would never amount to the original.

Whichever choreography gets the most votes will be eliminated from future rounds. A new round ^(usually) gets posted every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

Ooohhhh goddddd. This took me way too much time... Well, uh, first of all, I first tried to add ALL of Bangtan's choreographies in a single round but strawpoll only allows 30 poll options (there were 37 cheoreographies, iirc), soo... I've decided to do only title track choreos for this round. Then we do all the b-side choreos in a second round. Sounds good?

P.S., I know some of these songs aren't actually considered title tracks, but for simplicity's sake I considered every song with an MV a title track. ^\(And ^(also because I had to add more songs to this survivor so all the rest could fit in the next) ^one).

1. They followed BTS pre-debut
2. They really digged the songs that went hard with very strong rapping/hiphop sound like the ones in School Trilogy era to Dark and Wild.
3. Most of them left either during the Wings era (they were still there during HYYH) 

I wonder if there are other fans here who digged that image/concept/sound more from them as well? I got into them during Dark n Wild era so I guess I'm in the middling ground. I realize I play stuff like Attack on Bangtan, We On, We Are Bulletproof part 2 and Spine Breaker a lot but I also loved the whole Wings discography/image. I always felt BTS in general have a lot of soul/passion so they continue having that Bangtan trademark regardless of genre, though I do know a lot of old-time fans are clamoring for their old sound so many were super happy when Come Back Home came out (enough it brought one of my former ARMY friends interested in them again)",67,62,False,self,,,,,

A strategic way to go about this is to be more united and request a song that is public-friendly in the US so that BTS can gain more leverage. 

What song do you think would work well in the US and should be unanimously requested bu fans?

A lot has been said about ClearChannel/iHeartRadio and how they have corporate playlists and it's hard to get songs added on the local level. Although it definitely can happen since the Oklahoma station that played BST the other day is an iHeartRadio station.

But the station that played BTS tonight in Wisconsin is under the company Entercom. And according to Entercom:

&gt;Programming decisions and music selections for Entercom stations are made at the local station level.  Entercom does not maintain corporate playlists.  

So perhaps we should focus on requesting the song at stations that are under broadcasting companies without corporate playlists. For Entercom their CHR or contemporary hits radio stations are:

&amp;nbsp;

**Buffalo, NY** - Kiss 98.5 - [kiss985.com](http://www.kiss985.com) - [@kiss985buffalo](https://twitter.com/kiss985buffalo)

**Greenville, SC** - B93.7 - [b937.com](http://www.b937.com) - [@B937Allthehits](https://twitter.com/B937AlltheHits)

**Indianapolis, IN** - 99.5 - [wzpl.com](http://www.wzpl.com) - [@wzpl](https://twitter.com/wzpl)

**New Orleans, LA** - B97 - [b97.com](http://www.b97.com/) - [@b97](https://twitter.com/b97)

**Rochester, NY** - 98 PXY - [98pxy.com](http://www.98pxy.com/) - [@98PXYRochester](https://twitter.com/98PXYRochester)

**Sacramento, CA** - 106.5 The End - [endonline.com](http://www.endonline.com/) - [@end1065](https://twitter.com/end1065)

**Wilkes-Barre, PA** - 98.5 KRZ - [985krz.com](http://www.985krz.com/) - [@985wkrz](https://twitter.com/985wkrz)

&amp;nbsp;

So I think it could be a good starting to point to try requesting these stations play BTS through Twitter.

Also, if you live close to any of these places you can check out their websites and call the request line. I guess we could call from anywhere, but it could possibly be better if the calls come from an area code near where the station is. 

So yeah, does anyone have other ideas on how to best request stations play BTS?

An update on our JK and RM projects: whilst we have basically finished the books, due to various real life circumstances (including ex-Hurricane Harvey impacting one of our coordinators who handles our financials), we unfortunately will be unlikely to deliver the books on time, at least for JK's birthday. We will try our best to make the donations on time, and that both books arrive before RM's birthday. We will include proof of donation and delivery in the final update posts. We're very sorry for the inconvenience. 

If you are able to help with upcoming projects, we are always looking for volunteers. We have been short-staffed as of late, so all help is greatly appreciated. Please send us a PM or email (armysunite@hotmail.com) and please indicate the number of hours available per week you'd be able to help, so we can plan timelines better. 

&amp;nbsp;


Coming up next is Jimin's birthday (October 13). We will likely open submissions for 2-3 weeks during September and we will continue with the normal fan letters and fan art that has been done for each birthday so far. We'd like to have your thoughts on what the theme of the project should be. So far we have come up with the following ideas. If you think of another idea, please suggest it in the comments below. All feedback is appreciated.

- memories: as Jimin is the de-facto archivist of BTS and shares a lot of BTS with us, we thought about sharing our favourite memories of Jimin, BTS and in general
- self care: as Jimin works very hard and always gives his best to ARMYs, we thought of sending some love back in the form of inspirational messages and self care routines (relaxation routines, favourite comfort food etc.)

What do you guys think?

Please note that the ideas above are not final and are subject to change. We'd welcome any comments or suggestions with regards to ideas for the projects :) 

&amp;nbsp;

Like with our past projects, we will be looking for a charity to pair with this project. Since we can't all travel and/or coordinate an international care package, we are strictly going to do a monetary donation. We'd welcome any suggestions as to which charity you guys would like to contribute to for Jimin's birthday. The charity can be international, and not just strictly Korean, just as long as they relate to interests the boys have. For the sake of convenience, we ask that PayPal be one of the available options for donating. Please reply to each respective comment down below to suggest ideas for each project. Please note that donating is not mandatory for participating in the project; as with all the projects, the coordinators will cover all costs if necessary so as many people can participate as possible.

&amp;nbsp; 

The Secret Santa will be going live sometime in September! Please watch out for that. 

&amp;nbsp; 

As always, thank you for being so supportive and we look forward with working with you guys on projects in the future.
 
Sincerely,
The BTS Projects Team",2,71,False,self,,,,,
