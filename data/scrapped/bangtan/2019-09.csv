2015 = 0.85M

2016 [+1.46M] = 2.31M

2017 [+2.72M] = 5.03M

2018 [+5.15M] = 10.18M


2019 so far added 5.2M as of July (3.5M from Persona, 1.7M from old albums). Assuming Shadow continues the tradition of becoming bigger than the previous album (see Tear/Answer), we may see something like 4M for Shadow and another 1M from other albums till year-end. So their total by end of 2019 could be:


2019 [+10.32M] = 20.5M


Where'll they go from here? At one point, they will have to enlist for the millitary and comebacks will be less frequent. 
Maybe, just may be it's safe to say that 50M is achievable? Idk.

Maybe JK x Justin Beiber will be one of them?? I personally think that there's a chance of there being solos in the next album bc 1) Namjoon said that the other members have asked him to help out on their songs and 2) so that they have new solos to perform in the MOTS Tour next year. But if they release MOTS: Ego before the tour, then Ego might have the new solos similar to LY: Answer so idk.

I just love speculating and if this is could happen, what features would you want on the solos? I think Hobi G would be one, JK and Justin, but RM x ????, Yoongi X ????, Tae x ???? (someone said Jorja Smith and honestly, that sounds lit), Jimin x ????, Jin x ?????. 

And where would Khalid fit into this? Honestly, I don't know if Khalid's voice/style would work in a title track so I think he could be a feature. But with who? Tae? Yoongi? Jimin? Jin? Namjoon?",146,34,False,self,,,,,

(Discussion),https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/cyav0o/how_do_you_feel_about_the_hints_for_mots_shadow/,Elmariajin,1567349508,"I've been thinking about it and reading up theories about Shadow. After Hoseok posted himself listening to wings on weverse I get the feeling Shadow is going to make references to wings. (like Persona and SLA did). 

However, I'm hoping for more sub-unit songs like Jamais Vu. Jamais Vu is a really underrated masterpeice. The new speculation about Hobi-Becky G sounds exciting, i would also be glad if its for Hope World2. I however am not too excited for this supposed Justin Bieber collab. I've been a belieber and Justin is like a ex I want to avoid, I understand the collab could be great, Justin has a good influence on the GP with his remix/collabs. I would however really want to see sub units or solos on the Shadow/Power/Umbra hints (from MAMA VCR). 

I'm positive the concepts and songs for Shadow must be nearly ready by now. While watching memories of 2018, I noticed BTS discussing the SY tour setlist in Japan during Hobi's birthday.  Things are planned out so much in advanced, I think they must be writing ego now so these collabs can't be for Shadow. What do fellow ARMYs feel about Shadow?",19,39,False,self,,,,,

I love every single one of the Bangtan boys but I do have my biases and JK was never one of them - until I heard him sing the song. 

Sooo... I listened to it a lot and I did some research and now I am just curious what you think it could mean? 

So here is my theory:
I know that a lot of ppl on other platforms say that JK is singing about himself because of the smile in the screen and the Youre good at everything, youre perfect-part. 
But I dont know, I feel differently. First of all he is singing at some point You dont like me like that and I get from that that he is not liked back. Also I feel like he wants to be the declacomaine for the other person so they can transfer their dreams into him or because he wants to change to be exactly what the other person needs. 
Of course I have a ship in mind and OF COURSE my fears (if you can call it a fear) are triggered and I havent been able to get it out of my mind. It happened the first time I watched videos about the ship, it happens every time I listen to certain songs and it is in general a sensitive topic for me. Also I tend to feel other people, not just know them. And I kind of feel so much pain for this whole situation. But I am just not sure about the song and how / if it fits anywhere in there.

I am not going to disclose who the other person I am talking about is (though most people will know who I mean), please dont come for me if you have any problem with that. I am just trying to share what has been on my mind

In my opinion:

**Jin**: attraction park reviewer. He would visit attraction parks being his friendly self, talking to strangers, trying food (shoutout to Eat Jin), buying souvenirs and of course getting on the rides and screaming his lungs out. Alternative: comedy skits channel.

**Yoongi**: music equipment reviewer and talking about music and production in general sounds like the obvious thing, but I can also picture him with some DIY How to fix stuff channel, in which he would start full of confidence, mess up a little in the middle but finally manage to fix/install whatever it was. 

**Hobi**: kind of Hope On The Street, but he would start dancing in (slightly) crowded places and see how many people he can convince to join him and dance with him. Sort of spreading the happiness through dancing and injecting some sunshine in people's routinary days. 

**Namjoon**: tourist guide on bike. He would go around cities riding his bike and showing cool, not very popular places, like little museums and parks, and tell you about its history or some interesting stories.

**Jimin**: dance teaching channel, but instead of being on his own he would teach kids and/or elders simple choreographies with some classical moves and techniques. With how caring and attentive he is he would be able to do that without ending the episodes with some injured kid or grandma.

**Tae**: maybe something similar to Joon (minus the bike), but with a much more bohemian twist, mostly visiting art and photography galleries, and chatting with artists/photographers about their work.

**Kook**: sports channel. Every episode he would try a different sport, first learning about it with someone who plays it and then trying it for himself and telling the viewers his experience and how fun it is. 

I'd love to know your ideas, so what do you imagine for their Youtube careers?",55,108,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I have a question regarding the Speak Yourself Final in Seoul and am unable to find the right thread under the Tour redux, hence I'm posting here please do take this down or redirect me to the correct thread if I'm doing this wrong. 

I've noticed on Twitter that there are people offering 'helper' services to secure pre-sale tickets for the SY Final in Seoul for the fanclub pre-sales, however, given the new system where verification is needed and only 2 tickets at a time can be secured, I'm not sure how this would work, or if it's even allowed? 

I'm asking because I have official 6th ARMY fanclub membership but it makes me really frustrated to know that there are still people trying to find ways to cheat the system and secure pre-sale tickets without an official membership, and then re-selling them at exhorbitant prices. It only makes the measures in place redundant if scalpers can still get past the system in this manner. Is this even allowed, or will such tickets be forfeited?",7,15,False,self,,,,,

Or have you guys seen [this tragic event](https://www.knetizen.com/bts-fans-drop-their-drinks-cup-indiscriminately-on-the-street/) by a chance? 
And wondered while some of us trying to clean the enviroment from plastic trashes for birthday, is it necessary to make another trash for a birthday?

I though how about we make a eco friendly day for Namjoon birthday. Atleast we can recommend birthday project organisers(free drink) ask people bring their own muggle so that we won't produce trash &amp; worry about where it will land. 
I wanna collect ideas from you guys &amp; would love to make it done together.

Here's my idea of the ""rules"" we follow on the day

1. Avoid creating unnecessary plastic trash (Use muggle/thermo water bottle instead of plastic cups with straws)
2. Make donation related to enviroment cleaning
3. Share our know-how to each other

What we need is,
1. # idea. Maybe #EcofriendlydayforNamjoon? 
2. A poster with the ""rules"" or our tips
3. If we can find professional people, we can make #Ask_ &amp; let people know anything they want to know about tips &amp; some myths about living eco friendly that we misunderstood. Also we can share our tips to each other under the hashtag #EcofriendlydayforNamjoon

I wanted to post this question here because I'm seeing conflicting information online. I know on Weply and Interpark it says that your name on your ticket has to match exactly as the name on your identification. For example, if your passport says Jane Marie Doe, you must have the MARIE in your Army Membership Card and on your Interpark ticket. If it doesn't match exactly, you may not get into the venue.

I've mostly just seen people online getting anxious about it without any knowledge of this happening previously to international ARMYs at shows. I saw that at Muster, people were turned away because the name on their ticket was different than that on their ID, but this was mostly to kids and their parents that purchased the tickets.

Just wondering if anyone has any insight? I contacted both Interpark and Weply and both said to contact the other about the issue, so they're just running in circles. I'm planning on attending the show to pick up my ticket regardless, but want to be prepared if something goes wrong.

I'd love to hear your experiences about this, if you have any. Thank you!",17,14,False,self,,,,,

Weply added a notification that emphasizes they will take action against those who have created multiple fanclub accounts in order to enter events such as ticket raffles multiple times.  

Hello,

This is Weply.

We would like to inform you of some updates to the BTS GLOBAL OFFICIAL FANCLUB ARMY MEMBERSHIP benefits.

To create a concert experience that can be enjoyed by diverse audience, starting September 24, 2019, only one application may be submitted by each individual for BTS GLOBAL OFFICIAL FANCLUB ARMY MEMBERSHIP benefits that are exclusive to the individual, such as concert ticket raffles, early reservation and TV broadcast audience participation.

 Any benefits are subject to cancelation should it be determined that one individual has submitted multiple applications. Repeated attempts to apply multiple times may result in a temporary or permanent limitation of membership benefits. 

This update will apply to newly registered users and users who have purchased their ARMY Membership before September 3, 2019. Any user who wishes to decline these new terms may request a refund of his or her membership by 4:00 p.m., September 16 (Mon.), 2019 to the Weply customer service center. Refunds will begin processing from September 17 (Tues.), 2019 in the order the requests are received. 

 If a user who has already won a ticket in a raffle and made the payment cancels his or her membership for a refund, the winning ticket and reservation will automatically be canceled

We will continue to strive to provide you with the best fan club and concert-going experience we possibly can.

Thank you.

All things for Fans, Weply.",23,34,False,self,,,,,

Which teasers top your list and why? 

My top 3 would be Spring day, Fire, and either BST or Idol.

Spring Day: I get teary-eyed whenever I watch this one... The Acapella style chorus in the beginning really does bring out the feels.

Fire: I remember getting so freaking hyped and thinking to myself ""This gives me SOTY vibes"". The beat hits super hard and Yoongi's cryptic ""I'll forgive you"" upped the anticipation factor even more.

BST: As smooth as it gets. I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when this teaser dropped.

Idol: Was the teaser released before or after Yoongi said Idol is uncharted territory for them musically?

The source of the news is apparently a friend of Hyunbin, and it was then [posted on Pann](https://pann-choa.blogspot.com/2019/09/enter-talk-ah-fcking-sad-kim-hyunbin.html)

There has been no official confirmation or statement issued yet but I think most of us can surmise its likely Source will focus on only producing GGs for BigHit.

Personally, I am heartbroken for Hyunbin. He is so young and talented, and a big BTS fan to boot. I really thought BigHit would have taken interest in him after his performance of NMD and especially when Zico praised him for Move. He is exactly their type of trainee and he is only 17. However, if they have no intentions to debut a new boy group anytime soon, then perhaps the right move was to let all the male trainees seek out new agencies.",1,1,False,self,,,,,
133,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2019-9-4,2019,9,4,11,czehnm,self.bangtan,TL;DR: Im pretty sure I totally blew it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/czehnm/tldr_im_pretty_sure_i_totally_blew_it/,elleblock,1567562601,"I suppose I'm mostly writing this because I need to get it out of my system before it utterly destroys me. Honestly,I feel like I'm just waiting for the complete and total mental breakdown to come. OH, IT'S COMING! But for now, here is my sad story. Apologies in advance for run on sentences, over/improper use of elipses, and over all shitty grammar. And sorry for swearing. 

I don't recall ever having won anything in my life. Contest, competitions, anything at all. 

But I won raffle tickets for October 29th from the first drawing.

I was fucking elated. SO HAPPY! I figured there was no shot, but also nothing to lose by signing up, and then I won. Dying with happiness. 

Like a sane person, I read the instructions, and saw that there was a time before I needed to register. Ok. I've got this. I have ONE JOB. Follow the instructions. Don't fuck this up. 

......sigh.

Immediately after I won (same night), my best friend/soulmate splits with her husband and comes to stay with me and my boyfriend for a few weeks. Which is great! That came out wrong. I'm sorry for the end of their relationship, but selfishly I loved having my best friend live with me. We would commute home together after work, talk about life and relationships until, ultimately, she passed out on my couch every night. We grew up together, and getting to see her every day and have her basically living with me was honestly wonderful.

 I mention this because this was a life event that took up a great portion of attention span.

Two days after I won, my boyfriend (we live together, 4 years together, he is my future) gets a phone call from his mom. His dad had a freak accident at home, damaged his C-3 vertibrae and is paralyzed. Shocked doesn't come close to the feeling when she told him the news. His father is 67, the most physically fit man I know of any age, and is absolutely the pillar of his family. We are now almost a month into his recovery, and thankfully (as if this past Sunday) he's starting to regain sensation (pins and needles) in his extremities and is making great improvements. AMAZING news!! It's been an extremely difficult month for my bf and his family (who are salt of the earth people. Just remarkably wonderful), and what can you do as the girlfriend of the son going through the agony and uncertainty of a father with a spinal injury but just be there and be supportive. 

I mention this because this was a life event that took up a great portion of my attention span. 


.....I knew there were multiple sets of dates, and most of them are presented as spans of time. ""From Date X to Date Y, do this.""
There's the dates of the next raffle drawing, there's the dates when you can change your name so that it's accurate as far as middle names etc, there's the dates for the registration, there's dates for reserving tickets, there's dates for membership cards... 

...There's a lot of dates. 

And I fucked them up. 

It was not until yesterday afternoon, while my only fellow ARMY friend (yea girl, I'm still dying) was over at my apt so we could organize our trip to Korea cause OH MY GOD WE'RE GOING TO SEE BTS IN KOREA, that I realized that I was supposed to register on interpark between AUGUST 14-19, NOT SEPTEMBER THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SEPTEMBER WHYYYYYYY DID I THINK I HAD UNTIL SOME TIME IN SEPTEMBER WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME OH GODDDDDDDDDDDD HOW COULD I SCREW THIS UP SO BADLY. 

... 

I'd been having this feeling through most of August anytime anyone asks how I am.. ""well, I mean... The two most important people in my life outside of my family are  through really awful times and struggles and I feel terrible for them.. But honestly I'm doing pretty well."" Ughhhh, I should have known better.

That feeling when you get bad news and all of your insides drop down to your toes, and you're suddenly burning up and freezing and sweating and nauseous and you want to scream and cry and you're so overwhelmed all at once? Yes. Yes yes yes.

I went into Weply, did the Customer Care, one-on-one support thing. Tried to briefly explain in 500 characters that I made a mistake in understanding the reservation process (considered lying, but honestly, I fucked up. Me, I did that. No one else, this was entirely my fault. If I'm going to beg for mercy, I will take full responsibility while doing so), attached two screen shots confirming that I had won and what date I won for, and now I am sitting here in hellish purgatory ""Waiting for Feedback."" I am trying desperately to hold on to any slim chance, any glimmer of (J-)hope that Weply, Weverse, Interpark, Bighit, ANYONE AT ALL, will take pity on me and help me fix this. There is an extremely short list of things I wouldn't do to get a second chance. 

I've felt utterly distraught ever since. I cannot believe I did this. On top of everything else, I just feel guilty. How could I have blown this opportunity that SO MANY ARMY WOULD KILL TO HAVE HAD!?!?! I think that's the worst part of all of this. I'm so sorry. Truly. If you didn't win the raffle, and you're reading this, I am so incredibly sorry. Obviously I didn't deserve the opportunity I was granted, and I'm so sorry I took it away from you.



TL;DR: I won the raffle for the final day of Love Yourself Speak Yourself in Seoul, and I missed the reservation date through Interpark. 

Reddit ARMY, if you've gotten this far, do you have any advice? Is there anyone else I should be reaching out to? Is there anything I can do? Do I stand a chance? Should I continue to hold out (J-)hope? Any advice (or support) will be valued to the highest and extremely appreciated.

Khalid/H.E.R. + OT7

I tried DaebakCast and listened to their review of the tear album but couldn't finish cos they were saying that they don't enjoy the music as much because bts are being too Americanized and that the fake love mv was boring... after I heard that I exited lol.

Basically the course covers BTS and their global impact. It analyzes their various speeches, the factors of their international success, and encourages you to think critically about the impact of international music in a globalized world.

During the semester the course also goes over the bangtan universe, the groups history, philanthropy, etc.

Ive been a bts fan for a really long time, and seeing something like this at my university was just, amazing. Personally I find it incredible that we can recognize their true impact in a mature and educational setting.

So, right now they are on a 7 - 8 week vacation. They will most likely get back to work the week of September 29th to prep for their final concert dates.

Now, Im going to operate under the assumption that the recording for the next album is essentially done. In the can, getting mastered as we speak. But they probably havent started any of the album photo shoots or rehearsals for new choreography or filmed a video.

They could probably squeeze in photo shoots between October concert dates, but I just cant imagine them really getting into choreography and full on rehearsals until the last week of October.

With that said, weve got looming end of the year award shows in Korea and America. Im assuming they will Hit all the biggies: AMAS, MAMA and Melon. And they need to prep for those elaborate performances.  With all that, Im still having a hard time seeing them do that AND film and release a video.

Basically, if they follow their typical patterns, it would be very difficult to have a comeback back around awards season.

BUT, what if they approached their next comeback differently? Instead of the typical Korean style where they drop everything all at once: video, single, full album, they do something different?

In the West, the usual pattern is to drop a couple of singles first before releasing the full album. Often releasing a lyric video or just an audio clip. Send it to all the streaming services, iTunes, to radio. And quite often, the artist would perform them on shows ahead of any album release.

What would you think if BTS did that. Release a song or two first, perform them on award shows before any music video or album release?

Then early next year, drop the full album?",72,31,False,self,,,,,

It seems weird that I put on music to help with sensory overload related to sound but something about the smoothness of the music helps. Especially Tae's voice. 

Often times I feel quite weird by this development with anxiety and I was just wondering if any ARMYs here have dealt with sensory overload or bad anxiety and used music as a tool for help.

2) gave her more respect for them
i made a deal and said that ill watch chasing happiness if she watches a bts video/documentary.

i want to make sure she has a really good first impression of them, but im not sure what to choose. ive watched burn the stage and ive watched some of the really popular who is bts videos and they arent quite what im looking for. burn the stage was too focused on the actual concerts (which was the point of it to begin with) and the who is bts videos are too focused on the facts about them.

Hello everyone! I am a 9th grade English teacher. Recently I learned a couple of my students like BTS and it inspired me to add some BTS decorations to my classroom! I want to make it subtle though. Maybe quotes that I can hang up that can relate to other students (not just ARMY!) 

Does anyone have any good quotes that would work? Im looking for motivational ones. I am thinking of a couple but its hard to do it alone. 

Any other suggestions for classroom stuff/teaching would be GREAT :D

USA buyers preferred. PM if interested and ready to pay. Paypal only.

If intl buyer, expect ~$40 more in price due to high shipping fee+intl paypal fees. I prefer to sell to USA army at this time due to convienence and faster delivery time. 


Please do research before buying signed albums, do not ask me questions where I got my albums; they are all from korea and usually signed albums are given away to acquiantances or connections or event then sold later online such as ebay listings (ex of legit signed album seller is mojasajo). I check pen pressure, consistency of members' signs for the era, references to other legit signed albums, presence of not for sale or  (there are legit c1 copies and albums without komca sticker also) etc. I am an avid collector of BTS goods, I own signed albums as well and have other fellow signed album collectors check the albums before I put them up for sale.",3,16,False,self,,,,,

Ngl, it hurts to see that. I hope we can change that perception by being less aggressive towards locals/non-fans (especially when they say they don't like BTS/Kpop without attacking the boys). Let's respect their opinion. If you want them to check out the boys and change our image, politely tell them about the Love Myself and anti-bullying campaign, the donations made by both ARMYs and BTS, and the birthday projects (animal adoption, tree planting, clean up drive.) Do not spam them with fancams or force them to like our boys.

For antis, I still don't know how to handle this in a way that it won't backlash to the boys at the same time, teach the haters a lesson. But base on most people's advices, it's best to just ignore them. Let's not stoop down to their level. I admit, I did before due to intense anger, but it only tarnishes our name and it links back to the boys.

Sigh.....I don't even know how to start. I don't know a lot of things lately. Lately, i've started to feel so depressed. I've been depressed before but it stopped and came back and its different this time. I'm really scared about what I would do and I'm scared about so many other things. I'm failing some classes in college that I can't afford to be failing because if I do, then I won't be on track to graduate. At home, my mom isn't as mean to me as she was a couple of years ago but I feel so suffocated there and I feel like crying all the time. I haven't been getting any sleep and honestly,....honestly, sometimes I just wish I would disappear from this world. The only thing that would help me when I was in this state a few years ago was BTS. Listening to their music and their voices seemed to make everything better but recently, I don't feel any consolation. I just feel so empty inside. The emptiness feels like nothing but it hurts so bad. I try to enter the Magic Shop in my head but I can't seem to access it at the moment. The worst part of this all is that I have absolutely no one I can tell. My mom wouldn't care, I don't want to burden my siblings about something they won't understand, and all of my friends don't know this side of me. I'm always the happy one, the funny one. But nobody knows how truly broken I am on the inside. I'm so poised and well mannered on the outside but on the inside, I'm screaming,begging for help just to have no one hear me. I never tell my friends because although they are good friends to me, I don't think I would trust them enough to be vulnerable around them. It seems like I have a lot of trouble with trust. I just really, really, really, really wish there was someone I could talk to at anytime. Someone who understands and would just listen. Someone who would tell me everything was gonna be alright. Someone I can just be myself around. But I have no one. Last night, I finished a K-Drama series called Tempted. It was about a group if friends who were so close to each other to the point where they knew every tiny detail about each other. More than that, they were there for each other for every bad and good moment that happened to each other. But towards the end, their friendship falls apart and although it was a somewhat happy ending, I felt myself become so sad. The part that hurt me the most was the fact that they were never going to be friends the way they used to be. And I hated the fact that friends could do something as horrible as what they did to their best friend. How they could just break his heart over and over again without a hint of regret or guilt. It was just a show but it reminded me of the relationship I wish I had and the whole reason why I have trust issues in the first place. No matter what you really can't trust anyone even your friends. And the part that tears my heart even more? I always feel like I can never get to close to someone because no matter what, when we grow up, we all move away from each other. I just feel like I'm suffering alone and I just wish this pain would stop. Its to the point where I want to be physically hurt just so I won't feel this pain anymore. I wish my mom would hit me instead of hurting my heart. But I must endure this pain because this is what I wished for. This is what I wanted. Whenever I'm sad or depressed for no reason, I always feel like I shouldn't be. There are people in the world who have it far worse than me so why do I feel this way. So I asked God for a reason to be sad. And I guess now I'm getting them. Bad grades, no sleep, criticizing parents, no close friends. I guess my prayers were answered and there is nothing I should complain about. Now I have multiple reasons to feel sad. Please God, if you're listening, can I ask for one more favor? I ask that you don't let any of my siblings ever feel this pain and if they do (or are right now) please help them. I've already accepted that my happiness doesn't matter when it comes to the good of our family. I have to get a good paying job and protect the reputation of our family. But I just wish someone cared about me. I wish I didn't have to pretend I was ok every time. My heart feels like it's being torn into pieces sometimes. When I have to tell someone, ""Oh I'm just tired"" or ""My eyes just water sometimes"" I feel like my heart is going to explode into a million pieces. I'm just so tired. Sorry for the long post. I just had no one to turn to..",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Here to talk about the two birthday projects we are doing for our beloved leader, Namjoon!

Firstly, continuing on with what we started with JK's birthday, we are doing the flash 48 hour donations for One Tree Planted as well continuing to encourage people to submit their environmentally friendly activities to our form and help create a map of all the environmental actions that ARMY have taken. 

Link to the fundraiser and map here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1171442531042652167](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1171442531042652167)

Secondly, our month long birthday project for Namjoon!! ARMY voted for environmental causes to focus on for his birthday, so for September, we are doing #BuildBricksWithNamjoon. We are working with Hug it Forward, an organization that encourages education through building classrooms out of eco-bricks in Latin America. Throughout the process of building the classrooms, they bring communities together around creating a more environmentally conscious space for the future!

Full thread with directions to donate here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1168532602892013572](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1168532602892013572)

Our side project for the month is encouraging ARMY to reuse and upcycle items that would be thrown away to lower the amount of waste we are creating. 

More details on that here: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1168533458630696960](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1168533458630696960)

Lastly, BTS ARMY is now the highest ranked team on Freerice. Ya'll have helped collect more than 9 million grains of rice to help combat world hunger!!!  Give yourselves a huge round of applause!",0,55,False,self,,,,,

How I got my information- I am korean, and I asked my grandmother

When is  celebrated)  is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar on the full moon. ( So look outside, the moon should be beautiful). 

What do we do during ? People typically return to their hometowns so there should be a lot of traffic in Korea right now, but I live in the US and cannot partake in this part because plane tickets are expensive. We would also visit the resting place of ancestors and bow and honor them. I cannot take part in this either because my ancestors are buried 60 miles away. The typical food that is made specifically for this holiday would be  (songpyeon) which are half-moon rice cakes filled with sweet beans or seasame and honey. Other traditional foods are eaten, but this would be the main one. My grandma and I made these the today and they are delicious!!! Women will also perform a special full moon dance and sing under the full moon. The full moon also represents hope, so we will be facing the moon and praying tonight. Korean traditional games might be played during the daytime. Gifts will be exchanged (I got a new hanbok  {traditional korean dress} this year). 

I think that I didn't leave anything out, so if you have more specific questions, please let me know! I imagine that our boys had a good chuseok  () with their families.

Sometimes this is ""Full length"" versions with an extra verse/bridge, but often this is completely different versions with new production. 

Do you prefer the originals? is there one alternate version that stands out as excellent? are there some tracks that you regularly listen to multiple versions of?

For me, i usually prefer the originals, but i could listen to all three versions of Run and not be annoyed that I'm listening to the ""wrong"" one. I also can't listen to the original of Mic Drop, because the Steve Aoki mix is considerably better (not the version with Desiigner), and i like listening to the Rock version of Fake Love every now and then as a bit of a palate cleanser",79,115,False,self,,,,,

YouTube recommended a video of a priest reacting to a BTS MV. And thats when it all started. Since then Ive watch countless hours of content. 


**BTS is the most wholesome** band Ive ever had the chance to discover and Im so grateful for it. 



Even though Im in my late 20s some of their outlooks on life have been eye opening for me. The way they resolve issues within the band, how they deal with pressure, their dedication and their openness about all of it is inspiring and heartwarming. 
Theres a quote form one of Jimins interview that has stuck with me (Ill find the clip again) where he talks about the importance of enjoying what youre doing instead of asking why youre doing it. Something clicked at that moment. 



Since then Ive been devouring BTS content. **What is your must watch list? Are there interviews or Run BTS essential episodes?**



*What Ive seen so far:
- Bring the soul docu series
- Burn the stage docu series
- 2019 Festa 
- 2019 Summer package 
- Some RUN BTS / Yoongi BDY, Billboard &amp;amp; more
- Tons of performances* 


Thx!

Deciding what kind of look she wanted to represent herself and the reasoning behind her choices. 

That got me wishing that Big Hit did a special on all the creative team behind BTS. Considering they put SO much work in creating and overarching story and a Bangtan Universe, they probably put an equal amount of effort in the visuals to express each era.

From hair, makeup, outfits, set design for videos, album photo shoots. It must be an elaborate process. Like literally thousands of hours of work before our boys even set foot on a set.

To give an example, has anyone seen the documentary The First Monday in May which documents the entire process of creating the Met Ball. Not just the party but developing the exhibition to represent the chosen theme.

Had Big Hit ever done anything like that? If yes, can you link some clips?

If not, Big Hit! Please put something together like this. Were at the beginning of the Map of the Soul era. I want to see how your creative team is bringing the theme to life. And the reason behind every choice.

Would anyone else like something like that? 

P.S. Im suddenly picturing the Big Hit intern getting stressed at the thought of doing this.",8,42,False,self,,,,,

i often go to so far away for comfort - both versions - and i found that promise and paradise are good songs to turn to as well. i'm not really looking for something upbeat and hype, but not something that's too wallow-y either. just... warm, loving, comforting. it doesn't have to be all rose-colored, i mean, so far away is pretty bittersweet.

by the way, sorry if this goes against any of the policies - i read through them, but i'm still wary of violating anything. i'm sorry in advance if there's any issue!

The boys have different level of skill and even within the same skill level, they have different strengths and groove, quite apparent if you focus on each member individually but they always come together to put on a show that looks best as a unit. Although all members do get to shine individually at some point too (Jin's head banging in Dionysus is like no other and I won't accept criticism whilst solo V in DNA is a god) but focus on a unit means there are often moments that go underrated or unnoticed for members individually.

So I was wondering what are some dance or performance moments for each member that you love and would like to highlight.

Some of my favourites are :

* Namjin in the intro to Airplane pt2. MAMA. This song doesn't get much love on this sub so this performance also doesn't get talked about (MMA IDOL takes the spotlight) but I LOVE THE ENTIRE intro. However, NamJin in the intro part look so powerful. I was new in the fandom so didn't know that the reason they didn't do proper dancing was because they are the 'wings', I just assumed what they did was their concept but I specifically thought DAMN THEY LOOK LIKE SUCH STARS! Both just looked so manly and rich ahaha.
* Hobi in Rainism. Rainism is JK's song hands down! Again one of the first videos I saw and being very impressed by JK but multiple watches later you see Hobi to his left just casually SLAYING the choreo and looking so HOT while doing it.
* JK in Jikook's performance of Adult Ceremony. Now I don't know if this is underrated but they both perform well as a unit always so they both probably got equal amount of love but I wanna highlight JK. I remember Son Songdesuk saying JK's strength is that he is very good at basics and you can really see that in this song. He goes real deep for each step but still makes it look very effortless probably because he isn't adding too much flair?",41,75,False,self,,,,,

I want to ask advice about going to a BTS concert.,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/d50q20/has_everyone_gotten_their_seats_for_the_sy_final/,kagamiis97,1568640800,"Sorry if this isn't allowed, but I just checked my Interpark and I found out I'm seating in the Floor Side ""R03"" section row thirteen apparently. Since I've never been to a concert for BTS before, I cannot visualise how large the stadium will be and how close that is to the stage (I mean I think it's quite close). I'm wondering how good the visibility is especially since it will be seated, though I'm assuming everyone stands anyway? I'm sure regardless it will be an amazing experience, but since I'm going by myself since my boyfriend cannot join me as he isn't ARMY member and he didn't want to seat in the 2nd/3rd floors by himself lol.

If you've ever been to a BTS concert, what should I prepare for, like how early should I arrive, merchandise, what to bring in a bag etc. I'm also considering wearing platform sneakers, but I also feel a little guilty because I'm already quite tall compared to Asian standards (171cm) so I don't want to block anyone but I also want to see the stage lol...would it be rude of me to do so? I know some Korean girls wore platforms at Muster...",19,27,False,self,,,,,

I wanted to get tickets for Seoul Final LY: SY tour and failed miserably in the raffles. So I decided my luck to try for early reservations. But right now,  I'm kinda stumped as to how we are meant to verify our ARMY memberships against Interpark \[Global\]? Is there meant to be a specific page? 

I got all my details ready via Weply- they shared an announcement and I clicked the link and everything was there. Was that the verification process or am I missing something? I've reread the Concert details posted on Weverse/ Weply like 2 times now and I feel like I'm not understanding something or at least missing out.... 

Has anyone been successful in verifying their memberships yet?

Any help / advice would be appreciated, Thank you!

I took a picture and numbered them 1-4 across the top row, 5-7 across the bottom. Can you tell me which can is which member of the band?

I've done some research and found that these are (I think) the phrases)

1. Run like yourself
2. Im fine if its you
3. Your spring day is today
4. Go instead of worry
5. You are my idol
6. This year is blazing fire
7. Youre really dope

3, 6 and 7 are my best guesses based on Google Translate but if I got any of them wrong I'd love to know that as well.

Im thinking
Jan- March ; Grammys, Brits etc + Japan single

April; comeback 

May- August; Map of the Soul Stadium tour; it will probably be much bigger than Speak Yourself 

Late August; comeback 

September Live Aid

October; Break

Nov-Dec year end stuff + Japan fanmeets

I have pointed out that fans of other pursuits such as sports are also loud  and often more obnoxious and rude. I have said things to the effect that criticizing the screaming is a means of dismissing ARMY on the basis of the gender.

I still agree with what Ive said, and with similar things that other people have said. 

But  I need to get real. The screaming really bothers me. Objectively, it hurts my ears! Ive tried to get used to it when I listen to live footage on youtube, etc., but I just cant.  It is one of many reasons why I probably wont ever attend a live concert.  If I cant handle recorded high-pitched sounds, I'm not sure I'd be able to handle them live.

Im a very new fan and am unfamiliar with kpop in general. I know that the boys (especially Namjoon) are involved in the writing and production of their music, but I was curious as to how much control they have over other aspects of the group. 

Jins hair escapades aside, do they get to choose their own hairstyle/color? Are their outfits always styled for Run episodes, airport appearances, and other filmed appearances? Do they get to pick their stage outfit concepts? 

Do you think they have any social media requirements? Are they told when/ what to post on Twitter, VLive, etc., or is that entirely up to them? I saw some assumptions earlier that the recent Twitter posts may have been a move to distract the audience away from the JK dating drama which got me wondering just how calculated all of these decisions potentially are. 

Do they have any restrictions as far as personal projects given that it may reflect upon their image within BTS? I know that Yoongi produced his mixtape entirely on his own, but I was still a little shocked to hear it after getting used to BTS rather pg-13 branding (although idk how BigHit reconciles asking the boys not to swear while also choreographing some of the sexiest pelvic thrusts/hip rolls in the game?!)

I would be super interested in seeing a copy of their contracts, but I figure that will probably never happen haha, but yalls insight is the next best thing! 

P.S. Ive watched *almost* all of the usual recs for new fans, so if anyone has any favorite performances, interviews, etc., that dont usually get talked about, I would love to hear about them!",122,88,False,self,,,,,

*To Jin, Suga, Rap Monster, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook,*

*When I first met you, all of you were so young. I met you all at different times, but all of you seemed to be scared about something. Like you didn't know how to look at me. You couldn't look me in the eye well at all.*

*I feel that I really pushed you boys a lot. I had a lot of greed and put you under my standard. I gave you a hard time asking why you couldn't believe in yourself. And why you weren't trying to look far into the future. I'm sure all of you remember losing sleep over this.*

*Because the place I pointed to was too far and dark. Even so, you always somehow found that path, you always shot up higher. And further up than the place that I pointed to.*

*As I was walking with you, I finally realized it. Your anxiety was another face of desperation, that's what pushed you to practice until late at night. To go against everything, going over the limits on your own. But now I step back, I can see you getting better and better. Because there's no reason for me to raise my finger and points it towards a place. With your own strengths, you are finding your own paths. And you are passing the places that I didn't dare looking to towards.*

*But still, thank you. I won't say that I'm proud of you just yet. Because I am a very greedy person. Let's hold onto that until the day you become the best group in the world.*

*On June 12 a year. 3 years later, on that day, I'll look each of you in the eye and tell you personally from my lips that I'm thankful that you stayed by me and for bringing me here and allowing me to dream.*

 *I write this on May 2016, a month before your 3rd Anniversarry.* 

 *- Bang Si Hyuk* 

&amp;#x200B;

Was watching the Bon Voyage series for the first time after hearing about the New Zealand trip and came across this which made me a little emotional... thought i'd share it for those that haven't seen it.

 If this was truly written in 2016 then i'm honestly flabbergasted at the sheer vision and trust between Bang Si Hyuk and BTS. They believed in each other to their core, and I know we ARMY were already aware of this but seeing it in writing like this blew me away... and then their's the fact that it became a reality...",35,393,False,self,,,,,

The Personais how we choose to present ourselves to the world. The Persona represents all of the different social masks that we wear or roles that we play among various groups and situations in order to fit in with society's expectations and norms and other people's expectations . It's not something inherently negative but a way that allows people to adapt to the world around them. And the plot of Singing in the Rain is generally about masking something behind the scenes as something else to appeal to an audience , to certain people while not expressing/showing the whole truth . 

According to Jung , the Shadow archetype on the other hand exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. The shadow forms out of our attempts to adapt to cultural norms and expectations and the expectations of people around us. It is this archetype that contains all of the things that are unacceptable not only to society, but also to one's own personal morals and values. This archetype is often described as the darker side of the psyche, representing wildness, chaos, and the unknown.

 I personally think the movie Black Swan fits the Shadow Theme a lot! A young ballerina tormented with having to face her repressed and darker side after many years of trying to fit into her mother's expectations and what she thought was expected of her for being in that field of art/work and that part of her breaking out under horrific circumstances.

What do you think is a good book/movie/play to reference in order to fit the Shadow concept ? And if they do continue with a theatric theme , what form of theatre would Shadow fit best ( like Persona did with Broadway/Musical) in your opinion ?

This is a fun opinion discussion and not a theory discussion about the upcoming album.",26,62,False,self,,,,,

I figured this would be the best place to post this because this is the subreddit where I submit all of my art. (For those of you who don't know, I've drawn Taehyung, Yoongi, and Jungkook so far! )On my most recent post there were some comments that made me feel very upset and unsure how to deal with them, so I don't feel as comfortable posting my art here anymore. I've been the victim of very severe harassment on other platforms so while it sounds like I'm being a baby or chickening out, it's something I'm very sensitive to. Also with my posts gaining a lot of popularity, it's become a lot of pressure to continue to pump out art at least once a week with school.  
I want to say thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has left the most wonderful/amazing comments and supported me! I really didn't expect for any of my projects to blow up this way and it's so awesome! You didn't not get overshadowed by negativity at ALL, so I'm sorry if I made it seem that way D:  
At least for the time being, I will be taking a break from posting my art on this subreddit and will try and come back happier, with better skills, and lots more to show you!

My vacation plans were just finalized and I'll be in Seoul during the 3 SY Final Concert dates! Seeing how I didn't anticipate going to Korea, I didn't buy ARMY membership (and I think it's too late now anyways =/). I read online that if there are still tickets left after the raffle and early reservation period, the time to buy any remaining tickets will start on Thursday, September 26 8 pm KST. I've only had experience buying tickets for the US tour dates of the Speak Yourself tour extension with Ticketmaster (I'm based in California), so I'm trying to get familiarized with the process before Thursday rolls around. So far, what I've found when I search on their reddit pertained to those who had bought membership at various points in time, so I don't know what would be applicable to me.

If there are tickets available for sale on Thursday, would having an account registered on Interpark be all I need to get the tickets? Anyone know how the 3 dates are going to lay out...do I need to aim for one date only or is there a way to see if I can get tickets for whichever date has seats left? Is there anything else I should know about? I understand I have to be careful with the name I put down as it needs to match my passport. I'm totally fine if I'm not able to go since I'm sure so many other ARMYs want in, but if there is a chance, I definitely want to try my hand at getting a ticket, even if it means being up before 4 am my local time to do so!

Actually, in recent years,  much more groups are aiming to Western market for earning money. But they never touched my heart. 
I agree that BTS will drop down in someday and someday most fans may leave and ordinary may forget them. Their popularity wont maintain forever. But they are still my only one idol, my only one role model, only one comfort. I will support and love BTS till the end.

I'm planning to graduate from uni next year (hopefully november 2020, february 2021 at most) and I want to ask for a concert ticket as a graduation gift (probably Paris or London).

Problem is, I don't know anything about their concerts. Like what period of the year they usually are, when and what time the tickets start to sell, where do they actually sell them, what is a membership (I think it has to do with tickets too?) etc.

Would you be so kind to explain what should I know if I want to go to one of their concerts? I know it's a little early to think about it, but given what I read about the speed the tickets sell out, I feel like planning ahead is a smart move

The Grammys are the most prestigious of the lot when it comes to US music awards shows - but they are also massive, labyrinthine and are heavily governed by regulations that can sometimes seem impossible to break down and understand.

I thought that a nice rundown of the basic facts of the Grammys would be extremely helpful to ARMY as they restart the journey through Grammy season. I have been following awards and awards prognostication for over ten years, and have provided Grammy predictions to websites in the past, so I wanted to share my knowledge of the most confusing (and most fun, imo) of all awards shows. I will only be providing FACTUAL information on the structure, rules, and voting procedures of the Grammys in this post - I won't be providing my predictions or my thoughts on BTS' chances, in the interest of keeping this as useful as possible. 

**The Basics**

The Grammys are the most famous and most prominent awards for music in the US - 2019's awards will be the 62nd given out. As far as prestige goes, they are seen by the general public as important markers of musical and cultural success, although, like all awards shows, they have faced valid criticisms. (Over the past decade, the main one has been ""why can't Kendrick Lamar/Beyonce win Album of the Year?"", followed by the [Great Lorde Sexism Scandal of 2017](https://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-lorde-turned-grammy-performance-2230515), but you can find plenty of criticism of Grammy choices throughout the ages [if you look](https://gizmodo.com/20-years-ago-today-milli-vanilli-lost-their-grammy-for-5694574).) Part of the reason that they are still seen as so prestigious despite this is because they are one of the few music awards shows in the US not decided in any way by fan voting. Their website even says that they are ""the only peer-recognized music award"".

The Grammys have a really helpful infographic that outlines who votes for what categories [here](https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy/faq), which also has a lot of fascinating information about how companies submit their albums/artists, what kind of voters can vote for what categories, and what to do if you're a Grammy voter and get locked out of your account. 

There are eighty-four total Grammy categories (!!), but the categories that draw the most attention and competition are what we'll call the Main Four:

* Album of the Year - *Award for outstanding achievement in creating a full album. Given to the producers, performing artists (featured or otherwise), and album engineers responsible for making the album.*
* Record of the Year - *Award for outstanding achievement in recording a song. Given to the producers, performing artists, and engineers on the song. This award does NOT recognize songwriting.*
* Song of the Year - *Award for outstanding achievement in songwriting and composition for a given song. Given to the composers on the song. Record and Song of the Year are frequently confused in media reports.*
* Best New Artist - *Award for an artist who has broken through in a remarkable way during the course of the year, whether artistically, commercially, or status-wise.*

Additionally, there are multiple categories covering genres such as Pop, Rap, Rock/Metal (I know they aren't the same, the Grammys combined them for some weird reason a few years ago), Country, Alternative - we have 84 awards to get through so you can imagine how many genres are covered! Every voter is allowed to vote for the Main Four, as well as up to 15 additional categories that cover their areas of expertise. (To use BTS as an example, they would likely vote for Rap and Pop categories, but probably not Contemporary Christian/Gospel.)

Not every category is presented at the actual Grammys broadcast ceremony. The main four are always presented every year, and because of Pop and Rap's prominence on the charts, you can always expect to see a few of those awards presented during the broadcast ceremony. The categories presented change every year outside of these.

**Timeline**

The timeline for Grammy submission this year can be found [here](https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/mark-your-calendars-key-dates-and-deadlines-62nd-grammy-awards%C2%AE), but we'll go through each level and explain what happens at each portion.

Oct. 1, 2018Aug. 31, 2019: Product Eligibility Period 

* To be considered eligible for the Grammys this year, you would have had to release an album between the above time period. Unlike most awards shows, the Grammys do not award based on a previous calendar year.

June 24July 8, 2019: First-Round Online Entry Process Access Period/July 17Aug. 2, 2019: Final-Round Online Entry Process Access Period 

* These are when recording companies and artists submit their albums and singles for eligibility. There's nothing really super exciting about this process from our end.

Sept. 25Oct. 10, 2019: First-Round Voting 

* Tomorrow, Grammy voters will be able to vote for submitted Grammy nominees for the first time. As mentioned above, all members of the Academy can vote for nominees for the Main Four and up to 15 additional categories; Members of the Academy in specific Craft Committees can vote for categories like Album Notes, Remixed Recording, and the Min Yoongi Honorary Recording Package Award.

Nov. 20, 2019: Nominations Announcement 

* Self-explanatory. The nominations announcement is usually livestreamed by the Grammys; information on this has not yet been released. 

Dec. 9, 2019Jan. 3, 2020: Final-Round Voting 

* Grammy voters select their winners in all categories. Every voter can vote in every category at this point! 

Jan. 26, 2020: 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards Telecast 

* Woo-hoo, it's finally here!! A who's who of US music will come together to perform, schmooze, and present awards to each other. 

**FAQ Time!**

*What kind of albums are eligible for AOTY and Genre album awards?*

Albums that are created entirely of new material during the eligibility period (minus single releases that came before the album's debut) are eligible for album awards. You cannot win a Grammy with a Greatest Hits or a repackage album. Beyond that:

* Albums must be commercially available, either in physical form or on a streaming service that has existed for more than a year (adding albums only available on streaming is new for this year);
* Albums available in digital only must meet certain requirements for labeling contributing artists, songwriters, producers, and engineers in the metadata of the files;
* Albums must either have five tracks totaling at more than 15 minutes, or be more than 30 minutes long (with no track requirement).

*What did BTS submit last year?/How was BTS nominated for Best Recording Package?*

*  *Love Yourself: Tear* was submitted to Album of the Year and Pop Album. (The FYC ad that was revealed today is slightly misleading given this - BTS definitely submitted to AOTY before, but last year's FYC ad did not push for that award.)
* ""Fake Love"" has been submitted to Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Pop Duo/Group Performance, and Music Video. 
* Submitting to any category automatically makes you eligible to be considered for Best Album Notes, Best Recording Package, and Best Immersive Audio (assuming you didn't record your album in mono sound, which... I'm sure someone has done recently as an artistic experiment but is exceedingly rare for commercial material). You do not need to submit to these categories specifically - since BTS submitted and likely sent a nice little package of their pretty albums to the Grammys with their submission last year, they were considered.

*Can you be nominated for an award if you don't submit your album to the Grammys?*

**No.** This is a BIG thing that a lot of fans of all bands tend to miss when discussing Grammy chances for K-pop artists. BTS, to my knowledge, is the ONLY K-pop group that has ever submitted to the Grammys. (YG probably could have actually WON a Grammy if they'd submitted ""Gangnam Style"" back in the day for Short Form Video.) Basically any question about awards eligibility or snubs, past or future, has to be prefaced with, ""did they/will they submit?"" (This question is not super relevant to BTS as a whole anymore, but this question WILL be relevant to discussion of the awards chances of *mono*, *BTS World,* and BLACKPINK in Best New Artist.)

*Can a voter decide to nominate an album/song in a category it wasn't submitted in?*

Also no. If BigHit decides ""Dionysus"" is a rock song and submits it in Best Rock Song, voter Jane Doe can't put ""Dionysus"" on her ballot in Rap/Sung Performance. 

Now wait, you might say, songs often cross many genres! Yes, and that's where playing the strategic game comes in with submissions. Some artists have totally TANKED their chances of being nominated with bad submissions to wrong categories - Ariana Grande was seen as snubbed last year in the Main Four by the general public, but she submitted the less-popular and less-acclaimed ""God is a Woman"" over ""No Tears Left to Cry"", explaining at least one reason for her ""snub"". On the flipside, emo bands who have long moved away from their Rock roots, like Paramore, Panic! At the Disco, and Fall Out Boy, have done very well in the past few years submitting their albums and singles in Rock categories, which are much less hard to break into compared to Pop or Dance categories.

A Grammy committee does check each submission, to ensure no song is submitted to a category that egregiously doesn't define it at all (i.e., they probably would've removed Childish Gambino's ""This is America"" from consideration if it was submitted in Country categories), but there's generally a decent amount of leeway given. (Last year, ""Girls Like You"" by Maroon 5 feat. Cardi B was submitted successfully in Pop, despite the presence of an obvious rap bridge; ""Say Something"", a Country/Pop duet by Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton, also went Pop.)

BTS could easily submit work to Rap and Pop categories, or even World Music. Another artist who will likely be submitting strategically is Billie Eilish, who has become a Pop princess but first rose up in the Alternative scene, and has a very good shot of winning multiple awards if she plays her cards right.

*How do we know what submissions are for artists?*

We wait for a guy on GoldDerby, an awards forum, to leak the information.

I'm not even joking, that's literally how we find these out every year. I know you probably expected something more formal. The Grammys don't ever publish their submissions officially, so that's the best we've got. 

*What the hell is up with Best New Artist?/Why was BTS not nominated for Best New Artist in 2017/2018?/Why was Cardi B/Post Malone/Migos/insert artist here not up for Best New Artist in 2017/2018/now?*

Best New Artist has always been a weird category, but prior to 2017's Ceremony/the Grammy Awards for 2016, anyone who rose to prominence in a given year who had not been previously Grammy-nominated for an album track (singles are fine)/not been part of a band and gone solo could be nominated for BNA, which gave way to bands like fun. winning the award nearly 15 years into their existence. There were many criticisms of this, including *from fun. themselves, who mocked it in their acceptance speech.*

Starting in 2017, new requirements were put in place for Best New Artist. The main ones were:

* BNA eligible artists need more than 5 singles/tracks over the course of their careers, but can have no more than 30 tracks at the time of eligibility.
* BNA eligible artists cannot have more than 3 albums, even taking the above into consideration.

Additionally, there has always been the extra ""fun"" factor of the Grammys having an additional rule about what makes a New Artist:

*  BNA artists ""must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and  impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period.""

A lot of newer artists, BTS, Cardi B, and Migos included, have been automatically disqualified based on the album and track rulings. (BTS had close to 100 tracks at the time they were first submitted and might have been eligible for BNA.) Lady Gaga was famously disqualified from BNA in 2010 because she had been nominated for one single in 2008; Post Malone, who has been brought up as a potential BNA nominee multiple years running, has been disqualified numerous times based on the Academy arguing that his 2016 album *Stoney* was his actual rise to prominence, not 2017's ""Rockstar"", a song that I still hear every time I go shopping. 

That being said, the Grammys will occasionally push their requirements to the limit. Though he was not nominated, Logic was deemed eligible for BNA in 2018, having exactly 30 songs *and* 3 albums to his name, and having his breakthrough year with 1-800-273-8255.

*Can BTS submit more than one song?*

Somewhat.

An example of what BTS CAN submit:

* *Song of the Year:* Boy with Luv
* *Best Pop Duo/Group Performance:* Boy with Luv
* *Best Rap/Sung Performance:* Dionysus

You can submit one song per category, and you cannot submit a song to multiple genres. (i.e., Boy with Luv cannot be both a Pop and a Rap song, for purposes of submission.) You can submit the same song to Record of the Year and Song of the Year simultaneously.

*Can BTS submit something from Answer/Tear?*

An artist can submit material made outside of the eligibility period if:

* They are submitting a Music Video released during the eligibility period for a song that was on a previously submitted album (i.e., if BTS was to make a music video for ""Dionysus"" and release it in November, that video would be eligible for awards).
* They are submitting a single off of an older album that was not previously submitted in ANY category, that was released as a single during the eligibility period. (i.e., Panic! At The Disco submitted ""High Hopes"" last year, so it cannot be nominated this year at all; however, Brendon CAN submit ""Hey Look Ma I Made It"", as it was not submitted last year and released as a single early in 2019.)

Based on these criteria, BTS really doesn't have any material that is eligible for this period for them to submit.

*I have another random technical question about the Grammys!*

Let's hear them! I'd love to help out however I can. Hopefully this little guide elucidated some things for all y'all. Tomorrow we might get some submission news, so let's keep our fingers crossed and root for Bangtan!",83,339,False,self,,,,,

However, even with the material that I dislike, there still tends to be one small aspect which I do like about it. It could be the lyrics, production, choreography, or styling for a particular era for example. Here's my list:

 * I think that Persona is arguably the most cohesive sounding OT7 album that they've released, and it would be inarguable if the intro (I genuinely love everything about this song so much) and Dionysus was replaced. An intro with a vibe similar to Trivia: Love would have been great for Joon.
* I love Hobi's verse in Boy In Luv, it's the only part of the song that I like and I think it might be one of his top ten verses ever. When I listen to it, it makes me feel like I'm in an 80s inspired neon disco roller skating arena.
* The DNA choreography is one of my favourites. The bit where they link hands and does like a current thing during the chorus just before the bridge looks really cool.
* I have next to no interest in the BU although I liked reading the webtoon. However, I appreciate how it brings the fandom together and encourages armys to come up with a lot of interesting theories and fan art.
* I really liked use of traditional instruments in Idol and I'm hoping that they release more songs which also uses traditional instruments.",109,60,False,self,,,,,

I'm selling because I realized it doesn't quite go with anything in my wardrobe atm, so hopefully someone can give it a lot of love. It's a size M and is quite over sized. It's only been worn a couple of times and is in great condition. Fair warning: the buttons make a rattling sound esp when unbuttoned, but it's not too bad. I originally paid around $100 i think, so I'm looking to sell for $70 but i'm willing to negotiate on the price.

I am a rather new fan of BTS (around 2 months now) and, like many others, I have fallen into the rabbithole with extreme speed. Reading the posts in this subreddit made me very curious about the other people in here, though, so I'd really like to know how exactly you first came into contact with BTS and how you became an actual fan of theirs?

What I'm also curious about is why you like them. I mean yes, their music obviously :) but if there are other aspects of them that make you love them, I'd be really interested to know. ARMY is one of the fandoms that's really, really dedicated to their boys and therefore I think many people must have a personal connection to them besides just liking their music.

I'll start: I have slept on them for too long, obviously  I first heard of them when I was watching REACT and saw IDOL. I honestly thought the video was extremely wacky and too much for my taste (in my mind it fit perfectly with the ""crazy K-Pop"" stigma), but I absolutely loved the song. Since I've been learning Japanese for 6 years now I am used to listening to songs in a language I don't understand, and I listened to IDOL a lot. That was during fall 2018 I think, like shortly after they came back with this song. Then I slept on them again for several months... and in July youtube suggested the SNL performance of Boy with Luv to me after I had seen the BWL music video on REACT (I don't even check that channel that often haha). BWL still is not one of my favourites to listen to (I still like it though), and the actual reason I started looking into BTS was that J-Hope looked so extremely handsome in that performance  So I had to find out who he was, and then I started watching more and more videos and yeah now I'm here! 

(By the way, I'm \*insert RM voice\* Swiss and if there are other Swiss ARMYs in this subreddit I'd love to talk, because I'm really all alone with my love for BTS here ;;)

I'm super curious to know your stories!",91,38,False,self,,,,,

I think the 2017 AMA). When every pointed to RM, he looked so affronted saying, ""I like peace! I love peace, my favourite bird is pigeons. I love pigeons!""

&amp;#x200B;

After commenting on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/d8y96s/190924_bts_world_tour_love_yourself_speak/) about helping people get tickets/how to get tickets now that presale is over, I got a lot of PMs asking questions. Rather than answering them all individually, I figured I would answer them all in one post in case others are wondering the same things. When I first moved to Korea, some of the info about ticketing was confusing to me, so I hope that this can be of use to some of you guys and that everyone is able to get tickets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What is cancel ticketing ()?**

When tickets are canceled, whether deliberately or due to the buyer missing the payment deadline, these tickets are re-released for purchase at different times on Interpark. Buying these canceled tickets is called cancel ticketing by Koreans.

On Twitter, you can search and often find info about where the seats that people are canceling are located or what dates the tickets are for. Since tickets will often go quickly when re-released, knowing ahead of time where they might be or which day they are for can help.

&amp;#x200B;

**When is the best time to try to get tickets now?**

The time each ticketing site re-releases canceled tickets is different. For Interpark, it's **2\~2:20 am KST**. There is also sometimes another wave at around 3 am KST if there are enough tickets to be re-released. Please note that if no tickets have been canceled recently, then no tickets will be available even at these times.

Tickets are also sometimes randomly released through out the day so randomly checking can also be beneficial. However, the best times to check are the ones above. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How many tickets can you purchase with one (1) account?**

A single account can purchase two (2) tickets per show, meaning up to six (6) tickets total. If two tickets are purchased for the same day, one is considered a companion ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do companion tickets work?**

If one buyer purchased two tickets, they may bring someone along with them to use the other ticket. That ticket is being referred to as a companion ticket. People using a companion ticket must go through identity verification with the purchaser/the person whose name is on the actual ticket in order to receive their wristband and be admitted for entry to the concert. You cannot use this ticket without the purchaser there as you will be unable to have your identity verified without them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I buy resale/from places like Ticketbay, etc.?**

According to BH/Interpark, you are not supposed to buy resale. If you end up doing so however, the only way that a resale ticket would work is if you buy a companion ticket and the original purchaser accompanies you.

Keywords to look for (in Korean):  (in person pick-up, safer than delivery),  (means you'll accompany them through identity verification, etc.)

Please note though that even if you find someone who is doing in person pick-up and will help you get the wristband, you may still have issues getting in so make sure it's worth the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**May I have one of your tickets since you got 5/do your friends have spare tickets I can have?**

4 of  those tickets were bought on my account: two are mine, and the other two are companion tickets for my friends. The 5th ticket was bought through my friend's account for her and that's the only ticket any of my friends have outside of the companion tickets. So unless we are able to get more through cancel ticketing, those two companion tickets won't be available for anyone else to use.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you help me get a ticket?**

I will do my best to get extra tickets but I can't guarantee anything. There are  several people who asked me so it will end up being on a first-come-first-serve basis along with what date is available, if you've already booked your flight, etc. so it is impossible for me to help everyone. That being said, I will do my best since I know what it's like to not be able to get a ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

**How would I pay you if you got me a ticket?**

If I manage extra companion tickets through my or my friend's accounts, payment would be via PayPal in-person before you receive the ticket and go through identity verification. Bank transfer would also be possible for those of you in Korea/with Korean bank accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any other questions, just let me know and I will do my best to explain/answer!\^\^",17,39,False,self,,,,,

I know their authenticity is a huge draw and one of the more unique things about them relative to other Kpop groups but I've also come across comments that suggested given how manufactured Kpop is, even this element of their image is heavily manufactured and even things like them writing their own songs are heavily regulated and get a lot of company input, or how they act in Vlives or talks shows etc. Honestly, given the fact that idols *are* indeed heavily controlled and image-based I don't find this to be the most unreasonable assumption (though it still is an assumption, unlike say, early debut roles being slotted to members such as ""bad boy"" or ""cute/innocent one"" which idols have commented on before.). We know all of the idol groups and BTS isn't really an exception to this, are heavily managed and for instance, won't say anything *too* provocative or controversial and alot tend to have managers always nearby when doing stuff like live streams and etc.

I wanted to know what are your thoughts on this, counter-arguments or if you even agree with the premise and can expand on it?",77,0,False,self,,,,,

I have decided to pare down my photocard collection (I was caught somewhere between collecting JK and OT7 and have decided to just collect JK moving forward!) and am looking to sell off all but my Jungkook photocards from most of the albums. 

[AVAILABLE PHOTOCARDS HERE!](https://imgur.com/a/QSRaI0k)

* All photocards, regardless of member (or group), are $9. If you would like to purchase 5+, I can drop the price down to $7/ea. 
* US only, please! I apologize but I'm looking to keep selling these as simple as possible. I'm TX-based!
* Cards will be sent via USPS mail, stamped. Tracking can be made available upon request, but the buyer will assume a $3 shipping fee to be paid up front with the purchase and shipping may be delayed as I do not live close to a post office and work full-time. 
* PCs will be sent in penny sleeves and protective top loaders. 
* Payment accepted through Paypal G&amp;S only; the fee will be the buyers' responsibility. Photocards will only be considered sold once payment has been received.
* Please DM me if interested! :)

This is the first time I've attempted repainting dolls.  

JungKook's eyes turned out with eyeliner being heavier than I wanted because I kept tinkering with it too long, but I guess I'll just leave it since there's no guarantee that re-attempt will be any better.   I'm still reasonably happy with it.

The hair, on the other hand... I've attempted to trim it but it seems to have a life of its own.  (JungKook!  How could you let your hair grow just after I trimmed your hair!)

Long version: My job involves a lot of drawing and my extremely talented coworker has challenged me to do [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) with him. Inktober is a month long art challengethat is focused on improving skill and developing positive drawing habits. I'd like to do an all BTS theme but I'm relatively new to ARMY and I am still catching up on all 6 years of content. I don't have enough BTS knowledge yet to come up with ideas for all 31 days. I'm looking for a healthy mix of more serious and symbolic ideas from their music/MVs as well as silly clownery from Run, Bombs, BV, VLive, memes; as long as the idea relates back to the original prompt! This is the first time I've ever tried to do Inktober and I know I'll feel more confident when the ideas are in place and I can focus on the drawing itself. Take a look at the official prompt list below, thank you in advance for your suggestions!

Aside but related, if anyone wants to join in on this BTS themed Inktober, you're invited :)

Here is what happened
https://twitter.com/BerryIsland88/status/1178500861783347201?s=19

As you can see she didn't like viral songs being meaningless &amp; half-heart written. We had a conversation. At the end she said she wanted to give a try to BTS because of the respectful conversation. Like you guys don't know how it made my day. She was so sweet!


With this, I am not saying reply to everyone who doesn't like it nor write ""when bts first started..."" &amp; write their whole story. I am not the best example.
I just want to inform you guys what is happening under chicken noodle soup MV.

Whether one likes it or not, in every single minute we are getting comments from non-fans. You know locals watching MV is one thing, comments coming from time to time is one thing but comments keep coming in every min is a whole another thing. It's so crazy. 
Most of these locals are so ready to have conversation.

Maybe it has become possible because the top comments aren't all about streams &amp; views nor just typical ""fangirl"" comments about look but geniune appreciation comments. Maybe it is because the title didn't have BTS in it. Idk.
But guys we have the opportunity to make a non-fan into BTS fan in every single min. ARMYs have that salesman power. BTS has that IT. This is so crazy!",9,10,False,self,,,,,
