29,2019-2-1,2019,2,1,21,am1o0q,190131 Billboard: Lee Sora &amp; Suga Debut on World Digital Song Sales With 'Song Request' (by Jeff Benjamin),FakeuLarb,1549025259,"[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8496018/lee-sora-bts-suga-song-request-world-digital-sales-chart](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8496018/lee-sora-bts-suga-song-request-world-digital-sales-chart)

&amp;#x200B;

The sentimental single marks the first entry for the BTS member using his original stage name. 

The *Billboard* charts got to meet both Lee Sora and Suga this week thanks to the Korean ballad singer's new collaboration with theBTS rapper.

Lee Sora's ""Song Request"" featuring Sugadebuts at No. 2 on *Billboard*'s [World Digital Song Sales chart](https://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/world-digital-song-sales)  this week with3,000 downloads sold in the week ending Jan. 24,  according to Nielsen Music. Notably, the song's Jan. 22 release gave it  less than two days to rack up sales.

While this is technically the first World Digital Songs entry for both Lee and Suga, the 25-year-old rapper hasbowed on the charts using his solo aliasAgust D which counts for *Billboard* tracking purposes.Suga(real nameMin Yoongi)has sent to both his*Agust D* mixtape to[the World](https://www.billboard.com/charts/world-albums) and [Heatseekers](https://www.billboard.com/charts/heatseekers-albums)Albums  charts, and has also landed four entries from the tape onWorld Digital  Song Sales, hitting as high as No. 4 with ""Give It to Me."" And while it  was officially credited as BTS, the song ""Trivia : Seesaw"" from the  band's [Billboard 200](https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200)topping*Love Yourself: Answer*album was performed by Sugaand nearly made a [Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100) debut when it peaked at No. 22 on the [Hot 100 Bubbling Under chart](https://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/bubbling-under-hot-100-singles).

Among  the BTS entries on World Digital Song Sales that have been officially  credited to the specific members (and not ""BTS""), fiveof the seven  members have made solo appearances.

RM made the first appearance in 2015 when his track ""P.D.D"" with [Warren G](https://www.billboard.com/music/warren-g)  bowed in the Top 10 (when RM was still known as Rap Monster). But RM's  highest solo entry came late last year when he featured on [Tiger JK](https://www.billboard.com/music/tiger-jk)'s ""Timeless,"" which peaked at No. 4 on the chart.

Meanwhile, J-Hope is the only member to hit No. 1 when""Daydream,"" the lead single to his *Hope World*  mixtape, hit No. 1 in early 2018. Plus, members Jin and V teamed up for  a soundtrack contribution song titled ""It's Definitely You"" that peaked  at No. 8 on the chart in February 2017. All the BTS members have  recorded and released songs on their own, but many times the artist  credited for the track remains as BTS.",4,1

So it's time for our sunshine Hobi's birthday campaign-#SmileWithHoseok! 

This month, we are partnering with Transforming Faces, a Canada-based organization that provides medical care to children affected by cleft lip and palate, specifically supporting their work in Peru. Children born with cleft lip or cleft palateare given a tough start in life. They often have problems with eating andspeaking clearly. Hearing problems, ear infections, and dental problems are other common side effects.Though we wish it weren't so, children and adults living with cleft lip or cleft palate often endure bullying anddiscrimination.  Hoseok is known for his beautiful, heart-shaped smile, but also for the way he radiates happiness. We figured it was a natural fit to partner with an organization that literally brings smiles to children's faces. 

Here is the current campaign thread w/info and the link to donate: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1090263335289774082](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1090263335289774082)

This month's video for the campaign: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjpbv1iS2XU&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjpbv1iS2XU&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

For our extra activity, we are doing something we are calling #HOPEfulSmiles. The goal is to spread joy and make other people smile the way Hoseok makes us smile! We are encouraging people to go out and make other people around them. To help that, we made sunshine cards, both physical and digital, for you to give to people when you do make them smile that have a qr code/url on them that leads to a surprise! Let's see how far those cards can reach by the end of the month! More info and links to the card templates are in this thread: [https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1090628200013664257](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1090628200013664257)

It got me thinking...based solely off what I know about them (which granted isn't much since I'm sure they keep their private selves separate from their public persona) who do I think would make a good match with me? Then that prompted the question, who do I think would be my best friend? 

&amp;#x200B;

So just for fun (and mods if this violates any rules please feel free to delete), and putting all biases aside; if you had to choose a member to spend the rest of your life with who could you actually see being a good match for you and why? Maybe it's just me, but I think a lot of people might answer someone different from who their ""bias"" is for those who have one or multiple. Also, who do you think you would click with in that special way best friends have and why? 

&amp;#x200B;

While I genuinely think all of Bangtan are going to make a special individual very happy someday. For myself, if I had to choose a member to marry it would probably be Hoseok. Not only is he extremely attractive, but I could see him bringing an immeasurable amount of joy into his partner's life. He's also serious when it matters most, responsible, hard-working and seems trust-worthy (which is a HUGE thing for me). Based on our personalities we're opposites in ways I think would mesh well. The one point where we would probably butt heads would be cleanliness. I grew up with a mother who is meticulous about cleaning, so while I do love a tidy house thanks to her strict rules lol I don't do well with people telling me what to do and I doubt I'm near as meticulous as Hoseok is XD. I could see that either being a problem or something he picks up the slack and does himself. Now the only problem would be...who does the cooking? Maybe we'll flip for it...

&amp;#x200B;

I think my best friend would 100% be Jin. Not only is he hilarious, I think he'd be one of those friends where it's just easy to be around each other. Where you spend the majority of your time together cracking up while everyone looks at you like you're a little insane. I think he'd also bring me out of my shell and push me to try and do crazy fun things. I also see him being one of those friends you can call at 3am because you're having a break-down and they'll show up at your door with a grip of chocolate, a bottle of wine and a shoulder to cry on.

In light BTS' (supposed) looming comeback, I thought I'd bring up the topic of showcases. BTS haven't had any since Dark&amp;Wild right? I thought it was interesting that they stopped having them, especially since they seem so prevalent within the larger kpop industry. Was there any specific reasoning behind not having one since then? I know that they sync quite a few of their comebacks right before concerts so the concert serves kind of like a showcase too.  I don't think they really need them, the question is just out of pure curiosity. 

&amp;#x200B;

And on the topic of showcases, does anyone have any favorite performances/anecdotes (like watching them live)/fun tidbits to add? I think I can safely speak for a good number of us when I say this performance of [Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_TFT7nHW6U) is iconic. ",12,1

My guess is maybe another television appearance of some kind- like Ellen or another LA based show. If they film Carpool Karaoke Id convulse.

I've noticed it mostly with makeup artists/stylists/whatever... Sometimes a girl 1 foot shorter than them will be reaching up to do their makeup and they just completely look away or start talking to someone else. I've always thought this was kind of rude..? Are they doing it just for the cameras, or what? My only conclusion is that they don't want to be shown interacting with the female staff too much because of possessive fans lol, but I find that kind of ridiculous so I was wondering if there was another reason.

No offense to BTS, I know they're kind and humble boys who probably don't intend to be rude.

It's a size M, brand new, but I did cut off the string + black paper rectangle tag. It's one of the newer pajama sets that they released around the holidays. I'm happy to meet up and pass it over in person if you're in NYC as well, otherwise shipping will probably be something like 5-7$ with a tracking number!

237,2019-2-7,2019,2,7,19,ao28a3,What do you guys think of a J-Hope solo concert?,dramaticnoir,1549533642,"Back in November 2017 just before the AMAs, the boys had an interview with KIIS FM. They were explaining the whole ""J-Hope showing his abs"" when they hit 10M followers on V-Live. When the interviewer asked what J-Hope would do when they reached 15M followers on Twitter Jin volunteered that J-Hope gives a solo concert. Now I know it was just a joke BUT I won't lie to you, it got me thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love Hoseok as an artist and as a performer. Hope World showcased his abilities for all to see and did so well on Billboard, but I still just don't feel like people fully realise just how much bloody talent and sheer versatility this guy has (not you guys on here, you guys get it). It's a given that everyone knows he's an amazing dancer, but sometimes I think he gets overlooked in terms of his abilities as a rapper, vocalist, songwriter, composer, and all round performer. He really is the golden hyung.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway! While I think it's veryy unlike to ever actually happen, many idols from popular groups do branch out and embark on solo shows a little later in their careers. So imagine if J-Hope did put on a solo concert. What do you think it would be like? Do you think it's a possibility or even a good idea? Could he hold a solo show? How would you feel about Suga or RM having a solo? Which of the holy trinity would you absolutely have to see? While we're at it, what about the vocal line? I'm getting carried away with my own thoughts. What are yours? ",31,1

Out of all of my favourite songs, The Last (and pretty much the whole of Agust D lol) being up there is probably the most surprising to me because its so intense and doesnt really fit the relaxed vibe I usually favour.

They have become what I see as the paradigm of unabated success for me but also some depression (have cried my eyes out multiple times because I wish I had their drive to succeed, but topic for another post). Anyways, what I wanted to ask in this post is about BTS and university. From what I have seen on various wikis (of varying levels of being reputable), most (if not all) of the members are either currently attending an online university or pursuing their master's degree after completing an undergraduate degree (I believe Jin is doing this). My honest question is... why? How is it even *remotely* feasible? Don't get me wrong, I am in no way against the perpetual search for knowledge (I am a premed in university right now, applying to medical school this summer pray for me pls) but how in the hell do they even have the time to think about anything related to academics? From what I could only imagine they have to deal with practicing choreography, making (seemingly) unending amazing music, going on massive tours, preparing for interviews, preparing for comebacks, recording various shows such as Run! and making documentaries, being available to fans through V Live, pursuing business-related ventures (how tf did Jin even have time to plan out a restaurant with his brother that is now apparently successful in Korea???), among millions of other tasks none of us have could have any idea about. This is part of why I get sad as I just wish I had the mental strength they have to constantly work for what they want to achieve without any breaks (I watch youtube for about 2-3 hours a day, while I'd imagine they don't spend a second on it, for example). Furthermore, they are all without a doubt worth more than $10 mil at this point. At least for me, at that point if I had such a successful thing as BTS going I would drop everything else and solely focus on that. I am American by nationality and the culture here is to make money and then drop everything else once you have enough of it. 

While it may be likely that they may have reduced assignment loads by virtue of their extremely busy schedule, what do you guys think? Do we have proof that they are indeed attending university? Their staff probably has an enormous part in their success and most likely help them in this regard. This was just something that I've been questioning since I learned about them, so please don't take offense as I am in no way intending to come off as spiteful or ignorant. ",33,1

I agree that there can be immature and problematic fans,but they exist in all fandoms and denying that or excusing that as ""just being a small part of the fandom and not everyone"" is hypocritical,in my opinion.Also,calling ARMYs toxic because they constantly promote BTS and defend them is also hypocritical because all fandoms do that.As for hyping all their achievements up,voting for them and calling them your favourites in any field(singing,dancing,raping etc),don't all fandoms do that as well?Comparing them to other groups and saying others are better...isn't that a matter of taste?And do ARMYs have to know and listen to all other Kpop groups to call BTS their favourites?

And yes,I know we can get petty and defensive sometimes!!!We can hold grudges too.I know that.But we have never done something so serious that would justify other group stans calling us the ""most toxic and problematic Kpop fandom"".We've never mass-liked or mass-trended something hateful to another group,we've never wished for other groups to die,we've never done a black ocean,have never tried to sabotage someone's comeback or release,we've never done something extreme to BTS nor have we ever gotten in a physical fight with other fandoms like older fandoms did.Even if there is an article or tweet shading other groups and there are...like 36.000 likes and comments or even 170.000 likes and comments from ARMYs(have not seen this yet)...that's like 1% of the whole fandom.That's 1% of 17 million people.You can't really generalize from 1% of a group of people.

I can see why people could consider us as annoying(bc we're everywhere) or defensive.Even petty or known to hold grudges.But I can't see why they'd consider us the most problematic or toxic fandom when other fandoms have done the same or worst things.What are your thoughts on this?Do you think the narrative is justified?Do you think ARMYs are more toxic than other fandoms?",4,1

She frequently gaslighted me, ridiculed my homosexuality, physically assaulted me, and generally acted as my bully. I recently departed ways with her, which has been very liberating, but the main thing I took away with our friendship was the fact that she talked about BTS all the time even if no one in the group was interested at all. She treated these boys as these Gods whilst she ignored her other friends who didn't immediately take interest in these boys. Inevitably, throughout our years together, I too got into BTS. I got to experience many of the iconic eras (TMBMIL and Wings) with her, which is one of the positive experiences I took from our relationship. 

Nowadays, BTS is everywhere and thus difficult to ignore. I still do hear snippets of their music (which I believe is genuinely amazing) and I think that they're all such wonderful, inspirational people, and I miss enjoying them, but I can't watch any bangtan videos or music without getting irked with really horrid memories I had to go to therapy for. I don't want her to hold a grip on my life anymore, so I consulted all of your ARMYS for your advice on how to enjoy them again. I really think they could have a positive effect on my life. Thank you so much. ",0,1

And when I mean friends I don't mean just mutals and all that jazz,  I'm thinking like actual friends? See,  I have some amazing friends who are into kpop as well,  but they're not super super into Bangtan; so it's a little lonesome when I wanna talk about them for a long time but can't do so bc they'll eventually get bored and stuff :( that's not a bad thing at all btw! 

(I also stand other groups but my ultimate/bias group is BTS)

I guess what I'm trying to say is if anyone would love to chit chat about BTS and they're amazing personalities and music,  please message me on here or Twitter! I really love making new friends and being able to cry over our lovely boys!

So I've been thinking of buying a broadcast photo (more specifically a spring day one) but I have no idea how to determine if it's authentic or not. Is there any specific thing I should look for in broadcast photos? 

I don't really have any experience with those kind of photos as I've only recently started collecting photocards so any kind of help would be appreciated!

Not by the camera work, not by the wardrobe, not  by the choreography, not even by the megamash-up. I mean, yes all of those things were wonderful, but the *audience*. It was insane. It was amazing. 
 
Two girls got up to do a shoot dance in front of the screen. There was dancing, there was screaming, there was chanting, there was flailing around. Someone in the row in front of me knocked herself back in her seat when Jin hit *that* note like the Dragonborn was upon us. I wish I could have recorded a video clip with my eyes to upload and cherish because that was some downright faith healing in action.
 
Now, there were definitely a few people in the audience who seemed to be there just out of curiosity and didn't react much at first. A handful of older couples (I noticed a few dirty looks early on regarding the use of phone screens as bombs), some obvious dates that were either very quiet fans or just supporting their significant others, etc. The theater was mostly full and the people who weren't dancing a little (or a lot) in their seats stood out early on in the sea of people that were. 

But by Anpanman? EVERYONE was moving. Even my husband, a casual fan by circumstance but not a rhythmically inclined fellow, was bobbing his head to songs he's heard a hundred times but never really *listened* to. The contagious energy was insane. Nobody was shushing the people who were being boisterous, nobody left (I really thought one grouchy well-dressed older couple I was watching were going to a couple times, but they were actually smiling when I saw them in the hall), and I'm still glowing from the experience.

It wasn't really concert-level, like nothing can quite duplicate that raw energy and emotion, but it was like no theater experience I've ever had. That kind of atmosphere at the movies could have easily had people who weren't expecting it asking management for a voucher but instead they left *smiling*.

So thank you, ARMYs of Southeast Michigan. I would have felt weird singing quietly and mouthing chants in a quiet room if that was how it turned out, but instead I got a hit of nostalgia for Chicago and a night to remember. I'm going to put the movie tickets in the LY concert shadowbox.

I am selling a couple things from 2019 Season's Greetings in hopes that they will find a good home and someone can get better use out of them than I can. I also have LY Tour posters from both the NA leg and Japan that I have absolutely no more room on my walls for lol. Here is a list and album of the things I am selling:

Season's Greetings 2019 Mini Posters - $15 each + shipping

LY Japan Tour Posters (all unfolded) - $15 each + shipping

One thing to note about the Jimin Japan tour poster is that it came with this weird crease across where his chin is. I added a picture of how it looks from the front and the back of the poster. You can't see it unless you're looking up close at the poster, but it's still annoying. I'll knock $3 off of the Jimin Japan poster because of the weird defect, so that one would be $12 + shipping. All the posters will be shipped in mail tube shipping boxes. I'm also open to giving discounts for bundling items together. Paypal or Venmo would be fine for everything. Thanks y'all!

[K-pop band BTS](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bts-wins-social-media-grammys-2019-1185401), Peter Jackson and the enduring popularity of *The Wizard of Oz*  helped propel distributor Fathom Events to its biggest month ever in  January, with roughly $11.6 million in combined box office ticket sales.

Special event screenings last month of the concert pic *BTS World Tour: Love Yourself in Seoul* led the way with $3.5 million, followed by Jackson's World War I documentary *They Shall Never Grow Old* ($2.64 million), *The Wizard of Oz* ($2 million), *Rachel Hollis: Made for More* ($1.58 million) and *The Met Live HD: Adriana Lecouvreur* ($1.35 million).

The January boom followed a stellar 2018 for Fathom. For example,  Jackson's film made an additional $5.66 million during two screenings in  December for a total take of $8.3 million, easily a Fathom record for a  doc.

In January, special 80th anniversary showings of *Wizard of Oz* over the course of four nights also set a [new mark for a classic title hosted by Fathom](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-wizard-oz-sets-fathom-record-1183375). Previous record-holders included the 40th anniversary of Steven Spielberg's *Jaws* in 2015 ($1.62 million); a 2014 presentation of *Gone With the Wind* ($1.55 million); and 2017s 30th anniversary presentation of *The* *Princess Bride* ($1.48 million), all of which were presented in partnership with TCM.

Warner Bros.' *Wizard of Oz* kicks off Fathom's yearlong 2019  TCM Big Screen Classics series, presented in partnership with Turner  Classic Movies. Upcoming titles includes *My Fair Lady* and*To Kill a Mockingbird.*

On Jan. 26, *BTS World Tour* took in $2.8 million,  Fathom's highest single-day gross for a music event (that was followed  by encore performances on Jan. 31).

Fathom's previous biggest month was in December 2018 ($11.4 million),  and its third-best showing was in October 2017 ($9.9 million).

""You have to have the right content,"" says Fathom CEO Roy Nutt.  ""Event cinema truly came into its own in 2018, with more creators and  producers embracing the increasingly important role Fathom plays in  distribution.""

I've had this idea for so long now but didn't want to post because I wanted to make sure it's actually do-able. I love buying BTS merchandise but clothing wise there isn't a big variety, it's okay for a casual style but not much else honestly hoodies, pullovers and Tee's are getting boring. I love fashion and I honestly want a bit more, I want to be able to do different style's that screams BTS&amp;ARMY for those who are dedicated fans but for people that aren't in the know it's just a fashionable outfit. what I want, is leather jackets, embroidered jeans, sexy/ cute dresses, leggings, skirts, pants... and I want all of this to scream BTS to any ARMY that sees it.

I've been stuck on google for about a month now and I'm fairly certain I can do it, it will just cost me a bit to start up. I don't want to do a start up if I don't know how it will be received.

my main problem at the moment was getting an artist to help me with some designs and drawing the models wearing the outfits but I can commission artist for that, just going to cost me a between 20 to 80 dollars per drawing, which is why I need to know if this is a good idea or it will be a wast of money I could spend somewhere else. (unless any of you are good artist willing to lend a hand for a percentage of the income made from the line, lmao would save me so much)

either way do you think this would be a good idea?

What made you fall in love with these boys and what they do?

What songs or aspects of BTS first sucked you in, and why?

What keeps you coming back, sticking along for the ride, wanting to continue with them?   
Why haven't you 'given them up' yet (like others may have for 'becoming too mainstream', etc)?

I apologise if this has been a topic before, I'm fairly new to Reddit and I'm just so curious and interested to hear different ARMYs journeys!

  
Here's my story -

For me, honestly, the depth in their music was what first drew me to them. And then their open honesty, their close relationship with each other that was genuine and not fake for the cameras, their not caring what people thought about them, if they 'looked lame'. They were so different from what I'd ever expected from K-pop, and frankly, most other groups that were out there. They were more than bandmates and colleagues.

I grew up in an Asian country, and ever since I was a kid, Korean pop music has been pretty well known. I knew about all the old songs, even before SNSD to be honest. But I never really got into it. Sure, it was catchy, but I never really got sucked into it the way a lot of my peers did. I also kind of looked down on it for being plastic, manufactured, simply about producing the catchiest songs and dances to make viral hits.  

But when my sister added BTS to her Spotify playlist back in 2014-2015 was when it all changed for me. I decided to look up the songs Dope and Danger because they sounded different from all other K-pop I'd heard. I said to my sister ""What's the name of that K-pop song with the jazz/trumpets"" and went on YouTube and the rest is history (for both me and my sister lol).  I discovered AMAZING dance and choreography. Amazing rap and singing. The lyrics of Dope really caught me - ""I'm staying up all night working in the studio while you're out clubbing - I'm pretty dope"", and ""Samppo sedae / Oppo sedae / ... Yukppo sedae?"" firing back at anti-millennial sentiments? I was fucking down with this shit.  

And then my friend introduced me to No More Dream  and N.O - she'd known them since their debut. I found Baepsae (using traditional Korean sayings to diss adults calling millennials and ""tryhards/worthless""), Cypher Pt. 2 (firing back at their haters in the underground hip hop community). I saw their Bangtan Bomb videos of them being RELATABLE IDIOTS backstage, their social media openly talking about producing music and writing meaningful concepts - and I immediately felt that I'd found my people, lmao. Their Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa era stood out to me a lot - it was about the transition period between youth/adult, and they were all around the same age, and I felt like someone finally understood. I immediately got the meaning of the HYYH phrase having grown up studying Chinese (the years that are like flowers - 'hwa' in Korean means both 'flower' and 'suffering'), and stayed up to watch Run's comeback stage live.  

And I've been an ARMY ever since. I've watched almost all their videos, their livestreams, laughed and cried, seen them live 3 times in 3 different countries, met Jin and Jimin accidentally while shopping in Tokyo (kind of insane), watched them grow and come into their own. I've seen them all struggle with pressure, with internal and external issues, with self-image and self-worth. They are so human it's astounding.  

And now, they still inspire me every day - I'm trying to love myself, and be a better person for no one but myself. I'm an artist, like they are, even if my work is different. I studied theatre at university, and intend to do it for a living, but it's hard. BTS remind me to love myself, keep going, appreciate everything around me. Listening to their music, watching their content, reading their thoughts heals me, and I can't wait to grow up and grow old with them. ",4,1

Earlier this week, my school held our annual ""International Night"" event to showcase our school's diversity (this is a U.S. high school for context). 

There was a group of Indian kids that performed an AMAZING medley of dances to Bollywood music, and it gave me an idea - why not get some of my girlfriends together and do a K-Pop dance for the next International Night? 

(Quick disclaimer: we're Korean girls, so please don't flame us for cultural appropriation or whatnot... we're all very proud of our heritage (K-Pop is just *one* of the many aspects of South Korean culture that we are proud of) and we would like to showcase this in the most entertaining and relatable way possible). 

We figured, since BTS is currently the most mainstream K-Pop group in the US, it would be a good idea to do a dance to one of their songs (and preferably a recent song). 

None of us are trained/experienced dancers (unless one semester of a HS Modern Dance class counts), but we have about a year to practice the dance we choose until it's time to perform it. 

**So, here's where I need your help: What BTS song/dance is most well known to the general American population (not just US ARMY) and would be reasonable enough for our inexperienced group to pull off in a year? **

I was thinking DNA (because of the AMAs), Fake Love, or IDOL (the traditional remix), but what do you guys think?

Thank you so much! I purple you! :) &lt;3

As of now Spring Day from BTS is the longest charting idol group song (though I don't want categorize them as idol group rather as musician) on melon (Korean music chart). Love yourself answer album on bb200 as another example.

so giving spring day as an example I want to hear opinion regarding what make a song or an album chart longer in various chart? Is it fandom power or general public? 

First I will state my opinion, for me fandom power can only help to push the song or album at the top so that it can be noticed by the public, and probably for 1 week or the longest 1 month? The rest or longevity of he song or album is depend on the general public and the fan if they really like the song or album..frankly no matter how much you love your group/ artist you can't possibly force yourself stream/ listen to their song all the time if you don't really like it, right? Or is it just me? The longevity of the song /album depend on fandom power or general public or both? ",14,1

With bts, for my brain its all or nothing. I cant just take them or leave them; if I let them into my life at all Ill just get swept down a huge hole and it starts to consume too much of my thoughts. I have to keep constantly putting myself on bts diets (lmaoooo fml) in order to wean myself off them and focus on my own life.
Its not like this with any other kpop artists or western artists, or anything else in my life for that matter. 

Despite being swept into the bts vortex because theyre so appealing and fun, it makes me depressed. This is why I have to keep cutting them out of my life.. at some point I just start to feel... like absolute shit.. about everything.. lol.

Being the same age as JK, I feel an awful, inexplicable stress surrounding him which I assume comes from the misguided belief that because my life isnt following the same trajectory as his, Im a failure. Basically I compare myself to him. I think the comparison thing is something a lot of older armys struggle with. I just cant stop.. I feel like such a loser for not being as successful as them. And I know this is stupid! But I cant shake the feeling.

I feel like this was atrociously written. I barely explained how I feel. Hopefully this makes sense. 

Does anyone else feel this? I wanted to start a discussion about this. If bts makes you feel like shit and you cant casually stan without it getting way out of hand, Id super love to hear your thoughts. ",3,1

So I heard and watched a few videos on American talk shows last year and I just found them adorable! They have such a vibrant energy which you rarely see in a lot of celebrities these days ! And I saw all the hype around them at the Grammys so I decided to fully research them and Im not lying when I say that I spent every free minute I had on YouTube watching their songs and interviews! Still getting used to their names and faces because every time their hair is so different  I end up getting confused ! Im so in love with RM though! Anyway Im not into a lot of music so I shocked myself when I found myself humming and already knowing the words to DNA !! 

I love everything about BTS ... they songs and message is so much more than what I would have expected from a boy group ! 

Anyway Im looking for their bangtan bombs (I hope Im right ? ) with English subtitles? I found a few on YouTube but I think a lot have been deleted.. is anyone willing to help me find and link me some ? And any other content that might me fun to watch ? And what are your favorite songs to listen to ? Just hit me with all the content since I cant get enough! 

Thanks in advance ",38,1

Second, there're Just a few things I want to say. 

1.As an army I find other armys very annoying and delusional. 

2. Armys who say that others shouldn't assume bts sexuality and then call them gay ( I know it's just a joke but c'mon...) are hypocrites (coming from a Bi person). 

3. I hate how armys treat bts like their gods and the best thing that ever happened to earth. 

4. Jin and taehyung are treated the worst by bighit.( especially jin) 
 

5. RM should get more credit for his lgbtq+ knowledge /encouragement.



6. Fake love wasn't that good.

I had been struggling with depression for years and I was on the brink of suicide. I saw that someone on my Snap story was advertising LSD, so I figured fuck it and bought 3 tabs and dropped all of them. It was a pretty bad experience altogether because of the setting and my depression. But in the afterglow, LY Answer saved my life.

I was driving home listening to their message of loving yourself and everything just clicked. It took a 30 minute drive to fix what prescriptions and therapy couldn't for years. 

So, moving on to the tattoo idea. I was thinking of getting a ""Bicycle Day"" tattoo (reminiscent of Albert Hoffman riding a bicycle while tripping for the first time), but he has earbuds or headphones or something and instead of the sun and moon, it's the art for the flower from LY Her and the heart from LY Answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Suga - Most of the time I'll just call Suga, Suga. Depending on context or if I'm talking about him more personally I'll call him Yoongi but most of the time I'll just say Suga. If I'm having a conversation I'll say Suga but if I'm typing it I'm more prone to use Yoongi

&amp;#x200B;

RM - I don't think I've ever called him RM, 99% of the time I'll call him Joon or if I'm speaking about him to someone else I'll say Namjoon but other than that, I've never really used his stage name

&amp;#x200B;

V - Again, I can't really remember using his stage name other than when I first became a BTS fan, now I just refer to him as Tae

&amp;#x200B;

J-Hope - I don't really use J-Hope, 99% of the time I'll say Hobi or sometimes I'll say Hoseok, but not often

&amp;#x200B;

Jin - Jin is Jin! I know some people say Seokjin but I always just say Jin

&amp;#x200B;

Jimin - Again, I always just say Jimin. I wish I had another name for him but none of the nicknames really seem to stick for me so I always just address him as that

&amp;#x200B;

Jungkook - I always say Jungkook but if I'm typing it I'll say JK / Kook (mostly JK) but I think that's because it sounds a little less formal when reading it",160,1

https://imgur.com/a/J1SltY3

This is how it went:

Whats BTS?

Oh its Kpop

Ah Hip Hop?

Uh, no **K**pop

Kpop?

Yeah...BTS is a Kpop band. Its Korean Pop

Oh, so you understand Korean?!

...no, My coworker looks confused so I continue, you dont have to know what theyre saying to understand the music.

Right... My coworker nods her head but its clear she doesnt agree. 

I see this happen a lot. Happened with my older brother too. Whenever I drove him to places I would play BTS and he would ask the same question Why listen to it when you cant understand it? I guess this is a pretty big deal, I really dont know why though. I see a lot of other people talk about this too like on Twitter. 

To me, I love everything about BTS. Listening to their songs for the first time without knowing what theyre saying makes me appreciate and try to figure out what the tone of the music could mean. Afterwards I can check the English translations online and get a whole new level of appreciation for what theyre saying, but it doesnt mean I NEED to know. Its kind of like how Ive seen other ARMYs use the example of Classical music in which there are no words but you still FEEL the music, emotionally and physically.

I'm not a very good organizer of things and my shelves pictured in the link are pretty accurate in showing that. [https://imgur.com/a/3mB2PyN](https://imgur.com/a/3mB2PyN)

After I got my 2019 SG I realized I needed to organize all the stuff I had, but I really don't know where to start. 

I'm looking for suggestions or any creative way in showing what I could do! I have a lot of BTS albums in the bottom right shelf that are kind of...out of place, a bunch of SF9 albums that I would like to have facing forward to show the signatures, Yoongi dolls, and a bunch of other stuff. My 2018 SG I ordered recently just arrived today as well but I have no room to put it anywhere at the moment LOL. 

If you ARMY want to suggest how to organize the shelves in a better fashion, please don't hesitate to comment!

I did also order all 7 of the BTS Funko Pops yesterday and would like to display them on the shelves as well (they will be sealed in the original boxes and not opened).

Happy early birthday to our wonderful sunshine, Hobi!",1,1

On the one hand, the characters are at least in a small part based on real aspects of the members, so they must have been involved to a degree. On the other, I haven't heard any of the members themselves discuss the BU and their characters in detail, so I'm wondering if they even care all that much lol.

&amp;#x200B;

##Giveaway

To honor the end of BTS Love Yourself era, as well as /r/bangtan reaching 50,000 subscribers, we wanted to give a chance for all of our subscribers to reflect on how BTS has helped them learn to love themselves, even just a little more. You can tell your story however you want, no matter how big or small the change might have been for you.  

Please know you dont have to get too personal if you dont want to - just giving a general sense is fine! We arent expecting you to reveal your darkest fears to strangers on the internet, unless youre totally comfortable with that.  

But a heartwarming thread of people loving themselves isnt all for this event!  

**Giveaway**  

Courtesy of /u/dorkprincess, we ALSO have an opened but mostly new copy of Love Yourself: Answer, L version to give away! Since we dont want to make this a competition, we will be using a random lottery to choose who wins the album.  

**If you want to share your story, but dont want the album** because you already have all 4 versions, or you just dont need another one, just say at the top of your comment Opt-out of giveaway so we know!  

Heres some specifics about the album:  

* L version  

* Suga photocard  

* Comes with folded L version poster  

* there are tiny (emphasis on tiny) dents on the bottom because its just been sitting in the back of my desk for many months  

* I already redeemed those points you get on the ibighit store site because I didnt know Id eventually use it for a giveaway, sorry :(  

* Reason its unwanted is because I pre-ordered a random version on Amazon, got the L version, and then got 2 more albums when I went to the Citi Field concert (one of which was another L version)  

* Just telling you the above story so you know its not defective or anything  

* I am willing to ship to most places even if the shipping is a bit expensive - but if shipping costs around, like, $50, not sure I can do that. Sorry Siberian BTS stans (I am located in the USA for reference)  

* [Here is an imgur album of photos of the album for your perusal](https://imgur.com/a/noGPcmh)  ",74,163

Just reposting some things I am selling from 2019 Season's Greetings and LY tour posters because I had some items open back up that were on hold. Here is a list and album of the things I am selling:

Season's Greetings 2019 Mini Posters - $15 each + shipping

LY NA Tour Posters (all unfolded) - $10 each + shipping

LY Japan Tour Posters (all unfolded) - $15 each + shipping

One thing to note about the Jimin Japan tour poster is that it came with this weird crease across where his chin is. I added a picture of how it looks from the front and the back of the poster. You can't see it unless you're looking up close at the poster, but it's still annoying. I'll knock $3 off of the Jimin Japan poster because of the weird defect, so that one would be $12 + shipping. All the posters will be shipped in mail tube shipping boxes. I'm also open to giving discounts for bundling items together. Paypal or Venmo would be fine for everything. Thanks y'all!",0,17

We all know that BTS were somewhat of a last-minute addition to the Grammys line-up. The reasoning behind this to my knowledge haven't been revealed, but I know people have been speculating that their addition was an attempt to boost ratings by the Grammys as a consequence of so many 'big stars' not attending, in an attempt to save face. We saw how BTS really made the most of this opportunity, and basically made the Grammys their own, with Namjoon even saying he changed their comment last minute to add the ""We'll be back"", in a bit of a power move that almost self-invites themselves back next year.

To me, this was almost certainly a turning point in BTS' career; western media have finally started to sit up and take notice of the absolute power of BTS and ARMY. During the night it was clear BTS were finally being treated more seriously, and not as some novelty act - there were proper interviews, they had fantastic seats and they were allowed to have the exclusive artist photographs. BTS went from a last minute addition to becoming the most talked-about artists in one big swoop, right in front of the watching higher-ups in media.

 Moving forward in a post-Grammys era, how do you expect the landscape surrounding BTS in the West to change? How do you think future award shows and high profile events will treat the boys? Do you think they will ever be nominated for something other than a social media award, and will we ever get a MMA or MAMA-level American stage? ",116,180

Any of these collaberations would be HUGE, I feel like BTS could have their first huge hit in the west if they collabed with an equally big artist. 

Is BTS restricted from working with other artists because of BigHit? Or are they perhaps just too busy? Or are some already in the works but taking so much time because they want to make it perfect?",0,1

&amp;#x200B;

*OCTOBER 2018*

&amp;#x200B;

My sisters and I are a few days out from the Citi Field concert and we had asked our parents about a week ago. Although my older sister and I are already adults, my parents are sort of over-protective. Plus, my little sister is only in middle school, so naturally, my dad went into full parent mode. The moment my mother said ""Sure, what can I do? You paid for it already,"" he jumped on the internet and searched up BTS.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a very brief parents' guide that he read and he decided to watch the Jimmy Fallon episode. Now, if I had it my way and my dad weren't so busy with work, I would have given him the list I am about to present to you all. This list is my compilation of Bangtan's discography that I *personally* believe covers their message as well as their sound evolution. This is by no means a list of Bangtan's GOAT. In fact, I think a lot of the songs that are GOAT material from Bangtan's discography don't appear on this list. This list is sort like my version of a Bangtan *Proof of Good Moral Character*. This list was compiled with the mindset of showing how socially responsible our boys are.

&amp;#x200B;

*(****Disclaimer****: I AM GOING TO USE RAP MONSTER IN THE TITLE AND ARTIST PORTION UNTIL I REFER TO HIS MIXTAPE, SOLO WORKS AND WORKS RELEASED AFTER HIS NAME CHANGE. Please bear with me, I am trying to be historically accurate!)*

&amp;#x200B;

**BANGTAN MUSIC STARTER PACK:**

&amp;#x200B;

***Pre-Debut:***

* [Vote ()](https://genius.com/Rm-vote-lyrics) \- Rap Monster
   * This is a predebut solo by (now) RM and he is 19 years old. He cannot vote yet in Korea but he displays such a high level of political awareness. It calls out the young people close to his age that *can* vote and tells them to actually take action before they start complaining about the system. The ending is so hard hitting: ""Vote or shut up."" And honestly, that is not only relevant in South Korea, it's relevant everywhere. We can totally see that here in the US where I am, where young people didn't show up or wasted their votes on a dead gorilla instead. It's wild and we could totally learn from this one.
* [School of Tears ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sby_6W_I0dQ) \- Jin, Suga, Rap Monster (AGAIN!!! Pre-Name Change. Pls don't fight me!)
   * When they say Bangtan has been representing the youth since the beginning, this song is the perfect one to point to. This is a pre-debut song that samples a Kendrick Lamar track and it speaks about the struggles of bullying. Not just the usual ""everybody is bullied"" stuff. No, this song opens up the reasoning why most kids don't open up or even speak up against school violence. It also shows the awareness of young people that school is just a smaller version of society and that it is just as harsh as the real world and we are all not naive. And the chorus? That's serious stuff. It doesn't blame one person. It blames us all as a whole and asks us to examine how we are all running and participating in the game called life.

***2013:***

* [No More Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBG5L7UsUxA) \- BTS
   * Of course we can't leave off our debut song. This is what started it all for the world. It portrayed Bangtan as the rebel youth, but there is an amazing point to this song. It is two fold. Of course, it acknowledges how the older generation's expectations of success and how young people, especially in South Korea, all have to be stuffed into boxes by the standards these expectations present. However, it also calls the youth to look at themselves. So, your dream isn't what your parents want or you don't have some big dream at all? Okay, well, that doesn't give you an excuse just to lay around and let someone else provide for you. Go be proactive! Get it done, whatever IT is for YOU. Not anyone else but you.
* [Adult Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POE9v1AXYDc) \- Jin, Suga, Rap Monster
   * I think this song captures the anxiety of youth perfectly. It's honest and raw, but put over a sweet melody. The elder members of Bangtan are expressing the fear they have transitioning from the teens to the adulthood years and they know for a fact they don't have it all planned out, but they want to do their best. It also presents a very real socio-political dilemma faced by a young Korean man about military service and the state of the nation.
* [OUTRO: LUV IN SKOOL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkIYr9vgmkM) \- Jin, Jimin, V, Jungkook
   * Because Bangtan's concept was hip-hop, the vocals weren't the superstar of the show in the very beginning. But, this song totally brings out the Bangtan Vocals earlier in their discography. Plus, it transitions super wonderfully into their *Skool Luv Affair* era and it's pretty great. I think Jin's vocals go unnoticed so often and this song is an ode to his solid vocals.
* [If I Ruled the World](https://youtu.be/jOr2emTHsZU) \- BTS
   * Okay, this song I fricking ADORE. Why? Because it shows the duality of Bangtan's youth. Yes, they are woke, but they are also young. They dream of owning fancy things and other unreasonable dreams. They dream of fame, fortune, ladies... This song shows  the side of youth that the adults see, the idealistic, naive and blissful side and it validates it. A young person doesn't always have to be burdened by the world 24/7. One of our powers is to still see the bright side, the opulent things and dream of them. In a similar vein:

***2014:***

* [Boy in Luv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8MfJg68oCs) \- BTS
   * This song is a love song. Straight up. No double entendre, no hidden meaning. And that's why I love it. (I'm using this instead of ""War of Hormone"" because it gets the point across without being as aggressive as ""WoH."" But that song is also honest about a side of youth: hormones and lust.) Bangtan not only provided a perspective on social issues from the eyes of the youth, they stayed true to pretty much all the concerns of a young person and romance is among those things.
* [ (Blanket Kick)](https://youtu.be/Cvz-50w3IiE) \- BTS
   * Another song about teenage romance. I swear by this song because it absolutely captures the innocence of puppy love and the ""kilig"" as we Pinoys like to say. It's a lovely and soft song and it's a bit of a break from their usual hip-hop sound. It's also a bit of a hiatus for the parent this list is meant for. I don't want to scare them off completely, and this sweet bop is a nice one for this purpose.
* [ (Spine Breaker)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klDj_wqaNO8) \- BTS
   * Alright, listen here,folks! I love spine breaker. It totally calls out all of the youth and puts everything into perspective. This [explanation by DKDKTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO7p4CLTSs) is super comprehensive. But, basically, it says to the young generation, ""Why are you demanding so many things from your parents? They break their backs to not only provide for your needs, but you *wants* as well. How selfish of you."" Of course, society has tough expectations, but you still have to work hard and stop being a baby, trying to be spoon fed all your life. I especially love Namjun's part where he address the fact that he can dress in expensive clothes because he made the money that went into buying it. He didn't beg his mom for it without working.
* [Can You Turn Off Your Phone (  )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaBqfBWTdxA) \- BTS
   * This song is great because we've all been on either side of this equation: either being on the phone all the time and ignoring those around us or asking someone to pay attention to us and not their screens. And it's also so interesting that this song comes from a group that everyone says was birthed by social media. Bangtan may be a group of the social media age, but they want real, genuine connections. And they've managed to be both connected through social media as well as through their music with their genuine mission and beliefs.
* [BTS Cypher PT.2: Triptych](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPCRkAo-Cc0) \- Rap Monster, j-hope, SUGA
   * This cypher? BLISS! If you've read my [analysis on the Rap Line](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8sx5c0/why_the_bangtan_rap_line_is_solid_an_analysis/), you'll know I love the All Force One performance of this cypher in particular. It's honestly super messy in terms of being a single song. It's literally three different styles, but it so totally shows off the vibe of each rapper and is an interesting showcase of Hoseok's foundation, before he fully found his sound (i.e. his mixtape.) This one is just full out for the jams, dude.

***2015:***

* [ (Moving On)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw198Sc011Q) \- BTS
   * This song is sweet and sentimental. It shows  the humanity of these seven young men who grew up together and learned together and became a family together. It is such a genuine song that shows how much the uncertainty of change affects them through the lens of their moving of dorms. But in the end, Bangtan concludes that they will be safe and happy as long as they have each other. I adore this song and it showcases their bond as a family unit so beautifully.
* [ (Dope)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM) \- BTS
   * ""Dope"" is not only a fun song but it does a thing that Bangtan is super good at: Making a song that a shallow listener could misconstrue as bragging, but is in reality, a lot deeper than it seems. They describe ""Bangtan Style"" as the ""hustle life."" The boys have worked to get to the celebrity status that they have. It is them reaping the benefits of countless sleepless nights and physical toil. And the costumes show the everyday hero and not superheros, making these professionals heros themselves. Plus, ""   ?"" (""Eoseo wa, Bangatanun choeumji?"")  ICONIC.
* [Whalien 52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1wuiLF04Rg) \- BTS
   * This song is fantastic because it expresses loneliness in a way that sounds kind of dumb but is actually super smart. Whalien is such a great metaphor. When you're an alien, no one understands you, you're from a different world and that is a lonely and sad existence. All you want to be is like everyone else. Then there's the whale portion. The 52 Hertx Whale is the loneliest whale in the world. It's whale song is on a different audio frequency as other whales and so it is destined to swim alone and unable to breed. Whalien. It sounds silly, but it absolutely expresses loneliness so well.
* [ (Silverspoon/ Crowtit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GsipdjoFmw) \- BTS
   * This song is so powerful. Of course, it's dangerous to put this on a list for my parents (please see Hoseok's hip thrusts), but the message is too strong to deny its time in the sun. This is another song about social pressures from the older generation and [DKDKTV made another solid video explaining the message of this song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4Qbh2rXFU&amp;t=60s) And the song does not give invalid excuses for asking the older generation to ease on the pressures. Instead, it points to the greater financial pressures, for example, that this generation must overcome, unlike the older generation.
* [One Night In a Strange City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPqsKM9oujk) \- BTS
   * This is totally not a song, but this skit is so organic and shows the dynamic of the boys so well. They are so at ease with one another and its so wonderful to listen in on what they're like on the day to day. And they're talking about the stresses unique to their line of work. The boys talk about how they struggled during their debut years and how this new era of ""I Need U"" is a dream compared to the old days. Listen to this and try to follow along with the translations. They're adorable talented men.

***2016:***

&amp;#x200B;

(2016 will be a long list. 2016 and *Wings* was an amazing year musically. Just watch out!)

* Basically ALL the solo songs. As in *ALL* of them. But, most notably:
   * [Lie](https://youtu.be/-ThId6ZWqsE) \- BTS
      * Jimin's solo is so musically complex and [Classical Musicians React's](https://youtu.be/vba2H4i_kJU) break down of this song musically just further pushes the genius of this song forward into the light. Jimin's words and haunting voice sing of social anxiety and putting on a mask for others to see and for one to hide behind. This song is *stunning.*
   * [First Love](https://youtu.be/S9ou2FCLWlQ) \- BTS
      * Out of all the members, Yoongi is the one who is there 100% for the music. He lives, eats and breathes *making* music. This song is so poetic and gentle and it is absolutely his superhero background story. This song is simple but so loaded. It shot me and I thanked it.
   * [Reflection](https://youtu.be/D78QseJtht8) \- BTS
      * I didn't get this song for a long long time. I used to avoid it because the chorus was empty and I was left to think in that space instead. And honestly, that is the genius of that song. It is called ""Reflection"" because it asks you to reflect. And if no other words could be said, let them be, "" I wish I could love myself.""
   * [MAMA](https://youtu.be/m5BMmuwcGtg) \- BTS
      * This song is so fun but so heart wrenching. It is about a child acknowledging his parents' sacrifice and thanking her for it. It is so hard, especially in this day and age, to find genuine filial love and respect and Hoseok's solo just puts his heart the chopping block. Its vulnerable in the most magical way.
   * [Awake](https://youtu.be/9UK3V5xhED0) \- BTS
      * This song is not as blatant in its meaning like the others and its interpretations are varied. But I feel like Jin is acknowledging the fact that most people didn't see him as en parre with the other members and that he's accepted it. And although he has, he also knows he has nothing to prove to anyone else but himself and he is happy for his brothers. But that's my interpretation.
* [! ! (    ) \[2! 3! (Still Wishing For More Good Days)\]](https://youtu.be/E30APZxHh4c) \- BTS
   * As far as songs written for the fans go, BTS' love letter to ARMY is so heart wrenching. It does not promise perfect days and verses such as SUGA's or j-hope's are candid about the hate that they as a group receive or the depression from the nature of their line of work. The song even starts with BTS saying they can not guarantee perfect and beautiful days. Yet, the promise to be by ARMY's side regardless of how terrible the world is to BTS or ARMY is so much truer and genuine than any boy band crooning about true love for every fan.
* [Wishing on a Star](https://youtu.be/ACt0r6kDV3g) \- BTS
   * This song is a gentle Japanese jam and it is so uplifting. I have to admit, I tend to avoid BTS' Japanese songs for no other reason other than that it is not their native language and their usual message is not in all the songs because it is harder to write meaningful lyrics in an unfamiliar tongue. But, this song is a reaffirmation for the sad and defeated and reminds us that we have no limit.

I hope this is the right place to do this, but as it says in the title, I'm looking to ship this 25cm Halloween edition Chimmy off to a warm home that will treasure him more than I can right now!

**Currently, I am selling for $25 (not including shipping).**

As context, I'm a college student and am trying to downsize on my BT21 collection (haha)! I bought him in October, but he really has been doing little beyond sit in my room and look cute. But I would like to sell him to someone who he will make happier! :)

As I'm sure it's important for anyone buying BT21 merch online, he is official, and the only caveat is that he is without tags. I got him from the LINE FRIENDS official Amazon right when they opened sales for these seasonal guys and I can show anyone a screenshot of proof if they're interested (PM me!). There is nothing wrong with him--he honestly looks brand new and just as cute--if anyone wants photos, I can definitely send those as well!

Let me know if you have any questions or interests in buying--thank you for reading my post! :\^)",0,1

She also told me her opinion, that maybe BigHit was debuting TXT so they would still have income after the bts years long hiatus and that they would probably do a lot of stuff in 2019.

Perfect pitch Perfect pitch, more formally known as absolute pitch, is the ability to sing or play any note with no former reference tone.

This means that if you were to ask someone with perfect pitch to sing an F on the spot, they would be able to reproduce it completely accurately with no guiding note.

Only about one in 10,000 people have perfect pitch. ([(Source)](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.classicfm.com/discover-music/music-theory/what-is-perfect-pitch-which-singers/)

Ive never been to a BTS show, or Wembley Stadium for that matter and I am kinda freaking out about the possibility of getting tickets.

I guess my biggest question is - has anyone else attended a concert at Wembley? Ive been to Wembley Arena, but not Stadium. Would it be worth getting VIP?

I have my heart set on VIP anyway, depending on the cost of course, but Im wondering just how close to the boys we would be? It would be awesome to see their faces and not rely on watching a screen the whole time :( either way, if Im lucky enough to get tickets I will be going but any advice would be great!

Hope everyone else expecting to buy tickets gets to go and have the best time ever &lt;3

I am working on a BTS fanfiction and need some help coming up with superpower ideas for the boys. These superpower would stem from their personalities: (For example, Suga could potentially have power immunity and not be affected by any mental/physical abilities, since in real life, he is unphased by zombies, jump scares, or pretty much anything. Hobi would have happiness/energy inducement. After all, the members constantly describe him as a happy, positive figure in their group and he is our Sunshine after all.)

It's right at the beginning of the podcast, so if you don't care about the rest of it (although I found the whole episode to be quite interesting) you could just listen to that bit. 

The presenters also bring up how BTS were one of the first K-pop bands to talk about mental health, pressure students face and social alienation and how their message is really resonating with people and even bringing actual change to South Korean society. 

You can find the podcast on Spotify/Itunes/etc or on their [website](https://www.vox.com/pages/podcasts).

For example, Joon, or BTS as a whole, could endorse eyeglasses frames or retailers, because everyone loves them in glasses. Yoongi could be in piano or music school ads. Jin could endorse kitchenware and cookware. Hobi could sell a million tubes of toothpaste. JK unleashed Downy Adorageddon....

Im actually a fairly new fan of BTS, I started stanning a few months ago back in October, so Im new to buying tickets for them and their shows.

They sell army bombs at the shows Im pretty sure, correct? How much are they? Are they cheaper online?

Do you have any tips on effectively buying tickets? Im going to be in school when they go on sale, I have the Ticketmaster app on my phone with my card info entered and ready. Any info on obtaining tickets would be helpful. 

Is it true that this is going to be a FIVE hour long show?? Thats crazy, but Im here for it 

Any other info you have or random tips would be so helpful. Other artists Ive seen, the tickets arent this cut throat to get. Im seeing Ariana Grande in July and the tickets were easy enough to obtain since I had presale.

First post here in this subreddit. So I was thinking tonight and it has been on my mind for a while. I have recently discovered that in the past, BTS members have made their own covers of popular radio songs such as the song 'We Don't Talk Anymore'. Which is pretty cool! I'm happy that they sing their own covers to these great songs. \^ \_\^

So it has been on my mind for a while now... **What if BTS did a cover of a popular children's song?** I was thinking that the children's song 'Shake Your Sillies Out' and the Fairly Odd Parent's song 'My Shiny Teeth and Me' would be great songs for them to make a cover of! 

Or just maybe... Maybe the opening of the children's show 'Paw Patrol'! That children's show is still pretty popular I believe and it would be fun to hear BTS sing the opening song from that show. =)

So what do you think ARMY? Got any awesome children's songs that you would love to see BTS make a cover of?I'm sure all of the wonderful ARMY moms in this subreddit that have children would love to share BTS with thier kids if they sang age appropriate songs directed at their kids' age group. At least I would really enjoy that if I was a mother. \^ \_\^

So any recommendations ARMY? I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with! \^ u\^",43,32

My most listened to artist on Spotify Wrapped was BTS this year. For the first few months since I started, BTS was what I listened to constantly (the amount of plays I probably have for BST and Cypher 4 is ridiculous). 

After I got more in KPOP, I started listening to a few songs from other groups and artists, but somehow I would always find my way back to listening to BTS. That's when I started listening to their older albums and also found their SoundCloud account. With the amount of songs they had, it was like there was a never-ending supply that I couldn't get tired of listening to. Other artists have this many songs or more, but BTS is the only artist whose discography I have listened to in full! Plus, I probably like 80-90% of songs that they have made. 

Still can't stop listening to their music and not sure if I ever will. Does anyone else feel this way? Has anyone slowly stopped listening to only their music? Has my love for BTS brainwashed me into listening to only them and blinded me to other music?

Her name is Rebecca Reusch and she's 15 years old. She went missing on February 18 on her way to her high school in Berlin. Police consider that she might have been the victim of someone with ill intentions. When they find her, she probably won't be alive.

Her case has been on the German news for days now. Today, a detailed description of her surfaced. The last thing she wore was a Love Yourself Rapmonster hoodie. 

I hope for her and her family that she'll be found soon, alive and well.
She's one of us.

I usually use sharpies on things like this but wanted to try something different. I used yarn for the raised surfaces to see how it would turn out and it's interesting,  but I think I'd go for a glue gun on the next attempt. I'm thinking about picking up a human mask to try recreating a Fake Love one.

I hope this counts. It's different but BTS' masks were the inspiration for the design. Not sure if it will show through though.

#Overview

ARMYPEDIA is a global scavenger hunt to ""archive of all your memories with BTS, each and every day for 2,080 days.""

You can post a memory for each of these dates on the website, but only when that date has been unlocked. The dates are unlocked by scanning QR codes hidden around the world (online and offline) and answering a quiz question. Only one ARMY has to find the code and unlock the date, after which anyone is able to post a memory corresponding to that date.

For more detailed information, see the tutorial on the [ARMYPEDIA website](https://www.armypedia.net/).

I hope this is the right place to do this, but as it says in the title, I'm looking to ship this 25cm Halloween edition Chimmy off to a warm home that will treasure him more than I can right now!

Currently, I am selling for **$25 (not including shipping).**

As context, I'm a college student and am trying to downsize on my BT21 collection (haha)! I bought him in October, but he really has been doing little beyond sit in my room and look cute. But I would like to sell him to someone who he will make happier! :)

As I'm sure it's important for anyone buying BT21 merch online, he is official, and the only caveat is that he is without tags. I got him from the LINE FRIENDS official Amazon right when they opened sales for these seasonal guys and I can show anyone a screenshot of proof if they're interested (PM me!). There is nothing wrong with him--he honestly looks brand new and just as cute--if anyone wants photos, I can definitely send those as well!

Let me know if you have any questions or interests in buying--thank you for reading my post! :\^)",2,29

Personally, BV is my favorite out of all the shows they produce because I feel like this their chance to get some downtime, even with cameras around and constantly in competition of who gets the most pocket money or sleeps in the biggest room lol. Not to mention, the crew really gives them time to bond and reflect as a group.

What do you guys think? Am I hoping for too much? Hahaha! Also what countries would you like to see them go to? I'm happy to say they've already visited my country when they did their 2017 Summer Package, but that was more for work than anything else. It was nice to see them enjoy themselves regardless.

**Musician of the Year, BTS**

We choose BTS, for the second consecutive year, as the Musician of the Year at the Korean Music Awards. This is the first time in the history of Korean pop music. However, if one regards such achievement as a byproduct of achievements from overseas, it is equivalent to denying the huge impact on the changes in the domestic music industry. BTS will remain as an important example showing what political and social influences pop music and messages in popular culture can exert across the borders. The least Korean team has born within the most Korean frame, and this is something, no matter what anyone says, that no team has ever done. To a musician who reflects the times and at the same time is equipped with musical quality, I gladly pay my tribute of praise.

Hee-a Park, Selection Committee

&amp;#x200B;

**Song of the Year, FAKE LOVE**

When talking about year 2018s Korean pop music, we wont be able to proceed without mentioning BTS. This is not simply because they topped the Billboard album chart and gains a huge popularity in the global market. This is because they are successfully communicating with consumers of the entire world, including Korea, through their music. Among their music, FAKE LOVE is a song that represents a venue of global communication and empathy through Korean music that BTS made in 2018. Along with the song, the cultural phenomenon that BTS created this year will remain as a special moment in the Korean pop music scene.

Gyutak Lee, Selection Committee

  

**Best Pop Song, FAKE LOVE**

The extraordinary narrative of LOVE YOURSELF series fully reveals itself in FAKE LOVE, the title track of LOVE YOURSELF Tear. The realization of the contradiction in Love without love for oneself is expressed as a cry of fake love. And the musical catharsis is doubles when it meets the agony of the musician who wants love to be perfect as it is. In addition, the message of painful realization embraces the innate melancholy of the Emo genre, faithfully securing the musical power of persuasion. There is no doubt that this is one of the most shinning achievements of K-pop in 2018 even if we leave the commercial achievement aside.

Hello! My friend and I have been wanting to get into making pins for a while and when the new tour was announced, I felt inspired by the poster\^\^ These are 1"" pins that will have a polished nickle/silver finish. The flower shape for the non-Japan dates was used in the poster and all of the colors were sourced from the poster! Plus the arrow is a combination of the arrow and heart symbols used on the poster as well.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of self-promotion but we're doing pre-orders right now for them so if anyone's interested, please let me know\^\^

Hopefully you all like them! Thanks and have a great day \\\^-\^/",1,1

I've done this as well. Maybe not infatuated with Namjoon, but so DRAWN to him that just opening one of his selfie tweets became this form of self harm where I looked at him and started hating myself for some strange reason. It's super unhealthy and completely antithetical to everything BTS stands for. Its like this strange contradiction within the fandom where we build ourselves up and start loving ourselves in front of the rest of the world, but then we tear ourselves down due to this weird dynamic between infatuated fan and artist.

I was wondering if this is a healthy thing, especially for younger fans? Weather you identify with this, and agree with it? Weather BTS had influenced your dating life in anyway?

Personally I would consider Namjoon my ""ideal type"", and I know we're mostly shown his ""good side"", but I understand, because he is human, he also has flaws. I've never dated, yet I use Namjoon's qualities as a guide for those I'm interested in, creating a standard (like you do with a celebrity crush).

I also do acknowledge the fact that Kpop works around the ideal of ""perfectionism"".

So, do you use BTS as a standard for potential partners?

I'm freaking out? Were arent rich, let alone well off, I think we won a scratch card or something or else how tf can we afford this? 

Holy shit. Im actually going.

This aside, a useful note,
If you in the UK and you get vip tickets, you can confirm them NOW and then pay on the 1st March. But you will get a ticket with a good view, the cheapest package is like 200 and its like 2nd tear seating, but at least you know you'll get a ticket, can actually see the boys and wont have too deal with the scalpers and ticket master carnage.

So since comeback is upon us I really wanted to make a dance post and talk about what kinds of choreography everyone was excited or expecting to see! But you can discuss anything, I just really love dance and talking about it (I am a dancer and BTS' dancing drew me in ) I'm going to post my wishlist for comeback but please share yours as well! 

#[Erica Klein](https://youtu.be/UuqLqi1hQ_Y?t=200) So I LOVE the Spring Day choreo and am dying for BTS to do more contemporary or contemporary-esque choreography and Erica Klein is probably my favourite contemporary choreographer, and favourite style right now, even though I'm more of a lyrical dancer by training. Her musicality is just off the charts and it's sooo intricate, I wish I could execute this like the dancers in her class (the last 2 groups especially oof). 

#[Delaney Glazer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6q4axTFMJI) Delaney is so insanely talented. I would LOVE for Hobi to dance to this, or something similar so badly. They both isolate their bodies so effectively and smoothly. 

#[Kyle Hanagami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW2yUrXXRTI) Kyle is a prodigy. And he is so versatile with his choreography. I would LOVE for him to collab with BTS or just for 3J to cover this choreography, especially JK. I think that JK has a great range of motion in his pelvis (lol) and has really great, smooth footwork, plus he loves Charlie Puth so it'd be perfect! 

#[Tessandra Chavez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KcCCHCwJU) Tessandra, like Kyle is so versatile and both her contempo and hiphop choreo is so good. She's also an Emmy winning choreographer! She just taps into emotions so well with her movements, I'm obsessed with the work she did for Blake's music video. 

#Miscellaneous
Probably will not happen in a music video but our dancers are so insanely talented I would love to see more of their skills! I am dying to see more of JK's breaking, more than the snippets than we've seen. And Hobi, I could watch him freestyle for hours. 

I also wonder if Jimin still kept his tumbling and flexibility, but his skillset is so unique! I don't know exactly what it's called, but in ballet it's a bit different, would love to see his revoltade again (I think it's a 540 maybe?). And this will never happen but it's part of my agenda hahaha but I'm dying for a Jimin tilt or a leg hold turn. I am convinced he can do one, he's more flexible than me and I've been dancing for 24 years. [Picture this, but standing and sideways](https://data.whicdn.com/images/188156317/superthumb.jpg?t=1436497689) please bighit....please 

Anyways sorry for the SUPER long post. Please share, I'd love to read them :)
