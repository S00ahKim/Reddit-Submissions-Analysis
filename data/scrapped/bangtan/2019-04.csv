Yes, it can be argued that we have an idea of who they are, but this is only as they present themselves to us through their music, the media, or fan events. We cling onto the tiny glimpses of their lives that we are exposed to, which for all we know could be fabricated, and begin to romanticize it. We use these minuscule moments of their lives and tiny details/quicks of their presented personalities as a basis for our standards.

Now that the dust has settled and the initial excitement around the BTS Mattel dolls has died down I thought this might be the perfect day for a grown-up, level-headed discussion around these wonderful collectibles. 
   
   

Personally I can't wait to buy them all - I'm actually thinking of buying two sets just so that I can keep one set in their respective packaging (I mean let's be real here, these are gonna go up in value crazy high) and have one set for actually playing with! 

Does anyone know if the dolls are all the same size? I really want to swap out the outfits and make my own AU IDOL bangtan! 

Anyway, what are your plans for the dolls? How many of them are you getting? As I said, I'm probably getting two sets, since they're collectibles, really well made (thanks Mattel &lt;3) , and I'm such a superfan. 

Looking forward to your replies!

Im talking about lyrics that still make sense which then led you to believe they were actually real, not lyrics such as (for a very random example)   /    which is used in a lot of songs and sounds like Im so gay in English (because in the context of the song, it wouldnt make sense) or JK in Idol when it sounds like he says I love my family my kids and my wife because even though it still make sense, its not likely to be something hed actually be saying, you know?

I dont tend to really search BTS lyrics whether it be the official ones or English translations but last night I found myself watching a lyric video for Dimple and was shocked when I found out what the actual lyrics were, because Ive heard it 94834 times before yet never had any idea and it got me thinking, who else doesnt realise certain lyrics are English or vice versa (thinking they're English when they're actually Korean)?

Im annoyed because I literally have so many examples but cant think of many off the top of my head right now so, Ill just share the ones that come to mind first.

**1).** Dimple  I thought the whole chorus was in Korean but its not, the lyrics are 

*""  illegal (illegal)*  
*  oh yes*  
*so I call you illegirl (illegirl)""*

I had no idea they were saying the word illegal / illegirl or so I call you illegirl so when I found out, my mind was literally blown and now I cant stop singing it, like really, this is the best discovery ever, I love it.

**2).** This is the biggest one for me (I still sing it even now) and Ive never seen anyone else mention it but in Like, in Yoongis verse he says *    backspace* but I always thought he was saying she looks so good on her back, space. Every time I heard it I thought he was making a sexual reference but turning it into wordplay, like saying she looks good on her back but then turning the back into backspace, like on a keyboard? Probably made more sense in my head. Anyway, needless to say I was disappointed when I realised he actually wasnt saying that and Id been getting the lyrics wrong the whole time ***(but that sign wont stop me because I cant read).***

**3).** Jins Epiphany  Im the one I should love in the line Im the one I should love in this world? No idea. I thought it was Korean apart from the in this world part, until I saw the lyrics and realised it wasnt.

**4).** Paradise  Such a supporting and uplifting song filled with lines such as *stop running for nothing my friend* and so when I thought I heard the lyrics live in the moment, hold it in the chorus it made complete sense to me and I was a happy lil bunny, however, that is not what they were saying. I thought they were saying * live in the moment, hold it  * but the actual lyrics are *     * aka, not English at all. Much disappoint as I thought live in the moment was cute.

Also on the subject of Paradise, the first part of Sugas verse when he says I don't have a dream sounds like he says Ill never drink.

**5).** Hobis verse in Idol  not a clue. I know Im not alone in this because I saw someone else comment on the music video saying they had no idea he was speaking English until they searched the lyrics and I was thinking *me too girl, me too.* The lyrics are -

*Face off  , ay*  
*Top star with that spotlight, ay*  
*  *  
*  Anpanman*

but I just thought the whole thing was Korean (minus the Anpanman because \*Victoria Justice voice\* I think we *all*understood that part).

**6).** Saving the best til last because this one still gets me. You know the Mic Drop Steve Aoki remix aka, the *English* version of the song? Yeah, I had no idea it was English.

I dont know why  Id heard the song a couple of times and wasnt really into it so I just forgot about it. One day literally months later I was on a BTS music video binge and decided to watch Mic Drop because as I wasnt really into it, Id only seen the music video probably once before - there was an option to turn on subtitles (which I did, because BigHit usually never provide us with such things) and its safe to say when I saw English lyrics appearing on my screen and realised they fit with what was being sungI practically fell off my chair. Its so much easier to hear lyrics properly when you have them in front of you and so suddenly I was like wait.90% of this is English. This is literally an English version of Mic Drop. I hadnt heard *any* of the English before yet now the lyrics were in front of me I could hear all of it. Anyway, I love the song now and my mind = blown. Up until that point I thought BTS didnt have any English versions of their songs but alas, I was mistaken.

Some of these misinterpretations could be chalked down to pronunciation but I also think its a case of being so used to hearing (and expecting) Korean that if I dont instantly recognise a lyric as being English, I just assume it isnt and I never check to see otherwise.

In my opinion their pronunciation is usually pretty good which is why I wouldnt say its always the reason for misheard lyrics - for me in terms of that it actually tends to happen with Joon a lot because of his (deliberate, I believe) pronunciation of certain English words that therefore make them sound, wellnot English. So many times Ill be reading lyrics and thinking wait, *thats* what he said? It was English the whole time? I would basically have no idea unless Id read the lyrics.

Also while were on the subject, as we all know, some BTS songs contain swearing - primarily using the word shit and the f bomb but unless you actually read the lyrics, you cant hear it when listening to the song because the pronunciation sounds nothing like the actual word and the swearing itself is used subtly within the lyrics. For example Intro: Never Mind, Like, Whalien 52 all contain swearing (f bomb included) but have these songs been marked as explicit? Nope. I find it really funny because of course, these songs are on Spotify and other platforms yet theyre not marked as explicit, literally I believe due to the fact that you cant hear the swearing due to the pronunciation. I always find that amusing. If there's an actual reason as to why they're not marked as explicit someone please feel free to share but otherwise, I'm going to continue enjoying the fact it seems like they can pretty much get away with saying most things and not get noticed (in Western countries anyway, I'm aware of the bans in Asia).",164,93,False,self,,,,,

[Hey Reddit community! ](https://i.redd.it/agsapfqf3qp21.jpg)

We are (finally!) releasing new episodes of our bts-centric podcast - *First Time With BTS?* \- after a begrudgingly long hiatus. Begrudging because as much as we enjoy researching and writing BTS analysis, our responsibilities pushed this fun hobby to the back burner. But now were back and were very excited to share the news. We would love it if you all gave it a listen and even shared it with your friends (kpop lovers and non-lovers alike!).

[Our comeback episode](https://soundcloud.com/bangtanpodcast/episode-10) is a walk through of bangtan news and events that went down during each month of our hiatus. So if youre feeling nostalgic or ready to revisit the last fall and winter within Armyville, definitely check it out.

The upcoming episodes will be thematic, offering discussions on trends within the fandom (eg., shipping), analyzing past concepts (eg., Wings), listing some of BTSs greatest hits, and more. If any of that sounds appealing to you, stay tuned! 

To stay updated on FTwBTS? news, follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bangtanpodcast) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bangtanpodcast/) \~ @bangtanpodcast

After listening, feel free to write us feedback here!

Steve Aoki  is one of the busiest people in the music industry, hands down. In  fact, he's one of the busiest people...period. When he's not writing and  producing an incredible amount of music, filming music videos or  touring over 200 days out of the year, he's designing clothing, curating  mixes, and even traveling for fun, making sure to see the places he  visits while playing shows in almost every country of the world.

The musician has been vocal for years about the fact that he loves  Japan more than any other place in the world, and whenever he can, he  finds ways to incorporate the country's culture and style into  everything he does. Now, Aoki has taken his love of showing the world  what makes Japan so great to another level by launching a new weekly  podcast in connection with All Nippon Airlines. In the program, he  shares what he's discovered about Japan, convincing anyone who listens  to want to visit the nation.

I spoke with Aoki about his new venture, his latest collaborations  with some of the biggest names in K-pop, and what he believes the future  holds for the growing genre.

**Hugh McIntyre**: Congrats on the  new podcast! I'm happy to see it come out because it seems like  something different that was missing from the field. Tell me a bit about  it!

**Steve Aoki**: To be honest, I've  always wanted to do a talking podcast. I've gotten close. I've had  meetings about doing it, but never got to the finish line with it. Ive  had my music podcast been going on for years now, I think for like 300  or 400 episodes or something. Its awesome because I wanted to do a  talking podcast and I wanted to have a focus specifically on the podcast  around Japan.

That's when I teamed up with ANA \[All Nippon Airways\], and I'm like,  ""Well, this is amazing, because I really get to pour my heart out about  my favorite place in the world, and dissect why I do."" In interviews  whenever people ask me, ""What's your favorite place in the world?"" I  give them a 20 minute answer about why I love Tokyo. Now I can go into  detail and really divulge all the different aspects of why Japan is my  favorite place in the world. The food, the art, the music, the fashion.  It's a lot of fun putting it all together.

**McIntyre**: So you've talked about this for a while, but it never came together. What made this the right time? What made it happen now?

**Aoki**: What made it happen now?  Just conversations, just talking about it. For one, I've been working  with ANA for three years now. We work closely together. The main idea is  to get people excited about coming to Japan. We both have a shared  interest of how much we love the Japanese culture. It's the same way  with my friends. I always tell them, ""You need to go to Japan. If  there's any place in the world that you have to go to, youve got to go  to Japan for all these different reasons.""

We've had a really great, healthy  relationship working together. We were talking, and they were like, ""You  know, we should do a podcast. You can really go into detail about why  Japan is one of the best places in the world."" So they allowed me to do  it. They loved the idea, and we were off and running. I was like, ""Okay,  get me a couple mics to set up in my studio, and let's knock this out.""

**McIntyre**: I am happy to see you  continuing to talk about how much you love Japan and your Japanese  heritage. What does it mean to you, and why does it mean so much that  you want to keep investigating and talking about it?

**Aoki**: Well, I think when you  really think about, ""Why do you keep talking about the same thing,"" it  boils down to When I was a kid and I really loved something, all I  wanted to do was tell my friends, tell my mom and dad, tell whoever I  was around. Like, ""Hey, you gotta see this!"" And I remember when was I  was just a teenager, when I first found out about music in a way where  it became my life, all I wanted to do was be an evangelist about music.  It's why I started a band, that's why I put on shows, that's why I made a  zine. You know?

The whole idea is to share things that you love, and I am that same  kid now with things that I absolutely love. And I feel like I've been  pretty successful at that idea of sharing, the idea of connecting. As a  DJ, which is something that takes up a large part of my time, that's  essentially what I'm doingsharing music that I absolutely love and  presenting it in a certain way. It makes it a unique show for people.

So in this case, we're talking about Japan. And Japan isn't just a  great place, it's my number one favorite place in the world. I've gone  across the entire world. I've gone to so many different cities, and I  constantly travel. I'm not jaded, and I constantly want to get back on  the road. I want to travel the world. And I always want to see, almost  to make a test, is there a better place than Japan in my mind? And  really, as much as I love the rest of the worldand I do, and I love  experiencing new environments, new culturesJapan always sinks into my  heart and my inspiration. It really informs me as a creator, whether I'm  in the fashion space or making music in the studio, it really informs  me on the inspirational level.

**McIntyre**: You released your  last album about six months ago, and since then, you've already released  singles not featured on it. What keeps you putting music out at that  pace?

**Aoki**: You know, first of all,  I'm obsessed. I have an obsession. The way I am, just like those same  kids that are masters of Fortnite, I'm obsessed, working hard at my  craft and making it better.

The thing about being a producer is  that there's always so much more room; you can never be the best.  There's so much more room to grow, so many different ways to reinvent  the wheel, so many different ways to create a song and make it sound not  just really good for you, but really good for the culture. Because the  songs that really hit, the songs that become the singles, they get  millions and millions of streams and potentially get on the radio, those  songs aren't just great songs. They are songs that are indicative of  what culture wants. So you're able to make songs that the culture wants  to hear and aim for, right? And that is really hard to do, right? So the  one thing that you can do, and the one thing that I've learned in my  career, is that you have to be diligent, you have to be resilient. You  have to keep putting music out there constantly

Because I'm not Calvin Harris, who  spends time making one song and every song he puts out is like, ""Boom!"" A  worldwide smash hit, changing culture. My way, my process is constantly  going into the studio. The best part about whenever I'm in the studio  with a different artist is that they bring a different kind of  inspiration. They bring a different kind of toolkit, a different kind of  process that changes everything for me. It actually allows me to be a  much more diverse, dynamic producer, and I learn so much from that

That's why I work with K-pop artists,  Latin artists, EDM producers, country artists, rock bands, and hip-hop  artists. I really love that diverse flow of musical freedom and being  able to go into that. And it's a lot of fun too, to be able to work with  some of these artists that are responsible for shifting culture. To be  in a room with them is already pretty awesome, so I take each song, each  project very critically. I try to do the best I can and hope for the  best. When I release a song, it's a hit to me, and that's all I need to  feel. It doesn't have to be a No. 1 hit. That's just how the Steve Aoki  process works. It's about putting out all kinds of music all the time.  Some of them become worldwide smash hits, and some of them don't, and  that's okay.

**McIntyre**: Speaking of K-pop, your collaboration with Monsta X, the English version of [Play It Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7IXKQzmpK4) was released recently.

**Aoki**: Yep!

**McIntyre: I was listening to  that earlier. You've partnered with a few K-pop acts fairly recently.  The song with BTS blew up! What fascinates you so much about K-pop?**

**Aoki: I mean, it's what  fascinates me about Japan. There's not just one particular thing. What's  happening in Korea, the K-pop culture, it's also a very complex  culture. There's a lot of different things going on that make it so  exciting, and I think what's really exciting about it, is, one, it's a  non-dominant culture. It's a culture that you don't see in the  mainstream light. I love that.**

**Asian culture is taking the world by  storm, and without any real help from these larger institutions, these  radio platforms that are pretty much the number one way for pop music to  become pop culture. Right? So you have artists like BTS who, whether a  radio station plays them or not, they will have millions upon millions  of fans in countries all across the world. And they don't need the  larger institution to be able to be like, ""Well, if you don't play their  song on the radio, it's not going to pop in this country."" It already  did, and the fans already are circulating the music.**

**McIntyre: Yeah.**

**Aoki: That already itself is  just a phenomenon that I'm so amazed by, impressed by, inspired by. And I  mean, you look into the culture, when you dive into K-pop, it's a  fascinating culture that I think anyone would be interested to look  into. But you have to discover for yourself; it's not thrown at you like  American pop culture when you turn on a television, or when you turn on  the radio. You're not going to hear a Korean song on the radio  yet...yet.**

**McIntyre: Yeah, maybe one day soon.**

**Aoki**: **Yeah. Yeah, and what's  exciting is that the way people listen to music, and the way people find  out about artists has changed so much in the past few years. That yes,  theres a high likelihood there will be a song sung in Korean played  back to back with Post Malone and Ariana Grande on mainstream radio. And  I think BTS will be the artist that will be up there.**",38,89,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Jin- Artemis (Goddess of the hunt, the wilderness, virginity, the moon, archery, childbirth, protection and plague). Independent and have a bunch of admirers following them around.

&amp;#x200B;

Yoongi- Poseidon (God of the seas, water, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and horses). Can be both calm and passionate. Make the earth shake with tongue technology. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hoseok - Zeus (King of the gods and ruler of Mount Olympus). Part of the original lineup and natural leader. 

&amp;#x200B;

Namjoon- Demeter (Goddess of the harvest, fertility, agriculture, nature and the seasons). ""Organic"" king who enjoys watching the leaves fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimin- Dionysos (God of wine, the grape vine, fertility, festivity, ecstasy, madness and resurrection). Drinking fairy and party animal.

&amp;#x200B;

Taehyung- Hermes (Messenger of the gods; god of travel, commerce, communication, borders, eloquence, diplomacy, thieves and games). Social butterfly and king of cheating at games. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jungkook- Apollo (God of light, the sun, prophecy, truth, inspiration, poetry, music, arts, medicine, healing, and plague). Multitalented, an artist at heart and I like the idea of him having Jin as a twin.

So while were anxiously awaiting new BTS music I felt like starting this thread, which is meant to share good music from all over the world! 


BTS has songs of many different genres, and sometimes personally I can think *gosh, I love this song so much, I wish there were more like it!* With spotify, soundcloud, and youtube there is a whole wide world of songs out there but it can be a little bit daunting to try and find a specific type of song. 


SO! Please share your recommendations! All languages allowed, but try and link them to a BTS song (with a bit of explanation)! Can be old songs or new songs. Recommending an artist in general is allowed but please recommend at least one specific song! 


Ill start-  
If you like Outro:Tear you might like Formidable by Stromae. Its in French. It doesnt go as hard as Tear but it has that kind of dramatic rap vibe. 

If you like lowkey songs like Promise and Scenery, you might like Agnes Obel, for example The Curse. She sings in english and has that sit-down-with-a-cup-of-tea-on-an-autumn-day feeling.

Fan Theories Place K-Pop Favorites At Anna Wintour's Exclusive Event,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/b8tjbq/190402_newsweek_will_bts_perform_at_the_2019_met/,FakeuLarb,1554266019,"[https://www.newsweek.com/will-bts-perform-2019-met-gala-fan-theories-place-k-pop-favorites-anna-1383721](https://www.newsweek.com/will-bts-perform-2019-met-gala-fan-theories-place-k-pop-favorites-anna-1383721)

The Met Gala is one of New Yorks most exclusive, elusive events, and  though the guest list is held under lock and key, BTS fans are  theorizing the K-Pop group may be in attendance. Not only have members  of the BTS army worked out a possible BTS sighting on the Met steps, but  theyve also explained its possible the group will perform at the  gala.

While BTSs appearance or invite is unconfirmed, there are a  handful of reasons why fans have come to think they may be attending.  The first comes with two U.S. tour dates scheduled ahead of the gala.  The Met Gala is held on the first Monday in May every year. This year,  it will be May 6. BTS is scheduled to perform two concerts in Los  Angeles on May 4 and 5, meaning theyll be free and in the United States  on May 6. Though its a plane ride away, celebrities have flown longer  distances in a day to attend coveted events. Their next scheduled event  will be a tour stop in Chicago on May 11, as confirmed by their  websites diary schedule.

Another hint to fans of the group, which  they revealed on Twitter, is the groups relationship to Baz Luhrmann.  Luhrmann was the head of planning of the 2018 galas musical  performances. The coveted creative, best known for his writing,  production and directing, teased a collaboration with BTS on Twitter in  October. A **Reddit** thread spearheaded by BTS fans breaks down the  possibility of the collaboration ending with a Met Gala show. An  alternate theory claims the band may be branding with Chanel, as theyve  been sporting the classic designer frequently and Luhrmann has his own  ties to the fashion house.

The last clue cites a different fashion  house: Gucci. Gucci has its own hand in the 2019 Met Gala as this  years sponsor, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The brands  creative director, Alessandro Michele, spoke highly of this years  theme, inspired by Susan Sontags 1964 essay Notes on ""Camp. Fans have  seen BTS relate closely to Gucci recently, from the group wearing the  brand to Guccis persona themed fashion show in 2019. Persona is the  theme of BTSs upcoming album, Map Of The Soul: Persona, as well as a  track title on the album.

Amount of tickets left on Stubhub:

LA day 1           - 6509 tickets
LA day 2           - 7784 tickets
Chicago day 1 - 5081 tickets
Chicago day 2 - 7514 tickets

And this is ONLY from Stubhub. Ticketmaster, Vibidseats etc. Are selling many tickets as well!!

If you couldn't grab tickets, NOW is your chance. The new album is around the corner, new music and new performances are coming. It's gonna be worth it. I don't want BTS to perform in an empty stadium so let's give them a packed show Armys :)

Given how many people are anticipating a hiphop album or predicting hiphop as the major genre for this album,  I was wondering if people will be disappointed if it doesn't turn out that way.

I for one have a theory going on due to which I wish this turns out to be an hiphop album but honestly I am fine with whatever genre they decide to tackle because I don't really have a strong preference for any genre.",56,85,False,self,,,,,

151,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2019-4-4,2019,4,4,7,b94ijd,self.bangtan,190403 New Persona theme + a few other things,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/b94ijd/190403_new_persona_theme_a_few_other_things/,Eren_,1554329674,"Hello, folks! 

We hit size limit with the last theme (which was actually from YNWA era wew) so we had to edit a new one. There arent many drastic changes as I tried to make it as close to the old one as possible, and a few things are back.

#I. New Theme

---

As those of you on desktop must've noticed, we just changed the subreddit's theme to match the new album. I apologise for the delay.

For those of you on mobile, this is what the new theme looks like:

* [Day mode](https://i.imgur.com/9RA5vqM.png);
* [Night mode](https://i.imgur.com/t2dUfYk.png).

To switch to night mode, you will need to be on the classic/old reddit and have [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) installed. [Here is how you can turn it on](https://i.imgur.com/i3HkTj8.gif).

Reminder that you can check out all past themes in our [layout archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/layouts) in the wiki.

-

**^Friendly ^tip**^: ^You ^can ^go ^to ^the ^subreddit's ^frontpage ^by ^clicking ^on ^the ^""r/bangtan"" ^in ^the ^header. ^For ^reddit's ^frontpage, ^click ^on ^the ^big ^VAN ^Snoo ^:\^)

#II. Redesign

---

If youre using the redesign this announcement is useless and your reddit experience is slower compared to when using legacy/old reddit unless you have a good computer.

If you are currently using reddits redesign and wish to see how it looks like, you can always add *old* before the URL, as in *old.reddit.com*, [like so](https://old.reddit.com/r/bangtan).

If you are currently using the redesign and wish to turn it off, just go to *User Settings* &gt; *Scroll to the bottom* &gt; *Opt out of the redesign*. If you cant find it, [heres a .GIF to make it easier](https://i.imgur.com/QAGLfCM.gif). 

We have a lot of resources added to the subreddit through CSS on legacy/old reddit which users of the redesign dont really get to see thanks to limitation presented by it. Mods can only add a certain number of links to the menu provided by the redesign. We have an unlimited number of links in the sidebar and menu bar on old reddit, though. It also doesnt allow us to add older or rarely used flairs to the sidebar. Things like guides wont be seen unless you know to search for them.

If you get an issue on the redesign well probably be unable to help you since all of us use the old one.

Things like emojis and special banners also cant be seen on the redesign since it uses CSS. Thanks, reddit.

#III. Weekly Rooms

---

Reminder that since reddit only allows us to have two stickied threads on the frontpage, this is how you can find our weekly rooms:

- [Legacy/Old Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/R7DiMV9.png)
- [Redesign/New Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/Qf07Cj9.png)
- [Official Mobile App](https://i.imgur.com/uNoSGUI.gif)
- [3rd Party App](https://i.imgur.com/h1w1dBa.gif)

If you need tips on other mobile apps *(reddits official app lacks-- surprise--some functionality)*, [here are a few](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/mobileapp).

#IV. Emojis

---

Our emojis are back! If you missed expressing yourselves with those big things, you have them once again now. If youre on mobile or the redesign, [this is how they look like](https://i.imgur.com/gaNjpgm.png).

You can learn how to use them [on this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/emojis).

While mobile users wont be able to see them, you can still add them in and theyll be seen on desktop.

#V. Rotating banners

---

Were bringing you all the oppadeul but no unnies, unfortunately ~~(heh get it)~~. We had this during WINGS but it didnt work with the past theme for some reason. Now we have all seven members changing whenever you refresh. Theres an OT7 banner included, but its really hard to land on it. If you do, get hype! You just saw a shiny pokmon.

**Note**: This has been turned off as of now until I can get it to work properly again.

#VI. A Few Reminders

---

What I like about them is that: they themselves make their own music, legitimately sing during their performances even while dancing, are given the option to come into work whenever they please because their company, BigHit, wants them to have as much freedom as possible and understands that the members of BTS are only human, and the music and concepts they make is honestly brilliant, refreshing, and mind-opening to me.

I like BTS because they are not afraid to express themselves and are able to do so because they and their company wants change within the Kpop industry and within the world.

I like BTS and the fact that they are each seven strong individuals that are humble despite all of the money that they have because of how low they started in their once miniscule company.

I like BTS and the love and support they give to their fans and when their fans, their Army, returns the love and support, they become humbly flustered and act as though they we are the ones who gifted them with success and glory but they are the ones that changed and opened the hearts of many and even gave people the hearts that they needed.

I really like BTS because of the strong messages they give to people through not only their music but even in the things they do rather than basic songs like ""Oh baby I want you to be mine"" or other such themes like one-sided love or lovey dovey shit from the Kpop industry in general.

I'm sorry but it just seems like other male musical groups within the Kpop industry focus more on enforcing their masculinity and being basic when they sing songs like ""You have a sexy body so therefore that makes me want to claim you as mine, girl"". And the girl groups are typically like ""Well you're gonna have to catch me if you can but I'm a hard catch because I'm TOTALLY not like all the other girls"" as if in response to the boy groups and that shit gets really fuckin' repetitive and therefore boring to me. I'm not saying that all other kpop groups are like this nor am I trying to convince you that you should drop them and listen to only BTS. I'm saying that generally, within the Kpop Industry, companies tend to enforce said basic concepts or themes upon the idols that work for them. But when it comes to BigHit, it seems more like BigHit works for BTS rather than the other way around, and their wonderfully written and composed songs and elaborate concepts that come out of both BigHit and BTS that both group and the company actually work together to create are what I am really inspired by and a big reason why I love and support them.

This is why I only really listen to BTS when it comes to ""kpop"" because their songs are more about self reflection, the struggle of being under authority in society, especially in South Korean society, mental issues, and simply being able to not love someone when you are struggling to love yourself, like, THAT SHIT HITS HOME AND WHAT WE ALL REALLY NEED IN LIFE.

That is why I like BTS.

If you are too afraid to express why you like BTS when somebody asks you, then that is because you don't want to be harshly judged. People can think what they want and if they are legit finding it disgusting or ""cringe"" that you like BTS for some personal reason, then they are simply either misinformed or not informed at all, so let them know why you like BTS.",1,4,False,self,,,,,

None of them was able to provide a straight and coherent answer, one popular Korean Youtube blogger implied that it's a combo of some sort of a mask applied the night before that I guess super hydrates the skin (and would legit make my dermatologist go on a rant) + either a tint/BB cream/foundation with some sort of a sparkly content (to my surprise, they've used Estee Lauder as opposed to some magic k-beauty product) + a lil bit of a highlighter. I am just really looking for a straightforward answer, whereas all the resources I went through were ambiguous and wishy-washy.

Still, I've tried all that stuff before, including the Western brand mentioned as well as so many others, and none of that stuff created the effect of a naturally looking skin with that dewy-innocent-Jiminie final look, it still doesn't even get close to that. I mean every single one of them has the look but Jimin's the classic in my humble aesthetic opinion, not a stan but gotta honestly point out the beauty where it obviously shines.

Would really appreciate any advice/tips on what is that mysterious product/routine that makes their skin looks so naturally glowing &amp; I'd even say some of them, as young as they are, look even younger due to that effect, especially in the last two recent eras, including the recently released Persona concept photos.

I know some people might say their skin is naturally well-taken care of and I agree, but as a veteran viewer of some of their videos, even on those days when their no-makeup skin looks pretty normal and relatable, i.e., dare I say, I can see the imperfections or, in the visible absence of the there of, the sleepless nights and months of constant overworking are clearly present on the exhausted faces, metaphorically speaking. And no, it's not because ""they ate too much ramen the night before"" (as a young culturally sensitive scientist, I just can't even when I hear that).

But then they spend a moment or two with their magic makeup artists and comeback totally different men! Like, the imperfections are gone yet unlike the Western makeup, the efforts of the makeup artist to hide the imperfections are not visible and the infamous dewy-innocent-Jiminie-glow look is on, like, how???? 

P.S. I also noticed sometimes their makeup artists refresh their faces by using really small brushes and applying possibly some sort of a concealer very punctiliously but not sure, does anyone know why they do that? It looks like their painting a Louvre-level masterpiece, I wonder if those very pointed brush strokes also contribute to the dewy look but not sure, any advice/ideas would be much appreciated!",30,18,False,self,,,,,

Id love a casual, raw format with maybe an autobiographical concept: a look into each of their personal encounters with hip-hop, how they met, their perspective on trainee life, etc.

The corresponding MV(s) could be representative of that, maybe with some humorous or serious re-enactments.

I kind of got this idea from their EW interview, when RM was talking about how he, Suga, and J-Hope went to see Eminem together. Theyve also known each other the longest right? A lot of years of history to explore. Id be so into that sort of thing, especially if it means a peak into how they came up, dealt with various struggles and disagreements amongst themselves.

Since Im such Rap Line trash I would adore an EP or collaborative mixtape from them, but I cant see them wanting to do that or even having the time to do so while OT7 Bangtan is presently busy doing their thing. 

Maybe if BTS was on a break or hiatus for military reasons, but anyway

Id love to hear what you think. So many groups form subunits for creative and/or practical reasons and Im sure Im not the only one whos curious about BTS subunits outside of covers and the muster performances.

Ahead of BTSs performance on SNL next week, I decided to make as a way for everyone to get acquainted with the show.

First off, the show.

SNL is a sketch comedy show that airs live on Saturday night at 11:30p/10:30c on NBC. Since Season 42, SNL has been airing live in the United States coast to coast.

Now, most of the contents of the show are just comedy sketches. Generally, musical performances happen after the first act (generally after 12a) and around 12:45a. That means, the boys will be onscreen for 10 minutes of the total 90-minute runtime.

That being said, audience members of the show tend to be a mix of general fans of the show and fans of the host and/or musical guest. The audience is basically the gauge on whether or not the comedy the cast members perform work. (To repeat the point: This is a comedy show.)

Second, TICKETS!

Tickets for the show are acquired through two ways. 1) The ticket lottery that happens in August. Or 2) the standby line, which most people who watch the show get their tickets from.

Since the lineup for upcoming shows arent typically made public until the actual date of the show, most people tend to go to the standby line. The standby line for SNL is on the 48th Street side of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.

The security at NBC are aware of the influx of the BTS army that might line up, so the earliest day you can be on the standby line next week is WEDNESDAY.

Generally, its recommended to bring a friend with you in the line. (So that you can have someone save you a place in line while you buy food.) For the most part, you will be lining up until 7AM on Saturday. (This is when the NBC pages will be handing out the ticket vouchers.)

If you get a ticket voucher, you cam choose between the 8PM dress rehearsal or the 11:30PM live show. The dress rehearsal runs until 10:15. It typically has more comedy sketches and it will be the first time the musical guest performs in front of a live audience.

Also, the tickets are FREE. But it means you need to play by the rules of NBCs security.

Which leads me to the third thing: general decorum.

If you ever get tickets to the show, please be wary that you arent the only people in the audience. You may be in it for BTS, but most of the other people are in it for the comedy.

[Heres a typical musical performance on SNL.](https://youtu.be/f98Ei9wjWlg)

That means, you cant really do fanchants while the boys are performing. Also, take note that most of the seats in the studio are on the balcony and there are crew members under the balcony.

Have fun. Laugh at the sketches.

I hope this covers the stuff you may not know about SNL.",58,155,False,self,,,,,

Is BTS one of the first groups to rule Twitter in this way or are most kpop fanbases on Twitter this large? Have other boy bands like One Direction been this popular as well a few years back?

My newest/ most absurd are that raplines mixtapes are canon in some respect, just thinking about Tokyo, Daydream and Interlude: Dream

My other one was that Jin is actually the one that is sick or hospitalized instead of jihope, and all of the storyline is him imagining them while the others cant get through to him that theyre actually okay - and that Tae can somehow communicate to Jin in another way that no one else can.

It's  the middle of the night here when I got my epiphany that it's April  2019 - it's officially the month and the first week was when I went through a Cooky hole and have  never resurfaced to this place called earth. 

Anyhoo,  so how did my first step as an ARMY begin? I have shared that too many  times here how I have come to loving BTS. This time I wanna share about  the SECOND step: how I found fellow ARMYs.

First  I went to Amino. Oh gawd full of kids and cringe worth full of  cringe... I luckily entered a chat that said Adult ARMYs Join Here, and I  found H and A. They are THE BEST. I LOVE chatting with them. We have a  Telegram group chat where we ofc gush about BTS and I cry about how they  got to see BTS live while I see them through Vlive only .  A special shout out to A for being as petty as me . Also looking  back, I can't believe how easily I have come to trust them and able to  talk about things with them. We all have so many relatable problems  lulz. H and A - I purple you guys - thank you for coming to my life and  cheering me further. &lt;3 But it made me sad that I couldn't meet them. They were somewhere faaaar away from my place.

So here comes third step: Finding Offline ARMYs

Oh  lulz. So I have close friends who are unfortunately arent ARMYs or even  fans of kpop. Among them my friend N knew about BTS (!) but not a fan  of kpop or bts. (Oh, a sidenote I didn't know about BTS. The last I  heard about kpop was Gangnam Style, which I disliked and still dislike.  #sorrypsy)

So  by that time I had joined reddit and complaining about the lack of  Dubai ARMYs. {Side note again: If YOU LIVE IN DUBAI, DM ME PLEASE. ALSO  PLEASE BE AN AGE OVER 21.}

Thats when I met  u/monaesque! Or well she contacted me first! Honestly its really funny  how she remembered me even tho I didnt keep in touch with her after the  first hello. Lulz, sorry M! She visited Dubai during December bearing BT21 stuff (thank you for  them and saving me shipping costs!) and oh man it was the best 2 days of my ARMY life. I can't tell  you how easy it was to talk to her. And looool we went to eat Korean  food, literally 4-5 times customers around us left while we were still there chatting about thing and  laughing our asses off  . BTW I have a video of her failing to eat the Suga-samgyeopsal way. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, the journey of being an ARMY continues. I am sure you have similar stories to tell. I would like to know your ARMYversary date! Your first impression of meeting an ARMY online and IRL! The funny stories! The emotional ones! The bad ones! Tell me please! &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

Mods, I was torn between Discussion and Fan Acct flair. Please dont scrap this! #okbye

Maybe a lot of you would say every fandom has that kind of people but in vietnam, we have a bunch of forums and pages which translate all those hottest news of kpop,and every time there is any article about BP ,Army take over the top comments and say bad things about them. Now, I really wonder if we are following the step of other kpop group that used to bully us and become an annoying fandom like them? Many many armies are trying to deny others achievement like those did to us before? Tbh, I dont think there is any solution to this because many fanpages here have called upon to just focus on our boys but the results still the same.And I feel uneasy and unfair that most people would see us that way while we are better than that and we have done a lot of beautiful things together.

""Stream Like A Non-fan/Human!!!""

I've seen countless advices on how to stream MVs properly, yet our views are still getting deleted. Reasons? Because we are all doing it similarly: Watch. Clear browser. Refresh. That's not how a real human watch videos, that's considered bots activity.

So, my advice is that, be creative with how you watch the MV. No matter how many devices you have, how many tricks you use, be random. 
For example: Watch. Then pick another random video to watch or comment. Then go back. Comment. Go watch something else, 1 or 2 others. Then come back. Change the routine oftenly. 

This would take more time and efforts than usual, but also more fun and interesting, and most importantly more effective with no worries about being marked as bots. 

Only one thing, make sure every other element of the MVs is normal too. Decent resolution: 480/720/1080p/1440p, volume available. Technically, 30s is enough to be counted as a view, but multiple 30s viewings will be filtered as non-human activities. So again, 30-40-50-80-60, anything, be random. 

Remember, a human is allowed watch one video many times, but don't try tips and tricks to fool Youtube like using VPN or other mass streaming routines because they know them all. Just watch and enjoy the comeback normally then be rewarded. 

P/s: i hope that if it's possible, this thread can be pinned all the way till comeback day

About Halsey, Ive never followed her or listened to her music, so I dont know full the extent to how problematic people say she is. From what Ive seen, it seems like a lot of her controversies are in the past and a little over-exaggerated? If anyone could give me a little more info on her Id be grateful. 

I think people are right when they say that most of the anger boils down to the fact that the title track has a feature, and on top of that, its a western artist. Its very different. Ive seen people express that they are uncomfortable with the amount of collaborations BTS has had with western artists as of late. I personally have no issue with it, but it is something I never gave much thought since I became an army in the midst of the LY era. Id like to hear others thoughts on the matter.

But anyway, I just felt that how well the concept of theatre fits with persona. In a way persona is acting, an outer layer so that we would be more approachable/ likeable, more integrated in the society so that we can life a bit easier. There is a clear difference in our persona and our real self so in a way our persona is a character we play so won't it be interesting to have the concept of persona shown through theatre and acting?

I will use the term OG Army for fans that have joined the fandom in the period 2013-2016.

Ever since LY: Her dropped, fandom's reactions to BTS' music and their artistic approach have been polarizing. I'm sure that you noticed that reactions to the ""Boy With Luv"" teaser have been like that too. While there are many people who love it, there are many who dislike it. The same happened with the whole LY trilogy. But based on what I've seen, it's interesting to notice that there seems to be a visible split in the fandom. 

It's safe to say that the loudest bunch that detests LY: Her (particularly DNA) are OG ARMYs while the new fans love it since it's the album that introduced many to the fandom and brought a lot of new fans. 

With LY: Tear, the situation is reversed. The crowd that's the most hyped over LY: Tear (especially b-sides) are OG ARMYs since this album is very reminiscent of BTS' music that they fell in love with and in a way, this album feels like coming for home. For new fans, things seem to be a little different since quite a few don't really vibe with the b-sides on this album.

With LY: Answer being a compilation album, the reactions are mixed. But Idol evokes strong feelings in both sides. Out of all title tracks, I believe that this is the one that leaves nobody indifferent. People seem to either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. The same can be said for the music video.

Since we're approaching a new era, the expectations are high. Based on all hints and throwbacks that BTS blessed us with, many hoped for an album that's heavy on hip-hop. Many were hyped over the thought that we'd get something like Dark &amp; Wild again. The trailer both delivered and didn't. In terms of music, it's what people hoped it'd be. In terms of music video, not so much.

With the today's release of the teaser, the opinions I've seen so far are extremely polarizing. The people who are against it, who dislike it or just don't vibe with it, are OG ARMYs for the most part. Or at least they're the loudest. On the other side, there are people who adore it and are excited about BTS collabing with Halsey. The loudest ones are those who joined the fandom during LY: Her or later.

This lead me to ask the question whether BTS will lose the fans who have been with them since the beginning. Is trying to appeal to a broader audience (because let's be honest, the change in BTS sound is quite evident and collaboration with a Western artist on the title track will lead to the song being more public friendly) worth losing all people that gave them the initial push? 

A lot of OG ARMYs are still here because LY: Tear was enjoyable for them, especially after LY: Her, and it gave them (false) hope that BTS will return to that sound.

BTS seem to be aware of this too, if we can judge it based on a few fancafe posts and things they have said.

Please note that this question is in no way discouraging BTS from exploring new genres and wanting to reach more people with their music, this is just me being curious about possible changes that this comeback will bring to the fandom.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

From the teaser trailer today, seeing that its highly likely its gonna be linked to Boy In Luv in some way, and that era/the early days, do you guys reckon this is maybe BTS' way to bring everything full circle and start to slow their career down? We are (I think) gonna be getting the last of the Save Me Webtoon this week (for those of us who don't buy the fast track thing) which will probably wrap up one of their biggest mysteries with the whole storyline, obviously we also have the big end to their world tour with SPEAK YOURSELF and now this teaser. In my eyes, in general they show no sign of slowing down, they're hitting it so big being the global superstars they are. There's just a niggle in the back of my head and I was wondering if anyone else thought the same.

\- that a whole series of  153 Bela Bartok pieces exists (I'm sure glad I didn't have to play any of them during my childhood piano lesson days); and 

\- more about Dionysus than I ever knew before;

So it is known that you will not get a guaranteed full set from Amazon just by ordering 4 quantities of the album, as stated [here](https://imgur.com/a/t5PFYqm).

Now, however, it's been going around that if you speak with Amazon customer support that have the ability to guarantee you 4 different versions. And much like a lot of other people, I wanted to buy from Amazon because of it being cheaper than Bighits store and being able to recieve it sooner

So I decided to ask several representatives to find out whether or not I can get it guaranteed.

**TLDR; You may or may not get all 4 versions, either by chance or the customer representative actually had the ability to do so, but if you REALLY want the 4 versions, dont risk it (you could also just return the extra ones though).**


[This is how my first live chat worked out](https://imgur.com/a/oJ51lgz), which took place March 25th. When I wrote I talked to other representatives, that was fabrication to see what they would say. When he said ""it clearly shows version 1, version 2,...."" I knew he did not know what he was talking about, so I decided to go on to the next representative.

[This is how my second live chat worked out](https://imgur.com/a/L65tI32). This took place right after the previous one, and it looked promising, as they seemed like they knew what was going on. However, when they confirmed I would get multiple copies, I knew I had to confirm whether or not I would get the multiple versions.

[This next chat took place the next day](https://imgur.com/a/L6fYOgL). They confirmed what the previous rep said, however, I feel as if they really didn't do much investigating. They just looked at the product page, and when I told them what the previous reps said, they just decided to agree with them. Still not a safe answer for me.

[This took place after I took a dive and purchased it, but I was a bit hesitant about actually going through with it](https://imgur.com/a/QXk5z8Y) This person hit me with the if I bought 4 copies, I'd get the same version 4 times, and that was the complete opposite of what others have said lol. Once I told them other reps told me otherwise, I guess they tried to get rid of me and send me to their phone team? I don't know, It just made me feel as if he also did not know what he was talking about, and just looked at the product page, so this also wasn't enough.

[The last chat, which took place today](https://imgur.com/a/T8rXEEe). This person also just went solely off of the product page and also denied the claims of my previous reps who said I would be guaranteed the different versions. 

However, it was at this point I realized, I was either going to get reps who only looked at the product page and used that information, or those who will guarantee me different versions. (I also got a free $25 discount which was neat lol). 

With this information, I just decided that I shouldn't trust Amazon reps when dealing with BTS albums because it seems as if they really don't know the answer themselves, considering this way of selling random albums isn't really known in the US (correct me if I'm wrong).

So why did I make this post? Just to state that you shouldn't trust Amazon reps, and should just weigh your options when considering where to get from. If you don't care about ~$10-30, or the shipping time, you should probably just do BigHit's store to be guaranteed. However, if you are ok with not getting it instantly, Amazon is your best bet considering you can just return the extra copies and purchase from somewhere else.",32,45,False,self,,,,,

That at the end of Map of the Soul, they'll disband. Especially since Jin has to join the military soon. Could all seven boys join the military after this, which means no BTS for two years? This makes sense to me since TXT just debuted too. So then BigHit can continue making money off TXT and the BigHit staff all keep their jobs since they work with TXT now. Then hopefully after two years, BTS comes back. It also makes sense that they are going super hard in the American market for this era since they will be gone from the scene. I find the Kpop scene the idols churn music out constantly with hardly any breaks. It's just new music and new eras almost every year. The American market, musicians can take two to three years and then come back stronger than ever because people have been waiting for them.

I am going to be in Japan in July and I would like to buy tickets for any of the four concerts BTS are going to do in the country during this month. Apparently it's complicated to get the tickets if you are not Japanese, and the only website I could purchase them from was Viagogo, who sells them for over six times the price at the cheapest. I was told that it was possible to get them on the Fanclub, and I have a friend living in Japan that offered to help me.but apparently it costs money to register and none of us were able to get information on whether we were certain to be able to buy the tickets now on the website or if the show might be sold out. I don't mind paying for the registration, but I want to make sure that I'll be able to get the tickets that I want if I do. If anyone has any information of the subject if would be very appreciated.

Look I know on social media we are all super connected and we talk about army sticking together but in real life I feel like that is RARELY the case! 

Im a university student and Ive seen quite a few bangtan fans on campus! And Ive even tried to strike up conversation! For example, theres this one girl who always is on the same bus with me and she has a bunch of jungkook pins on her backpack but whenever I try talking to her she gives out like one or two sentences and then goes back to listening to music on her headphones and I never see her around with any other people.Another day I met a male fan who like talked to me for like two minutes and then got really awkward. Another girl I saw with a TATA laptop case talked for a little bit and then same thing. I really dont get whats up with these people.

We have like a kpop dance group club in college that performs and Im not someone who dances well so thats not really for me, but even that group isnt really the type to go out and get drunk at bars and go to frat parties (or throw their own party) on the weekends....which is what I like to do with my friends for fun.

I dont get it, personally it would be so fun for me to have friends who would pregame to BTS music or other kpop songs and then go out clubbing with me, but does our fandom not attract that crowd? Or is it just my bad luck that the fans around me are all really socially awkward?",164,140,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Inspired by [DJ Riddler on Twitter](https://twitter.com/djriddler/status/1116020560654479360).

&amp;#x200B;

My list:

* Ddaeng (viral on Twitter, makes you shout 'Ddaeng!' by the second chorus)
* Euphoria (#4 on Spotify, trendy genre, very GP-friendly)
* Save Me (really solid EDM track)
* Singularity (based off of YouTube non-fan reactions, it seems the sound is familiar/less overwhelming)
* Serendipity ([Khalid approved](https://twitter.com/thegreatkhalid/status/1034519822887862272?lang=en))

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mentions:

* MIC Drop
* Waste It On Me
* Fire
* Fake Love
* Blood Sweat &amp; Tears",29,81,False,self,,,,,

I dont know if this is the right place to post this, but can anyone explain to me why there are still official BTS tickets available on the stadefrance website? This will be my first BTS concert and Id always heard about how getting BTS tickets was a mess and that tickets sold out in a few minutes. But now, I think a month after the ticket sale started, there are STILL tickets available! 

Its not even like its only the bad tickets that are left, the second best category (Carr Or @ 177,50) is still available!!! 

I have an extra ticket Carr Or for the 7th, the first date, and Id like to sell it (@ face value) since Im going on the 8th with friends, but why would anyone buy my ticket if they can get it on the official website? If nobody buys it Ill probably go see them once in my own, but I would have spent 355 in total 

Is this usual for BTS concerts? 
Why do you think tickets are still available? 
Is supply greater than demand this time? 
Will part of the huge stadium be empty?
Whats the probability of me being able to sell my ticket?

For me, itll be 10am in the U.K. when the MV is released. 

I was supposed to stay at my boyfriends tonight (Thursday) but I decided its too much stress to have to get home during morning rush hour so I can watch and listen to everything with my sister. Were going to go out for dinner tonight instead. Thankfully, hes very understanding lol. 

My sister and I are going to be home all day tomorrow (she even booked the day off work specifically for the comeback lol). Well wake up in time for the MV and probably spend the rest of the day/weekend contributing to YouTube views and Spotify streams. My copy of Love Yourself in Seoul should be arriving tomorrow or the day after, so well end up watching that too, fingers crossed! Were due a rewatch of Burn the Stage, so thats on the cards, too.

[](#sg_scream)

Welcome to comeback time!

Our mod team has been hard at work in improving the sub and keeping it from burning down for you guys. Similar to the Answer comeback, we are here with this thread to point you all in the right direction to go before everything drops. Lets not make mistakes when submitting posts as to not have our incredibly beautiful mods weeping as they remove another thread that should go somewhere else.

The way to achieve happiness and keep the sub running is through ***M E G A T H R E A D S***. Soon therell be a decent amount of content flooding in, so before submitting anything, please make sure its not better suited for one of the compilations instead. Exceptions are mentioned in the relevant megathreads. Dont make papa cry.

The megathreads were planning to have are:

---

#I. Map of the Soul: PERSONA Comeback Hype Thread  

This is where you go with your **strong feelings**. This thread will be posted about three hours before the release. A free-for-all thread for pre-release hype and immediate post-release emotion dump.

---

#II. PERSONA Achievements Megathread  

**See past examples:** [WINGS Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/56u39p/bts_wings_record_breakers_will_be_updated_as_more/), [YNWA Achievement Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tm5yc/ynwa_achievements_megathread/), [HER Achievements Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tjn5/her_achievements_megathread/).  

---

#III. PERSONA Theories Megathread  

**See past examples:** [YNWA Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5tmifx/ynwa_theories_megathread/), [Love Yourself Teaser/Films Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6tut7y/love_yourself_teasersfilms_theory_megathread/), [HER Theories Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmhu/love_yourself_herdna_theory_thread/).

---

#IV. PERSONA Radio Play Megathread  

**See past example:** [HER Radio Play Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/70tmz3/her_radio_play_megathread/)

---

#V. PERSONA English Press Coverage Megathread  

Here is where you should post all the English press coverage, from Fuse to Billboard to less notable articles. 

**Important Note:** If its from a *very* notable outlet, such as Rolling Stone, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc. it can have its own thread. Outlets that commonly report about BTS (like Fuse or Billboard), or dont have the same kind of readership/reputation as the aforementioned outlets, will be redirected to the megathread.    

---

#VI. SNS Mentions Megathread  

Here is where you should post all the SNS mentions BTS is sure to get from other celebrities on Twitter, Instagram, etc. when this album drops!  

**Important Note:** The same rules as the English Press Coverage thread apply here. If someone like Obama tweets about BTS that tweet can have its own thread. (Come through this time, B.)  

**Important Note II:** BTS tweets should be posted like usual. They can have their own thread, but if a bunch of tweets are posted in quick succession, they should be *compiled into one self-post compilation* [like so](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6me9eo/170710_bts_tweet_compilation/).

--- 

#VII. PERSONA - Song Information, Streaming Availability, and Album Discussion Megathread  

This thread is going to contain all the info about where you can stream PERSONA (like on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, as well as other platforms we know to look out for) as well as links to translations of the lyrics. 

Well try to link places you can stream in different countries outside of the USA too, but we will need you guys help to tell us since we dont know about every single country. It will be updated as close to real time as humanly possible for us very busy mods!  

This thread is also to be used for general album discussion of the songs. **Please keep any pure hype comments in the hype thread instead of this one, since its for more thoughtful discussion.**   

---

#VIII. Music Show Voting Megathread  

**See past examples:** [YNWA Music Show Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5thmw4/how_to_help_bts_win_on_music_shows_billboard_100/), [HER Music Show Megathread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6w02h9/how_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide/).   

---

#IX. Compilation Redirect Gigathread  

The behemoth to have all of our backs: this thread will be **stickied** and contain links to *all* the other megathreads for your browsing convenience.  

--- 


##X. Discord Server  

Dont forget you can request an invite to our Discord server to scream with fellow A.R.M.Ys in real time.  You can get a better feel of how Discord works in [this beautiful, sexy tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yuT8_GlIiGWDbyT_x6hpMXpsSV546tMPlzDEYQqG3Vg/edit?usp=sharing) written by your handsome Tech Support.

You can request an invite [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord).

[Join us for fun times!](https://i.imgur.com/FcfsmKM.gifv)

--- 

These threads are going to be manually posted by your truly ravishing, modest mods *(weeps)*, and due to the fact that we all live in very different timezones, they might be slightly staggered as to when they are posted. Please be patient when waiting for the threads or the OP to be updated.  

If we notice any other one type of content drowning the sub, well dropkick it in with another megathread when needed. In general: for gods sake, please remember that **compilations are always better than individual submissions** when it comes to a batch of similar content! 

Its almost time to board [the hype train](https://i.imgur.com/s0ogwkO.png) once again  hold hands with a priest and pray death away!

Cheers,

The /r/bangtan Mod Team.

&amp;#x200B;

Share your thoughts on what the LY meant to you!

&amp;#x200B;

For me it was the era that I got to know them. I became a fan just before Idol was released, as on my tv they made a report on k pop fans in Portugal. They showed DNA MV and I got hooked on the whistle haha. I was a k pop fan long before I watched this, but I kinda of had distanced myself from that world since the ""downfall"" of SNSD (for me things kinda lost steam since Jessica left). So after watching that I went to youtube to watch DNA and the rest is history. I fell down the rabbit hole and never left it again (help haha). Started to read and watch everything connected to BTS. But the LY message is what made me an army, as it kind of ressonated with me. Unfortunately I always suffered from low self esteem, both in physical and psychological terms. But LY led me to see the other side of things and pushed me into the right direction - BTS made me grow up and finally accept me fully. I am a happier person now due to the work of 7 boys of my generation, and I never want to look back.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, that made me a bit sappy. But I feel better by sharing these with strangers. So, what did the LY era meant to you?",4,2,False,self,,,,,

On the eve of the comeback I thought I would share something thats been floating around my mind since the comeback trailer, which is the history of the word persona (and person) and how it plays into the current themes BTS is exploring. 

Persona comes from Latin word *persona*, which meant a character played by an actor; a person; and originally a mask. It is likely from the Etruscan word *phersu*, which was most likely derived from Greek. First I think its super interesting that the origin is Etruscan, because how many English words come from Etruscan? (For those who dont know, the Etruscans were an ancient people who lived north of Rome. They fought many wars with Rome over a number of centuries and eventually were conquered and assimilated into the Roman empire around the 3rd century BCE. This is where the name Tuscany comes from.) 

The Etruscan word, *phersu*, meant mask and when it was co-opted into Latin it most specifically meant the masks worn by actors in a play. To me this says that conceptually the mask and the character were seen as the same thing. An actor could not be the character unless he was wearing the mask, and donning the mask by default made him the character. This is a bit of conjecture on my part, but conceptually it fits in nicely with the Jungian definition of the persona. 

Persona could also be related to the Latin verb *personare* meaning to chant, shout, make loud noise, or sound through. This goes with the actions of an actor delivering his lines through the mask. It also relates back to give you all the voices till I die. To me this suggests that Namjoon cannot give us his voice without the RM mask; one does not exist without the other. There is also a literary definition of persona, which is a character that represents the voice of the author. Again this relates back to how Namjoon gives us his voice through the writing of RM.   

Taking this a bit further, its fascinating that the word person comes from a word meaning mask. (On a side note, the history of the concept of personhood, both legally and socially is really interesting. I recommend looking into it if you like that kind of thing, but I digress.) I think it suggests that a person cannot exist without some sort of mask a la the Jungian persona from the map of the soul. So its like our very existence as sentient beings requires us to have this persona which is both real and not real. 

Im going to stop here before I go too deep, but if anyone has other thoughts on this or if anyone thinks Im way off base, Id love to hear it.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

""With the wings of Icarus you gave me, Not towards the sun but towards you, I will fly""

Icarus was given wings by his father, who forbid him to fly too close to the sun nor to the water. However Icarus disobeyed him and approached too close to the sun which melted his wings and he fell and drowned.

To my understanding, RM is basically telling us that this love is going to burn his wings. I don't know why but I'm thinking of Young Forever and Wings, which by the way are appearing in some scenes of the MV. So crazy.


2) 

They are using the color blue for the boy and the color pink for the girl. I guess the color red is for the love. Yellow for the happiness. Orange not sure, maybe a between. As expected of BTS.


3)

I'm disappointed that Halsey didn't sing a part. Her participation sounds nice but honestly is not necessary. Wished she actually sang.


4) 

RM keeps a serious face all along, even until the end. Damn sexy btw, but why?


5)

Jin is blowing confidence and sexiness. More than ever. I screamed. It feels different but I love seeing his smile.

First thing I did this morning was check out Boy With Luv. I shared my opinion that I thought it was one of their worst title albums in a while and that I didn't really enjoy it, especially when compared to Fake Love, Idol, Mic Drop, Fire, DNA, Not Today etc. I didn't hate the song, just thought it wasn't as epic as some of their last releases. 

The amount of hate comments I got in return calling me a bitch, my opinion is shit, to get off the video, that I don't understand music, that I'm not a real Army. Pretty representative of how a lot of Army's are. Incredibly Immature and feel the need to White Knight BTS simply because I shared a friendly opinion some people disagreed with. Fortunately there were some people defending me but still shows how Toxic and Immature a lot of fans are. 

Now obviously I don't think all Army's are like this, but a lot are, any body who dares criticize anything BTS does, or have a non positive opinion about some of their music or whatever are just shit on by a lot of fans.

What advice/tips would you give to the writers to make a BTS story good?,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/bcef85/do_you_read_bts_fan_fiction_whywhy_not_what/,swater63,1555080559,"I'm very hesitant to read a BTS fan fiction myself, because of a couple of reasons:
1. Characterization: I'm a afraid the writer will be too focused on the members ""brands"", exaggerating these qualities. I feel like I have my own interpretation of their complex personalities, and if the writer diverges too far out of that zone, I don't think I'd find the story enjoyable (obviously there's some leeway, but I hope you understand what I mean). Furthermore, when you're very familiar with BTS and view them as the real people they are, I think it's even more difficult to portray them accurately. Since actually portraying characters that feel real, the full scope of their contradictions and nucances, is extremely hard. In addition to having to think about  what a BTS member would actually do or say in those situations, as well as, if the setting is not set in IRL, think about how a fictional background would affect the BTS' members personality while staying true to who they are.
2. Writing: I like to read both literature and fan fiction, both are enjoyable in different ways. However, I think some fan fiction writers who don't read a lot of published books, are not as expirenced with the mechanics of writing. While I personally like sometimes when fan fiction linger on a moment or meanders about, it can be a bit too much. 
3. Lack of research: This is in general a problem for me with fan fiction, especially with more serious issues like abuse, depression, rape etc. that the writers are trying to depict realistically. Most of them, and this is the case with a lot of published books as well, don't handle it with enough care and research. I also like when fan fiction writers research Korean culture in more depth, and make it clear that being Korean is a part of their identity  instead of making it more ""Western"", but I'm not too picky about that.

However, I'm considering writing a BTS fan fiction in the future. Which is why I was wondering about this: Do you read BTS fan fiction? Why/why not? What advice/tips would you give to the writers to make a BTS story good?",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I recently went on a trip to Italy, and during one of my free days there, I felt like I didn't know what to do. I was in Florence, and I had already seen the Uffizi and the Duomo and walked the town squares, already averaged two or three gelatos per day, and discovered the joys of pistachio cream croissants (cannot recommend more highly). What to do with my last free afternoon in Florence when I've already done the touristy must-dos?

Then I remembered RM's trip to Italy, and thought: wouldn't it be a fun scavenger hunt to try and recreate every photo he took? So I did.

# Mission: Florence

He posted photos from two major cities: Florence and Rome. It was my last day in Florence before I went on to Verona and Rome, so I started with the Florence photos. And I successfully got each one!

Here are the ones he took in Florence, along with my recreations of them. I know the angles don't perfectly match up on some, which is r/mildlyinfuriating, but what can ya do?

* Duomo, with pole: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/bAdhxks), [me](https://imgur.com/a/YPC233A)

* Duomo, without pole: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/WpmjXx1), [me](https://imgur.com/a/Wv3giKh)

* Carousel: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/YexuJBT), [me](https://imgur.com/a/xnrZOlu)

* Mystery spot: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/rZkVZv3), [me](https://imgur.com/a/bQRz0mh)

The first two are pretty easy to find, you just have to walk around the Duomo in a loop until you notice the pole. Then just walk around the pole area until you get the right angle. My friend had stuff to do on this day, so I mostly asked strangers to take the photos for me, and they all seemed to get really into the task and enjoyed trying to get the angle right when I told them what my mission was. (I don't speak Italian, I just approached people who looked like tourists.) The second Duomo one is harder; I can't really explain what angle it was taken at, but I will say that the structure he stands in front of changed and was under construction when I got there, so the photo isn't precisely the same. I also didn't want to turn my back on the stranger who had my phone (lol), so I didn't get the exact angle he got.

To get to the carousel, go from the Duomo towards Palazzo Vecchio. When you get close to Palazzo Vecchio, look to the right down one of the major walkways and you should see the carousel in the plaza at the end of it. I believe Montcler is in that plaza. Again, asked a stranger, they did a great job and got really into it.

The last one, labeled ""Mystery spot,"" was by far the hardest of all the photos to get (it's literally just him in front of an anonymous door--it could be anywhere), and required talking to several locals for guidance. One person would say, ""Hmm, I don't know, try looking around [place A]?"" And then I'd go to [place A] and ask someone there, and they'd tell me to look around [place B], and then I'd ask someone at [place B], until eventually I met a local who told me, ""Hmm, that looks like [mystery spot],"" and they were right. I thought it was a really fun travel activity to talk to people and go searching for it, so I'm not going to give instructions here on where it is, since I think you'd get a lot out of it too. :) You can PM me if you really want to know, but I will say I don't check this account often, so it might take awhile to get back to you.

# Mission: Rome

Rome was generally easier. Here are the photos he took along with my recreations:

* Roman ruins: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/K5oSw6E), [me](https://imgur.com/a/RkJPWMV)

* Spanish steps: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/pArTWyb), [me](https://imgur.com/a/T021Rcv)

* Colosseum: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/hhAfLe2), [me](https://imgur.com/a/0R8bcRs)

* Pantheon: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/gJQm6eA), [me](https://imgur.com/a/1LEoJHH)

* Cafe: [RM](https://imgur.com/a/8Qhl4XB), [me \(1\)](https://imgur.com/a/ezcrvw0), [me \(2\)](https://imgur.com/a/LxRRENZ)

The Roman ones are pretty self-explanatory, but it's generally pretty hard to get the angle right for each of them. I will say the Roman ruins one is pretty tricky to find the correct angle for, and I also observed that in order to get how few people he had in his shots, he had to have gone pretty early in the morning to take these.

I found it very helpful to start out the day in Rome by going to the top of the military museum, which gives you a bird's-eye view of the city from which you can pick out and plan your destinations. Given I didn't know the names of any of the tourist sites (lol I do no research when I travel), I didn't know to look up any of the locations, so I just looked around from there and got a pretty good sense of where things were and mapped out the day. You can just look them up and plan ahead, though, since I've given you the names of all the locations. Everything is within walking distance of each other.

The trick with the Roman ruins is that it's not taken within the ruins themselves. My friend and I felt like we got played once we realized this (lol). The ruins are still worth visiting, though! You can play around with the angles once you're inside, and then find the vantage point from which he took it.

Spanish steps were pretty easy; he took the photo from near the base. I recommend going early, since it gets pretty crowded during the day.

Colosseum required some walking around to determine the right angle.

Pantheon was pretty easy, but again, you should go early to make sure there's not too many people. I wasn't with my friend this day (she was still asleep), so I asked a stranger to take the photo for me, and he was like, ""Oh, recreating a photo your friend took?"" to which I replied, ""Yeah... something like that.""

The cafe was the hardest of the Roman locations, but again, not too hard given the hints he includes in the original photo. You just had to include the right keywords in your Google search, and it comes up as the first result. You'll definitely be able to find it from looking at my photo. Apparently it's the most famous cafe in Rome--it was really really good! It was near my hotel, so I went there many times over my stay in Rome. It gets very crowded during the day, so I recommend visiting early in the morning or very late at night. The baristas are cool to talk to, as well, if there's not too many people around.

Fun fact: when I posted all these pics on my finsta alongside his originals, my friend messaged me and asked ""Who's that cute boy you're traveling with???"" l m a o

# Conclusion

I thought this was a great way to get to see the sights in both Florence and Rome, and would recommend the experience! It takes you all over both cities, and while it doesn't take you to every nice site (for example, there's a really nice bridge in Florence he didn't post pics of, and he didn't post pics of the Uffizi), it takes you to many of them. It thought it was a fun way to fill a free day in both cities.

Have you also recreated his photos? Please share! I also can try to answer any questions you may have. :) I also have more recommendations for Rome, Florence, and Verona if you're interested!",18,176,False,self,,,,,

Everything about it feels so... Not BTS. I dont want to stop others from enjoying it &amp; Im happy that other people do. I want them to continue on with their success &amp; I will support them. 

My problem is the album (minus Persona itself) feels so western. Or is that only me? I feel like so many people love it &amp; I feel so alone on this opinion. 

Even sometimes their voices sound so different &amp; not like themselves. I know that they wont always have that same sound &amp; same style but it feels almost too drastic, as if theyre trying to appeal to the western market. 

Again, please know that I love BTS with all my heart &amp; this is in no way hate towards them. I just needed to get my opinion out to a public space &amp; see how other people felt &amp; have a discussion.

I wont be surprised or offended if this post inevitably gets taken down.

If you think about it, Wings came out of nowhere, in a way. Smack in the middle of the rising days of HYYH and the glory days of the Love Yourself series, Wings is a standalone middle chapter that makes itself stand apart in many ways.

Even the styling is different. Contrasting from the grounded aesthetic of HYYH and the colorful, zany fun of most of the Love Yourself series, we got to see BTS decked out in lavish suits and chokers. They seemed to go for a very different aesthetic that time around. 

Wings era opened with seven beautiful short films, accompanied by each of the member's very first solo songs to be put onto a full group album. I do notice that these short films are very rarely referenced or remembered compared to the Highlight Reels, for example.

So while Wings era brought a new wave of success for BTS, kicking off with Blood Sweat And Tears, I never see it referred to as BTS' prime the way Love Yourself does, nor does it get referenced as their humble rising days like HYYH.

How do you think Wings will be remembered within the fandom?",38,132,False,self,,,,,

Now, I was a hardcore fan since 2015 but it died down a little but I still stream and love them and I couldnt let someone bash them. So I took it to myself and made sure he knew what he was saying was false and probably not what he wanted to really deeply say.

Here is what I said and keep in mind I didnt have much space to type so this is what I got out
Tell me one way bts is disgusting with solid evidence. Also, disgusting means that they are nasty or gross. None of you use the word right and just use it for attention and clout. Blackpink in the 3 years out of bts 6 or 7 years of being a group have had more scandals and severe problems than bts. The few scandals bts have are fake and almost always never their fault. One huge one that one member did that didnt realize the terrible defects it could bring to their group was Jennie who practically just gave up on dancing but yg still gives her a solo. Big hit actually listens and gives namjoon a good solo, great verse, gives Jin a great song, more time for himself and the other members. But blackpink (bp) on the other hand have about 10 songs every 10 months or year because they are scared or they dont want to mess up because theyre cowards. While bts confess, work hard and show what they got unlike people like you who just shove their talent into someones face and leave it. again Moderates please dont delete this at its important to know how to properly deal with people with false accusations. I also think Blackpink is very talented but over appreciated for the work they get done for them.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

so they had a comeback with the song boy with luv,i just watched it and ......

first off I thought Halsey would have a proper verse to sing the song but she was just ad-libbing a few lines , I didn't really see a reason for her to do this collaboration

their music sounded very generic, I got really bored listening to the song..but suga and rm's parts were good

also listening to their songs I feel though as if they lost the essence of what they truly are .

it sounds like they want to appeal to the international audience (and nothing wrong with that, because Kpop was made for mainstream appeal) but even if they do have personal intentions and lyrics in a song it comes off heavily commercialised.

Yoongi is very reserved like a cat and is extremely passionate about the music.

1. Using outside producers/ in house producers
BTS always used outside producers, not only Pdogg, Slow Rabbit worked on music on their older albums, Wings in particular, had *a lot* of outside collaborators. The only reason why it seems like their are more than usual is because people are much more vocal about it because working with BTS carries a lot of weight and the people they work with now are more famous. Also BTS has several songs that were completely bought off other people and maybe tweaked a bit, such as Dead Leaves and Cypher 4. Many songs were made in collaboration between Rap Line/ in house producers/out of house producers. This whole they use more outside producers now thing is very untrue. In fact, they have more producers now in house than ever.

2. Rap line dont usually complete self produce or write songs by themselves. They always had help from in house and out of house. Its always co-written. Their older music is no exception. They have the same credits.

3. How people received BTS pre LY music 

People called Wings boring and incohesive when it was released. A lot of people. People called HYYH pt 1 generic and uninspired when it was released. A lot of people. In fact, I remember a whole post made by fans that Wings was gonna live D&amp;W shadow and every one agreed. They were called sellouts when they stopped being a full out hip hop group and when they were a hip hop group they were try hard wannabes. 
Nothing BTS has ever done was unanimously accepted well. Everything theyve done always received strong backlash. Only in retrospect does BTS get a crumb of credit.

I feel like nostalgia hits and older fans romanticize the time when they first became a fan and forget some truth to how BTS came up. Newer fans just rely on misinformation.",182,426,False,self,,,,,

The [Bottom 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/adsxzn/bottom_5_songs_no_hate_just_interested_xx/) thread is still my favorite chaotic thread this sub has ever produced. In that thread I said my least favorite song was Not Today... and by god do I stand by that.

However I also mentioned **Just Dance** being not my favorite song. However after getting to witness the sheer Jhope brilliance live in Hong Kong I was absolutely converted. I really enjoy Just Dance now and I apologize for the early slander, it really does have such a lovely upbeat mood. It's also the only song I saw live that grew that much for me, So What and Answer hardly changed ranks so I know it's not just because I'm biased towards the live performance.  

WINGS has also had a huge shift for me since my first listen when it was released. I used to have **Begin** as one of my top BTS songs and **Stigma** was a song I hardly paid attention to. Within the last year Stigma did a total 180 for me, it is probably my favorite off of Wings and easily in my top 20 now and Begin has become a skippable song for me (perhaps because I overplayed it) and totally fell off in my ranking. 

But yeah, which songs have had the greatest rises and greatest songs within your personal BTS song ranking?

I know lots of people are doing their own research, but I thought that making a comprehensive theory video would be easier for some people. I honestly have never been a huge BTS theorist, but this specific comeback really pulled at my heart strings because it includes all of my favorite things: BTS, philosophy, Greek mythology (which both had major influences of Jungs work), and of course one of my favorite humansCarl Jung. Would I be wasting my time or would this actually help some people? Please let me know!!

I dont believe Ive ever really posted here aside from commenting on a few threads here and there. Im a 30-some man who got my boyfriend into BTS two years ago during their HER era. Ever since then, hes wanted to make reaction videos to their videos and performances. We invested in a light ring and a few computer programs to make that happen. 

Hes wanted to make a video for their comeback this time around so we decided to do one for Boy with Luv. And hes ecstatic. So, the link to the reaction is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZvVYWVo4bM&amp;feature=share

Im not sure if this is accepted here or if blatant self promotion is okay but he asked me if I could post the link somewhere for viewing outside of Facebook. I apologize in advance if its not allowed. 

If you view it, could you possibly give me some advice as well? Is the setup okay? What do you think? Its our first video so were both really nervous and our personalities really dont shine just yet. 

Thank you in advance and love you all!

I'm writing a research paper for my college class on world music, and I'm hoping to find a few people to interview about BTS. My paper will explore how and why BTS became so successful internationally. I want to look at why BTS specifically has achieved this level of success, and how their popularity has influenced (and has been influenced by) global views on K-pop as a genre. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I'd like to hold the interviews through audio or video calls (probably Google Hangouts or Discord) sometime in the next week. Any mentions of your interview responses will be completely anonymous in my paper, and I'll delete any information about your responses once the paper is submitted. The interviews will be short (\~15 min) and relatively informal. If you're uncomfortable with an audio or video call, I can also send you my questions through email or DM, and you can send your responses back to me that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that in the US it take quite a long time for them to arrive, but I can't seem to find any posts on how long it takes for them to arrive in Australia.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to the concert on May 5th, and as a guy, am wondering if you guys had any suggestions for good merch that I could wear that is more suitable for guys! I've seen jerseys and might get those, but was wondering if there are any other good options out there that I haven't thought of/seen yet. It doesn't have to be official; I'm ok with buying off eBay or a Chinese site, but just looking for suggestions!

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Do they sell apparel at the concert itself?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! :)",19,36,False,self,,,,,

Ill also throw in some free albums and unofficial photocards if you buy them. Bottom line is, I need these sold ASAP. My boss just cut my work schedule from 4 shifts a week to 1 with no notice and I was hoping to give these tickets to friends but if I dont find a way to sell them this week, idk if Ill be able afford gas/food this month.

Do they always send posters unfolded and in a cardboard roll? I would prefer if the posters would be sent to me that way instead of folded, however I'm unsure if they'd do that for 1 album alone.

Also, does anyone know after how much time I will be able to purchase a certain version of their latest album instead of a random one? (small curiosity: how come this one doesn't come with a poster anymore, since I'm seeing the LY trilogy did).

Also, I'd appreciate any alternatives you have for a fellow ARMY in Europe. Thanks you.",2,9,False,self,,,,,

An excerpt:

BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, was formed in 2013 by the Big Hit Entertainment record executive [Bang Si Hyuk](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bts-mn0003136056/biography).  Hyuks vision for the group was that the members would not be the  machine-like pop stars that Korean pop typically producedthat he would  allow them to be vulnerable, and talk about their [fears and anxieties](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/13/17426350/bts-history-members-explained)  about being young people and pop stars. The members would also write  their own lyrics, Hyuk thought would help them better connect to fans.

He was right. BTSs connection with fans, who call themselves [the ARMY](https://www.usbtsarmy.com/), runs unusually deep. The group broke through internationally in 2017, with the album *Love Yourself: Her*,  which contained the bands first single to make the Billboard Hot 100,  the influential US music chart used to rank the countrys most popular  songs. Meanwhile, with BTSs success, Big Hit Entertainment grew to an  operating profit of [over $50 million last year](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bts/8503273/bts-label-big-hit-entertainment-record-results-2018).

The  hidden star of the new album is producer Pdogg. The Korean producer has  worked with BTS since before the bands last album, and outside of the  group, no person may be more responsible for the [sound of its music](https://www.soompi.com/article/1089993wpp/big-hit-producer-pdogg-shares-like-create-music-bts). Pdogg is credited as the producer and a lead songwriter of the albums two best songs:[HOME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AT7oSGZbQ) and [Boy with Luv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsX3ATc3FbA).  HOME is a classic Korean pop song, combining sophisticated 1990s  style American R&amp;B melodies with modern pop production and lyrics in  Korean, English and even a little Spanish. Boy with Luv owes less to  Korean pop history, and more to electronic dance music (EDM). The chorus  is as catchy as a Taylor Swift or Rihanna song, and it seems destined  to be the bands first top ten hit in the US.",8,87,False,self,,,,,

From the band of which my love is strong.

Some ask why and so I supply,

With much eagerness the following reply:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I discovered Tomorrow in a time of need

When my future seemed rough and unguaranteed.

To me, BTS was the best reprieve  

From the anxieties of everyday life I grieved.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The tune itself first drew me in.

I searched the lyrics and that did begin

My obsession with that four minute track

For it gave me back the peace I lacked.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It was like my own personal letter

Things get worse before theyre better

Follow your dreams and dont give up

Thats the message that I drank up

The future seems far away 

But dont despair itll be okay 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The words struck a chord in my heart,

But that is only just one part.

I really must implore,

This masterpiece is so much more!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The beat is just the perfect mingle

Of angsty riff and badass jingle.

The lyrics are as deep as the ocean,

Almost as deep as ARMYs devotion.

And oh boy, the choreography,

Whoever made it deserves a trophy!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, their voices are just divine,

Jimins high notes send me to cloud nine.

Jungkooks voice is smooth as honey,

J-Hope always makes me feel sunny.

RM and Suga rap with so much emotion

And of course, V has my devotion.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In summary I hope I have managed to convey

Just why Tomorrow shall stay

My absolute and favourite song

For a time that will be very long!

(Note: I wrote this before the comeback, so please share your thoughts on how this information changes in light of the new MV and album.)


Persona comes from Latin word persona, which meant a character played by an actor; a person; and originally a mask. It is likely from the Etruscan word phersu, which was most likely derived from Greek. First I think its super interesting that the origin is Etruscan, because how many English words come from Etruscan? (For those who dont know, the Etruscans were an ancient people who lived north of Rome. They fought many wars with Rome over a number of centuries and eventually were conquered and assimilated into the Roman empire around the 3rd century BCE. This is where the name Tuscany comes from.) 


The Etruscan word, phersu, meant mask and when it was co-opted into Latin it most specifically meant the masks worn by actors in a play. To me this says that conceptually the mask and the character were seen as the same thing. An actor could not be the character unless he was wearing the mask, and donning the mask by default made him the character. This is a bit of conjecture on my part, but conceptually it fits in nicely with the Jungian definition of the persona. 


Persona could also be related to the Latin verb personare meaning to chant, shout, make loud noise, or sound through. This goes with the actions of an actor delivering his lines through the mask. It also relates back to give you all the voices till I die. To me this suggests that Namjoon cannot give us his voice without the RM mask; one does not exist without the other. There is also a literary definition of persona, which is a character that represents the voice of the author. Again this relates back to how Namjoon gives us his voice through the writing of RM. 


Taking this a bit further, its fascinating that the word person comes from a word meaning mask. (On a side note, the history of the concept of personhood, both legally and socially is really interesting. I recommend looking into it if you like that kind of thing, but I digress.) I think it suggests that a person cannot exist without some sort of mask a la the Jungian persona from the map of the soul. So its like our very existence as sentient beings requires us to have this persona which is both real and not real.

For me this album is about their public Persona and how they find to keep in their path because of the love and support of their fans, that they may be tempted by fame and power but in the end of the day is their love for art that matters and they are thankful for us recognizing and be open to listen what they have to say.

So the mood of the album is a reflection in their public journey so far with us. 

Now if their next mini is indeed Shadow do you guys think it will be about their struggles and dark side? Tear was more sadness, this mini would be more dark feelings like anger, pride, fear?

Also the theory that next album will not include an intro because their immersed in Shadow so Intro Persona will be for this both ( or 3?) albums.

[BTS is currently the biggest boy band](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229760/bts-boy-with-luv-youtube-record) in the world. And now that more people [have begun to notice](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/228931/bts-bbmas-nomination-top-group-paved-the-way-hastag), all eyes are on the [South Korean septets newest release](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229639/bts-persona-boy-with-luv-featuring-halsey-music-video).  Some expected them to bend to Western audiences, making something  palatable for those whose tolerance for foreign language ends at  Despacito.

After the band became the [first Korean act to land a No.1 album](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8473245/bts-love-yourself-answer-album-debuts-No1-billboard-200-chart)  on the Billboard 200 in 2018, the pressure to have a huge first single  land outside of South Korea was even greater. Then came the big news a  few days before the release [that they had landed two high-profile collaborations](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229639/bts-persona-boy-with-luv-featuring-halsey-music-video),  Halsey and Ed Sheeran, essentially confirming for many that their sixth  EP would be framed with the English-speaking pop mainstream in mind.

 But this is [Bangtan Sonyeondan](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/228305/bts-why-they-wont-sing-in-english-hit-songs), who thrive on the unexpected. Instead of sounding like an album for a party they were just invited to, *Map of the Soul*: *Persona* is an invitation into the deeply philosophical, expansive recesses of what fans like to call the [BTS Universe](https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/BTS_Universe). 

 No song makes this more clear than *Map of the Soul*: *Personas* sparkly lead single, [Boy With Luv featuring Halsey](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229639/bts-persona-boy-with-luv-featuring-halsey-music-video), a favorite to hit No.1. Its [light, funk-laced pop](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229642/boy-with-luv-bts-songwriter-melanie-fontana-saturday-night-live).  But members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook subvert what a  foreign boy band trying to get on American airwaves would be expected  to do. Halsey doesnt have a standalone English verse and is instead  folded into the chorus, singing a fluid blend of English *and*  Korean. The song features live instruments and not machine-generated  sounds expected of the K-pop factory. And even in a song that is meant  to be especially appealing to a wider audience, BTS lyrics speak to  fans directly. 

 Boy With Luvs Korean title, ""   "" translates to ""A Poem for  the Small Things."" Its title suggests a follow-up to their intense 2014 [teen anthem ""Boy In Luv,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8MfJg68oCs)  about the confusion of young love that seems out of reach. Now, five  years wiser, BTS acknowledge the love that they already possess:  sweet-voiced Jimin sees it in the simplest gesture of asking about your  day while rapper J-Hope sees it as knowing that while he cant be a  superhero to everyone, he can do his best to protect those he cares  about. 

And  even more surprisingly, in the brassy Ed Sheeran collab Make It  Right, Sheerans voice is completely absent. New listeners can likely  recognize faint echoes of the singer-songwriters Shape of You, but in  the end, this track isnt about him. It's about BTS and those they  count on. They sing that their most successful moments (described as  ""the sea), would feel like a desert without their fans and loved ones.

Early on, it was revealed that the themes of *Map of the Soul*: *Persona* are [grounded in Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung's theories of psychology](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/227199/bts-map-of-the-soul-persona-new-album-theories),  ""persona"" being an archetype of the human mind that deals with who we  present ourselves to the world. With their introspective [*Love Yourself* trilogy](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/219244/best-k-pop-albums-2018),  BTS explored the joys and difficulties of learning self-acceptance.  Now, theyre looking outward, trying to make sense of the world around  them and their place in it. [*Intro*: *Persona* has leader RM rapping](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-online-personal-trainer) over a sample of[ BTS' 2014 song ""Intro: Skool Luv Affair](https://twitter.com/glowinguk/status/1110926441913434112),""  So Im asking once again, who the hell am I? and acknowledging that  as an artist in the public eye, hes conflicted in his public image.  ""The 'me' that I want myself to be/ The 'me' that people want me to be/  The 'me' that you love/ And the 'me' that I create/ The 'me' that's  smiling/ The 'me' that's sometimes in tears/\[...\] Persona, spits RM in  the final verse.

*Map of the Soul*: *Persona*  closes with Dionysus (the indulgent, Greek masked god of wine),  which feels like BTS most extravagant persona of them all. Its  rollicking prog rock-infused hip-hop/trap can feel largely overwhelming,  like a party gone too out-of-control. But this victory song is  perhaps meant to unsettle you. Another [look at the lyrics](https://twitter.com/doyou_bangtan/status/1116654299327553541)  shows a deeper commentary on the emptiness of stardom if theres no  artistry behind it: Born as a K-pop idol and reborn as an artist, Suga  raps, \[...\] A new record is a fight with oneself/ Make a toast and one  shot/ And yet, Im still as thirsty as ever.

 Further showing their penchant for Greek mythology and philosophy, BTS  liken their fans individuality and diversity to stars in Mikrokosmos,  a name borrowed from the Greek philosophical concept that each human  being contains entire worlds inside them. Its an airy, twinkling pop  anthem made for stadium encores, much like *Love Yourself: Answer*s [Answer: Love Myself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwRYgMmSGE)  Then theres Jamais Vu, named after the opposite of dj vu, in  which a person is faced with a situation theyve seen many times but  cant seem to remember. While its sonically a soaring ballad  and  shows off eldest member Jin's often underrated vocal stability  the  lyrics reveal it to be one of *Map of the Soul*: *Personas* darkest moments, as members Jin, Jungkook, and J-Hope describe reliving the same pains over and over and begging for a remedy. 

Nobody has been nearly as crucial to the championing of BTS as [ARMY](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/227199/bts-map-of-the-soul-persona-new-album-theories) has, and in the end, *Map of the Soul*: *Persona*  is a gift for the fans. Sprinkled throughout, the EP has references  that only BTS insiders would know and recycled sounds that may seem out  of place to first time listeners, but draw excitement for those who take  time to dive into the bands history a bit deeper. Like [*Wings* 2! 3!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZyFo_xrsyk) and [*Love Yourself: Tears* Magic Shop,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38k5zr1e0HI) *Map of the Soul*: *Personas*  most poignant ARMY-dedicated song is smooth R&amp;B track HOME, a  metaphor for the comfort they find in the love from their fans. The  world thinks weve got everything in it/ The big house, big car, big  rings of dreams, raps Suga, directly referencing what he yearned for in  their [2013 debut single No More Dream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBG5L7UsUxA)  Even If I possess all the things I want/ Im still somewhat empty now  \[...\] But a door I exit because I have a place to return, even if I  leave.

BTS know theyre on top of the world, and are no doubt hungry for more. But with *Map of the Soul*: *Persona*,  the septet make it clear they arent trying to just fit in, and if they  do reach to even higher heights, it will be on their own terms. The  only people in their way of climbing higher are themselves.",5,92,False,self,,,,,

That being said, with a larger focus on BTS as artists and musicians rather than some trend, a lot of people are now talking about their musicality, how it's groundbreaking, how it's not enough, how it's evolving with every new iteration of the group, etc.

Personally, I find myself using the word ""maximalism"" to describe BTS' signature sound.

The official translation is really good, and I think it does a great job on conveying the meaning of the lyrics.

However, sometimes, since the Korean grammar is different than the English grammar, the translation changes the sentence structures to make the texts flow more smoothly. But doing so, while it delivers the same meaning, it looses some \*feelings\* that a sentence can deliver they way it's structured. 

It's not a great example, but ""Hurriedly, I left the cold stadium to see you"", ""I left the freezing hall in hurry in order to see you"", and ""To get to you, I left the cold stadium in hurry"" mean the same thing and deliver the same information, but they don't \*feel\* the same.

So, I decided to make my own translation for BOY WITH LUV to preserve the feeling I get from the lyrics as much as possible.

Also, I tried to write down the ambiguity I get from the Korean lyrics too, so you guys can also experience that too.

So it won't flow as smoothly, but I think it captures what I felt when I was reading the lyrics more.

\*\*A Poem for the Little Ones (BOY WITH LUV) \*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious about everything: How's your day.

Oh, tell me (Oh yeah oh yeah, ah yeah ah yeah)

On what makes you happy

Oh , text me (Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah)

&amp;#x200B;

Your every picture

I want to keep it by my bedside oh bae\^1

Come be my teacher

Teach me your everything

Your one, your two

&amp;#x200B;

\[A\]

Listen my my baby I am

Flying in that sky up high

(With the two WINGS you gave me back then)

Now, it's too high up here

I want to fit you in my eyes\^2

Yeah you makin' me a boy with luv

&amp;#x200B;

\[B\]

Oh my my my oh my my my

I've waited all my lift

I want to be together for your everything\^3

Oh my my my oh my my my

Looking for something right

Now, I get it a little

&amp;#x200B;

I want something stronger

Than a moment, than a moment, love

I have waited longer

For a boy with

For a boy with luv

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I've known you, ya, my lift is entirely you, ya

A star called you have made the little things not little\^4

From one to ten\^5 everything is special

From your interests, the way you walk, the way you talk, to the little habits

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone says that I, who used to be very small, have became a hero (Oh nah)

Then I say that the destiny or whatever wasn't mine at the first place (Oh nah)

The world's peace (No way)

The great harmony (No way)\^6

I'll just protect you

(Boy with luv)

&amp;#x200B;

\[A\]

&amp;#x200B;

\[B\]

&amp;#x200B;

\[C\]

Love is nothing stronger

Than a boy with luv

Love is nothing stronger

Than a boy with luv

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be honest with you

Sometimes, without having realized, I got cocky\^5

Sky that got higher, the hall that bigger

Sometimes, I prayed ""Let me just run away""

But, your scar is my scar

When I realized that, I promised that

With the wings of Icarus you gave

Not to the Sun, but to you

Let me fly

&amp;#x200B;

\[B\]

&amp;#x200B;

\[C\]

&amp;#x200B;

\^1 The direct translation is ""I want to put it on topside of my head"".  means on the head side when one's lying down. That basically means one's bedside. I assume that that expression derived from how Koreans used to sleep on the floor and used to put things that one might need on the topside of the head. 

&amp;#x200B;

\^2 1 means ""Putting the things that are apart together making them touching each other"". It has a connotation of being right and fitting.

1. It can mean that he wants to put the image of you in his eyes in just the right way.

2.    (Putting the eyes on the same level/ meeting the eye level) means changing your perspective so you can communicate with the others or understand the others better. So, he wants to understand you and get to know you better because he's tired of being up high.

3.   (Eyes got matched/ Seeing each other in the eyes at the same time) means ""share the same feeling"" and ""fall in love"". So basically, he wants to fall in love with you.

&amp;#x200B;

\^3 I know it's not smooth. More smooth translation would be ""I want to be with you for everything"" or ""I want to share your every moment"". And also, more direct translation would be ""I want to do your everything together"". But, in Korean,  (Doing side by side/ together) means sharing a moment or being with someone. I wanted to leave that feeling in the sentence. 

&amp;#x200B;

\^4 This sentence doesn't sound conversational at all. More smooth translation would be something like ""You are the start that made.."". However, "" "" feels poetic meaning ""A star, you are"" or ""a star called you"". ""You are the star"" feels poetic enough but that can be directly translated into "" "" which feels far less poetic. I wanted to keep the same sentiment from the original lyrics even though it's not as smooth.

&amp;#x200B;

\^5 "" "" translates into ""From one to ten"", and it's a Korean idiom for ""everything"". A common usage is when your boss yell at you ""Do I have to tell you \*everything\*?"" (Do I have to tell you from one to ten?). Since he list out the the little things that she does, I thought it's a fun parallel structure where he ""enumerate"" (one to ten) and list out the things. 

&amp;#x200B;

\^6 "" "" can be directly translated into ""Big Order"" which means ""Great Order"". However, when it's said in Korean, it makes you think about the mother nature or the ways of the universe that overwhelms you. However in English, ""the great order"" personally sounds authoritarian. So I thought ""the great harmony"" depicts the connotation better. Also, ""the world's peace"" is a direct translation of "" "". I could put ""the world peace"" which is """" in Korean. However since he put "" "" where he could have put """", I decided to put ""the world's peace"".

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't put what I think the lyrics mean, represent, and symbolize, because that's up to the interpretation, and I'm sure you know about that more than me.

But I would love to talk about Singularity today.

There's stg special about this song. 
Whenever I listen to it, I just feel like I'm going through some journey.

1st listen: okay cool, i'm feeling the vibe.
Surprisingly it's so cool to sing along. Because when I first listened to it, I didn't get it was singing or not.

2nd listen: wait! Why is it getting darker?

3rd listen: i just feel that bittersweetness in spiritual level. I sing it while crying/almost close to cry. It just hits the spot.

The thing is, this happens exactly with this order whenever I listen to that song. Eventho I have experienced it like multiple times already. It's so weird! Because I've never experienced stg like this before. 

For example, Last makes me as I am going through a whole journey &amp; gets me straight in a second. And it's so dark I can't listen to it often. But the 'feeling' 'content' is same. 
While with Singularity, it's the same song but it doesn't feel like that at all.

I'm curious about the BTS' song you want to highlight today and what it made in you :) Please share it with me!",18,36,False,self,,,,,

The films theme revolves around the self and the part of ourselves that differentiate ourselves from other people.

At first I really failed to see how the ""Persona"" idea was related to most of the tracks on this album. I'll paraphrase what several members have said about the album's themes as ""just getting to know someone as a step in the process of truly loving them."" Then I had an ""epiphany"" (haha) and the connection between that idea and the Jungian persona finally hit me. When Jimin and V express how they want to know everything about you at the start of Boy With Luv, they're asking about your personas. This is an early step in true love, and we're trying to get to know the other person at face value. The complicated stuff comes later. But BTS has already been very clear that loving yourself means loving all of yourself, and this applies to loving another person. A persona is not a shameful thing, or an obstacle, it's something to love, too.

Now, another huge part of this album is all of the overt references it makes to BTS's past work. BTS has always had a line of progression in their themes and I think it's kind of a trademark for them to build off of past ideas in a nuanced way. But this album in particular really makes a point of these references, and I think that point is kind of obvious. Their past works are their personas. I think a lot of people kinda got this when the intro dropped, but the really cool thing I see now is how I think this ties in to the process of true love. There's a lot of lines throughout the album that have much more meaning when you get the past works they refer to, and I think the audience is encouraged to try to catch all these references. It's a process of getting to know someone you love, in this case BTS. You actually simulate that process that the album is about. BTS express their desire to do this, and ARMYs reciprocate by knowing them well enough already. This is actually really incredible to me.

Problem - they want us to line up 1.5 hours before 2pm. 

1) Can I have a friend line up for me?

2) Can I have my friend take the photo with me?

3) If no to (1) or (2) if I come 30 Minutes before the closing of my window ... can I still take the photo? I thought these were express passes so I didn't have to wait so long (from reading briefly that other people with passes just went straight through to take photos. 

4) Lastly - Ill be landing with luggage and taking a lyft/uber. I know I cant enter the stadium with luggage but will taking my luggage temporarily into the Studio photo area be an issue? I assume note because of Merch buyers?

The feed for the MCD comeback show was so crowded and I just wanted to make a thread here on the sub to talk about the absolutely insane performance we just witnessed. I personally feel as though I was stabbed and then ressurected in my own metal-inspired greek tragedy. 

Also to talk about some specifics, the production of that performance is insane. I watched it again (a 6th time) just watching the background dancers. They're incredibly smooth and the way they move sets/tables/chairs/props in and out is insane they just melt into the background which is especially impressive for a live performance. 

I think this is the most theatric BTS has ever been outside maybe the MAMA Blood Sweat and Tears performance in 2016, and this was a comeback show not a year end stage. But the way the choreography is built around the the props, the chairs, the table (god the table dancing was so hype??? How do you make sitting look so exciting), Joon's staff at the beginning, the capes, the stairs that Suga decended from like an appropriately drunk god. 

I'm just reeling from what I witnessed, what an amazing performance of a fucking B - SIDE TRACK. 

We are so lucky, so blessed to have such artistry and effort put before us.

Also RM went so hard and if a fancam of him in this doesn't blow up we've gotta reevaluate some priorities.

For example,

21st Century Girl - Forever associated with Yoongi because of his ""Don't worry, Don't worry, baby you're beautiful"". 

Cypher Pt. 4 - Hobi because of his subtle ""hm"" at the end of his verse. Also [his dance](https://youtu.be/XNqzIPmIDh8) which I take to be official choreo.

Run - Literally can't listen to it without doing Jin's dance from [this encore stage](https://youtu.be/n-pNeIDF9-o) around 2:51

Fire - Yoongi and Jimin because they OWN the live performances

Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears - Jungkook because [""peaches and cream, sweeter than sweet""](https://youtu.be/hESuPkykRc4)

Pied Piper - Yoongi, Jimin, Joon because [body rolls](https://youtu.be/cjFnL3KEGWs) around 3:48

Cypher Pt. 3 - have to dab throughout the entire song [thanks to Tae](https://youtu.be/AcK1wN8fUcs) around 2:40

Anpanman - Jimin and Joon because of [their antics this tour](https://youtu.be/jD98yufK5p8)

Guys, I am kind new/old to the fandom world of Bts. Frankly, speaking 2018 summer or so, I got myself into kpop. And joined the fandom world of Bts. But, the most confusing thing for me is how do I show that am a fan too. For example, you guys know how fans draw the boys, know the fan chants, some fans know the dances to all their songs but, I cannot do any of those things. So, I figure I might get some ideas to contribute by you guys. For example, I was thinking about writing poems or something because I daydream a lot about things that will never happen. For instance, imagining Bts being my seniors or classmates and meeting them weirdly and planning to ship the boys to together like crazy! imagine them being gay Af and hiding it from their fans. I think I am about to cry like hell for sure right thinking about the possibilities.

Their songs, mixtapes, SoundCloud songs, personalities, shows (Run BTS, Bon Voyage), tweets, MVs, Bangtan Bombs, &amp; performances just breathe so much life into me. 

I'm a high school senior, so I had to write college apps.. and I seriously couldn't have pushed through with writing all 16 essays without them in my life. I was accepted to my dream colleges last month, and this was all thanks to BTS and just their profound messages they put into everything they do. 

Like I just start tearing up just thinking of them. They went through so much to get to where they are today.. and just thinking about the journey I had with them for 6 years hand-in-hand makes me cry for hours and hours.

She was asked about the fancafe. And she was talking about ""terms"" used in fancafe.
In no way, she was saying that people who are not in fancafe are non-ARMYs/not offcial ARMY!

And I would like to sum up most opinions here:
- The vocal line all have unique and potential voices but their techniques dont live up to their reputation right now
- Have a good live singing doesnt mean they have a good technique
- If they continue to sing like this, their voices can be seriously damaged in the near future
 Personally, as a fan, I can clearly see that they started as a hip hop group so the vocal lines of BTS certainly didnt receive vocal lessons methodically. And I can deny that every times they perform in some important events such as: BBMAs, SNL,.., I always have to hold my breath until they finished. Because I'm afraid that they could make mistakes and seeing they blaming themselves is uneasy for me. And what I worry the most is that seems like they are damaging their precious voices. All my favourite songs like fake love, the truth untold,.. sometimes I can clearly see them struggle to perform it. 
 But there is a truth that they are improving and gaining more confidence tho so cant wait to see what will happen in the future. 
Still want them to take proper lessons 
What do you think? Just want to know your point of views. And English is not my first language so sometimes I can fully express my opinions but I welcome all contributed advices from all of you ",95,0,False,self,,,,,

Hope I can receive the contributed ones. Here is what she thinks about it:
""After writing an analysis about HRI economic influence of Bangtan, suddenly I think about K-media
This is just my personal opinion, not base on any official material but my own observation and objective thinking. I write it down to express my point of view so anyone can read but dont carp at me or bring it too far
You all know Korea try to promote Hallyu as an export product bringing a huge profit, and Hallyu includes: k-pop, k-drama, k-show,etc.. When I rewatched the awards that Bangtan received from departments or associations, all of them are because Bangtan have helped to boost the Hallyu wave. And I think this is a partial reason why 1-2 years ago K-media ( and international- media getting press release from Korean) always published news about BTS along with some other group names. Actually, I usually tend to seperate BTS's achievements from Kpop but its hard to win a mind game with that kind of bombard from K-media saying the different things, like everyone said the same things so it became a fact. Now it barely happens because BTS's reputation is impossible to hold back, people can obviously see through the tricks that the media uses. 
Consider according to economic aspect, once BTS takes a step back, if there is noone  to be acknowledged by foreign countries with the same level, Korea economy will face the risk of losing billions dollars based on HRI reports. And we can clearly see the big companies always have media supports, yeah investing there will be safer, we cant always have a nugu group becoming extremely famous like BTS. 
And why do K-media tend to focus more about scandals rather than achievements? Its not just about view or clickbaits, maybe they afraid that BTS reputation would be out of control of Kpop purview, so they should do something to restrain their influence and push other groups ( push lot of groups and see which one GP would welcome so they can PR them) .Even Billboard asked BTS to mention some groups but Namjoon and Yoongi were smart tho lmao. Recently, a next BTS question asked in their press was like a trap. And despite Yoongi sincere answer (makes us feel super proud), it may mess up someone intention.
This is just two faces of this kind d system: saying all these are for the sake of general benefits but we can never really know what they gonna do, or even do it publicly but we can do nothing about it. Except for something which is extremely huge that they cant reach and control. 
So the fact that BTS has brought enormous economic value is a thing we should be proud but we should also see it in some other aspects. The relation between BTS and Korea is so much more complicated than we imagine. Stan Bangtan but if Korea has any scheme to grab foreign currency ( although our pure purposes are loving Bangtan so we choose to support Korean products), we shoud stay lucid.
In conclusion, stan Bangtan and Korea is two different things. 
Yeah its midnight here already. To put it simple, I love Bangtan and trust present Bighit. My money are all for BTS and Bighit, noone should touch my money lmao.""

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to throw this out to the community because I know those of us who are looking for tickets to see our boys want to have the best seats possible. I was just browsing Stub Hub for floor tickets for one of the shows, and came across a set of 3 tickets for $300 a piece in a section RIGHT next to the stage. Naturally, I went to snag them, but thought I would check Ticketmaster first to see exactly where the row is. Turns out, the tickets were for row 4, which does not actually exist according to Ticketmaster's site. So, I decided to call Ticketmaster and ask them if there was a row 4 in that section, and according to the representative I spoke with - there isn't!

&amp;#x200B;

I know cheap prices for tickets can be SUPER tempting, but just  make sure to listen to your instincts and if you aren't sure about something, it never hurts to double check and save yourself from heartbreak in the end!",32,82,False,self,,,,,

Today I've found ""I like it"", it's really a gem for me. I had an experience similar to the theme in the song: I had a girl I was close to, but we weren't going out (because I was too shy to confess), but we were really, really close (I think if I did confess, we would go out 100%). Ultimately, we had an argument, after that we didn't talk anymore. Usually, I'll try to reconcile after some days, but my pride was hurt so I was waiting for an apology from her. It never happened. The worst thing is that I was still upset after a lot of time (altogether for a year, but after first 6 months not as much).

At first I was angry, later I was hopeful? (that she'll write to me, at least something). After around 2-3 months I've started re-reading our chat history, thinking like ""is it too late to apologise? Should I? Do I need it?"" and other questions. As for her, I understood that she didn't bother with it for a long time as I did. Maybe 1-2 weeks, max a month. It really hurt.

So, during the time beetwen 3 and 6 months after the argument, I was checking her page, not quite contemplating whether should I place my like or not, but is she well nowadays? Doesn't she really care? Did she forgot already?

...

After finding this song today, it's brought back some of my memories. Funny thing though, for me the music theme of the song is soft after-melancholy (don't know it that makes sense). I mean, when it brought back memories, they weren't painful or something like that, it just felt like a refreshing look in the past with, finally, resolving some things I gave up contemplating back then. Now it feels kinda special, wanna immerse myself into it for some more time.

It was my second time when a BTS's song felt really special to me so much (the first was with Save Me).

She's not really the type to engage in fan/stan culture (streaming, knowing a lot about the members, buying albums, etc), but I really want her to get to know the members because they bring so much joy to me and I'm hoping they can make her smile too.

I know from experience that bon voyage is not something that people who aren't fans will enjoy watching because I tried to watch with my sister (she likes their music but doesn't engage in fan culture either) and she thought it was boring ;; mainly because she doesn't know the members individually and it's basically like watching a bunch of strangers go on vacation if you're not an army.

I'm considering giving her episodes of Run! to watch, but they tend to use a lot of Korean humor, which I'm not sure if she will find funny (I feel like she likes more western humor) and I can't really figure out which episode would be the best to show her first.

Help would be very appreciated!

There's a translation posted in the thread. 

It's really interesting considering BTS has the most hot 100 entries, achieved the highest ranks, and also the longest weeks spent on the charts yet they're nowhere to be found.

It just made me think of posting on this subreddit considering the discussion about BTS and k-media relationship posted a while back.

Practically every day there is always someone lamenting that their schedule is too busy and the boys arent getting enough rest.

And to that I say. What is enough rest to you? 

I mean, granted, when they are in full promo mode their schedule can be full on. And as an outsider, it looks overwhelming.

But I also believe that this is what they train and prepare themselves for. Its their everyday job. Whether its practicing, working in the studio on new music or doing a photo shoot. 

And I also believe they have down time. Time to see friends and family. Time to go for long walks or take up new hobbies. We have ample evidence of this. Whether its them sharing it themselves or other sharing. Especially recently. Ive gotten a sense that they got a better work/life balance lately.

So, in my opinion, yes, they work very hard. But they are passionate about the work they do. And they do have time to rest and enjoy life out of the spotlight.

Since listening to it, its become a hobby of mine to make playlists which, like LY:A tell some sort of narratives. If you could make a story from BTS songs, which songs would you use, and whats the story?

I created a story based off of an experience with a friend. In the story, the protagonist has unknowingly wronged their friend. At first, theyre pitiful and pleading, desiring the warmth of that friendship again, but unwilling to sacrifice their pride. Then, they realize its not just the friendship theyve lost, but a person theyve hurt, too, and in their selfishness, they failed to empathize with their friends position. Finally, they find the will to apologize for their wrongdoings. Although at this point, the friendship may be irreparable, and both miss the way things were before, but both are thankful to have known eachother, thankful for the memories.

Feel free to provide a recipe for other ARMY as well! (If your great-grandma lets you that is...)

I show my love by feeding people homemade sweets and comfort food, so I was imagining if I had one chance to serve the boys, what would I pick and why.

Mine would be Chocolate Sour Cream Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting! Its my best recipe, as Im horrible at cooking but love to bake. Theyre fluffy yet rich, and cupcakes are highly customizable and decorative!

**Chocolate Cupcakes:** 
Makes 18 regular cupcakes!

3 oz  unsweetened chocolate, chopped
1 cup  all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp  baking powder
1/2 tsp  baking soda
1/4 tsp  salt
1/2 cup (1 stick)  unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups  sugar
2  large eggs
1  tsp  vanilla extract
1/2 cup  sour cream
1/2 cup  water

Preheat oven to 350F.  Line muffin pan with cupcake liners. 

Melt chocolate (using double boiler or [microwave](https://bakerbettie.com/how-to-melt-chocolate-in-the-microwave/)) and set aside to cool slightly.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together and set aside.
In large bowl, beat butter and sugar until creamy. Mix in melted chocolate then add eggs one at a time. Add vanilla and beat until color has lightened slightly. Fold in sour cream until no white streaks remain. Add half the dry mixture, mixing until *just* incorporated. Mix in water, then the remaining dry mixture until batter is smooth. 

Fill prepared cupcake liners with about 1/4th cup (ice cream scoop makes a great measuring tool) batter. Bake until tops are firm and a toothpick comes out clean, about 20~ minutes. Cool ten minutes in the pan, transfer cakes out of pan to cool completely then frost!

**Cream Cheese Frosting:**
Makes 3 cups!

1/2 cup (1 stick)  unsalted butter, at room temperature
6 oz  cream cheese, at room temperature
1 tsp  vanilla extract
3 cups  confectioners sugar

Beat butter, cream cheese and vanilla until smooth. Mix in confectioners sugar, then beat until light in color and fluffy. Add food color if desired or leave as is!

I think it would be cool to have the cupcakes decorated like their albums! Black sprinkles and red frosting for Dark &amp; Wild, a cupcake for each circle of the Wings album, white frosting with a shaky chocolate drizzle for Mono etc...",177,52,False,self,,,,,

They emailed me and out of nowhere started selling SO MANY tickets and im very confused. Most of them are what they called verified resell tickets, some have okay pricing, others are ridiculous like $500 for not even floor. Theres also some blue dots left which are tickets that havent been sold to anyone yet. Theres no floor seats left for either date though. I was very shocked to see how many seats are currently up for resell and now Im worried that theyll be a bunch of empty seats come concert night :((( Is this a common occur for kpop/concerts to have ticketmaster suddenly list such a high number of resell tickets? It seems like 1/3+ of the seats are for sale right now. 

Idk if im somehow being dumb and messing up this info, but I think Im right? Someone fact check me on this please, and sorry in advance if Im wrong. However the upside is if you rly wanted tickets but werent able to get them, nows your chance! If you click around enough you should find some less outrageously priced seats.

#Announcement  
 
Due to how fast BTS is growing, the mod team has decided to only do special events for special numbers of subscribers - meaning the next special sub event will be for 100k! This is because its actually quite difficult to come up with new and different prompts every month or two...but you can always look back at all our previous events, [as they are all listed in the wiki!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index#wiki_subscriber_milestone_events)    
 
We will still post these greeting threads every 10k subscribers for now, though if we grow too rapidly we might decide to space those out more too! ;)

More specifically, about leaving the concert afterward and the bag rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I saw them in Oakland and the stadium in a bit of a sketchy area, but I had family to pick me up. This year I'll be going alone and was wondering how safe the area around the stadium is and what the best way to get back to my hotel would be. Is there public transportation that's close by or would it be better to use Uber/Lyft? If I use Uber it would probably be cheaper to first walk a block or two away to avoid the traffic, but is it safe to do that? I'm really not familiar with the area at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I've read that backpacks aren't allowed into the concert, but that they have tents that you can store your bag at. Does anyone know if that's true and how reliable that would be? I have an early flight back home, and I'm debating whether I should go straight to the airport after the concert or book another night at the hotel. It would be cheaper just to go straight to the airport, but if they aren't able to store my bag for any reason I would be screwed.",1,2,False,self,,,,,

I know the tracking week for Gaon is Monday-Tuesday, so this is technically BTS second week tracking. Would it have been higher if BTS released on Monday and it was tracked from day 1-day 7 of release rather than getting a day 4-day 11 full week tracking? 
The reason why Im asking is its the third highest digital week behind Taeyeon and Bol4 (which is phenomenal), but they released on a regular tracking period so Im guessing (?) they had a bigger advantage. 
Or Im wrong and it wouldnt have made a difference.

They already gained 23M digital points just from less than half of a week tracking from Friday-Monday.",0,10,False,self,,,,,

He said he got alerts on his phone from Apple and news outlets, and he saw it all over the news. He then talked with me for about 30 minutes about the group and showed genuine interest in the phenomenon while asking a lot of questions. I think the SNL appearance was the tipping point.

My husband went to a job interview. He told them he'd be out of town in a few weeks. They asked where he was going. He told them. They asked why, and he said a concert. They asked for who, and he said, ""BTS."" One interviewer asked who that was, and the other said, ""They were on SNL recently."" They were both men.

A main point in the answer was how the quality of their music was a result from friendly competition in their dynamic, this is taken from the post:

(...On the one hand, you have to be sincerely happy for your associates when they write and perform something great.

On the other hand, you have to feel inspired to do something just as great, if not greater, and not be intimidated. You have to believe that YOU CAN DO IT TOO.

Human nature being what it is, these qualities dont often go together. People lose themselves in petty feelings of jealousy, envy, and frustration...)

I couldnt help but think of BTS. When I first became an ARMY, it stood out to me how genuinely happy for each other they were, how the successes of their members inspired them instead of making them jealous, and how every single member embodied this mentality. 

Sorry for this long post, but I was wondering how you think special aspects of BTSs dynamic have played a role in their success.

If BTS *are* going on the show, it most likely won't be announced until two weeks prior to the taping - which is definitely too late to get tickets for the show.

When BTS were on Graham Norton last year, not a lot of ARMYs managed to get tickets because by the time their appearance was confirmed, most of the tickets were already taken by non-fans who had applied earlier. So the handful of ARMYs that managed to get in, got in by pure luck from the waiting list (and therefore the boys didn't have that much support in the audience).

**I think it's** ***very*** **likely BTS will be on the show again to promote ""Boy With Luv"" - either on the taping on the 30th of May or the 6th of June.** Both dates are Thursdays, and I think the 30th of May date is the most likely date for their appearance, but feel free to put the 6th of June as your second preference just in case.

The 30th of May is four days after their Brazil concert and two days before their UK concert, whereas the 6th of June is four days after their UK concert but just one day before their France concert (so it's possible, but less likely). Aim for the 30th of May. Of course, BTS *could* end up not being on the show at all... but better safe than sorry? The Graham Norton Show taping information:

**The venue** is Television Centre, White City, West London W12 7FA  
**The nearest station is** White City tube  
**The doors open at** 6.15pm

The minimum age for the show is 18 years.

I hear things a little differently then many people because I have an auditory processing disorder which means (simplified) that I can hear mostly everything but I don't always understand what I'm hearing. I like to say I hear things in a unique way though!

It takes me a longer time to really hear songs like Dionysus for example because there are a lot of sounds to hear. There are some songs that I appreciate so much because they sound good on first listen. 

4 o Clock is actually my favorite first listen song ever. It sounds so clean and I didn't struggle with it even a bit and to this day, even if I'm super tired it sounds amazing.

I want to say at the outset that this is going to be an incomplete history because theres a lot that happened in these three years that we simply dont know about. This is also going to be way more detailed about the rap line than the vocal line because the rap line members were the only ones really in the public eye until the end of 2012.

Im going to try and stick as close to the facts as I can and Im going to try and really clearly mark anything thats speculation (this will mostly be in part 2). Ill try to be mostly chronological but I may have to jump around a bit because not everything is firmly dated. 

Also as I was writing this up it seemed too big for one post so Im going to divide it into 2 (?) parts. This portion will cover the early formation of Bangtan until the start of the second Hit It! Auditions.

**Brief Overview:**

These posts is going to get long and unwieldy, so heres some basics:

1. Bangtan first officially appeared in August 2010 with only Namjoon and Jung Huncheol (Iron) revealed as members. Namjoon had joined Big Hit in May 2010. I have no info on when Iron joined except that it was after Namjoon.

2. Bangtan was originally abbreviated as B.P.B which came from their English name, Bullet Proof Boys (No boy scouts at this point). The switch to BTS as the abbreviation happened mid 2011 with the release of Satoori Rap

3. There were about 30 trainees for Bangtan but not all of them were ever in the official line up. The official members were: Namjoon, Iron, Shin Donghyuck (Supreme Boi), Choi Ikje (i11evn), Yoongi, Hoseok, and someone named Park Yeong-man that I have no other information on other than he was older than 94 line.

4. Bangtan featured on five official tracks in 2010-2011, always credited as Bangtan (rather than the members names) and Namjoon was on all five. Hoseok also featured on Jo Kwons Animal in 2012 and was credited as Jung Hoseok of BTS.

5. Bangtan also released a few tracks during this time including, We are B.P.B (later reworked into We are Bullet Proof Pt 1) and Hook Gayo

&amp;#x200B;

**2010  Mid 2011 B.P.B**

Bangtans existence began with a [night of drinking](http://tonguetechnology.blogspot.com/2016/12/interview-idol-maker-pdogg-producer.html) between Big Hit producer Pdogg and Sleepy, a rapper from the duo Untouchable. Pdogg is actually a rapper as well, though I dont think hes done much of it since Bangtans debut. Over drinks, Sleepy asked Pdogg if he wanted to hear a really talented high school aged rapper he knew and when Pdogg agreed Sleepy played him some of Namjoons underground stuff. By this time, Namjoon was actually on a bit of a hiatus from rapping and focusing on his school work (I have another post that goes through his [pre-debut work as Runch Randa here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/b4p5ok/rm_predebut_history/)). 

Pdogg was impressed enough that he played the songs for Bang PD and Bang PD told him to have Namjoon come in for an audition. Namjoon came in and apparently signed a contract immediately after his audition.

There doesnt seem to have been [any real plan](https://kpopduck.com/post/168890283183/idol-maker-bang-shi-hyuk-ceo-a-company-that/amp?__twitter_impression=true) in place at the beginning. Bang PD mentioned in an early interview that they didnt have any trainee system in place at the time, didnt have any vetting period for trainees, didnt have any dorms to stay in. Basically, they seem to have signed Namjoon and then tried to figure out everything else after that.

[In a 2017 interview](https://twitter.com/JK_Glitters/status/936450614468464641), Bang PD said he wanted to make a hip hop group with Namjoon at it's center and that that idea later morphed into an idol group as the years went on. (I've seen some bts history posts in the past claim that Iron was the original leader but I've never found any evidence to support that claim which I assume is only based on the fact that Iron was older than Namjoon. But considering this interview, the fact Namjoon is the first member, the only member on all pre-debut tracks, and was confirmed by an ex-trainee Jihoon to have been the leader since before Jihoon joined in summer 2011, I think its safe to say that Namjoon was the leader from the start.)

Between May and August, Namjoon would go to Big Hit after school and then later go back home. When Big Hit got their first dorm for male trainees in August, he was the first to move in. Im not sure if Iron ever stayed in the dorms or not. Im also not sure how early Supreme Boi joined though he was definitely in the group by September 13th, 2010. It could be that Namjoon was the only person actually in the dorm at first. 

*SLIGHT TANGENT*: According to Namjoons lyrics in Move, 9 trainees stayed in the dorms, but Im not sure if hes counting everyone that was ever in the dorms or if hes talking about a specific period of time when the dorm had 9 trainees in it. Jihoon, a former Bangtan trainee, lived in the dorms before Jin moved in. If Namjoon meant 9 total trainees, then only one more member would have ever been in the dorms (However, I tend toward the interpretation that the song is referencing a specific point in time when 9 trainees lived in the dorms so I don't know how many trainees in total stayed in the dorms).

**The First Hit It! Audition**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lox54r23wvu21.png

Bangtan was first revealed to the public on August 30th 2010 with promotions for the first Hit It! Auditions. The two revealed members were Namjoon and Iron. The fancafe was opened for the group at the same time. 

Namjoon and Iron were billed as having underground experience and the group was advertised as a hip hop crew. But at least from the comments on HipHopPlaya, Namjoon seems to be the only one people knew of. 

Iron also came from the same academy in Gwangju as Hoseok so its possible Big Hit may have picked Iron up through them. [Pdogg mentioned](http://tonguetechnology.blogspot.com/2016/12/interview-idol-maker-pdogg-producer.html) that after getting Namjoon they looked at a lot of people like Beenzino and Basick before holding the first open auditions.

Along with photos of Namjoon and Iron, they released two solo tracks apiece. Namjoons were [Seventeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfy1Pf8CL18) and [Dreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbOPBbj7QUo) and Irons were [Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STL-RY_kR00) and [ING.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUdTqk6vkt4) Contestants for the Hit It auditions were required to use the music from one of these four tracks and write and perform their own rap about school life or a societal problem.

&amp;#x200B;

[Directions for participating in the first Hit It Auditions](https://i.redd.it/13bs2coowvu21.jpg)



Contestants then needed to upload a video of them performing their song to Daum TV (which unfortunately shut down last year so all the old videos are lost) or go to one of the auditions in person. 

[Yoongis entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBwBU2w5ddI) used the music from Namjoons Seventeen.

After being filmed, the entries were uploaded for people to vote on on a site/app called Love Beat. Yoongis performance came in first place and he along with two other people from the Love Beat voting were selected by the judges to go to the Hit It! Finals. Yoongi is credited on the poster for the finals as Love Beat first place winner Min Yoongi and Ikje is credited as the Daum TV first place winner. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Poster for Hit It! Final Yoongi is credited as \\""Love Beat 1st place Min Yoongi\\"" \(top left on under the Rap-Battle Tournament heading\)](https://i.redd.it/py6lbv6xwvu21.jpg)

 

The Hit It Finals were held on October 24th at NB2 in Hongdae. The format was a rap battle and according to the poster Yoongi and Ikje were seeded opposite each other and faced off in the final round. 8eight (a co-ed group made up of Lee Hyun, Joo Hee, and Baek Chan), San E, and Bangtan (by this time 3 members with Supreme Boi added) were there and Bangtan performed afterward.

Yoongi placed second to Ikje in the rap battle but was promising enough that Big Hit took him in anyway (only 1st place was guaranteed a spot). Theres footage of [them performing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdW0M0fRnc4) at the club that night, and both of them later re-recorded their raps. Yoongis [Swagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=kdAV7tJf0Pg) and [Diss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmG1EhBntCA) both come from this night.

The Diss re-recording also has an additional line. In the live performance Yoongi ended by saying it was obvious he won. In the re-recording he adds a line saying but I lost. Damn.

**Early Song Releases and Features**

Backing up to September 13th, 2010, Bangtan released their first group track, [Hook Gayo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VfI6gKATdU) (sometimes also called Brave Brothers Diss Track). Namjoon, Iron, and Supreme Boi were all on this track. 

The track was a response to an earlier track by Brave Brothers (who is 1 person not a group) that had dissed Bang PD among others. 

About 2 weeks later on September 30th, 2010 the group had their first official featuring on Lim Jeong-Hees [Ashes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxw8SuvmzI) RM and Iron were the two members that featured on the song and wrote their own raps, but only the group as a whole was credited on KOMCA (the Korean music copyright association). All of the early promotion and features on 2010-2011 only ever credited the group as a whole, much like how Waste It On Me was billed as a BTS feature despite only having Namjoon and Jungkook.

Ashes is also the source of the very first [Bangtan Bomb/Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyIQi-dgs-Y) which is a short video of Namjoon and Iron working with Lim Jeong-Hee to record the track.

Then on October 12th 2010 they released [We Are B.P.B.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCQ1x0eonKI) This song gets often confused with [We Are Bullet Proof Pt. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzP7nJ5tovY) which reworked this song and was released on Soundcloud by the group in 2015 in preparation for the BTS Begins concert. Namjoons part was kept in the new version but split between him and Jungkook. Supreme Bois and Irons were dropped and new lyrics added. What makes it even funnier is that Yoongi then reused his new verse in We are Bullet Proof Pt. 1 in [Agust D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y_Eiyg4bfk) a year later.

On October 26th 2010, Bangtan featured on 2AMs [Love U Hate U.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OevG2kTdorY) RM, Supreme Boi, and Iron were all featured in the song, though Supreme Boi and Irons verses were split in half (i.e. they got 4 lines each while Namjoon had the typical 8). Im not sure if theirs were smaller for musical reasons or if its because Supreme Boi was a late addition to the track.

&amp;#x200B;

[Original Bangtan logo](https://i.redd.it/sk9d69awyvu21.jpg)

The lyric video for the song also features the earliest Bangtan logo, which will change twice more before they officially debut in 2013. As you can see it uses the initials B.P.B and the English name is Bullet Proof Boys. (Not the Boyz that Bang PD had used in his earlier tweet about them).

In a diss song to DNH released in November 2010, BPB is also mentioned (Note: even though its called a diss song, the lyrics were actually pretty complimentary for the most part which was why the song was titled, Is This Diss?). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Verse by \\""Gravy Train\\"" from \\""Is this Diss\\"" the relevant lines are translated below \(starting from 7th line\)](https://i.redd.it/56dyb1yezvu21.png)

Namjoon also name drops representing BPB in the DNH song Rollin from around August 2011 (though I suspect the song is older than that, I havent found any postings of it before then). The name change from BPB to BTS seems to roughly coincide with the shift from a hip hop crew to a hip hop idol group.

After winning a place in the Hit It Auditions, Yoongi moved into the dorms in November 2010 and Hoseok joined in December 2010 (The date on his helmet for Dope is a reference to his dorm move in date). 

&amp;#x200B;

[2010.12.24 is the date Hoseok moved into the Bangtan dorms](https://i.redd.it/8td2hjpg0wu21.png)

Around this time the mysterious Park Yeong-Man also joins. You can see his name written on the white board in the picture belong along with other Bangtan trainees. The image comes from an old reality music competition on MBC called Star Audition: The Great Birth that Bang PD was one of the judges on. Choi Ikjes name is cut off from the top, but for this particular month the rankings were: 1. Ikje 2. Namjoon 3. Supreme Boi 4. Yoongi and unranked: Hoseok, Yeong-Man.

&amp;#x200B;

[Screenshot from MBC's \\""Star Audition: The Great Birth\\"" The white board on the far right shows Bangtan members' names.](https://i.redd.it/dx0ljh7m0wu21.png)

 

In Hoseoks 2 Cool 4 Skool thanks to section, he divides his acknowledgements into 2 groups: former Bangtan trainees, and former Bangtan members. He included Yeong-Man on the list of members rather than trainees, so whoever this guy was, he was considered to actually be in the group even though he never featured on anything. (The other people Hoseok included on his list of former members were Ikje and Iron. Supreme Boi wasnt listed here as he was thanked elsewhere in Hoseoks page). Namjoon also mentions Yeong-Man along with Iron, Ikje, and Jihoon (more on him in part 2) as Big Hit Fam. I have no other info about this guy except that he was older than 94line (Yoongi and Jin don't mention him so I can't get any more specific on dates).

In February 2011, Bangtan features on two more songs: Lee Hyuns [Bad Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWtK4wYX5ZM) and Kan Mi Youns [Because Im a Foolish Woman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUqKk3spn2c) Because Im a Foolish Woman is still available to listen to on Spotify and features Namjoon, Iron, and Supreme Boi. Bad Girl is credited as featuring BTS and GLAM (a girl group co-managed by Big Hit) despite the fact that only the leaders of each group actually appeared on the song (Jiyeon of GLAM and Namjoon).

Shortly after these songs came out something major must have gone on behind the scenes. Bangtan had always been advertised as debuting sometime in 2011, but for some reason those plans were scrapped indefinitely and instead the second hit it auditions began and the line up was redone.

Not shown in image, but I also have Namjoon and Taehyung postcards that are slightly defected (faint markings and slightly bent, respectively) that I'd also be interested in selling for $8 each including tracking so feel free to message me if interested!

That being said, within the last year or so, my participation in the fandom has increased as has my consumption of content, and I've realized I've picked up a few habits from the boys.

Most notably, my laugh has started sounding more like Jin's which leaves me very shook at times because I'm now wondering whether or not other people have noticed my laugh changing. Another thing is that little head tilt which Jungkook does when he's confused about something or thinking hard - I've started doing that in the middle of midterms and problem sets and then catch myself and am even more shook.

I also really love dancing (I try to take the time to learn at least one dance per semester), and I realized I've been channeling Hobi a lot more recently after being completely bias-wrecked by him during the LY Tour.

But after receiving the second one I started second guessing myself because there were some slight differences. 

So the first lightstick had a symbol on the [box](https://imgur.com/lUenz7O) and on the [lightstick](https://imgur.com/YBvmv01). The lightstick itself also has a code next to the symbol that says CCAL18LP2140T1 which apparently is a FCC ID. The first stick also has [beads](https://imgur.com/l3xlRwZ) but they don't clump together after shaking they kind of seem to stay apart from each other. The silver part on the bottom of the stick is also pretty tight or secure but it does spin around the base a bit. The [button](https://imgur.com/N27ReAc) has ridges but the circular part in the middle of the button is flat.

The second lightstick does not have the symbol on the [box](https://imgur.com/nnYc54u) or the [stick](https://imgur.com/tRNwpGN). It also doesn't have the FCC code. The [beads](https://imgur.com/caJsf2E) in this one seem to all clump up. I've read that this was a way to legit check the old ver 2 bombs because they weren't supposed to clump, but I don't know how true that is or if it's still relevant for the ver 3. The silver part of the base is much looser than the first one and can spin freely. The [button](https://imgur.com/BVlpSn7) also has ridges but the circular center has an indent rather than it being flat.
Some additional info would be that the base for the two sticks do not fit perfectly if you try to switch them, which makes me think that the threads on them are different. A really interesting note is that the both sticks connect to the BTS app and can both change color from the app.

I've also included an imgur [album](https://imgur.com/a/0tIdk7X) comparing the two as well for easier viewing and comparison.",10,22,False,self,,,,,

He wore a pink, silk shirt when he said it.

However, during a concert Jin said ""originally he was quiet and shy"", and during an old log he said that he was ""always cowering and lacked self-confidence"". His old logs in general are actually very sad, for example during one of the logs he wondered if he ""deserved receiving love"" on his birthday. 

So, I'm confused, if BigHit always restricted Jin's personality with a concept, was he always secretly loud and goofy? But what about how he acted in all those old videos? What about what he said about being ""quiet and shy""? I think maybe the concept was based on Jin's personality, but that gradually, Jin did become more confident in himself, and then when he had changed enough, he wanted to drop the concept. And BigHit finally let him around 2016. I doubt that his personality in the old videos is completely disingenuous, and just based on a concept.

What do you think? What is Jin's personality?",38,56,False,self,,,,,

  I thought it could be their past hardships of insecure trainees (being from small company as well) / RM's thoughtfulness and leadership that explain this, but after reading baepsayed's post today I've come to think that maybe their natural personality -which the former trainee Jihoon admired a lot-could be another reason. 

As for me, it is really hard not to become at least a little bit prideful when i've achieved small success. and I find my attitude changed even though I don't want it. 
This is the reason i really wonder how they're dealing with it everyday.

Nothing too elaborate or costly just some things that could spice up the stage a little and not make it look like a typical music show performance to people like me whove seen them perform the song so many times.

The latest example of this is the recent Europe DVD thumbnail BH chose. Jungkook is crying, and in the trailer we see Taehyung crying as well. There is a lot of talk about it on twitter, some fans saying that Big Hit is purposefully exploiting the members' vulnerable moments for money, some say that they respect BH and BTS for being so honest with their hardships, and some think the thumbnail was simply just in poor taste but likely not meant as intentionally harmful (I'm in this camp).

This makes me wonder how these different camps of fans view BTS and their relationship with the company. Some fans seem to think very poorly of Big Hit and believe the company treats BTS like slaves for how hectic their schedules are with all the touring and promotions. These fans also seem to think that BTS has no voice in their activities nor in the content that is produced for the fans, and that BH is dictating every aspect of their lives. To me this comes off as patronizing and that these fans not only have zero trust in BH and in BTS as well. In a vlive RM asked the fans to trust them, and the members have talked about being in a good headspace these days, and enjoying the work they do. There have been several instances of BH clearly putting the members' best interests first, like Jimin sitting out the Graham Norton show due to health(?) reasons, and the extended break between Her and Tear. There certainly have also been instances of trial and error, but for the most part I think BTS is in a good relationship with BH. Not everything always goes well and the members have talked about things they're unhappy with, but is there a reason to believe that BH and BTS don't communicate with each other about these things? Has BH done something specific that has caused some fans dislike the company so much?

What is your take on this? How do you view the relationship between Big Hit and BTS? Do you trust the company to treat them fairly? Do you think BTS have a say in the content (Burn the Stage, Runs, Bon Voyage etc.) that is produced for the fans? I'd love to hear your thoughts!",89,72,False,self,,,,,
2110,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2019-4-30,2019,4,30,6,biv7dd,self.bangtan,Members' Age Technicalities + the Korean Honorifics System,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/biv7dd/members_age_technicalities_the_korean_honorifics/,chahakyeons,1556574335,"Hi ARMY,

I'm a learned, lower-intermediate level Korean speaker (I'm not native or ethnically Korean). While I have a grasp of the honorifics and age system in KR, there are some cultural nuances I am curious about. If there are some K-ARMY or people who understand a little more, I'd love to be educated.

**Determining Age:**

From what I understand, Korea, like many other Asian countries, celebrate the Lunar New Year. They also +1 in age, from what I observe.

In most countries that follow the Lunar New Year, they follow the **Lunar New Year Rule.** 

* **Lunar New Year Rule:** Everyone is 1 at birth. Your 'age' increases on the Lunar New Year of every year. Everyone increases in age on the same day. Your age has nothing to do with your birthday.

To make the math easy, say someone is born in **April 2000**. Then in international age today, that person is 19 years old. In China, you are 20. But, if you were born in **Jan 2000** before the Lunar New Year, you are technically grouped with the 1999-ers, so even though your international age is 19, your lunar new year-adjusted age in those countries would be 21. If you were born in **November 2000**, your international age is 18, because your birthday hasn't happened yet this year. But in China, you are 20, still, because you actually don't have a birthday - birthdays are western things. Everyone's birthday is actually the Lunar New Year. (See chart for examples.)

&amp;#x200B;

|Birthday|International Age today|Lunar NY Age today|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jan 2000 (LNY was Feb 5, 2000)|19|21|
|Apr 2000|19|20|
|Dec 2000|18|20|
|Jan 2001 (before Jan 24, 2001)|18|20|
|Feb 2001|18|19|

&amp;#x200B;

However, generally due to globalization, people everywhere now celebrate birthdays. So for example, let's take Jin. Jin turned 26 in international age in December 2018. However, in December 2018, everyone all over the world, including Koreans, wished Jin a happy **27th birthday.** But if you're using the technical rule, he would have been 27 for most of 2018 already, because the Lunar New Year that increased his age count to 27 occurred in Jan/Feb 2018.

**My questions then regarding age, are:**

* Does Korea follow the Lunar New Year Rule, or some kind of modified hybrid rule?
* To be 100% technical, isn't it incorrect to say that December 4th, 2018 was his 27th birthday in Korean age, if they follow the Lunar New Year rule?
* **So taking Jin**: is he 27 in Korean age right now, or is he 28 in Korean age right now because Lunar New Year 2019 has passed?
* Technicalities aside, are the majority of young Koreans well-aware of how the technical lunar new year works? (Or do they kind of just do a general thing and +1 for everyone and maybe +2 for people born in January because the rule is too tedious?) (**Note:** I am not implying that I know their culture better than them. I am Asian myself, which is why I know of the Lunar New Year rule. However, my sister, cousins, and most of my friends who share the same ethnicity did not know this was how it worked. They kind of just would randomly +1 or +2, if they were born in January. This is why I ask.)

**Hyung/Oppa/Unni/Noona/Dongsaeng Relationships**

However, I know that KR that while there's some influence of this system in play for **age,** the honorifics title system doesn't 100% align with the age system. There's an element of **school grade** as well. My understanding is that kids that were born earlier in the year could have started school a bit early, (another reason other than the Lunar New Year dates for the Jan-Feb kids getting lumped with the prior year's kids). That's why BTS jokes around whenever they're in school uniform or roleplaying in a classroom environment and skip the honorifics with each other to be cheeky.

My question then is:

* **Which determines the title honorific relationship: age, or school year? Or is it both? Or is it one or the other depending on the context in which you met the person?**  (e.g. we can be *chingu* if you're a little older but we're in the same class for whatever reason and I don't have to call you *unni*, but if I met you outside on the street, I'd have to call you *unni)*

**How This (Somewhat Confusing) Arbitrary Age System which Dictates Honorific Culture is Perceived + Dictates Relationships**

Technically, Jin and Yoongi were only born **3 months apart**. (Jin is Dec 1992, Yoongi is Mar 9, 1993). But Jin is grouped with 92-liners, and Yoongi with 93-line. Yoongi calls Jin *hyung* and uses honorifics. JB from GOT7 (born Jan 1994) has mentioned that Yoongi is his *chingu.* JB gets grouped with the 93-line because he was born in Jan (though I'm not sure if it's because it's dictated by his Korean age or by his Korean school-grade). But then the age difference between Yoongi and JB is **10 months.** JB makes Jackson (GOT7) call him *hyung,* even though Jackson was born in March 1994 (3.5 month age difference; and though he concedes to be respectful of Korean culture, Jackson has mentioned that this annoys him, as a foreigner). Hobi was born in Feb 1994 and Namjoon is Sept 1994, a **7 month age** difference. But they're *chingu*. 

So I've pointed out some examples of small month difference that have a *hyung-dongsaeng* relationship, as well as larger month differences that classify under *chingu*.

* **How does the average young Korean feel about these rules determining who they have to speak respectfully to? Does it annoy the average Korean in Yoongi's shoes, who's only 3 months younger than someone to have to call them** ***hyung*** **and use honorifics?**

Thank you in advance, would love to learn more!",50,54,False,self,,,,,

Before stumbling upon BTS, I was very narrow-minded about kpop and about Asian popular culture in general despite being Asian American. I always related more to my American side and I guess you could call me white-washed but I had very little interest in the kpop community because I had a negative connotation of it in my mind and about kpop fans. It wasnt until my sister actually straight up confronted me about it and asked me why I was so narrow-minded about it and basing the whole community on a negative stereotype I held in my head. 

When I visited Korea and I heard Spring Day, I was surprised that it was BTS because I had an image in my mind that they were your average mainstream pop group whose music catered to the masses. I had no intent on looking more into their music or who they were as a group but my sister coincidentally was getting into BTS at the same time and kept sending me videos (much to my annoyance) but after I watched some videos out of boredom, I quickly fell down the rabbit hole and now I look back and think about my previous attitudes about this community and was wondering if any of you guys experienced the same thing?",95,53,False,self,,,,,
