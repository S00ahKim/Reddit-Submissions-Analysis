Help please?,NancyTheGrimm,1527816099,"So a few weeks back I got an email from AXS (I bought my ticket from them) and it was about helping choose the set list for the show I have a ticket for. It gave me a list of songs to choose from, nearly all the way back to HYYH pt1.

I'm confused because I've talked to a few of my friends who are also going (a few going to different shows) but none of them have gotten an email like it.  Has anyone here gotten an email like this from their shows official ticket seller?
Or was this a haux email?

28,2018-6-1,2018,6,1,17,8nq851,Love Yourself Tour Buy/Sell/Trade Megathread (EU),llaverna,1527840607,"Since the [earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8h8t7e/love_yourself_tour_buyselltrade_megathread/) is already pretty full with US ticketing, here's a designated spot for all your buying/selling/trading needs regarding the Love Yourself world tour **in Europe**. Good luck!

From the previous thread, words of advice from /u/1314janira:

&gt;I know that now that tickets are out everyone wants to get their hands on them immediately, but please wait before buying your tickets from a third party.

&gt;First of all, just keep refreshing all official sellers every once in a while, because there are still chances (although, admitedly, very slim) that some will pop up throughout the day.

&gt;But most importantly: anyone trying to resell their tickets now bought them specifically to make money off people, you won't find reasonable prices. It's not like you'll buy them off fans who unfortunately can't go anymore if they've been on sale for an hour, if you see someone selling tickets already there's a 100% chance they're scalpers. And the worst part is: if you buy it from a scalper, you're also risking wasting your money because of the chances of either getting scammed and being given a fake ticker, or of the tickets beign genuine but being cancelled because recognised as resold.

&gt;Wait at least a few weeks, the closest to the date of the concert, the higher the chances of someone actually selling their tickets because they can't go anymore, and buying from a fan means higher chances of getting a decent price.

And /u/torywestside:

&gt;If you are trying to resell or trade tickets and you want to post about it on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Amino, etc., watermark your photos!!!!!! Put your name on it, put your username on it, put SOMETHING all over the picture to identify it as yours. Scalpers are bad but this is also prime time for scammers and they will steal your pictures and use them to scam others if you dont watermark them.",458,70

71,2018-6-2,2018,6,2,4,8nuqg9,[Insane Theory] The weird link between BTS and Linkin Park,CODEeon,1527881379,"I want to start by saying that I got into BTS after randomly seeing a clip of them jamming to Linkin Park. 

&amp;nbsp;

After listening to the extended version of Fake Love, I legitimately got chills from the first guitar chords. They instantly reminded of Linkin Park's work, specifically their early work. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now where does my theory stand? I remember the US media posts about BTS. Most of them were describing the song/aesthetics as being close to the ""emo"" concept. A genre that died long ago and was mainly carried by nu-metal bands, such as Linkin Park. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now if you listen carefully to the extended version, you'll see a pattern. A slow guitar build-up accompanied by a piano , heading towards a heavy drop that shakes the whole song. Not only that, but the way the song is phased is text-based Linkin Park. Mike Shinoda (the rapper of the group) singing the middle parts of the song with Chester Bennington (vocalist) starting the bridge and continuing with the chorus. The same happens with RM/Suga/J-Hope and V/JK/Jimin/Jin.

&amp;nbsp;

Now before we get into the sad part of the theory I want to remind you all that this is just my take on the whole situation.


&amp;nbsp;

Linkin Park is known to have a huge influence (within the music industry) in charity. They created a non profit organisation, ""Music for Relief"". But prior to that, their lyrics were theorized to have a subliminal message that was meant to expose the way string were pulled in the music industry. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now getting back to BTS. In the M/V we see them literally dying inside and projecting themselves in the mirror. I truly believe that this has nothing to do with a romantic love, but a self love for the art of music itself. The ""Fake Love"" they have been describing is actually their fake love for the current/future projects. 

&amp;nbsp;

With BTS, sadly, becoming mainstream, they're forced into creating songs that would appeal to the whole world. With the new album, we see influences from the Latino genre to Alternative/Techo. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now the ending of the M/V. Well, we have JK, the youngest of them, simply getting converted. He finally decides to join the ""cult"" which stand for whatever the mainstream decides. They soullessly look towards the camera, motionless, somewhat apologizing, only to be crushed by the burden of their thoughts. 

&amp;nbsp;

Linkin Park was(/is?) a group that went all across the whole musical spectrum. But they warned us of something, which was how the music industry likes to manipulate their ""puppets""(artists) , regardless of the costs. BTS is slowly getting sold into the mainstream, getting a VEVO partnership and God knows what next.

I discovered BTS around two weeks ago when they performed in BBMA 2018. I was reading articles in flipboard when I saw news about how a kpop group rocked BBMA and I clicked it... I should not have.

After clicking the article, I Googled their Fake Love MV and then the reactions to it...

Soon after I looked for their music in Spotify and Googled the MVs of their songs that I like and watched all reactions to those MVs.

Then I started watching clips of their variety shows on YouTube and developed bias from one member to the next. #jungshook

I stopped watching Anime, Netflix, playing my PS4 and even stopped listening to other kinds of music altogether. I even stopped watching movies! I find myself literally obsessed with everything BTS.

I am afraid I've become a part of ARMY and BTS is slowly taking over my life. I haven't even let any of my friends know that I'm becoming obsessed with this... Thing.

I try to avoid searching them in YouTube Spotify or Google. I tried even watching and listening to other kpop groups but no! Nothing can compare.

All this in a span of TWO WEEKS just two weeks ago when I clicked that damned flipboard article about their performance in BBMA.

I need help. Is anyone else like this? Is this an actual mental disorder? I don't want BTS to take over my life, how to move on?",7,7

RM : Problematic Man
Jin : Law of Jungle
J-Hope : Star King (I couldn't find one where he did only himself)
Jimin : King of Masked Singer
V : Celeb Bros
Jungkook : Celeb Bros and Flower Boy

134,2018-6-3,2018,6,3,12,8o5rzh,Poem sent to RM as fanmail,aye_zt,1527995111,"Hi everyone, 

This is a [poem] (https://imgur.com/a/BAQ6rta) I wrote and mailed to RM recently. I hope it reaches him and he likes reading it. I also wanted to share this poem with other ARMYs, in case it resonates with some of you. I'm quite nervous sharing this as I do not know what kind of reaction to expect. But just to give everyone some background info about what this is about. 

I'm a quiet poet who sometimes thinks about things too deeply and then I need to write down my thoughts or I won't be able to carry on with my life normally, haha. So this poem is one of those outbursts that is lightly inspired by a few of BTS' songs. I would like to thank three very lovely and generous ARMYs who I met on this sub; u/myystikspiral, u/wishawisha and u/diminie. They went beyond the required effort to translate and proofread this poem in Korean, so I could send it to RM. I don't think they needed to put in so much effort for me, I don't deserve it, but they still did it and I'm eternally grateful to see one of my poems transform into another language because of their dedication. I'm sorry if this was a difficult process for you three but thank you so much for your help! This collaboration has warmed my heart and made me fall in love even more with the generous side of the fandom. If it wasn't for this sub, this poetry project would never have come into fruition, as I wouldn't have found such amazing translators here, so thank you r/bangtan as well. 

My sincere message to all ARMYs is that yes, life can be difficult at times, but I pray we can find meaning behind those difficulties and transform them into something that carries elements of beauty, as I believe that makes living easier. Please enjoy reading this poem and I hope you have a good day wherever you are my dear fellow ARMYs. 

P.S. I [posted this on twitter] (https://twitter.com/a_bleu_contrail/status/1003107833393528833) as well, in case @bts_twt reads it, but I have really low expectations of that happening since they probably get tagged a lot.

Any input or opinion is welcome. 

Jin: \[The Caregiver \] His focus in this world is to take care of people and meaningful things. He tries to protect a flower, which can represent either him or people he cares about. He closes the shades thinking he can hide away from problems and pain, he doesn't face them, and keeps the illusion of something beautiful but then the windows explode to express he was too vulnerable and couldn't handle reality or protect people. 

Namjoon: \[The regular guy\] He is the common man, he tries to stay positive, he wants to be a better person for someone else but not himself. He wants to go out of his way for others and forgets himself, ""I don't know me"". His reflection is what he isn't paying attention. He sacrificed all for a ingenuine and undeserving love.

Yoongi: \[The Creator\] He is the the melodramatic side of grief, using music as a device to overcome it but he still can't move on and he keeps feeling pain, with fire on the background exposing how vivid and overwhelming the feelings and also his explosive personality. He wants to express himself, even if there is no audience. He wants to use fake love as an inspiration to create musical things.

Jungkook: \[The exporer\] He is watching everything. He wants to do new things, wants to face new challenges like escaping collapsing floor or using a key to open a door he doesn't know where it's leading to. He will take risks that would mean 

Hoseok: \[The innocent\] Eating sweets and chocolate can be cathartic, but there is so much it can do when there is grief. He lived in fantasy land while it worked. Hobi relied too much in it, he didn't see the bad and he reached a point where all his problems and feelings took over. He lost himself in all the feelings and overwhelmingness. 

Taehyung: \[The Lover\] He feels deeply. He loved deeply and can't let go. He can only check his phone to maybe get some hope that things will change and he will get back together with his ex but the phone turns into sand because there is no hope, there is no future. He wants to love and be loved but it was a fantasy, it was fake. 

Jimin: \[The Magician\] He focuses on art, as he is in a room that seems like a dancing place. He will work hard to convice both himself and other people that everything is okay with his artistic skills. He will create a new reality to shelter himself from all the bad. ",2,62

I was a child back then though, so I think that has a lot to do with it, but not quite. BTS just has that something SPECIAL. I think we can all agree on this. :) I must also add that I have never followed any other type of artist or celeb to this degree either.

I have a question for you !

I am not a fan of BTS, but I have been reading a lot about the band for the last two days. The reason is that on Friday, the tickets for their Paris concerts went on sale. Since my cousin is a HUGE BTS fan, I spent two hours online trying to book her a ticket and I succeeded! I was very happy at first, but now I realize that I was very lucky. On Twitter, hundreds of fans are saying that they didn't manage to get a single ticket (seriously, hundreds!). Meanwhile, on websites like StubHub, some people are selling tickets for 10 times the original price!!! Does that always happen? Does it also happen in Korea or only in Europe?

How can I help? It breaks my heart to see all those fans, especially some of the younger ones who are completely heartbroken. Is there anything that can be done against scalpers?

I must sound very naive ^^ I know this happens at a lot of big concerts. I've been to see Lady Gaga and Beyonce and the same kind of thing happened but I've never seen it happen on such a huge scale.",7,4

Since the Pitchfork review stated that ""Tear isnt as ambitious or stunning or tragic as Wings,"" I assumed that if Pitchfork would do a review for WINGS, it might get a higher score than Tear (if I'm delulu I'll say 8/10). And also just the whole visuals for the individual short films and for Blood Sweat and Tears is very creative and uncommon in the US market (correct me if I'm wrong) will likely attract the general public.

Can WINGS be a on par or do even better than 'Tear' when it comes to critics, sales and streams?

&gt;With the [growing popularity of groups such as BTS](https://blog.chartmetric.io/k-pop-2-0-how-bts-becomes-americas-hottest-boy-band-c548671d1a67), it would seem, at least on the surface, that Kpop is the long awaited answer in fighting [western emasculation and erasure of Asian men in the media](https://nextshark.com/dark-history-behind-medias-portrayal-asian-men/).  However, there also exists an ongoing debate as to just how much Kpops  boy bands actually help in battling western emasculation or on the  contrary, how much they may even *reinforce*  negative stereotypes of Asian men. While it cant be denied that Kpops  catchy tunes have been able to captivate many worldwide, the question  as to whether the presentation of many of the boy bands in terms of  dress and style does [more harm to Asian mens image](http://ricemedia.co/are-korean-pretty-boys-killing-asian-masculinity/) remains.

Another quote from blog

&gt; Why do the women promoting alternative masculinity for Asian men happen to be Asian women? Why do these same Asian women  
&gt;  
&gt;1. **avoid Asian men**  
2. **only tell Asian men** to embrace alternative masculinity  
3. have only non\-Asian partners \(who often also hate Asian men\)  
4. **only pursue men with traditional masculinity**  
5. [have a fetish for and/or are influenced by yaoi](https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL55_0607.pdf)  
6. or, identify as asexual or a lesbian?

uh...  I'm lost by this point

""Flower boy"" was pushed by the U.S. government?

&gt;The takeaway  here is that Kitagawa was a Japanese\-American who had worked for the  United States government. Yoshiki also noted that in fact, **it was America**  that gave birth to the Johnnies, because Kitagawas first contact with  young Japanese boys was at a site owned and operated by the United  States government; Washington Heights.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not  only is this fact essential to proving that the birth of the flower  boy was not something that naturally came from Asian culture, but that  there could potentially be something or someone insidious, perhaps even  sinister, who was behind the popularization of the flower boy in Asian  media. This is especially the case when taking into account the fact  that the United States government was involved. As a result, the  question *isnt* whether the U.S. government played a role in pushing the emasculating style onto young Asian men. Rather, the question that *should*  be asked is how big of a role did it play in pushing the style and how  big of a role did it play in potentially brainwashing many young Asian  men and women to embrace the style as attractive?

248,2018-6-5,2018,6,5,11,8on3vh,'Magic shop' exercise origin,embersue,1528164530,"Hi all. I wasn't sure if this warranted its own post or not, but I'm still seeing a lot of misinformation (on a popular kpop site) about the origin of this exercise so I wanted to share.

The magic shop exercise was created by J. L. Moreno some time in the 1930's. It was first published in 1948 in Psychodrama Vol. I. Moreno is considered the creator of psychodrama. There are a lot of books by him, but this is [one that covers his entire work.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUAN5BC)

The magic shop guided fantasy is most popularly utilized during group therapy sessions. The therapist/facillitator of the group will ask everyone to imagine that they have just entered a magic shop and have the ability to exchange a quality that they do not like about themselves for something else that is desired. Money cannot be exchanged, only internal personality traits or qualities. For example, fear can be exchanged for love.  So in Fake Love trailer 1 the guys exchange tangible objects, but they are representative of fear. Once the bargain is made, there is generally a discussion about the new quality and how it feels to be without the old one. What is purchased is not always what is expected, either. The guys trade in their fear for love, but it's a fake love a la DNA.

The exercise helps with clarifying goals and is used in a variety of therapeutic contexts so it's possible that someone in BH or their extended creative team has participated in the exercise at some point and that is where the inspiration comes from. 

[Magic Shop: Healing with the Imagination by Helen Graham](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0877287708) explains the exercise more in depth and a variety of other meditation/healing exercises as well. [Here's an excerpt](http://imgur.com/Mc7wbpg).

http://theory-tales.tumblr.com/post/174060346997/fake-love-theory

*Theory Tales* poses that the boys are manifestations of one person at each stage of life and that in the MV, Jungkook is going through each persona until he reaches the end where he unlocks that room with the mask. 

[Her post](http://theory-tales.tumblr.com/post/172945263172/a-holistic-theory-and-explanation-of-hyyh-%E8%8A%B1%E6%A8%A3%E5%B9%B4%E8%8F%AF) on the bigger picture of Bangtan's message tying together multiple eras is also great (written in Apr). She connects the 'Jungian Theory of Personality' well, which I found particularly intriguing. It is well researched!

250,2018-6-5,2018,6,5,11,8onbtx,"A Poem Inspired by ""The Truth Untold""",Wordbender16,1528166613,"From the album, ""The Truth Untold"" was the track that resonated with me the most on a deeply personal level, even more so when I learned about the story it took inspiration from (La Citt di Smeraldo, which, to summarize - please note though that I haven't actually read the story, so some points may be inaccurate - is about ""a man who hides in his house (or sandcastle) because hes afraid of showing himself due to his ""hideous"" physical appearance. As he watches from the window, he falls in love with a woman stealing flowers from his garden to sell them for a living. Trying to help her, he grows a special flower (smeraldo) so that she can earn a lot more money from it, but before he could muster the courage to come out of hiding and give it to her, the woman dies, not being able to see it."") - although this is just a fan theory, but it is very likely to be true that the song is based on that story. As a self-conscious, painfully insecure person, I've always naturally shied away from people and any social event thanks to my fear of being judged by others, especially for my physical appearance. But I can also relate to the song in its figurative sense - as in, feeling ""ugly"" not just in the superficial sense, but feeling that way because of your weaknesses and the dark, ugly side of your personality that you don't want others to see  the inability and reluctance to show or give your true self to anyone out of fear of becoming a burden to them or eventually driving them away, and the necessity of wearing a mask or creating an ideal facade in front of others to prevent that from happening, etc. Those insecurities, fear and shyness have caused me to miss so many opportunities to try new things and to make new friends. And going back to the story of Smeraldo, I can also somehow relate to the man's regret of failing to reveal himself sooner to give the girl the flower which could have possibly saved her life. I, too, have felt the desire to help someone who is going through a similar loneliness or just a difficult time in general, but my low self-esteem has always held me back from removing my mask and approaching them first, consequently failing to help that person and to initiate what could've been a good, meaningful relationship with them. The struggle of longing and craving for a meaningful friendship but completely lacking the courage and self-confidence to put yourself out there and make friends is something that I can relate to very deeply.

Anyways, thats enough rambling, sorry for the long intro  but here is the poem. It's not perfect and may be lacking in some ways, but I haven't been writing poetry for that long, so I'm not that good. Please tell me what you guys think, and some constructive criticism would also be much appreciated! I hope I was able to translate the vulnerability and raw emotion of the song into my own poem and to convey the meaning of the original lyrics through these words.


Bound to a secluded castle of sand,
 
Engulfed by my shadow of loathing and shame,

Nothing but a ghost in mans land,

This injured beast that cannot be tamed.

Sprouted in the overgrown garden full of thorns, 

Like weed that thrives in vain  a stray without a name.

All the yellow roses that have been heartlessly torn,

Have been replaced with wolfsbane,

And poppies to tranquilize the beast in pain.


Yetwhen you stole into my garden, 

My desolate, ice-cold heart burst into flames    

Perhaps a mixture of fear and ecstasy

At a curious visitors unwonted company. 

Always from my closed, curtained window,

I watched you come, I watched you go

Under the moon, and under the sun

Each time my response was to run.

Through the glass I could see you,

but in my tur...bid, bro...ken re...flec...tion

My grotesque face overlapped 

your kindly, glowing countenance,

An expression that contorted into 

a familiar one of revulsion.


While you marvelled at and picked the beautiful flowers,

I wasted that chance on simply gazing with gnawing hunger.

So close yet infinitely distant - a distance to stay safe.

How could I ever show you my real face?

Every time you wandered closer to my window,

Back into my mould-stained corner I would cower.	


The only thing I could ever do, before the end was due,

was to grow for you a special blue flower,

That flourished like my longing for your warmth,

Yet still not an ounce of courage to leave my tower.

In the wake of your departure, my flower has withered,

Standing alone in the relentless rain, I wept and shivered

Following its last faded petals, 

at last my foolish mask falls and shatters, revealing

The sincerity that could not be delivered.",22,57

(sorry post malone but Anpanman and Paradise are BOPS)

But when my friends who don't listen to kpop and don't like it see this they get annoying. You see the thing is the background I grew up in and my friends are the type of music that's completely opposite from kpop and bts.

Ever heard of London Grime? You probably haven't if you're not from London or the UK. Long story short the demographic I come while not directly saying it - it's basically expected only females would listen to these makeup transexual people sing. My apologies if that offends anyone. It's stupid but it's genuinely what people in this type of demographic think, at least the majority.

Now my friends are amazing and there's lot's of banter and for the most part I've learnt to not give a shit when it comes to being different.

To this day i still find it funny how someone like me is stuck to bts and kpop but hey that's what's awesome!

Anyways I feel like I need more kpop bts friends cos it's very tough to fanboy and not annoy others (which on things like twitter they kinda have a good reason if their TL is filled with stuff they don't like)

I mean, am I like the only one in this situation? I've actually made efforts to find friends who I've never met through reddit, It's worked nicely and I've found two great people. Amino is cool but it's not the same, it feels very spammy and all over the place.

Also curious if there is a survey that can be done for this, It'd be cool to know how diverse our community is here - maybe ask questions for country, town, gender, age? ",39,32

I will never think any group is overrated or overhyped. It just means there is something their fans see in them that I cannot realize because their music might not click with me. To me, it just means a lot of people are looking forward to it and get too excited. However when it doesn't meet their preferences, they will think it is mediocre. This is what I notice a lot that spoils the experience for people that are trying to get into bts. I think it is better not to have any expectations at all because they can not always give you the kind of music you like.",19,42

Aside for this content, what do you guys anticipate for Bighit put out another content for BTS? My sister suggested that Bighit should produce a film for BTS.

Another would be documentary/concert film maybe Justin Bieber Never Say Never, but we already got Burn The Stage.

I also really like it if Bighit release a books based on each era/series that explain their storyline and concept. I am pretty sure Army gonna like it and buy it.

I ordered Wings from there and I received them fairly quickly even with the issues I had placing the order. I preordered LY:Tear within the first 20 minutes or so of preorders going up. I have posted on the Q&amp;A board and my order has been awaiting shipment for nearly TWO WEEKS. I havent received a response from either post I have posted on the board either. 

Has anyone else had issues like this?",11,27

I will be going to study as an exchange student for a year in Japan in September, and I was thinking about joining the official Japanese fanclub, as it lasts for a year. However, I have been tryng to find information about the ""requirements"" or how it works but it seems like there almost no information about this in English.

Is anybody part of the Japanese fanclub here? I know that in the case of the Korean official fanclub, you have to wait until a certain moment in order to join, but I have read that in the case of the Japanese fanclub you can join whenever you want. I have also read that you need to have a residence in Japan in order to join as well, and I'm quite worried as I will be staying at the dormitories that the university provides. I have quite a lot of doubts but I can't seem to find any anwers anywhere. 

I apologise for any mistakes, as English is not my first language!",9,31

I got too excited when the BT22 cushions went back in stock on Amazon and I got all the characters in both sizes (except for Koya and Van, I only got the large ones).

&amp;nbsp;
They're super adorable and I'd keep them if I could but they take up too much space! I'm hoping they can find a new home! They're brand new and each of them comes with a cute dusr bag. I'll be shipping them out in the original shipment box from LINE Friends. 

&amp;nbsp;
Thinking of selling the small ones for $40 and large for $50. Price includes shipping :)

TL:DW: If kpop/korean music wants to become a thing internationally more groups need to go big in the US just as BTS has.  



But when will that happen, and from what label will it be from? The next Bighit group? Or does the group already exist? And will one group be enough, or will need more than one group being relevant at a time?

444,2018-6-8,2018,6,8,22,8pjs9z,2019 and beyond...predictions for BTS and Big Hit,SongMinho,1528463715,"My predictions:

Will continue touring in the 1st half of 2019. Will include South America, Asia, Australia, Nw Zealand.

Will also drop the final installment of Love Yourself series.

After the Love Yourself Tour ends, BTS should pursue individual activities. Solo albums, mixtapes, acting, variety, etc...

I can see Namjoon expanding further into the US and Western markets as a solo act.

Big Hit will start introducing us to their new group and potentially debut them at the end of 2019.

My bias wreckers are ( the rest of bangtan) mostly Jungkook &amp; Yoongi. 

Yoongi because he's a big mood most of the time, he's adorable af when he does aegyo, &amp; he's also very inspirational to me from his past. If he can make it then I can too, y'know?
 Love him. 

Jungkook because he's an adorable little bunny &amp; a huge meme. He works hard everyda,y- they all do- he loves his hyungs even though he teased them all the time, lmao. 
Love him too.

* A series similar to ""Impractical Pranksters"" where they do things like:    
dropping a member in a grocery store and telling him what to do through an earpiece. Those who refuse gets punished. That would be sooooo hilarious lol   
* A mini series showing the creation of a song from start to finish   
* Another series like AHL where they are constantly given group tasks and obstacles in a different setting (not in Korea)
* Fulfilling Jungkook's dream of sky diving in a Run BTS! episode

What are you early predictions or wishes for the coming era (music-wise, theme-wise, look-wise, etc.)?

Here are some of mine:

&gt; Jin gets to sing the intro for this one. Possibly a ballad, because his voice fits that genre the best. Imho, they really did a good job playing to the strength of each member of the vocal line for their respective intros (Im counting Euphoria for JK heh). Looking forward to Jin showing off his vocal chops in his!

&gt; For the title track, I want a song a la Spring Day. I think a slower song really fits thematically, since were already in the Resolution part of the story.

&gt; Since they just released a full-length album, I think LY:A will be a short one. Im thinking around 6-7 songs?

&gt; Look-wise, I think theyre gonna go for a simple and youthful aesthetic. Simple make-up, no smoky eyes (forgive me Im not knowledgeable on this one, Im a fanboy lol). I think theyre gonna dye their hair different colors again.",58,56

541,2018-6-10,2018,6,10,19,8q029e,"Meaning of ""Dope"" with regard to ""Paradise""",kavyaxxvii,1528627850," I need some help interpreting the lyrics of ""Dope.""

So when I first read the translations, I felt that the song is about working hard and how you have to make many sacrifices to achieve success. The song talks about perseverance and never giving up on your dreams, no matter what it takes. 

Then after Paradise, I listened to Dope again today and the meaning has completely changed, atleast for me. Now I feel as if Dope *too* is talking about how in the pursuit of success, we must not forget the important things in life (family, friends etc) and how we must stop running and not become slaves. 

I don't know now and I'm really confused. Are these songs giving two very different messages or is ""Dope"" just a sarcastic version of ""Paradise""? Thoughts?",0,1

It is quickly becoming my favorite.  I love the mostly mellow vibe.  Although the album tackles the darker side of love, there is definitely a hopeful tone to the overall album.  So many positive messages to help pull people out of the depths.  Love the overall theme of this album.

Favorite 3 songs in order:
1) So What 2) Love Maze 3) Fake Love

I love the club/dance vibe of so what.  Also love the message of the song.  Love Maze is a mesmerizing slow burner.  Definitely a great chill song.  Fake Love has really grown on me.  Liked it at first but love it now.

Just so you know, Im Korean myself and same goes for my friend.

Lets just call my friend Sophie. 
Sophie and I are long time besties and lately weve been obsessed with bts. Im namjoon and hoseok biased and shes maknae line biased, which is fine but what I cant stand of her is that she only praises maknae line and never says something bout the hyung line.
Whenever she talks about hyung line is a meme, she never appreciates their talent, visuals, personalities etc.

One time I was listening to dope and the part came where joon goes hm? Its your first time with bangtan, right? and i was shooketh to the core but Sophie was like ewww so cheesy lol so I went what? eww? Are u srs? If this was V, would you still consider it cheesy? And she went well.. thats different you know 
Jesus christ..

I also told her once to listen to reflection and MAMA, and she did but she said haha listen to 0.23 in paradise kookies voice is so good (which I do agree on) but she didnt even bother to give her thoughts on the masterpieces. 

Sometimes we will go on snapchat and send snaps of ourselves reacting to bts performances, and she will ALWAYS ONLY send pictures of maknae line and never talk about hyung line. Oh yeah she once called me a fake fan just bc i forgot to point out where V was in a picture. 

She also keeps calling joon an egg? Like yea it was funny that one time but liek namjoon shouldnt be defines by an egg. 

So yeah that was my rant and can somebody tell me how to say to her that shes a lowkey fake fan and isnt actually army. Thanks

They managed to get 20k~ capacity venues in North America and Europe so we can only imagine what's in store for Asia.


I'm expecting a full on dome tour in Japan with a few arenas in there and maybe some of the biggest venues in countries like Phillipines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. For the Wings tour they heavily underestimated their popularity in Brazil so hopefully they book a much bigger venue this time.


Also, it'll be interesting to see if they'll perform in a country they've never visited before. I'm low-key hoping for a concert in India since I know they have quite a huge following there. Also, will they be able to book the Seoul Olympic Stadium for the encore or will it be at the Gocheok Sky Dome again?

BEFORE YOU GO HATING belIEVE ME the amount of tears i have shed over all of their beauty is enough to fix a drought. My friend (who had been stanning for over a year before she introduced me) had said that when i made comments about not finding namjoon attractive or thinking hoseok resembled a short haired korean girl, she said she had to let me ""go through the no jams phase"" that people experience at first. Looking back, i have NO IDEA how i thought hoseok looked like a girl. he does not at all. i remember feeling that way though. and namjoons face and wink and smile literally can make my mood do a 180 and go from shit to amazing because hes so mf adorable. 

i recently introduced one of my friends to bts, and she is making similar no jams comments, and as much as i want to go off on her, i remembered that used to be me. i really have no idea how my friend that introduced me to them was able to bite her tongue and turn the other cheek when i said dumb things. im the biggest ot7 stan and i will be celebrating my 1 year   anniversary being an ARMY in October, literally a week after i go see them in concert in Chicago!! i want to be clear that I DO NOT HAVE THESE NO JAMS THOUGHTS ANYMORE! and they were never aggressive, i NEVER thought namjoon was ugly or anything like that. the only thing that left my mouth was a calm ""i dont think hes very attractive"", this was literally within the first week of me knowing about BTS that i made such remarks. i cringe whenever i think about how i could have possibly felt that way. i am a chaaanged women lol.

I wanted to make a new thread for discussing the dinner party since the other one has already racked up nearly 300 comments without much discussion of the actual content (since the subs only recently came out). It makes it a bit difficult to have a proper discussion and there is so much to unpack. I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of interesting tidbits but here's some stuff to use as a launchpad:

**What is happiness?** \- I'm sure that's something that we've all thought about. Jin's philosopy \- that laughter equals happiness \- is something that I don't really identify with but I can definitely see it in the way that he behaves. I'd say I think more along the same lines as Hobi and Jimin.

**Afraid of the fall but not of landing** \- Suga had my full attention through most of this video and this part really stuck out to me. I know that it's not the first time he's said this but I feel like it was a running theme throughout the whole dinner. The guys know that at some point they're going to have to come down and that might be scary for them, like it would be for any of us. 

**Yoongi potentially writing a song for Jimin** \- Well that'd be great but I refuse to get my hopes up!

**RM and a musician he respects** \- It's interesting to hear where his focus on separating RM from Kim Namjoon comes from, especially since we've heard so much about it lately (BTStage and Airplane pt. 2)

**Song by V** \- I hope that it does end up getting released, it sounds like he worked hard on it. 

**Jungkook** \- I know that it's been spoken about before, but it really must be a strange experience to be growing up under the spotlight. I really think that he's done well so far.

There was a tonne of other stuff that I wanted to talk about but I've forgotten it. Didn't realise I'd need to take notes :D",89,199

https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VTBkuKak1m3xTt8EMiKIl88Ld3venODzI3uhdk2Ia4/mobilebasic

And ARMY was referred to as a brand unto themselves and that we were Pro-sumers and not merely consumers of BTS content. Meaning that we created a hefty amount of content ourselves.

And I was wondering, are we really the only fandom that does that these days? I mean, I casually follow and enjoy other KPop groups so I dont know how other fandoms behave.

The last group I was really into was Winner and I dont recall seeing this much activity within the fandom. And I will be honest, the long drought and lack of content is what caused me to drift towards BTS.

Example: 

My mom was listening to my Tear CD in the car and got really confused when Anpanman was playing because there was an electric-sounding ping in the instrumental.

I visited Taipei back in January and was looking for stores that sold BTS's older albums. After some googling, I somehow ended up on the FB page of a BTS-themed cafe instead. I was super intrigued because nothing like this exists where I live, so I dragged my boyfriend to go to the cafe with me. This is a super late post, but I wanted to share in case this might be useful information for anyone who will be visiting Taipei &amp; wants to check it out :)

Here are some pictures (and a video) that I took: https://imgur.com/gallery/IWYWVzc

I was worried that the place would be packed because I had read online that this place can get very busy and there are often lines to get into the cafe. Also, since I'm a little 'older' (I'm 24), I thought I might stick out like a sore thumb since the reviews also mentioned the customer base is generally teenagers. However, I went on a rainy day in the middle of January, so the cafe was actually quite empty. I think there were only 2 other people besides me. It was also REALLY hard to find because it's in the basement. You have to go downstairs and there isn't a huge sign above the door or anything. It's only a few minutes walk from the subway station, but we were walking back and forth and kept missing it! Finally, we saw the small cardboard sign pointing downstairs and we were able to find it. The place itself was full of BTS collectibles, memorabilia, posters, pictures, and the like, which are displayed all over the stores (on the walls or in the display cabinet). Off the top of my head, I remember seeing an autographed album, a BTS Lego set, a RM cardboard cut-out, and a lot of photo cards. They also play only BTS music videos (of course) on the TV. I ordered a coffee with Jungkook's face on it :) If you get this coffee, you can pick the member. There were other menu options as well, including food, but I did not order anything else. The coffee was okay, but I came for the unique BTS experience and not necessarily the food or coffee lol so I didn't care if I spent $5 for mediocre coffee, since it came with Jungkook's face haha. Also, after ordering, they let me choose 2 photo cards out of a box. Overall, I really enjoyed it because it was such a unique experience. If you're in Taipei and love BTS, definitely visit this place! I think it's also a cool place to meet other BTS fans, but I don't speak any Chinese, so my communication abilities were limited lol. Sorry for the long text post - if you have any other questions, feel free to ask me :)

She has requested that I find her some where the boys are genuinely having fun and laughing, and i'm hoping you guys will be able to help as i'm a fairly new Army myself. So far i have sent her the MyFM video where they sing and dance to Britney and Backstreet Boys, Knowing Brothers ep, an After School Club ep, and a couple of random music show interviews from a few years ago.

I think Hobi would be the most fun to go with. He's the dancing king and would encourage everyone to get out on floor and have a good time. I'd look forward to taking a cheesy [""seatbelt""] (https://i.imgur.com/SCBm74w.jpg) pose prom photo with facial expressions like this: [](#jh_fml)

I thought it would be fun to make and share a similar list of the 10 small things that makes us happy or brings us joy in our daily lives. 

Ill start:

1) Waking up early on the weekends just to lay in bed for a couple more hours.

2) Eating my favorite foods (sushi, tteokbokki, and sweets) while watching a movie.

3) Dancing in my living room like no ones watching (with the exception of my dog, who probably thinks Im a weirdo by now).

4) Cooking or baking for the people I love and care about.

5) Singing everywhere I go. I love going to karaoke bars as well.

6) Being surrounded by nature and feeling the wind in my hair. 

7) Making people laugh.

8) Going on adventures. I love to get lost.

9) Reading and analyzing different forms of art (literature, movies, paintings, etc.)

10) Last, but not least, BTS. These 7 boys have given me so much joy over the past few months. I cant imagine a day where Im not listening to their music, watching their interviews or performances, laughing at the chaotic activities they get to do on Run BTS!, and learning more about their personalities. Whenever Im sad, I honestly think about them and feel happy again. Theyre more than just some K\-Pop band. To me, they feel like childhood friends that I look forward to seeing every day.",5,3

Just like BTS... I think it would be a fun idea for all of us to share 10 things that make up our list of small happinesses. 

My list of Small Happinesses:
1. My bills for the month are paid off.. but I still got some extra casssssh (like $10 lol) left over 
2. Taking hundreds of photos and getting 1 decent one 
3. Ordering something online and having it arrive earlier than expected  
4. Watching makeup tutorials on YouTube (but never doing them because I lack all the skills and patience) 
5. Sitting in my room and singing along to all of my favorite songs 
6. Drinking cold water or iced green tea 
7. Shopping at Target and getting amazing deals from the clearance section 
8. Getting at least 8 hours of sleep 
9. Going to the Korean spa so that I can lay down in a hot room filled with thousands of clay balls that resemble coco puffs 
10. Knowing that me and BTS exist at the same time ",1,2

749,2018-6-14,2018,6,14,15,8qzpt7,Reason for BTS Success? Introspection,cactisun,1528958687,"This was just a thought I had after watching the 'Small but Definite Happiness' videos today, and I was wondering what you guys think. There have been articles written about their success that attribute it to things like their sincerity, writing their own lyrics, excellent dance/visuals/MVs etc (and I agree with all of them lol) but one thing I haven't seen brought up is how often they analyze themselves and their story, and how this is attractive to their fans. 

One of the early reasons I liked BTS was because of their vlogs. I thought they were a creative idea and loved that they talked about their personal stories a little. I think BigHit also does a nice job giving them opportunities to talk about themselves - they are always asked what the other members mean to them, to write letters to each other, to send words to their future selves, to tell something to their past selves. Not to mention all the free mixtapes of course, that clearly contain lyrics pertaining to their personal stories. I think it really highlights their growth and their humanity, and makes them feel so relatable to an audience. I mean, do other artists do this? Do you ever feel inspired to analyze yourself and your past/future differently because of BTS? Do you think there's another nuanced reason for their success that the media hasn't picked up on yet? 

Thanks for reading :)",2,3

How do you put up with BTS and being an adult?",Bea1023,1528959901,"I'm 29 yrs old and always loved music \- I listen to everything, from lofi to BTS, from classical music to SHINee. I have a full time job, I share an apartment with my bf and life's been pretty good. Lately, tho, I've been having problems with friends, and I mean longtime friends who do not understand my passion for BTS and even avoid mentioning it. Like, I got my ticket for the concert in Paris and they don't even ask me about it \- even if it's something obviously truly important to me.   
The fact that they avoid the topic and even become ""upset"" when I slightly mention them it's bothering me so much lately that I do not even want to hang out anymore. Sometimes I just need to go home after a 9 hours shift and relax \- and following BTS makes me feel better.

They're a big part of my life and something that really cheers me up and makes me smile. That should be enough for a friend, shouldn't it ? Apparently not.   
Luckily my bf is japanese and he's actually totally fine with me being a ""fangirl"" ( he loves J\-Hope ahah ) \- still, I'm turning 30 yrs old and I'm starting to feel like I should not spend so much time on BTS. But it's something that makes me feel so good and happy, why shouldn't I just enjoy it ? 

TL;DR : almost 30 yrs old, longtime friends do not understand my passion for music and BTS in particular \- how do you deal with being an older fan ?

I know it's partway through June already, but we just recently got finalized information back from Syria Cares, our May campaign partner, so I can finally share results with ya'll! The pretty Twitter breakdown with gifs and graphs is here [https://twitter.com/OneInAnArmy/status/1007248410334957568](https://twitter.com/OneInAnArmy/status/1007248410334957568) but for just the stats, check below.

Total for the Syria Cares campaign to provide  fast-breaking Ramadan meals to Syrian refugees living with food insecurity:

ARMY from 18 different countries donated 3,151.19RM (\~790 USD).

* That amount is enough to provide 211 individual meals, which translates to: - over 21 entire Syrian families who were provided with a meal thanks to ARMY OR - 7 people provided with a meal each day for the entire 30 days of Ramadan.
* As with the last campaign, Syria Cares provided us a certificate - the certificate, they said, is for one in an army (that's you!) and they will be mailing it to BTS at Big Hit at the end of Ramadan! But since the certificate is acknowledging One In An ARMY and that's all of us, we encourage you to go on and print that sucker out, frame it and put it up on your wall or however else you want to display it, because you're friggin amazing. (also if you frame it and hang it, please send us pictures, we love that kind of thing)

Now on the the campaign for June! As we said we are working with Unicef's Love Myself ENDViolence project for this month, so the name of the project is  [~~#~~**ARMYLoveMyself\_June**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ARMYLoveMyself_June?src=hash) . We choose this project, as a lot of other people did, due to it being BTS's fifth anniversary and wanting to support a project directly tied to the boys, even though we won't have tangible results to let everyone know about at the end of the month. The instructions on how to donate are here [https://twitter.com/OneInAnArmy/status/1003109961109557250](https://twitter.com/OneInAnArmy/status/1003109961109557250).

We will be supporting a water access based project in July, but we can't give you a specific organization name quite yet, as  we are waiting on some replies and confirmation from other parties. We are also looking into the possibility of doing birthday charity projects for each of the members starting in August, trying to pick causes that relate to what they are passionate about. If you know anyone else who is doing something similar, let us know, so we can potentially coordinate with them. 

As always, we are open to all questions, please forgive any delayed responses, as it's been a crazy couple of weeks!  Now that our results from last month are finalized, we should be able to go back to giving updates in the Weekly Bangtan Room. Seeing all the things that the projects team here helped accomplish for #ARMYMustServe was super inspiring as well!  We purple you all! ",2,81

I wanted to make those on /r/bangtan aware of a current project from one U.S. BTS ARMY fanbase.

**About:** The BTSx50States Geofilter project is basically to create beautiful fanmade geofilters for ARMY to use at the U.S. Love Yourself Tour stops, on the day of the concerts. ARMY with snapchats can use these filters while they are capturing memories of the concert day.

\~

In order to provide the geofilter for one of the concert days at each city (LA - Sept 8th; Oakland - Sept 12th; Newark - Sept 29th, Fort Worth - Sept 15th; and Chicago - Oct 3rd)  the total cost has been calculated to be around $1,501.  Prices are based on the exact size of the venue.

The time availability of the geofilter will be from the moment concert venue doors open and of course, during the show.

\~

**Where to donate**: [www.paypal.com/pools/c/84Iew4Jj7r](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/84Iew4Jj7r)  (donations are accepted until July 28th, currently 14&amp;#37; funded )

I personally was introduced to them when I asked my friend who I knew was a big fan, to tell me about them.

I think it would help my mom reconsider her stance on them. I don't expect her to become a hardcore ARMY or anything, but it would be great if she could move past their looks and see what amazing guys they actually are. 

Also, any suggestions on what BTS videos to show her? I considered showing her the Blood Sweat and Tears mv (the song that made me a hardcore ARMY), but I think she would disapprove of their looks even more. Maybe something like Not Today might be better?",56,97

822,2018-6-17,2018,6,17,3,8rl5hz,Special aspects of BTS songs about heartbreak and breakups,inceptionphilosophy,1529172713,"So i was listening to some groups recently and as expected there were  many songs about love, heartbreak and break ups.I noticed how many of those songs were filled with negativity and hate towards the other person and consider yourself to completely correct. In many break up songs there is this concept of playing the ""blame game"" and saying how you were always right and the other person is wrong, and many such lyrics curse the other person and say things like  he/she will die alone and he/she is worthless, you should have treated me like a princess it is your loss etc.

All the songs BTS has made about heartbreak and breakup never ever play the ""blame game"". Their songs always try to find what went wrong, what they did wrong and now that everything is over how to deal with the situation positively. They have never doomed the person on the other side for being bad to them and this has always been a feature of their songs.


Some classic examples of such songs are


1.What am I to You-(d&amp;w)- we can clearly see the girl is being an asshole in the relationship, still the song never calls her names, it is about what went wrong, what made the girl behave like that, and how should the singer rectify that fault.

2.Let Go-This is such a positive song. They just accept this breakup as their fate and the relationship couldn't work because their paths were destined to diverge and even try to bid the person a happy goodbye.

3.Outro- Tear- This is kind of controversial because they themselves are at fault for not being genuine in the relationship. but still there is this getting over whatever happened and facing your fate there and then because you eventually have to face it sooner or later.

And there are so many many examples of such songs in their discography. Do you think their breakup songs are a reflection of how they themselves deal with hard times in their lives?? Facing their fate and looking for solutions to the problem instead of crying over spilt milk and most importantly not playing the blame game which is the natural human tendency after a bad event occurs?

What are your thoughts on this aspect of their lyricism?

For RMs rapping style I'd go with his ddaeng or outro: tear rapping (that killed), for hobi I'd go with cypher 4 rapping, for yoongi, honestly anything would work.   


MV: Compared to other hiphop MVs like no more dream, mic drop etc. I'd rather have it have poppy colours, maybe make jin charismatically flash with money while sitting in his kingdom with his crown. RM have his own set while being president and giving the middle finger to every1 (cus he's our president ;)) ) Taehyung would be on his gucci runway wearing the most expensive clothes while riding the fiercest shiny black horse while he's wearing red lipstick (idk i love make-up on boys, i think it looks so heckin cool), J-hope would be on a glammed up carriage driven by the people in black costumes (meaning the haters is what makes them go even further, omg im so cringe), jungkook would -y'all gonna laugh but- he would own a stripclub and have both male and girl (cus INCLUSIVE) strippers doin their thang while he smokes his bLUNT (wow im cringing) AND JIMIN WOULD WEAR THE SAME THINGS AS TROYE SIVAN WORE AT HIS BLOOM MV WITH THE SAME WAKE UP WHILE HOLDING A LEASH WITH FIVE BLOOD HUNGRY HOUNDS

LAST BUT NOT LEAST IN MY BADASS CRINGE MUSIC VIDEO WHICH PURPOSE IS TO SAY F\*\*\* YOU TO THE HATERS AND SHOW BTS' INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY (tbh, the contrary) IS SUGA !!!!!!  

suga would be the only non-cocky one because everyone expects him to be the cockiest and most fierce while he's lil meow meow. therefore I'd have a whole white set with 100 kittens cuddling with suga :)

Like certain words or phrases were just bleeped... I looked up lyrics thinking that yeah I know the boys throw a few curses here and there but I wasn't sure if they were.

BTS really came and SHITTED on my very prudish views. When learning about them out of curiosity, I fell in love with how human and transparent they were w/ their fans. **Sharing their insecurities, hardwork, fears about their future, success, etc., brought about a unique aura to them. A color of warm authenticity.** In a way after seeing that, I no longer saw them as a bubblegum pop band (not that theres anything wrong w/ those), but more of a group with something to say like Linkin Park or even NWA.

I'm fine with some mistakes happened in a rush but I don't like how it's not corrected later.

There are so many lyrics channels. Atleast one could have high quality translation like [doolsetbangtan's translation](https://doolsetbangtan.wordpress.com/bts-albums/) right?

Do you guys know any channels with good translation?

I am planning to have my hair cut soon with a professional hairdresser. I've always wanted to have longer hair as a form of self-expression and have recently looked into Jungkook and RM's hairstyles as inspiration. So far, I've gathered these photos so far to show the stylist as reference:

I've been growing the crown area of my hair out for the past half year (the front/bang portion of my hair is 15cm, the center area is 12cm, and the back is only 9cm due to a mistake with my last stylist) while leaving the sides and back shaved short, like how a ""two-block cut"" is described. I also have Asian Hair so it's thick and stiff. Even though it's straight, it often curls in awkward directions, the longer it is.

To be clear, I'm not looking to do all these hairstyles at once. With a bit of product and advice, I can style my own hair into whichever way I want (comma hair, bangs covering forehead, swept-back, etc.) in the shower. But before I can do any of that, I need my hair cut into the ""foundational"" two-block style that all of these photos have cuz right now, I feel like I'm doing something wrong in how I'm taking care of it.

So for those knowledgeable, here are my questions for you:

-How do I better describe the BTS-inspired two-block cut to the stylist? What do you think are the measurements?
-What do I do with the hair at the back, in particular? I've been having a hard time with that.
-Should I straighten my hair? Chemically or using a straightening iron?
-What products should I be using to style it? Pomade, hairspray, wax, etc.?
-How do I soften my tough hair? I currently only use argan oil-based conditioner (shampooing every now and then to get grime/product off) and sometimes apply argan oil post-shower.
-Do you have any other Jungkook/RM photos I can use as reference?

I'm truly thankful if you can help me answer any or all of these questions ",20,56

I keep thinking I will wait for them to come back but I doubt I would ever get a ticket at face value.

So here are my questions which I hope someone can give me advice for:

-Is $400-500 bucks too much for nosebleed seats? Is that price worth it? (If anyone has gone to Newark please let me know!)
-I would be going by myself. I don't have anyone in my life that likes BTS (or KPOP in general). Has anyone else gone by theirselves too? What was your experience?
-What kind of merch do they sell typically at venues? I realllyyy want an ARMY bomb and  possibly a hoodie or t-shirt. Do they tend to sell out?
-I want to get assigned seats and not standing. I don't think I can handle the mosh pit. Do people tend to stay in their seats and not take other peoples?

I have only gone to one concert in my life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! It doesn't have to be related exactly to my questions. First time BTS concert advice would be lovely. Thanks!",90,44

I have always been wondering if there is anyway this stereotype can be removed. The media keep on keeping them in that category which reinforces the general public that the fans are only there for their looks and not music. From my own perspective, i find it funny because there are many other kpop groups whose members are handsome as it is a requirement for an idol. I think the public is not aware of this so that is why they are limiting BTS to this demographic. I find it kind sad that people categorize music like this. Well that is what I think and so I want know any of your opinion on thi matter.",2,1

Two that I think are very different are ""If I Ruled the World"" and ""Sea"" which are not only stylistically completely separate but have very different messages about fame and money and what it means to gain wealth and status. One presents a pretty picture of what a future full of riches would mean while the other shows how easily that image becomes complicated, difficult.

I just got my 9th tattoo but as the title says its my 1st one since moving to Korea in November 2016, and I made sure it was BTS.

Id been following a tattoo shop on FB since moving here after hearing recommendations. Two days ago they offered a buy 1 get 1 free tattoo deal so my (other ARMY) bezzie and I split the price! 

Its in Gangnam, near Sinnonhyeon station called Tattoo Korea. Awesome credentials, been around for yonks.

I went tonight. As Im waiting for the artist to draw my tattoo up, Im chatting to the owner (Korean-American) and looking around.

Then I see it. I get so excited that as I jump up from the couch I dislodge the glass covering from the sofa table 

A signed 2 Cool 4 Skool album.

Whoa, where did you get this signed BTS album?
We designed the logo for their first album!

 MIND. EXPLODES. 
Am I bad ARMY? How did I not know this?! I LIVE HERE, WTF JANELLE.

He also tells me they designed THE bike - *yea, that bike!* -  they ride in the debut video, too! 

**Long fangirl moment short, I cannot believe my first BTS tattoo was, by happy accident, done by the same shop that designed their debut logo.** Just..... yaaaassssssssssss!

[Here are pics from the shop &amp; my new tattoo!](https://imgur.com/a/BbTbeeh)

If youre near Seoul, I highly recommend them. 

The lyrics are from Spring Day 

 The morning will come again
Because no darkness
No season
Can last forever

Thank you for reading, haha. I might add some flowers or something to it later down the road but for now it balances out the song lyrics on my other arm.

#Regarding Memes, Fluff, Showerthoughts and Shitposts in general

Some time ago we received a suggestion through modmail for a meta subreddit in which memes could be posted. 

We know a few of you quite like your memes, but also know that quite a lot don't wish to see that sort of thing on this sub. 

Thus, we are happy to announce the little experiment that is **/r/BTShitpost**. All memes, fluff content etc should go there. 

We'd like to remind you all that subreddit rules still apply there, so: no paid content, bashing, drama or NSFW content. Keep it PG and family friendly. 

Since we have been quite busy at this time of the year, this will be our little 30k gift to you all: free reign to meme. 

We hope you have an enjoyable time!

936,2018-6-20,2018,6,20,11,8seubf,What does it mean for the quality of music to go down?,smartviolette,1529462875,"HOW I GOT TO KNOW BTS:

I entered the fandom last year november without any knowledge of what Kpop is but only acknowledging them as a group since I never thought of them as a ""boyband"". I started with exo but wasn't naturally drawn to them like I was with BTS immediately I discovered them. I listened to exo ""Overdose"" about 4 years ago when it came out through a friend. However, at the time, I was a person that barely listened to music since I had other things in mind. I didn't understand what the bbmas and amas was until I discovered BTS with Blood, sweat and tears. It was until last year november that I felt bored and checked out exo with call me baby which I enjoyed but as I listened to more of their music, I saw bts blood, sweat and tears in a reactions mashup and searched it up on youtube. For some reason, I was instantly drawn towards them. Through them, I also learnt how naive I was about a lot of things and have become a lot more open minded. Right now, I am of the age of 17.

MAIN QUESTION:

I think BTS is always releasing great music. Do you think people's subjectiveness or preference in music prevents them from acknowledging that a particular song from BTS or any other group is good or great?People that say that BTS's music has been going downhill since run or bst era are judging based on preferences. For me, I know BTS know what they are doing and seem happier with everything. I enjoy BTS because they have something they want to say and express through their music. They are always telling stories through their and make sure they experiment with genres that find interesting. I always find it exciting because I always wonder what kind of genre they are going to use in their next album. I think it is better you never expect a specific sound from BTS because you may like it but who says other people won't hate it. In general if you don't expect that sound and open your mind to other kind of sounds or genre, you will enjoy their music a lot. I think this is what some people need to understand because who is to say that they might not dabble with a genre you like after the next album or the love yourself series is over. I find it very funny when people say their quality is going down when they seem to be improving in a lot of things every comeback. It is said ""Music is Subjective"". Apart from BTS, this question can also be applied to any other group. Don't allow your preferences to discredit the kind of music BTS or any other group is doing.",3,2

Him, Ethan, James Charles and Emma laugh at this comparison which caused a backlash.

After tons of responses calling him out for mocking idols who are over worked by their companies and faint due to lack of rest/food/exhaustion, Grayson [tweeted](https://i.imgur.com/Lbre0Cd.jpg) a half assed apology, and went on to claim that was his attempt at raising awareness of the situation surrounding idols and their companies...and also says HE FORGIVES the PEOPLE who called him out..? Literally made no sense.

I guess he sort of caught on to people not buying his ""sorry"" tweet, and calling him out on making his mockery fit his own agenda by saying it was him raising awareness, hence tweeting hours later a second ""apology""...still not buying it. Hes only sorry his image is getting dented.

People tormented her and claimed she was faking it because she wasnt constantly sitting in her wheelchair.





WELL I HAVE EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, AND IM HERE TO TELL YOU HOW DISABILITIES ACTUALLY WORK, PARTICULARLY THE INVISIBLE KIND! 






So first and foremost, you cant tell if someones disabled just by looking at them or their actions.
If you see someone normal looking sitting in a section reserved for the disabled, they ARE in fact disabled! Their disability probably isnt obvious, but its still there and is causing them significant issues, to the point where a reserved seat or line might be vital for them to make it through the night. Dont try to take that from them, its not okay!







Medical conditions arent always predictable, so neither are our needs.
Going back to KCON, the girl wasnt using her wheelchair consistently. Thats actually very normal for people with disabilities! Different situations require different tools; walking around a sweaty, crowded convention or concert, a person may choose to make their day easier by using a wheelchair or walker. It saves time and energy, and prevents major injuries. But when looking at a raised booth or trying to see above a crowd, they may feel comfortable standing up for any length of time. If you make them feel like they cant adjust for their personal comfort, youre essentially trying to exclude them, whether you realize it or not.







Call out culture is toxic for those with invisible disabilities or illnesses.
I get it. There are actual assholes in the world, and you dont want them thinking its okay to use services for the disabled if they dont actually need them. But who are you to make that call? More often than not, vigilante justice is a disservice to people with invisible illnesses because people assume were totally healthy and are just being assholes. We get glared out, scolded, and even forcefully removed from places that were built for us because we dont match societys definition of disabled. Trust me, its better to let a dozen people abuse the system than to keep even one person from getting what they need.







So at the concert, PLEASE refrain from making armchair diagnoses. PLEASE refrain from trying to judge if someone is 'disabled enough' to be doing something that's making their day easier. Just...please try to be nice.",1,1

here's the link to where it's uploaded: 
https://usuallyscreechingglitter.tumblr.com/ 

and here's the text: 


To Bang Si-Hyuk and Big Hit,

Due to recent events related to BTS's current release (Love Yourself: Tear) and since the majority of the initial problems have been resolved; we, the International ARMY (hereafter: I-ARMY), believe in you both personally and publicly.

The most immediate issues to be addressed are currently hindering BTS's success are the following:

SEO tags on many of BTS's videos, including the latest release of 'Fake Love', are corrupted or improperly tagged. This includes MVS and current album track uploads.
MVs are not properly linked to streaming outlets (such as Spotify)
As recorded by google top trends directly after the release ( https://twitter.com/BTSanalytics/status/998410542627909632     ), the top general public searches included ""Freaky Love"". This is what the western audience will hear in radio play and will use in search. This tag needs to be added to the 'Fake Love' MV.
There is no accessible liaison account for press, radio, and ARMY to contact Big Hit in either an emergency or a media advantage.
The reason why the above are important:

Improper SEO tags on YouTube MVs works against BTS's stated goals and Big Hit's profit line. Not only does it limit the capacity for streaming, it reduces media traction since neither the poster nor the reader has easy access. Other content creators (reactions, full album uploaders, lyric videos) become listed first since they are properly tagged. The heaviest indirect market is affected by improper tagging and loss of iTunes and other platform sales. The bulk of the Western public uses YouTube as a free preview before purchasing.

Many I-ARMY spent the first 24 hours of Fake Love's release contacting YouTube. When I-ARMY was not working with YouTube they were contacting google, shazam, spotify, lyric sites, billboard and other media outlets trying to get links and information corrected. All of this could have been avoided if the ARMY had an open line of communication with Big Hit. Any staff from Big Hit to access the YouTube account would have been able to repair the issue from wherever they were. Instead, ARMY has spent the bulk of the first day trying to release the Big Hit in every way possible including trending tags in both English and Korean.

Conservative estimate on sales data places Big Hit's revenue loss in the first 24 hours of release due to improper labeling is over $ 1 (US) million.

Other issues you may be aware of during release this release:

Amazon was not the only major outlet with premature release issues. Target was as well. I-ARMY spent hours working with Target attempting to resolve this issue (16 May). A compromise was reached where the albums would remain on the shelves, but purchasing would not be allowed until 18 May.
The deletion and reupload of Teaser 1 with the correct date cost BTS and Big Hit.
Google listed BTS's latest track as Drake's with Drake's lyrics.
Many major platforms, including Shazam, linked a teaser instead of the full MV for the first 24 hours and longer. This is attributed to improper SEO tagging which made the MV difficult to find the general public. I-ARMY had a problem with the platform.
Billboard ( https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8457059/ bombard boycott -best-moments-2018-billboard-music-awards ) and other outlets opted to link fan uploads of BTS's BBMA award win and performance since Big Hit did not upload their own YouTube channel. Uploading your own videos of wins and performances is common practice in the west.
Many important and worthy album reviews (Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, Spin, Headline Planet) have not missed opportunities by big hit not retweeting. This is a very useful tool for you.
Several important industry professionals have been snubbed by BTS not acknowledging their support (Ellen DeGeneres, En Vogue) or taking their support too lightly (John Legend). This too is easily corrected with an active liaison account. I-ARMY is aware of which important players need to be given attention and can bridge the culture gap for Big Hit.
Shazam is still showing the album picture as one from 'You Never Walk Alone' instead of the current release.
Other suggestions from I-ARMY for Big Hit:

Lyric Videos on the official channel. This is a common practice in the Western industry, and the language of the Korean language is a barrier to Korean market, new Western fans are confused as to why this is not being done. BTS and ARMY keep saying that lyrics are the most important part of their music and the connection point between the two, it seems that the general public merely lip service since Big Hit does not make this a priority.
Add subtitles to all the content. I would like to thank you for your support. If you do not currently have the staff to take care of this yourself, there are many great ARMY subtitlers that will be for you. Opening permissions are not difficult.
Post official ordering links specifically designed for the international market. By posting official Amazon links in Fancafe only; A site with the majority of BTS's international fans has no access, this is not only limited to the correct purchasing options for ARMY but excludes the general population that is a hardcore fan but newly and casually interested. The result was a large portion of sales going to non-official third-party sellers.
Hire English Language instructors for the members. In order for BTS to truly conquer the West, they need to be able to converse. We are all proud of them, but they are still in Korean, but we have to reign. Industry analysts and press discuss BTS as ""Bigger than One Direction"" and ""the next Beatles"", but the language that gives the appearance that neither Big Hit nor BTS are interested in reaching such an honor. Given that English lyrics are tucked into their songs, it should not be difficult for more than half of the BTS members to be passable by the next round of interviews with the upcoming tour. Broken English is acceptable. Memorized answers to script is not.
Trust I-ARMY and connect with them. We are aware that you trust K-ARMY, but if you truly desire to be successful outside of Korea, communication lines need to be open outside your own house. A &amp; R contact information needs to be available. An actively monitored account is connected with Big Hit staff and able to speak; at a minimum, English and Korean needs to be available 24 hours a day. I-ARMY is the best A &amp; R team you have. We raise the hype, we develop relationships with DJs and push the BTS into new radio markets, we have champions for interviews and press stories, contact television producers, and do the work behind the scenes to get. If I-ARMY has no way to share with Big Hit,
Final note:

We are very pleased with this. but as I-ARMY is attempting to form an open and honest relationship with you, we feel it needs to be said.

Some of us work in the industry. Some of us are clearly listed as mistakes. Some of us know just how much is riding for BTS on this release and what can be gained or lost.

Even though we are very proud of Billboard as a power player, those of us who are connected to the industry also hear what he said behind closed doors.

BigHit ""is a singular title. It is a prophecy that the company itself does not appear to be ready for the global platform for anything more than one hit status. We do not know what they are doing. Big Hit's current position is due to more to luck of BTS.

Please understand. No one in the industry is questioning BTS's ability to take their careers further, nor are they questioning the strength of ARMY fanbase or their dedication. No one is saying BTS is a fade that will quickly pass. They are directly questioning whether Big Hit is the right fit for BTS, because it appears; from a western standpoint, Big Hit will become what holds BTS back from achieving more.

Please also understand this. I-ARMY has kept the public persona for the sake of BTS that things are fine as we quietly fix Big Hit mistakes for years. We spun it as a ""is not this cute"" and laughed it off in public. But as ARMY grows, new I-ARMY is not aware of how to work in quiet. And with the overwhelming string of recent careless mistakes, their frustration is bleeding into the public eye. The rumbling voice of new I-ARMY and old has one main theme. We will always support BTS, but we will continue to support Big Hit or choose to lobby for BTS.

Thank you for taking the time to read. We hope that you will be able to achieve a positive working relationship on the BTS and BTS members in the near future.

Wishing for better days,

International ARMY

Edit: In the version sent to BigHit the English tutoring and lobbying for a new label was taken out so they could focus on our concerns properly.",13,0

Fake Love peaked at #10 at the hot 100, so does that mean that BTS has gone up in the mainstream ranks, with the song literally playing everywhere like something from Ed Sheeran or Shawn Mendes, or was the rank achieved mainly from fan streams?

Also compared to BBMA 2017 and AMA 2017, is it just me or the buzz for BTS wasn't that crazy anymore after they won again at BBMA 2018. At least on YT and media sites ",31,48

*Phew.* Another one.

I've heard some people are quite intimidated to join our Discord chat because they feel like everyone already knows each other so I'd like to talk a bit about that.

Joining a new community is the same as joining a new school: people will seem closer to each other than you because they have already spent some time to get to know one another. 

However, nothing stops you from going up to them *- or them going up to you -* to introduce yourselves and form some sort of bond.

This is how every single one of us were at first! 

Don't be scared, they are all very kind! 

Of course, there are jokes between them and things might seem a bit hectic sometimes since some of them love to pull pranks on each other, but nothing stops them from explaining things you!

I have watched that community grow and many new members arrive and I can attest it can be really fun.

Plus, the Discord moderators are there to help and guide you in whatever you need *(myself included)*.

Feel free to join our little internet corner **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/discord)**!

These guides were made with the intention of **making things clear to newbies and helping out those that don't know about extra features**.

&gt;###Even if you are a reddit veteran, please still take a look at the guide since a few of our rules are being explained. 

We have also made a few things clear which we hope you keep in mind.

1015,2018-6-22,2018,6,22,9,8sx5c0,Why The Bangtan Rap Line is Solid: An Analysis,princessdootdoot,1529628587,"# SOME BACKGROUND:

In the beginning of my journey with Bangtan, I was very much enamored by the Vocal Line, especially Jimin. I kind of slept on the Rap Line, even tho I am a fan (although not a hardcore stan) of Hip-Hop and Rap. But once SUGA hit me in the face with his SUGA-ness, the Rap Line took over my consciousness. It's not to say that I don't care for the Vocal Line, but the Rap Line has just garnered a lot of my interest and respect.

So much so, that I decided to read up on the [history of rap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping). ( Yes, I know, Wikepedia is not the most reliable source, but its where I started my search, so you can wet your feet here too.)  Its a music style that came into fashion in the 1970's and still has its hold on pop culture today, but it has its roots in centuries of African griots or storytellers who chanted their stories to the beat of an instrument. Rap is generally categorized by three main components:

&gt;The components of rap include ""content"" (what is being said), ""flow"" ([rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm), [rhyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme)), and ""delivery"" ([cadence,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_(music)) tone).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEdwards2009x-5) Rap differs from [spoken-word poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken-word_poetry) in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track.

""[Rap](https://www.etymonline.com/word/rap)"" is a word that originally means ""to hit"" but was then adopted and popularized as an American slang term in the 1960's to mean ""chatting"" or ""talking informally."" There's a common misconception that rap stands for ""rhythm and poetry,"" a misconception that I believed prior to researching the topic of rap and hip-hop. (Mind you, I'm not an expert.) But, in terms of Bangtan's Rap Line, I like to use this misnomer as a way to analyze just how solid SUGA, RM and j-hope really function as a unit.

To an extent I do believe that rap is a mix of rhythm and poetry. Poetry takes power over words and wielding that power wittily and effectively and the beat that rap lyrics are laid over definitely call for a solid control over one's rhythm. So, using ""Rhythm And Poetry,"" here's why I believe the BTS Rap Line is such an effective team:

# RHYTHM:

If you do a simple search of ""[rhythm definition](https://www.google.com/search?q=rhythm+definition&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS771US771&amp;oq=rhythm+&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.9488j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)"" into Google, you can see that rhythm calls for a control over patterns in the sounds that one makes. I 100&amp;#37; believe that Hoseok (j-hope) is the embodiment of rhythm. Both physically in his dance as well as in his rapping. If you listen to his mixtape, [Hope World](https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/sets/j-hope-hope-world), the tape carries varying genres but the overall consensus is that its a whole bop. Why? Because j-hope has this ability to lay down words in a pattern that makes you want to bop and dance and just move in general to his songs. 

In BTS songs, j-hope has this uncanny ability to liven a whole song up with his adlibs. For example, ""[Cypher 4](https://youtu.be/QLW2RACh7oE)"" holds very obvious instances of both Yunki (SUGA) and j-hope adlibbing (adding sounds as a way to hype up the song). But it is definitely j-hope that carries that adlibing almost all the way through when he isn't rapping. While Yunki will only occasionally add a few ""Ah-ha's,"" j-hope adds varying noises and adlibs on beat to keep the song bouncing. And if you watch the live performance of ""BTS Cypher 4"" (linked), at around 2:08, j-hope hits this section:

&gt;  ***/***    **/**  **/**   **/**  **/**  **/**   (okay)But **/**   **/**  **/**   **/**    **/**   

I separated it into the way it feels as he raps it (using **/** ), his rhythm bouncing from one  (-eh) sound at the end of each word to the next. Just listening to that section alone makes you appreciate the strength of j-hope's flow-- his delivery, his rhythm. 

# Poetry:

Namjun (RM) is the poetic master of BTS' Rap Line and BTS in general. From the [""Most Beautiful Moment of Life"" Interviews](https://youtu.be/UASDj0kHrDY), RM states that one of his more serious dreams for his future occupation was to be a poet and a writer. Listening to the lyrics he writes for a major body of Bangtan's discography, his personal self-titled mixtape, [*RM*](https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/sets/rm-rap-monster), his speeches/rants and even his pre-debut releases, its obvious that RM wields language and words like a weapon. When we listen to the any of the Cyphers, featuring all of the rappers, RM's parts hold the most flowery language and he employs more metaphors and literary devices in comparison to SUGA and j-hope. In the most recent Rap Line release ""[](https://soundcloud.com/bangtan/ddceremony),""  RM digs into the haters, employing a stutter: 

&gt;*(English Translation)*  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no uh- ridiculous  
Even if I st-st-stutter my words  
I h-hope you understand  
I la-la-lack a way with words  
Bu-but I try to speak correctly but my mouth keeps ge-ge-getting crooked  
Because I li-li-li-like it I li-like it very much

According to [this](https://muish.wordpress.com/2018/06/16/bts-ddaeng-english-translation-and-ramblings/) translation and analysis of the lyrics, this section of RM's verse is based on a Korean saying that translates to: ""Even if your mouth is crooked, speak the truth."" It is as if he is telling the haters that they are spouting lies if they denounce the skill and hard work of Bangtan's rappers and that they should reassess the situation, instead of simply blaming it. He also later likens these naysayers to frogs in wells, another Korean idiom of a frog who can not see the big wide world, thinking the well it lives in is its whole world. 

# AND:

In the genesis of Bangtan and SUGA's involvement with Big Hit Entertainment, SUGA had fully intended to remain behind the scenes as a music producer for the company. Fortunately for us, he is now one of the seven members that comprises BTS today. The reason why I put SUGA last and under the heading ""AND"" is because he as a rapper and performer has found a balance between both the rhythmic and lyrical aspect of rapping. To switch up my Cypher references a bit, let's take a look at ""[Cypher Pt 2: Triptych](https://youtu.be/VPiKvoCJQjo),"" most especially, my favorite version of it, the All Force One performance on September 20, 2015. (Linked is the SUGA fancam of this performance, for the sake of cohesiveness with this written section.) 

In this performance, we can see both j-hope and RM delivering in their expertise: j-hope anchors the song with his rhythm, not only with his adlibs and lines, but also with his delivery of the song's hook between each rapper's verse. All the  while, RM's verse is littered with literary bombs and lyrical fire. He hits with multiple references and metaphors as well as similes and onomatopoeia. But as we listen to SUGA's verse, we see how he wields elements of both. He  changes the cadence of his voice multiple times ( [for example, 3:10 vs. 3:35](https://youtu.be/VPiKvoCJQjo)) within the verse and even hits a section of speed rapping ([4:11](https://youtu.be/VPiKvoCJQjo)) which both deliver a similar effect to j-hope's rhythm. As for his lyrics, he has crafted witty insults and although they are not as poetic as RM's, they aren't plain either. For example: 

&gt;*(English Translation)*  
&gt;  
&gt;You think being escorted makes you powerful, I hope you put down your mic  
If I'm the sun, you're the moon, because when I rise, you go down  
All you hip-hip designer brand bastards, come down from the foamy bubbles

And my favorite: 

&gt;Like your parents, my heart hurts every time I see you

(LOL)

This, of course, is not to say that because SUGA has control over both aspects that he is the best Bangtan rapper. He has just balanced these components in a way that has made him his own rapper. The same goes for both j-hope and RM. I love them all individually *and* together. And just like the misnomer that we discussed, ""rhythm and poetry"" work all together in harmony. In much the same way, Bangtan's Rap Line has formed a formidable force in their harmony. ",73,341

1022,2018-6-22,2018,6,22,13,8syle9,Has the fandom always been so prone to shipping members together (and actually thinking that there is a hidden relationship)?,cactusaddict,1529642579,"Hi! I'm relatively new to the fandom and was greatly surprised when I noticed how many ships there are in BTS and how seriously the shippers are taking them (lengthy analyses on Tumblr and Twitter, video proof on YouTube with millions of views, etc.). Has it always been this way, or is it becoming ""worse"" now that BTS are known internationally? Of course ships have always been around but I feel like a lot of shippers now have their judgment impaired because of the Larry era on Tumblr (and I assumed some of them moved on from 1D to BTS). 

I actually don't mind ships, I enjoy it for the most, but a vast majority of shippers tend to go slightly overboard with it and it definitely creates some tension within the fandom. Everything the boys do or say is now related to said ship, everything is a proof, everything is about hiding the relationship, etc. How does it all make you feel? Do you simply ignore it, or does it bother you? Do you think it's partly the members' fault, since after all they're the ones doing the skinship and such? Do you enjoy these theories and think there is some truth to it? I'd like to know various opinions. :)

I truly appreciate how mature this thread is, I know ships aren't discussed here (for the right reasons, and you don't need to name any specific if it makes you uncomfortable!)",11,3

I learned about their reality show via clips from Mnet. I did some googling cuz the YT clips were horrible and incomplete. I found a site that has the whole series. Wow, I'm so impressed by how much they have grown up since then! I was so jelly at all the spots they filmed at cuz I've been to all of them.  I tried to imagine what I would do if I was there at the same time. Probably faint from excitement AHHH!

Also, Tae in silver hair would be cool (even though I'm still dying over his blond hair). I'd also love to see them with multi-colored hair more or each having a bright color (maybe colors of the rainbow?) at the same time. As for styles, I really have no idea.

I have very bad social anxiety so it takes a lot for me to even tweet, much less publicly request something from complete strangers (in this case, radio DJs for @MostRequestLive) I also hate cold calling, but been calling my local stations requesting FL despite being hung up on numerous times. I've opened up and initiated conversations with strangers like cab drivers etc about how amazing their music is. I know these are small, basic interactions for most people, but it's personally very draining and the fear of rejection is still overwhelming. 


But I realized that my love for these 7 special men has lead me to push myself far past my usual comfort zone. I've had not so nice responses but with every rejection, my anxiety feels a little more manageable and it's a little less daunting to make the first move. The desire to reach out and connect to discuss theories, analyse lyrics or just fangirl together also introduced me to wonderful people I would never have considered approaching. So in yet another way, being ARMY helped me face some personal phobias that would otherwise be ignored and hidden away. 


I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else feels the same? Also much love to fellow ARMY if you do face similar anxieties. I understand how difficult it can be but I think it's a testimony as to how inspiring Bangtan is, that people are willing to push ourselves in ways we wouldn't have, just to spread the Gospel Of Bangtan.",41,100

Because this would solidify the group's foothold in the music industry and so that people would stop saying that they only win because of the strong fandom. It would be nice if the general public would see that they are popular because they are talented and not just because they are active in SNS etc. I can only think of Grammy? I think that's also one of the reasons why Suga wants the group to have a Grammy.,33,66

How they have to create this beautiful lie to be loved by the audience (and tbh, fake fans), only to see the love they get was fake all this time.

Then i started thinking, it COULD apply to something else. Neither romantic love nor celebrity image.

People fake it til they make it. We project this image we want people to see in us. We pretend to be strong when we're actually hurting, pretend to be happy when we're dying inside. This ideal, faultless mask of someone we hope people will love of us for. Erase ourselves and be their doll. At one point maybe we couldnt even recognise who we are.

But what happens if the mask cracked, even for just once?

We get hate. Rejection. Goodbyes from those who prefer the masked perfection we created.

But it doesnt mean you lose everyone. There are those who still stands by you - those who accept you for who you are. Imperfections whatnot.

For the love we get to be real, we have to be honest with ourselves. Tell the truth untold, unveil the us we hid to the world we hide it from in the first place.

Being the real you = loving yourself.

As some of you probably know NCT 127 is in the US for KCON. They have done a slew of interviews and they have been really great thus far. I have tried to pinpoint what exactly the difference is with their interviews, but a part of me feels that they are being taken more seriously because they have two native English speakers (Johnny is from Chicago and Mark is from Canada) and a 3rd who is pretty fluent. During interviews they have 3 members sharing the translating duties and it's so much less awkward.

Jeff Benjamin released an article today for Billboard and this is what he had to say -

&gt;NCT 127 also proved they could easily and coolly hold their own with every member speaking throughoutthe 25-minute interview.Regardless if they werefluent in English, the nine members allchatted about the concept of their group, visiting New York, the languages they spoke and, in a particularly heartwarming segment, each membershared what they loved most about the guy next to him asJohnny and Mark seamlessly translatedfor any answers shared in Korean. Concern over language barriers have hauntedK-pop's possible U.S. transition, but the NCT boys proved quite the opposite and caught to even some of the more subtle jokes thrown by Kenney.

I can't help but feel that this has a lot of shade directed at BTS. Am I being overly sensitive? Do you feel that the guys are treated differently because of their lack of English skills? Will this hold them back from further opportunities? I am curious what everyone thinks.",4,1

So openness I would roughly define as: willing to share details about their personal lives/emotions with us. Being more/less open is definitely not a bad thing at all! But i think its fun to discuss which members are more ~~mysterious and which ones are more of an open book. 


So my ranking from open to closed would go: Jungkook &gt; Yoongi &gt; Joon &gt; Tae &gt; Jimin &gt; Jin &gt; Hobi


I think Jungkook is the most open because he shares a lot of details about his personal life and ambitions with us. His thank you letters are always very long and sincere, and he comes across as so genuine and loving in everything he does (not to say that the others dont!). 


Yoongi and Joon have their mixtapes where they revealed a lot of their inner emotions and thoughts while Hobi's one used a lot more metaphors and a lot less direct. He's a very mysterious man!


What do you guys think? Agree/disagree? What would your ranking be?

1128,2018-6-25,2018,6,25,23,8tr1lu,How I find out my own magic shop with BTS,pnl23,1529937747,"I knew BTS when I was in grade 10, when my bff got crazy over ""Boy In Luv"" and ""I NEED U."" I was like ""what, really?"" then I just forgot why I didn't listen to those songs then. Of course now I feel bad bc I didn't know BTS and ARMY earlier. Much earlier, I'm afraid.

Then it's my lil bro, who is pretty curious about other cultures. He first listent to BTS when I forgot to lock my phone screen, than BAM, that was how he became a bigger ARMY than me. Since he's young, he seems closer to my parents than me, and he keeps talking about BTS. Sadly, they seem indifferent because they thought BTS might soon disband like 1D and get me cry a river again, which they believed it was childish.

BTS proves them wrong. It's been 5 years and BTS boys are on their climax of their career. It's been 5 years and ARMY society has got bigger and bigger. It's been 5 years since they kept composing songs instead of leaving them entirely for the PD team. The list go on.

Noting that I have official been an ARMY since December 2017, when I got so down bc of my future. I firstly find them so inspired when RM had his speech on Billboard 2017 stage (oh insfire MAN YEAH!), then funny, then truthful, then all of those. I got better by myself. I used to cry on bed when I couldn't understand English, which I had used to be so confident about. I used to cry on bed when the-ones-who-I-thought-they-were-my-close-mates revealed their very real personalities, which they had tried pretty hard to conceal perfectly. I used to cry alone when my family tried to use their own logic to apply on me because they believe the child has to take after many traits of the parents and grandparents and even great-grandparents. They have their points, but that's not what I hope to be entirely. I'm really bad at explaining my thinking into words correctly w/o hurting anyone.

Now, though I know BTS don't know me, I lean on them psychologically. I hardly cry anymore, and when I get so down, I would watch BTS doing/saying silly but childlike things, then get back to study. My eyes are getting less swollen, my mind is clearer itself, tho not entirely but it is better than my-past-self. A lot. And that's how I find them when going into the magic shop.

I am a Korean-American and I've been teaching American students Korean since 2012. Last year, with my youtube discovery of MIC DROP, I became a huge fan of BTS and wanted to give back to this amazing community and also get to know fellow ARMYs by providing discounted Korean lessons to 10 ARMYs who are willing to learn Korean. 

I utilize a lot of BTS lyrics, gif, and memes as part of my lesson and I adjust to the student's needs (TOPIK, conversational, attending Korean University, meeting BTS in Korea) as I create my lesson materials. 

My prices start from $30 (45 min lessons) $35 (60 minutes) and $45 (90 minutes). If you are an ARMY (registered on this Reddit and/or has an active Amino account) I will discount the lesson price for $10 dollars. ($30 = $20, $35 = $25 and so on). I have an active profile on Takelessons.com so please check out this link (https://takelessons.com/profile/ivey-e?service=korean) for more details. If you'd like to preview my lesson material or meet me before reserving a lesson, schedule a free 30-minute consultation by PM-ing me! 

Thanks and have a wonderful day!",0,6

I was perhaps silly and bought a ""verified resale ticket"" off Vivid Seats after trying for an hour on Ticketmaster when tickets came out because scalpers snatched them all up and Ticketmaster kept crashing and I would lose my tickets after 30 mins of waiting.

I did see another person in a similar situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8h1xtv/180504_powerhouse_released_a_statement_about/

The only difference is that I have received e-tickets already. They look official and are from Ticketmaster.

With all the talk about scalped tickets being canceled, I'm freaked out that the tickets I bought will be canceled and I'll drive all the way to Newark from DC just to get turned away.

Does anyone have advice for people like me? Do we just take our chances? Should we eat the cost and try to buy other tickets closer to the event? I honestly (stupidly) didn't think I had any other choice if I wanted tickets. Is there a way I can verify my tickets before I drive to Newark?

Thanks to anyone who will help. Sorry I contributed to the problem, I didn't mean to. ",11,5

1164,2018-6-27,2018,6,27,2,8u1zq5,"LY Storytelling: smeraldo, theories, criticism",bellaofwar,1530034621,"So I've been thinking lately how we are one album away from the ending of the series and yet we have no actual direction as to where exactly the storyline is going. I'm kind of getting frustrated with bighit, to be honest. The thing is, they hinted at a lot of things yet didn't really bring to actual fruition any of them. One of the things that still have me wondering the most is the whole Smeraldo flower blog thing. I don't understand what was the point of bringing it up when you aren't gonna further develop it consistently through time, I think that's a waste of a great opportunity for many reasons. Also, there were so many different things on that blog that I wonder if they really knew what they were doing or was it an experiment and they didn't expect ARMYs to react this fast. In all honesty, if they don't bring it up for the next comeback that will be a huge disappointment, or even if they bring it up but none of the things that were originally mentioned are further developed into the storyline even thought fans spent time analyzing, then what's the point. And there were truly a lot of different hints from playcards, to the fictional character Ashbless, to the emerald city, even a geography map, a portrait, a tarot card, a woman that is a fortune teller, etc., and I honestly have no idea how they plan to make all of this blend with the current things they gave us like the magic shop and the masks in a way that it will all make sense for the most part. I really think they should have taken advantage of the blog and updated it slowly through time so it keeps the fandom engaged and focused on the message they try to convey, I think they should have done the same with The Notes as well, releasing a note each week or month and I think it would have been great if those were translated by them because with fan translations some details are lost and translations vary, we can't really afford mistranslations if we are to follow an already vague storyline to begin with. Some people thought the whole Smeraldo and The Emerald City thing could possibly tie to the Wizard of Oz but I can't really figure out in what way if so, the connections aren't that much at least for me. Anyways, one thing I think was kind of obvious when it comes to the content on the blog is that they put an emphasis on cards 'cards', be it playcards or tarot cards and I wish they would reveal something more about this but as the same time I myself can't even tell how it can possibly relate to anything. That was until Ddaeng to be honest. I know it's a diss track but If you read the translations which I'm sure you have, you've noticed all the word play they do by referring to the korean card game, I don't know for what reason but that just made me think of the way playcards were mentioned on the blog and even Ashbless himself is a creator of playcards, the theorist in me thought they might be giving us somewhat of a spoiler, what do you think? On top of that it's for Festa and released for free so I think that makes the chances of an easter egg being hidden even more likely. Then there were the glitches for Festa that I still don't know what purpose they had, was it just for aesthetics? Then during their Lotte concert recently the VCR again had a lot of glitches, codes, etc. kind of effects, and interestingly there was one scene of BS&amp;T among scenes from Fake Love mv which was weird to be, why would they make a BS&amp;T throwback? A lot of ARMYs also found hints in the VCR related to a vinyl and interestingly those teasers for Festa which we thought has the image of a radar, seem to might as well reassemble a [vinyl](https://twitter.com/kkokkomadian/status/1010486310211993602) , so then there's that mystery too. lol So in short, what are your thoughts? It seems like we're being pulled in different directions all the time. I really want to hear different opinions and I hope some of you have better ideas of what exactly is going on and how are they eventually gonna make it all come together for the last part of the series. lol",3,1

To RM it means shedding tears
To Suga it means tearing apart
To J-Hope it means fear""

1198,2018-6-28,2018,6,28,3,8uca77,why i fell in love with BTS: an appreciation post,peachybees,1530125596,"**JIN** (**SEOKJIN****)****:** If I took a shot for every flying kiss Jin has ever given on live television (even at the damn Billboard awards this man could not be stopped) I'd be comatose and I wouldn't even regret it. The best part is - he knows how cheesy he is and just *owns* it like he patented being *The Most Extra Man Alive*. And I don't care what anyone else says, Jin's puns make my day every time I hear them and I don't even speak Korean to truly understand them. I can just imagine all the equivalent English puns he could make and it fills me with joy. 

Something I learned about Seokjin after getting into BTS, is that he doesn't push the younger members around like some hyungs are expected do. He gets flack for it - but I really do think it's more of a testament to his personality that he doesn't get as threatened by the apparent 'lack of respect' it entails when he's friendly when playing around with the younger members. He knows that his younger members respect him, and he clearly cares more about being close to his boys than upholding a classic age hierarchy. He *wants* to be childish and have fun with them, he wants to be a hyung they can rely on and be able to tell things to - and they do. 

Just like all the members of BTS, his genuine efforts to become better at everything he does, especially his singing which I know he isn't always the most confident in, could make my chest burst with how proud it makes me. This man even took up learning how to play the guitar so he could keep honing his skills and possibly also contribute to the composition of BTS songs - anyone who sleeps on Kim Seokjin is a damn fool.

**SUGA (****YOONGI****)****:** Lots of people look at Yoongi and only see his serious side - many people will see his 'cold' outward appearance and not look any deeper but wow are they missing out because this man is the softest baby I have ever seen in my life. There are countless compilations of Yoongi being the cutest, weirdest lil dork there ever was and I am the proud leader of the Min Yoongi Protection Squad. I love watching him react to his member's ridiculousness with that lil smile in the background and teasing them for it, his understated humour that actually leaves me dying of laughter when I least expect it. (*His gummy little smile, Jesus take the wheel. Like are you kidding me?)*

His voice when talking and rapping - the way he slurs when he speaks is really endearing to me? I love his little lisp he gets sometimes and the way his voice is so raspy. The passion with which he raps is so distinctive, I would know it was Yoongi rapping even if I was drunk and half deaf. Have y'all *heard* him growl in the live performance of *DDAENG*? Bitch my wig was in *orbit*. 

I'll also never forget the way he quietly looks after the other members, often not saying anything but showing his affection through little actions like passing them water without being asked, or putting food on their plates and telling them to eat. It really goes to show you don't have to be ridiculously love-dovey to look after the people you love, and it's one of my favourite traits of his. 

**J-HOPE (****HOSEOK****)****:** I think it's genuinely impossible for anyone to look at Hobi and not smile, just watching him makes me happy to be alive. You can really see the lust for life this man has and it's so incredibly infectious - if joy could be encapsulated in one person, it would be Hoseok. 

I think Hobi is the kind of guy to take all of his negative energy and channel it into something that makes him happy. Every time someone didn't believe in him or told him he couldn't do something, he threw all of that bad energy into proving them wrong and doing it with a smile on his face. I have never aspired to be more like anyone else in my life. The stage presence this man has while he's dancing? The visuals? It's downright rude and I would like my ovaries back in one piece, thank you. 

Also, I can't believe how anyone could sleep on this man's vocals. Every single time I've heard Hobi sing it's been nothing but a holy experience - petition for this man to release a vocal track please. And, of course, his rapping is something next level. I speak no word of a lie when I say I had his mixtape playing for a solid week with no break and I'm still not sick of it. His cadence, the way he just fucking *flexes* on everyone like it's his *profession*, like christ boy leave some for the rest of us, could you?

**RM (NAMJOON):** Joon might have the most beautiful mind I've ever encountered. His lyrics truly speak profoundly of his emotional experiences. This man was literally *made* to be a lyricist. I'm literally doing a degree in English/Creative Writing and many people I'm on my course with, including myself, can only aspire to wield words and language with the same fluidity and mastery this man does. Even his extended metaphors have extended metaphors and deeper meanings that takes multiple re-readings and in depth analysis to get everything he's saying. And to go as far as incorporating two or three other languages into his work as well as Joon does... just wow, okay. 

When I first saw Namjoon, my first reaction was to how *different* he is. I'd grown so accustomed to a certain brand of 'idol' prettiness, that seeing an idol with such unusual and intriguing features kinda 'jolted' me out of my pretty boy induced haze. And when I tried to find out more about him, I was just so shocked to see that so many people found him unattractive. I think people truly do forget that the real beauty is in diversity, rather than one homogenous idea of what's considered attractive. 

I absolutely adore his smile, and how he kind of smiles with his whole *being* rather than just his mouth. I love his dimples, even just the way he observes things - Joon just has such an air of gentle curiosity, and I'd love to see the world from his eyes, I have the feeling I'd learn a lot. This man *is* my ultimate bias, so maybe I am kinda (well) *biased*, but I can say this much with absolute certainty - Kim Namjoon is beautiful. 

**JIMIN:** I really wished this man could love himself as much as we love him, one of the first things I learned about Jimin was his self-consciousness over his own body, and how I wish I could just sit him in a room and talk to him about how amazing he is. I connect with Jimin over his self-image worries so much, I know just what it's like to see your body as imperfect and something in need of improving. I remember all the worried posts over him overworking himself and not eating right because he was self-conscious about his weight, and how much it killed me that I couldn't do anything about it. Lately, I think he's been looking much better and not too thin - but of course we never know what's going on behind closed doors. I hope the other boys are taking care of him just as much as he deserves. 

Among all of BTS, I think Jimin's work ethic is one of the most amazing. This man works so tirelessly to keep improving his art, to dance better (if that's possible), to sing better than the last time. I remember the members saying how he used to (and most likely still does) live in the practice room, always working on something and never stopping. His level of achievement isn't something that happened by chance.    

I love how he slips into Satoori when he speaks, his sometimes filthy sense of humour and his eye smiles. Jimin is the best when he's smiling. All the members say it's Jimin who they go to when they need reassurance and it definitely doesn't surprise me. This boy is worthy of all the love in the world. 

**V (****TAEHYUNG****)****:** Tae has always struck me as the softest member, there's something so innocent about him. I really think Tae has such a good soul, all he wants is for his friends and family to be happy and healthy, and to make them proud. And like the rest of BTS, he's *such* a hard worker. One of the best examples I can think of for this would be his recent ascent to becoming a part of the Dance Line - when I look way back to then BTS debuted to now, with his M/V for Singularity, I feel nothing but pride and awe at how far he's come. That footwork could make the *gods* quake. 

And okay, *his smile.* Oh my god, you can't look at his adorable lil boxy smile and say he isn't the cutest thing you've ever seen. There's just something so infectious about it, his goofy little grins, his eye smiles, the way he looks so happy with himself after he says something he's proud of... I would actually give my life for this man. He's so loud and full of life, so eager to alleviate any stress his members may have and always be there for them - he's one of the sweetest souls I've ever had the pleasure to watch grow and gain recognition for his work. 

And you can really tell how grateful he is to all of his fans, because without us he says he would have probably stayed a farmer with the rest of his family (which certainly isn't a terrible way to live, but I'm so happy he became a part of BTS), and how because of us he gets to really make his family proud. And for all that he's grateful to his fans, I'm even more grateful for him giving us another member of BTS to love, and for him working hard every day to show us his art. 

**JUNGKOOK:** I fell in love with Jungkook through his personality first and foremost - he truly reminds me of the people I surround myself with in my everyday life. He's ridiculous, his expressions are priceless and he genuinely loves the people around him. I think it might be that genuine love for his members and his drive to become successful that endear him the most to me. After all these years of following BTS, we got to see him grow up from his adorable teen years and into the man that he is now - maybe it's weird and voyeuristic to feel like I've grown with him, too. 

Kookie truly is an amalgamation of all the boys put together. How he is now represents all the work the members put into raising him, and how they all gave him parts of themselves for him to emulate. I think by watching all the members through all their years of training is how he achieved the status of 'Golden Maknae', along with his own determination to succeed and make his hyungs proud. 

I love his little side projects that we works on just because he can and it's what makes him happy. I love listening to his covers and how his english pronunciation continues to improve in them. I love seeing his photography and his Golden Closet Films. Knowing that the ARMY dedicating themselves to BTS' success means we get to see all the things they get to do because of us... it fills me with nothing but joy.

Yesterday Blanket Kick came on and I completely freaked out as its been a while since I heard it (its my favorite song from D&amp;W). I proceeded to listen to 2 Kool 4 Skool, O!RUL82?, Skool Luv Affair, and Dark &amp; Wild at work and nostalgia and happiness really flooded through listening to their older stuff.

So for this Throwback Thursday! An ode to 2013-2014 Bangtan Sonyeondan. Feel free to do any shoutout or comment on their older music and songs. Also I feel this would be a great way for new BTS fans to come in and get into their older albums.

Here are a few of my starter comments:

- 2 Kool 4 Skool: relistening to this it blows my mind how strong this mini was. When it first came out Like was my favorite song. It was a slow roll, but We are Bulletproof #2 took a few years for me to love. Now its one of my top 10 favorite songs from BTS. The song surprisingly runs deep for being a debut hype song. Like with JHopes lyrics: Look at my profile, theres nothing there yet. Still a trainee and rapper man, yeah I do know thats nothing. I contemplated a lot but now I dont need anything. In hindsight, this song is kind of everything now. 

- Attack on Bangtan: this song is straight up my favorite song from them of all time, and I just love this mini to death. A lot of these hip hop-styled songs back then really have a different flavor after the successes of BTS. What used to be a fun song has an elevated experience now. I listen to this song in hindsight of what would happen if Bangtan rises? and I get goosebumps. 

- Blanket Kick, 2nd Grade: If these 2 songs were part of Skool Luv Affair, I think that album thematically would be my favorite. Blanket Kick really brings a happiness and addresses crushes in such a youthful. 2nd Grade is really a progress check of how theyre doing, but done in such a clever way. BTS does a really great job fitting the High School theme for their older songs. It feels like growing up.",97,142

Also What are the variations from platform to platform from your perspective? I think twitter army tends to be more solo stan and their are definitely more multifandom among reddit army but not too sure.

What about you guys ? Are you multifandom kpop fan or just army? I am mostly an army but do like other kpop songs or groups . I think you need more commitment to be part of a fandom then to be just a fan so I will admit to be a shinee fan or mamamoo fan but won't exactly call myself a shawol or a Moomoo even if i have their albums and watch their stuff. I guess that would put me in solo stan category.

I opened my locker and then gave my key again to Jungkook, then he walked away. Where he was standing before there was men lying on the ground in white bathrobes. (Uhh I know I have weird dreams (: ) I was then going from my locker to search for him. But it didnt look like my school anymore, it looked all fancy and stuff. I saw stairs and when I went to them Jungkook was walking down to me from them.

They started small with Bang PD as the CEO and they only have BTS and one other soloist as artists in the company (ithink?)

I read a lot about big hit entertainment being different than the big 3.
I read many times that they treat their artists better, the artists have better contract conditions, no curfew, are allowed to talk about more, etc.
But usually I never really see the sources of this information. Where do people get this information from and when is it mentioned?
I'd love to learn more about big hit entertainment, which is why I am asking this.
