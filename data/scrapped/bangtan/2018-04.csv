I went and checked for myself and yes it's there! I don't think it's an actual glitch but a special effect they added to the video. If this is a comeback clue what do you think it means? [Go check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S3ZhJGv8JM)

Edit: Ok after thinking about this for a while here are my predictions for the comeback. I think it will continue the time traveling storyline from the last comeback. Maybe they will explore an alternate timeline where BTS never debuted (I'm basing this idea off RM's recent ""2013"" selfie). This comeback will have darker themes than the last one. Remember how the posters last year had two sides? Maybe they explore the idea of what happens when you don't love yourself? Based on some potential hints about dates, I think the comeback will be close to the date of the BBMAs. Maybe they will even have their comeback performance at the BBMAs. I'll edit this again if I think of anything else.

Edit2: What's even more crazy than the theories for this comeback is I just got reddit gold from someone because of this post. So thank you to whoever you are!",605,357,False,self,,,,,

1) Smeraldo. BigHit went to the trouble of creating a [webpage](http://flowersmeraldo.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/academysmeraldo/) page, an [email](https://twitter.com/BTS_All4U/status/895300833771782144) account, an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/flower.smeraldo/?hl=en) account, and a [twitter](https://twitter.com/FlowerSmeraldo) account. They rented a [truck](https://twitter.com/cutaehyvng/status/898199037551050752). They had a [fake address in Seoul](https://m.blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=testesso). They [sent flowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/6wro5m/update_from_one_of_the_winner_of_smeraldo/) to a select number of people who sent in stories. And then...nothing. Was that all for the Love Yourself: Her release? 

2) Highlight Reels. What's up with those? Are we getting a continuation in this comeback or are those over? It's a ""highlight"" but for what?

Don't think too much, just write the first few things that pops up in your head and keep it short and brief!

&amp;nbsp;

For me:

- watching EXO lose the daesang for the first time to a group I barely know... and thinking, ""it's time.."" as I watch these young kids crying in joy while clutching the award

- preparing to be judgemental towards BTS as generic kpop flower boys 

- googling song covers of Troye Sivan's Fools, clicking into the one with the most views, and being legitimately shocked that it's actually BTS 

- ""dammit BTS leave me alone, I told myself I'm not stanning anyone anymore""

- B-Free  Cypher 2  ""'*just go to Hawaii?*' HAHHAA, damn... they actually do have a backbone. ""

- *googles Korean dance videos*  *sees comment about Jhope's dancing skills*  *googles ""J-Hope dance""*  ""holy shit""

- ""what do you mean that they're not from the Big3??""

- ""**what do you mean that they're the only group of their company?????**""

-  is a name too beautiful for a generic kpop album, so this better be good

- crying over RUN 

- ""I'll stan Lumpens, but not BTS... I can't take it if a group I like ends up leaving again.""

- seeing Jin's HYYH speech, crying, and calling my mom. ""mom, I'll make you proud one day""

- ""I don't stan BTS. Yes, I stayed up all night for their Spring Day MV, but I don't stan them""

- ""I want to make a video like that one day""

- watching their MAMA 2017 win: ""Ha... I've really fallen hard for them, haven't I?""

- going to a concert alone for the first time.. I bought the tickets three hours before the concert. Man, that adrenaline rush..

I know I want to do a BTS song, but I'm having trouble picking a song, so I would love to hear your opinions on different songs. 

Which song do you think best represents you/reveals something about you and why?

Ive always been a person who comes in and out of fandoms. It was FBR and indie music first, then a bunch of tv show fandoms, then European football when I was in high school, then I got back into the rock/alternative scene, then it was 1D followed by EXO. Each of these phases lasted about 2-3 years, and though I still like all of these things, I dont follow them as closely as I did before and I dont participate in the fandoms anymore

But with Bangtan, Im 3 years into this ride and Im still just as obsessed as I was at the beginning. I thought maybe after LY:H, it would cool down, since I didnt really love the mini, but Im still here, and even though I dont love the new intro as much as I did the previous ones, Im still SO EXCITED for this comeback and ready to lose all my sleep and money. 

Im wondering if anybody else feels like this? Does Bangtan still command your attention after years of BigHit-related heart attacks?

I wrote up some tutorials for a few people who asked for help, but that could get lost in the comments, so I made this post. 
I didn't see anywhere that had all the steps laid out, including Interpark, and  the screens on Daum have changed since the sub made the FAQ / tutorial. 

Anyway, If you have more questions about exactly what the fan cafe or fan club membership are, please see [this previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7q6y52/bts_army_official_fan_club_information_faq/). 

-----------------

##Creating an Interpark Account##

Interpark is like a Ticketmaster service. You will purchase your fanclub membership through this account. This registration is pretty easy.

Go to [http://www.globalinterpark.com/](http://www.globalinterpark.com). In the top navigation, click register and sign up. **Where it asks for your name, go ahead and *put in your real name* in a format that matches whatever ID you might use to verify your identity, whether that is your passport or alien ID registration card.** I.E., if you're American, enter your real name in English. This is important for your fan club membership, in case you ever plan to actually use things like event benefits (only in Korea, as of this date). Your name will be printed on your fanclub membership card, and to use your benefits at events, you'll need your fan club card and an ID with the same name on it to verify your identity. 

For the sake of convenience, in case you ever have to talk to bighit staff or customer service about something, I also recommend using the same email address to sign up for Interpark, Daum, AND the bts store. You'll have benefits across these accounts and it can make things easier to just use the same email.

Although tickets for BTS events only show up in the search for items on the Korean version of the Interpark site, [http://ticket.interpark.com/Global/](http://ticket.interpark.com/Global/), you can use the login created on globalinterpark.com to sign in to both. 

Edit: BTW, if you don't have one yet, I recommend getting a password manager, like [Last Pass](https://www.lastpass.com/) to manage all your passwords. It makes sign in to sites that are in Korean very easy as it recognizes the login and password fields in the code and puts your auto-fill option there. It just makes it easier because you don't have to scan a page of hangul to figure out where the login boxes are, you just look for your little Last Pass icon and click sign in. (It also helps me keep track of my dozens of passwords without using the same one across sites, for security reasons).

----------------------------
##Creating a BTS Official Shop Account##

This year's announcement doesn't mention it, but one of the previous year's benefits included some shop-related things. So you may want to go ahead and set this up. 

One important thing to note, the logins for the [Korean version of the shop](http://www.btsofficialshop.com/) and the [English version of the shop](http://en.btsofficialshop.com/) *are different accounts* so create one for whichever store you plan to order from. I'm not really 100% sure how fan club benefits may apply (or even *if* they apply this year). But the process for creating an account is straightforward. Go to the site, click ""join"" in the top left of the page, and fill out your info. 

If they do end up providing shop benefits this year, you'll need to provide your shop ID (username) you select when you join. For the sake of convenience, I recommend making this exactly the same as the Daum ID you'll choose in the next section. If you ever need to find this info later, go to the shop, login, and click ""modify"" in the top left. Confirm your password, and your Shop ID will be the first item listed. 

-----------------------------
##Creating a Daum Account##

[View the full imgur album here](https://imgur.com/a/Ojwkq) and you can probably figure out how to sign up and adjust your settings by looking at these screenshots. For sight impaired users, or those who need more info, here's the step-by-step.

**STEP 1**:Go to [https://www.daum.net/](https://www.daum.net/). On the right side at the top, you'll see two login fields. [Click  underneath the login boxes](https://i.imgur.com/it2cgUX.png) to register a new account.

(FYI, if you use Chrome, you can right click anywhere on the page, and select 'translate' to translate the page into English.) 

**STEP 2:** On [this next screen](https://i.imgur.com/zzFeP29.png), you have the option of using your Kakao Talk account to sign in (top option with the yellow chat bubble) or setting up your own. Please be aware that although it is easy to change your nickname at will (which is just how your name displays on various boards) your ID is your login name, and you'll need to provide it to BigHit when you buy your fanclub membership in order to get your benefits on the BTS fan cafe. So if you use the K-talk login option, your ID will be based on your Ktalk account. I'm going to walk through the account setup with a mobile phone and email address (bottom option with the icon of a cellphone). Click the big blue button under the cell phone icon that says    (""sign up with a mobile number"").


**STEP 3:** [On the next screen](https://i.imgur.com/E3PfNow.png), check both boxes (these are your standard usage agreements) and hit the big gray button that says  (""agree""). If you get an error message here, please see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8abrqq/how_to_sign_up_for_the_bts_fan_club_create_and/dwxfbqy/) by /u/anyone-but-me . Some of these sites will not allow you to use specific OS + Browser combos :/


**STEP 4:** Next screen, I highly recommend using Google translate here to make it easy on you, but [here is the screen in English](https://i.imgur.com/5EC3biV.png). From the top down, the boxes you have to fill out:


* Choose an available ID (this is what you'll provide to Bighit, so choose carefully!)    
* Choose a password that is more than 8 characters    
* Confirm your password    
* Your Name
* Mobile phone number. Click the grey ""certification"" box that appears on the right in the mobile phone number field. This will send a verification code to your phone that you type into the next box
* Certification code. Enter the verification number you got in the text message to your phone. Hit the grey ""verify"" button to the right in this field, and it will tell you ""same,"" because it feels you, girl. 
* The final box is for your email address. Again, I recommend using the same one across your Interpark, Daum, and Bighit/BTS store accounts, as it just makes things easier. 

Hit the big blue button at the bottom.

Hooray! You have successfully signed up for a Daum account! You should now be logged in automatically, as well. But you're not quite done yet. Now you need to subscribe to the BTS fan cafe and adjust some settings.

----------------------------------------------

##How to Join the BTS Fan Cafe##

**STEP 1:** Go to the [BTS fan cafe](http://cafe.daum.net/BANGTAN). You'll get a pop up that is basically asking you if you'd like to join this cafe (you have to if you want to see any content). If you don't get the pop up, make sure you're logged in and come back. Click the blue button on the left of the pop up. If you can't ever get the pop up for some reason, just go to the cafe and on the left side, click the button under BTS' profile image that says  .

**STEP 2:** You'll arrive at the [subscription page](https://i.imgur.com/V6Kc9B2.png) with some information already populated. (Google translating this page doesn't always work.) 

* Check the box to accept terms (under the large frame of legal mumbo jumbo). 
* Choose a nickname (This is your display name on the BTS board. It can be different from your Daum ID, but to avoid confusion, maybe just keep it the same as your ID). 
* Check both the boxes in the following section (for notifications). 
* Type in the captcha in the next box. Hit the bolded button on the left that says  (join). 

**Possible Error:** If you see [this screen](https://i.imgur.com/aEx7vKz.png), you messed up the captcha. Hit the left button and try again.

If you are successful, [you'll see this screen](https://i.imgur.com/kUkONDC.png). Congrats! You are now a level 1 user of the BTS fan cafe! But don't leave this screen yet, we still have some settings to check. 

---------------------------------------

##Adjusting BTS Fan Cafe Settings For Leveling Up and Benefits##

**STEP 1**: If you're following this tutorial in order, from the last screen ^ [Click where it says   ](https://i.imgur.com/kUkONDC.png) with a little arrow pointing to the right. This takes you to the screen where you adjust settings specifically for the BTS fan cafe. 

**STEP 2:** 

Your [BTS cafe and privacy settings screen looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/oeHRS5i.png).

* The first box is your nickname (display name). You can change this at will and it does not have to be the same as your Daum ID, but to avoid confusion for yourself later, you may want to keep these the same. There are some guidelines for what you can use as your nickname in BTS cafe though. Do not use a members' name, don't use any profanity, and don't put emojis in there. 
* The next three boxes have to do with public availability of certain information (akin to ""show my ID"" ""show my gender / age"" and ""show my last date of activity). I'm pretty sure only your ID is required to be public for the purposes of leveling up, but since I don't put my gender/age information in my profile and I don't care if someone knows my last date of activity, I typically just set all of these to ""public"" / show. I'm uncertain if setting your gender/age (if you've even entered that) or last date of activity to private will affect anything in terms of leveling up or benefits. [Set all three drop downs](https://i.imgur.com/oeHRS5i.png) to the second option,   (public).
* The next item is for notifications. Check both boxes. 
* The next item is for your avatar. It defaults to the right side and will pick a K talk character for your default. 
 * If you want to cycle through options, hit the little X button in the top right of the character's picture to cycle through and find the one you want. 
 * To upload a custom avatar, click the gray button that says  and upload one from your computer, but I don't think you can do this until you are level 2? At any rate, your avatar doesn't really matter as you can't actually post anywhere as a level 1, and all the BTS members use the default avatars anyway, so it's not a bad thing. 
* The final option is the privacy of your blog. I just leave this set to the default, left option.

Click the bolded button on the left to submit. You're now all set up to level up and receive benefits on the fan cafe!

If you visit the BTS fan cafe, on the left side of the screen, you can click the little drop down that says   . It will [show your cafe nickname and what level you are](https://i.imgur.com/zZPZBBr.png). **If you ever need to adjust your nickname, avatar, or the privacy settings we just did, you can click the little grey  to the right of your nickname that is in this area.**

Down the left side of the screen, you can see the various boards. As a level 1, you can't post in or read most of the boards, but you now have access to read a few boards, including the Foreign BBS, and to try for level up. (You must level up to level 2 to actually post anything, to access most of the boards, and to get your free fan club benefits applied). Leveling up is its whole own thing and I recommend you look up a tutorial for that. You get special access to certain boards if you buy the fanclub membership, but, at least in 2017 (4th term), you had to already be level 2 for those benefits to get applied (it won't automatically bump you up from level 1). Again, the benefits are applied based on the daum cafe ID you supply when you buy your fanclub membership on Interpark. [See this post for a little more info on the fan cafe levels and how it interacts with your fan club membership](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7q6y52/bts_army_official_fan_club_information_faq/).

--------------------------------
##How to Buy 5th ARMY BTS Fan Club Membership##

**When can I join the BTS Fan Club?**

[BigHit has announced 5th ARMY recruitment](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2092648734083711&amp;id=561348433880423) will take place April 9, 2018 20:00 KST~ April 22, 2018 18:00 KST. You can only join during this period. If you miss it, you have to wait till next year and 6th ARMY recruitment. 

**What are the benefits of joining the fan club?**

See [this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7q6y52/bts_army_official_fan_club_information_faq/) for more in depth info, but BigHit outlines the [benefits for 5th ARMY](https://scontent.fbna1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/29791348_2092646604083924_3388643022320173056_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;oh=dac42a0ef71a2fd5ba08576374912e6d&amp;oe=5B74CB7A) [in these images](https://www.facebook.com/bangtan.official/photos/pcb.2092648734083711/2092646807417237/?type=3&amp;theater).

**How do I buy my fan club membership?**

It's like buying a ticket. You do it through the Interpark account you already created. When they begin selling memberships, BigHit will promote the links to the membership. You can also go to the [Korean Interpark site](http://ticket.interpark.com/Global/) and search for BTS and it will come up. Interpark has an English display option (top right of the site) so just follow instructions to enter your information and buy the membership. Make sure you have pop-ups enabled for the site. If you have a pop-up blocker it might interfere. 

I may update this post with a more detailed tutorial with screenshots once the recruitment is open, but for now, I can't show you what the screens actually look like. But if everything should be really straightforward. 

-----------------------------------------

##Entering fan cafe and other information AFTER YOU BUY YOUR FAN CLUB MEMBERSHIP##
This is an important step a lot of people forget about. Once you've purchased your fan club membership, you need to go back into Interpark and add your fan cafe information to receive the fan cafe benefits. 

**STEP 1:** [Login in to Interpark and click my tickets](https://i.imgur.com/L6bpCqJ.jpg). 

**STEP 2:** You will [your order listed with a confirmation number](https://i.imgur.com/L6bpCqJ.jpg). Click the confirmation number.

**STEP 3:** Click [""Enter Your Detail""](https://i.imgur.com/5ZIL3EZ.jpg)

**STEP 4:** Click [""Enter / Modify Your Detail""](https://i.imgur.com/5ZIL3EZ.jpg)

**STEP 5:** [Fill out your information](https://i.imgur.com/WBCoZAQ.jpg). This screenshot is from last year, and they asked for:

* Your full, REAL name that matches your passport. This will be printed on your fan club card.
* Your birthday in YYMMDD format. This will be printed on your fan club card.
* Your Daum Account ID. The screen shot/ box says official fan cafe ID, which might confuse people, but it's your Daum Account ID.
* Your BTS Shop ID. (They didn't mention shop benefits in the recruitment images this year, so it might not be there)

------------------

And that's it! Again, I recommend you [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7q6y52/bts_army_official_fan_club_information_faq/) for more general information and discussions on the fan club membership itself and whether it's worth it. 

Good luck!

&gt;Your soul is a landscape fair and fine
&gt;Where charming masqueraders swarm
&gt;Playing the lute and dancing and almost
&gt;Sad beneath their fanciful costumes.

&gt;Singing together in a minor key
&gt;Of love conquests and the life of risks,
&gt;They do not seem to believe in their happiness
&gt;And their song mingles with the moonlight

&gt;The quiet moonlight, sad and beautiful,
&gt;That lulls the birds in the trees to dream
&gt;And makes the fountain jets sob in ecstasy,
&gt;The tall slender jets among marble statues.


Reading it again, I think it ties in beautifully with the whole LY concept, even if BH is not aware of it (somehow I'm sure they are...)

The poem starts out with a masked ball under the moonlight, everyone is seemingly having fun and partying. And yet it seems like they're putting on a show, and that this happiness is not genuine. They are concealing their sadness under a mask, it's all a pretense. 

As the poem continues, the masks are lifted, the soul is left to himself, the party scene is gone, everything is silent. It is left to confront its innermost feelings, and its melancholy is reflected by the cold surroundings. There is also a sense of peace and harmony, the soul is at last free of superficial pretenses, the moonlight illuminating its true sadness. 

This reads like the 19th century poem version of Outro:Her and its unborn sequel. Anyways I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere so I thought I would share!

Back in November during when Love Yourself came out, and properly one of my fave eras (from listening 3 years now?) I was immediately drawn and fell in love with the tracks, the art of it and never felt so attached before, I always wanted my first tattoo and I thought why not do it something that has a huge place in my heart. So I got this done back in November and I was nervous as heck and didn't expect my first tattoo to be my entire forearm. But to this day and I don't think ever will I regret it. I never really been involved with ARMY though I love talking about BTS and to few of my co workers who luckily listen to them! (New Zealand up in here! )

I only just posted it for the first time online mainly due to the fact I would hear mixed reactions inking something onto my skin that left me worried but now idc lol, and I was curious if any of you guys got tattoos in dedication of bts? I know im not the only one and would love to see the work/pieces! OR! if you guys ever had any thoughts or consideration of getting one! I know this is properly not my last tattoo to do with BTS but I would love to hear what you guys have to say! (Her was personally my fave track from album as it had a hint of lofi hiphop that I could downright chill too oml)

What are the saddest BTS songs for you? I've been rotating a ""feels BTS playlist"" hard for the last couple of days, and here are a couple of things in it:

**First Love** - Oh god, Suga's rapping here is so deep. The lyrics for this are some of the best for any Bangtan solo song - talking directly about his passion and love for music/piano, and showing off his depth as an artist in the process. And I swear whenever he says ""piano"" a hair on my neck just raises up.

**Butterfly (Prologue Mix)** - Butterfly is a sad song in general (it's about someone disappearing from your life) but the prologue mix just cranks it up to 11. 

**Love Is Not Over** - Soulful, soul-baring piano ballad, then when the production kicks in it turns into a soulful R&amp;B jam about loving even though someone leaves. Oof.

**Run** - Probably the most underrated BTS ""feels"" track around. Something about Run - its intensity, its instrumentation, and the strings at the beginning - just gets to me every time I hear it. Really though, the lyrics. It's about chasing desperately after someone you know you're never going to have, even if it costs you everything and you know it's never going to happen. I've been in this place so many times. Running and running towards a love that's never going to be mine. Probably why it's my favorite BTS song in general - just fuck me up with that Bangtan unrequited love anthem fam.

Also, holy shit this line from J-Hope's verse is killer: *I cant tell whether it is sweat or tears*",108,216,False,self,,,,,

As our boys korean comeback is approaching and possibility for their new own music show like previous comeback show and BTS countdown, I am quite worry that we may stumble a bit in helping promoting our boys to promote their live performances to youtubers as for recent copyright strikes. 

As far as I know copyright strikes are from CJ&amp;EM that own mnet that host music show like mcountdown and also our boys previous own shows like comeback show and BTS countdown. And compare to other music shows, mcountdown is the one that always has best camera work and performances with highest views. 

So, I am thinking that can we use live performances from other music shows like Music Core, Music Bank, Show Champion, etc to promote our boys for letting youtubers reacting to it? I think youtube reactions really important to promote our boys. Bang PD even acknowledging the power of youtubers reaction especially during dope song. Plus, our boys are really great performers and it such upsetting for what happened with recent copyright strikes.

Thus, what you guys thinking about it? I think it is really crucial thing in helping our boys' music getting more wide spread through social media. Live performances are really among main reason to attract non kpop fans/non fans. First impression is really important and our boys are really great performer so I feel quite sad if youtubers dont know about it.",43,62,False,self,,,,,

Where I live, the ""cut off"" date for the academic year is October 1st, so if you're born after that, you get pushed to the next school year! In this system, Jin and Suga would have been in the same grade (Jin being old-ish for his grade and Suga being average). J-Hope and RM would be the year after them. However, some states have the cut off date sooner (like August 31st), so RM wouldn't have been in the same grade as J-Hope! Then the grade under that wouldn't have any BTS members because V and Jimin would need to go to school with the kids born in '96 since their birthdays are so late. Jungkook would be young for his grade :) but again in other states, he could be pushed to the next year and be old for his grade.

We are One In An ARMY!

We are just coming to give you all a follow-up post to our first one explaining the project to let you know that the first campaign has officially launched! Please see here for details: https://twitter.com/OneInAnArmy/status/982996662141575169

Our first project is in providing aid to Syrian refugees in the form of medical supplies and medical training for people who have been left without access. We have partnered with a really great organization called Medical Teams International, who were really excited about the project and have been really accommodating in allowing us to test run the model we proposed to ARMY with their program [See here for the previous post outlining the model](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/88i0nk/one_in_an_army_global_bts_army_charity_campaign/). They made an effort to lower their minimum donations to accommodate microdonations, tweaked their system to allow for global currencies, and set us up with a landing page for easy tracking.  They will be providing feedback at the end of the campaign (at the end of the month) so that we can know exactly what ARMY's donations have been able to provide. They have also agreed to send the thank-you to Big Hit on behalf of ARMY worldwide.

We launched the project at midnight KST, April 9 (so... yesterday). And... the feedback on Twitter has been amazing. We've got a team of translators who translate the posters into many different languages, and several fanbases on board who let ARMY in their countries know what's going on. We are still in need of people who can communicate with the Korean and Japanese fanbases, as those have been the difficult ones to get translators for. We do have translators now, but making the K/J-ARMYs aware of the project is still a challenge we're working on! So... if you know anyone who'd like to assist with that, hit us up!

That being said, we really want to thank the support we got here in r/Bangtan, and we hope you will continue to support this project in the future. Looking at our twitter feed right now, we are currently seeing something really really cool happening and we are so proud and humbled and honored to be a part of such an amazing famdom with amazing hearts, and we know that a family this size, with these good intentions, can really make a difference for people.

I encourage you to follow our Twitter account, @OneInAnARMY, and check out our [website](https://oneinanarmy.wixsite.com/home). And please take a moment to see this short video that the youngest member of our team put together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K0j0qYxDW0

We all talk about how creative and inventive Big Hit and BTS are for creating Bangtan Universe, worlds that relate, symbolize or bring the stories of people BTS wants to talk about to life.

My question is: what are some of the themes, lessons, and stories brought to life by HYYH and the BU?

For instance:

* It talks being young, reckless, and immature (the Run MV comes to mind).

* It talks about depression and tendencies to be suicidal (Hobi's pill-popping, JK, Suga and Tae's actions come to mind).

* It talks about mental illnesses (Jimin and Hobi come to mind).

* It talks about friendship (the entire universe is some 0T7 fanfiction, no lie. It allows people who have similar friendships to be nostalgic and makes those who don't have it envious as heck lol).

* It talks about abuse and some consequences of that (Tae killing his dad).

* It talks about being there for your friends and family.

* It talks about love.

Ive been a fan of BTS for almost two years now, and although Im still kinda? a newbie, Ive consumed a lot of their content, like their Gayos and Run episodes. I have to say as much as I like how cute and fun the Gayo/Run episodes are produced, Im really happy Burn the Stage was created the way it was.

I know that the purposes of the Run and Gayo episodes are very different from the purpose of the documentary, so obviously there are different styles of editing theyre gonna use to get their point across, but still! I notice how theres no constant background music or noise. You just hear the members voiceovers as other scenes play. The colors are really nice, and any background music really fits the feeling of every scene. The one-on-one interviews are insightful, and the fact that theres no constant pop-ups of writing on the screen as things are happening really allows you to focus on BTS and what theyre saying. I dont have anything against the little writing tidbits and captions their editors put on their media, but as an English-speaking fan, it makes things a little tough to follow when its usually written in Korean and youre trying to read the subtitles at the same time.

Overall, Im really happy that the editing and cinematography of Burn the Stage allows them to be serious and also have fun. I remember in the first episode, Namjoon? (I cant remember who exactly it was) said that if they were to watch the documentary later on in life, they would cry. I think the editing has a lot to do with that. Ive only been a fan for two years, but the way Burn the Stage is produced makes me feel like its been so much longer. Theres definitely a nostalgic and reminiscent feeling whenever theyre talking or doing anything really. It feels like youre watching just a couple of really good friends be really good friends, in a way, I guess.

Anyways, what are your thoughts? Any highlights or critiques about the way Burn the Stage was made? Do you like how its produced? Why or why not?",59,152,False,self,,,,,

The article talks about how 'the wind of Hallyu is blowing again' overcoming 'the order of restriction on Hallyu' (China) and 'anti-Korean sentiment' (Japan). In the last two paragraphs, translated below, the new Hallyu led by BTS is talked about. They call it 'Hip Hallyu' (cheezy I know). Although I usually don't appreciate the focus being on the use of social media, I guess we can't deny that social media did play a huge role (a good example of necessary but not sufficient conditions).  

&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Japan: 'Hip Hallyu' spreads via YouTube**

In Japan, Hallyu is reviving through YouTube and social media. TWICE, in particular, gained a huge popularity through this channel. Since their debut in October, 2015, all of their released songs surpassed 100M views on YouTube. The influence of BTS, who was the only foreign singer to achieve 'double platinum (500K album sales)' last year, is significant. BTS is receiving high praise that they have opened up a new horizon of Hallyu not only in Japan but also in the US and Europe. 

The Korea Creative Content Agency also chose 'Hip Hallyu' that BTS showed as the '2018 contents trend outlook.' 'Hip Hallyu' is a term that combines 'hip', which is about vivid characteristics and pursuing of the new, and 'Hallyu'. It's not about blindly doing performances and fanmeets, but about strongly expressing the characteristics of individual members and of the whole group using YouTube and social media. Recently a lot of idol groups who have overseas expansion in mind are adopting this strategy following the example of BTS. Kwon Oh-tae, the head of External Affairs department of the Korea Creative Content Agency, added ""there will be a movement to expand over to foreign countries in a more delicate and diversified way on top of utilizing YouTube or social media like BTS.""",26,112,False,self,,,,,

Although we have a while to go before the comeback, I wanted to write up this guide to help educate anyone who would like to actively help BTS make history by setting even more Billboard records during their comeback.  There is a lot of misinformation floating around, so I hope this will be useful for confused new fans, casual fans, and those that try to avoid the drama of stan twitter at all costs. But this can also be a great refresher for experienced ARMYs as well (if you find any mistakes please let me know thanks). Lets get started!

---

##**GOALS**

&gt; ***I hope (with our next album) we can reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and the top 10 on Hot 100 chart.*  [Jimin](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/12/10/0200000000AEN20171210003200315.html)**

###Chart #1 on Billboard 200
* The Billboard 200 is a record chart for albums and EPs published weekly based on multi-metric sales (physical, digital, streaming) in the United States only.

* Based on the performance of Face Yourself and [Love Yourself:Her](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DadoenQUMAIAKZS.jpg:orig), this goal is achievable assuming the album release does not coincide with any A-list western artists and the album pre-orders are actually shipped on time (prayer circle for Amazon to deliver).

###Chart Top 10 on Hot 100
* The Hot 100 is a record chart for singles published weekly based on sales, radio play, and streaming in the United States only.

* Lower your expectations, this will be considerably more challenging with an album release unless BTS unexpectedly debuts the lead single in a performance at the BBMAs and we get support from the general public. Michael Buble has six platinum albums but his biggest single Havent Met You Yet peaked at #24 on the Hot 100. Yes, that song you heard everywhere in 2010.

* Mic Drop Remix debuted at #28 because as a single, ARMYs and casual fans had no other option (aka a physical album) to purchase and listen to the track legally. Many casual BTS fans will buy the new physical album without also purchasing the lead single digitally.

---

##**GENERAL INFO**

Billboards tracking week for sales and streams starts on Friday and ends on Thursday. If BTS releases their album on Monday to better accommodate Korean charts, this means we will only have 3-4 days to chart instead of a full week like competing western artists. Actively remind any casual fans you know when the MV and album drops.

Billboards tracking week for radio plays starts on Monday and ends on Sunday. So we should be fine here assuming the track is well received by radio stations that have played DNA and MDR before. But radio requests are crucial in the first week to ensure as high of a debut as possible.

[Album-equivalent units]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/US_album_equivalent_unit.png/816px-US_album_equivalent_unit.png) are measurement units used to define the consumption of music that equals the purchase of one album copy.

###Physical Album Sales

* **Amazon**:  Only buy physical copies on Amazon from the preorder links that [@bts_bighit]( https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/908642443658018816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fbangtan%2Fcomments%2F6w02h9%2Fhow_to_help_bts_during_comeback_time_a_megaguide%2F&amp;tfw_site=reddit) provides. You can only buy 5 or fewer albums from Amazon on the same account for the sales to count towards Billboard 200. It doesnt matter whether you buy them all at once or over several days. If you want to buy more than 5 copies using another Amazon account, use a different device/IP to be safe.

* **Retail**:  Hopefully the album will stocked be in stores like Target and Walmart on release day. Again, you can only buy 5 or fewer albums on one receipt for the sales to count towards Billboard 200. Nielsen counts scans of separate barcodes as sales, so you do not need to worry about buying each album on a separate receipt. 

###Digital Song Sales

####Track Equivalent Albums (TEA):  10 digital song sales = 1 album sale

* If you want to take advantage of TEA to contribute to both Hot 100 and Billboard 200 at the same time, manually buy each individual track on iTunes. Do NOT press Complete My Album. *This is probably the most efficient way to help BTS chart in terms of dollars spent relative to impact on the charts.* If enough people buy each track individually using this method, multiple tracks could chart on Hot 100. Bonus points if you Venmo your friend money to buy individual tracks with their iTunes account to get more of that sweet TEA.

* Gifting digital songs on iTunes does NOT count towards Billboard charts. However, it WILL help increase the lead singles ranking on iTunes charts. Twitter ARMYs are trying to get the lead single to rank #1 on iTunes in 100 countries. If you live in one of the countries where BTS did not chart at #1 on iTunes for either LY:H, MDR, or FY it might still be worthwhile to gift on iTunes.

###Streaming

####Streaming Equivalent Albums (SEA):  150 streams = 1 digital song sale, so 1500 streams = 1 album sale

* Our streaming numbers are weak and extremely inconsistent. See [this]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaYjdXUU8AAIn9_.jpg) Hot 100 debut comparison of Mic Drop Remix to other western artists. And [here]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaTus8vVAAAz-ms.jpg) is our streaming performance for MDR over its 10 week Hot 100 charting period.

* Camila Cabellos Havana debuted at #94 on the Hot 100. With steadily increasing radio play and streams, it finally reached #1 on the Hot 100 over 5 months (23 weeks) later. We are at an inherent disadvantage due to the mismatch between K-Pop and American promotion styles. But we need to try to maintain stronger and more consistent streaming numbers to climb to the top 10. 

* Our main problem is that our sales and streaming are heavily front-loaded, while radio plays only build after radio stations see the results on the Billboard charts from these efforts (and Shazams). This is why it is crucial that we maintain steady sales and streaming. If the single charts well, it will increase in radio play. If the general public hears the song on the radio and likes it, they will also buy and stream the song, pushing it higher on the Billboard charts, and this again increases radio play. It is a self-perpetuating cycle that we need to try to kick-start.

##**BILLBOARD 200**

###How can I help BTS chart #1 on the BB 200 if I live in the U.S.?

* Please refer to the Physical Album Sales, Digital Song Sales, and Streaming sections above if you skipped it. Depending on how much money you have, spend it on any combination of physical album purchases, TEA, and SEA to contribute to Billboard 200 album sales. But if you do not care about collecting physical albums, *TEA is the most efficient way to contribute to both Billboard 200 and Hot 100*.

* If you want to use SEA to contribute, [here](https://i.imgur.com/d3CSHBq.jpg) is a list of all of the streaming services that count towards Billboard 200. Continue to the Hot 100 section below to learn how to stream on Spotify and Apple Music.

###How can I help BTS chart #1 on the BB 200 if I do not live in the U.S.?

* Obviously, you cant buy physical albums or TEA since you arent in the U.S. You can, however, contribute to U.S. sales by donating to @BTSonHot100 [here]( https://www.btsxusa.com/donate). This a trusted fanbase has gathered funds and provided receipts for [Mic Drop]( https://twitter.com/BTSonHot100/status/960546749352894464) and [Daydream](https://twitter.com/BTSonHot100/status/969451905557647360).

* Do ***NOT*** use a VPN with Spotify or any other streaming service to contribute to SEA. Skip to the Hot 100 section below for more details.

* If you live in a [bigger music market]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_music_industry_market_share_data#IFPI_2016_data) like the U.K., Germany, France, or Canada, you might want to contribute to your own countrys album charts instead.

##**HOT 100**

###How can I help BTS chart top 10 on the Hot 100 if I live in the U.S.?

**SALES (35-45%)**

* Buy the lead single on a digital platform of your choice.

* To contribute further, utilize TEA on the single ONLY to efficiently help BTS climb both Hot 100 and Billboard 200. So you should purchase the same digital single on multiple platforms like iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play. Again, you can strongly persuade friends and family to use their accounts to download the single. If you have more money than friends, donate to @BTSonHot100 [here]( https://www.btsxusa.com/donate).

* Remember, 10 song downloads = 1 album sale. You can also go above and beyond and create 10 different iTunes accounts to buy the lead single on each. This will contribute 10 units to the Hot 100 and 1 unit to the Billboard 200. Do not attempt to purchase more than 3 of the same song per day, per device/IP.

**RADIO (30-40%)**

* Click on the heart to request BTS singles on [Radio Disney]( http://radio.disney.com/top-songs) with multiple devices.

* Shazam is a mobile app that identifies the songs it hears. The app sends data to radio stations for them to determine a song's popularity in the state/local areas. Please read [this guide]( https://www.btsxusa.com/shazam) to learn how to use it on your mobile device.

* Most Requested Live is a syndicated show which plays the top requested song every hour on Saturdays from 7PM to 11PM EST. Request through calls, texts, and social media platforms. Why is it important? Being the most requested song of the hour plays BTS single on 170+ stations across U.S. and Canada, which helps boost radio plays significantly. Please read [this guide]( https://www.btsxusa.com/most-requested-live) to learn how to help.

**STREAMING (20-30%)**

* Stream the single on repeat, bonus points if you leave it running on your streaming device overnight. 

Spotify

* Stream from any popular playlists (such as Todays Top Hits or New Music Friday) the song is added to. The more we stream the song from the popular playlist, the higher the song is pushed to the top, which allows better exposure to the general public.

* Sharing the single to social media platforms will help the song enter the Global and/or U.S Viral 50 Spotify playlists for further exposure.

* Spotify is the only streaming service where offline streams count, and will update when you reconnect to the internet.

Apple Music

* Apple Music will automatically stream any iTunes purchases you have already made, so make sure that you are streaming online and not from the downloaded song.

* After your purchase of a single or album, manually search the song and check that you have removed the downloaded track from your phone, and stream from there.

YouTube

* Stream the official MV on the ibighit channel (obviously).

* Theres a lot of dos and donts for Youtube streaming and no one knows for sure if all of these steps are necessary, so follow [these steps](https://i.imgur.com/EMRjuUu.jpg) from btsxusa if you have extraordinary time, patience, and dedication.

* Please try not to watch any lyric videos or reaction videos from popular channels in the first 24 hours to avoid pushing them above the actual MV in YouTube search results. Instead, look for the great written translations that will be provided here on /r/Bangtan!

* Twitter ARMYs are aiming very high with 24-hour views this comeback. The unofficial goal among many big accounts is 50 million views in 24 hours to try and surpass Taylor Swifts record.

Note:

* Plays on paid subscription-based services (Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal) or on paid subscription tiers of hybrid paid/ad-supported platforms (Spotify Premium) are given more weight in chart calculations than plays on pure ad-supported services (YouTube) or on the non-paid tiers of hybrid paid/ad-supported services (Spotify Free).

* Therefore, *paid streams are highly preferred*. ARMYs that stream on free services will need to work 2 or 3 times harder to contribute the same amount as those that stream using paid services. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/cTkRGsa.jpg) is a list of all of the streaming services that count towards Hot 100.

###How can I help BTS chart top 10 on the Hot 100 if I do not live in the U.S.?

**SALES (35-45%)**

* Again, you can contribute to U.S. sales of the new single, album, and U.S. premium streaming accounts by donating to @BTSonHot100 [here]( https://www.btsxusa.com/donate).

* However, [this]( https://twitter.com/KARMYxIARMY/status/982899685063970816) account will also be distributing U.S.-made Spotify accounts to non-U.S. ARMYs for free streaming. Not exactly sure how it works, but many U.S. ARMYs have already signed up to help make U.S. Spotify accounts and non-U.S. ARMYs to use them. 

**RADIO (30-40%)**

* Click on the heart to request BTS singles at [Radio Disney]( http://radio.disney.com/top-songs) on multiple devices.

* No matter your location, increasing Shazam numbers means increasing interest from radio stations. Please read [this guide]( https://www.btsxusa.com/shazam) to learn how to use it on your mobile device.

* Help make requests for Most Requested Live through social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). Please read [this guide]( https://www.btsxusa.com/most-requested-live) to learn how to help.

**STREAMING (20-30%)**

* Do ***NOT*** use a VPN to stream for Hot 100. Billboard/Nielsen/Spotify have confirmed that they have mechanisms in place to protect against this type of activity. In other words, your streams will be filtered out and media outlets may find out and write shady articles about us and BTS. See [this](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15533760/harry-styles-streaming-data-billboard-tumblr-fan-effort) write up by The Verge on how Harry Styles fans tried to use VPNs.

---

##**KEEP IN MIND**

* Dont feel bad if you can only do one thing on this list. Every bit helps! If you work long hours it is probably better for you to buy physical albums or digital downloads rather than spend time streaming.  And if you are a student with less money and more time you can help us with free streaming, Shazams, or radio requests.

* Dont be disappointed if we fail to achieve either goal. We are competing with some of the most popular western artists, and we will have more chances with the following album and new collab singles like MDR that are released with the U.S. market in mind.

* I wrote this for ARMYs here that do not have the time commitment to go above and beyond in terms of streaming, radio requests, and social media promotion like stan Twitter. If you are a more dedicated ARMY, read through www.btsxusa.com to learn how to contribute further, they have a great website.

* Lets enjoy new Bangtan music and work hard together to try to achieve the goals that Jimin challenged us with!

**Disclaimer**

* I am by no means an expert, I just spent a few hours compiling information from various sources scattered across Twitter, /r/bangtan, and the internet so please let me know if you find any missing or inaccurate information.  I tried to keep this as short and simple as possible, but obviously I failed   if you read this entire essay I am seriously impressed. Thank you for attending my Ted Talk!

BTS the new business textbook of the Millennial generation",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8ck8pq/180401_autonomy_stability_rolebased_leadership/,diminie,1523845065,"Source: http://dbr.donga.com/article/view/1203/article_no/8590

April 1st issue of DBR (DongA Business Review), which is a business&amp;economy magazine that introduces success/failure stories from Korea/abroad and examines the reasons behind, covered the story of BTS. You can think of it as a Korean version of HBR (Harvard Business Review). The article is written by a professional consultant. 

&amp;nbsp;

The article categorizes how BTS is different from other idols into four:

* Shared vision &amp; maximum autonomy (compared case: Netflix)

* Psychological stability that encourages risk-taking (compared case: Google)

* Role-based leadership (compared case: Zappos)

* Role of the management for Millennials

&amp;nbsp;

'Article at a glance' and the first paragraph of 'Role-based leadership' are translated below.

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Article at a Glance**

BTS, who came from a non-major agency, has become the hottest artist in the global market, passing the boundary of Korean market, in only 4 years since debut. Analyzing the success recipe of BTS, we can learn that they have well-identified the characteristics of the Millennial generation who are arising as the core body of consumption and management. BTS started communicating with their fans via social media before debut. They also wrote the lyrics that reflect the concern of Millennials by themselves, earning the heart of their fans. They maximized their teamwork by, for each member, assigning a clear a role and having him show a role-based leadership. These features appealed to Millennials, making an voluntary and horizontal fandom all over the world.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Role-based leadership**

BTS has seven members. Rap Monster (RM; 94), who is the third oldest, is the leader of BTS. Sometimes he is strict, but sometimes he puts himself down and clowns around to demonstrate a horizontal leadership. But its not that RM alone is getting the spotlight. Each of the seven members serve a leading role that fits his own characteristics, and they create role-based leadership that is differentiated across members. When it comes to producing, Suga (93) and RM are the ones who play a leading role, and J-Hope (94) serves as the leader in performance and choreography. In actual performances, the maknae line, Jimin (95), V (95), and Jungkook (97), serves a leading role in the front. The maknae line also plays most energetic and fun roles in their self-produced videos that are posted on social media, creating the sense of connection with their fans. Jin (92), the oldest, plays a big role to create a horizontal culture in the entire group by conducting himself without constraint with the younger members. All the members try to utilize each members personality and capability by maximizing their strength, rather than minimizing their weakness. In fact, their popularity is not skewed to specific members but is evenly distributed. They are one team, but each member lets his own color shine through. ",15,184,False,self,,,,,

It turns out the express return shipping is nearly the same price as the refund so I've decided not to bother and to just give them to some ARMY on here instead! 

[CHIMCHIIIIIM](https://imgur.com/a/FcedK)


I can ship these from Ireland to almost anywhere in the world (Libya and Yemen are the only countries my local post office has said they can't ship to). The slippers are FREE, you just need to pay for the postage so I'm not further out of pocket. Paypal would be ideal.


 If you want to find out the shipping price to your country first, I can get a quote from the post office and let you know but they're pretty lightweight so I think they'd be fairly cheap to send anywhere it just depends on what degree of tracking you'd want. 


Also for reference, a US size 7 is I reckon about a 38 or 39 in European sizes. I'm a 40 (UK 6.5) and they were just a bit too small. #fail


Hope they can find a good home :D And sorry if I've made any mistake with the title or posting guidelines.

I found interesting tweet telling that 18 may actually is the same day for Gwangju Uprising (https://twitter.com/BTS_ARMY_INT/status/985902975762780160?s=19). Which actually a mass protest in Korea 1980 against the military government. 

18 also means humanitarianism which is belief in the value of human life could link to ""human control system"" which BTS actually teased us since MAMA. 
https://twitter.com/ilsansqueen/status/985920066817409025?s=19

Tear also may not mean to ""crying"" and it may about ""tear apart"" that relate really well with all glitch theory. 

As euphoria also done by jungkook and serendipity by jimin, the one who left are V and Jin. I have a feeling its gonna be V co he fit the theme.

So, what you guys think about the comeback theory for love yourself: tear? I bet this comeback this time gonna be way more massive than last year love yourself: her.

*Last updated 4/17/18*  

***

Hi, in order to stop all the small where do I buy ___? How do I do ___? newbie first-timer questions, I have decided to start writing this guide to help out all the new fans!  

If you have any extra resources, guides, or updates to include in this, please let me know in the comments and Ill update it! Some of these you don't even need money to help with!  


##What can I do before May 18?  

***

###Buy/Preorder the physical album  

**BASIC PHYSICAL ALBUM INFO**  

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8cthla/180417_love_yourself_%E8%BD%89_tear_preorder_information/) is the list of everything included when you purchase the physical album. Ill break it down for newbies, as some of the things listed arent super obvious:  

* 1 CD (self-explanatory)  
* 4 Versions: Y, O, U, R. This means that each version will have a different cover and a different set of photos inside, usually. (We dont know what photos will be in what, or what the covers will look like until Big Hit releases that information later on).
* Big Hit states that you can either purchase 1 random copy (meaning you cant choose what version you will get; its just randomized), or the set of all 4 albums. However, some sites that arent the official store will allow you to choose your version (we will have more info on which ones specifically later).  
* Photo book (4 versions): a glossy, literal 104 page book of photos of the BTS members within the album that has 4 versions (Y, O, U, R). Each version is located inside the corresponding album. Meaning, there is a Y photobook in the Y album, O in the O, etc.  
* Mini Book (HYYH the notes): will contain extra tidbits about the HYYH storyline, and will most likely be entirely in Korean (so it probably wont matter for most of us lol). 
* Cutout: This is just a cute little thing that will stand on your desk, haha. Like [this](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/152436717910-0-1/s-l1000.jpg) standee from YNWA pre-orders.  
* Photocard: Collectable card of one of the members. Each version of the album will have its own photocard of each member. You will only get one of these within each album you purchase. (If you purchase the set of 4, you will get 4 photocards; one in each album).
* Special photocard: Only 1 version of these (instead of the 4); but they will only be in the pre-order of the album (initial sale). **If you purchase the album after the pre-sale period has ended, you dont get this photocard.**  
* Poster (4 Versions): Each poster will be correlated with the versions of the album. I.e. there is a specific poster that goes with all Y versions, one with all O versions, etc. These are also only going to come with the album during the pre-sale period. 

###Purchasing the Physical album

[Here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DH8RFpkWAAI4Onz.jpg) is a nifty infographic of reliable online stores to preorder the album from. **IF** you are from the US/Canada please look at the info below:  

**IF YOU ARE FROM THE US/CANADA:**  

You will likely be able to buy from Amazon! We just need to wait for Big Hit to send out the **OFFICIAL** Amazon link first to avoid any scams; likely they will announce it through Twitter (keep an eye on the bts_official account). It will go towards BOTH Korean and American/Canadian charts! *Definitely* order from here if you can. But do NOT buy from ANY other link/seller on Amazon; they are NOT official and won't go towards either chart. ONLY the link in the tweet is official. [Here's more charting info about buying from Amazon](https://twitter.com/BTS_Billboard/status/903391999444865024).  

**Etc.**

You can also join a GO (Group Order) for lower shipping costs, however these *can* be less trustworthy than buying it yourself from a shop. Often times it is 100% safe and cheaper though! If anyone has a list of Group Orders for different countries, feel free to tell me in the comments and Ill add it~   

Other tips: Buying it with a poster gives you the choice of folded/unfolded. Folded means the poster will have crease marks in it, and unfolded means it will come in a tube (no fold marks)!  

You dont need to rush to pre-order, they will not run out.

###International Fanprojects  

***

* [@BTS_Billboard](https://twitter.com/BTS_Billboard) will likely do another fanproject. Last comeback, they did the [Strong Power, Thank You Project](https://twitter.com/BTS_Billboard/status/901635732690882560), but since we found out that gifted songs dont count towards the Hot 100 anymore, they will likely do another project! If they dont, the account is still good to follow for tips, tricks, and updates about BTS on the Billboard charts.  

I dont know of any others at the moment, but please let me know if you see any good ones!

###Melon Passes  

***

Buy a Melon pass to help BTS on Korean charts!  

**Note:** I personally dont think this is necessary to do anymore anymore. I believe I-ARMYs should focus on their personal countries, as K-ARMYs are strong enough and BTS has enough GP recognition to do well on the Korean charts no matter what :) Ill leave the info here for anyone who really wants to, but I definitely dont think its necessary.  

Before you do that, you need to [make a MelOn Account.](http://dailynamjoon.blogspot.com/2016/09/how-to-create-melon-account-step-by.html) &lt;- this guide is outdated, but mostly correct, however you will need a KakaoTalk account to sign up now. If you find an updated version lmk...  

After doing that, you will need to buy a MelOn pass. You cant easily do this from outside of Korea, so you will need to wait for someone to do a group MelOn pass purchase. If someone knows of a group order list, lmk.

[Here is a guide](https://bangtanintl.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/tutorial-how-to-stream-songs-on-melon-app/) for how to make sure your stream counts on MelOn. K-ARMYs have a specific playlist for streaming, which you can find when its closer to comeback (Ill link).  


##Hot 100 Preparation  

***

###Hot 100 Breakdown by % (though it varies a LOT, read more [here](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/ask-billboard/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work)):  

* Sales: 35-45%
* Airplay: 30-40%
* Streaming: 20-30%  

10 downloaded tracks = 1 album, and 1,500 plays on Spotify, Rhapsody, Tidal, Rdio, Beats, Google Play, Apple Music, Amazon Prime, Pandora and others = 1 album. 

* ***Note*: All of the following will only work if you are in the USA!**  
- *Side-note: you CAN use VPN to do all of this and have it count towards the US charts from outside of the States, but I personally think, to avoid charges of chart manipulation, and because I truly believe there are enough dedicated and casual US ARMY to have BTS chart without any funny business, I personally advise against using VPN. Help BTS chart in as many countries as possible! Send them to the top of your countrys chart, even if its a nugu country. Show off your national and BTS pride at the same time :P*  
  
Basically, the main apps/things you will need to know how to use are:  

* **iTunes/Google Play/Amazon Prime/Tidal/Rhapsody**  
-Purchase the album/single from as many of these sites as possible (if you can). iTunes is the **MOST** important one to buy from though! I have listed them above in order of their market share (i.e. how much it matters. Basically iTunes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all though, lmao. Make sure your iTunes acct is located to the USA if youre in the US in order for it to count towards Hot 100!)  
* **Spotify**  
-YOU CAN STREAM ON SPOTIFY FOR **FREE**!! I repeat, Spotify is free to download/listen, youll just have to listen to ads every so often. Its best to focus on streaming just the title track. [Here's a guide for streaming on Spotify~](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4M2D5CUEAE5n_b.jpg). Make sure the region in your profile is set to USA (go to profile &gt; edit &gt; country to set this up). You can use Spotify on your phone if you sign up for the free 30-day premium trial as well! Streams from premium accounts do count more than streams from free accounts, iirc, but both do help!!  
-Important: If you dont have Spotify in your country, sign up [**HERE**](https://twitter.com/hassanoualy/status/985934608133959680) to show that theres demand for it in your country!  
* **Apple Music**  
-You can sign up for a 3-month free trial on Apple Music if you havent already used it! Spotify is more important than Apple Music in terms of market share though, so concentrate on that one if you can. Either one is still helpful though! :)  
* **Shazam**  
-This is **INCREDIBLY** important for potential radio play, guide to Shazam [here](https://twitter.com/BTSRequest/status/896895256959926272). Follow [this](https://twitter.com/BTSonShazam) twitter account for tons of tips/tricks/updates on Shazam!  
* **Pandora**  
-I dont really know much about Pandora, but they recently added it as counting towards the Hot 100 as well. So do that too if you can!

____________________

* **Youtube**   
-Increasing Youtube views also counts towards the Hot100 and album certification only, not the BB200. However, its still important for visibility and the Hot100! [Here are some tips for streaming, all optional.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4M2D_rVUAAsk9_.jpg)  

Some other Youtube Tips (all of these are optional):  

-Doing this on different devices (as in, your phone, tablet, computer, apple watch, your mom's computer, smart TV, any device that can access youtube) will help a LOT! (make sure you aren't logged into the same account on all of them though)  
-Send it to your friends to get their views in too! Share on social media! Every click counts~  
-Try to clear your cookies/youtube watch history every so often. [Heres how](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/95725?hl=en). Alternatively, you can just close and re-open your incognito browser to do the same thing.  

* [This Twitter account](https://twitter.com/BTS_Billboard) and [this account](https://twitter.com/BTSonHot100) give a bunch of updates/ideas for contributing towards Billboard charts, so check it out for more things you can do!  

**RADIO PLAY**

* [@BTSRequest](https://twitter.com/BTSRequest) has tons of resources and will tell everyone when/where to mobilize for radio play and requests when the time comes.
* [@BTSx50States](https://twitter.com/BTSx50States) is specific to USA ARMY, but they also have subdivisions for each region of the US, so that those who actually live in the Southwest, Mid-Atlantic, Texas, etc. can call in to the radio to request! Look for your own regions account to follow [here](https://twitter.com/BTSx50States/status/959217248844918784)!

But I've been realizing more and more what small things did to lead to their success. 

**Two Examples:**

**1:** The existence of rap-line. I think especially for their move to America this really helped. The fact that RM, Suga, and now J-Hope are bonafide rappers really helped gain respect. They also stood out more in the Kpop scene by having such a large rap-line where many groups only have one or maybe two in the lineup. The fact that almost half of BTS (or over half if you count JK lol) are rappers and like *real* rappers (especially Suga and RM but Jhope's mixtape has proved him more than worthy of that title) I think made them feel significantly more authentic and accessible especially to people who value rap as an art form. 

**2:** The fact that they've been releasing pretty full albums (even if they're labeled ""mini"") since debut. They have always had a really full and interesting discography. I know many rookies will release a single and perhaps one b-side + instrumentals. I think it says a lot that BTS' first album had its own hidden track. It feels like they were setting themselves up to be able to do things like concerts from very early on by having a bunch of their own backlogs they could draw from. 

I would love to hear people's thoughts I hope the question made sense. Sorry if it was too similar to previous discussions. ",124,163,False,self,,,,,

I was shocked when I did the math at how old they were at the time. It's about the same as BTS right now - but they look so old to me in those music videos. I guess it just made me realize that I probably infantilize BTS too much because they are 10 years younger than me now and have aged like vampires. I should give them more respect and credit. Also made me realize that they are 100% the best boy band of all time - like what were the deep culture references and storyline behind dirty pop? I never felt the urge to stan any other boy band before.

Until now I have opted to support BTS digitally as I could never rationalise the cost of the alternative but I am beyond determined to finally be able to, quite literally, get my hands on a physical copy this comeback.

I know theres the list of suggested sites for people to buy but just curious if any one has sussed any other alternatives before I trawel through each link and start noting and comparing prices.

I heard ASDA had thought of stocking some kpop albums in the near future but they have gone annoyingly silent on the matter...

So any tips or tricks to not break the bank?

&amp;nbsp;

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Music_Copyright_Association): the KOMCA is a South Korean non-profit copyright collective for musical works, administering public performance and broadcasting rights, and mechanical recording and reproduction rights. Founded in 1964, it is the second collective rights management organization for musical works in Asia, after JASRAC in Japan. It is also one of the largest in Asia, with over 20,000 members. In 2015, it collected 143 billion (US$123 million) in licensing fees and distributed 137 billion (US$118 million) in royalties to its members.

Copyright ownersincluding authors, composers, arrangers, and music publisherscan join KOMCA as associate members. *Associate members who have ""engaged in substantial musical creation"" are promoted to full members by the board of directors.*

[From articles of association](https://www.komca.or.kr/): 25 associate members of the KOMCA are selected each year and appointed as regular members. They have to have been associated with the organization for at least 3 years, and must have earned more than 30M KRW of royalty each year for the past 3 years.

&amp;nbsp;

Just thought I'd compile a list of group orders for the new album for the sake of ease. I'm most familiar with US/CAN group order managers, so if you see someone from your country that you think I should add, please let me know!

In case you aren't familiar with them, group orders are another great way to get your albums. You fill out the order form, and then the group order manager (GOM), buys in bulk to help save on shipping costs. I also personally really like group orders for albums because most GOMs allow the option to choose which photo cards you want, thus saving the trouble of trading them.

/u/heroinasytumbas brought up a really good point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8dsv4k/weekly_rbangtan_room_%EB%B0%A9%ED%83%84%EB%B0%A9_april_21_2018/dxqrnkf/) about Squishy Min Yoongi's [""An Introduction to BTS"" series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DkAZQT8--Nie0m0Ycj8qqpMEa4pomn4). This is by far the most popular introduction series recommended to new fans, especially to reaction channels on YouTube. Although they are fun and easy to watch, the emphasis on inside jokes and ships is less ideal for new fans. Also, there is some [inaccurate](https://youtu.be/hfcmvVDUx1k?t=2m31s) and unnecessary information like astrological signs included. So I thought we could crowdsource some ideas on what should be included in an introduction video to best help new fans learn about each member!

---

First, what is the best video length for an introduction video on each member? It needs to be long enough to provide a comprehensive understanding, but not too long where it loses their attention or overwhelms them.

What information should be included to help new fans learn about the distinct personality and role each member has in the group? Here are some things I think we could start off with:

* Stage name, real name, and all variations of nicknames used by fans (ex. J-Hope, Jung Hoseok, Hobi). Also clips of them pronouncing their names. Let's try to stop the mispronunciation of ""John Cook.""

* Birthday and age ranking in group

* Brief history (predebut clips, audition clips, etc.)

* Official role in group, which official ""lines"" the member is a part of (vocal/rap/dance or maknae/hyung)

* Easiest ways to tell the members apart (visual appearance, vocal tone, unique mannerisms or habits)

* Touching, funny, or stan-attracting clips (*cough* Jimin Perfect Man fancam) to best show the member's personality and talents

---

Once we finalize what should be included, I think I will try to pick out the most upvoted ideas and make another discussion post so everyone can submit the best clips of each member for the finalized ""categories"" of information. Also, /u/flowercastles has generously offered to help edit the videos, but any additional help would be greatly appreciated! I think this is a great project for us to work on now that gifts and books can't be sent to the members, and is really useful in helping the general public understand why we love them so much!",55,129,False,self,,,,,

I've spent the last week or so binging on normal videos e.g. Run! BTS, making of ""MV"", their own little videos etc but I recently found out about most of their music videos occuring in the same universe. 

I've watched the HYYH videos and think I have a grasp on the idea behind it but am unsure of how Fire and  the Japanese versions fit into it. I then tried to move onto the WINGS short films and I can kind of reconcile them with my ideas of HYYH but not very well and I'm especially unsure about the symbolism to do with the quotes from Demian and within the BST mv. I've watched the Love Yourself highlight feel and Euphoria so I can clearly see they're all related but can't figure it out myself.

During one of their songs these foam stars started to float down from the ceiling.

So basically, there has been real historical animosity between Jeolla-do and the rest of South Korea, especially Gyeongsang-do. The citizens of Jeolla-do are still discriminated against, especially by the older generations. And, the Gwangju Uprising hugely contributed to this ongoing discrimination. They were also stereotyped as untrustworthy, mostly by older generations of course. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm really wondering how would BTS tackle this issue. Considering that most of Bangtan is from Gyeongsang-do (Suga, Jimin, V, Jungkook) and only j-hope was from Jeolla-do and Gwangju nonetheless. Keeping in mind that Gyeongsang-do (from what I've read) especially disliked Jeolla-do.  

&amp;nbsp;

Do you have any thoughts about this topic in general? What are your thoughts about the Gwangju Uprising and the discrimination to Jeolla-do?",48,95,False,self,,,,,

However, from what I've observed recently, usually the ones who hype up Bangtan's numbers and whatnot also do *not* fail to emphasize their authenticity and artistry.  And it is my humble opinion that the more efforts we put into charting and whatnot, the more possible it is for the general public to take note of Bangtan - that means their music and messages would have a wider reach.  I mean, in Episode 5 of Burn the Stage, Namjoon said it himself, right?  That he envies the influence the really popular artists have.

I mean, we don't want to force *all* ARMYs to work our butts off in streaming, purchasing, spreading the word and get burnt out eventually, or come across as too obsessive.  We have our own lives, too.  We're kind of labelled as ""trophy-thirsty"" actually by some now, but I'm genuinely hoping for this image to change, though.  Yes, high charts does not immediately equate actual quality music, but with the recognition, wouldn't more and more people get curious enough to check BTS out, and then after hopefully getting exposed to the right ARMY/information, they would come to realize that BTS is worth the hype?

If you guys agree or think otherwise, feel free to comment below though and share your thoughts.  ~~lol i sound like a Youtuber~~",49,70,False,self,,,,,

This issue would have made its rounds on the sub either way (and not wrongly, it is an official statement). 

Some facts: 

- Japan has always been notorious for being strict with their concert venue rules.
- Many fansites who were in Japan recorded on their twitters the mistreatment they said occurred to them and others at the venue. They of course understand that if they're seen to have broken the rules (so, taking any physical record such as photos and videos), they must leave. They're saying what was done to them was worse than this. This is not the first time they have made an issue about such actions, but it is the loudest. 
- There is a great enough trend to believe that many of these statements, though perhaps not all, are true. As a result, many fansites are on rest as a response to the events that have occurred. (Others are simply on rest because it's a quieter time before comeback.) There is also frustration at point 4 from many Korean fans. 
- Many of these claims have been translated (in varying degrees of correctness) into English and other languages. Some twitter accounts have backtracked, but as always, too late. 

More generally, please please, *please* always be wary of lightning speed translations, especially about a contentious issue. The fancafe also has a new auto-translating link, which should not be completely trusted either. Bangladeshi Boy Scouts, we're not fans of you. ",24,168,False,self,,,,,

The only thing is that I literally dont know any fellow BTS fans outside of ze internetz (fml) so going there completely alone is a little bit... daunting. Ive already seen a lot of comments talking about going there and talking about hotels/airbnbs to stay at etc. So I thought, hey, maybe I should start a thread where we all can discuss who is going and where they will stay so people could coordinate a little and then meet up! 

I would love to make this occasion even more special by sharing this moment with fellow ARMYs, especially as there are people like me who havent seen them live before.

(If you want to ensure Im not some random weirdo on the internet, feel free to ask me and I will link/send you whatever social media or information youd want to overview. I dont bite)

[](#jh_glass)

We have a couple things to announce and remind you all, so please make sure to read this post in its entirety.

---

##1. New Moderators

As we mentioned [18 days](https://en.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8ac4bh/180406_now_hiring_moderators_for_rbangtan_new/) ago, we have been looking for moderators to help keep this sub as lovely as it is as it grows (since the current mod team can only do so much on our own). We read through all 23 applications submitted, and decided on 2 candidates who we thought best met what we were looking for.

So, without further ado, please welcome our new /r/bangtan mods:

#[/u/Kelliente and /u/anyone-but-me](https://i.imgur.com/1gpOien.gif)!

Feel free to ask them questions in the comments!

##2. Reminder

Im sure quite a lot you have noticed an increase in new members here. The sidebar doesnt lie and, as of the time this is being posted, we are close to hitting the 25.000 milestone.

The mod team would like to remind you all, old and new, of a few things:

[](#bigbutton) [RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) | [](#bigbutton) [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faq) | [](#bigbutton) [FLAIRS](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/flairs)

More importantly, if you are a newbie, both to the sub and reddit, we ask you to read the following:

Seeing as it is quite hard to discuss possible hotels/airbnbs, seating locations and transportation methods using Reddit, I have done what a few people suggested and opened a Discord!

**The Discord is considered a ""private channel"" just because I don't want random creeps and trolls there when we are going to talk about where we will stay/go etc. All you need to do is send me a message/open the chat here and ask for an invite. I will probably go onto your Reddit profile just to make sure you are an ARMY and not a troll (just to be on the safe side) and then it's all in to discuss in there.**

If you're reading this and are going, ""Hey. I have never used Discord before and I kind of don't know what it is..."" then don't worry! Discord is super simple and super easy. You can log in via the browser but I would suggest downloading it so you can monitor it more easily. You create a username (which can always be changed afterwards) and a password, then ta-dah! You're part of the club.

I'm so excited to be part of all this and meet you guys in Las Vegas. Let's do this!

I want to buy the tickets that are really close to the stage, because I told myself years ago that if I want to go to a BTS concert, I want to go big and see them as close as I could. So I saved over the years and I finally have enough! (I think). However, since our boys have gained so much popularity, the possibility of tickets selling out is very high.

As much as you want. My seller in Korea will try to get everything. If she can not Ill give you a refund.

How do I get updates?
I will be giving updates on items and payments on my Twitter @mochimminy so I do suggest if you order with me to follow my Twitter. This is so you can stay up on all updates of this order

TBD

It was almost like our fandom doubled in size and we were already a big kpop fandom before 2017. So, I was wondering if it's actually possible to top it, can we actually have the same amount of growth in fandom size specifically in 2018 (or maybe even more). Do you think their BBMA performance and LY-Tear can bring that amount of new fan or do we finally reach a plateau? The cynic in me thinks that maybe all the people who would have been open to kpop and BTS have already joined the fandom and the rest remaining people aren't just interested. But the army in me thinks that BTS has always exceeded our expectations and because it's them maybe it's possible. So, what do you think?

Also I know a lot of people think how this census doesn't reflect accurately on fandom because it was restricted to only twitter and only for army who were comfortable in English and I agree but I also think this census still has some credibility given the size of the sample (38,000 something) and the random way we're allowed to participate.",29,112,False,self,,,,,

&amp;nbsp;  

Opening this discussion thread not so much to talk about the plot line or theories related to the BTS fictional storylines. Instead, I'm wondering about the process and background of this narrative. I don't know what's been publicly discussed, but some of things I've been pondering on:  
  
&amp;nbsp;  

* Do we know who came up with these stories to begin with? Do you think this came from BTS themselves, or from the creative and production team around them? And what do you think the original intention was for this narrative?  

* Related to that - thinking about RM's recent comment in Burn the Stage about having to find the time for Namjoon after all he's invested into RM, I wonder what he gets out of introducing yet another character from this narrative into his creative mindset. Maybe this character is a release for him somehow? Allows RM to explore themes that otherwise might not be as personally related to Namjoon?  

* What have they publicly acknowledged about the plots?  
 
* How do you think they balance the conceptual songs with other songs on the albums? Do you think they intend for everything be related in some way?  
 
* I've loved other musicians who have really conceptual albums (like Coheed &amp; Cambria and My Chemical Romance) and they've often supported their narratives with other media, such as graphic novels. Do you think BTS has any plans to expand the narratives likewise?  
 
* How do you think this narrative best serves their artistry, and what do you think is their ultimate end game with this?

If you're not familiar with that websites, it's a place to go to search for things you're interested in (like hiking, language exchange, board games, etc.) and find clubs that meet every so often to do activities together.

Is a meetup something I could organize, or is it against BTS's rules?  Would anyone even be interested in this?  ARMY is such an awesome fanbase that I want to meet more people like us.  We could have viewing parties for the BBMAs and new videos, etc.  We could have a book club where we read books referenced to by BTS (Into the Magic Shop, or other books NJ has recommended). We could get Korean BBQ and share theories.  Or try to learn some choreo.  :)  I think it would be fun, but I've never done something like this and need *your* advice!


**TL;DR:**
I'm seeking advice on:
*Would you ever even be interested in joining an ARMY meetup?
*What kinds of activities would you be interested in?
*Any suggestions on how to get people to join?
*Where to find BTS's official rules? (i.e. regarding when it is ok to take pictures of them)

Not necessarily promotion-wise or regarding how they'll perform ~~because we already know they'll do great~~, but more with regard to concept, themes, and BU plot development.

My predictions include:

* The glitches in BST will show that BST's implied equivocation of artistic revelation with sexual revelation isn't quite the right way to go about things.
* It's hard to imagine how tensions in BU could be any higher, so I'm curious how LY:T will fit in with the ""turn"" in story development. It seems like with the highlight reels, the turn has already occurred. Perhaps the ""turn"" is needing to face what they've done to each other? I'm actually very very eager to learn what more this series will have to teach me about my soon-ending youth.
* I think it's fair to think of Dope sort of being, like, Jungkook's concept. He rocked it. Jimin rocked BST. I think V will sort of ""star"" in / rock this upcoming concept.
