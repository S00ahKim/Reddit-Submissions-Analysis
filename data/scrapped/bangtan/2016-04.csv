8,2016-4-2,2016,4,2,2,4cx0xt,My theory on Rapmon's arc in the 'I NEED U' MV,PotassiumAlum,1459533561,"So recently I decided to rewatch a lot of the MVs and one of those was the original version of I NEED U and for a while now I've always been confused with Rapmonster's story in that MV. After reading some of the fan theories what I chose to believe, tho I'm not fully convinced, was that Rapmonster smoking in a gas station is really dangerous and would probably result in an explosion. But while they showed the other members dying or killing someone else, aside from Jin, the big reveal for Rap Monster was that he was just smoking a cigarette. And tbh it was pretty underwhelming for me and I suppose based on the comments on the web, a lot of other people too. But a while ago when I saw the MV it dawned on me. Rapmonster's story was not about an explosion. It was about smoking. Remember that the things they chose to adapt like depression, bullying, anger management problems, broken heartedness are all issues dealing with young people in korea and everywhere else. But explosions are not really a youth problem. Vices are. Keep in mind one thing: smoking kills. It may not be something like murder or suicide which have effects that are felt immediately, but smoking kills you slowly, painfully make no mistake. And that scene shown when the owner of the car throws money outside the window instead of giving it to Rapmon (gas station attendant) shows maybe the cause of the problem. It's that adults usually don't respect young people. And sometimes the resort of young people is to do adult things like smoke or drink alcohol so that people would take them a little bit more seriously because vices like that make them look and feel grown up. It's really subtle the way Big Hit did it but it speaks volumes. I understand why people misinterpret it a lot, but I can't help but admire the way they did it. It's not so obvious (tobacco companies might give them shit) but it really seems real and not preachy in any way. I love the fact that they identified the cause which shows great care for young people. It doesn't condemn the youth but also shows the shortcomings that adults make that contribute to this sad thing. I know I'm just writing my own theory as well but based on all that I've seen I think this makes the most sense and is the most realistic. If, on some small chance my theory is correct, I really applaud Big Hit and BTS for being such awesome role models and doing something that can really make an impact when seen in the right way.

This album contains all sorts of tracks they didn't release in their (back then) seven year old discography. I'm not sure if they ever actually promoted that album, but it was dedicated to their fans and it's my personal fave release of theirs.

Anyway, I just realized the same thing might apply for Bangtan? We were discussing possible remixes left and right, but this would be the absolute coolest thing, as they'd cater to fans who """"miss bangtan's old sound"""" and gift us some gems they have hidden over nearly three years. Also, this would fit with promotions being considered for this album, as there would be all old tracks.

What do you think? Plausible or not?",4,11

Also GFriend uses Son Seung duk as choreographer, if you don't know he's the infamous choreographer of BTS. I dunno what this company is, has no wikipedia page in english, but it looks like its got very close ties to Big Hit and considering that GFriend is very popular right now I wonder if Big Hit could have managed to debut a successful girl group. It seems like arguably the two most famous members of GFriend were their trainees and for even Mr. Son to choreo for them, wonder if they were offered to co-manage the group as well but they refused cause they want to focus on BTS. It wouldve been really great if the pressure to earn money was lifted a bit from the boys, it would give them time to rest and not have as hectic a schedule. But I guess it's also good that the focus and priority of the company is still them, more minds to work on their albums and concepts. Still, you gotta wonder. Nice to have had stablemates and friends among idols wouldnt be as lonely during events and all that and wouldve been nice to stan a secondary group lol. I wonder how many talented trainees Big Hit has in its basement. Haha. ",5,13

Symbolic use of flowers - Boy in Luv and Just One Day (red rose), I Need U (white lilies), Run (blue rose)

* MAMA Intl. Artist win
* Bonsang wins
* #1 on iTunes
* Top Trending on YouTube
* #1 on BillBoard Digital Album Charts
* 2^nd most followers on V-app
* And this overall craze ... and much much more!

**How do you think they become THIS successful ... both Nationally and Internationally?**

*Was it because of their music talent? Composition Style? Dancing Talent? Their cute/funny characters as we see their Bombs?*

SOOMPI TRANSLATION:

BTS member and leader Rap Monster just tweeted through the groups official Twitter account, revealing that he produced the song Young Forever, the first he has produced. He continues, Although I didnt do everything, it started with my draft so I am quite proud.  As I have just recently started arranging songs, I will show you good arrangements and tracks. Thank you always- RM.

***

**EDIT**

[ARMYBASESUBS Twitter TRANSLATION:](https://twitter.com/BTS_ABS/status/722465873219309568)

The song, Young Forever, is a song that I produced. lt's a song where I have taken the next step to producing/composing. I didn't complete it solely on my own, but this song started with a sketch/draft that I've had already so I'm proud of it. As much I just started to arrange songs, I hope to show you guys what I can do through tracks and songs that I've arranged as well. Thank you, always. - RM

**Thank you motionless-min: ""Apparently it's 3 new MVs - read the stuff down in the parenthesis [here](https://twitter.com/bangtanitl/status/722629545723953152) .""**

There has been confusion as to whether there is just 1 or 3 new MV for this album HwaYangYeonHwa: Young Forever coming up. What exactly was the MV (EPILOGUE : Young Forever MV) that just came out?


*There seems to be a couple possibilities from what I have figured (I'm kinda a new ARMY):*

-It is the ONLY mv coming out for this album, so it's the third and final MV of the trilogy. (It's called Young Forever which is the name of the album so it is the title track)

-It is one of 3 NEW mvs coming out, [there will be 2 more]. (Allkpop translation)

-It is a intro mv that is acting as a teaser to the real thing. (This makes sense because it's a weird move for Big Hit to drop the main MV 12 days before the album is out. Previously Big Hit would drop a 'teaser' 12 days before the actual release. Apparently Jin said in the fan cafe that this is an intro?)


I've heard many different interpretations of the translation? But no sources to the actual original korean statement. Does anyone know the consensus of the number of MVs with proof?

Help &gt;.&lt;
Sincerely a lost ARMY

I'm 28 and am married with a kid and am obsessed with BTS.  Taehyung is my bias and it really weirds me out sometimes that he is 8 years younger than me.  Also my age is probably the number one factor in why I could never have Jungkook as my bias.  It definitely is weird sometimes to see the age difference between me and the members let alone fellow ARMY's.  It always hits me hardest when people talk about how comebacks are going to distract them from finals or how their parents won't give them money for albums.  It always makes me feel so old.

So where are my fellow noonas at?",108,41

221,2016-4-21,2016,4,21,5,4fph0x,My INU + Prologue + Run + Epilogue unifying theory,Sassinak,1461185275,"TL;DR: the music videos for I Need U, Prologue, Run, and Epilogue give a continuous, complete narrative in which the boys die, spend time stuck in purgatory, come to terms with their lives and deaths, and are finally able to move on to heaven.


INU TL;DR: Jin dies. The others aren't coping well. They do things that either forshadow or bring about their own deaths.


Prologue TL;DR: Chronologically, this story is contained within the INU series of events. The boys (minus Jin) spend time together and take a trip together. We see the events through the eyes of Ghost-Jin. V decides not to live on, and jumps to his death. 


Run TL;DR: The boys have all died and are stuck in a collective purgatory made in their own imaginations. They don't realize they're dead, but sometime they sense something isn't right. They act out their baggage from life by being destructive (#justhoodlumthings).


Young Forever TL;DR: The maze is another metaphor for purgatory, but now the boys have realized and accepted that they're dead and they want out. They make it out and, as a group, run / fly off into the sunset / heaven. There, they'll be young forever.


I think I'll have to use the comments for my industrial-strength rambles about each individual mv and all the supporting details for this theory. Seriously, buckle up kids. I'm not sure if the comment for each mv will stay in order -- you might have to skip around to read them as intended (INU --&gt; Prologue --&gt; Run --&gt; Epilogue). Most of my thoughts from the first three mv's are nothing original or unique, and have been rehashed a million times, but they have that much more context now with the Epilogue. I'd also love to hear your theories / things you noticed from the Epilogue and the series as a whole.


EDIT: Now with more rambling!

YesAsia seems reliable, but overpriced to me. Perhaps it's better for those buying from outside of the U.S.

The typography on the day version seems larger though. It seems to be ~20 USD per album without shipping. No info on the actual photos as of yet.

We all love BTS, we are all being positive, but then why do these people come in and tell us we aren't good enough? As long as someone isn't saying hurtful things to a member, why does it matter? Everyone has their main fave, but I feel like ARMY in general love them all and give attention to everyone. I know Jin made a comment about EatJin not getting as many viewers as the others but he still got quite a lot and I think it also ties into that a lot of people are uncomfortable watching others eat. I know I personally can't handle sounds of eating(I have misophonia, it causes panic attacks) so I can't watch it. The mukbang thing is mostly a thing in Korea, so I feel like it's unfair to judge people for not turning out in droves to watch something that is awkward to most cultures.

But yeah, can we just stop? We get enough hate as a fandom from others because of the overenthusiastic fans, why do we need to hate on each other so much? I know there isn't much of this stuff here but I hope you can all attempt to dissuade others you see that encourage this sort of attacks.",21,14

But as far as we know, Jin has had brown hair this whole time. Hobi's hair was far lighter in the shoot than it is in recent photos/livestreams, same with Kookie I believe. We all saw Yoongi's silver hair, so idek why no one bothered keeping that a secret. Tae and Jimin are easily explainable--orange and black respectively could have been sprayed on for the shoot. Perhaps Namjoon's silver could be sprayed on as well. 

What baffles me is the boys that are sporting lighter hair in the shoot and (as far as we know) darker hair now (Jin, Kookie, Hobi). Jimin also has brown as opposed to black hair right now I think. Are they keeping their current colors for comeback, do you think? Or will they go back to photoshoot colors? Has Jin been hiding bleach blonde hair from us this whole time??",17,15

Ok, so the song has been released for five days. I think we had enough time to digest the song and let go of the hype. So what are your thoughts on Young Forever? 
Do I or do I not like the song? Yes, I do like the song. I love its anthem-like feel; I love its cheerful and optimistic atmosphere. It is the type of songs I listen to when I want to be at my most productive self, and I feel like I can conquer the world (To be honest, most of BTS's songs does that to me). As always, I love their lyrics. Its a given: their songs are beautiful. They exude so much hope, but also so much vulnerability. I like that their albums always display their cocky attitude while also showing their vulnerable side. ""There is no such thing as an eternal audience, but I can still sing."" That hit me to the core. Regarding the musical production, I have to say that it did feel incomplete. The buildup is great; it's something that BTS excels. The main reason it feels incomplete is due to the use of a chorus. Having no chorus you can have a song that is long or a song that is short without feeling like it is. But a chorus implies that the song will follow the regular song structure. And because it doesnt follow the traditional song pattern that one mostly associates whenever there is a chorus. It just feels incomplete. I think the reason why Nevermind and the intro for HYYH part 1 worked so well is that there is a buildup and a decrease in intensity, but no chorus. Ja feel? 
Anyway, yes, these are my thoughts on the song. 

I like reddit, because we can have discussion. So type away all you want. Why did you guys think?",17,19

One the one hand, it'd make sense for Hoseok to have a studio as well seeing as the rap line has been involved in Bangtan's music production since the beginning, Hobi's always been a lyricist, and he's definitely working on producing music of his own (1 Verse, anyone? And I think he said in his Now3 interview that he has more coming) 

On the other hand, he might not have his own studio like Namjoon and Yoongi do--the other two tweeted out their spaces. Bighit maybe hasn't given Hobi his own space because he doesn't have nearly as much producer cred as the other two, and he could very well be doubling down on his dancing instead and not be working on enough music to need his own studio at all.",2,10

The [FAQ page](http://www.kconusa.com/kcon-info-faq/) is still down for crying out loud. **So if this is the wrong place I apologize but my friend and I are going for the first time and need answers.** I am hoping there are are people on this sub who have been to the con before and help us:

*Will there be one concert or two? (For KCON-LA they always make it two concerts.)

*How does the [ticketing](http://www.kconusa.com/kcon-ny-tickets/) work? I have heard that when you buy combo it's for both days. Then I heard that combo is for the number of people going, not the number of days so I have no freaking clue.

*What is typically included in the goody bag? I want to get a lightstick for the concert but I have heard at past BIG BANG shows they have included a light stick in their goody bags and was wondering if KCON would be the same way. I want a BTS lightstick and am debating if I should buy it now or not.

*What is the difference between the fan engagement (hi touch vs. audience)? I am guessing hi-touch is high fiving the idols but not sure on that or the audience experience.

*Could I take my big DSLR camera and lens for my personal use or does it depend on the venue?

*How does the guarantee and chance experiences work? Especially when buying tickets for multiple people. (If I high touch with BTS I will probably faint but it needs to happen).

*Thanks in advance! :D*",9,10
