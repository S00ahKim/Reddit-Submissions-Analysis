# Results, Growth, and Changes

Here's our complete, comprehensive, 6,641-word, 19-page, thoroughly peer-reviewed document containing the 2017 results, along with our observations in the growth and changes within our subreddit's preferences over the last year.

&amp;nbsp;

**[2017 CENSUS RESULTS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T-Qo9SrsHT0XkvesX6ApgoiZUOLXqXPY/view?usp=sharing)** (429kb)

&amp;nbsp;

Below, we've listed highlights from the document. For brevity, we used general statements, saying *subscribers* instead of *subscribers who participated in the census*. Last year's 2016 census results can be seen in full [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/5sjwn5/census_results_2016/). 

&amp;nbsp;

**FAIR WARNING: lots of numbers ahead!**

&amp;nbsp;

## SUMMARY 
 
- The census was carried out from 1 Dec to 14 Dec 2017. From the 16,881 subscribers (at the time of census closing), **1,509 responses (8.9%) were recorded**. In 2016, we had a higher participation rate of 15.7% (796 responses out of the 5,083 subscribers).

- The answers were mostly similar to last year's results. There may be some small differences between this and the print version as we have had some more time to finalize everything since then, but results are still fairly representative. 


&amp;nbsp;

## I. DEMOGRAPHICS

**AGE**

- Similar to 2016, the largest category is 18-22 (618 | 40.1%), followed by 23-27 (466 | 30.9%).

- The age profile of the subreddit has increased slightly. Age groups 13-17 and 18-22 both lost 4-5 percentage points and age groups 23-27 and 33+ increased 4-5 percentage points compared to 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

**GENDER AND SEXUALITY**

- Similar to 2016, most subscribers identified themselves as female (1,235 | 81.9%).

- However, there was an increase in male subscribers from 2016 of about 4 percentage points.

- Subscribers still predominantly identify as straight (986 | 65.3%), followed by bisexual (243 | 16.1%).

&amp;nbsp;

**ETHNICITY AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND** 

- Similar to 2016, most subscribers came from an Asian background (713 | 47.2%) -- including East Asian (331 | 21.9%), South-East Asian (300 | 19.9%) and South Asian (82 | 5.4%). The next-largest demographic was Caucasian/White (686 | 45.5%).

- Note that respondents could pick up to 4 options for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**COUNTRIES OF RESIDENCE**

- Respondents came from 70 different countries and territories (an increase from last year's 64).

- The top 3 countries remain the same: United States still leads overwhelmingly (721 | 47.8%), followed by Canada (167 | 11.1%) and Australia (86 | 5.7%).

- United Kingdom, Philippines, Germany, Singapore, New Zealand, Brazil, and Malaysia round out the top 10 countries.

&amp;nbsp;

**EMPLOYMENT STATUS** 

- This category experienced a large change!

- The number of employed subscribers (515 | 34.1%) rose by almost 10 percentage points from 2016.

- Students, both employed (306 | 20.3%) and unemployed (577 | 38.2%), describe the largest group of subscribers, but the number of employed students dropped by around 4 percentage points and the number of unemployed by around 6 percentage points.

&amp;nbsp;

**RELATIONSHIP STATUS**

- Like in 2016, the largest category was 'Single' (1,133 | 75.1%), though this has decreased by about 3 percentage points compared to last year. ^NICE

- This is followed by 'In a Relationship' (245 | 16.2%) and 'Married' (96 | 6.4%).

&amp;nbsp;

## II. BTS AND KPOP

**TIMELINE** 

- Most subscribers became fans during the *You Never Walk Alone* era (293 | 19.4%).

- Over 30% of people joined in 2017, correlating with BTS' massive growth and achievements in that year.

- In the 2016 census, the largest group of fans joined during * pt.1* (30.1%).

&amp;nbsp;

**KPOP**

- As in 2016, most subscribers had listened to kpop before BTS (1,049 | 69.5%).

- However, new kpop listeners increased to 30.5% from the 20.1% in 2016.

- Similar to 2016, most subscribers have been listening to kpop for 1-2 years (17.2%).

&amp;nbsp;

**DISCOVERY**

- Similar to 2016, most subscribers found out about BTS via browsing YouTube (574 | 38.0%), followed by introduction from a family member, friend, or significant other (407 | 27.0%). 

&amp;nbsp;

**MUSIC PURCHASES** 

- Similar to 2016, free streaming (1,107 | 73.3%) tops this chart.

- Paid streaming (725 | 48.1%) and physical albums (688 | 45.6%) closely follow.

- The largest change was Arr, Matey..., exhibiting a drop of over 6 percentage points compared to 2016, with far fewer ARMY sailing the high seas!

- Note that respondents could pick as many options as applicable for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**MERCHANDISE**

- A larger percentage of subscribers (662 | 43.9%) bought merchandise in 2017 compared to 2016 (39.9%).

- The official merchandise section was split into concert DVDs, official lightstick, and other official merchandise, and cannot be directly compared.

- Note that respondents could pick as many options as applicable for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**CONCERTS AND EVENTS**

- The number of people who have been to a concert (19.2%) increased by about 4 percentage points compared to 2016, likely due to the WINGS tour.

- Sadly, the majority of respondents (1,220 | 80.8%) have yet to see BTS perform live. &amp;#x2639;

&amp;nbsp;

**BTS NEWS**

- The percentage of subscribers using r/bangtan as one of their news sources (1,405 | 93.1%) increased by 5 percentage points compared to 2016.

- Those using r/kpop (698 | 46.3%) decreased by about 5 percentage points.

- Most other categories exhibited some sort of decrease, with the most severe being Tumblr (358 | 23.7%), which lost over 16 percentage points, and BTS-specific translation sites (325 | 21.5%), which lost over 14 points; the latter may be explained by their relative inactivity or their migration to Twitter in 2017.

- The only other category to remain stable was Twitter (948 | 62.8%), gaining just over a percentage point as the second most used news source.

- Note that respondents could pick as many options as applicable for this question.

&amp;nbsp;

**KOREAN LANGUAGE KNOWLEDGE**

- Like last year, most subscribers know a few words of Korean (929 | 61.6%).

- Most respondents are interested in learning Korean (778 | 51.6%) or are already learning Korean (334 | 22.1%). !

&amp;nbsp;

**USE OF THE SUBREDDIT**

- The addiction level to r/bangtan has risen since 2016; browsing the sub multiple times a day (845 | 56.0%) remains the most popular category AND has risen by around 9 percentage points. ^(Thank you, mods!)

- Other subscribers browse once a day (325 | 21.5%) or a few times a week (203 | 13.5%).

My question is, will everybody sit accordingly at their right seat (apparently we all have our own seat number) or is everyone sitting wherever they want, because if so I would preferably sit with my friends.

Winner was number 625, and made me very jealous lol but hat's not the point. I got really curious to know what were the name of songs in that mp3 player... I searched a bit but couldn't find any info on it. Idk if that number 625 is still an army and whether they've kept that mp3 after 5 years or no, but if anyone has read anything on this anywhere on internet and knows where i can get the track list of that mp3, please tell me.

My boyfriend expressed interest in watching kpop vids together with me, because I have a huge interest in it.
I really love kpop and BTS and I watch many vids, but I am always a little bit sad that I don't have friends to talk about it.

He is just very interested in the kind of videos I watch and why I actually like kpop. He also just likes doing things together, so he suggested watching some kpop vids together. So he could maybe, also get into kpop and we could talk about it together.

But....what should I watch together with someone who actually isn't really interested in kpop?

I was thinking of watching Bon Voyage together, because it's mainly about just the boys having fun and having adventures while traveling. Dealing with stuff they are not used to, etc. And it's pretty funny.

I also feel like it feels less scripted than variety shows where they go through the usual routine of games, random play dance and answering fan questions. (Nothing wrong with that though) but my boyfriend said he preferred watching something that isn't scripted that much.

The only worry I have is that it may be too hard to differentiate the boys in Bon Voyage, so maybe it's not as fun to watch if you just can't figure out who is who? Idk

What would you show someone who doesn't know about kpop?

[TL;DR] My boyfriend wants to watch kpop vids with me, but isn't actually into kpop. I was thinking of watching Bon Voyage, but I am worried it may not be as fun if you aren't able to differentiate the members. What would you recommend someone who isn't into kpop? ",45,93,False,self,,,,,

The website is not fully finished yet but I'm uploading new content every week.

Also, I used to teach Korean in Australia, and I thought I can make some Korean study materials with BTS content.

At 2pm CST, I will be answering any questions you have regarding my involvement with BTS as it relates to my work in the media, and specifically to the Westwood One Podcast that recently launched entitled Stokes &amp; Friends: KPOP with T.H.I.S.   First off, Im honored to be on this board with so many music lovers.  Ive been lucky that due to my various positions with Westwood One over the years, that I was introduced to the guys last year at the BBMAs and a great relationship developed between myself, Bighit, and the guys; that is based on my belief that this group, and what they represent, is crucially needed right now.  When I started my coverage, there werent that many of us in the mainstream American music media that were providing coverage, Im glad to see that this has now changed.  That being said, I have a dream that this act becomes a stadium act in the US, and for that to happen there needs to be greater coverage and support from Mainstream American Media. 

We have had hangs &amp; interviews in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Asia; and I can say this; you all have chosen wisely when it comes to an artist that is worth putting your energy and resource into.  BTS is special in so many ways, and I hope our Podcast can help people build a closer relationship to this incredible group of guys.

Below are links to the podcast for both iPhone users, and for Android &amp; Non-Iphone users; I so appreciate your comments and your support of what has become a big passion project for me. r/bangtan also requested some bio info as well which I have below; as well as my @stokesnfriends Twitter which is currently my central platform for messaging out newsIm sure that will adjust as I become more adept at Reddit!

Let me start by saying I am not attacking anyone or singling anyone out and you will see that reflected in the type of language used. More than anything the goal of this is to just make as many people aware of what's going on and why it is not and should not be acceptable. The only reason I am addressing this more towards ARMY is because it is the fandom that I am most familiar with and was a part of, but this is by no means JUST an ARMY thing, but ARMY may arguably be the biggest culprit of it currently. 

I started being a fan of BTS about 1 year and 2 months ago. I am not as old a stan as some, nor am I as new as some either. I have a bias, his name is Jungkook. I support BTS as best as I can. I vote. I buy their songs digitally. I occasionally buy physical albums. I stream on multiple platforms. I am going to their concert when they are in town. I want BTS to do well. I want Jungkook to do well. 

There have been some times where I have been incredibly proud to be ARMY, but there are times where I am honestly embarrassed at what I see on Twitter, Instagram, and gradually even here on the sub-reddits. These embarrassing times are growing, fast. Now let me be clear that I know not everything is bad. I have personally met 4 incredible people, people I consider close friends, just by being a fan of BTS. I stan BTS. I am a fan of BTS, of that there is no question and no doubt. Do I consider myself ARMY right now? Would I consider myself as part of any fandom? Quite frankly, no, and here's why.

In the end it comes down to respect, or rather a lack of respect for people who are multi's, those who have biases, other groups, other groups' fans. 

I enjoy the music of multiple other groups. I love Blackpink songs. I have some Big Bang songs. I have some RV songs, Mamamoo songs, Wanna One songs, Seventeen songs, EXO songs. Being a multi does not make me or anyone else any less of a fan than someone who only supports one group. As humans, we are allowed to have our opinion, have our likes and dislikes. 

On the other hand, having a bias and wanting our bias to do well also does not make any of us less of a fan of the entire group. A prime example of this is the recent Euphoria trend that started in Korea and gradually seeped through to international fans. Wanting a studio copy of Euphoria because we don't have one, or bringing attention to a song that deserved more attention is not wrong. It does not make us a solo stan. It does not EVER justify attacking someone with a bias personally or asserting they are *just* a solo stan. These personal attacks, bullying, harassment of people who have publicly shared a different opinion are cruel. I have seen people get bullied and harassed off of a platform because of just an opinion they've shared. It's not right, it's cruel. We are all people, we can have our own opinions. 

Think about how attacking someone will affect their mental state. Depression is a very real thing, and it does not take a lot to set off a chain of events that you really do not even want to fathom. I know, because I've been there. For a specific example that ARMY reading this will know, just look at Headliner and the kinds of things she has had to deal with: death threats, threats to her family, threats disguised as orders etc. I am certain this type of thing occurs in other fandom's too. Understand that when this happens, they are NOT supporting the group. They are embarrassing the group, and themselves. This type of behavior should be condemned, not celebrated. It should be stopped, not circulated to the masses. Understand and realize that doing any of these malicious things under the guise of supporting BTS or whatever group it may be does NOT help that group whatsoever. In fact, as it pertains to BTS, a lot of people are scared to give BTS a try because of the fandom. Are we really supporting BTS when this is the case?

The same applies with trashing and talking down other groups or their fans. It certainly appears that ARMY is the biggest culprit of this because quite frankly it seems like BTS' success has made a vast portion of fans extremely arrogant and egotistical (I do know that ARMY are not the only one's who trash groups). BTS' success can not be used to attack other groups or think of other groups as inferior. The whole debacle today and yesterday with the FIFA voting and other fandom's supporting EXO's Power just so BTS does not win is at least 50% the fault of ARMY, likely more. It's a direct result of all the incendiary things that have been said, all the ""wars"" that have happened. Yet still, after the voting was over there are still so many who have stuck to the same old ways. Did BTS deserve to win? Yes. Did EXO also deserve to win? Yes. And guess what, both songs are being played. There is nothing wrong with believing one favorite group is the best, but there's no need to put down other groups or their fans. The other groups are talented too. They have good songs too. They also have dedicated fans that just want to see their group succeed. BTS, EXO, Blackpink etc. will never ask fans to put down the other groups. Look at their interactions at award shows. They support each other. They're friendly to each other, and most of all, you can see how much respect each and every group has for one another.

In the end all this comes down to respect. If nothing else, respect that the other groups work hard. Respect that they too have dedicated fans. Respect the fact that they put out music that people enjoy. Respect that there is a HUMAN BEING behind that Twitter/Instagram account. No one is saying that one has to help another group stream or win awards or anything of the sort, but it is entirely possible to respect all groups and their fans while STILL supporting the group you love most. The two are not mutually exclusive. Just like how being a multi but having one favorite is not mutually exclusive. Having a bias and still supporting the entire group is not mutually exclusive. It does not make you less of a fan. It certainly does not make any of those who attack other fans and groups any more of a fan. We are all better than this. We can all get along. There are respectful ARMY's, EXO-L's, Blinks, VIP's, and more out there. There is room in the KPop genre for all the groups. There is success to be had for all the groups. 

For the ARMY reading this, and for the other's who've made it this far, indulge me one last paragraph. Remember the ""Love Yourself"" message. I believe it is a message that says we should strive to be better than ourselves the previous hour, day, week, month, year. We should be comparing ourselves to ourselves, not to others. Extend that beyond and realize that BTS and all the records they've broken, the next time around they are competing against themselves. If they end up surpassing some other record they didn't have, great. If they don't, that's okay too. You can see it in what each member says, they just want to be better than they were. Another example, Blackpink now holds the record for most MV views by a kpop group in 24 hours now. The next time Blackpink comes back they'll be going up against that record they got. The point is not to beat other groups and try to monopolize everything. It's about beating the previous result that the group had themselves. I think the sooner more fans realize this the happier and less stressed they will be, and the better the relationship fan's will have with each other.

Thanks for reading. What do you all think about the state of ARMY, or the fandom you are a part of, and just fandom's as a whole?",3,4,False,self,,,,,

Today I saw marketing lead for Olympic publicly stating that he used BTS and K-pop animosity towards BTS for marketing.

I saw kmedia airing one hour long video about us. They tell BTS' songs are social related while showing I Need U, Boy in Luv etc. They tell international fans know the meaning of the songs while showing an ARMY who has no idea about their song meaning. They show older ARMY while stating that the real reason why she stans BTS is not their music.

They state fans are into their meaningful music while making an ARMY explain BTS' twitter selca.

I saw some company mediaplay how their group beat BTS on some poll.

I saw news article stating BTS' songs chart on BB due to their SNS while others due to their quality music.

I saw some old man mobbing BTS, taking their pic &amp; selling it.

It all tells me that something is going wrong and that we should change our move.

There was a time when voting was beneficial  to BTS. We voted in any polls that had BTS in order to let the world know that BTS exists &amp; show that there's huge demand for BTS. Yes, thankfully we made it. BTS's all over the news. The world atleast heard the name 'BTS' or 'ARMY'

But now time has changed. They want to know ""who is BTS"" Defending on our moves and answer we give, the worlds deciding how to mark BTS.

I think it's time for us to stop voting in polls that bring on purpose another kpop singer against BTS. If we don't give them clout, I don't think it'll be a thing.

I don't think even things like teenaward bestfandom etc. would benefit BTS now. I feel like these kind of things will feed the image ""BTS is hot kpop group, who has obsessed rabid crazy fangirls"" ""SNS group""

I'll start:

- Before Tear, there was a point at which ARMYs were really bored so we became [BTS objects](https://twitter.com/kookspidey/status/1003877021355655168?s=21). The hashtag was #WeArePartOfBangtan and it trended worldwide. Accounts included Namjoon's passport, Hobi's shoes, and Jungkook's buttons... truly jobless

- In January 2017, antis came up with cruel things that stood for BTS. Then ARMYs hijacked the tag and came up with hilarious alternatives. The tag was [#BTSstandsfor](https://twitter.com/dailyunnie/status/822271457510105088?s=21)

- #ARMYVoteChallenge trended worldwide in February as a campaign to vote for the iHeart awards! It was fun to tag friends and get tagged. This was an [example](https://twitter.com/_saranghaejjk/status/958705654117486592?s=21).

- In 2017, K-ARMYs had their own viral fanfic au about Nochu, the bunny serial killer. The hashtag was #killerjk and the [fanart](https://twitter.com/durenosaurus/status/829137742399287297?s=21) [was](https://twitter.com/cosmicpens/status/820796593465151488?s=21) [amazing](https://twitter.com/_parkellie/status/925677808264851456?s=21)

- In late 2016, ""famwar"" first became a thing in our fandom when a Ph-ARMY suggested it on YouTube. The famwar was between #TeamFire and #TeamBST, to race to see which MV would reach 100M views first. I was on #TeamFire and for the record we won 

- During BBMA voting last year, a horror story came up where a [Tumblr](https://twitter.com/dailyunnie/status/863858034547638272?s=21) post revealed it felt like someone was missing when we saw group BTS pics..... hence, #REMEMBERTHE8THMEMBER trended worldwide as ARMYs edited ghost spaces in group pics and made [conspiracy theories](https://twitter.com/parkvminxx/status/864841503159468032?s=21)",40,130,False,self,,,,,

Hi everyone! This is Shelly, as my gift for the 5th anniversary, I made this little spreadsheet for everyone who play Superstar BTS.

This spreadsheet contains collected data of HARD MODE ONLY. I made this for those who would like to explore this area of difficulty in the game.

This spreadsheet features:
1. Duration in minutes and seconds per song
2. Sub-category of duration of main gameplay in the unit of seconds (TPT- Touch Play Time)
3. Estimated Maximum Combo (EMC)
4. Total Hit Score
5. Average Hits Per Second (AHPS)
6. Combos Per Second (CPS)
7. Card Rotation/ Activations/ Revolutions

These features have their own sheet and sorted according to its category (t/n please visit the other sheets to read the detailed explanations for each feature)

I will do my best to update the spreadsheet monthly depending on the updates of the game.

Sorted sheets inside:
1. Songs by Album (as of 180705)
2. By Duration
3. By Difficulty
4. By All Combo
5. By Hit Scores
6. By Card Rotation



Folder Download link :
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1qG_C6U2NKAUbXRZ_aSRCIYMv-q4zH6IF



I will only upload the updated spreadsheets on the Google drive folder link stated above.

I hope this helps! ENJOY!

Just here to update you on our campaign progress this month!

  
A few days ago we wrapped up our #ARMYLoveMyself\_June campaign, in which we supported UNICEF in honor of the boys and their anniversary. This month, our campaign is #ThirstRelief\_July, in which we're partnered with Thirst Relief International, and our goal is to provide BioSand water filters to families and schools (mostly in Tanzania) who are reliant on water sources that are contaminated due to waste and upriver industrial pollution. BioSand filters are sustainable, constructed locally, and are specifically designed for home, clinical, and school use. They filter out heavy metals, disease-causing bacteria, viruses and protozoa and significantly improve the lives of people who suffer from water-borne illnesses. Each filter can provide clean water daily for up to 10 people, and will last for approx 25 years.

So far, ARMY has raised enough for 28 filters (and counting)! Which is frickin amazing. We were informed by our contact at Thirst Relief that a typical Tanzanian village can be fully supplied with about 20-30 filters, so ARMY has basically already fallen within that range, and we're only 1/3 into the month. We set the goal small, only for one filter at a time, and then set the goal for another after we reached that. We also decided to do something different this month to make it fun, so we incorporated a game that's part map puzzle, part quiz, part story, that raises awareness about the need for clean water and allows ARMY to make new decisions each time a new filter is raised. It's been pretty fun (well, we think so, and it's gotten positive results). We'd planned to implement the story/game after a few days, by which time we hoped to have about 8 (7 for Bangtan 1 for ARMY). But ARMY being ARMY blew through about 17 on the first day, and we had to scramble to catch up!

We added a \[Meet The Team\]([https://oneinanarmy.wixsite.com/home/meet-the-team](https://oneinanarmy.wixsite.com/home/meet-the-team)) section to our website, so people can see who does what on the team, and we also added Moments to our twitter profile that tracks past campaigns as well as what One In An ARMY does, how we operate. We also have added a Moments section to keep track of different ARMY charity and volunteer projects that we come across.

And finally, we put out a call today for people to apply to join the team, \[see here\]([https://twitter.com/OneInAnArmy/status/1016432946373365766](https://twitter.com/OneInAnArmy/status/1016432946373365766)). As always, ask us anything! - OIAA",0,67,False,self,,,,,

Then I started drifting away. I started to get into Stray Kids and slowly dedicated more and more time to them than to BTS.

That's how I fell out of the loop with Bangtan. I still watched their Run episodes and half of Burn The Stage with my sister and listened to their album (which name i forgot ugh this is awful), but other than that, I have no clue what's happening with them.

Would you mind telling me what they're up to these days? I know they have a world tour coming up? How have the members been these past couple of months? Is there something significant I should watch (a variety show, an interview etc)

Just wondering what are the most interesting dreams people have ever had about BTS.. 

So I had this weird realization from my dream last night. My biases have always been Jin and JK though I always thought I have stronger feelings towards JK. But last night, I dreamed about Jin and he was my bf lolololol *no shame* anyway the thing is when I woke up and analyzed the dream I realized what I feel towards JK is more like a big sister/mama bear protective feeling (maybe cos Im older than he is) whereas Jin is more like the fantasy bf ykwim. 

But then again Ive always related myself to Jin cos he has these tiny cute flaws and awkward all the time #storyofmylife and lets be real, JK is perfect. :P

Does anyone else think of the Japanese movie 5cm per second when watching Spring Day or the LY highlight reel? They have similar scenes and themes. Such as, snowy railroad tracks and taking a train through the snow, coming up to a giant tree in the middle of nowhere  (ex. Spring day). A boy and girl opposite the train tracks of each other as a train passes by them (ex. Highlight reel).  In Spring Day the lyrics talk about waiting in the winter for the spring day to come because one day well be together and to please stay and wait. In the movie the girl is far from the boy and the boy has to take a train in a blizzard to get to her.

This is going to be long...I'll do a TL;DR at the end for those who don't want to read the whole thing, it's just for clarity purposes. Also, moderators I hope this post is okay to be on this subreddit c:

So about two weeks ago I was on a plane with my mom, sister and niece. they caught a glimpse of my phone background which is a photo of Yoongi. My sister first asked who he was and I told them he was a member of BTS, what his name was, etc. I was blushing the entire time from embarrassment because they don't know the extent of my adoration for the boys and two, I felt like other people on the plane were listening. Anyway .My sister seemed to be, I don't think annoyed or concerned are the right words, but she replied, ""Why don't you have a photo of your family or your niece?"" Long story short about that, I don't particularly feel close to my family. They don't support my hobbies (video games, being nerdy in general) and it's why I hadn't told them about being a BTS fan, even though I've been Army since about February. So, naturally, I'm going to have a photo of something that makes me feel accepted and supported which is Yoongi/BTS. I explained to them that BTS has helped me with my depression, anxiety and self confidence, Yoongi specifically (and yes he is my ultimate bias). I also showed them my phone's lock screen which is a wallpaper with the lyrics to So Far Away on it because it reminds me that though Yoongi probably doesn't even know I exist I believe he is there for me. My mom and sister basically let it drop after that. In response to Yoongi as my wallpaper, my mom said ""Aren't you a little old for that?"" For reference, I'm 26. I don't  think it should matter how old you are for something to inspire and bring you hope. So that made me mad and I stopped talking about them.

Fast forward to this past Sunday, the 9th. My family came over for dinner and my mom was looking for something for my niece to sit on so she could sit up higher at my table without a high chair. She went to my bookcase and pulled out BTS' 2017 Memories book and I immediately panicked and took it from her. She asked what it was and I probably shouldn't have said this but I said ""none of your business"". My mom didn't immediately react but later when i was making dinner she asked why I got so mad. I explained the last time I talked about BTS she was very dismissive about them and i didn't want to talk about it again because it upset me. My mom kind of huffed and let it drop. I was annoyed for a good part of dinner and my dad asked if I was okay. He doesn't know about BTS, but I think my mom may have talked to him about it after they left my house.

Now to the main part of this post. This Tuesday morning, my mom sent me a text saying ""I'm sorry I hurt your feelings"". I told her that I hope she understood why I got so upset. I offered to show her songs so that she can see why they are so important to me. So,  I'd like to hear what songs you can suggest to show her? I already plan on showing my mom 21st Century Girls and So Far Away, but I'm not sure what else. I was thinking Lost or Tomorrow as well.

TL;DR - My mom doesn't understand why I love BTS so much and I need song suggestions to show her why.",59,53,False,self,,,,,

With FIFA playing us for votes, to fans accusing artists like Charlie Puth for using BTS for clout.

My opinion:

When it comes to celebrities. I fine with it. I view it as a mutually beneficial situation. Its part of the entertainment business and it REALLY annoys me when fans act like they can deem who is and isnt worthy of working with BTS or even just bringing them up.

The boys arent naive either. They know whats up. They arent secretly thinking said celebrity really wants to be their BFF. Or truly wants to work with them. They know who are serious and who isnt by virtue of who actually contacts them directly.

Until then, a name drop aint hurting nobody.

Re: Companies 

Im cool if some companies just have some fun with us. Like a Panda Express or the great Snickers vs Twix debate that turned into an all out candy war.

The place where I start getting ticked off is when organizers start manipulating us for votes and hype. Like FIFA did recently. Or when iHeartRadio plopped E$XO in for the best fandom awards.

How do you guys feel?

But it's very, VERY important for us that this request gets to BTS:

The HYYH/Love Yourself storyline needs to be turned into a novel.

I mean, fanfic is fine - but BTS knows the core of the storyline. They know the details. They know the things we can only assume. Therefore, they should be the one writing the book. More specifically, Namjoon.

For dummies and confused theorizers, here's the main storyline:
Prologue
Run (yes it's the prequel)
I Need U
Wings Teasers
BS&amp;T Japanese Version
Euphoria
Highlight Reels
Fake Love
The notes are spread throughout.

Now, here are some optional stuff:
The setting can be westernized.
The characters can not only be westernized, but diversified and/or genderbent.
The core storyline remains the same.

Please make this request reach BTS before the World Tour; or at the very least, before their next comeback. Please. We need this novel. I don't think the theorizers can endure a jumbled timeline and a lack of details.

Once again, the HYYH/Love Yourself storyline needs a book!",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I enjoyed the survivor games from the lovely [u/myeonq](https://www.reddit.com/u/myeonq) so here is a new one :)

Let's have a survivor game for Love Yourself  'Tear' now that we have survived their comeback (or you can participate from the grave too if you didn't :D).

As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.

Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

I will post a new poll every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted.

I saw a tweet earlier today about BTS music hooking you into being an ARMY and it got me thinking.

**Whats the first BTS song you heard that made you look for more of their music? Also, where and how did you encounter it?**

I think the first song I heard was Blood Sweat and Tears because an ARMY friend showed me the MV. I watched their MVs for Fire and Save Me after that, and I eventually made my way into the WINGS and Young Forever albums. What made me look deeper into their music were the lyrics to Lost though! I spent a good few days reading lyric translations for their songs after that.

What about you? I hope its okay to ask this here! Im really curious since there are a lot of new ARMYs too and it did get me thinking haha!",86,58,False,self,,,,,

I hope you guys can check it out and if you like it, please like the video, comment on it if you'd like and subscribe to the channel for the next upload. The schedule as of now for K-Pop uploads is going to be 1-2 times per week until the perfect algorithm for uploads has been discovered.

So I started noticing my friend rejecting guys for really weird reasons like ""his hair is not soft"" or ""he's hairy"" and when I saw her phone gallery full of Taehyung's pictures I kinda put two and two together.(she later verbally confirmed my suspicions)

Fast forward to my sister getting set up with someone really nice and wholesome, and the first thing she says is that: ""He's not Min Yoongi!"". I was left speechless and  didn't know where to start pointing out just how messed up that statement was.

I feel extremely guilty because I was the one who got them both into Bangtan. We're not teenagers for that kind of thinking to be brushed off as ""teenager fantasies"". This is a real problem and I don't know how to be stern about it and gentle at the same time. A gentle reality check, if you may.

I saw some people upset that BTS isn't trying to secure album of the year awards by releasing a repack, but instead a special album. And it was definitely on purpose because the article pointedly said *will not count with Tear. People discussed it a bit in the other thread but I guess I felt it was a good topic. I have a few theories. 

1. They don't want to play industry games 

It's in Korean entertainment industry's best interest to promote over consumption. And it's like if they aren't going to give BTS album of the year after their already tremendous sales, broken sales records and good critical reception, then it's like BH is saying ""screw it"". I feel like not wanting to play industry games extends to other things like not going on variety shows and such. 

2. Giving fans a break

I'm leading more towards this one. Army have been relentless in voting, buying etc. they decided not to promote and add sales because they don't want fans to feel obligated to buy their album because they've already done so much. BTS wants this to be a free-be of sorts. (Fans will still go crazy lol tho). 

3. Sending fans a message

BTS mentioned before sales, records, awards aren't everything. And by not putting out a repack they are telling fans pretty much that. They just enjoy making music and want to release something extra before their tour.

4. They just don't really care 

They've already won a lot and at this pint it's not a goal for them anymore. They'll let people who really want daesang have a chance to win them. (And they probably think it's not worth the craziness if they win more than one at an award show). 

It may not see like a big deal but I think it gives insight into BTS' and BH's way for thinking that can extend into other things. ",47,247,False,self,,,,,

Let's see exactly how much content BigHit releases in a year, how much of it is free and how much is paid. For this I considered all video released since 15^(th) July 2017 until 14^(th) July 2018.

|memories of 2017||09:05:00|
|total|27:14:17|35:26:50|

This year BigHit released 62 hours 41 minutes of content (fun fact that's 10 minutes 18 seconds a day), 57&amp;#37; of which is paid, and 43&amp;#37; of which is free.

Notice: the whole of Bon Voyage season 2 has been counted, for the sake of completeness and because the majority of episodes were published in that timespan. What hasn't been counted are personal vlives and gcf, as BigHit didn't have a hand in them.

What are your thoughts? Is this too much content? Too little? Do you agree with the paid/unpaid ratio? How much weight did the amount of content have in BTS's success? Is there really a glorification of BigHit due to it?

2. You can now **edit your submitted vote**. Just click on the link to ""Edit your response"" that appears after you vote (you can also just open the form again and it will take you to this same page).

**NOTE: If the login requirement limits voters on this sub, I will remove this requirement (the round will continue; it's just a settings change). Please comment or message me if this is an issue for you. Please also let me how you feel about these logistics changes.**

# And now for Round 2!

As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.

Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

*  **how long did it take you guys to learn all their names**? 
* Also did you mentally refer to them as something else as you noticed them/while you were still working their names out? 

(before I knew all of BTS' names, for the first videos I watched, I ended up labelling them as 'ice cream sundae hair guy', 'dimpled Visvim collector', 'Chilbongie's brother', 'Park Bo Gum's brother', 'Ji Chang Wook's younger brother', 'pouty puppy' and 'baby cop'  - L-R that's Suga, RM, Jin, J-hope, V, Jimin and Jungkook)",135,86,False,self,,,,,

Should the storyline that started from the HYYH series end with Love Yourself: Answer. Or do you think it will? Ive just been thinking.. I wonder if it would become too much if it still continued. Weve been on this journey for years and to understand the storyline, there are many music videos, notes, book references, and etc. to consider. 


Well first let me state that of course you can enjoy bts content without diving into theories and MANY people do so. I guess Im kinda gearing this towards people who semi keep up with theories or have kept up with everything thus far.


Do you think that this storyline would just become convoluted if BigHit decided to keep going? Or if it would be fine they keep doing it like theyve done before sorta abstractly the with Blood, Sweat, and Tears MV (in terms of references back to HYYH, the whole Demian theories are a lot to take in itself) But imo, I think ultimately, there will always be small references back to HYYH in the future. 


Oh and you can totally shut this down by saying Love Yourself: Answer will end everything. Because it probably will. But it just makes me wonder.. what if? If Love Yourself: Answer will be the end to the HYYH storyline, will we get something new? Will everything appear fine at the end but maybe Jin actually messes up the timeline again or a whole other incident happens and we continue with everything thats happened up until now becoming just a back story?


I dont know, this all may sound really stupid but its been on my mind lately. And the answer of will Love Yourself: Answer end everything might come soon with the teasers and MV (or MVs ). I guess this is more... a discussion of what you guys think will happen. And maybe a time to theorize everything before the Love Yourself era ends :)",37,71,False,self,,,,,

By no means i'm I an expert on singing/vocal training, but i've done research upon the topic and usually the answer would be the same. That the BTS vocal line lacks in technique when it comes to singing and after really listening to the experts explanations, me as an army couldn't to anything else than agree.

however the reason i would to like to bring this topic back is on the basis that fans rely to much on technique to value someone's supposedly future/deserved success and use BTS lack of technique against them, on how they do not ""deserve"" their fame. I might be biased I can't deny the fact, however even if their technique lacks.. I really like the sound of their voices and the kind of music they make. It amazing to have proper technique and talent, but if your sound/music isn't interesting/""good"" you won't get recognized.

What BTS should focus on is to get an vocal coach that can proper help them gain more control and technique over their voices, which in the long term will help the health of their voices.

P.S. as a fan/stan of multiple groups I bloody dislike the compare videos of vocals/rap e.x BTS v EXO vocals/SK v BTS",1,1,False,self,,,,,

With the trend of ""unpopular opinion threads and videos have an opening for people to hate on other groups opened, here is my thoughts on the topic.

I started liking Kpop in 2010 and have seen a lot of groups become popular, I have also seen what said growing popularity does to certain groups. As I guess most stans in this community are rather young I will be conduction this discussion with these two examples BTS and Blackpink since they are more relevant in today's age.

BTS and Blackpink are both groups that recently has gained a lot of new fans, both internationally and nationally. With their fast increase in fame has also a lot of hate towards these groups arrived. Many people use the term ""overrated"" to describe these groups. def; \*have a higher opinion of (someone or something) than is deserved\*. What these people are saying are that these two groups do not deserve their fame. In my honest opinion this is very wrong thing to say, since we all know of the harsh treatment of idols in the industry and how hard all these groups work to gain popularity and to get the chance to debut, and that they all deserve what they get.

If we were to look at it from a business perspective the groups might be ""overhyped"" def; \*make exaggerated claims about (a product, idea, or event); publicize or promote excessively\*. Especially in bangtan expirence we could say they have gotten overhyped in american media and BP might have gotten overhyped by new fans and/or the media, however by no means are they overrated in my humble opinion.

I think the criticizing of the groups might come from fans of other groups that rather want to see their favorites in BTS or Blackpink's position, which is 100% understandable however do not make your action of hate towards certain groups ok. To clearify I dont have anything agaist giving groups constructive criticism, but just stating someone do not deserve their fame is not constrictive at all. I stan multiple groups e.x BTS, EXO, Pentagon, Stray kids, day6, Twice, RV etc.. but never could i get myself to hate on groups I myself personally doesn't stan and I just find these comments very childish and unnecessary.

Thank you for reading my little rant :3 Love \_Viken\_

I really love to see your responses and comments! It was really tough to choose for me too. So many iconic looks and moments, but it seems like the fan winner would be Blood Sweat and Tears! That

And the main reason for that? Park Jimin with his sultry smoky eye and decadent jacket. ~~Big hit may want us to assume that V was the devil in the MV but honestly who's the real devil who dragged us into this wormhole huh~~

https://i.redd.it/6ul592lpuma11.gif

The runner-up went to Run (which was also my 2nd fav)! That casual, youthful look you want to wear yourself... The era that brought us mint yoongi and carrot jimin.

But, to celebrate the visuals we all stan, here's a little list to honor some of the iconic looks they had given us:

**Boy in Luv**

debut of silver-hair joon

**Danger**

Jin in red hair and eyeliner was underrated. the tsundere we dont deserve.

**War of Hormone**

Lavender V in that leather jacket and lollipop is a superior look

**Dope**

We all fell for the cutie at the police outfit at one point, come on. but blonde suga and doctor jin though

**Run**

Aside from the looks I mentioned above, i love hobi's [green jacket ](https://www.pinterest.com.mx/pin/344666177712734478)look the most. I kept the SSBTS S card of it just for aesthetic purposes.

**Fire**

Blonde undercut Jin and red haired tae were fan favourites! Overall i adore how the carefree message of the song translate to their styling

**Wings / Blood Sweat and Tears**

We need to talk about joon's low-cut top more. And dem chokers!

The Daesang award moment was ethereal, even wardrobe-wise

Being the McQueen devotee that I am,  I can't not mention [RM's chain brooch blazer](https://twitter.com/GetOnSwag/status/799959960356528128) and [JK's butterfly blazer](https://twitter.com/GetOnSwag/status/804638500410818560)

**Spring Day**

Grapemon for the win.

Blue fuzzy cardigan jimin!

**Not Today**

Stylist noona who gave Tae the bandana, you are the real MVP

**(BONUS)** Saint Laurent entrance at the BBMAs. ~~Just don't spill coke on it jin.~~

**DNA**

Jimin's Gucci jacket was the first thing I thought of. Too powerful

**Mic Drop**

Jin's [red motorcycle jacket](https://twitter.com/seokjinupdate/status/944090326867644416) needs more love!

**Euphoria**

All black hair? I love.

**Fake Love**

Kinky aesthetic aside, the harnesses fit into the song's concept on constraining too =

And of course, we could not forget Uniform Bangtan don't we?

It looks like J-hope has his back to 2 sides of himself. - Jin and kookie- Then, there's Jin is staring at his two sides of himself as well. -RM, Jimin- Then kookie looking at his two sides of himself. -V and Suga :)- 

And then at the very end, it's their two sides -Jin and kookie-, coming together. Along with the rest of their little bits about them selves, them being the rest of the boys haha.

So it looks like J-hope's looking away from the fact that there is two sides to his personality, while Jin and kookie are looking up at their two selves. And then instead of them having multiple sides at the end, it all comes together to create one. lol I'm sorry I just thought of this and thought it was some symbolism or a metaphor that I hadn't noticed before. But it also may not make any sense at all. Apologies in advance! haha

Then, you can see the statue which represents 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' (Three Wise Monkeys). In this mv, it talks about showing fake love, hearing fake stuff, speaking lies and fake stuff. The hands are stopping them from seeing the truth, hearing the truth, and saying the truth. This hurts them. Suga is then sitting near the piano, almost as if he is going to play it. The light shines on him in the dark room, representing that he is finally being real, or at least close to it. Jin tries to protect the flower in the lamp but it eventually turns into sand. When rapmonster appears, Jungkook is presented, right after it, we see a reflection of rapmonster wearing different clothes (the thing that goes wrong because he starts to realize he's fake). Everyone has been trying to protect their weaknesses in a way and they were trying to avoid Jungkook. Then, we see Jungkook noticing Jhope's room, right after that, a snickers bar goes into the room, later on, we see Jhope's room filled with snickers as a result of Jungkook. Also, if you notice, in Jhope's choreography, him and Jungkook stand against each other as if Jungkook is the reflection/ real him. This means that Jungkook is trying to show them all reality. As soon as Jimin notices Jungkook, the forest appears (his weakness). Also, as soon as Jungkook walks and notices there's a floor under him, the phones light up in Taehyung's room. The phones may represent lack of communication (correct me if im wrong, but with evidence please). As soon as Jungkook sees Suga's room, fire appears. Then, Jungkook carries the pile of sand, we see a shadow of the petals, representing there's another chance, another life, but they shouldn't be fake in it. The carousel in Jhope's room represents an endless cycle, maybe a memory he can never forget. His rap part as well sounds as if he's counting down numbers, which reminds me of when his mother left him when he was young. Jimin's running water represents his inability to escape from the endless cycle of pain. Him drowning in the Japanese version of a certain mv (can't remember which) represents his inability to escape adulthood. If you notice, v, rapmonster, jimin, jhope, jin, and suga don't really notice their true selves. Jimin cannot see the forest, V cannot see the 'save me' thing (notice that it says save me and not im fine, which is what he truly means), suga can't hear his piano, Jhope can't call for his mom again, Rapmonster can't see his true self, and Jin can't see his reflection on the window like he did before whereas Jungkook saw him. V finally sees the 'save me' sign when Jungkook opens the door and decides to give himself in to the magic shop since he can see their true colors and pain and it is what causes him his pain. All of the things I've said were about the other members but what about Jungkook? He has been in a black room where he can see the other members alone, his weakness is his ability to see that everything (their happiness) is fake.

The **others struggle after they notice him** , therefore the cause of his pain is himself or the other members or both. They exchange their bad moments with good moments with themselves (since they are the ones wearing black).the bad moments eat them up when jungkook goes to sacrifice himself ([4:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_6QmL6rExk&amp;t=254s)), they are all with him, they are in a 'desert' there's no life. they decide to die. Everything falls apart since he became aware of reality. It is jungkook who is becoming aware of it, they are not aware of it. In the last scene, the fake selves die. All of their rooms have scratches and dirt suggesting its a painful moment that has affected them, its a stigma, its always there. ",15,39,False,self,,,,,

I have a few western songs for variety. The 32 playlists with the most followers win prizes and the competition ends on August 11. The 2 top prizes is a $500 Ticketmaster gift card and the playlist being played at 8,000+ Starbucks stores. I would really be grateful if you follow my playlist. I really want to show everyone who walks into our stores how beautiful K-pop can be. Its no secret that on Twitter, the person who runs the Starbucks account is a BTS ARMY, so I think they would be thrilled to have my playlist played in stores.

Was it love at first sight or did they slowly penetrate your heart like they did with me?
I am ashamed to admit it, but I have known BTS waaay longer than I have been a fan. 

At first I knew their name, but never looked up their music. Because even though they were popular, I was already satisfied with the groups I knew. So I just assumed they were this really popular group of the newer generation kpop fans.

Later I heard even more people talking about BTS. Still thinking; wow they are so popular, even with people I didn't even know they listened to kpop at all! I think I looked up one MV, which was ""dope"". I listened but didn't fall in love yet. 

Just like most kpop fans probably, I follow soompi. And in sooo many articles they mention BTS. But there was this one article about ""most aesthetic kpop music videos"" and yeah, I love aesthetic music videos! So I looked through every MV in the list and BTS's ""blood sweat and tears"" was in it. I fell in love when they all ate you up while looking in the camera, i fell in love with the music and the dance. Like god, that moment they all do that sexy move on the ground(especially Jungkook took my heart there)...and then I fell in love with Jimin when he flipped his jacked from one of his shoulders and hit all those high notes. And the music video was SOO aesthetic.

From this moment on, I could 't believe I used to be such an uneducated piece of cupcake and looked up all their MV's and a few general variety shows like ""weekly idol"" and some interviews. And their Run BTS..and even though I didn't like RUN BTS that much at first, because I just couldn't recognize them all throughout all the games. At this point, I was a fan, but BTS still wasn't my bias group though.

Later..the love yourself world tour was announced. And I got tickets! So to make myself even more excited for when they come, I started watching all their other vids. ""Bon voyage"", ""American hustle life"", ""BTS bomb"", all ""BTS Festas"" and BTS reacting to their own MV's etc.
At this point I can say...BTS sneaked their way through as my bias group. I slowly fell in love with them, but they are steadily my bias group now.

How did you fall in love with them? Maybe at the sight of the first MV you saw of them? Or did you also take a longer route?",1,0,False,self,,,,,

We know about the Naver Blog and Twitter account but no linked Facebook and Instagram, from what I know I believe the Instagram one is real since I've been following it since last year, about Facebook one it's Smeraldo Academy last year I can't confirm this because I don't personally liked the page on Facebook, correct me if I'm wrong

The one which the screenshoot floating around on the internet with date hints and english caption many says it's fanmade which contributing to more confusion, many people are baited too because it seems like they know more and post more, why? They only reposting thing from last year and giving their own little twist, ^sounds ^like ^I'm ^demeaning ^them ^haha ^not, just want everyone to be sure okay

Little theory: Also the /official/ accounts as far as we know been ***resetting*** their post, why? why now? Here's my hot take, I only took a glance at their post and translation, it seems similar with they post last year with few changes, why again now? you may ask, since we already know that their storyline include time-loop and that Jin can alter time, my guess Smeraldo Shop is the equivalent of that in real life, Jin is *resetting* the timeline for LY: Answer (next August) to the moment before LY: Her (September last year), therefore Smeraldo Shop also going back in time, the rest we will see the next story in future comeback

As of July 20th, 2018, we currently have the following US distributors and pricing:
- Amazon ($27.98 + free 2-day shipping with Prime or free 5-8 business day shipping for orders over $25 w/o Prime) [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F99WH5Y)
- Target ($24.99 + $6-15 shipping based on shipping speed, in-store pickup not yet available) [link](https://www.target.com/p/bts-love-yourself-answer/-/A-53816959)
- Best Buy ($24.99 + $4 release-day shipping) [link](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/love-yourself-answer/34242081.p?skuId=34242081)
- Walmart ($21.95 + free 2-day shipping or free in-store pickup) [link](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Love-Yourself-Answer/585015576)
- Urban Outfitters ($27.98 + $5-22 shipping based on shipping speed, in-store pickup not yet available) [link](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/bts-love-yourself-answer-cd)

The following are each store's price matching policy:
- Amazon: does not offer price matching, but does have a link under ""Product Details"" for you to inform them about competitor pricing.
- Target: Will match the price if you buy a qualifying item at Target then find the identical item for less at select online competitors (all those listed above except for Urban Outfitters). Price matches may be requested at time of purchase or within 14 days after purchase. See [this page](https://corporate.target.com/about/shopping-experience/shop-with-confidence) for more details. It seems like Alaska and Hawaii Target stores may be excluded according to the page, but I recommend checking with the store to see.
- Best Buy: Price matches local retail competitors (including their online prices) and Amazon. See [this page](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/customer-service/price-match-guarantee/pcmcat290300050002.c?id=pcmcat290300050002) for more details.
- Walmart: they have the lowest price listed (+ free shipping!), so I don't feel I need to go into details. Will price match all mentioned US distributors except Urban Outfitters. It seems like Alaska and Hawaii Target stores may be excluded according to the page, but I recommend checking with the store to see. See [this page](http://help.walmart.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/31/~/walmart.coms-price-matching-policy) for more details.
- Urban Outfitters: does not do price matching at this time but does do price adjustment within 14 days of purchase if you find the item in-store at Urban Outfitters for less.

Honestly, just looking at this information, Walmart has the best deal. However, with the Memories of 2017 fiasco that recently happened, people may be less inclined to trust them. I don't recall them having any issues with LY:Tear though, so maybe it'll be fine. In any case, if you would like to purchase from another major US distributor, take advantage of their price match policy if they have one!",26,63,False,self,,,,,

My question is-- is it allowed(legal)? Do people get in trouble? Isn't it against BigHit policy to make money off of BTS's name? Do we have to contact BH first (like people do for fan projects)? I'm thinking of designing some stuff myself (I love getting creative) , but I want to make sure I don't spend a bunch of money just to get in trouble.

2. Fake love

4. Mic drop

I did a search for this song, and the first hit was a [post on](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Line-In/Featured-Artist-wrong-artist-needs-to-be-removed/td-p/4518369) spotify community by someone else who noticed the same issue - four weeks ago. And it's still not been resolved.

[Number of views](https://imgur.com/WfAQWRk) of BTS featured songs vs. other songs

[BTS's Artist page](https://imgur.com/OvDGct8), showing they appeared on this album


It seems they are using BTS's name for views, and it's working, as in the picture above. Spotify's algorithm is likely also recommending this song to other BTS fans based on the fact that they're featured on it. 


**Report**


Spotify on desktop allows you to right-click the song and select, ""Suggest an edit"". You can then go down to the Main Artists section and click an ""X"" beside BTS's name. I don't know if this only notifies the original artist and not BTS, though. 

Further, can anyone get this to BTS/BigHit so they can report the songs? I tried doing this myself but Spotify only allows either the artist, or the artist's rep to report for copyright/identity.

I've got a request for you guys. Since next school year is coming pretty soon, it also means new students incoming. I'll be a physiotherapy sophomore, and that means we have to integrate freshmen, which is really exciting. 

Since our school is kinda small (around 80 students per grade), every sophomore has a challenge to give, and freshmen do it. Now, let's get to the point : freshmen have to get me to teach them bits of BTS choreographies, and they have to dance it. So, I've been wondering which ones, in your opinion, could be relatively easy to teach and fun to reproduce.

So far, I've been thinking of Boy in Luv (Intro, pre-chorus and chorus) and Danger (Chorus). Also, kinda has prerequisites, but I've thought of JK's part in pre-chorus from Blood Sweat and Tears.

It's my first time posting here but I love writing poems on my free time and I loved all the poems in the recent Run BTS episode so I attempted to translate them...

I tried to retain the poetic-ness while translating so there may be some ""but this isn't the exact word he used"" kind of lines. I tried to mean the same things, just using a different tone/switching up order of words to make it flow better. But I still wanted to share since I had a lot of fun doing this! Here they are.

# Gold

by JK

    My mom dreamt of golden rain
    And those raindrops turned everything gold.
    
    The me who wasn't capable of doing anything
    Met you all at a golden time, And so I started to shine.
    
    At first I was the gold
    But when I look around me now, Everywhere is golden.
    
    I hope to not lose that.

# So What?

By V

    So What?
    
    Seokjin, don't be sad when you mess up the choreography.
    So What?
    You can be better next time.
    Eusha Eusha*
    
    Namjoon, don't be embarrassed after blowing kisses.
    So What?
    ARMYs die for those kisses.
    Pitter Patter
    
    Yoongi, I know you want to be born as a rock in your next life-- don't worry.
    So What?
    I will carry you around to all the beautiful places.
    Rock Rock
    
    Hoseok, don't make scary faces when we mess up the choreography.
    So What?
    -- Even wise men make mistakes. Please forgive us with your warm smile.**
    Bbooing Bbooing
    
    Jimin, don't stress about that day you made mistakes on stage because of your weight loss.
    So What?
    It won't change the fact that you're the most stunning person on stage.
    Euhuck Euhuck***
    
    Jungkook, don't bully us and don't work out to bully us even more.
    So What?
    Maknaes are supposed to be cute. Your muscles aren't.
    Ohgoo Ohgoo****
    
    So What?

\*  (Eusha Eusha) is like Fighting! in Korean

\*\*  () is a Chinese/Korean idiom that means even wise men can make mistakes in the sea of thoughts

\*\*\*  (Euhuck Euhuck)? Not sure what Tae meant by this but.. uh.. maybe cheering Jimin up? Or maybe saying something like ""Oops""?

\*\*\*\*  (Ohgoo Ohgoo) is what you typically say to babies to be playful

# Being Together

By Jimin

    Being together is hard.
    
    Meeting new people,
    Meeting different people.
    'Did I make a mistake?'
    'What's wrong with him?'
    The thoughts that haunt me
    When being together.
    So being together is hard.
    
    But when not together,
    I feel empty.
    When I'm happy,
    When I'm sad,
    When I want to be spoiled,
    I miss us together.
    
    Being together,
    Under the name of ""Us""
    Sharing the small things
    Wishing for Our happiness.
    
    And today when the sun sets,
    We are still together.
    That's what being together is like.

# I Giyeok*

By RM

    I remember.
    Taehyung's buzz cut.
    Jungkook's big innocent eyes and washed skinny jeans.
    Hoseok's gray padding jacket.
    Yoongi hyung's blue training pants.
    Seokjin hyung's dad-joke-free days.
    Jimin's chubby bo, bo, body.
    
    I remember.
    Our Han River.
    Our Bikes.
    Our GXXX V-neck shirts.
    Our chino shorts.
    Our Showcase.
    Our beef Bulgogi.
    Our green room chair.
    And our blood, sweat, and tears.
    
    All those memories,
    Tucked away
    In the deepest drawer in my mind.
    
    All those memories,
    My precious beginning, my first--
    Like , the first consonant in Hangul.
    
    So today, I  my  (I Gi-yeok my Gi-eok)**

\* Memory in Korean is  (Gi-oek) and the first consonant in Hangul is  (Gi-yoek). They're pronounced very very similarly.

\*\* My thoughts to this line is that there are multiple meanings? It can read as ""I remember my memories"" or ""I tucked away those memories but they're what makes me"" or ""Today, I am reminded of our beginning"" or... idk.

# Seed*

By J-hope

    Our Namjoon-ssi,
    Seokjin-ssi,
    Yoongi-ssi,
    Jimin-ssi,
    Taehyung-ssi,
    Jungkook-ssi,
    And... Hoseok-ssi.
    
    All these seeds (ssi) bloomed into delicate flowers.
    Beauty to some,
    Happiness to some,
    And the scent of nostalgia to some.
    
    Our Namjoon-ssi,
    Seokjin-ssi,
    Yoongi-ssi,
    Jimin-ssi,
    Taehyung-ssi,
    Jungkook-ssi,
    And... Hoseok-ssi.
    
    Blooming like roses,
    Flying like cherry blossom,
    Fading like the morning glory.
    Let our time together be
    Like those beautiful moments.
    
    I Ssirang-hae.**

\* Seed in Korean is  (Ssi). In Korea, when calling someone respectfully, you can append ""Ssi"" to their names (ex. Hoseok-ssi). They just happened to be the same word.

\*\* I love you in Korean is Sarang-hae. Hoseok did a play on words where he swapped Sa with Ssi to reflect the whole theme of the poem.

# What a Relief

By SUGA

    Five years since debut.
    Little guys full of dreams but nothing else
    Now have so much more.
    We used to only dream of our dreams
    But now we are the dreams of others.
    Life is a repetition of choices and regrets.
    I am scared. We are scared.
    We dreamt of flying high,
    But up here so cold
    I gasp for breath.
    The more light shines on us,
    The more shadow there is.
    What a relief that there are seven of us.
    What a relief that we are together.

# Run BTS

By Jin

    We're ran all the way here,
    BTS and ""Run BTS!""
    All things are bound a conclusion
    But I hope now is not that moment.
    
    I wanted to live like the flowing stream of water,
    But I am not a stream of water
    I am an animal;
    A fierce, passionate animal.
    
    Forming a family,
    Being happy,
    And achieving our dreams.
    But you can't stop the course of nature.
    
    As I age day by day,
    I look back at our dances.
    It was hard.
    Sungdeuk-ssaem*, our dances are really hard.
    I believe in you.
    
    Fighting to Namjoon and all of us.

I got into BTS in late 2016 and for most of 2017 listened to their music (a lot of HYYH on repeat lol) and watched their content devotedly. Bombs, interviews, tweet after tweet, you name it, I was trawling through the Content Index and /new to find it. Went to WINGS Tour and had a great time despite pit violence.

But recently I've been feeling like I'm in a slump in terms of my interest. Haven't watched Runs or Bombs for a while, much less interviews. I bought concert tickets but I'm more anxious than excited. Her then Tear came out and I... didn't like everything about the changes in sound, to be honest. I still listen to HYYH and some Wings songs often but I honestly don't know if I'm allowed to identify myself as ARMY now? just a casual fan? if that makes sense?

I don't think it's so much as that I'm tired of kpop - BTS got me into the rest of kpop and there are other artists I still follow fairly strongly. But I don't know. BTS is going further than they ever have and I'm so proud of their accomplishments. I just feel oddly detached, and feel selfish for wishing their newer music was more to my taste.

I will also say I feel guilty for trying to consider myself a fan but not liking all of their recent music. Which I know is unhealthy but it's hard to see all the hype currently around everything they do and think is something wrong with me for not being fully on board like I used to be?

Has anyone else been in this position, and if so what did it take to get you back into them? (If you're responding to this you're still here which I assume means something keeps pulling you back in lol - or if you've recently been a lurker here like me let me know. I think right now I just feel more alone in my BTS feelings than anything because everywhere I look, every ARMY loves everything and I just... wish I did too)",82,67,False,self,,,,,

So they're at least the same height, but Jimin still always looks taller? I don't really know how insoles work, but even when they wear the same kind shoe Jimin is still taller.

To put it bluntly, I really hate how some of the fans exaggerate the success these boys have. Dubbing them the world's biggest boy group to have ever lived is the dumbest comment I've ever heard. That's just pure delusion, and it most likely never will happen. To call them talented, is an understatement, however, they don't even begin to compare to the biggest legends to have ever walked this Earth such as the beatles and even Jackson 5. 

I don't want to burst anyone's bubble, but BTS falls into the Kpop genre, it isn't Kpop itself. 

Calling them the biggest boy group is kind of sad considering that a lot of boy groups outsell them in terms of album sales and they're already long gone and were here before streaming and music videos were a thing. 



Mods: if you remove this, that's some bias right there, but go ahead and tell me I'm ""arrogant and that armys didn't do this and that and how this Kpop group is more popular""

Army's: don't forget to downvote, then cry me a river.

The post on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DreamupMag/posts/2279940058699372) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DreamupMag/status/1022025183966711808).

I scanned the tiny article and took a pic of the big poster (a bit crappy... both the quality of the pic and the poster btw) and translated it.

&gt;BTSAlways stronger !Fans are waiting for their passage in France for months! The most popular K-pop band on the planet is coming soon! OMG!  
&gt;  
&gt;During their European tour, the seven boys will be in Paris on the October 19th and 20th at the AccorHotels Arena in Paris. An unique opportunity for their thousands of fans to see them on stage. Yes but ... the reality is a little less rosy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Deception and frustration  
&gt;  
&gt;In June, at the opening of the box office, the atmosphere was festive but quickly, the 70,000 fans had become disillusioned! Taken by storm from the opening at 9:00, the official sales websites were difficult to access. A few hours were enough to see the 40 000 places disappear! Which caused a lot of disappointments and frustrations. While browsing, even though they were present on the site even before the opening of the box office, many fans received error messages indicating a broken connection, a saturated site, a payment unavailable ... At the end of the day, when the sale was closed, their sadness quickly turned into anger. Untouchable tickets via the official network were being offered for sale at exorbitant prices on other sites. Twice, three times or even four times their original price! Already some places were expensive (300  the unit!), The amounts have reached peaks!  
&gt;  
&gt;An illegal system?  
&gt;  
&gt;Faced with the scale of the phenomenon, many condemned this injustice and scam! It must be said that there are robots capable of massively buying tickets and then sell them by making a huge profit. The system is illegal in France and liable to a fine ... But this is not enough to console the disappointed fans. Anyway, fans who will have the chance to attend one of these concerts rub their hands. Many will come from abroad especially for the occasion!  
&gt;  
&gt;Their new album, Love Yourself, was released on May 18th. It is a hit all over the world especially in the United States where a group of K-pop had never so far reached such a level of popularity. Real locomotive for Korean pop, the BTS are conquering the planet!  
&gt;  
&gt;Dream'up listen to their fans!  
&gt;  
&gt;Are you one of the lucky ones who had the chance to approach BTS? Have you seen them on stage, photographed them or are you a fan? Do not hesitate to send us a message to [tondreamupmag@gmail.com](mailto:tondreamupmag@gmail.com). We will publish in a next issue the best testimonials!  
&gt;  
&gt;""The tickets were sold out in a few hours! ""

There are a few mistakes, like saying that some places were 300 while the most expensive was the 250 VIP seat and they forgot to add ""Tear"" to the title of the album.

I didn't know there were BTS article on teen magazine here, but I guess there are sometimes? For example this [StarLight magazine](https://www.facebook.com/StarlightMag/posts/2214259515474532) which I didn't see in store (maybe I missed it). But yeah that's kinda funny!",10,78,False,self,,,,,

The design is so fricking cute but literally the only reason I'm selling it is because I finally had a reason to wear it and took it out of the bag after buying it like 3 months ago, only to find out 15 seconds after slipping the sleeves on that, oh wait, this is a female M sizing. (grabbed the chest to confirm and lol yup wish I tried this out in store)

shipping to usa, cost is the $63 I paid for it plus USPS first class shipping. please comment if interested or if you know anyone who is! can provide better pictures during daytime if needed.

So my best friend and I are going to the Oct. 3rd show. I saw a doc on this sub once with Korean shops near various concert venues and I'm really interested in stopping by Koreatown in Chicago if we can find it!

That being said, I know the line for the show is going to be huge and we want to be there asap to get merch. At this point, we plan to spend the whole day in Chicago, ending with the concert.

I'm also not sure about transportation yet. I'm okay with driving but I don't want to if I don't need to and I know it will get pricey. We could take the train but I've never done that before and have no idea how it works--how to pay, travel time, etc. Website wasn't helpful. Uber is also very expensive but it's not quite off the table yet.

What are your recommendations regarding when to arrive, if we should drive, how soon merch sells out, etc.? I kind of know the basics of what to bring thanks to the megathread (bless you, army).

Epilogue (Wonder) : Europhia by Jungkook
Love Yourself (Her) : Serendipity by Jimin
Love Yourself (Tear) : Singularity by Taehyung

Asides from that, Rap Line also already did intro as well (Suga did Nevermind, Jhope did Boy Meets Evil, RM i think he did one too i forgot)

Now their upcoming album Love Yourself (Answer) the intro this time should be given to Jin. I mean it should be like this. But somehow, the inner me is so scared that Jin will not get it since we know how bighit treat Jin....he always get the least lines/screentime...... IM SO SAD IF THAT REALLY HAPPENS i mean I wont be able to handle it if Jin doesn't have his own dam intro in the new album!!!!! T______T

 If we look at LY series as a  whole up to this point, we know that LYH dealt with the brighter aspects of love while LY-TEAR dealt with the darker aspects and how we should be true to ourselves first rather then fabricate ourselves for someone else. Now maybe answer will be about self acceptance and understanding that love is neither completely bright nor dark.

So to make the concluding album which track would be chosen from the series up to now and which would be left? (Assuming that the album would be like young forever without the remixes as this album is a conclusion of a whole series rather then just a repack of one album)
How will the new songs will be placed? Will it be at the end of the album or the beginning? 

Also what will those 7 new tracks include- Jintro- epiphany is going to be there most probably (not sure if it will be intro or a outro) and euphoria will be there too. The song left over from tear would also be included. We have got 4 more tracks, one of which I assume is going to be the title track. I am also hoping we get a banger (like fire or dope) from this album.

What do you guys think?

Based on how much we watch and know BTS members, what kind of friendship/relationship you want to have or would have with each member?

For me, it would be
RM: Big brother
I want namjoon to lead and guide me well haha I think life will be a bit less pressuring and hard with namjoon by our side since he could give me the advice that I'd need.
Suga: My brother's friend
Yep. He would be the cool friend of my brother and come to hang out at my house often and a mean one haha even though inside he is caring
Jimin : Boyfriend
He is flirting as hell and so caring! i think Jimin is a very soft and could be a bit feminine but at the same he is s1 that we could totally rely on
Jin: Husband (uWu)
Asides from Jin is my bias I think Jin is living his life totally opposite from me. He is very positive and I need that kind of energy for me. Since I am quite pessimistic, Jin would help not to get over anxious and live life in the moment and not overly worried about what to come. 
Jungkook: He looks like someone from my class and I would have a totally one sided crush on him! The kind of guy that is perfect at everything and I could only just admire him from afar.
V &amp; Jhope: We would be best friend! I think I would get along with them the most if we are being friend. We would be a crazy and loud gang Im sure! 
I can imagine Taehyung drag us to do sth that Jhope is super scared to do and I would be in the middle wanting to do it a bit and scared of it a bit.

That's for me. What's about u guys?",40,9,False,self,,,,,

This was around the time when work and exam pressures were pilling up at school and I thought I would try and be a diligent student and remove other distractions. Another reason was that I thought the more I interacted with BTS related things the sooner I wouldn't be into them anymore, I thought taking a break would avoid that. I also wanted to avoid become an overly obsessive fan, because they scared me and also really made me cringe (I mean some of them still do). The thing was that anxiety is such an issue in my life and all of the other pressures coming at me were only making it worse. I ended up breaking my hiatus after only a week because I needed a means of escape. That was the reason for breaking it at first but I then made a realisation: watching and listening to BTS calmed me and made me happy. It suddenly seemed silly to try and take a way a source of happiness from my life. BTS really has helped me through this tough year - sometimes I really wish I could just give them a thank you gift - and in the end I don't really want to stop listening to them regardless of how I will feel about them in the future and whether it will make me seem like and overly obsessive fan, because right now they make me very happy and thats really all that matters right now.",2,8,False,self,,,,,

My personal favorites so far are Jimin singing part of Serendipity,  Jungkook's lip syncing, Taehyung's ""Someone Like You"" cover, all the recent Prom Party performances (although, they took down Jikook's performance ), and the dance practices of ""Just One Day"" (Appeal Version) where Tae cannot stop giggling and ""War of Hormone"" (Real War Version) where they act like a bunch of dorks.

We've received a lot of rude comments from other ARMYs on Twitter, being called ""selfish"" ""entitled"" ""fan, not an ARMY"". Big accounts have ignored our DMs but then indirectly talked crap about us in their tweets saying ""stream to get a date/petitions don't work"" (But Florida is already within the top streaming states). So it's been rough for us.

So in short, we want to buy a small ad to better promote our campaign but we really need donations. Could Reddit ARMYs please help us with this? We can't do it on our own, even if it's like $1 it'll help. Please help us out.
