In a recent [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9bxyfq/does_anyone_wish_they_had_friendsknew_people/) on the sub so many of you talked about the pains of not knowing any other ARMY or even kpop listeners in your cities, which is disappointing. I posed the idea of organizing major city meetups across the country (world?) for all of you out there and seemed to get a good response! So, I'd like to make this happen, especially with tour season at our doorstep! As u/marrimar pointed out, ""it would be great to have a regular monthly meet up for Dinner and Run eps, listening parties or fun stuff like doing an Escape room with fellow ARMYs, learn choreography, take a pottery class or other BTS-inspired activities on the regular.""

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, we can do whatever we want! But I think one of the important things with this is making sure that it is an all-ages, all gender event. It seems people are sometimes deterred from talking about their love for BTS if they are either a guy or older than other ARMYs, or whatever! But we shouldn't have to worry about being passionate for something that is unique and different.

&amp;#x200B;

So first, is this something that you would be interested in? 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, in order to make sure it actually happens, we should be as organized as possible, which, knowing this sub, is easily possible! I think the best course of action is as follows:

\-to find people who are willing to take charge of organizing an event for their respective city: and thus I extend the question to you all; would you want to help organize a meet-up for your city? (I'm in Chicago and would love to do so) Also keep in mind, the meet-up will only be as good as the organizer... If you aren't a great texter and respond a day late to everything, then maybe you shouldn't organize a meet-up, hehe

\-create a group chat with organizers to brainstorm, create dates, and plan a course of action for advertising the meet-ups on the sub (I think centralized organization is best, but I'd love to hear other ideas if you disagree!) 

\-If mods would like to help co-ordinate (which would help the visibility of this a lot!), I'd love to do so. And they may have some experience with doing something like this that I don't

\-Go about advertising the event (likely posting on facebook and on the sub -probably the best way to do this is to make a ""megathread"" with all the planned dates for meet-ups for every city, rather than scattering posts for individual cities)

&amp;#x200B;

That's about all I got for this. Please give suggestions if you have them! So, I suppose the course of action now is to gauge interest on here. If this post gets enough traction, I'll PM all of you willing to organize for your city and create a group chat. We can then go from there.  (Note that for LA, it's too late to plan a meet-up FOR the concert, if that is something we end up planning. Fort Worth  (9/15) might be fine. New York and Chicago will definitely be fine though)",0,1,False,self,,,,,

On that note, it's now time to kick off the birthdays season, starting with our September boys, JK &amp; RM!  We know it's a bit late for our birthday messages, but the BTS Projects Team decided to let the concert and comeback activities be our subreddit's focus first. In any case, our letters will be there to cheer them on as soon as they get back from their world tour.

&amp;nbsp;

Since the subreddit has grown so much since the last birthday projects, a short recap for the new members:

&gt; The birthday books are a collection of fan messages and fan art created by our subreddit as a small way to show our support and love for BTS. To date, our community has raised over $1,890 USD for various charities, including the Love Myself campaign. See [all previous projects here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/projects#wiki_eng).

&amp;nbsp;

# WHAT'S NEW THIS TIME?

As some of you may know, earlier this year, Big Hit announced they would no longer be accepting gifts. Unfortunately, [our birthday books fell under the ""gifts"" category](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7u94me/fanclub_manager_rbangtan_books_classified_as_gifts/) so we had to make some changes moving forward:

- **FORMAT** Instead of birthday books, we'll be printing birthday pamphlets for out letter compilation. We're still finalising the actual format of these pamphlets, but [here's a few of our ideas](https://imgur.com/a/Yl8dQSl).

- **MESSAGE LIMITS** To ensure that we can fit as much submissions as possible, we're limiting messages to 500 characters and 1 photo per participant.

- **SUBMISSION FORMS** The BTS Projects Team has made a custom Google Script for your submissions. In order to access the submission forms, click 'Trust App'. We promise we did not code anything malicious.

&amp;nbsp;

Yup, that's basically it! So without further ado, here are our September birthday projects:

&amp;nbsp;

**JK's Birthday Project theme: EUPHORIA**

Share art, photos, words, moments, or events that gave/give you happiness. These things may or may not be related to JK/BTS (i.e. they could be personal things that never fail to uplift your mood).

&amp;nbsp;

**RM's Birthday Project theme: LOVE**

Send in any art, photos, words, moments, or events that make your heart beat! These things may or may not be related to RM/BTS (i.e. they could be how you show your love through simple ways).

&amp;nbsp;

**SUBMISSION FORMS **

##[**SEND JK'S BIRTHDAY SUBMISSIONS HERE**](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzZ6ZeOR-gKtEObMdb15NezBfj_aX_sN5ogyNgIJY5YlfNIw7VF/exec)

##[**SEND RM'S BIRTHDAY SUBMISSIONS HERE**](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyRcim3WLVtAeV-vLA_8xfpTEv5U0DYUNPF9lcQO-AoG8Ssa6w/exec)

&amp;nbsp;

**GUIDELINES **

&gt; - The **theme is optional**; you can still send in normal letters and photos/art.
&gt;
&gt; - Only the message and credit fields are required. **After clicking 'Submit', please wait for the confirmation screen to appear to ensure that your submission is properly saved.**

&amp;nbsp;

**MESSAGE SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - You are allowed **1 message**.
&gt;
&gt; - Please limit your message to **500 characters** (about 80 words, or a really small paragraph).
&gt;
&gt; - **No inappropriate messages**. If it doesn't follow the subreddit rules, we WILL remove it.

&amp;nbsp;

**FAN ART / PHOTO SUBMISSIONS **

&gt; - Please include **self created** artworks and photographs only.
&gt;
&gt; - We recommend that the files should have a resolution of **at least 300 dpi**. This goes for photos, and digital or scanned fan art.
&gt;
&gt; - You are allowed **1 photo per submission**. Please, no photo collages. We want your photos to print clearly and beautifully so the boys can appreciate them.
 
&amp;nbsp;

# CHARITY

- For both projects, we will be donating to the BTS and UNICEF [Love Myself campaign](http://www.unicef.or.kr/donation/en/index.asp). You may opt to donate through [the BTS Projects Team's PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs). Don't forget to specify how we should credit you in the comment section of the transaction.

- If you would prefer to donate directly to the Love Myself campaign, but would like your donation to count under our subreddit's running total, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYzsA-58zbKmBm1B8B7sdyM1adGfRjq3jBvNf1OMXnvzr_VA/viewform?usp=sf_link) after donating. We will include you in the project credits as well.
 
&amp;nbsp;

# EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **MESSAGE SUBMISSIONS will close at September 12, 11:59PM CST / September 13, 1:59PM KST**. You can use this [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to find out the exact date and time submissions close for you.

- We plan on sending the project by the end of September. We will be accepting charity donations until around September 21, 11:59 KST. Printing and shipping costs will be shouldered by the coordinators, but we will appreciate extra funds to cover these two projects. So, if you would like to help us cover printing and shipping, you can send it to us through [the team's PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs).

- We want to be responsible with your money, and allocate it to the appropriate project, so please don't forget to specify the amount, e.g. ""$5 for charity and $5 for printing and shipping"" in the notes. To clarify, the PayPal linked above is the same PayPal used for receiving donations. Also, if any money set aside for covering printing and shipping costs remain after the book has been ordered, we will put the remaining balance towards the charity donation.

&amp;nbsp;

# SUMMARY

- **^NEW!** Birthday Pamphlets instead of books
- **^NEW!** 1 message + 1 photo per participant

- Charity donations close **September 21, 11:59PM CST / September 22, 1:59PM KST**.

&amp;nbsp;

Please let us know if you have any clarifications or suggestions. We may be able to incorporate your ideas into the next birthday projects. Meanwhile, we will be expecting your JK/RM submissions! 

&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely, 

The BTS Projects Team

Ok so recently I read a comment on here suggesting that some ARMYs really want to meet other ARMYs near them or don't know where to find any and that someone should make an ARMY locator app.

I thought a lot about this realizing I know only ARMYs online as much as I will certainly make friends with fellow ARMYs at Citi Field on 10/6. But once that show is over, I go back to feeling like a lone ARMY in my area once again.

I brought this up to another ARMY last night who was all over the idea.

Here is what I propose. You see, there's so many of us ARMYs out there that we may not know arw ARMYs, family. That is unless you hear someone playing BTS' music or wearing a shirt, etc. So you could be in a mall and 20 other ARMYs are there and you would never know. I mean, I know I feel like the only one, but in a city of over 30,000 people, there has to be another ARMY right? Just like Earth can't be the only planet with life, there has to be ARMYs everywhere.

Imagine if you could turn on an app and find ARMYs nearby and then build new friendships in the name of BTS. Sure we all feel like a family already, but imagine actually have a friend or 10 to stan with regularly when no one else around you understands. Imagine having a birthday party for our boys with other fans. Imagine celebrating ARMY Day with other ARMYs, not just online. Imagine celebrating Debut Day by blasting BTS all day, but not alone in your joy and silliness..

Well let's do it! I have thought into this app quite a bit since the last I thought about it because the more I talked about it, the more I wanted it. Buttttt I want this to be Big Hit officially licensed app. I say this because I saw with great sadness what happened to To The Edge Of The Sky as those devs tried to get Big Hit to recognize their game only to get a cease and desist letter telling them legal action would be taken if the devs didnt remove likenesses of BTS members from their game. They complied with Big Hit's request and the game now has different looking characters.

I feel without this being some type of officially licensed app it could run the risk of the same fate as TTEOTS if we tried to use any images to make it look great for everyone. So, instead of finding a dev to make it and hope for Big Hit's approval, I say we generate a lot of interest and buzz with a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/big-hit-entertainment-bts-army-finder-app?recruiter=626582471&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_term=Search%3ESAP%3EUS%3ENonBrand-Tier%201%3EDiscovery%3EExact) signed by ARMYs and when there's enough support, I have set to contact Big Hit as well as the creators behind the highly anticipated BTS app where we can manage the boys. If Big Hit wont listen to me, then maybe those devs will like this idea and the support behind it to take it to Big Hit themselves.

Now here is where I need your help fellow ARMYs.


Firstly, if you think this is a good idea where we can find other ARMYs around us to connect with, sign [this petition!!](https://www.change.org/p/big-hit-entertainment-bts-army-finder-app?recruiter=626582471&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_term=Search%3ESAP%3EUS%3ENonBrand-Tier%201%3EDiscovery%3EExact)

I know a few ARMYs that will, but there's ARMYs all over the world! 

Secondly, I would hope for some input or feedback about this idea! Leave any options or thoughts in the comments.

And finally, if an app like this did exist, what would you want to see it have? Maybe an ""add friends"" feature? A chat feature? Profile customization/options? Language options? Etc. It can be anything.

Also, something else that was talked about in my discussion is ARMY verification. I find this worthy of discussion because Anti's do exist and I wouldn't want to put anyone in danger because someone who isn't an ARMY or faking an identity to get in contact with fellow ARMYs especially since many ARMYs are pre teens, teens, or young adults. I myself am almost 30 and feel very protective over younger ARMYs so I definitely want to have their best interests at heart. 

*But* I see another side of the verification too. For me personally being a US based ARMY I still, to this day, have issues passing the quiz on fancafe because I'm not good at reading Korean or writing responses in hangul so I feel the struggle with their verification process. However, I understand the meaning behind it to weed out non-fans and maintain the exclusivity to ARMYs. 

With that being said, what are your opinions on a verification process and if you think there should be one, how would you like to see it done? 

*I personally agree with having a verification process or even a small like 9.99 cost for it or something like that. I would hope though if it did cost for access that it would be donated to causes BTS supports.*",4,0,False,self,,,,,

I really wish BigHit would give them a proper vocal instructor, especially now since they're all pretty much done with puberty and their voices have settled. They already sound so good, imagine how much better they would sound if they could reach their full potential.

For some reason, a lot of fans seem to take this as an insult, but it's not. Yes, they're beginning to use their voices in parts of songs where they're most suited for it. Taehyung isn't constantly growling, Jimin isn't always doing the insanely high notes, Jin is getting more lines, etc. We all have our own opinions on who's the weakest singer or who is the most misused and so on, but honestly, it doesn't matter because there are places where each of them struggle. I love Stigma, but it pains me to watch Taehyung strain to reach that high note. It can't be easy for him being the only baritone in a group of tenors. Jimin has a lot of throat and tongue tension and his confidence issues with his voice is also holding him back. Jin can reach really high notes as we've heard in ""Crystal Snow"" and ""Awake"", but just because you can doesn't mean you should. Jungkook is very breathy and I can't tell if it's just because of a stylized vocal choice or because of improper technique.

Like, I think a lot of people fail to realize that the technicalities of singing and noting that the vocal line aren't very good technical singers isn't pretentious sandbagging. It doesn't matter if you've been singing for a day or for half of your life. Everyone needs a teacher if they're going to be singing for a living. Broadway performers do eight shows a week and practice for hours on end and they still need training and coaching.

They all have very gorgeous and unique voices, and we want them to be the best they can be, but above all else, sing with proper placement and breathing because they're going to be doing some real damage to their voices that can be irreversible.

I know BigHit has claimed in the past that having a teacher travel with them would be too hard, but I don't believe that for a second. If they can have a staff with makeup artists, hair, stylists, costumers, security, etc. they can take one more person.",7,3,False,self,,,,,

does it ever feel kind of ostracising where most of the fandom arent the same? or do you feel insecure/out of place being one of the few guys and if there are other guys they are straight so you still can't fully relate. for example if you are attracted to them the other people also attracted to them are primarily women.

At the end of August and our #DreamWithJungkook campaign, we raised over $3800 dollars from donors in over 45 countries for KKOOM, an organization that provides education and support to orphans in South Korea. More than 150 letters have already arrived to go to the kids that KKOOM supports and there are more in the mail!! According to our contact, every child at Samsungwon Orphanage and Emmanuel Children's Home will get a handwritten note. We also challenged ARMY at the end of the month to get 24 donations of $1 or more in 24 hours and if they did that, we would do the Idol Challenge. Well, ARMY came through and members of OneInAnARMY tried their best to do the challenge, proof  video \[here\]([https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1035774880283860992](https://twitter.com/OneInAnARMY/status/1035774880283860992))

For September, we are doing a birthday campaign for Namjoon called #RebuildWithNamjoon.  The organization we are partnering with, Gili Eco Trust, works to rebuild the coral reefs around the Gili Islands in Indonesia, as well as running waste management and education programs there. We choose to support Gili for Namjoon's birthday due to his love of nature, especially oceans and the creatures that live there.  However-after reaching out the organization's founder and having started planning- in early August, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake and subsequent aftershocks hit Lombok, another Indonesian island, and caused extreme damage to that island as well as the Gili islands. Therefore the funds raised this month will go not only to supporting Gili Eco Trust's programs, but also helping in local rebuilding efforts. 

Our fun extra activity this month is an environmentally themed bingo! There will be multiple bingo cards with tasks that benefit the environment on them. To go along with ARMY on their journey to help the environment, a fanartist, @numberjoon, was kind enough to draw us art of Namjoon for people to print out and color and take with them as they do the bingo activities if they want.

It could be a certain performance or video clip, a certain record broken, a single song released during this era that has become very special to you. It could also just be a personal memory or experience related to this era. Go with your instincts!

In my case:

- The LY: Wonder video. In my opinion, it is one of the most beautiful things BTS has ever produced. I still cant make heads or tails of the narrative at all but sometimes I think about that video and get transported into this little bittersweet internal reverie. Its just a gorgeous piece of film. 

- Sea. I remember listening to that song the first time with English lyrics pulled up on my phone and absolutely losing it. It was exactly what I needed at that moment in my life and Im not about to forget it anytime soon. 

- Very very personal here, but waiting in  the back wings of the MGM Grand Arena right before the start of the BBMAs. The atmosphere was so celebratory and triumphant and teeming with excitement for what we all knew was to come. The show was a blur but I remember that pre-show sense of deep pride and joy very clearly. It was amazing. ",30,98,False,self,,,,,

I feel sometimes out of place amongst ARMYs because in my mind I imagine all their fans are young, in their teens and 20s.  I also sometimes feel, because I have bery bad self-esteem, that maybe BTS would be embarrassed to have me as their fan, being as old as I am.  I know this isn't true because they have spoken about it before, but my low confidence still tries to sabotage me!

But I'd like to advise everyone attending that please be orderly and civil. Try not to cause too much trouble for Bighit and the boys. This is serious news and I'm sure people have read articles from a few months ago that death threats were made towards certain members, insinuating that horrific actions may be taken when the world tour begins in September.

So I would like to plead everyone to please be on the lookout for suspicious activity and movement when there is action around the boys. Sometimes the security has holes in it that *really* attentive people can exploit to get close to the boys and we need to prevent something like that from happening.

Anyway, have fun at the concerts! I know what's on my bucket list now.

Those who applied for the lottery, where do you log in to get to ""My Page"" in Lawson Ticket in order to see if you've actially won the lottery? (I know that it still hasn't been released, but it will basically be released tomorrow). I've tried logging in using both  WEB and  . However, I think I should be putting my information on the second one, and I believe I'm not part of the    .

On the second option, you are only supposed to fill your e-mail address, telephone number and password, but when I fill everything in, it tells me that one of them is incorrect. There is no way that the e-mail and the telephone number are wrong because I have already received a message from them and I literally copy pasted the number. The password should not be incorrect either because I am using the only four-letter password that I saved after doing all the application, but it doesn't seem to work.

Maybe I am doing this wrong and this is actually not the way to log in into ""My Page""? This was my first time applying for the lottery and using Lawson Ticket, and I applied for both Tokyo dates. I also used the same 4 number password for both of the tickets when applying. But I don't remember making an account (as the first option says). Either way I've tried logging in with ""my account"" somehow, but it doesn't seem to work either so I'm pretty sure I didn't make an account? I'm really confused and I can't properly remember how I did it when I applied for the lottery.

I would really appreciate it if somebody could help me with this, because I'm basically screwed if I am not able to log in into ""My Page...""

You cannot leave the dolby until the show ends at 7pm! Please don't be rude. Please read the instructions on your ticket. Have fun!!! You can go to restroom during commercial breaks. ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

But I personally don't feel that the things they do that he takes offense to is cultural appropriation at all. Can you guys give some input as to what you think about this? And also some things/examples to show him in order to get him to see the other side or at least give BTS a chance. He also says things like ""BTS prances around for little girls"" :| I've really had it up to \*here\* with this kind of stuff but I have no good comebacks because I don't fully understand the cultural appropriation bit myself

Has anything changed for you? Do you have any new appreciation or distaste for songs from Her and Tear? Do you wish for songs to be added or taken away from Answer? What do you think about the era as a whole? I'm really opinionated when it comes to my faves so I'm sorry for the wall of text lol:

&gt; If I'm Fine was released as a single in the UK I think it would do quite well, drum and bass is a UK chart friendly genre

&gt; I see way more Seesaw/Just Dance enthusiasts but Love is my favourite trivia, I like the transition from Love to Her a lot

&gt; Like a lot of BTS releases it took me a while to like Idol, the song and video combined were really overwhelming at first. Saying that, while it's not my favourite music video Tae really stood out

&gt; If you wear headphones you can hear Hobi's voice travelling side to side during the chorus of Just Dance. It sounds really nice and I've noticed that BTS likes using this effect a lot

&gt; I really like the album version of Epiphany, Jin did what he had to do on the track

&gt; The production on Serendipity and Singularity is outstanding

&gt; The sound effect in Just Dance's chorus sounds like a whiteboard being shaken

&gt; 134340 could have been a track on Dark and Wild

&gt;I don't get why people have a problem with Nicki's pants in the air line in Idol tbh 

***

**TLDR:** Answer and the Love Yourself series in general got a lot of mixed reviews but I think BTS continued to serve quality and we got a lot of great music, I would rather they continue to switch it up and grow as artists rather than giving us HYYH part 37374. I didn't like every single song from the series and hip hop Bangtan will always remain superior to me but honestly if they stayed doing just that people would probably complain that their music isn't evolving instead. If you are a stan you should know that they've been experimenting for a while now so idk why the mixture of genres on the recent releases are still a surprise to some. If you want a full hip hop project you're more likely to get it with something like RM2 imo.",106,134,False,self,,,,,

Because she is only like ""butts everywhere"". I don't expect art from her but I don't think she is good at entertainment either(at least for me)

I don't know so much about BTS, but I like to listen their songs because they are cute and enjoyable for me. And I believe that they are using ""I love myself"" word for a good reason, but with Nicki Minaj and all the American stuff, isn't that so fake?

It's not as bad as H&amp;M's ""women's power"" ad (because H&amp;M using too many ""powerful women"" as the cheap workers in the South Asia), but it is still lack of sincerity you know? It is like they are using ""loving ourselves"" just for getting more fame.

Fame, makeups, looks are important for businesses like BTS's or Nicki Minaj's, or for any entertaintment work, but actually sincerity is also important to me.

I don't know what will change with my opinion(probably nothing will change), but I just came here to say that I'm so sad, I was enjoying with BTS's songs since I think they were more ""sincere"" or something. The sincerity usually comes with a serious art and as an adult with a serious job, I was just bored of them and was listening some pop and now it's gone for me, thanks. (BrokenHearted)

First up, J-Hope. Brief disclaimer here that I dont know Korean, so my view might be a bit lacking. Compared to the other two rappers, J-Hopes lyrics tend to be very simple and straightforward. Its like a journal page when Suga and RMs are like short stories/poems. However, it suits him since he doesnt rely on lyrics to add depth to his songs, but his vocals. His current songs all have a very distinct personality to them  I would even say that for now he has the strongest style out of all three rappers (a complete opposite from old bangtan, lol). In terms of group work, Ive noticed that he now takes on the emotional role whereas Suga takes on the fun rhythmic role, which I find super interesting considering their past works. Hope World was a solid foundation, and I really want to see how he plans to grow his musical direction. Right now, he's doing good.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, Suga. Suga has been killing it exponentially. I originally thought that he would just venture forth his Agust D angst route and expand from there, but what he did was even riskier, and it goes without saying that it yielded fantastic results. Ill be lying if I said he didnt remind me of old J-Hope with all his singing and experimentation. Ironically, Agust D was created to release Suga from his idol boundaries, but today, it wouldve just restricted Sugas musical growth instead. When he mentioned through his interviews that he did not want to remain stagnant, I think this was what he was dwelling upon. Im glad that he did not hold on to that persona strongly, because Agust D fits better as an era than a persona. Now that he no longer limits himself to the rapper role, I am very excited to see what he will produce next. More vocals maybe?

&amp;#x200B;

As for RM I am a little conflicted. I feel like he is having trouble figuring out his style. Hes definitely experimenting, but theres a bit of a misalignment between his productions and his own songs. He is adaptable and definitely great at producing brilliant songs for other people, but when it comes to his own songs, I feel like he hasnt broken out of his comfort zone yet. I think the main issue is RM relies too much on lyrics. When hes producing songs for other people, he takes into account that he cant fit as much lyrics into the songs as his regular rap verse, so he focuses on building atmosphere through other aspects (see singularity and serendipity). When it comes to his songs, lyrics and word play might be one of his strongest aspects, but it also takes away emotion from the songs, thus making it lose flavor. However, I still enjoy his songs, and I'll have to wait for his mixtape in order to get a better idea of his current style.

494,bangtan,t5_2zqih,2018-9-10,2018,9,10,15,9ekkqb,self.bangtan,My take on all the controversy surrounding 88rising,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/9ekkqb/my_take_on_all_the_controversy_surrounding/,SushiBoi2,1536562498,"I am aware that they posted a shippy video of BTS and other k-pop boy groups, and that the comments on them were homophobic.

My opinion on 88rising:

I think that they are doing a great job making Asian artists be known in North America (other than ultra-produced k-pop). They are also a very new record label/company and they are also very casual about what they post on social media. They arent very mature as a company yet, and dont seem to know what can be controversial and how to fix things afterwards. Creatively, I love everything they and their artists do. I love all the artists on the label. I also love k-pop, but mainly for the music side of things. It probably wasnt the best idea to post a video compilation making people who might not be gay, and putting them in a light where they look like something they might not be. Most of these I assume were from dare or challenge videos where the loser has to do something that they dont want to do (or giving a quick peck on the cheek as Fanservice).

My opinion on the homophobic comments:

I think that why the comments are so immature is because 88rising hosts quite a few new and rising artists that not a lot of people know about. Most k-pop on the other hand, is different where they have the strongest fanbases out of anyone. K-pop is also produced by a massive amount of people to make it the most appealing to everyone. Its kinda like how hipsters hate everything popular. The 88rising fans dont know enough about k-pop, other than what they see on the internet, which are the sometimes extreme fanbases, pretty boys, and how theyre taking over Asian music. They most likely see these shippy videos, and automatically try to insult them based on the little information that they have.

Another reason that they could be so immature is because one of the artists on 88rising; Joji, used to have a YouTube channel called Filthy Frank where he would post offensive and immature humour. A lot of the fans from Filthy Frank moved onto Joji and the 88rising label. Since they followed for the offensive humour, theyre trying to be edgy, to get rid of any k-pop relations with 88rising. The actual fanbase of 88rising, is also pretty young since thats the audience that theyre trying to get anyway.

In conclusion, I love k-pop, BTS, and 88rising, and I hope that the homophobic comments were from a vocal minority. A lot of other comments that I read were very supportive of a possible collab between the 2. Obviously it could be clout chasing on 88risings side, but some of the artists seem genuinely excited about getting recognized by BTS (Joji, Rich Brian, Higher Brothers). Ive watched every interview related to 88rising and their artists, and they all seem like genuinely nice people. I think they just got too excited from the new attention, and werent thinking straight.

Besides, Lisa from Blackpink, Jackson from GOT7, and RM of BTS, all individually shared music from 88rising out of their own volition. Its kinda hard to ignore the overlap between the 2 different fanbases.

P.s. The controversial video was posted by the 88rising label social media, so please stop blaming it on a specific person from the label. We dont know who it was, (it could be anyone from the company), and blaming it on a single person doesnt help. The truth is that they should be more careful with what they post in the future.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

I've had a really crap couple of years, and I'm nowhere near close to being recovered from illness, depression etc etc.  When I heard BTS I'm Fine for the first time I loved it. I loved how they played the long game and made the two songs a kind of story arc.  The last couple of weeks and months I've had a set back in my recovery and I feel wretched pretty much all the time.  Tonight, I was listening to BTS and I'm Fine came on and I cried my eyes out because I'm not fine, but I would give anything to be able to say I'm Fine and really mean it.

It got me thinking, I can't be the only ARMY who isn't fine, and I just wanted to say to myself and to all of us that it's ok to not be fine.  There's no pressure to have it all together and no pressure to be just fine.  Right now I'm still in Save Me mode, but that doesn't mean I'll never be able to say I'm Fine.

I was supposed to stay at the Hamilton Plaza Hotel for the BTS concert in Hamilton Canada but they just contacted me to tell me this :

&amp;#x200B;

""Unfortunately  I am contacting you with some unpleasant information. Ownership has  decided to take the hotel in a different direction and as such we no  longer have availability for guest rooms after September 16, 2018. Unfortunately we  will not be able to honour any reservations after September 16th, 2018. All other reservations after this date will be cancelled. We apologize for any inconveniences this might cause. ""

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I suffer from anxiety. I was already stressed that I had to travel to another province and that I was going alone too but now my anxiety is killing me. I booked this room 4 months in advance and I get a ONE WEEK notice. This is ridiculous and now of course eveything is booked in Hamilton. 

&amp;#x200B;

I booked another hotel room but it's 40 minutes from the venue so I guess I will have to rent a car but driving is one of the thing that gets me the most anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

Fellow ARMYs with anxiety, what do you do to help reduce your anxiety for the concert?

The bulletproof boy band performed on America's Got Talent, the popular audition program of NBC, which was broadcasted at 8:00 pm on December 12 (local time).   


On this day, the bulletproof boy band led the audience's explosive reaction by showing the new album title track ""IDOL"" live. With the overwhelming performances of the Bangladeshi boys' unique energy and the fierce cries of many fans who followed the 'IDOL' song, they focused on the viewers of the world.   


Tyra Banks, who is in charge of the program, immediately followed the stage of the bulletproof boy band, ""It's the best hit band in the world"" IDOL ""stage,"" he said. ""The bulletproof boy band is currently on a 'LOVE YOURSELF' tour.""   


Earlier in the day, the '2018 American Music Awards' said through official YouTube live streaming that Bangladeshi boys were nominated for the FAVORITE SOCIAL ARTIST category.   


The Bangladeshi boy band has been nominated for the first time this year for the American Music Awards and is the only Korean singer.

As we already had a survivor series for Love Yourself  'Her' and Love Yourself  'Tear', this series will only feature new songs from Love Yourself  'Answer'. Remixes and extended versions are considered part of the original songs and will not be included. I am considering an era championship series in the future though if anyone's interested :)

# Game Rules

Rules are the same as the previous Love Yourself  'Tear' survivor series. I will post an official feedback poll during the final round to check-in on how the sub feels about how this series went.

* As the name suggests, we will choose one song to eliminate each round until there is one surviving song. Please vote **ONCE** for the song you want **ELIMINATED** in each poll.
* You are required to **login into your Google account** in order to vote (i.e. to limit one vote per login). Your email address will not be recorded. I (and everyone else) will not see your email address or your specific vote.
* Choose wisely! **Your vote is final** and cannot be changed.
* I will post a new poll every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. The previous round will be closed and the results given when the new poll is posted.
* Please don't cheat (or troll)! Remember, there is no ""right"" answer; everyone has different emotional connections and musical preferences :)

# Round 1: Please vote [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1QjaGTLVPj97R0KNBrW9iGpcBm1rRaAJhbuaOYNO71MW2pA/viewform)

You can view the current response summary by clicking on the ""[See previous responses](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1QjaGTLVPj97R0KNBrW9iGpcBm1rRaAJhbuaOYNO71MW2pA/viewanalytics)"" link after you vote. You can see what song each pie slice stands for by (for PC) hovering above each pie slice or (for mobile) tapping on the song in the legend list and looking at what slice is outlined.

Please feel free to give me any feedback or contact me regarding any concerns (either commenting below or directly messaging me) :)

# Upcoming Survivor Series

These are upcoming survivor series I'm planning. Order is from confirmed to tentative. I will send out a survey later for the tentative ones. Feel free to give feedback on any of these :)

* Mixtape Series
   * RM
   * Agust D
   * Hope World
* Hair Color Series
   * Will be posted in between the more ""official content"" series.
   * Each member will have their own poll, and each poll will be played one at a time in official fan chant order to give each member 100% of our attention (e.g. I will post Namjoon's after LY: Answer is complete).
   * [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UD-Wc3jKmgCu6kALrsUyvBErDM6bOUabchNZsEJUZ4M) is the current list of hair colors (e.g. Green will include all shades/styles of green. Highlights are part of both categories). Please let me know if I'm missing any.
* Award Show Performances (or any performances that differ significantly from their official choreography)
* Run / Gayo Vlive episodes
* Era
* Face Yourself Album Original Japanese Songs OR All Albums Original Japanese Songs
* Era Championship Series (i.e. top 3 songs from each series per era). For example, Love Yourself series (top 3 songs from Her, Tear, and Answer).
* Re-do of previous albums
* Covers, Unofficial Songs
* Remixes",177,98,False,self,,,,,

I'm a long time lurker but decided to write my first post because I was hoping for reassurance/explanation.  I apologize to the mods if this is not an appropriate post (feel free to delete if so) - wasn't sure if this is allowed... 

It's regarding my concern about Big Hit's decision to work with *that Japanese producer*  (won't say his name because I don't want to associate them together) on their upcoming Japanese album. I know that this is a huge issue among K-Army right now. I saw the endless posts on the fancafe, upset tweets from K-Army, naver comments, etc., pleading with Bang PD and BH to cancel this. I even saw that one K-army called BH 60+ times. But so far, there hasn't been a response/""feedback"" from BH and everyone is very angry. Instead, they released an article yesterday about the global auditions, but the comments on that particular article were all about this issue and people were extremely mad. (By the way, I don't want to link any of these articles because again, I don't want to give clicks and associate them with our boys). 

I know some (or most?) I-Army believe we should stay out of this and let K-Army handle this. But though I'm an I-Army, I'm also a Korean American who lived part of my life in Korea, and this whole issue is making me nervous and upset. I noticed that the Naver and Daum searches linked with our boys are now related to this issue. The Korean GP, who are generally very tough against idols as is, are noticing. I've seen how this has affected other stars such as Steven Yeun and Tiffany, etc. 

How are you all coping with this? Do you think it's realistic for me to expect BH to pull this collab? I understand it's a lot at stake to cancel this but our boys always had to go against the odds, and I feel that BH should trust us to continue to help them rise despite whatever falling out they may have with the Japan side after this...

[DO YOU SEE THIS FREAKING PICTURE? HOW THE F\*\*K CAN YOU CHOOSE A BIAS? \(Sorry for minor rant\)](https://i.redd.it/slckl96hw8m11.jpg)

I have often wonder whether or not it is important, hence, why I put this question out for ARMYS. I do fear that ARMYS with a Singular Bias, tend to often neglect/don't care for the rest of the members and I really do not like that. If you stan BTS and are part of the ARMY, you have to care and love each member. Anyone, I do know many fans who do have biases, and love the other members. Just so no one thinks I am trying to diss any Singular Bias Stans.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally am a Seven Member Stan. The biggest reason I am such, is because I believe 

1. Each individual member of BTS is unique and incomparable to each other. 
2. Due to that uniques, they make this beautiful bond and group where when one member is gone, you sense a hole is missing 
3. Finally, IT IS SO FREAKING HARD TO PICK ONE MEMBER. They are freaking beautiful sweetheart creatures, how could anyone choose?

ANYWAY WHICH ONE ARE YOU? AND LIST THE REASONS!

I'm one of K-army, and I'm here to explain K army's viewpoint is in disagreement by sites. Since currently K community is becoming battle field and some I army here misunderstood K army's viewpoint, I decided to explain that Not all K army think boycotting or asking apology is valid on this issue. And I hope you understand that the K army is currently so huge that it is hard to shape one position on behalf of them by controlling themsleves.


1. DCincide.

This has been place where trolls's paradise since anybody can readily write the post whatever it is. However, main columns exists and never swayed by trolls considering main post sections(). Even though their wording is usually rough and rude, when important things is needed for them, they got together rationally than any other communites. For instance, it was them who created '(i lovelies)' nickname and promote about it how was this name created via twitter and many other sites.

Speaking of the recent issue, they think boycotting is too much not to mention asking apology to BH. They are currently very mad at other K army who did boycotting and currently ask apology spamming on the Fan cafe. 

Since they've faced so many types of trolls(even they easily cought one Bigbang fan who pretended to be a real K army and saying that she or he was so disappointed of this issue that she or he does not want to be a fan of BTS anymore in the comment section of Melon site),  they think those who asking apology in the fan cafe is from other antis pretending to army to make conflicts among ARMY.(intended K army vs I army) They think that these anties showed a typical pattern by toxic Exo fans so they are so frustrated how many other K army and I army are swayed and arguing each other.

However, rest of other K army community tend to consider them as uneducated monsters due to their rough wordings cultures (But this rough wording culture is one of features for All DCincide sections.)


2. Daum cafes(except fan cafe), thekoo, instiz etc (female oriented sites)

They were emotionally swayed by this issue and their lacking English ablity cuased many misunderstandings a lot for I Army. Especially, there is one daum cafe called 'Woman Generation' which created Megalian(problematic radical feminism). This WG is known for very nortorious among Korean GP and Exo fans are majority in this. The funny thing is boycotting BTS announcement(image) is formed by this cafe. WG users are so influential that they spreaded this postition to other daum cafes and many other communties not to mention twitter. (This is why DC K army user think some trolls from other fans are engaged in this issue.)



3. BTS fan talk section in Nate pann 

They are mixed. They've been rational (one example is that they wrote quite long rational reasonable passages to defend I army when other fans accused I Army as the worst in the Nate Pann). but for this issue, they were quite very emotional when it comes to deal with I army. Some think boycotting was valid not to be ignored by BH, the other wasn't. For now, they currently think that Asking apology is inappropriate. They admitted that they were quite unlogical and emotional dealing with issue and communicating with I army and and thet are discussing how they can be more improved from now on.



4. Official daum fan cafe and Twitter

I've put together a survey that investigates who is attracted to which members and why. It's something that's really fascinated me about the fandom since I'm totally new to stanning a group. I've noticed some trends related to my own biases, but that could be my own confirmation bias for all I know! 

I'll be looking at demographics, what initially attracted you, why you stayed, and whether people are more likely to co-bias certain members or have particular bias-wreckers. I plan on collecting the info and then publishing the results here if I get enough responses. This is not a popularity survey - individual member popularity is not going to be examined.

Feel free to share with the link with anyone who is interested!

#Please read before taking survey

* If you have two biases you will have to complete it once for each member, unfortunately. This is kind of a pain because only the answers to the first section of the survey are affected.You'll have to input demographic information again. Sorry everyone! I have two biases myself so I know the pain. If you fill out the typed answer field for sections 1 and 2 I'd advise copy-pasting them so you don't have to type it out twice.
* There is an option for ""no bias"". I labelled it as such to avoid the confusion that results when ""OT7"" is used. 
* When you can select more than one option please try not to do too many. The more options that you select the less precise the survey is. It's understandable if you like you bias for many reasons, though!

Thanks everyone, have at it!

First things first, what can i expect at the concert? I understand most of the concert etiquette to merch but I'm talking performance wise. Are they singing their japanese or korean albums? I know front to back the entire K-album but not so much their J-album so I would need to brush that up!

Also, what about army bombs? The V3 is REALLY EXPENSIVE and I blew up a lot of money paying for my Japan trip and joining the BTS Japan Fanclub haha. So I was wondering if i should buy V2 (which is more affordable) or just not rock up with an army bomb? Especially since V2 and V3 are so different... Opinions?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm back again after some time to share another poem with you all. I'm a bit unsure of the reception of this poem, it has been met with a lot of awkward silences that I did not know how to interpret, haha.... I tend to hide a lot of BTS-related references in my poetry that non-armys never pick up on, so when I share my writing with an audience that I know will pick up on these hidden clues, it feels more special to me.

This is a poem I've been meaning to share for quite a while now but I kept on getting busy with life, so I had to put it on hold.  Many people got in touch with me privately after reading my last poem. I wasn't expecting such personal conversations with other fellow armys, but I'm really grateful that I was able to become even closer to the fandom through the simple act of sharing a poem. 

I'm aware that we have some writers present on our sub. I hope me sharing my writing here encourages other writers to share their BTS-related writings too, so that we can all further enrich this sub with our creativity! 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, enough of my preamble, here's the poem:

&amp;nbsp;

**The Sad Heart of Ruth**

&amp;nbsp;

I saw a woman sitting on the bus

reading a poetry book,

when abruptly

she looked up from the page

to implore the View outside the window

to give her something.

&amp;nbsp;


Instead, the View glibly retorted:

Tell me, what behooves you?

She shook her head and insisted,

Give me something, *something*

and stared hard at the View.

&amp;nbsp;

How was the View like, you might ask?

Probably the very sunny and windy type

where flowers of snowfall are swarming the air around like tulle;

from the trees, the contrails, peoples laughter

and they pester your eyes ticklingly.

&amp;nbsp;

There were wet petals in her eyes

fallen and trodden on by footsteps in the rain;

her eyes were deflowering

because today was such a good day,

because it had been a while since she had such a good day.

&amp;nbsp;

I approached her with misplaced care,

I know were all asking questions here so Im sorry to ask one more,

but, are you happy?

She turned towards me, scarified,

couldn't stop herself from giving a short laugh.

&amp;nbsp;

Its not as simple as that

&amp;nbsp;

I think its the small but certain things that help,

the unwavering kind, you know

&amp;nbsp;

like recalling his heart-shaped smile

while lying down on a grassy hill after a long days work.

Or this right here! Crying on a bus reading poetry.

After all how far could the ride last without poetry?

Or unknowingly finding hazelnut in a chocolate croissant

bought to not let the cashier down.

&amp;nbsp;

But lately

wrists. Wrists have been on my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

It was when she persistently grasped my wrists with both her hands

as if to measure the life within these thin, translucent, jade roots,

saying, with barely restrained intimation, *I want to take you away!*

&amp;nbsp;

That night I dreamt

he faintly clasped my wrist

as if enveloping a lost voice in hodden grey,

to say he fully accepts all that is me

and wants to protect it.

&amp;nbsp;

The next day

the bus hit hard on the brakes

and I rashly clutched a flailing passengers wrist

to help them up.

&amp;nbsp;

I puzzled then

what is it about *wrists*,

also, am I something to be taken away or protected?

&amp;nbsp;

She blinked all of a sudden and her narration

perished into powdered blanket flowers.

I tried nodding and smiling along

but my eyes widened in panic

and my jaws began to hurt.

&amp;nbsp;

I had to get off the bus.

I decided to walk the rest of the way home.

&amp;nbsp;

It began to drizzle (of course) and I covered my face in anguish;

I had unwittingly glimpsed

into her View and seen her wrists were broken.

But she seemed all the more beautiful to me

with those wispy, vermillion tendrils on her wrists

in an immaculate disarray.

&amp;nbsp;

I looked behind as the buss aged hum resounded away reassuringly;

&amp;nbsp;

it was a departure from a spot in time

I kept on wanting to search for a forgotten ticket in my pocket

but I had no pockets to begin with

did the blue Giovanni* feel this distraught when he had to leave?

&amp;nbsp;

I looked above at the clustering clouds covering the primrose way.

&amp;nbsp;

What immortal hand or eye

could paint thy fearful symmetry

O Light, hiding behind these flamingo clouds?

*note: I have a feeling this reference might go over many people's heads, so far no one I showed this poem to has picked up on it. This is the name of the protagonist from the story ['Night of the Galactic Railroad'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_on_the_Galactic_Railroad) by Miyazawa Kenji (1932).
___

Long-story short, things happened and my poem got chosen to be published for ARMY Magazine's RM bday issue. Here's the [page in the magazine with my poem](https://imgur.com/9gsvFFt). I left an author's note there in case it helps with some of the references. My poetry tends to be loaded with those. 

If you have a look at the page, the magazine's designer had their own interpretation of my poem and connected it with RM's LY Highlight Reels, which I thought was really interesting! Originally I had no such intention, my recent writing has been taking on a very abstract turn, so the narrator in the poem is actually genderless, I purposely did not want to assign any gender to the narrator. But I think that's the great thing about interpretation, everyone has their own take on things. So the designer's interpretation was a pleasant surprise to me.

Anyways, let me know what you think of this poem. I'd be happy to answer any curious questions . Although I'll try not to go too much into detail, since I like to keep things open-ended for my readers so that they could come to their own conclusions.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, pls. do check out ARMY magazine's publications! Pls. give them lots of love and feedback on their [twitter account](https://twitter.com/ARMYMAGofficial). They're still a very new team (they just released their [2nd issue](http://joom.ag/WYia)). Here's a link to their [1st issue](http://joom.ag/ixVY), in case you're interested. They all work really hard to produce professional-level content for the fandom. I'm sure they're open to hearing more from their readers so they can produce even better content for everyone in the future.

Bear with me, this is going to be a rant.

&gt; To my knowledge, BTS and Big Hit have **NEVER** claimed that BTS would take the mantle of social justice warrior. This widespread belief is purely an Army/reporter's thing. It's a narrative ARMYS HAVE and are using to separate BTS from KPOP.

&gt; BTS have only outrightly stated that they hope to be the voice of youth, and that they aim to be relatable. Yes, this goal does separate them from Kpop somewhat. They have never said that they've intended to be **socially conscious**, as fans claim they are. If BTS has sang/expressed their feelings about socially relevant issues, then it's because they have feelings about it. Feelings that all of us are allowed to have, as citizens of this world. BTS just happens to have a platform to make theirs more known than the average person.

&gt; Regarding this Akimoto issue, and the Nicki collab as well as the Chainsmoker collab for that matter, I saw people claim that the collabs went against BTS's ""socially conscious/woke"" schtick since the people involved were controversial in some way. Ngl I was a bit shocked. Why are people limiting BTS and trapping them in their own arbitrary bubble about what BTS's platform is? When BTS tweet about something going on in the world, people complain. For instance, when they tweeted about the Manchester bombing, people were like ""so-and-so is happening in Mexico, why didn't they tweet about it?""

**TLDR: BTS isn't our possession, or mouthpiece. They aren't our brainless dolls. They aren't there to say what we want them to say or do what we want them to do. They're human beings who are allowed to feel what they feel and say what they say. Out only involvement as fans comes in if and when we relate to what they're saying. Imposing our own beliefs on them only makes them unable to freely say what they want to say, for fear of offending people. **",3,8,False,self,,,,,

Therefore I don't know the tone of the discussion here, had it taken place, and so desperately hope it was different from what I experienced on Twitter. 

&amp;#x200B;

That aside, I sincerely ask you to read my best attempt at translating a Korean article that outlines how it all came down. I ask you not to turn blind eyes to the unprecedented crisis that seriously jeopardized BTS's honour, reputation, and career in South Korea, their homeland, which prompted the entire fandom of K-ARMY to urgently act the way we did. Protesting against the silent treatment of BH and Bang PD was hard enough for us, let alone facing the hatred from GP, antis, and some very vocal I-ARMY. But what pains me still, now that the controversy is resolved, is the spread of hateful propaganda against K-ARMY among I-ARMY.

&amp;#x200B;

South Korea applauds K-Army for our win, and BTS is touted as being the socially-conscious group that has the courage to stand up for what is right in both Korea and Japan. 

I hope you can celebrate it as your victory as well.

**Bang Si Hyuks (\*BSH) critical self-destructive move: ARMY fandom refuses to be swayed**

We demand immediate cease to the the collaboration with the pro-imperialism, misogynistic lyricist and disposal of all relevant materials.

&amp;#x200B;

This was the phrase of protest by BTSs fandom, ARMY, against BSH, the head of the agency Big Hit, for the 4 days since September 13. After the media release of the fact that BTSs next Japanese album, to be released on November 7, will feature a song \[BIRD\], of which the lyrics was written by a Japanese producer, Yasushi Akimoto (\*YA), the fandom demanded the retraction of collaboration in a unified voice.

&amp;#x200B;

*\[Collaboration with YA: HOW DID IT BEGIN?\]*

&amp;#x200B;

On September 13, Nikkan Sports and Billboard Japan announced the release of BTSs new Japanese single album. According to their coverage, the new single would not only feature \[BIRD\], but also the Japanese versions of \[FAKE LOVE\] and \[AIRPLANE PT.2\] of their YOURSELF TEAR album. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to these media, **this collaboration was materialized by BSHs suggestion.** Apparently BSH, who showed interest in a bird story told by YA when they met a year ago, asked YA to write the story as a lyrics for the new song. It was also reported that BSH for long time has been attracted by YAs musical philosophy, and has been exchanging musical interactions.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Meeting of the tycoon of Japanese entertainment industry and the popular global Idol group: WHAT WAS PROBLEMATIC?\]

&amp;#x200B;

Not only is YA widely known as a songwriter in Japan, he has also established himself as a authoritative producer by launching a number of popular idol groups, including AKB48, SKE48, NMB48, and HKT48. The extent of his influence reaches beyond the musical industry, over the entire Japanese entertainment industry, as he also has active career as a screenwriter and movie producer. In the acknowledgement of his career, he won the Inspired Achievement trophy awarded by MAMA (Mnet Asian Music Awards) in Hong Kong in December of last year. The latest auditioning program, Produce 48, was also a project that integrated YAs AKB48 system with Koreas Produce 101.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem (\*for the ARMY) revolved around numerous controversies surrounding YA. A song by YA, \[DEAR MY TEACHER\], features phrases such as **Im fragile so hold me delicately, just like in textbook, It doesnt matter as long as (you are) younger than my dad / being younger is sexy enough / I was always your student but I can teach you something about love.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Another song by YA, \[DONT TAKE OFF MY SAILOR UNIFORM (\*Female school uniform in Japan)\] has lyrics such as **Dont take off my sailor uniform / not now, just wait, its no fun being a virgin on a date, Mom and Dad dont know that Im not coming home tomorrow.**

&amp;#x200B;

Another basis for criticism was YAs political stance as being pro-imperialist. Groups produced by YAhave been featured on the cover pages of a magazine, Mamoru, that promotes the interests of Japan Self-Defense Forces and is funded by the government of Japan. AKB48, in particular, was heavily criticized for wearing Nazi-inspired outfits on a stage in 2016. As a result, YA, who was the main producer for the stage costumes, publicly apologized for being careless. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the wake of this, ARMY argued that **YA has demonstrated through previous work that he has wrong, twisted philosophy about a certain gender, and is a lyricist who holds derogatory views on womanhood/females,** and that **Koreas attitude towards pro-imperialism is extremely uncompromising; the majority of general public would hold the same view towards BTS who collaborated with such figure. The whole world holds similar attitude towards war-criminal countries of WWII. This collaboration will jeopardize the rising of BTS.**

&amp;#x200B;

*\[BSHs decision opened a can of worm: FANS ARE NO LONGER SHEEPISH\]*

&amp;#x200B;

BHSs decision appears to have been one of critical self-destruction in the end. **In fact, the reaction from the general public after the release of collaboration was hostile.** Severe criticism towards not only BHS, but also BTS, swept over in a controversy that wouldnt have taken place had the collaboration not happened to begin with. Many also questioned BSHs decision to proceed the collaboration with such controversial figure as YA, given how the popularity of BTS is on the rise, taking over both domestic and international music scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

A voice of concern was also issued that, should BTS withdraw from the collaboration, they risk bearing the image of anti-Japan out of misunderstanding. It was also speculated that BTSs career in Japan may be jeopardized as a result of ceasing the collaboration with the entertainment industry tycoon. In fact, Japans music industry is the second biggest in the world next to the US, and BTS is enjoying an explosive popularity in Japan, sweeping all major charts such as Oricon, and selling tickets for over 380 000 audiences for their next dome tour, LOVE YOURSELF \~JAPAN EDITION\~, scheduled to last from November to next February. It appears that, for BTS, Japanese promotion is not something to be easily given up on. 

&amp;#x200B;

In spite of it, **there were reasons why this collaboration must not go on.** Since their debut in 2013, BTS has been sending messages of healing and comforting through honest stories of their experience, which resonated with the audience living the same generation. They went beyond singing and dancing on the stage, and actively participated in the production of their albums with BSH Producer, P. Dogg, the principal producer of Big Hit. Through the SKOOL and HYYH series, they evoked the empathy of students and youths, just as they sent the message of Love yourself through the LOVE YOURSELF series. The fans argued that the **collaboration, which would critically jeopardize their musical career, must stop immediately, fearing the destruction on the integrity and value of their message.**

&amp;#x200B;

*\[BH FINALLY ANSWERS TO THE FANS\]*

&amp;#x200B;

BH, who remained silent for the first two days of the controversy, broke the hiatus through the BTS official fan cafe on the 15th. Their notice said, BH acknowledges the voice of fans regarding the release of new Japanese single in November. We ask you wait as we are in the process of addressing the issue. On the following day of the 16th, they announced the retraction of the song \[BIRD\] written by YA through fan cafe. 

&amp;#x200B;

But BH only called the reason for the decision as issues concerning production and said we apologize for the inconvenience. The lack of elaboration on the controversy or formal apology can be interpreted as being aware of the sensitive nature of conflict of interests. Despite the criticism for having created this problem in the first place, BHs reaction after recognizing the problem, however late, is perceived as decent. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, BTSs new Japanese single album to be released in November will feature a total of 4 tracks - \[FAKE LOVE\] Japanese version, \[AIRPLANE PT 2\] Japanese version, \[IDOL\] remix version, \[FAKE LOVE\] Japanese remix version.

And for the fun, you cannot choose solo songs or rap/vocal specific songs. It has to be a group song.

It has been recently discovered she flew out of country to see BTS twice, but is claiming her health is so bad she can't handle being responsible and doing our gos. Her friends are defending her saying she's saved up and worked hard to get healthy enough to go to these shows back in march. The tour wasn't announced until may. Something isn't adding up here and they are toying with people's money and merchandise. She's been sitting on other people's property for months now. Some of us even question if she used the money she got from people for the gos to be able to see bts twice and afford all of that and now can only send out people's stuff when she personally can afford it. Either way what she is doing is wrong. The money and the merchandise aren't legally her's to do whatever she wants with. Avoid doing gos through her at all costs. ",3,2,False,self,,,,,

They're as authentic as they can be within the limits that are imposed on them, but at the end of the day, they're still products. Stuff like Run, Gayo, Bon Voyage, Burn the Stage, etc are all done to make us attached to Bangtan as humans that we want to give our money to. Their image is carefully constructed so that we see them as friends (close) rather than just artists (distant).

When it comes to music that targets teen girls, there is a focus on entertainment, performance and personalities over music, the only thing that should matter.

In Korean culture, it's commonly accepted that fans have ownership over idols. Fans buy hundreds of albums to get access to a fansign, but they also have the power an idol's career if it's revealed that they're dating someone. And that's a direct consequence of all the non-music content that companies produce to give fans a false sense of closeness with idols.

We have access to profiles of BTS members, that include everything from their height, to weight, to blood type. We've seen them getting ready to sleep, sleeping, and waking up. We've seen them eating. We've seen their faces with no makeup, looking completely average. Glimpses into their private moments. Basically, obsessive behavior is encouraged. Creepy stalker fans exist because Big Hit feeds into the illusion that they know their favorite members. And that's irresponsible because it puts the safety of BTS (remember the Yoongi airport incident?) and anyone who is ever linked to them (remember when Suran got death threats?) at risk.

Then, there's other stuff that worries me even more. BTS members frequently, and casually, talk about their weight gain, ugly faces without makeup, and ugly tanned skin. Even though this is accepted in Korean culture, it has a huge impact on fans around the world. They're extremely thin and they talk about being fat and needing to lose weight. How does that make fans who are actually fat feel? How does that make fans who are thin, but start believing that they're not because of them, feel? How do fans with naturally tanned skin, or dark skin, feel? I know that they mean no harm, but they're worshipped by young girls who are prone to self-consciousness and self-hatred, and if BTS think that weight gain, no makeup and tanned skin are ugly, those girls start thinking that they're ugly, and will start starving themselves and covering themselves in makeup just to be pretty in their eyes. While I wrote this I had a very specific thing in mind, that Sope Vlive where Yoongi (who has legit been underweight at some point), looking extremely thin, talked about not eating for 16 hours. That made me so uncomfortable that I closed the tab and to this day, I haven't finished the live.

I buy the different versions of the albums because I'm weak for cheap capitalism tricks and I like to collect the photocards and photobooks and pretty things lmao but I really try to convince myself that I don't need anything else that isn't music, and I don't think I would buy other stuff even if I had the money. Personally I feel conflicted about it because on the one hand I love Run, Bon Voyage, and I love seeing them being normal and their friendships with each other. It's one of the reasons why I love BTS so much. But yeah, I try to be aware of what I consume. And I really, really, wish that profiles with weight and other personal information would be removed, and that they just become more responsible when talking about these things with fans. That's the most important thing to me.

It's an industry that has been successful for decades, and we can't change it. This issue is bigger than just BTS. But how do you feel about it, and in what ways would you change it, no matter how small? Knowing that encouraging obsession brings them money, do you think that Big Hit should do something to stop it? Do you think that BTS would be as successful as they are today, if they didn't have so much non-music content to keep us busy and invested in them as people? Would you care this much as BTS if they didn't have so much content? What do you think they could do to discourage obsessive behavior? Also I'm not shaming anyone who buys lots of merch or anything. As long as you're responsible about it and respect the members' privacy, it's okay to spend money on things that make you happy. And if you feel that I'm being overdramatic, feel free to share your point of view as well.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Is it SNS? Authenticity? Their input in production of songs? Storylines? What makes them the outlier that breaks through?

Getting to go see them at the Staples Center was such an unbelievably memorable experience and I was beyond lucky I was able to score tickets at all. Seeing the boys light up the stage with their singing, dancing, and downright artistry tied in with the entire concert atmosphere was an unreal sensory experience.

To get into my main question, my sister is the extreme hardcore fan I have to thank for introducing me to the world of BTS. It's been tricky asking her anything that might come off as too ""questioning."" The touchiest subject has been other songs that I'm reminded of when I hear a BTS song.

When I first heard [Not Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL-sA0S_xT4), I commented that the first few seconds of the song reminded me of [this piece from Sherlock Season 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy_2B-diV18&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=74). I feel like I'm hearing similar melodies and the difference is in the tempo.

When I mentioned [Serendipity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSsCZJM6OG0) sounded like [Kendrick Lamar's LOVE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OCdH92wGUE) she got offended but being a fan of Kendrick as well she must have had a change of heart after arguing because she later agreed that they sounded ""just slightly similar.""

Today, after hearing [Love Maze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_R0-YosZ3g) playing in the Line Friends store, I finally realized that the beat reminded me of Ariana Grande's [Be My Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkamQpYmokI) and [Right There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXYQdpilpW4). She shut that comment down, suggesting I was just forcing myself to hear things.

I'm not looking to pick a fight, to win or lose. I'll never be as devoted and knowledgeable a fan as she is and I'm by no means a music theorist nor am I trying to cement a position as one. But when it comes to BTS, any little thing that sounds like it could come off as criticism triggers an argument. I've had to preface anything that could be interpreted as even the slightest bit negative about these amazing artists, with ""don't take this the wrong way"", ""no offense"", ""just hear me out"", etc. I would love to hear any thoughts!",43,9,False,self,,,,,

We already knew that they gonna extend the promotion in japan later this november.

However, as BTS just get announced to speak at United Nations for UNICEF's 'Generation Unlimited' Launch later next week, I can't help to connect that this kind of campaign sort of hinting their new era/concept for next album.

&gt;World leaders will launch a new partnership to get every young person into quality education, training or employment by 2030, next week at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly. [*Generation Unlimited*](http://www.genunlimited.org/) **will tackle the global education and training crisis currently holding back millions of young people and threatening progress and stability.** 

As we know Love Yourself era connected with their Love Myself campaign, maybe i seem reaching here but i have read somewhere that BTS hinted that their next comeback maybe related with ""concern"". I read it from press conference Love Yourself:Answer. I will link here when i get to find where did i read it.

Somehow, if their topic in their next era/album would be about ""concern"", this really connected well with the latest campaign which wanting helping youth in their future. As we know, we all have own concern in living this world. I found this kind of topic is really interesting to be main thing in their next album and may help more in realizing this ""GENERATION UNLIMITED"" campaign.

So, what do you guys thinking? I am sorry if i look kinda reaching here. Any more idea for their next era?",5,77,False,self,,,,,

Watch this https://www.vlive.tv/video/14818 from 27:10. i'm guessing something happened and thats why namjoon says ""this is the beauty of real-time broadcast"" but it's obvious that the video was cut so i was wondering if, while this video was playing live at the time, did they show whatever it was or did they also, somehow cut it out, even when it was streaming ""live""? i'm a new fan so..this is me asking old fans who watched this live if they can remember, please.

'' Dear BTS,   
some years ago, my friend was going  through the hardest time of her life. She is someone very important to  me, everytime I would leave her house I could see how lonely she felt, I  was afraid to leave her alone. One night when I visited her, she showed  me a video of 7 boys being goofy, but who were also very talented. For  the first time in a while, I saw my friend laugh out loud. Just for her,  we would spend multiple nights listening to your music and watch random  videos of you. Rapidly, I also became a fan.  
Yesterday, after 3  years, we ""met"" you for the first time. We drove hours to get to  Hamilton Canada, where we spent an amazing time with the BTS Army of all  ages (literally ALL ages). During those hours, you made us live so many  emotions. From excited to calm, from empowered to vulnerable, but most  importantly happy the whole time. I cried at some point while watching  your concert, I couldn't figure out why and it was bothering me. Was I  being selfish and wanted you to stay for ever? It didn't seem right...  But now I understand. I'm so thankful for you being you. You brought so  many inside jokes between my friend and I, you gave us so many happy  moments, you were also there with her when I wasn't.  
You guys  were so professinal up there on stage, delivering exactly what your  songs are about and we all can feel it. Of course, it's also thanks to  your amazing team behind you, the organization was absolutely perfect!  
Thank  you for putting so much effort and time into your work. We are  absolutely so proud of you. The last part of the concert was important  for us, since we had time to connect with you and your real selves. On  our way back home, my friend and I were talking about how we are worried  that you guys suffocate with all the pressure. We really hope you guys  put yourselves first, each one of you are extremely talented, loved and  will be supported no matter what.

A while ago I wrote and posted a poem based on The Truth Untold, and I'm gladly back again with another poem!

Ever since the beginning and end of the Love Yourself series, especially with Answer, Ive done a lot of self-reflection (as is the special effect of BTS, especially RM and his introspective lyrics) and some more thinking about the meaning of self-love, and I would love to get deeper into that, but that would turn this post into a whole book, so maybe I'll save that for a different thread! I do not have a title for it yet (I'm terrible at coming up with titles for anything), but anyway, I hope you love this poem as much as I did writing it! But don't be afraid of sharing any constructive criticism - I would greatly appreciate your feedback! I can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to my poems, and even after this poem went through a lot of changes and polishing, I still don't feel fully satisfied with the result and keep changing and re-editing some bits and adding new things, but I really couldn't wait to share it here, so forgive me if there are any mistakes or flaws (I'm probably gonna edit it again after I post it, lol).

 

 

Submerged in my ocean of venomous fears and abyssal questions, 

Force my eyes open, only to be stabbed by that toxic reflection, 

In this serpentine labyrinth, lost all sense of direction;

My heart bleeds, and beats, and pleads for you (to keep me safe and sound), 

Your loving embrace that warms me like a comforter of eiderdown,

Oh, shield me from the icy, cruel hands of winter now (a prayer to be found);

Only by your dazzling beams am I able to photosynthesize,

Only you, your mellifluous voice that croons a lullaby, soothing my

The dream disintegrates and is devoured by the raging maelstrom

Frantic a lunatic scrabbling at the dissipating mirage of... your... hand.

The distant glimmer of moonlight 

Pierces the suffocating gloom

Gradually clearing my clouded sight.

&amp;#x200B;

Moulding the fragments of my heart into a work of art, 

Not a perfect masterpiece, but the Light that enters through my wound

Speaks of a simple yet profound truth:

Against the Warlord of the mind, stands strong the Warrior of the soul -

Deep within the incomplete masterpiece, awaits your one and only Master of Peace.

That has been the key missing puzzle piece,

To the jigsaw of my existence  the unfathomable sea of questions.

I may be as insignificant as a snail in a world rushing ahead in ceaseless traffic,

But lonely I am not, for all the galaxies and planets in the universe reside within me;

From atop the snow-capped mountains that pierce the leaden clouds of anxiety, 

In the azure skies that stretch to infinity, beyond the boundaries of reality,

Over the stone Bridge of Ambition to the Golden Gates to my Eden above.

The crystal clear rivers filled with boundless goldmines of Hope and Wisdom,

The rainforest of Dreams and eternal Green, and the Garden of Love  my canvas,

Bursting with bold, ecstatic splashes and brushes, a rainbow of unique flowers and plants 

I can feel the cosmos moving within my soul, through my veins, as deep and immense as the ocean,

For all of this was reborn from the past century of relentless rains.

&amp;#x200B;

All of my scars congregate to form my constellation,  

That shines in my Milky Way, above the walls of my maze 

An opening, I can at last glimpse it beyond the thick haze.

Letting go of your hand that I shackled my lonely, earthly existence to,

As I spread my young wings that I once clipped  the Hope I had razed 

To soar through the newfound portal of the universe inside my soul,

In the heavens, my constellation  with magnificence  shall one day be raised.

&amp;#x200B;

The feral child behind your eyes, the tear-stained face in the mirror 

I can finally see, through the precious I in the gift of my present life  tis no error,

For indeed, in this moment, the beauty in the beast couldnt be any clearer.",3,31,False,self,,,,,

The story behind it:

 (BTW The first kpop song I discovered was call me baby by exo, so I already knew that kpop has amazing dancing and stunning mvs.)

I had recently joined the kpop community and was a fan for about 2 weeks when I discovered Bts. I liked them and their music. There was so much content and the boys were so funny. They entertained me. 
I heard the song spine breaker in a video and it shocked me when I found out that it was a Bts song?? Like what? It just didnt make any sense? I heard I need U, Dope and Run. But spine breaker was something else. It was also the first kpop song I  read the lyrics to. I couldnt believe a kpop group, a boy group would release such a song.

I'm definitely hyung to BTS, but I don't know anyone my age or younger that has cable TV or listens to the radio. I recall mention of how BTS could do a better job working with radio stations, but what benefit does it reap?

I think appearing on Ellen, AGT, AMA, BBMA, the Late Late show, and the Tonight show are sufficient indicators of mainstream success. As a performance-focused group (by their own admission), I would think televised appearances carry more weight than radio.

In terms of badges of honor for ARMY, I'd say helping UNICEF raise $1 million USD deserves a bigger pat on the back than breaking T. Swift's YT record or even topping Billboard.

So what's the big deal about radio play?",116,66,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

New ARMY here (what have I been missing), with a question about seeing BTS in Nagoya on January 12th/13th. My family and I have planned a trip to Japan and I was pleasantly surprised to see we will be in Nagoya when BTS will be performing. I've been eyeing the tickets for a while and recruited the help of a Japanese ticket concierge service as I cannot read Japanese at all and was getting so flustered with the ticket purchasing process.

&amp;#x200B;

Could someone explain to me how fan club tickets vs general admission tickets work? The concierge service explained that fan club tickets have names/addresses on them in Japan and IDs are generally checked -  names cannot be changed on a resale ticket so it would seem unwise to purchase fan club resale tickets as I could be turned away at the door. But, I note on the BTS website it states that the show is sold out. Does that mean that fan club tickets are sold out, and general admission tickets won't go on sale at all (therefore I have no choice but to buy a resale fan club ticket)?

&amp;#x200B;

I must sound so clueless right now and I apologize, unfortunately I have never attended a concert outside of the US and guess I foolishly assumed the buying process was similar to the US. Any suggestions on what next steps I can take to ensure a ticket would be greatly appreciated. Right now I have asked the concierge service to purchase general admission resale tickets, but happy to get back to them with other instructions if anyone thinks there's a better way to go about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for helping a silly American have a once in a lifetime experience :)",7,18,False,self,,,,,

After listening to a long speech of KNJ, I bet each of us is staying in the state of seriousness, I mean really :D. His speech is truly inspirational, so I feel the urge to come here and say something. 
I normally do not write long in social media. I use Facebook, but I choose to write my thoughts here, because not every ""friend"" of mine in Facebook cares what I wrote. Wow that's hurt, but I want to speak myself. The problem is, I have been living for years minding what people say, I'm not even raise my voice because I always feel that I'm wrong. And I'm afraid of loosing friends. But after a long time, I decided that I need to change. I have to live for myself. No matter what, in the end of the day I'm still me, and I'm the one who need to be respected. No such thing is called friendship if either of you respect another. And don't ever afraid of making mistakes. None of us can always be perfect. You can always put things right at the end. Just be wrong, and I hope there is someone/something to fix you. 
My point is, be yourself. Don't afraid of the others. And there are always people who listen to you. Believe that, because at least you got me. 
Thanks Namjoon for making me realize how things should be done. And thank you for listening. Tell me your story. I want to understand you as much as you understand me.",47,191,False,self,,,,,

I dont mean their stage outfits (thats another conversation), but their street style has really calmed down a lot. I felt like 2016 they began to evolve more into higher fashion street style and then somewhere around 2017 their style completely changed. Not only did their tastes change, they also dont try to be very picture ready anymore. I find this very intriguing if anything. Do you guys miss old bts fashion or do you prefer the current? In my opinion, it really depends. I kind of feel like I havent seen BTS dress up in something I liked in a minute, but at the same time I kind of like the fact that theyre non-conforming. Not only do they generally dress down even for media photos, their tastes also changed. When it comes to their current fashion tastes, I will say I kind of wish for something more on the route of what they were going for around the 2016 era but more current to 2018. I feel like I see BTS wear the same thing a lot of the time (no shade namjoon). But on the other hand, I like that theyre comfortable enough with themselves to feel like they can do whatever they want. If it was up to me, I would kind of like something in the middle. What are your thoughts? ",18,54,False,self,,,,,

Also what would be some of your dream interview/promos for them to do in your country?

For me in the UK, I'd love them to perform on Graham Norton. It's quite hard to choose though as most of our talk shows are very talk-heavy and don't have fun segments that would help battle the language barrier like America does. I'd also like to see them interviewed by Korean Englishman (youtuber), he's done quite a few celebrity interviews and as he knows the language I think they'd be quite comfortable with him. Although I can't see that being good promo for them over here as his channel is more watched by a Korean audience.

Edit: Actually I'd also like to see them on BBC Radio 1! They have a lot of fun segments they could participate in.",57,73,False,self,,,,,

I basically lived downtown Hamilton for 4 days during their Canadian leg of the world tour lol.. the second part is a small recap of my concert weekend. Enjoy ! )

Part 1: Tips for people attending the concerts

\- If you want to get merch ( especially hoodies, t-shirts, mini-bags, hats, etc ) I highly recommend you going on the FIRST concert date in your city! A lot of the popular merch gets sold out by the time the second or third concert date comes along. For the Hamilton concerts, half the items were already sold out by Saturday afternoon. Even if you are not attending the concert on the first date, go line up for merch! And line up early. We had friends who lined up at 5:30am and by the time they go to the front, a lot of stuff was sold out. Keep in mind the limit to buy a lot of the clothing merch is set to 3, and basically every single person at the front of the line WILL BUY 3 OF EVERYTHING. I suggest lining up no later than 2 or 3am if you're after clothing.

\- GA is 100% worth it, but ONLY if you are able to camp out the day before. When we camped out for Saturday GA, by the time Friday night 8pm rolled around, there was already over 500 people camping. If you are unable to camp out the day before, buy seated tickets, the lower bowl tickets still have AMAZING views ( I say seated, but not a single person stays seated during the show )

\- Don't be scared to camp out for GA/merch the night before! Even if you think it's a sketchy area, there are going to be TONS of other armys camping, and everyone is going to be SUPER nice !  I do suggest, however, to bring a big blanket or sleeping bag. The temperature drops DRASTICALLY overnight. To put it into perspectives, during the day, Hamilton temp. was 26 and sunny. By midnight, it was 2 degrees and rainy. Get a tarp from walmart or dollar store, and bring a blanket/pillow/sleeping bag. 

\- Get inside the venue early. Starting 2 hours before the concert starts, they start playing music videos on the big screens, and you can jam out with fellow armys and practice fan chants! Trust me, the atmosphere because super hype long before the concert starts.

\- Buy an army bomb! Its the best 75$ ( Canadian, cheaper in the US ) I've ever spent. They have people all around the venue to help you pair it. It uses 3x AAA batteries, so bring your own or you'll have to pay 5 bucks for them at the venue.

\- You're going to spend a lot of time in lines. Don't be afraid to talk to people in front/behind you ! It helps pass the time a lot faster, and trust me, Army people are the nicest people you will ever find, and everyone is doing the exact same thing as you. I met some super amazing people.. literally standing in line! 

\- If you have a small bladder, considering visiting the bathrooms well in advance to when you actually ""HAVE TO GO"". Every single bathroom within a walking distance from the venue had a 50+ person line up for the female bathroom. If you're a male like me.. well there was no line so don't worry you can wait until the last minute :) ( On a side note, I saw a ton of females using the male bathroom over the weekend.. I'm not trying to promote this kind of behavior.. but.. if you HAVE to go... and theres a 40 people waiting line in front of you.. consider your options ! )

\- Waters inside the concert hall costs 5 dollars. IT SUCKS. But I highly recommend buying one. Because you WILL scream. And you WILL dance. And you WILL sweat. And you WILL get EXTREMELY THIRSTY. And once the concert starts, you're not going to want to leave your seat. Buy one before you go to your seat. Again, buying a 5 dollar bottle of water is straight robbery. But hey its only one time.

\- Please be mindful of the people and space around you! It's going to be super packed, everyone is going to be super hyped, everyone is going to be loud and screaming and moving around, please stay safe! I saw people getting pushed on the floor, I've personally had people bop me on the head with army bombs, try to keep yourself and people around you safe!

&amp;#x200B;

That's about it for me, if you have any other question regarding the concert, feel free to post or pm me ( Don't ask me anything about BTS tho I'm a noob LOL )

Part 2: My story

A week ago, I didn't even know their names. I couldn't tell them apart based on what they looked like, and I didn't know their stories. I heard a few of their songs from friends who were hardcore army and enjoyed them, so when their concert tour came to my hometown in Toronto, I was open to the idea of going but never was TOO hyped about it. Everything changed within 4 days. I met tons of people that I would otherwise never have had the chance to meet, and they all welcomed me with open arms like we were family. United by a single common interest, tens of thousands of people coming from different race, age, backgrounds and stories came together as one Army. I was simply blown away by how nice and inviting everyone was. Thousands of people came in the wee hours of dawn and formed their own unofficial lines to buy merch, long before official staff started working. Hundreds of people camped outside days before the concert in freezing rain weather in hopes of securing a good GA floor spot. Despite being sleep and food deprived, as well as being cold and wet, I saw nothing but positivity around me. ""Omg I love your t-shirt! Jin is my bias too !!"". ""Do you need something to drink? Are you cold? Maybe some snacks? We have so much food we'll never finish come have some!"" were common things you heard amongst conversation between complete strangers. There was so much energy and light in the air at 4am in the downtown streets of a normally slightly sketchy town. One moment I'll never forget; it was Saturday morning.. after camping out for 2 days, as I walked through Jackson Square, thousands of people around me were hurrying about, some trying to get merch, some waiting for photo booth pictures, some eating, waiting for line ups, some trying desperately to get last minute tickets. All of a sudden one girl starts blasting music from her phone.. ""I'm so sorry for this.. faku lovuu"" - every single person within earshot, regardless of what they were doing, screamed at the top of their lungs: "" FAKE LOVE! FAKE LOVE! FAKE LOVE! "". I'm not normally too emotional of a person.. but hearing fan chant live really will bring a tear or two to your eyes.

After being lucky enough to secure front row GA spot, we were winked at.. smiled at.. waved at.. and thrown water at by a lot of the members of the group. When Hobi looked right into our camera and blew us a kiss.. I gotta admit it was hard to not buckle at the knees. And this is coming from a heterosexual male in his late twenties. I'm sure you've all heard of the phase ""money can't buy happiness"". Well this 5 day BTS weekend really made me believe it. Sure, we spent a substantial amount of money on tickets and such, but the true happiness that came from it was contributed by the endless number of amazing strangers we met, and the irresistible charm from a boy band from half way across the world. It was worth every penny we spent and more.. it was truly an experience of a lifetime. Getting to share this experience with my favorite human in the entire world was magical. Seeing her smile so purely every time I looked at her washed away all the hunger and sleepiness and pain and cold. 

I think I can safely say.. the BTS army grew by one after last weekend. Stay safe army, and remember.. to love yourself. xoxo",2,4,False,self,,,,,

This isn't an ""unpopular opinions"" thread, though. I would just like to know what you would, in your secret heart of hearts, like to know about BTS so as to validate my suspicions that we too are only human lol Feel free to answers people's questions as well! 

I'll go first:

1) to Jin - when did you first notice that you are exceedingly good-looking? Did you always think so, or did ARMY make you realise it?
2) to Jimin - you have developed a vocal quirk where you pinch off your notes in a sliding, loose way. are you properly taking care of your voice, or are you suffering from some kind of weakness in your vocal chords??
3) to all - have any of you ever experienced what you thought was true love? how has your experience or lack of experience impact your approach to writing/expressing music?
4) to all - was there ever a time you thought you weren't cut out to be an idol/role model? How did you overcome that fear?

I think there were at least 20 of them popping up in that timespan of 10mins as I kept trying to purchase and refresh when I failed. I thought I was really quick but somebody just managed to beat me everytime. 

Now the bad news, I didnt manage to get any ticket and I have refreshed over 100 times now but there are no longer any standard ones. What made me mad was there are actually many new resale tickets being listed right now (they werent there this afternoon) and the section and row numbers were definitely from those newly released standard tickets. 

Think I saw an article the other day about Ticketmaster having their own bots to benefit scalpers (and themselves, since they earn extra fee on resales). Does anyone have more information about this? I kinda want to believe that bots did this quick buying and reselling.

Like, yes, they are young men (boys even depending on your age and how you perceive them) and they are in a ""band"" (but it's more like a group...)

I guess there's some stigma when it comes to the term ""boy band"" in Western culture. Almost like if you're in a boy band, you're a lesser musician? Which is 1000% not the case here (uhhh UN anyone?). Is this stigma there in other cultures?

I just don't understand why this term keeps being used? The Beatles weren't a ""boy band"" so why is BTS? (Yes, I compared them to the Beatles like Ellen, but I'm not wrong, fight me).

What differentiates a ""boy band"" from a ""band"" or ""group""? Is it the size? The perceived fan base? (I'm 28 and I know there are many other noonas out there so hmu) Or is it because they're an idol group and it's the closest thing the westerners can understand?

There are not a lot of changes this time, but this announcement is to discuss a few topics with you.

*****

**If you are new to the subreddit or just reddit in general**, please check these out:

[](#button) [Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules) [](#button) [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/faq) [](#button) [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/index) [](#button) [Reddit 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/8svpik/180621_reddit_101_an_illustrated_guide_and/)

There are lots of resources to help you listed on the header bar. Before making your first submission, it would be good to be familiar with the rules. You can also hang around the subreddit for a while first, so youll get a feel of the community and what type of content is generally well liked here.

*****

#Self-promotion rule

We enforce [reddits general guidelines for self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as rules on this subreddit. This page is linked on our rules and includes everything you need to know about the policy. Also nobody reads it, so we included a tl;dr of the most common points of confusion in the rules:

&gt;* You should not just start submitting your links - it will be unwelcome and may be removed as spam, or your account will be banned as spam.
* Approximately 10% or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content.
* Be a good member of the community and dont use the sub only to your advantage.

**Note:** Even if you are a member of the community, we discourage using the subreddit for the purpose of advertising goods and services, or asking for monetary support on other than charity projects. We allow posting fanart on the subreddit, and occasionally it comes with a link to a place where you can support the creator. These submissions are evaluated on a case by case basis; the main point of the submission should be the art, not marketing.

#Title format

There has been some confusion about the title format. While sticking to the format is preferable, we wont penalize you for adding more information as long as everything required by the format is fulfilled. As an example, an official MV doesnt *require* a date, but adding the date doesnt do any harm either. Were sorry for the confusion with the format in the past from our side and try to be more consistent with it from now on. In the end, **the main function of the title format is to make sure the submissions are distinct and searchable.**

#Tattoos and other frequently posted content

Weve had a significant increase in tattoo posts in the last couple of months. They have been counted as fanart and allowed as their own submissions thus far, but almost every one of them gets some amount of reports. So, wed like to ask your opinion: **would you prefer tattoo posts be redirected to the weekly /r/bangtan Room thread?**

We have also received a request to limit Ryuseralover submissions, as they have seen a spike too. We already redirect the more memetastic ones to the weekly thread, but the line can often be hard to draw. **What are your thoughts on Ryu posts?**

**Is there any other type of content you feel is too frequent or otherwise lacking in substance?**

#Drama

Weve seen more criticism of the subreddits drama rule, especially from people who havent been here for very long yet. **We have no plans to remove or change this rule.** Sometimes it can be hard to evaluate what is nonsense and what warrants a legitimate discussion, but we do our best to navigate that grey area. The (relative) lack of mess has always been one of the most important qualities of this community, so we hope you can accept that as you become a part of it. If this is something you strongly disagree with, there are plenty of other unmoderated platforms where you can discuss dramatic happenings.

#Reports

We appreciate reports, since they alert us to potential issues so we can deal with them fast. Its also alright to report even if youre unsure whether something breaks the rules or not  well check it out anyway.

However, there has been an increase in reports that seem to [miss the point](https://i.imgur.com/sNsS2Af.png) somewhat. These reports either ask us a question or [offer an opinion](https://i.imgur.com/GqSCHNu.png) about the [post or comment](https://i.imgur.com/w6TDRx7.png) (and its often a strongly worded one).

Reports are anonymous. If you have a question to ask us, the best way is to send modmail, so we can offer you a response.

If you have an opinion about the post or comment you are reporting, feel free to express that opinion directly to that user (in a civil way). Please dont use the report function to seek validation for an opinion from us  were not here to decide which opinion is acceptable and which is wrong. We mostly care if the reported post breaks the rules or not. For this reason **its preferable to use the rule presets when reporting**, unless you really need to provide context in the other box.

#Other reminders

**Domain blacklist:** [We have one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/wiki/rules#wiki_c._other) Your comment is filtered if you link to sites listed on it.

**Comment formatting:** You can find formatting help [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6ewgt/reddit_markdown_primer_or_how_do_you_do_all_that/c03nik6/).

Most common issues:

* A hashtag (#) makes a header when used at the start of a line. Use a backslash before the special character to escape the formatting: `\#JIMIN` will show up as \#JIMIN.

* Numbered lists always start at 1. They are numbered automatically. If theres a paragraph between your numbered items, markdown interprets it as a new list and starts again at 1. Backslash escapes the formatting in this case as well.

*****

Thats it! If you have any questions/comments, please let us know.

We have seated tickets, and the show starts at 7:00 pm. What time should we arrive at the venue, should we take anything with us? How should we dress, it's October and NY is pretty cold, but I have no idea if stadium concerts are open roof or whatever &gt;_&lt; 

How do the logistics of all that (the line, entering the venue, merch, etc) work? Are cameras allowed? We have no clue what to expect!

I bought a set of S, E, L, F and all 4 of them have misprinted sleeves. I registered my address for replacement and I received the new sleeves! The process was very simple and easy, they shipped them a lot faster than I expected (I'm in South East Asia). It doesn't matter where you get your album from, Big Hit will replace the sleeve for free (and you get to keep both the misprinted and the correct sleeve!). You will need the QR code included in the album to request for replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

They open online registration for this replacement until November 30.

Misprinted part was the Hanja character of '' the correct one is '' (only on the side of the outer sleeve, front side &amp; actual album/photobook are printed correctly).

# Disclaimer and Rules: 

***This is post is not meant to scare, deter, or prevent anyone from going to concerts or events. The purpose of this post is to inform all event goers on how to stay safe while traveling. Please read this post even if you are a seasoned traveler as you may learn something new or at least be able to refresh your knowledge before an event. To those of you who have never traveled to America, who are traveling alone, who are splitting up into groups at some point during the event, who are meeting someone at the event, or who are young and/or inexperienced in traveling, I urge you to read this post as it may help you avoid unnecessary situations or, worse, more serious consequences.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

***Please note that while I will not go into too much graphic detail, this post will contain writing that deals with scenarios such as robbery, stalking, rape, and even kidnapping. If you are easily triggered by these topics, then feel free to not read this. However, I urge all of us to be informed of these topics and how to deal with them as it could prevent possible harm to you or another human.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

***Also note this is not to point fingers at, blame, or promote fear towards certain countries, areas, or people living in said areas. It is only to inform you of what you should do should you encounter a person who wishes to cause you harm. Do not take the actions of one person and project them onto a group of people due to one shared characteristic (such as area or country of origin). What is normal for you and your country/culture may not be acceptable in another. Please take the time to research where you're traveling and the appropriate ways to behave in said areas.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

***Please be aware that I am an American--I do not know the procedures or laws of other countries. I can only speak for myself and what I'm aware of. What works in my country may be a service that is not available in yours, or worse, could be illegal. Also please note that in America, each state has different laws concerning different ways that are considered appropriate in handling the following scenarios. I will not be addressing every states laws so please do your research. If you are an American ARMY, feel free to correct or expand on anything I say if you know your state does or does not allow a certain action.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

***Do NOT use this thread to start drama. Anything racist, nationalist, sexist, non-constructive, or anything that does not follow this sub-reddit's or Reddit's rules will be addressed and/or deleted by the admin.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

***Please note that while this is an informational post, there will be room for discussion. Since we will be having many more events coming up in the near and far future in various countries, I want this to be an open forum where we can share laws, helpful tips, stats, and police-related information from all over the world. This is a safe place, quite literally, where all of us should come together to help prevent harm towards others.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we got that out of the way, let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Ways to Stay Safe: 

I know I'm going out of order from the list above but I wanted to address this before anything else as doing the following things will limit the possibility of a crime happening to you. Predators and attackers look for certain cues to pick out their potential victims--avoiding these cues could save you or another person's life. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Have a plan in place.**

Before you begin your traveling, have a plan in place that maps out where you will be and what you plan on doing during your trip. It's best to make a plan before departing your home or hotel room. Having a plan not only helps in making the most of your time during your trip, but it also allows you to know where you are going and when. It's best to give your travel plans to someone you trust, such as a  parent, guardian, friends, or significant other. Should an emergency happen, your loved ones will be able to contact you and/or know where you are located at any given time. If you can, send pictures of what you are wearing (such as in a selfie) to your loved ones so that they have a current picture of what you are wearing that day. Also make sure they have a current head-shot photo of you so that if something were to happen to you, the police have updated information concerning what you look like. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Do hourly check-ins.**

This goes along with keeping your loved ones updated on your whereabouts. At the very least, do an hourly check-in call with your loved one or friends so that they know you are safe. If you are traveling to an area that you didn't plan on going in or if you're going there earlier or later than you originally planned, call your check-in buddy and inform them of this. For those of you who are not familiar with the area in which you are traveling, you are young, or if you are traveling alone, I encourage you to do check-ins every 30 minutes as your risk for becoming a victim is higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Swap numbers.**

If you do not have anyone to be your check-in buddy, find one. Maybe there's other fans staying in your hotel who seem trustworthy or maybe you met a few good people while waiting in line. Don't be afraid to ask if they would be willing to be your check-in buddy. Also, use the hotel staff to your advantage. Most staff know the area and that you may be traveling alone. Let them know that you will be calling in every 30 minutes to an hour to update them on your status. Let them know that if you don't call within a certain time period, to immediately call an emergency number. I would like to think most hotel staff would not have a problem with this. ***I would recommend that you use extreme caution when doing this--someone can seem trustworthy but be a horrible person inside. Please be careful when giving out any personal information!***

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Stay in groups.**

Please DO NOT walk the streets alone if possible, at least not in America, and especially if you are a female. If you see a group of fans walking down the street, ask if you can join them. You may end up making new friends in the process! Also, do not walk back to your hotel/residence by yourself if you can help it as it will be later and darker, and you will be more likely to be a victim in such circumstances. Even if you can't find a group of ARMYs, try to stay in public, open places where there are a lot of witnesses. Do your best to blend in with a group, couple, or person who is walking in the direction you are. If an attacker thinks you are with another person, they will be less likely to attack. If you notice a fan walking by themselves to the concert and you feel safe or especially if you're in a group, feel free to ask them if they'd like to travel with you and your group. 

&amp;#x200B;

A great example of this was when I was a teenager in a major grocery store in my hometown. My mother and I split up so we could get groceries faster. A man began to follow me and I felt uncomfortable. To see if he truly was following me, I went down aisles that were populated but probably not interesting to him (such as women's clothing). After careful examination, I realized he was indeed following me. Immediately I got into a larger area and began looking for someone to help me. Looking at baby clothes was a mother who had two children. I literally stood right next to her and didn't move. I acted as if she knew me, getting so close I could have touched her. The woman was shocked but when I motioned with my eyes that there was someone behind me, she looked and saw this man acting as if he was looking at teenager tank-tops. She immediately gave me a knowing look and said loudly, ""OH HONEY HOW NICE OF YOU TO GET THE MILK FOR ME. YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD DAUGHTER!"" We pretended we were together and walked down the aisle. The man gave up and left. The women waited until he left the store and then told me that I was safe. She asked me if she needed to help me find my mom. Luckily, my mom showed up so I was able to thank the lady and tell her I was good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately for many people, these types of scenarios happen ***EVERY DAY.*** Please be aware of your surroundings and stay in areas where there are people who can help you. Don't be afraid to break normal social boundaries and do as I did. Also, if you notice someone in distress, feel free to ask them if they are okay, and offer to help them as best as you can (please do not put your own life in danger, though. Think critically!). 

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# If it's a fan who is in distress, use the following code-phrase:

# ""How was Jimin's dancing?""

**Essentially this is going to mean, ""Are you okay?"" or ""Do you need help?""**

&amp;#x200B;

# There will be two responses to this phrase: a negative response and a positive response.

# 

**A positive response will sound like this:**

# ""His dancing was great!""

# ""I loved his dancing!""

# ""He's a great dancer!""

# 

**This means that the person is either doing okay, or they aren't aware of the code-phrase to begin with. If they seem okay, then feel free to leave them alone or follow up with more obvious questions if they still seem distressed.** 

# 

**A negative response will sound like this:**

# ""He was a terrible dancer.""

# ""I thought he sucked.""

# ""He's the worst dancer ever!""

# This type of answer will mean that the person is NOT okay and needs help.

# 

**There was a reason why I chose this as the catch-phrase. Most people love the Mochi, and most people acknowledge that he's a fantastic dancer. For someone to respond in a negative fashion to his dancing would imply that something is wrong. If someone responds negatively, immediately follow up with more obvious questions to see if they are truly in distress and need help, or if they just suck at judging a dancer's ability.**

&amp;#x200B;

***If it's the former, then help get the person out of that situation, get yourselves to safety, and call the police.*** 

***If it's the later, then just leave them alone because ain't nobody got time for that mess.*** 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Stay in well-lit areas.**

This tip is pretty easy to follow. If it looks like a dark area, stay out of it. If you must walk through a dark area, use your phone's flashlight and quickly get to the nearest light source (such as street lamp). Attackers are less likely to attack you if they think they may be seen by witnesses.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Be smart about what information you share.**

You are not obligated to share any personal info with anyone. This includes your name, phone number, where you're from, where you are staying, or for how long you'll on your trip. Also, do not disclose if you are traveling alone unless it's to a trusted individual! It's better to appear rude to a stranger than give out too much information and regret it later.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Know where you're going.** 

During daylight hours, feel free to walk the areas in which you will be traveling. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, watch YouTube videos of people recording their trips down these roads, using the bus systems of that area, or riding the train/subway. When I was planning on going to Newark, I used Google Maps to ""walk"" and learn the streets and buildings in which I would see while going to the venue. This will help you tremendously as not only will you know how to get to your destination, but you will be able to navigate these areas in the dark when coming back from the concert or event. Knowing where you're going is a HUGE deterrent for attackers. If you walk with purpose to your destination, most attackers assume you know the area well, and may even be traveling to meet someone else. Knowing where you're going also prevents you from getting lost when traveling. 

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Use your phone to your advantage.**

This is a big one. With technology being so helpful and quick, you MUST use your phone to your advantage while traveling. We've already discussed doing check-ins and using your phone as a flashlight, but there is another way to use it: emergency information. ***I highly advise everyone reading this to put in contact information of the local police stations including phone numbers and addresses, your own personal emergency contacts, and various emergency hotlines and, of course, 911. Having this information pre-programmed into your phone will allow you to quickly access help. Please put the addresses of emergency personnel stations into your GPS's so that if you are being pursued by an attacker, you know where to go to be safe.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Keep your phone and keys out. Keep your money hidden away and your IDs on you at all times.**

Last but not least (unless I think of more things later), keep your phone and keys out. When traveling, feel free to pretend or actually call someone while walking down the street. Keep your head up, be aware of your surroundings and the people in them, and talk/pause/then talk more. Keeping your keys out is good as well as keys can double as weapon. I know no-one wants to think of having to hurt another person but in self-defense it could be the difference between living and dying. Keep you keys in your dominant hand, the one you're most likely to punch someone with. Place one key in between each finger with the key ""teeth"" (the long pointy end that goes into the door) sticking up towards the tops of your knuckles and the thicker part of the keys held firmly between your fingers and palm. It should look almost like a bear claw. Should someone attack you and you can't get away, you can use this extra form of protection to jab, stab, and punch at your attacker. It sucks that I have to say this but it can happen and I'd rather prepare you all in case it does.

&amp;#x200B;

Keeping your money hidden helps prevent robbers from stealing your cash. I've heard of people putting a few dollars in their purses or pockets to pull out if the robber wants money (as a way to get them to leave) but have the bulk of their cash in their shoe or bra. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having your ID on you is an absolute MUST. Do not leave anywhere without your ID! If you do not have a Driver's License, use your student ID or any other card that has your name and (hopefully) picture on it. This will help police identify you if you are found or if they need to confirm your identity when saving you.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# What to do if you are attacked:

While I don't like having to write this, I think it's best that we all stay informed how you can get away from an attacker during an emergency. The following tips are ones that I hope you never have to use, but stay fast in your mind in case you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Use your voice!**

Scream and yell as much as possible! Make a lot of noise! Do whatever it takes to make a commotion. Please note that if you are being sexually assaulted, it's better to scream ""FIRE!"" than ""RAPE!"" This has been proven to (unfortunately) be more effective in getting people to notice that you need aid. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Pinch, punch, and kick.**

If someone is attacking you, try to get away to safety *first*. Do not engage if you don't have to as you don't know if this person has a gun, a knife, or some other weapon. Get as far away from the person as possible. But if that doesn't work, do what you have to do to get yourself to safety. Again, I hate that I have to write this but if you need to elbow the person, punch them, or pinch them, then do so. Focus as best as you can and be mindful: you want to disarm them and keep them from hurting you. ***You are NOT trying to kill them. Don't EVER let that be your aim.***

&amp;#x200B;

Most people respond negatively to pain--performing these actions in sensitive areas such as the groin, stomach, jaw, or nose usually is enough to send people to the ground long enough for you to run. If you are attacked or grabbed from behind, elbow the attacker in the stomach or reach around and pinch the attacker AS HARD AS YOU CAN on the inside of their thigh. The inside of the thigh is extremely sensitive and most people (men especially) feel quite a lot of pain when this action is performed. The pinching trick is also useful if your attacker is on top of you--just reach down and pinch! I will link YouTube videos below so that if you want further information you'll have it concerning self-defense.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Call the police.**

Don't call your parents, your best friend Sue, or Bobby Loo from down the street. 

***Call. The. Police.*** 

**911 is the common and most well-known emergency hotline in America.** 

When you call, the operator will respond, *""What is your emergency?""* 

At that point, in as calm as a voice as you can, tell the operator **clearly** what has or is happening. 

Examples are:

""I'm being followed by someone.""

""I've been raped/sexually assaulted.""

""Someone tried to hurt me.""

""I've been robbed.""

&amp;#x200B;

After that they may ask more questions such as:

*""Where are you?""*

*""What's your name?""*

*""What does your attacker look like?""*

Etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Please be as clear as possible while remaining in a safe area or getting away from your attacker. Give as much information as you can. If you don't know where you are, start describing buildings, street signs, and other notable landmarks.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Also be aware that operators are aware of code-phrasing as well! If your attacker is nearby or is watching you (this is most common in kidnapping situations), make up an excuse to call your mom ""so she doesn't worry about you."" ***Dial 911 instead.*** The operator will respond with ""What's your emergency?"" From then on, act like you're talking with you mom. The operators are trained to respond appropriately. They may say something like, ""If you are in trouble say, 'Yes, mom, I got here okay.' Is your attacker in the room? If they are say, 'No, I forgot to do my laundry.'"" 

&amp;#x200B;

These types of calls can range from calling a parent or guardian to ordering a pizza. Just answer the questions how they say to and you'll be fine. Also, you are free to ask time-related questions that fit with your phone call. So if you want to know how long it will be until the police arrive, and you're ""ordering a pizza"" feel free to ask, ""How long is it going to take for the pizza to get here?"" The operator will then tell you an estimated time for when the cops show up. If you are talking to a parent you can ask things like, ""How long will it take you to get to your hotel?"" and the operator will follow along and respond. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4. If you are kidnapped, leave a trail when you can.** 

It is very possible for someone to kidnap you. Human trafficking is at an all time high and is a multi-billion dollar industry filled with individuals and businesses who know how to move you across borders undetected. The most common victims are females and children. Most of these people who are caught are sold into slavery or the sex industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please, if you are taken, ***be cautious*** but do what you can to leave a trail and alert people that you're in trouble. If you stop at a restaurant, wait for someone to come into the bathroom and tell them you need help, or write on the mirror with something that you're in trouble along with your name, description, and attacker's names. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are being transported through airports, security is aware of codes that victims use, the most well-known being the Spoon or Fork. If you are being transported through an area that requires you to step through a metal detector, grab a spoon or fork or something metal and stick it in your pockets. When you are confronted about the object refuse to take it out. Security will then take you into a room separately and ask you questions. There you can tell them you are being kidnapped. *I'm not sure what the protocol is for going across land boarders such as from America into Canada or into Mexico. If anyone knows how to deal with that then please comment below!*
