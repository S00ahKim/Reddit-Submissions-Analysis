I don't think they exactly said that Bighit told them not to talk about female idols, but gauging Army's reactions from before, (ie. Hobi's sisters friend getting a crap ton of hate from a few meaningless pictures), I'm leaning towards maybe? I'm not saying they do have a dating ban, I'm just curious, do you think Bighit has enacted a dating ban? They seem really really strict on Bangtan; not letting them leave the house often except for schedules and all. I'm curious, Bangtan doesn't seem to talk about in-house matters unlike GOT7 who has previously talked about the dating ban openly.

I've seen some compare it to the [version of Crow-Tit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1i_x2_TGE0&amp;feature=youtu.be) we got today, so I thought it would be fun to watch the two back to back and see how the kids are different now from how they were in late 2014. 

The biggest difference imo? The maknae line!

Tae is still unpredictable, but a lot more subdued. Jimin is so damn confident now, he just exudes smooth sexiness. But the biggest difference? Jungkook! He's a shy, embarrassed baby in WOH, and now he's.... well.... he's not shy anymore, that's for sure.

I'm 22 I should be done with this type of thing already. But he was cute alright!)... 

Anyway I first watched Dope and was like ""Oh the cop is cute!"" Then she showed me a ""Why Jungkook is the golden maknae"" video and I was like ""yessssssssssssss he's pretty. What's a maknae?"" 

Then I found out how old he is and he became fetus. But I stayed because I love heavy bass lines, and the bass line in Baep Sae and No More Dream stole my breath away.

I personally think its completely stupid. People are  talking about something im not a fan of in a comment section and it IS SO ANNOYING. Like.....really?  You find THAT annoying? (you must not have any siblings m8)

If it were like the MV of another band and ARMYs flooded the comments I would understand, cause thats kinda disrespectful in a way.

But if thats not the case why is it so annoying? Its LITERALLY just mentioning a band. Often people complain about it in videos that actually HAVE BTS mentioned in them.

""OMG am I the only one NOT here cus of bts!? So annoying! "" No, no youre not the only one...calm yer biscuits.

I will admit I used to hate it when ARMYs did this cause I didnt like it that people thought we were annoying, but recently I started to feel that we arent really in the wrong. People who cause a couple of comments about a group they dont care for to affect them SO MUCH, now THATS dumb.

And I dont mean this just for BTS, I mean it for any fandom that experiences this. (Like idk Steven Universe was getting a bunch of hate for being mentioned everywhere on the internet a while back i think?)

What do you guys think? Is it REALLY that annoying?",30,4,False,self,,,,,

All of them are extremely good at dancing. The synchronization is intense. But there will always be the better dancer hehe. Please comment down your opinion and feel free to correct me if I said something wrong!

1. Hoseok
2. Jimin

3. Jungkook

These three would be the top tier.

Hoseok just has that swagger and groove when he dances. I think he did underground b-boying before debut if I'm not mistaken. I'm wondering why he isn't the main dancer. Just curious, no offense. He's so good at freestyling and the music just flows through his body. When I first saw , my eyes unconsciously darted to him because he adds his own style to it especially the sort of head bang (pulling arms dance step) during ""! ! !"". I seriously want to be as good as him hahaha but I can't do his incredible stunts. 
Jimin would be the next one because he also has that swagger but it's just that Hoseok has a wee bit more. I think his built contributes to his dancing in terms of strength and charisma. Since he idolizes Taeyang, he gives off that groovy/sexy vibe as well. (I used to be a Jimin stan)

Jungkook, on the other hand, has very good execution of the steps. He's also charismatic but I read somewhere that he has trouble with freestyling. If that is true, then we're sort of the same. But if it isn't, the ranking wouldn't change.

4. Taehyung

I'm a Taehyung stan and I honestly think he can (not should) join the dancer line. I know he's better at singing than dancing but he's not awkward and he executes the steps well! I can see that he sometimes ""locks"" and gives a stiff torso-ish vibe but I think that's his style (like sort of a hiphop style). This looks so biased but I swear it isn't! Haha. If bts wasn't a dance/hiphop group, I think he can be part of the dancer line.

5. Yoongi
6/7. Jin
6/7. Namjoon

When I first knew BTS, I thought everyone was a good dancer but throughout watching reality shows and dance videos, I realized some were not that fluid. Yoongi is not that bad for me, he dances as if he loves dancing (not that he doesn't but you get what I mean). I didn't think he would be cast as one of the ""bad dancers"" during bts shows. Jin can be awkward but he's improving! Namjoon is stiff at times (especially in INU's body rolls) but he does the steps enough to be synchronized with them.

I only saw one video where each member is asked one question and Jungkook's was ""what is perfume to you?"" And he answered, ""important"". Then that's it. I don't remember anyone claiming to have a thing for perfumes. I saw the Army 3rd kit pic where there's perfume in Hoseok's bag. I envision Namjoon to like perfumes the most but that's just a guess.

I've stanned quite a lot of groups since 2009 and I only got to FULLY know BTS since their INU era, and it baffles me that they are completely different from other typical groups! I

1. Artistry
They write their own music. They are very much involved in songwriting, producing, composing, and choreographing. They don't do things half-assed and is fully committed to their work. Their concepts are true to their heart and pretty mature and relevant. 

2. Brotherhood
There are no cliques. No one is awkward with another. Just genuine friendship!

3. Less censorship, more reality
They're quite open with stuff that most groups aren't, like jokes, insults, and especially talking about girls.

(Edit: I know that other groups may have one/some/all of these, for the lack of a better term,  characteristics as well. This is merely an emphasis that they *DO* have ALL of these and I/we appreciate it.)

I look up to them so much and I just witness their hardship more than other groups. Maybe because they upload more often (bangtan bombs, etc) so we get to see more of what they do (and the reason why it's hard to catch up if you're gone for just a week so even watching random videos make you learn more of them every day)? I like them as a group so much that even if I am a Taehyung stan, I prefer getting their group photocard more than just an individual photocard. I would gladly patronize their albums and concerts knowing that my money's getting its worth.

Getting to know them was the best thing in stanning in the kpop scene so far because it made the other groups that I love look like trash hahaha not gonna mention any names though. I see them promoting for a long time and not disbanding anytime soon but who knows? 

What's your opinion? 

(Edit: There's a reason why I did not mention any group or solo idol and why I posted here on r/bangtan and not on r/kpop. I did not want to compare to ALL the groups out there, but just the groups that I stanned. I did not mean for my post to sound as if BTS is unreachable. I am not claiming that the other groups do not have as talented rappers/composers/dancers/singers as BTS has. I am well aware that idols are trained and is still training to hone their talents and improve their skills. I hope I clarified things and did not put any group in a negative light.)

This show was not edited, so they couldn't edit it to look funny, while like on a show like Weekly Idol, when the MC's are rude (and they TOTALLY are, at least by Western standards) they add a laugh track, edit in a clip of the Idol laughing and everyone's good! 

While Jungkook looked uncomfortable, as he probably was, he was the youngest on the show. He can't talk back or poke fun because he's the youngest and a newcomer. In an international mindset, a lot of countries tend to be extra respectful of youngins. You know we let the kids eat first at the family BBQ, the youngest goes first when playing a board game...  In Korean society, it's all about the elders. I can see why the older people were making fun and saying that the show won't be all about Jungkook. This guy, who is the youngest in the group is also the most popular. They're probably kind of like ""What the heck?! He's a child!""

In ARMY world, and Bangtan World, Kookie is the Golden Maknae who all the boys treat with the utmost respect and definitely don't treat him like a traditional maknae - not like the way Got7 treats Yugyeom. At least they don't on camera, so we're just not used to it. Anything less then treating Kookz like a little prince (which he is :D That kid is a gem) then we get upset.

But don't think for a second I'm not very Western-mindedly riled up about poor Jungkook!! Poor little baby bunny. I'm just attempting to be culturally sensitive.

**K-pop arrives in France**


It doesn't matter that the English oral exam is tomorrow, it was unthinkable for Laurine and Mallorine to miss out on the biggest KPop event in Europe. They were happy to have bought tickets for KCON Paris, (something about president of S.Korea visiting). From 6 o'clock in the morning two schoolgirls aged 17 were in front of lAccor Hotels Arena de Bercy so they can experience pop culture that land of calm morning can offer.


Neither has set foot in S.Korea but they know all their boy bands. They are the most impatient to see BTS, a hip hop group of seven boys who are the biggest stars at the moment.


(There were fans from all over France and Europe)

(A guy from CJ said that 10 000 seats sold out in 3 hours)

(Something about how new groups promote before debut)

(Something about what this girl feels while listening to Kpop and how she wants to visit S. Korea)

(BTS was put together by their company + some annoying bullshit)

**Namjoon**: For me, since Namjoon is UB and I adore his taste in music, he's the one member I think about recommending songs to most. I've already implored him to check out a band on Twitter (lol, that was embarrassing, but still, I wonder if he ever saw it *sighs wistfully*), and I'd love to recommend the same band to you, along with a few others!

* The first band I'd recommend to him (which I did on Twitter already, lol) is Phony Ppl- they've got that jazzy hip hop sound that I think he'd really be into, given his appreciation for Dilla, and I think he might've mentioned Nujabes as well? Not sure. But he's also into Pro Era and Joey Bada$$ (yeah, BEAST COAST), and Phony Ppl run in the same circles.  First song I'd recommend is [Why iii Love The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOD9f7wM8W0)...everything about this song is so dope, and the video is so cute. Second would be [Statues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBMk9BppEUI)- it's one of my favorites. Last song would be [Told You So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zgWvV_1rNs)- it's just a total jam. 
* I'd recommend SBTRKT- [Something Goes Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJt-x6dEjRM) because I think he'd be really into the beat and lyrics.
* Even though it's a heartbreaking song, I'd recommend [Helicopter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5RzpPrOd-4) by Deerhunter. It's gorgeous, but the lyrics are a bit gut-wrenching. However, I think he'd appreciate that, and (judging from his writings on fan cafe posts) perhaps identify with them a little like I do at times.
* I'd love for Namjoon to listen to Beach House, and particularly [Lover of Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaUbNqJDdzQ). I think he'd be drawn into the song by the beat, and would like the unique vocals (oh Victoria Legrand, please marry me already). Then we can talk about how their song [Silver Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnpk4iGvmEw) was used as a sample in Kendrick Lamar's [Money Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whyRZ1zzIRM).
* I would recommend THEESatisfaction's song [Existinct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d9ZqoWh1E)- seems right up his alley, as he's really into Janelle Mone.
* [Powa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLb8jWYvYmU) by tUnE-yArDs...I think this kid would *love* these lyrics, hahahaha. Also the song is just funky, the beat is excellent, and Merrill Garbus's voice is out of control good. 
* [No Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua5pwuxh64Q) by Little Dragon- I think he'd love Yukimi's vocals a lot.
* I think Namjoon would be into [Lofticries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_1obKl8COs) by Purity Ring...great beat, interesting lyrics, and lots of interesting things going on in the track.
* I think [Blessa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C08ucWQ6tCo) by Toro y Moi is the kind of song Namjoon would be able to relax to. 
* And finally, [Re: Stacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhDnyPsQsB0) by Bon Iver...I imagine him putting this on and kind of tuning out for awhile, putting him in the mood to write. Lol, I think about this kid way too much, obviously.

**Taehyung**: Taehyung seems like a bit of a wildcard to me...I'm not really sure what ties together all the songs I'd recommend him, but it's more of a *feeling* than anything else.

* Sleigh Bells- [Tell Em'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iI606ERE6Y): I can see Tae jamming *so hard* to this beat and loving the vocals. 
* I think Vampire Weekend's [Diplomat's Son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKGaZu9y9E) would match well with Taehyung. Something about it just seems so...him, you know? It's relaxed, positive, a bit funky...it's like Tae in song form, lol. I'd also be interested in his take on the lyrics.
* I think Taehyung would love this performance of [Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJIgTLe0hc) by Lalah Hathaway and Snarky Puppy. Talented vocalists seem to grab his attention, and I think he'd be impressed by her vocal technique. I mean, this woman sings *a chord*. Think about that for a second. Also, Snarky Puppy just kills it in the background.
* I know everyone already knows Beyonce, but I'm wondering if they've given Solo a listen as well. If not, I think Taehyung would really like [Losing You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy9W_mrY_Vk) by Solange. It's such a bop, I can picture him grooving to it :)

**Hobi**: I would recommend Robyn's [Fembot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6HI37GLPu8), because I can imagine him dancing to it and becoming almost a guilty pleasure song for him, lol.

**Jungkook**: Given his penchant for female vocalists and stripped down songs, I think Jungkook would *love* [Let It Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlaLwIYEq0U) by Feist, and honestly, I would die a little if he ever covered it.

Arriving.[Just the usual.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujWLEfq0lWg) And then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXHzDd0ztZ0) happens. It's all documented so we get shots from the [inside](https://twitter.com/veluved/status/740453846510669824) of the mosh-pit too. About [how](https://twitter.com/bts_jjam/status/740453611080192002) Jimin [fell](https://twitter.com/NARINS0428/status/740447678283276288). Getting closer to the exit [now](https://twitter.com/jjeonfires/status/740430870335655936). Aaaand they are [out](https://twitter.com/SAI_1126/status/740468387642540032). Another [angle](https://twitter.com/only_bangtan_/status/740474932459511808).

Also don't forget Jungkook who arrived later because he was in Jeju. [This](https://twitter.com/GoldenJK0901/status/740475870008074240), [this](https://twitter.com/GoldenJK0901/status/740478301257404416),[this](https://twitter.com/yeon_hee95/status/740483096609361921) and [this](https://twitter.com/GoldenJK0901/status/740490125768032256) is what it should have looked like for the six of them too.

I ""love"" how fansites still try to make it look like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkaHsxMWgAIw-KR.jpg) when it looked liked [this](https://twitter.com/BTS_BiTS/status/740490912757780480). Respect for the boys for being so damn [calm](https://twitter.com/BTS_BiTS/status/740490158248583168) and [professional](https://twitter.com/BTS_BiTS/status/740485375777329152).Also that  huge ARMY Bomb balloon is not that huge now in retrospect. But it was probably made by the nice part of the Taiwanese ARMYs attending the concert so I didn't mean to generalize or anything. 

Sorry for the long and sarcastic post (this is how I cope with things). And I would like to say that ""I get it, maybe you can't attend the concert and this is your only chance to see them"" but I can't. I think the distance from the second video would have been the appropriate one.

Like many Kpop fans,  I listened to the new EXO  album today, and liked several songs. One song, ""They Never Know"" immediately struck me as being similar to ""Dead Leaves""....the intro to the song in particular, and also throughout the song in general. I know that ""Dead Leaves"" itself is similar to another song that came out earlier last year called ""Dead Roses"" by Blackbear. Though I'm not clear on the technical jargon, I'm pretty sure that what's happening is essentially three different parties buying the same beat/melody or using a free beat/melody? Something like that. The point is, I'm pretty sure anyone making music could access this. And I'm not putting blame on anyone.  I would just like to have this discussion in light of the many, frankly ruthless and unrelenting, accusations of BTS plagiarizing other groups. Dead Roses was in another genre altogether. To have 2 huge Kpop groups with very similar sounding songs from rival companies...it's pretty careless on the latter producer's part, which in this case would be whoever produced the EXO track. Let me know your thoughts! This is *not* meant to start any trouble with other fandoms, please. I really like EXO, and in general like and am excited for this comeback. Thanks.

Im currently on holiday in Tokyo till 22nd and quite coincidentally BTS was coming here for a collaboration concert with a local band called boys and Men. I figured I should try my chances so I walked into the ticket agency yesterday to ask if there were tickets for sale . You couldn't probably imagine how surprised and over the moon I became after she told me yes! So I quickly bought one and the seating is not even bad! 30rows from front right in the middle! I was a bit upset knowing tickets werent sold out but I'm happy I secured one as a result. 

So this morning I headed out early to Tokyo international forum to check out the venue (concert starts at 2) I got there at 11. There were some fans around but not a lot. I can see most were here for BTS instead of the local band  I then literally spent hours sitting outside the entrance for performers with other fans hoping they'd show up there but we gave up at about 1:30 LMAO ! 

At exactly 2 we were let into the concert hall. There were 2 booths to buy goods from.  Unfortunately there was only a photo book full of Japanese texts so I didn't get it. There were 7 boxes for fans to drop gifts purchased for the members (which I thought was really cute) . Then at about 3 the concert started!  Unfortunately the hall wasn't filled out however 90% were BTS fans as I could see army bombs everywhere!  I was proud.  

The opening act was by a local band followed by Boys and Men who did about 10 songs. I tried to be polite but I literally cringed sometimes Hahahahahhah then 1.5hours later BTS finally showed up! They wore the pink suits they wore once (can't remember when)  and started with run and baepsae . The fanchants were great and deafening! I was too hyped and overwhelmed and teared up hahahahahha 
Then they did a few of their Japanese songs IE for you and ended the show with INU and dope.  I was a bit disappointed that they didn't do any new songs but then I think maybe that's how it works for Japanese market maybe?  They need to release fire Japanese version first?  I dk . With that being said it was totally unreal to catch them live. Jimin is really tiny , he is so cute though I just want to kidnap him haha Kookie is so good looking and his live is good!  Rapmon has a good stage presence even though he isn't my bias.  Jin did the signature traffic dance at the start and everyone had a good laugh. Suga was so cool and direct I love him for that.  V was full of mischief as usual. J hope was hilarious af I really enjoyed watching him. Overall they are so much fun to watch (as expected)  and their stage persona is just like their everyday persona , nothing seems pretentious,  it felt so familiar. Argggg I can't blab on I'm just so excited and couldn't believe this. Thanks for reading if you manage to get thru this at all haha ",8,23,False,self,,,,,

I think that although this song is really well loved, people aren't really talking about the social issues these lyrics bring to light. I will admit, the FANTASTIC bass line had me distracted for a little while before I actually delved into the meaning behind the text. 

There are so so so many social justice issues surrounding education/the work field in Korea (if you know even a little about the 8am-10pm school day for students or the conditions the majority of KPop and KDrama stars are forced to work in, you can just imagine the requirements of other careers in Korea). 

These lyrics are AMAZING and make me love BTS's message even more because they are actually actively calling out the social injustices and calling this generation to turn against the systems that, as RapMon so eloquently said in the song, the people that came before us want to maintain. This song is definitely directed at Korean youth, but I feel like they can definitely apply to the social systems that are currently in place in different cultures world wide.

The other day i was watching [this video highlighting Jimin's high notes in Let Me Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgyLhECCZlE) and I couldn't help but notice how much he struggles phisically to hit the notes and even then it doesn't sound as good as the studio version.

I'm no expert but I read he doesn't have a good vocal technique and I'm worried that this might hurt his vocal chords permanently.

From what I've seen they're constantly rehearsing their choreos but we rarely see them training their voices, American Hustle comes to mind but that was a one time event.

Fine.

Being a little jealous that Korean ARMYs have easier access to them (that's not even always the case). Sure.

Getting mildly annoyed at crazy fans. Alright.

But why the super long blog posts and videos and enraged comments about what the other fans are doing? I think that every fan base on earth is like this. The smaller the fan base, the more tame the fans. The bigger the base, the more crazy fans enter the fandom. The craziness is a testament to how quickly the boys are growing. It's both a blessing and a curse on their part but I'm beyond sure they are aware that not all ARMYs are crazy. 

What gets me tilting my head is when people say things like ""I don't know why ARMYs are doing this..."" ""Some people are making us look so bad..."" ""BTS might stop being as open to ARMYs..."" Did you not expect this to happen eventually?

Guys this is what they love to do. More the majority of idol groups, you can see it in their lyrics, performances, interactions with fans, and with each other that they are living their dream. The KPop world is a difficult world to have a career in. KPop working conditions are usually not good, idols usually only get to sleep on long flights and drives from schedule to schedule, I'm sure the BTS probably gets annoyed of each other (it's IMPOSSIBLE that they never have) and still have to put on a happy face in interviews and things. But through all of it, I still feel the vibrance and realness in their music. 

They are doing what they love. And they obviously love the fans too. People are going to be insane, don't let it floor you and get you upset. We have our own lives to live too and our own dreams to follow! 

This isn't meant to be harsh. I'm just curious. Why are we getting so worked up when we ALL (the boys includes) probably haven 99 other problems and BTS is not one of those?",14,4,False,self,,,,,

However, I was disappointed by the of lack live performances of ""Silver Spoon"" and soon began noticing some other suspicious clues that lead me to believe that it is being censored for expressing controversial ideas, or something.

First of all, like I said there are hardly any videos of live performances for ""Silver Spoon"" online. The only two I could find were these two: 

["" - ,    ! .20160513"" on KBSKpop](https://youtu.be/CvQbAOq3ifA)  

[""160513  BTS - Silver Spoon  (Comeback Stage) @ Music Bank"" on ATV K-Music Live](https://youtu.be/H4Vhj8ZDDaY)

Of course, this could mean that BTS only performed ""Silver Spoon"" twice, although that seems somewhat unlikely to me. However, I noticed something while watching [Bangtan Subs' video](https://youtu.be/4yqdUQcSdFg) of the ""Silver Spoon"" dance practice with English subtitles. In the video, Suga suggests that someone else should do J-Hope's dance solo at the end. J-Hope then follows up by saying ""**Yes, I mean I did it many times! On broadcasts, at our concert...**"". Just to make sure, I also looked around for other translations and found this one by [Army Unnie](https://youtu.be/bQlpxXK1b7U) where J-Hope says ""**Right, I did it a lot at music programs and concerts**"". 

If we take the translation literally (and not as a Korean-to-English quirk or exaggeration) this would imply that BTS have actually performed ""Silver Spoon"" many times. Probably more than twice. If this is true, I might assume that there are other videos of ""Silver Spoon"" that are purposefully not being posted online.

Secondly, in the two videos we have, I noticed a cut that skips a large portion of the song (by zooming in on Jin's adorable face!). If you compare them with the lyrics, you'll notice that two of Jungkook's sections are pushed together. If you refer to an excerpt of the lyrics that I posted below, the two normal sections are sung by Jungkook, while everything struck through is not included in the videos:

If you are watching closely, you can also notice how the positions of the members don't quite match up between cuts. In comparison, if you watch the Dance Practice version posted on the official [Bangtan channel](https://youtu.be/V1i_x2_TGE0) or the versions with English subtitles (posted above), they have the full song with choreography.

As a final observation, the KBSKpop performance video (posted above) of ""Silver Spoon"" has comments disabled. However, as it seems that many other videos on that channel, including performances from other groups, also have the comments disabled, I can't really see that as a sign of anything.

And that's what I've found! To me, it seems like something sketchy is definitely going on but honestly I could just be paranoid lol. If you guys spotted anything else that I didn't, please let me know!

TL;DR: It looks like videos of ""Silver Spoon"" are purposefully not being posted, or are being censored by media corporations. I spent way too much time looking into this.",10,1,False,self,,,,,

MM: This song created a bit of fanwar between EXO fans and BTS fans. Can you shed any light on that?  

MZMC: I'd love to! So, producers often use what are called sound libraries. These libraries include different drum sounds, drum loops, synth loops, guitar loops, piano loops, etc. They're shared across the web for producers to use, for free, without having to credit or ask for permission from the original maker of that sound or loop. They're royalty free. So, if a drum sound or a loop is hot, they'll often get used by multiple producers. The electric piano loop that I used was from one of those sound libraries. Since I don't listen to every single Kpop song that gets released, I was unaware that BTS' song,  (Dead Leaves), had the same loop. A lot of fans think that both the producer of Dead Leaves and I sampled Blackbear's Deadroses. That's not the case. It just turned out that all three of us used the same loop from the same sound library.

I did not purchase the ARMY Kit since I thought that the fan cafe questions were gonna be easy to answer, and the only difficulty would be the Korean. Oh, boy was I wrong! Even if you do understand Korean, you are going to have a hard time answering those questions. I had to answer a question that asked who recommended this song at what date? I thought Tumblr would be a big help, but no. Tumblr pages usually never put the title of the song in the descriptions, they just put the picture. I was not going to go through the archives of BTS Tumblr pages just to look for a picture that might be posted in 2015 or 2014. The questions are so specific that it just felt like a waste of time. Another one was asking me to find the tweet that included this picture which will give me a hint to answer another question. LIKE NO!! ABSOLUTELY Not, unlike some people I find my life very precious. I want to live my life as fully as possible but answering those questions is asking me to waste 4 years of my life for more pictures. So therefore, this long rant is simply to tell you that if you do want to level up, you have two choices: Pay for the army kit that will waste your money (my personal preference) or answer those fan cafe questions that will waste your time. So now I whole heartedly believe that the fancafe is not only for Koreans, but also for international fans since the questions are so hard even if you are Korean that you are better off paying for the ARMY Kit.",5,23,False,self,,,,,

It was my first indoor arena concert experience as well. First huge convention. I had the most incredible time- I wouldn't have traded anything. 

What I want to know is, for everyone that went- how are you doing? I am personally trying to keep it together, but I'm experiencing post-concert sadness pretty hard- I watched the livestream of Bangtan's performance and  felt like crying. It was so amazing IRL! 

I also want to know- who struck you the most in person? Namjoon is my UB, and on the first night when he made the surprise appearance as MC my soul left my body, I was so shocked. I hadn't expected anything BTS until Saturday, so it was so UNFAIR and RUDE that they would surprise us all like that! And of course he was perfect during the concert. But I have to say that during the fan engagement, and during the red carpet, and in the concert, the person I just couldn't stop staring at was Hobi! Not that surprising, since he is my firm #2 and I adore everything about him, but in person he's just killer. I dunno...he glows, man. Like an angel. Like [actual sunshine](http://i.imgur.com/KFGMZlch.jpg). He's so charming- during the red carpet he kept throwing hearts and smiling so widely...his smile is the most infectious thing! I was fangirling so hard...even though I had a necklace with Namjoon's face on it (don't judge me) and was holding up a fan that said Rap Monster on it, I kept screaming for Hobi, lol. 

And I met so many cool fellow ARMYs! And personally, one of the most exciting things about the entire convention was how many sheet masks I acquired. Omg, I got so many. Like almost 30. Some I bought, some I hustled for (filled out surveys, among other things). My skin feels like a soft newborn lamb. Made of clouds. Or something.

First completed shirt. Watercolour style was cool and all but it failed too many times for me. So I decided to go with basic acrylic. 

I learned a lot from this and hopefully will have another BTS trash shirt with wicked colours.

Check out /r/bleachshirts to see awesome shirt designs.

1. Stencil is freezer paper bought on Amazon. 

2. Acrylic paint and paintbrush from dollar store

3. Fabric medium from Amazon

I've been a lurker here for some weeks, and thought I should introduce myself. English is not my first language, so I apologize if something sounds a bit weird.

I actually just discovered BTS one month ago. I watched a video of people reacting to Kpop songs, 'Dope' catched my attention, searched it and I haven't stopped listening to them since then. Serendipity. 

Now, this is a bit weird. I'm 22, and I'm completely new to Kpop. I knew about it, but in the past I had just digged another side of the Korean culture. I'm a huge fan of cinema, and Korean cinema has been booming for the last decade, Kim Ki-duk, Bong Joon-ho and Lee Chang-dong being my favourites. So that was just basically my only contact with South Korea, that and a close friend I made while living abroad (I don't live in my home country). I had listened to two or three famous Kpop songs some years ago but I didn't even know the name of the groups. I've also never been a fan of any boy group or girl group. Let alone that pop is not a genre I especially like. But BTS made such impression on me that I can't explain it. And I don't feel embarrassed at all when I tell people I like them, I don't care about the prejudices they can hold. I guess it's their music mixed with their personalities what made me so keen on them. They are just absolutely lovely, and I love their songs. Also discovering them during a harsh moment in my life and finding myself completely alone in a foreign country, made me get 'attached' to them in a way. Many times they made my days a bit brighter, or I stopped feeling so lonely. And I feel that as something weird, because I never thought I could become such a 'fangirl' of someone in the sense that I feel fond of these guys I never exchanged a word with, and I truly wish them all the best.

So that's it. Life improved a bit since I discovered them. What about you? How did you discover them? Did they it change something in your life? Probably there is already a post about all this though.

Also, how the hell can you choose a bias!?

Oh, and do you guys have some kind of App chat group or maybe we can make one? I'd love to meet people I can fangirl with.",43,15,False,self,,,,,

- [Fan Engagement](https://youtu.be/NPwtWjIdXXY) - (1080p) Ending Ment for the Fan Engagement

- [Rap Monster as MC - RM Focus](https://youtu.be/ooBsWE-P2Ic) - (1080p60fps)

- [Intro &amp; FIRE](https://youtu.be/8dBAOpV3aE8) - (1080p60fps) When the confetti/string came out I got tangled in it and it was hard to move around so thats why I was spazzing @3:00

- [SAVE ME](https://youtu.be/dxVqP3dbD-0) - (1080p60fps) I wasn't able to record the entire song in one video, but I put together the ones I had so that there are only a couple seconds of the song missing

- [Ment 1](https://youtu.be/Bhu-KNPuxcY) - (1080p60fps) as you can hear I was having a serious fan girl moment during this, but how could I not when they were THIS CLOSE!!

- [Boyz with Fun](https://youtu.be/XyAeizZThtE) - (1080p60fps) probably the least shaky and stable video I took all night besides Cypher. Jimin and Jungkook snuck up @3:05 and I almost died.

- [Cypher PT.3 : KILLER](https://youtu.be/qgioyfbYLjs) - (1080p60fps) YESSSSSSSSSS.

- [Ment 2](https://youtu.be/dJhPnEpZHIQ) - (1080p60fps) Last Ment

- DOPE - My phone was launched forward and landed under the stage during this song so i didn't get the entire song, if you guys want I can edit what I have together but for now I just won't upload it.

I'll upload the Ending Stage with all artists later on so I'll edit that in when I do!",10,17,False,self,,,,,

So my friend got an Epilogue: Young Forever album in the mail today, but to her surprise and dismay it seems a lot like a fake.

The most obvious thing identifying it as a fake is a picture of JHope in the photo book is captioned 'Sugar', which obviously isn't even Yoongi's stage name - two big red flags right there. Also, some pages were slightly stuck together and she claims the printing and gloss on the front cover seems to be a little off. She has also claimed that the print quality in the photo book appears grainy. There were also stickers, which she said weren't normally included in these albums. 

However, there is still a gold sticker on the album saying 'C1' which is found on the legit albums.

Some people online say that 'C1' indicates 1 CD in the album, which would be incorrect as there were 2. But other sources say that 'C1' indicates where it was made, in which case it may be legit.

It was bought off Amazon from JYONLINE EU.

Can anyone offer any insight into this? Does anyone know of/bought products from JYONLINE EU?",7,5,False,self,,,,,

I knew I would barely survive, but I REALLY almost passed out. I was screaming so hard I started to feel light headed.

I went to KCON NY last weekend (I want to go back) and I was floored by all the other performances. But nothing compared to BTS. I have been a HUGE Ed Sheeran fan, for about 5 years, since before he became mainstream and I cried 3 times when I first saw him in concert. He is still my all time favorite singer songwriter, but my reaction to him was still nothing compared to BTS.

The first night of KCON, when RapMon surprised the audience as an MC, I thought my heart was going to fall out of my chest. It was beating so hard. It was so cool getting to see him live and hear his slurred, swagged out English while playing it up with AILEE who I also adore. My reaction to him, without the others, not even performing, was stronger than my reaction to Ed Sheeran who I had been stanning for 5 years. I have only been an ARMY for 5 months. I had no idea how I would survive the whole group.

The next day, throughout Day 6's whole performance, I felt like I was going to poop my pants. I could barely focus on them (although now I have their latest album on repeat) because I knew BTS was coming out next. I was hyperventilating during their intro on the screen, I started randomly jumping and screaming - still haven't seen them at this point - I swear I was going to burst a blood vessel when Suga's name came on the screen. Then when Fire started and they came through the floor, and J-Hope started his whooping I started making noises that I didn't know I could possibly make. I couldn't take my eyes off my Sugz (as I call him to myself) or Hobi the whole time. During Killer and really the whole set, I almost lost it at how super sexy and confident Suga was. Ughhhh it was difficult to stomach. And J-Hope's very presence in real time solidified the fact that he had somehow become second bias. WHY. Those ripped light washed jeans on both Suga and J-Hope were a great idea. Applause to you Big Hit stylists. 

And then when RapMon said ""We have one song left to go! Are you guys ready?!"" I screamed ""NOOOO!"" But really I was. They killed it. They almost killed me and I was in a P3 seat. I have never reacted to anyone or anything the way I did to BTS. 

It was ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. And great.

What was your first reaction? Who couldn't you keep your eyes off of? What did you take away from the performance?",5,12,False,self,,,,,
