Did anyone else have trouble getting their tickets? We were going for VIP+, but by the time we got in to purchase we only got VIP...and then evidently everything was gone in 25 mins. I read somewhere that the waiting room assigned you a random place in line, and even people who were there when it opened didn't get tickets at all. :( It was such a weird process...just wondering how everyone else fared!",16,5

As you all probably know, Bangtan's new album dropped a few hours ago, and I only listened to it twice, but I must say: I'm not disappointed. What do you all think of it? 

EDIT: 

Sales began and I decided to check a few international iTunes stores. Right now (about 33 hours after the release), the album is

* #94 on [iTunes UK](http://i.imgur.com/6EeCLib.png)

As for South Korea, China, Japan: I can only navigate through the Japanese iTunes store and there, the album is not even among the top 200. But other than that... I think they're doing well. Let's do this, people!! ",6,7
