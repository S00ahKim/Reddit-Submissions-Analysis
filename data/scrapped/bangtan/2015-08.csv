If you know one is missing, feel free to mention it below and I'll add it.  

Spoilers for how well/not well they do in the actual competitions!

I'll try to link to the original uploader when possible, but if I didn't on accident (or I just can't find it), please let me know! (Pictures are a little more difficult for me to find :( ) Now here's the list:

And now for the best collection of fancams; Jin's fancams. Jin was so hyper and excited the whole ISAC!! He looked like he was doing what he was born to do; be Bangtan's cheerleader and soccer mom. He waved his army bombs everywhere! Honestly I fell even more in love with Jin from these fancams (and he was already near the top).
