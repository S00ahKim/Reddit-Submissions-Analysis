I couldn't sleep last night and ended up thinking about BTS collabs. They're definitely focusing on American artists now, but I wonder if they'll ever collab with other Korean artists and other countries?

For Korea, I would do *anything* for BTS (or just rapline) to collab with BAP (or just Yongguk.) Yongguk writes and produces all the songs for BAP and both groups have such versatile, but also hip hop-based, styles that I think it'll be interesting. They both talk about mental health and other problems as well, which could be so powerful. 
~~But then, if there's a Yongguk/RM collab, the rap would probably be way too poetic and deep to understand.~~
(They actually [collabed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1BKO3KxOLA) but it was so messy)

For other countries, I personally would like to see BTS vocal-line collab with Hua Chenyu, a cpop singer. He makes crazy remixes and has a unique style which may or may not fit well with BTS.",155,40

First off, yes I am an outsider with no real idea of BTS. You'll likely find me on r/StarTrek instead. But I've ventured over to your arm of the galaxy to request some assistance. 

My sister is turning 17 and breaths BTS and Jungkook. She's an awesome sister as well as human and I really want to get her something nice, but BTS does not appear to be coming to Detroit any time soon and when I look online all I can find are shirts and other odd items. But what is it that the true BTS fan yearns for? One thing that came to mind, but appears to be impossible, would be to get Jungkook to send her some kind of personalized message.

What is your equivalent to me getting a screen quality scale model of the U.S.S. Enterprise? Time is not an issue since, for the right gift, she can wait. I just want to solidify my place as her favorite brother, that's all. :) 


Thanks!!!",66,121

This kind of interaction makes me soft for my own fandom.

Selling the official Wings Tour Ticket album. It originally sold for $30+shipping, but since mine is used (still good condition though!), I'm selling for $15 plus shipping. I basically used it to store photocards since it's perfect for that, and you can do the same! I'll also throw in a bunch of freebies (fanmade stickers and photocards)

Of course, when we talk about BTS, we can not NOT talk about the lyrics. (Don't worry, I do search up the lyrics and the meaning, especially for BTS songs. They changed me in that way. Plus it definitely gives their songs a deeper meaning.)  However, I am very interested to see what people's opinions are when they first heard their songs without knowing what it means.

""These boys, like their song, really did work hard while spilling their blood, sweat and tears~ I'm so happy that everything turned out well.""   
&amp;nbsp; 

There is a person that the BTS members (RMSugaJinJ-hopeJiminVJunkook) call ""auntie."" She is Ms. Kang Sun-ja, who operates 'Yoojung Sikdang,' which specializes in Grilled Black Pork Belly, in Nonhyeon-dong, Gangnam-gu ward of Seoul. Ms. Kang, who has watched the members from their trainee days, has said that BTS's growth into worldwide stars felt exceptionally special. Reminiscing about BTS, whom she always believed would do well but could have never imagined their [current] level of success, Ms. Kang said ""They really worked hard. I'm so happy that they are doing well"" with a twinkle.  
&amp;nbsp; 

In the past, Yoojung Sikdang was introduced as a restaurant frequented by the members on their real variety program [Rookie King]. In 2013, freshly debuted BTS would describe it as ""a place to go when you're missing your mom's home cooked meal."" To the boys, who had to leave their hometowns and live apart from their parents for a long time, Ms. Kang's food was, most likely, not just simply ""restaurant food.""  
&amp;nbsp; 

5 years later, it has become a place for ARMY (fans of BTS) to find a trace of BTS. Everyday, the restaurant is full of fans who come from all over the world to eat the ""BTS Special."" The interior is filled with BTS memorabilia, sincerely decorated by fans wishing BTS well.  
&amp;nbsp; 

While BTS can't come often like they once did, they still come every once in awhile, despite their busy schedule. The members even have their own seats. Their practice room was in the basement of the same building and they always sat down in the same order, as if they were reserved. Ms. Kang can still remember clearly, the members of BTS sharing their hopes and dreams in this place. With a thankful heart, Ms. Kang relayed ""I've received so much more from the members than I was able to give.""   
&amp;nbsp; 

The following is a Q &amp; A with Ms. Kang.  
&amp;nbsp; 

**Q: How long have you known the members?**  

A: It's been around 7 years since I've known them. Whether it's now or then, they always tried their best. The seven of them took care of each other well and their friendship was great. When they would come hang out after practice, they would eat really deliciously.  
&amp;nbsp; 


**Q: BTS's success must feel extra special to you?**  

A: I can't even describe with words how happy I am. The boys have experienced many hardships. They really tried hard, spilling their blood-sweat (t/n: Korea's version of the phrase ""Blood, Sweat, Tears""). Every time I cooked them a meal, I did so with my heart wishing, ""Please let them eat this food and do well."" Because they have proved that if you put in the effort, you will surely be repaid, it feels great.  
&amp;nbsp; 


**Q: As ""BTS"" becomes famous, fans from all over the world have come to visit.**  

A: I am so thankful. Because they have come for BTS, I try to treat the fans well.  
&amp;nbsp; 


**Q: Do the members of BTS still visit?**  

A: They came very often while they were trainees. Now days, they are so busy that it's hard to see their faces but their managers will sometimes come and bring them take-out.  
&amp;nbsp; 


**Q: Do you have any words for BTS?**  

A: I am receiving exponentially more love than I was able to give [to you]. I don't know how to convey my gratefulness. I am sincerely thankful and happy. I wish for the members to always be healthy. I love you. Congratulations on your recent daesang!

2 Cool 4 Skool : (facepalm at the cool spellings) Circle room Cypher, baby bangtan with their ideas of cool, plus a rare Jin and Jimin freestyling.

O!RUL8,2? ( double facepalm) We On, one of my favorite songs from their older albums. Sadly a lot of the people have never heard and there are not many live performances of this. One of the original BTS diss tracks, I wonder how well it would do if this song was released today. Plus, RM compares short education to Capri pants. Lyrical genius. Also N.O is an overlooked title track, asking real questions

Skool Luv Affair: ( sigh.... just sigh) I have one word for you... JUMP JUMP JUMP... one of the first Suga tracks, fun performance and a proper hype song. Just lost in the tide of time. I would love to see them perform this in newer concerts. 

Dark &amp; Wild: ( fist pump... we are getting there) INTRO: What am I to you? True BTS style. RM word play, the turn in the vibe of the song. Brilliance. Watch this now, if you havent already

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV8eUGh4cII


HYYH part 1 ( I want to cuddle who ever came up with this album title) I need U was the turning point of their career. Anyone who has followed BTS from the start would be able to see the rise in their desperation during the promotion period of this. But the underrated song Move. I love the song, them wanting to record a significant part of their life in to a permanent record that cannot be lost. 

HYYH part 2: for me this is the perfect BTS album. Nevermind cuts into our soul, the rest of the song follow, the Run Mv was amazing, the reception for this album was amazing. The underrated song in this album is Ma City. Its lyrically brilliant. JHope shines here. A true bop. House of cards is a contender, the vocal line shines hauntingly... I have always felt this song belongs on the OST of Inception

HYYH Young Forever: I wish they had included the Dope Jazz remix

Wings/YNWA :FIRST LOVE.... it deserves more love... Spitfire Suga wrote a song about a brown piano. This is Suga laid bare

Love Yourself: Her  This album. Serendipity was (I am at a loss for words, I was waiting for RM/Suga/ JH to throw us into despair with their words but we get Jimin serenading us) 

LY:H, was an album that left me wanting for more. Something to complete something. I cannot explain what that is. Even during our r/bangtan polls for the best song.... not one song stood out, no song was left out either. Then I realized that the hidden song Sea. The one that completed the album. Like Suga said Mask on Mask off. The false sense of security that DNA and Serendipity bring was hiding Sea. 

These are just my opinions. It was not meant to intrude on any one elses opinions. I would like to now what r/bangtan things of underrated BTS songs

131,2018-2-4,2018,2,4,18,7v5sqk,"180204 Please Increase iHeartAwards Voting: Updates, Caveats, and Maintaining Energy",alexalexi,1517735492,"**Updates:**

1) #2 in Best Fan Army has been increasing their voting rate alongside ARMY's on twitter. We'll need to increase our voting rate in order to maintain (and hopefully increase) the gap.

2) Android users: avoid hidden character after the #iHeartAwards tag that is invaliding votes by manually typing out the tags, copy/paste, or using text replacement

3) #2 in Best Boy Band has not increased their twitter voting rate so that category doesn't appear too alarming yet

&amp;nbsp;

**Caveats:**

1) Twitter data doesn't account for voting restrictions so the current gap may not be as wide as the data shows.

2) We don't have clear data on the other voting platforms so gaps may also exist there.

&amp;nbsp;

To explain the caveats, here's a brief overview of the voting and statistic reporting. Please let me know if you have any additional sources or information, and I will add them to this post. I also didn't include voting instructions as they have already been posted before but please let me know if that would be helpful and I'll add them as well. I added links to the previous posts about the iHeartAwards at the end of this post.

&amp;nbsp;

**Voting Platforms and Restrictions**

*Restrictions are reset daily. They are per user per category per platform.*

1) Twitter (50 combined tweets and retweets)

2) Instagram (50 original posts; comments are not counted)

3) Facebook (50 original posts; comments are not counted)

4) Official Website (50)

&amp;nbsp;

**Voting Statistics**

Sources: https://twitter.com/btsanalytics, https://twitter.com/STATSAWARDS

I recorded the daily summary data from btsanalytics here along with charts if you would like an overall view: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srs6hNmx8TOsPw6gIUsFOC9VzcjinhYYhLo4bVli03A/edit?usp=sharing

**These sources only include raw twitter data.** The accuracy of this data relies on the users voting within the daily limits per account. These areas are excluded:

1) Twitter limits

*For example, if a twitter user tweets 200x for BTS, only 50x will be officially counted but all 200x will appear in the statistics. So if another user only tweets 100x for #2 but uses two accounts to split the votes, the stats will show that BTS is 100x ahead of #2 even though #2 is officially 50x ahead of BTS.*

2) Instagram votes

3) Facebook votes

4) Official website votes

&amp;nbsp;

**Call to Vote!**

BTS tweeted about the iHeartAwards (https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/957795469995814912). Whether or not they end up going, let's try our best to help them win. BTS winning in either category is not guaranteed, especially as voting lasts until 3/5 2PM KST.

&amp;nbsp;

**Maintaining Energy**

I have a basic daily voting routine that I stick to. I think of it as part of my morning email checking routine. If it's a busy day or I am starting to feel overwhelmed / tired, I stick to that basic routine and don't do more until I feel my energy / time come back. If I feel especially bad that day, I concentrate on the Best Fan Army category as it's the one where we appear to need more votes. I also take breaks to watch BTS, hang out with friends, go take a walk, nap, do non-BTS things, etc. in order to decompress.

Please comment below if you have any tips on how to keep up the voting regularly without burning out, or if you are feeling burned out and need some virtual hugs! Thanks for reading this post; ARMY Fighting!!!

Editorial journalists of Kangwondo Min-Ilbo (news outlet) put together a playlist of 10 songs that captured the joy and excitement of the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics through music.  

*(I only translated the part pertaining to BTS)*  
&amp;nbsp;  

**1. Champion (remix) by Fall Out Boy (ft. RM of BTS)**   
&amp;nbsp;  

With a powerful punk-rock sound, the repeated lyrics of 'I got nothing but dreams inside, I can do anything"" seems to represent the cries/shouts of all the athletes who are currently sweating (working hard/preparing) to become champions in Pyeongchang. With rap lyrics written by BTS leader RM, who is also featuring on this remix, we're hoping for the whole world to be as enthusiastic about it in Pyeongchang as they are about BTS.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Rest of the playlist:  
2. Running - S.E.S  
3. Fly - Epik High  
4. Viva La Vida - Coldplay  
5. Hold Your Dream - Fame (2009) Soundtrack  
6. Hall of Fame - The Script  
7. He is from Seoul, She is from Pyongyang - Steve Barakatt  
8. Thank U for - XIA (Junsu)  
9. Play The Game - Queen  
10. Boom Boom Pow - Black Eyed Peas",10,112

* Your motto 'steadily, diligently' stands out.

    ... If you keep doing whatever you do steadily, a 'big hit' will eventually come to you like a bonus to a hard-working person. One should not gamble for one shot. It's a pity that there're people who only aim for that one shot. *BTS have steadily been making good content since their debut and grew to reach where they are now. That's the right thing.* ...

&amp;nbsp;

* It's surprising to see that you don't really care about chart ranking. I thought you'd care about it because you worked with idols.

    Please think that I'm just doing music with idols- without any intention or meaning. Fans who like my music tend to have prejudice against idols. But for me, it's fun to work with them. They are just singers, not idols, when singing my songs. I've heard that Chen of EXO sings well. *Recently I also found out from a news article about Jungkook of BTS^1) .

    1) So this part is not so clearly written as to what exactly he read. I initially thought he read an article on how JK sang along Like It at GDA. But it also could be that he read that he was picked as someone who JK wanted to collaborate with. 

&amp;nbsp;

diminie note: I'm glad that more people recognize how the boys' have always been hard-working and sincere and that they didn't just pop out of nowhere. And, yes, Jong Shin nim.

I'm a relatively new fan and I just had a quick question regarding their concerts. I've heard that getting tickets to their concerts in the US/West in general is an absolute bloodbath and unless you're extremely lucky or spend an absurd amount of money - chances of getting a ticket are pretty low. Does the same apply to their Korean and Japanese shows? I live in Japan (but I'm not Japanese), so an hour flight to Seoul or a drive to Osaka wouldn't be that big of a deal. I speak decent enough Japanese to navigate Japanese ticketing websites, I just want to know if I'd have a better chance shooting for a Korean/Japanese ticket or going for one back in the US.

So while we wait for BTS to drop something (hixtape when?), let's play a game. 

As we all know, our very own Min Yoongi predicted BTS's rise on BB in his iconic Agust D (lol).

So let's take a page from his book and predict what BTS is going to drop first.

 

---

 



 
It's simple:

* **Predict something.** Eg. Hixtape will drop first; A collab will drop first; a cover will drop first; highlight reel, comeback date, etc. 

* **Make sure your prediction is the first of its kind.** If someone else has already made the prediction you were going to make, reply to them and leave your mark.

* **You can only predict one thing.**

* **The deadline is the day BTS drops anything predicted.**

Just have fun with it and be as delulu or realistic as you want lol",106,56

I feel with their gaining success and realizing their dreams makes me look inwards and ask myself 'what are you doing?' I'm sitting on my couch, working from home, and watching Cloverfield (so I suppose I'm already living Yoongi's other dream). I feel like I've been getting this inspired feeling during some of their videos, and its now leaked out in to movies and other parts of life.

I used to work with spray paint a lot. I loved it, even though when a piece would fail I'd be bummed out. But in my current apartment, working with that medium just isn't possible. I like normally painting and other things, but it doesn't give me the same satisfaction of seeing myself continually improve. I already do one of my oldest 'hobbies' for a living, so its not so much a hobby anymore. So I've been trying to think if there is something I've missed out on trying or didn't try enough. But they've really inspired me to seek something that I want to accomplish -- and this time, not for my job or company but something actually for myself that I can be proud of.

So r/bangtan, have you gone out and sought and tried to find something for yourself because of BTS?

**Nominee for Musician of the Year: BTS**  
&amp;nbsp;

From a purely musical standpoint, BTSs virtue lies in the fact that, the more one repeatedly listens to the album, the more one starts to focus on the degree of completeness/perfection. Focusing more and more on album storytelling while at the same time, BTS and Big Hit are becoming more adept at incorporating their world views. In a time of singles and EPs, it is interesting to note the fact that an idol group is the one to be implementing such aesthetics of an album. Created with that kind of effort, even when looking at [LOVE YOURSELF: Her] from the perspective of Pop, not K-Pop, its level of completeness/perfection holds up.

Please read my comment before reading the article translation.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a war cloud hanging over the music industry. Alliances of large music companies and IT companies have been created, changing the market structure. The battle over digital music distribution, featuring money on the front line, has begun. 

SM Entertainment (SM), JYP Entertainment (JYP), and Big Hit Entertainment (Big Hit) partnered with SK Telecom (SKT) on B2B music content distribution and B2C music service platform development on the 31st of last month. This was a reaction against the joint music business of YG Entertainment (YG) and Naver that started last year. SM, YG, and JYP are collectively classified as the Big 3 of the domestic K-POP industry. Big Hit is an emerging power who created BTS, the leader of Hallyu these days.

The reason that these agencies started to cooperate with IT companies is in order to secure a stable platform that meets their taste. It is a strategy to exert power on internet portal sites or in music distribution networks run by major IT companies.

Currently, the music distribution market is unfavorably structured for the agencies. Heres how it works: Agencies transfer the content to a contracted distributor (e.g. Loen Entertainment (Loen), CJ E&amp;M, etc.) who then distributes the content to physical stores or digital music platform (eg. Melon, Mnet music, etc.). SM-JYP-Big Hit are partnering with SKT to get into the music distribution business with Iriver, SKTs subsidiary. It is analyzed that the fact that they are empowering this new distributor (Iriver) shows their solid will to intervene and change the structure of music distribution. A high-ranked person of a medium-sized agency said Ive heard that SM is trying to lower the fees generated through the two-step distribution process by supporting a new distribution network.  

According to those working in music industry, the fee structure is as follows. Based on digital music, the music platforms take 40% of the revenue, and the agency gets 44%, 10~20% of which are paid to the distributor. For example, if the revenue generated from streaming EXOs Growl was 100 KRW (won hearafter), the digital music platform earns 40 won. The distributor earns 6.6 won (based on 15%), and 37.4 won is whats left with SM. 40~50% of the revenue falls into distribution fees. 

Agencies have expressed their complaints about distribution margins. They have requested re-balancing of revenue share, but providers and distributors refused, saying the fees are necessary to invest in and operate online service technology.

[The three paragraphs from here are pretty similar to [the initial news]( https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7u5zwe/180131_sm_jyp_and_bighit_working_with_sk_telecom/dthv4sh/). It says itll be a win-win contract as the agencies will have their voice in the distribution process and SKT will be able to use EXO or Twice, for example, in their marketing.] 

Many say that the alliance of SM-JYP-Big Hit-SKT is created to prevent Kakao-Loen from being too powerful. Loen is growing their size in the music industry by doing planning, distribution (Melon), and management business. IU and JBJ are under their label. Melons position became even more solid after Kakao acquired Loen in 2016. Its highly likely that SM-JYP-Big Hit chose SKT to shake the Melon-centered music distribution industry. However, there are many mountains to cross as its hard to expect that Melon users will migrate to a new platform without perks and benefits. 

One interesting thing is the rise of Big Hit. BTS hit the US and emerged as a new K-POP Hallyu group, Big Hit is still a small company relative to Cube Entertainment and FNC Entertainment. 

There is a hidden story behind the alliance of SM-JYP-Big Hit. In 2010, SM-JYP-YG jointly established KMP Holdings, a physical/digital music distributor, showing their close relationship. However, the situation changed when KT Music acquired KMP Holdings in 2012. SM and JYP eventually gave up their contracts with KT Music last year, but YG decided to renew the contract, ending the alliance of the Big 3. SM chose SKT instead of KT, and YG, who has a strategic alliance with Naver, chose to stay with KT. This happened after Naver announced their investment of 100 Billion won in YG in March of last year. 

YG chose Naver as its business partner not only in music but also to enhance their video content production and distribution. YG is trying to build its own content and distribute it via the portal site instead of relying on traditional broadcasting systems such as KBS, MBC, and SBS. According to the music industry, after the Big 3 alliance broke up, SM and JYP chose Big Hit as their new partner. An anonymous source who has been in the music planning business said that Lee Soo-man, chairman of SM, is the one who planned the new alliance, adding that the relationship between Bang Si Hyuk, CEO of Big Hit, and JYP helped them reach the agreement. SM became the second largest shareholder of Iriver last year. 

The competitive landscape of the K-POP distribution market is now featuring a three-way competition of SM-JYP-Big Hit- SKT, YG-Naver-KT, and Loen-Kakao. Small- and medium- sized agencies are not content with this as they worry that large agencies will take the lead in video content distribution in addition to digital music distribution. Kim Sanghwa, a music critic, said Korea might be the only case where an agency trains singers, controls the digital/physical music distribution, and distributes the content on a platform owned by the company. We should pay attention to the side effects of this vertical integration. ",44,159

&amp;nbsp;

Netmarble Games will release a new game created with the popular idol group BTS in the first half of the year as a new attempt to combine game with K-Pop.

Bang Jun hyuk (*diminie note: he and Bang PD nim are cousins*), chairman of Net Marble's board of directors, held a press conference at Sheraton Seoul Duke City Hotel in Seoul on the 6th and announced the new game 'BTS World' for the first time. The game is an unusual attempt to combine K-POP and K-game, and the gamers are fostering/training BTS. 

Bang said More than 10,000 exclusive pictures and 100 exclusive videos will be included within the game. The members of BTS do photoshoots, act, and record a new song for this game. This is a new attempt to combine music and game.

Bang added I believe the game industry should develop a new genre by cooperating with movie, drama, or performance. Starting with BTS World, we will continue to make new attempts to combine various cultural contents and game ",85,226

2. EXO-L: 97.19M

We know EXO-L seem to flood in with votes towards the end, so while we have a pretty significant lead we could possibly lose it if we don't continue to vote.
 
So keep hash tagging on Twitter and Android users need to know to make sure there isn't a space at the end of your tweet because it won't be counted, at least this was the last bit of info I came across regarding voting on Twitter.

BTS lay out a full-length animation through 'DNA'. 

Each of the seven members is assigned with his own role on the track's flow that is designed for him. The mixing fills the space with rich imaging, highlighting both their characteristics and the message of song at the same time. 

It is worth mentioning, when dealing with a metaphysical and vague material such as the universe or fate, that it is not easy to realize such a three-dimensional effect in a non-ambient genre.

This is meaningful as a musical achievement of BTS themselves and also as a prime example of how technically advanced the production strategy of Korean idol music.

It is a great pop song that will not be forgotten for a while in many ways.

It's relatively new, started end of Nov 2017. The two hosts, Yady and Natalie outta Miami, delve into really interesting topics around BTS, kpop, the music business, fandoms, etc. It's fun, super informative, and they both give truly thoughtful, meaningful analysis on a variety of topics. 

A snippet of the kinds of things they cover off on: 
- Critical analysis of BTS songs, lyrics, melodies, performances, etc. 
- Globalization in music 
- What makes BTS and ARMY different from other kpop groups
- Funny fandom phenomena, like BTSOutcast 
- and so much more.

June of Planetarium Records revealed his connection to BTS.  
&amp;nbsp;

At the Planetarium Records 2nd EP Case #2 showcase, held on the afternoon of the 7th at Hyundai Card Understage located in Yongsan, Seoul, June revealed, Ive worked on BTS and Surans songs.  
&amp;nbsp;

Before June debuted last January as part of Planetarium Records, he participated in writing and composing BTS songs Lost Awake Not Today, Surans Wine and Jung Jinwoos Ill Find You.  
&amp;nbsp;

According to June, BTS Suga sunbaenim and I are close enough to eat together, contact each other and drink together and revealed, he sent me a congratulatory message, Junsuk-ah, congratulations on your debut album.   
&amp;nbsp;

He continued, and said if the opportunity presents itself, lets work [on music] together and added, I think it would be an honor to work with him, not as a songwriter but as a singer.  
&amp;nbsp;

Specifically about the circumstances around working on BTSs songs, he explained, I was a Big Hit trainee but then BangPD invited me to try composing and so I started to compose [for their music].  
&amp;nbsp;

CASE#2 is the 2nd EP album of Gaho, Moti, Villian, Jung Jinwoo, June and Kei-G, six musicians gathered together under the label, Planetarium Records. Starting with [BLIND](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xts0NK5w_xU), the title song, which features all members, the album contains a total of 10 tracks, including solo songs of each musician. It was released at noon on this day.

Don't you guys find it just strange that so many other kpop groups have been named already to be a torch bearer, an ambassador, and/or confirmed to be a part of the opening/closing ceremony, but still we don't get anything related to BTS?

Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of all the other Kpop acts that have been named so far. I like that kpop as a whole is being integrated into the games so as to represent the country, but seriously why is South Korea sleeping on BTS?? I can't imagine this being political because Bang PD is known to be a supporter of the current Moon administration.

I've had high hopes knowing that some of the government officials at the Blue House (Korean equivalent of White House) did a viewing party of BTS's performance on the AMA's. 

Some Korean netizens are very confused by this, and some are even upset. I don't see many international fans talking about this, maybe rightly so as to avoid conflict with other kpop groups.

However, I don't think it's just a naive reason such as RM's getting a nose surgery that they are just not being included in these events. If BTS continues to remain absent, I can only conclude one thing: the major corruption of South Korea's music industry. (I'm not hastily making this conclusion, it's all based on how they've been treated by South Korean media time and time again. And I also acknowledge the possibility that BTS could have declined it themselves, but honestly media corruption is nothing wrong to point out, and a very relevant one to think of in contexts like these).

Also, one very major act DID get added very last-minute to the opening ceremony (Ha Hyun Woo of Gukkasten). He's a legend so not complaining, but I'm unsure if the schedule was 100% set in stone.

Thoughts?

(Not looking for hate, okay? I've been just very confused by this).

EDIT:  I realize I may have started this discussion a bit prematurely  and should have waited until the games are officially over. But I still think that the act of raising such questions itself doesn't undermine the integrity of ARMY or any other fandoms involved (like I said, I'm immensely proud of all the Kpop acts, especially Exo). I'm sorry if my post gave that misleading impression to anyone, but just wanted to start a discussion where people can honestly bounce off ideas. I'm willing to be enlightened by new perspectives, which many of you have already shared.

Maybe I feel slightly more personal about this since I was a Korean citizen just until 6 months ago. And I've seen first-hand the tremendous favoritism that goes behind doors in Korean society, not just in Kpop, so I do acknowledge I feel a bit more sensitive about this than your average, sane ARMY.

Thanks for reading.

But I just got my driving license &amp; the first thing that popped into my mind was ""Strong power, thank you""  

This made me realize that over the last couple of months my brain associates or randomly remembers small snippets of BTS quotes &amp; lyrics. Like, whenever I'm on the verge of losing my composure I used to count backwards, now I repeat the chorus of ""2! 3!"" Many a times when I've felt demotivated, I remembered the legendary ""You &amp; I, we will win in the end. We will win so naturally making sure no one sees us coming"" (that fact that I 'hear' it in a rather deep Namjoon voice is erm...very effective)

While this's not very unusual for me- I've always recalled movie/novel/poem quotes in all sorts of daily situations, I was wondering if anyone else ever just associates a random Bangtan quote with a irl situation or just randomly remembers Bangtan moments on a daily basis. ~~I'm actually trying to confirm if I need to get myself checked~~ *Or maybe I'm just weird* ._.

Edit: I also have Ryuseralover's *Kazoo-dipity* playing in my head at times. If you haven't heard it, do check it out, it's not a track to miss ",164,96

Even now, all of them would come to him and tell him what argument they had and how they solved it, even the embarassingly trival arguments. 

- Bang PD said BTS prioritizes their team and their songs so they dont and have never argued about part distribution or center position ever. 

- Responding to a question about the meaning of Smeraldo, Bang PD said it holds various meanings and interpretations but its not the end yet, so we can try and find different meanings for it. He also said about Smeraldo: Only the smoke is ascending, the end hasnt come yet.

Hi all! 

You may have seen it in the news, but recently there was a story about a young girl who was sexually assaulted at her high school: https://twitter.com/BrianEntin/status/961769935616737280
https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-gardens-9th-grader-says-she-was-raped-by-3-boys-in-school-bathroom/

Many online quickly noticed that the victim was wearing an ARMY sweatshirt and really felt like it was one of our own family who had been affected. I messaged the reporter ([@BrianEntin](https://twitter.com/BrianEntin)) asking if there was anything we could do and he responded: 
&gt; Thanks for the note. We are receiving all the of the emails. I am going to print them out and bring them to the family this week. -Brian


The article shares that the victim is traumatized and the school suspended not only the assailants, but also her. So if you guys would like to send any words of comfort/love/support or donate to the family, please do so! I felt this was especially relevant because of BTS's messages to us of ""Love Yourself"" and their ""End Violence"" campaign with UNICEF. I hope the victim can know that we are all here as support and family for her in this difficult time. Even if we can make this process just a little bit less painful for her, it will be meaningful.

They're in blazers, long sleeves and thick jackets a lot. Sometimes even layered like when Suga, J-Hope and RM are wearing robe like jackets over their blazers and long sleeve shirt to perform BTS Cypher 4 during The Wings Concert Tour. That's 3 layers! All while dancing incredibly intense routines for multiple hours during their shows. It makes me wonder how they don't get heat stroke or dehydrated. I barely ever see them take their jackets off even when they look visibly heated and sweat is pouring down their faces. I know when i do my cardio workout I couldn't stand to have a jacket on, much less multiple layers. Have they ever mentioned anything about this?",31,88

Since thats pretty much the case, do you think thats why this album is the most K-pop-sounding? Im not sure if youd all agree, but I definitely think LY:H is an easier listen compared to the rest of the albums since it sounds very pop as compared to their usual EDM and hip-hop. That being said, since a lot of pop songs are, well, superficial, do you think they intended to change their genre a bit to match the concept? ",31,60

In America, it can be considered rude and disrespectful if you walk up to a celebrity and ask for a photo or something signed if they are busy or it is a bad time. By some standards, it is rude unconditionally. Other times, celebrities do not mind at all. Then at American meet and greets, you typically get to exchange a few words, get a hug, a picture or two, then you are ushered out to make way for the next fan. 

As far as Korean culture goes, I may be uneducated in this, so correct me if I am wrong. Hugging is the equivalent of kissing someone on the cheek in America. Koreans do not typically do it especially if they're not close, and doing it as a foreigner to a Korean would most likely make them uncomfortable. So I'd imagine fans hugging their idols is a cultural taboo (Although based on what I see at fansigns, other forms of skinship are fine and acceptable).

By my understanding, BTS members (and perhaps other kpop idols as a whole) are not permitted to take photos with fans, at least in public or on the streets. So I do not know if they do meet and greets at concerts for VIP or ever hug and take pictures with their fans.

But in the end, respecting BTS's privacy and wishes is number one priority. This is just me being curious of how these things work in Korea and how their culture differs from ours. ",23,59

(The article that [@BigHitEnt](https://twitter.com/BigHitEnt/status/962823516633444352) linked)

&amp;nbsp;

*[Translation]*

BTS (RM, Jin, Sugar, J-Hope, Jimin, V, Jungkook) broke their own record again by scoring 1.58 million copies of album sales.

According to Gaon Chart's latest album chart for January, 2018, 'LOVE YOURSELF: Her sold 92,891 copies in January, scoring cumulative sales of 1,588,384 copies since its release on September 18 of last year. This is the highest cumulative sales volume in Gaon charts history.

BTS 'LOVE YOURSELF: Her' sold over 1.2 M copies in September, the first to exceed the 1.2 M threshold after g.o.d in November, 2001 (4th album; 1,441,209 copies according to Korean Record Industry Association). They also set overseas Korean-best records with this album with #7 on Billboard 200 and #14 on UK official album chart. 

In addition, all 10 albums that BTS have released since their debut in June, 2013, entered the Top 50 of January album chart. The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (#16) and WINGS (#17) are still very much loved.

He's currently working on the next album [with Bang PD). They're apparently writing not only the rap parts but the lyrics as well and he's run into a bit of a dilemma and is therefore asking Armys to help, even though he knows we can't really help lol

He's worrying about the advantages and pitfalls of writing lyrics in two kinds of way: straightforward, simple and not complex; or worded/phrased beautifully and metaphorically.  He's aware that though writing straightforwardly is best and comes at you better at times, misused, it may sound childish. He's also aware that while pretty phrasing and metaphors may sound pretty, if misused even slightly, the light of what you were originally trying to express may darken or fade away.

Therefore, he would like to know which one we prefer, when we listen to music.

464,2018-2-14,2018,2,14,2,7xb7xd,To move on or not to move on? That is the question.,inquixotication,1518544610,"Hello, ARMY. This is my first time writing a post for reddit, so sorry in advance if its awkward or all over the place. Im still learning how reddit - and specifically this subreddit - works

Ive decided to post this in the hope of starting a dedicated and consolidated conversation about the Army fandom and its traumas. And since I'm an Army who was heavily affected by some events but am currently making an effort to heal, I wanted to hear other peoples experiences as well.

Its safe to say that 2015 - early 2017 were rough for BTS and Army as well. But from what Ive observed, BTS seems to have moved on while Army hasnt. I think another reddit user put it best (I cant find the exact comment right now, but when I do Ill link it): BTS is finally in a place where they can move on, and they have. They received the closure from their negative experiences and are finally in a better place. Army, however, hasnt received the closure from the traumas theyve endured since they are different from BTS' and are *still* dealing with many forms of drama, online harassment, gaslighting (thanks to one user who pointed that out) etc. from the same fandoms that have put them through those experiences. 

There is yet to be a safe space for Army to talk about these negative experiences in a productive manner, and there has been a minimal effort to create these spaces. When Army address the traumas, many shut them down and call it victimizing or trivialize the matter, or it is used to justify fanwars.

Moreover, Im active on twitter and recently noticed a rise of Army police accounts which go around and police other accounts and tweets in an attempt to save face for the fandom but I think it may be contributing to a further repression of emotions. On the bright side, [@BTS_AHC](https://twitter.com/BTS_AHC) is an account recently created to provide a safe space for Army and connect them with Army counselors and people who can lend a helping hand, and from what I can tell this is a step in the right direction. 

So my questions for discussion are (this sounds awkward lol): 

-How are these traumas exhibited in the Army fandom? 
-What are your own experiences pertaining to this topic? 
-How have these traumas and behaviors evolved over time? 
-And most importantly, can Army move on? If we can, what steps should be taken to achieve this?

Feel free to add on or bring up other points :)

Also, Im not particularly interested in hearing rants or bashings about Army, but I am interested in constructive criticism. Please keep this a safe space for Army to express themselves and their experiences, thank you. I really do believe it's time to at least start having this conversation

**Edit - Please Read**: I would like to make it clear that in ""moving on"" I don't mean it as forgetting and not talking about it. I mean it in being able to heal correctly from those experiences, sorry that I couldn't deliver it correctly. Also the Army I refer to in this post isn't *all* the fandom, I just used the umbrella term as a simpler means of referring to Armys that are still dealing with trauma. I'm really sorry for not making it clear :( and thank you for all the comments, it's a good place to start the conversation.

469,2018-2-14,2018,2,14,7,7xdfid,"RISE Bangtan: A personal mantra for dealing with fanwars, hate and harassment",Kelliente,1518562344,"[This post about dealing with past attacks on ARMY](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/7xb7xd/to_move_on_or_not_to_move_on_that_is_the_question/) spurred a discussion about dealing with them in general. Many accounts are spreading messages of positivity to help ARMY deal with hate in a positive way.

I've been toying for some time with the idea of a mantra to use when dealing with online harassment of ARMY or BTS. We all know you shouldn't engage in nasty online fights with other fandoms, but in practice it's really hard to resist replying because you feel like you need to defend BTS and our fandom.

Having a mantra for coping with stressful situations is pretty widely acknowledged as an effective coping technique; something simple to repeat to yourself that helps you feel in control and direct your emotions and actions in a positive direction.

-------------

The Mantra is **RISE** and it's a mnemonic for what to do when you encounter someone slandering ARMY or BTS, or otherwise talking smack or hate.

**REPORT. IGNORE. SUPPORT. ENCOURAGE.**


**Report** : If they violate terms of use for the platform (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) report their account.

**Ignore**: This is the hardest part. Ignore them. The way engagement on most social platforms works is, any post that gets a lot of responses, replies, retweets, etc (even negative ones) gets boosted. So engaging in any way actually helps amplify the message you're trying to drown out. Ignore them and move on. Don't respond and don't bandwagon, witchhunt, or dox. Don't worry, if every ARMY sticks to the RISE mantra, one person's hateful whisper will get drowned out by a thousand shouts of support.

**Support:** This is how you drown out the hate. Rather than responding to a hateful message with more hate, post messages of support for ARMY, BTS, BigHit, and more. Drown out the negativity with positivity in volume. Don't reply to the hateful comment making a long thread with a bunch of engagement that keeps it at the top of the comments. Post a bunch of positive messages and like/RT other ARMY's positive messages so that negative one gets ignored and pushed out of sight.

**Encourage:** Encourage other ARMY to follow the RISE mantra. Note it says *encourage*, not police. You can't control what someone else wants to say or do, only your own actions. We're here to help each other grow and learn, not try to punish one another for actions we disagree with. If many ARMY set a positive example and gently encourage others to do the same, then that has a much stronger, long-term, sea-change effect on our fandom than criticizing and trying to shut down individual accounts.

---------------------

In tandem with initiatives like ARMY is the Face of BTS, my hope is that if the fandom adopts a specific system for positive response to these kinds of online attacks, not only does it paint BTS and ARMY in a good light, but it allows individuals to ""fight back"" against slander or hate without directly engaging and thus fanning the flames of a fanwar or making us look petty. Also, success is the best revenge so it's better to put your energies towards something that benefits us rather than spending time and energy lashing out at haters.

I think adopting something like this could be a really positive thing for our fandom and even set an example for other fandoms, but it's very difficult to adopt in practice without widespread support. 

What do you think of something like this? Would it work? Is this mantra worth trying to spread? 

If you think it's worthwhile, what are some good ways to spread it?

Edit: Thanks to yall's suggestions, I changed the name of my primary fandom/voting account on Twitter and [pinned this thread at the top](https://twitter.com/RISEmantra). I also messaged a couple of big accounts. I'll try to whip up some pretty graphics tomorrow, but if anyone wants to make something shareable, that'd be awesome!",28,177

&amp;nbsp;

J-Hope: ""It's the year of golden dog, so I feel like there will be many meaningful things happening to me since I was born in the year of dog. I wish I can be always thankful for what is given to me this year. I want to let people listen to my mixtape that I'm currently working on soon.""

&amp;nbsp;

Jimin: ""I wish all the members and our fans are healthy and happy in 2018. I wish that I will be able to show myself more this year.""

&amp;nbsp;

V: ""I can't believe that I'm already 24 and that BTS have reached where we are now. In 2018, I wish the members and everyone around me don't get hurt inside and out and be healthy. I hope this year to be full of days where everyone can smile.""

&amp;nbsp;

Jungkook: ""In 2018, I want to be more persistent and develop myself further. I also want to practice the piano hard so that I can play better.""

I am getting married (tell Yoongi I couldn't keep the finger open, sorry) and would love to include a little bit of Bangtan in my wedding. 

I'm currently in final planning mode with a few months away and would love some creative help with how I can incorporate BTS. I'm happy to say my family are also ARMY as well (mom, 2 sisters, brother-in-law, 2 nieces, and my fiance!) So I think it would be fun for all of us.

 Here are a few ideas I have already:

Army Bombs as bridesmaid bouquets swapped out for pictures.
Play instrumental/piano versions of BTS songs before the ceremony
Perform 1 BTS dance (my nieces really want to do this)

I would LOVE your ideas and thoughts on this special occasion and would be happy to report back after the wedding to show how it went. Thank you so much!",67,138

515,2018-2-15,2018,2,15,15,7xomkq,What is a BTS performance you always re-watch/go back to? Are there any lesser known ones that you enjoy?,sugalearnsomerespect,1518676094,"Since BTS are currently having some well-deserved downtime, I decided to re-watch newer live performances and discover older ones. That had me wondering, ""what is everyone else's favorite performance, could it be one that I haven't seen before"" and I thought it'd be a good idea to make this thread since there are a lot of newer ARMY, too. I don't want to exclude the more popular performances like [Perfect Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMMx1hOwH-4), which if you haven't watched you should, but I'm hoping we could introduce lesser known ones, as well. I'd love it if you could share your favorite performance and a small description as to why. With that said, here are a few of my favorite:

1. Before I was a BTS fan, I *loved* rock music, so this cover of Seo Taiji's [Class Idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvjJwk1YrUI) is always on my mind ~~and I seriously need more Rockmon in my life~~

2. This is a really recent one but it's by far my favorite performance of [Not Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvU-usYA4jg), so far. The intro was unique and had new choreography that I absolutely loved. There was also a lot of smaller things that I really adored about it: Yoongi's adlibs, Jin's expressions, Tae's growls, Jimin's charisma, Namjoon's intensity, Hobi's amazing smile, and Jungkook's loud *Gyeonwo chong! jojun!* **balsa!**. 

3. Lastly, I am really weak for Hip-Hop Lover, and I love the version from the Epilogue concert because of Jimin's raspy voice, the rap-line feeling themselves, and Jin, Tae, &amp; Jungkook's beautiful vocals. Plus, it's just fun to see the guys strut around the stage and enjoy themselves. 

I can't wait to hear yours!

When I first started learning Korean to now at an intermediate stage, I think I started understanding certain members better as time went on.

First, I understood Tae the best because of the way he pauses between phrases. When he pauses, it gave me time to process what he said. 

Then after moving to Seoul, I started understanding Jin best. I think Jin has the most natural Seoul accent (obviously since he was born and raised in the city). So in being surrounded by Seoul dialect and mannerisms when I lived there, I think it was easier for me to pick up his body language cues and inflections more. And he also speaks very clearly.

RM sometimes has sort of an American lilt to his speech these days. Am I the only one that thinks that?? He tends to use higher language and Im not quite at the level where I easily pick up on sarcasm in Korean (which he uses a lot) so I rarely understand him. I also have a hard time understanding Hobi (he talks so fast and his satoori is always popping through randomly, so it throws me off.). 

And dont even get me started on my bias. Suga.... Its known that he talks like hes drunk, but really, I never understand a word he says  His words run together and when I go back and read Korean subtitles I always think THATS what he said?! I love him though. I could listen to him mumble all day. And he tends to also speak with higher language, like RM, so it goes over my head. 

I really like analyzing languages and speech patterns. Anyone else weird like me?

&gt;J-Hope: ""The truth is I still don't know how to de-stress. But lately, when I get stressed, I try to relieve it through music. Each thing we complete I feel a lot of joy."" (This prompts an ""Ohhhhhh"" from all the members.)

&gt;And we're back! RM used to print out the lyrics to Outsider, Epik High, and MC Sniper, memorize them, and rap in the shower.

&gt;Jin: I was in college at the time when the casting director saw me getting off a bus and ran after me. It was like fate. If it hadnt been for that, there would be no worldwide handsome. 
RM: Well, someone else would have taken your place.

I live in Chicago so as a major city, I have access to multiple Barnes and Noble stores and have called many. Ive included nearby suburbs as Im up on the north side. This is the current tally:

State St: may carry it at some point but not sure when its coming in.

Jackson St (DePaul store): Do not have it

Webster St: Do not have it

Evanston: Do not carry Billboard

Skokie (Village Crossing): Do not have it

Glenview (Old Orchard): the woman on the phone had no idea what I was talking about.

Orland Park: Do not sell Billboard

Oak Brook: Carries Billboard but does not have the newest issue.

Joliet: Do not carry Billboard

Schaumburg: Do not carry Billboard

Chicago-Main Newsstand (Evanston): They carry Billboard but have not gotten the issue yet

So far, zero for zero. I would have thought State St would carry it but it sounds like theyre not getting new issues in today. I have not called any Target stores though it sounds like Barnes and Noble is where youre more likely to find Billboard. However, if anyone calls any other stores, please put it here.

*UPDATE:* Quite a few of the stores I'm calling are saying they may get it but do not have it yet. I'm guessing Saturday is probably not a stocking day for most stores. My conclusion is that most stores do not stock on Saturdays and we may have better luck tackling them starting Monday. 


Help your fellow fans out if you can!

I have noticed a trend when it comes to BTS solo or otherwise vlives and some of the grievances brought up by Army afterwards towards potentially disrespectful remarks or comments made. Hopefully this post is well within the rules of this subreddit, and I definitely want it to remain so in the discussion, but I would like to know how you guys feel about the way people comment or how they should comment on live vlive content. Currently a hashtag has been created in hopes to reach K-Armys as well about the topic. I am mostly interested in how we as a group can potentially resolve this trend that has been occurring in many vlives. I was inspired mostly by the recent RISE approach created, so I thought it we be interesting to see what we can come up with.  

edit: Thank you everyone for your thoughts and opinions on this topic! A lot of you came up with really great ideas and pointed out important things that we should focus on as Army. I know with this sort of thing there is not a whole lot we can realistically do since we are such a huge fanbase. But I am glad that by talking about it we can reach more people, so that this type of thing can eventually become very minimal. There was one comment on twitter that really stood out to me and it was that BTS or any other group's fanbase should provide safe and productive interaction spaces for them to be themselves, without fear of judgement. The comment mentioned how Korean idols, especially with more news about the harsh idol reality, need to know that fans are support system and not a potentially negative side effect and it is our role as fans to create that safe environment for them as well as for us. I think BTS and Army have done extraordinarily well in this department because of the strong dedication we have towards BTS and them towards us. There is a reason the BTS/Army relationship has been viewed as such an anomaly by the public, and we should work to progress that :)",123,82

I just wanted to discuss something that popped in my mind. I stumbled upon a random YouTube video that was of BTS reacting to another group's performance. Watching it made me think about who they are when they are ""off"" and the camera's aren't there. Usually, when I think of someone being ""off"" it's as if I can see another layer of who they truly are.

I just really enjoyed watching them sit there at the table at an awards show, listening, observing, and talking amongst themselves. It added this extra dimension to them, of being down to earth and more human I guess! Of course they were having fun with some songs and dancing/singing along and stuff, but it was just really interesting to see them in another context and a more mellowed out persona. i just enjoyed observing them doing nothing i guess? most of the time i see them in an interview, or s Run ep, or performance, so it was nice seeing them in a different context.

Has anyone else thought of this before? Or does anyone have any examples? 

I hope this all made sense &amp; I articulated myself well! Also please let me know if this doesn't follow the rules!

Edit: i'd like to add an extra note. i hope that my question isn't being misinterpreted. i'm in no way trying to say they are fake on camera or that they are bad people off camera. this was just a speculative question and i thought it was fun/interesting to think about their multi-faceted personalities! like for example, i think a lot of people (at least on Twitter) seem to categorize each member as simply one thing. this question was also prompted by a tweet I saw (https://twitter.com/dailyunnie/status/965269171989721088) and that made me think more about the layers of their character and how they interact with each other, as well as the fact there's so much more behind the scenes that we may never know!",63,64

I know that there was a summary post for the Spotify Singapore posts, but this one really struck a chord with me and I wanted to see what others thought. I don't think I've seen anyone post on this specific topic. In that post, he says: ""Hey ARMY, my wish is for you to push yourself past your comfort zones this year. **Let's try something new...**Love, Suga."" 

As someone who does not like change, but does like to innovate, this was a really powerful set of words for me. It's encouraging because I see those words reflected back at him: how is he going to try something new? After all, he did say ""let's."" Then, I see those words in everyone. I am trying to take those words to heart, challenging myself. This year I am flying over water for the first time (conquering a huge fear of mine), trying to take new approaches into my teaching, taking on a new role, and attempting to try something new through kickboxing. (Admittedly, still thinking on that last one.) I have more I could list because I am serious about this.

You're going to try something new this year. We all try something new all the time, even speaking up more or lifting our eyes from the sidewalk or eating something new. I've seen so many wonderful threads about how BTS has encouraged people to change, in big and small ways. Taking this challenge/encouragement as it is, what new things will you try this year and how do you think it will help you to grow as a person? 

I hope I am doing this right. This is my first time actually creating a post, so I completely understand if it must be removed, Mods. Thank you for your hard work! ",54,71

(click to see picture of Jimin like the Teletubbies' sun baby. It says 'proud BTS Jimin sunbaenim'.)

&amp;nbsp;

*[Translation]*

Jimin of Bangtan Sonyeondan, a popular idol group, supported the cost of middle school uniforms and gave signed CDs for all graduating students as his elementary school closes down.

Located in Geumsa Gongdan area, Geumjeong-gu, Busan-si, Hyeodong Elementary School is closing down on the 20th after 36 years of history.

At the last graduation ceremony held at 9 AM on the 20th, 10 graduating students and 50 current students gathered and shared their feeling on the closing.

Jimin was in the 26th graduating class. Today, Jimin's father attended the last graduation ceremony to give all 60 students CDs signed by BTS and delivered the support fund for school uniform (winter and summer) to the graduating class.

Jimin's father said ""Jimin graduated from this school 10 years ago. Hearing that the school will not be here anymore makes me sad and teary."" 

Jimin has been supporting the cost of school uniforms for the graduating class since last year when the decision of closing was made. 

&amp;nbsp;

diminie note:

For those who didn't know yet, all three schools that Jimin graduated from are closing or already have closed down. (Source: http://www.insight.co.kr/news/139663) His old middle school has already closed in 2013, and the high school that he gradated from (with Taehyung) will have the last graduation ceremony next year. 

Although it is not common for one to see all his alma maters closing down, school closedowns are becoming inevitable in Korea. South Korea's fertility rate is extremely low with the current projected rate at below 1.2.  ",25,296

Personally, Id love it if there was a MV for 4 o' clock."" 

Id want the MV to have a similar feel to the film Amelie, with a dreamy vibe and golden tones.

V would be a working-class boy in a rural town, while RM is affluent and working in Seoul. It would be about the universal nature of loneliness, that affects people of all ages or socioeconomic status. ",66,57

Can it be called a mixtape when it is no longer truly free? Also, with this turn of events, will they sell Hobis mixtape too or only make it available on paid streaming services?

Can only rappers make mixtapes or can singers too?

My first Reddit post EVER is on the Bangtan thread (!!), please give me some grace as I try to figure this out :) 

I'm the cohost of a lifestyle podcast that explores random topics that are a part of the ""millennial generation"". I would love to talk with a fan on my next episode about BTS' emergence into the US, K-Pop, and what it means to love BTS. 

It would be a quick 30 minute convo and an awesome chance to give BTS a shout-out! I'm looking for a fan who knows about BTS and can speak to the subculture within K-Pop (IE: who comes up with these awesome fan chants??). It'll be a super laid back, no pressure gig.

J-Hope's bucket list is to release his mixtape (before he dies), maybe yours is to guest star on a podcast? Thanks!!

&amp;nbsp; 

Invited as performers to the American Music Awards, the first in Korea to win Top Social Artist at the Billboard Music Awards, the fastest MV to hit 200 million views  
&amp;nbsp;  

What is the secret to success for BTS, a group who is writing history?  
&amp;nbsp;  

On the episode of KBS 1TV Good Insight Season 2 airing on the 23rd, it will be a time to listen to the head of BTSs agency, Big Hit Entertainment, producer Bang Sihyuk, speak on the secret to BTSs success and the future of K-Pop.  
&amp;nbsp;

Last November, the 2017 American Music Awards (AMAs) were held in LA. At this award ceremony, considered to be one of 3 major music award ceremonies in the US, a Korean song sounded out. Here, boy group BTS, 5 years after debut, were shoulder to shoulder with top world musicians, like Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez, Niall Horan, among others.  
&amp;nbsp;

It was a miracle no one could have imagined; that day, BTS ranked no. 1 in the Google search rankings in the US, going beyond America and leaving an imprint worldwide. What could be the reason that these 7 young Korean men have grabbed hold of the whole world?  
&amp;nbsp;

Starting with the passionate cheers of their American fans at LAX (LA airport) to the international media interviews and broadcasts scheduled back to back to their rehearsals for their American Music Award performance, without time to spare, coverage, not shown anywhere else, of BTSs schedules during their historical visit to the US, will be exclusively revealed on Good Insight.  
&amp;nbsp;

Echo Bar Studios in LA, visited by the Good Insight news team; a place where Worldwide stars like Ne-Yo and Usher recorded albums and also where BTSs 1st full album was born. What image of early BTS does studio head, Eric Reichers, who assisted during their album recording, remember?  
&amp;nbsp;

If it wasnt the best, they werent satisfied. They worked hard until they thought its perfect. Believing that, with sincerity and patience, success will follow, they had invested time and effort, said Eric Reichers.  
&amp;nbsp;

World stars BTS, that the whole world acknowledges however, only 5 years ago, they were just seven ordinary young boys. Overflowing with talent and dreams, they faced the frustrations of reality head on to come into their own and fans around the world strongly indentified with them.  
&amp;nbsp;

Called self-learning-type idols, BTS members confessed their personal dreams and goals in front of the Good Insight cameras. Their honest interviews will be revealed.  
&amp;nbsp;

According to Suga, I think the fact that we tell our own stories with our own voices is the first reason that our fans develop a sense of empathy with us. Jungkook revealed, Our ultimate goal is to, someday, complete an album full of songs self-written and self-produced [by all of us] with our own hands.  
&amp;nbsp;

Charming visuals, shocking stage performances, music videos perfected to a high degree, music that reflects global trends; how can BTSs music, that insists on Korean lyrics, transcend language and become popular worldwide? Charms revealed by the BTS team, composer/producer Pdogg, music video/art director Lumpens, knife-like choreography performance director Son Seungduk, will also be introduced.  
&amp;nbsp;

Good Insight Season 2 will air on the 23rd at 9:40pm.",17,92

852,2018-2-25,2018,2,25,2,7zy69y,An analysis of the solos in the Wings album (prompted by late-night karaoke in the car),cheerstobane,1519494517,"&gt;*""The harder a temptation is to resist, the more you think about it and vacillate. That uncertainty is part of the process of growing. ""Blood Sweat &amp; Tears"" is a song that shows how one thinks, chooses, and grows.""* -RM

Following the consensus that there is more to this album than the portrayal of the Damien story, I regard Blood Sweat and Tears as the transition from the Damien atmosphere to the inner layer of this album - i.e. separate stories told by each individual members that will eventually shape BTS as a whole. The title Blood Sweat and Tears is self-explanatory in terms of both the Demain story and the BTS self-declaration, but the lyrics of the song in general mostly relate back to the Demain concept of the album. Ill start the analysis of the solos below.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Stage 1: The Beginning**

- Begin (Jungkook)

&gt; *I was scentless and completely empty.*

A song sung by the youngest member of the group, Begin tells the story of a fourteen-year-old boy who determinately pursued his dreams of being a singer after he was enchanted by the magic of stage performance. In a way, Jungkook is, indeed, the most suitable member to start the story by beginning of everything, as unlike other members who are met with uncertainty and various temptations - e.g.love, friends, normality - that acts as forms of distraction during their journey, this singing dream is precisely what Jungkooks temptations are made of  a fascination that managed to captivate and gradually consume a boys innocence, prompting him to chase the magic mindlessly and give up his normal life.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Stage 2: The Pursuit**

- Lie (Jimin)

&gt; *I cant be free from this lie*

&gt; *Give me back my smile*

Turns out, trying to chase a dream is nothing like what the surface has promised. Happiness, content, the thrill and glory of a performer giving his all for the stage  all these empty assurances were instantly replaced by insecurity, dilemmas, doubt, and self-hatred instead. It was as if the boy has made a deal with a devil, losing everything he had the moment the contract was signed, and made to suffer indefinitely while being taunted by false hope. Played by the devil, caught in a lie.

&amp;nbsp;

- Stigma (V)

&gt; *Deeper, deeper, the wound just gets deeper*

&gt; *Like pieces of broken glass that I cant reverse*

Did I mention that I really love the titles of these tracks? Short and simple, yet conveying enough. People often argue the meaning of Stigma, trying to figure out which hidden side of Kim Taehyung is V exhibiting through the pain of his lyrics. Nevertheless, I prefer to analysis the song by looking at how the song itself adds to the whole story of Wings. Being placed after Lie and before First Love, the song tells the story of another similar soul who is struggling in the midst of the pursuit. 

Ive always wondered, why the name Stigma? I believe this name is the key to understanding the story. Pursing the idol life is naturally not seen as a realistic dream; it basically asks for everything a youth can give, in exchange for nothing but an empty promise of fame. Even then, it still wants more - someone has to support the youth both financially and emotionally. Someone close to the boy will have to suffer along the journey too. Perhaps something like, Why are you letting your son pursing an unrealistic dream instead of focusing on college? Isnt this what Stigma embodies? A disgrace to the people around, an odd stain in the functioning society.

&amp;nbsp;

- First Love (Suga)

&gt; *""I remember the end of my teens, you burned it all together with me*

&gt; *It was a time when I couldnt see an inch before me*

&gt; *I cried and laughed, because I was together with you""*

A different boy, torn apart by different forces of temptations. Who are we to say that the beauty of music is the evil-doing of the devil, a decoy masked under layers of seduction? Ultimately, doesnt everything in the world exist in different form of temptations? Everythings going to be alright if you go to university and do as we tell you. Another empty promise, yet one that is blindly followed by the society. If they are all empty promises in the end, is it not better to burn yourself for the first and utmost temptation, that is, love and passion itself? A first love so raw and primitive, as innocent as the boy once was during in his untainted days. A suffering that is both orgasmic in its own, because what is love without the sadness to contrast?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Stage 3: The Reflection from Dream to Reality**

- Reflection (RM)

&gt; *I want to be free from freedom*

&gt; *Because right now Im happy but Im unhappy*

What they dont tell you is that there is no ultimate end goal to life. You won the lottery system, and out of a one in a million chance, you managed to win the grand prize. But the devil, or angel, whatever deity that granted you your wishes  they didnt mention that it wouldnt be like all the happily ever afters in fairytales that seem to freeze the happiest moment perpetually. Life doesnt stop. Like a human, you will still long for other temptations. Friends. Love. More Freedom. After everything the boy has been through, he learns to accept the hard reality that there will always be something missing in life, and tries his best to live with that hole in his heart. I wish I could love myself.

&amp;nbsp;

- MAMA (J-Hope)
	
&gt; *""What is higher than anything above the ground*

&gt; *What is wider than anything beneath the sky*

&gt; *You gave to me unconditionally, you were my support""*

Ah, J-Hope. Apparent in every variety show ever, J-Hope is always that spontaneous ball of energy with unpredictable outbursts of hope and optimism. That is exactly how his solo feels like in this album: a sprinkle of hope shining brightly in midst of melancholic memories. People have different ways of self-reflection, and while RM and Jins reflections represent a slightly more pessimistic side of self-judgement, J-Hopes reflection instead comprises of a long detailed flashback of his path to success, tracing back to every figure that has supported the boy unconditionally. As explained in Stigma, a pursuit of temptation does not merely affect one individually alone, but also the people who are closely associated with the individual. Except in this case, the boy has won; he is no longer a stigma, but a pride.

&amp;nbsp;

- Awake (Jin)

&gt; *""Maybe I, I can never fly*

&gt; *Like the flower petals over there""*

&gt; *I cant become like those with wings*

&gt; *Still, I want to reach out more*

Why do people reflect? Reflection is a process of examining and interpreting experience to gain new understanding. In other words, it is an act of stopping and evaluating your own position after having finished the tiring and consuming journey to your goal. Yeah, its been fun, chasing and breaking records one after the other. Its been fun to indulge in fulfillment and pride, to soar higher and higher towards the clouds. However, its time to wake up. Jin isnt the best singer in BTS, Jungkook is. But Jungkook is definitely not the best singer outside BTS. J-Hope is not the best dancer in Korea. Suga and RM arent the best rappers in history. BTS may be one of the most successful k-pop groups now, but they are not, and will never be, the best music group. There is always a limit to what we can achieve, and deep down, everyone is aware of this fact. However, like the chase of temptation itself, humans always desire something they do not possess, and thus it is in their nature that they will attempt over and over again to touch the sky despite knowing full well that they do not have wings. But isnt this, in a way, the cycle of hope and unknown fate? Isnt this how life is, eventually?

So, rap line are my three biases and I love them all dearly, and am counting down the days til Hixtape is released. As for Yoongi's mixtape, it's one of the things that really made me fall in love with him and BTS, for so many reasons I won't get into for the sake of brevity. But while these things get a lot of discussion I want to talk about Namjoon's mixtape for the following reasons: A) I only recently listened to it in its entirety rather than just the tracks with music videos (I am a baby Army- since late August which is why I'm so late for getting into it, I had a lot of content to consume, sue me) and I am currently riding on a Namjoon high lmao. B) It hasn't really been posted about recently as far as I know? and I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts on it because I haven't actually spoken to many people about it or read many in-depth discussions about it (makes sense because it was released years ago but still!)

So, what are your fave tracks? What about the mixtape speaks to you? What are your fave lyrics etc, and do you have expectations/hopes for his next mixtape release? 

Just to clarify this isn't to take any attention away from Hixtape, I'm just truly really into this specific mixtape at the moment and have been thinking a lot about Namjoon's lyricism and want to talk about it with people. You can bet when Hixtape drops I'll be ranting about that as well, lmao.

&amp;nbsp;

Every day we hear news from Pyeongchang that make us proud of being Korean. BTS, along with this, once again splendidly dominated Billboard, showing the class of our pop music. On the 15th, Billboard, an American pop chart and a music magazine, revealed their magazine with BTS on its cover. The magazine not only presented the whole group on the cover but also published seven extra versions featuring each of the seven members, making a total of eight versions. It is the first time since their initial issue in November of 1894 that Billboard features individual members of a group in separate covers. They also created a separate section for BTS on their official website where they gathered news on BTS. This makes us realize the status of BTS. 

&amp;nbsp;

BTS, surely it will be sold out.

BTS are not the first Korean act to be featured on the cover of Billboard. JYJ and Psy got featured in 2010 and 2013, respectively. However, it is the first time that 8 versions (7 individual covers and 1 group cover) are published.

Choosing which celebrity to be featured on the cover is called gambling at the editorial department because no one is confident on whether the sales volume would increase regardless how famous the celebrity is. When a magazine decides to have one artist to create 8 versions, its not an issue of increasing the sales volume, it means that they were absolutely confident that everything would be sold out. This is the most extreme commercial judgment that can be made in the magazine publishing industry, and is also the assessment of American pop culture on the artist, BTS. 

In addition, this strategy also proves popularity and brand awareness of BTS in the US. Cover model selection is determined largely based on three factors: popularity, news-making ability, and favorable impression. BTS proved their news-making ability while appearing at BBMAs, AMAs, and TV shows. They made a good impression not only with their performances but with their acceptance speech, TV appearances, and interviews, getting positive feedback. Billboards publishing 8 version of BTS-covers is a proof that they are no longer recognized as a 7-member Korean boygroup but are enjoying a reputation high enough that people can distinguish each member without difficulty. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, look at BTS!

It is noteworthy that Billboard created a separate category for BTS on their official website. In all kinds of media, including traditional magazines, newspapers, broadcasts and online magazines, the most important thing is not the article itself. It is editing. This is why the person who makes the most important final decision is called editor. An editor decides the most important topic of the issue and places the topic at the most visible place. This is so-called agenda setting.

According to media theory, agenda setting does not show how general publics perception is reflected on the media. Media sets the topic and changes the perception of general public. The fact that BTS has their own category on Billboards webpage is not a simple reflection of current popularity of BTS. It shows how Billboard, the most authoritative American pop music media, decided that BTS should get the spotlight. Billboard is talking about an even bigger growth potential of BTS, not their current popularity. They are telling the American general public to listen to BTS music, right now.

&amp;nbsp;

BTS are Korean musicians.

The reason why BTS success makes me proud as a Korean comes from their attitudes at public appearances and interviews. It is a very natural decision of them to choose the background of the Billboard covers to be *Hanok* (Korean traditional house) and to talk about Korean food such as *samgyeopsal*.

They are not intentionally promoting Korea. Just as they naturally show their gratitude for their fandom, ARMY, they naturally show their roots and identity. BTS do not forget the fact that they are Korean boyband. This obvious fact becomes a pride of Korean general public. When BTS say We are Korean singers. So we make and perform music in Korean, they dont necessarily have to mention or add patriotism.

It is always a good news when Korean pop culture such as Hallyu or K-Pop is loved by people around the world. The fact that our passion and talents can impress people all over the world gives us a greater feeling of achievement and pride than the level of per capita GDP or new scientific/technological advances. It is a pride at the conscious/emotional level, not at the material level.

Seeing the athletes at Pyeongchang, we are thrilled and touched by their efforts and passion, not by their physical fitness, strength, or techniques. The same applies to the worlds evaluation and attention on BTS and their music. It is their passion and potentials that become the pride of us. And all their moves are the nations (and our pop music's) class presented to the world.",23,148

The thing is, swan neck deformity is a PERMANENT deformity [with hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal \(PIP\) joint and flexion of the distal interphalageal joint \(DIP\) joint](http://handtherapy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SwanNeckDefomity.jpg) - basically the finger is bent straight at the middle finger joint and bent at the joint at the end. This is usually a manifestaion of rheumatoid arthritis and less commonly Ehler's Danlos syndrome.  

Basically Jin does NOT have Swan Neck Deformity as his fingers only appear like that only when he has them in extension (straightened out). You can't diagnose him with a medical condition based on solely ONE physical examination finding which wasn't identified correctly in the first place. Basically Jin's fingers have the same ""condition"" [as mine](https://imgur.com/a/Kri89) - joint hypermobility or ""double jointedness"". Although this can present in those who have Ehler's Danlos, the presence of finger hypermobility alone does not make a diagnosis for Ehler's Danlos. Personally, apart from people commenting on how strange my fingers can occasionally look ~~or when they get stuck when I'm trying to play piano~~, they don't really have an impact on how I live my day to day life. That being said, it's still not nice to have people making rude comments about hypermobile fingers. KIM SEOKJIN, WE BOTH HAVE BEAUTIFUL FINGERS.

Sorry for the long rant, but I felt the need to make a post for a few reasons - firstly, I did not want fans to worry needlessly about Jin having a medical condition and secondly it's very frustrating to see medical misinformation spreading in the community.

My question to you all is how much do you rely on BTS for your personal happiness?


I've followed since 2015. I've come to really rely on them. Depression, anxiety, ED, I've used their music and messages to help me through it all. I'm aware I'm projecting a lot onto a music group I like that does not know me but I truly feel like BTS is what changed me from being terrified of tomorrow to me anticipating a new day. I've seen people on forums mention that BTS helped them with addiction, weightloss, divorce.


I felt lonely and like I couldn't depend on a single person, so when people would target my BTS obsession I would feel really mad because BTS brought me happiness when nothing else was. I felt like I had friends rooting for me that I could keep up with and feel a part of (even though I know that's not really true). Honestly without BTS I know I would be leagues worse off than I ended up. I don't think another band or singer could have replaced what they became for me, or that my happiness could be so dependent on anyone else besides them. When I want to do shitty things I think of them and opt for the right choice, every time.


I know it's not healthy but it's true. So I ask you all, how much does BTS mean to you and your happiness or growth?",45,104

890,2018-2-26,2018,2,26,5,8077dz,Discussion: Japanese Promotion vs. U.S. Promotion,outrofi,1519590607,"Im going off of this by a bit of a whim but let me see if I can explain it well. I was just catching up on Jimin and Hoseoks mini promo tour in Japan and have always kind of noticed how their promotion in Japan always goes over pretty smoothly. Again, there could be a lot of factors like being comfortable with Japanese culture. Also, the fact that them promoting in Japan is very regular so theyve gotten a good system in place, and also could be comfortable with the language. (And a slight side note: In accordance to the language, there seems to be a bit of mixed reactions because some people say there are fluent speaking members, but there are also people that say that their Japanese is mediocre. I watched a recent interview  [here ](https://youtu.be/OgJAXHGymRE) and it seemed like Jimin and Hoseok were almost fluent-ish. But I also noticed the ear pieces and I wasnt sure if they were getting support or not. There are also other interviews where it seems like they need help from a translator like [here ](https://youtu.be/BgFrqwajeLI) .) Anyways, either way, through these factors I always seem to feel that Japanese interviews go over much more smoothly nonetheless whether they have a translator there or not. It seems the system they have in place is much more helpful and I wonder why English interviews dont go as smoothly (still not eliminating the above factors I mentioned that could key into the possibility of why) but I do believe their U.S. team could do a better job to make U.S. promotion to go a tad bit smoother. I think the same factors could apply like having someone to translate on the scene with them etc. yet there always seems to be something slightly janky about the way U.S. interviews go. I also find that the translators they use arent always on top of it like it seems like Japanese translators are. Also, there are a lot of situations where they dont even use translators. When they dont use translators I find  1.) all of the pressure is on Namjoon and he seems visibly stressed in those situations 2.) Its difficult for them to convey ideas that are prompted by the interviewers 3.) Their personalities are lost in translation, which I find is absolutely key to even having the interviews. Anyways, I dont want to make this too long but what do you guys think? I would also love to hear anyone who can kind of elaborate on their Japanese language level.. I hope I made this fairly clear! Basically I just wanted to have a discussion contrasting their foreign promotions and use Japan as a reference point. ",55,48
891,2018-2-26,2018,2,26,5,807blp,How BTS was viewed in 2013-2014?,SheepishSleepySheep,1519591590,"As a relatively new army, this is a question Ive always wanted to ask some of the older fans of BTS. 

I know a lot of when BTS started becoming popular and the drama surrounding them in recent years from other posts, but I dont hear very often of what it was like like when they first debuted, and like a child who is curious about the old days I thought Id ask lol. 

When BTS first came on to the scene, what in general was the consensus people came to about them? What led you to stanning them?

How did people view them? Was there any hype at all surrounding them? How did YOU view them? Did you ever think or hope they would make it this big? 

What are some fond memories you have of that time early in their career? What about memories that arent so pleasant? 

How does it feel seeing them so successful now with so many new fans joining?

Im  not looking for all these questions to be answered lol these are just some things I was wondering about. I always love hearing from older fans about the experiences they have had with BTS, especially when they are experiences as a new fan Ive never encountered. :)

(P.S. Im not sure whether to flair this as a question or a discussion so I went with discussion. If that was the wrong flair to use please let me know)",42,63

The more I think about it, I think it would be amazing for BTS to perform at the Ball. European ARMYs would finally get BTS in Europe and BTS would get a huge amount of public attention. It takes place in Wembley Stadium, which can accomodate [80,000 people](http://www.capitalfm.com/events/summertime-ball/photos/2015-in-numbers/crowd-attendance/) and hundreds of thousands more who watch it online. 

I think BTS could definitely work that huge stage and put on a massive, amazing show.

&amp;nbsp;

J-Hope has announced the release of his mixtape and is preparing to reveal his own music. He is the third one to release a mixtape from BTS, following RM and Suga (Agust D). BTS introduce individual members' musical charm and characteristics one by one through a form of mixtape. The public has already experienced the wit of RM and the wild side of Suga. An increasing attention is focused on how J-Hope, the third runner, will show himself as a musician.

&amp;nbsp;

*Mixtape, an old future of music*

Mixtape might sound unfamiliar to those born after the 90's. Mixtape is a kind of musical cultural heritage created by a generation of cassette tape, a music storage medium that popped up and disappeared. The history of mixtape itself is short, but the meaning of the concept is quite important in the history of music. This is because the appearance of mixtape was a starting point where more musicians (or aspiring musicians) became able to to create, record, duplicate, and distribute their own music. There are countless examples where musicians got recognized for their potential along the mixtape trend and reached the top of the pop scene. For hip hop musicians, especially, mixtape shortly became an essential element of the genre as they could create music simply with beats and rap. 

The physical form of mixtape has disappeared as casette tape has made its way to museum. However, musicians creating mixtapes are still making music, and mixtape has revived online by being digitized. Current mixtape culture has settled itself on a new platform, SoundCloud. There is no more casette tape, but mixtapes are still constantly created. Mixtape, which was born out of a new musical vision of 'making, recording, and sharing one's own music with everyone', is an old future of the pop music.

&amp;nbsp;

*BTS, the trust in mixtape*

It is not a coincidence that J-Hope, RM, and Suga found the old future called mixtape. The members of BTS did not start their music as typical idol trainees that are harshly trained and elaborately planned. Before becoming BTS, they were young hip hop musicians dreaming of making their own music. It is natural that they want to make mixtape, an essential part of the genre.

RM and Suga showcased something that is of a completely different style from BTS' music. It was different from a solo album of a stereotypical idol, and they were outspoken. This is what makes people to look forward to J-Hope's mixtape. This is a faith that J-Hope will follow the two members who revealed their identity vividly by not being restricted by any frame and by expanding the horizon of their musical expression. This is an anticipation coming from the confidence that J-Hope will show something as J-Hope, something that is different from that from RM or Suga, just as BTS have done so far.

&amp;nbsp;

*The authenticity of J-Hope as a musician*

J-Hope's mixtape will be the first step in his musical career as an artist. J-Hope is known for his bright and energetic personality and as an extremely talented performer. It is of a great interest whether his mixtape will go along with his known identity or will reveal a completely different side of his that the general public did not know about. Of course the conclusion of this question and any assessment of his musical accomplishment can be made only after the music is released.

One thing that is certain at this point is BTS' attitude towards music. Their strategy is purely comprised of their desire to share their music with people. This gives authenticity to their words ""We don't need anything else than our fans who love our music."" It is the innocence of musicians that ""want to create their own music and share with everyone.""  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I reflect on the definition of 'Musician of the Year' again as I choose BTS as 'Musician of the Year'. Their listing their name on a famous foreign music chart, appearing at a well-known foreign award show, and selling millions of copies of album are all secondary factors. Idol, K-Pop, and overseas expansion also fail to fully describe them. 

A group that was born inside Korean pop music has captivated the heart of youth not only in Korea but also all over the world with the music made of themselves and by themselves and with their view of world. Their album was outstanding, and their move will cause various impacts on Korean music scene for the next few years. 

One cannot talk about year 2017 and BTS separately.
