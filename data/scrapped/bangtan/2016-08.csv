Im choosing to share it here because this is my BTS home and Im eternally grateful for the people here and the break this sub has given me from those days where things just felt too hard to keep going. Ive written about my health issues and my subsequent intro to kpop [here on the 4th comment down](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/4jv09r/bts_%EB%B6%88%ED%83%80%EC%98%A4%EB%A5%B4%EB%84%A4_fire_mv_reaction_massive_argentinian/) so Ill leave that for you to view if youd like the deets.    
    
So  just how did I end up in shackles in the back of an ambulance on my way to Nightmareville six weeks ago?    
    
Intense sleep deprivation plus the inability to manage pain levels from my surgeries (plus my doop doop MD lowering my pain meds during this time) and from my life coming to what felt like a dead end.  I hadnt slept more than 2-3 hours at a time for about 3 years due to my heart issues, then the pain/issues from the surgery and messed up blood just ended up being too much.    
    
Guys  I just wanted off the ride.  There was nothing that I could see that gave me any reason to stick around and I felt I was done.  My kids were grown and gone, Ive been single forever, I look like Gilbert Grapes mom (at least with better hair) and even the simplest tasks have become  impossible.    

*(cutting/suicide triggers ahead sweethearts, skip to the last 3 paragraphs if you need to)*
    
The less sleep I got, the more upset I got - the more gnarly panic attacks I had which made everything worse.  Finally, I slashed myself up on my stomach.  For me it seemed reasonable at the time because I was ready to be gone for good.  The cutting was my attempt to give it one last shot (after 10 years of not doing it).  Although it worked, I **way** overdid it and my skin was coming off in little ribbons.  The fact that I take blood-thinners meant it was a total mess and my sweet roommate had to help clean it up.  I was still so disconnected from myself I just saw her face turn grey but I didnt think much else of it.    
    
Because she is amazing, she got my cardiologist to pull strings and the next thing I knew I was at Kaiser a few days later answering questions about how I felt and if I had planned out my suicide.  Somewhere in my head, I knew this whole scene wasnt good (and Im not a liar by nature) so I told the whole ugly truth -- and about an hour later my fat ass was in the back of an ambulance on the way to my newest adventure.    
    
What can I say about the next 5 days of my life?  This is where it gets hard for me to explain.  Ive got some trauma there, I know.  Basically the staff at the place I was sent to decided to treat my psych needs only.  I got sleeping meds and Prozac (beautiful stuff) but they refused my pain medications and the anti inflammatory meds that unlock my joints so I can walk.  They denied all of it.    
    
This meant I couldnt walk anywhere and I couldnt do anything but cry.  In the morning I would drag myself down to the day room with the scary bullies who forced everyone to watch what they wanted (sports, sports and more sports).  Because I was stuck there, I pushed myself to run BTS songs through my head over and over and over.  It was the only thing I could do that was of any comfort.  There was no music allowed, the tv was blasting and people were screaming, throwing things, fighting with staff, etc ALL THE TIME and in virtually every room.    
    
(Note: Going into more detail has started making me upset.  Although I now have a deep wound on my leg from their neglect [nsfw but fine if you like gross stuff](http://imgur.com/a/z1gLi).  Most importantly to me, I can now appreciate how much strength I have AND I've made a lifelong friend who I call ""Single Serving Ben"" and we check up on each other constantly so I'll stop there.)    
    
Regular scary things aside, why was it so hard you ask? Although there was a schedule for me to get my pain meds, they messed around with it regularly.  If I complained (really I just cried) theyd drag it out longer.  So ultimately I decided to challenge my brain to be patient and my body to be quiet and restful.  This was all because I remembered [this clip](https://youtu.be/6HReEjtQuq4?t=11m40s) of Jungkook talking about how his thighs hurt but he kept going with that sweet way of his.  Suga and even Rap Monster talking about how exhausted they were on that video as well  but they all kept going, rehearsing and rehearsing and rehearsing to get it perfect.    
    
I knew I couldnt do anything about my physical issues, but I wanted to train my brain like they were.  After a long day of mayhem, it was hard to think straight with all of the noise but I grabbed a rubber pencil (yes, they were virtually impossible to write with) and [I started writing out all of the kpop bands I could think of](http://i.imgur.com/VT3GbuK.jpg?1).  My heart grew lighter as I remembered all bands that I had come to know and love because I fell in love with BTS.  It helped and before I knew it, it was bedtime.    
    
The next day was harder, they were supposed to let me go home that day but used a technicality to make me stay another day.  I was really, really angry and knew I was in danger of getting myself stuck there even longer (at this point they were threatening a 13 day hold).  So I went back to BTS.  I used the list Id made the day before and [I started writing out](http://imgur.com/vVW2Lc6) the bands, members and songs from the list I had written out the night before. While I did it, Id play the songs in my head like a record player.    
    
Im crying while I write this because it is difficult to explain how much this helped.  How much time it killed, how important it was for me to feel like I wasnt completely insane and mostly, how great it was to just sit and remind myself of all of the things Id watched and loved so much (and usually find out about in this sub).  How [silly Princess Jin is](https://youtu.be/eoz5_BP5mFs), how [kind Jimin is](https://youtu.be/VuZm-JNLcc0), [Grandpa Suga running](https://youtu.be/7_fe7ZYRkqc), [Taehyung teasing fans](https://youtu.be/hfdX6SqqHCg), [nervous smol bean Jungkook](https://youtu.be/C8LlUYM32RA), [J-Hope in the elevator prank](https://youtu.be/AEyanI5Z9Cc) and [Rap Monster missing his babies](https://youtu.be/d4bCr2EFXN0).  As I sat there, trying my best to not plug in to how loud it was, how much I hurt and how scared I felt... I would think about these different things and smile - really smile.  It helped so much.    
    
The last night there, they held my medication on purpose.  They told me to go to bed and theyd wake me up in an hour to give it to me.  I knew they wouldnt (learned experience) and I knew I wouldnt be able to walk out of the building the next day if I didnt have it before bed.    
    
So I sat down and [I wrote out](http://i.imgur.com/zoScQTi.jpg?1) every video I could think of and what the theme was or what was significant about it.  The entire time I did this, I was playing Save Me on repeat in my head and catching the tears as they dropped off my face.  Lights off was at 10pm so everyone else was gone and it was obvious the staff thought I would give up. I could tell they were shocked that I waited up until 11:15  that I sat quietly in the break room (they even closed up the day room so I couldnt sit in a comfortable chair).  I didnt care what they did and I reminded myself this was just their petty attempts at making more money off of my troubles.  I knew I was going to get out of there and I knew that my sweet boys from BTS would help.    So I made it to 11:15, naturally they dragged it out another 4 minutes but I took my meds and went to bed, knowing they had to let me go home because I made it through without flipping out.  Silly, they just didn't know I had [my secret weapon](https://youtu.be/GZjt_sA2eso).        
        
Things have since settled down in the last 6 weeks.  Im still sick from the heart and blood stuff, but I sleep through the night now and it makes a huge difference.  All the while, I have kpop running pretty much 24/7 in the background of my life.  It's what keeps me from feeling lonely, what makes me laugh, sing at the top of my lungs and even try harder to be better.    
    
So, this is quite a massive post - why did I write all of this out?  Well for you of course honey.  Maybe you are reading this and can relate because youre also having a hard time.  Perhaps you know someone who is hurting and you dont know what to do, I certainly understand.  Mostly I want my ARMY family to know my story and to know I adore you all and I'm here if you need someone to listen to you.    
    
Things can be so hard sometimes.  Life goes in weird directions, people leave, jobs suck  whatever it is, I know it can be miserable.  Maybe you could try some of the tricks Ive learned  or just send me a pm if you need someone to love on you.  Im right here.

*EDIT 8/4:  I am so overwhelmed by your beautiful responses. I'm at work now but I promise to respond to every single one of you as soon as I can.  Thank you so much for your encouragement, advice and love.  I actually went to bed last night promising myself I would leave this up even if it got zero attention or feedback just in case it helped one person.  It is obvious I owe you all an apology for so greatly underestimating the generosity of my ARMY family.*    
**EDIT 8/6:  I'm slowly responding to everyone.  Because I'm part computer, I printed out the list of everyones replies with oldest first and I'm writing a little letter in reply.  Basically I'm pretending I've pulled out the super sweet ""correspondence kit"" I had back in the 70's when I would write letters to my beloved Grandma Lee.  SO - if you haven't gotten a reply from me yet, I promise you will, it's just taking a little time because I want to make sure I give you the personal attention you gave me.  xoxoxo""**",37,66,False,self,,,,,

I was thinking about it and I think a number of people are still hoping for a comeback the end of this year. 

I doubt there will be one, and I say its a good thing. With the Japanese Album coming out and Yoongi's mixtape, I feel a comeback just wouldnt fit, it wouldnt be as hyped, and it would be so messy releasing so much stuff in a go

I think maybe next comeback would be next year perhaps around the same time when Fire was released

As for concept, I have no idea! Like we've been with HYYH for a while now, I have no idea what to expect from the next comeback, what do you guys think? 

I know a lot of people want romance concept but a lot of groups have done that one (so did BTS, boy in luv counts right?) I actually want to see something completely new! But I knida doubt it, making original concepts isnt exactly easy peasy.

I also wouldnt mind another concept like Dope or Fire I guess, I know they just did one but I love styling and stuff for MVs like that, the songs are energetic and the choreo is great so its really fun to watch

And kind of unrelated, but since we are talking about the future, what do you hope for them in terms of success, a lot of people say they are almost at their peak but I simply refuse to acknowledge that, cause I want to see them rise more and more!

mamuridweni seonyoor wiesseou

na horro beotigo isseo

(Sorry, I'm not very good at changing hangul to romanized).


Which I have seen always translated as:

On top of this ending melody

I am standing here alone


Roughly translated by my slight knowledge of Korean, it's more accurately:

At the finish of this melody, on top

I alone standing.


But wait. 

"""" sounds like the konglish word for ""vertigo."" In the recording, I've always noticed that V uses a slight ""v"" sound whenever he says that word, but I blew it off as my not listening correctly. But truth be told, if anyone can accurately pronounce the ""V"" sound, its... well V...


However, if the word really is ""vertigo,"" it adds a whole deeper meaning to the lyrics just by changing this one word! It would roughly now be:

I am standing here with vertigo (It sounds better and makes more sense in Korean obviously).


Oooh doesn't that just fit the dark undertones of this song?? And really the whole Dark and Wild concept?


Word by word:

 = I  = alone  = vertigo  = exists

I am alone with my vertigo.


Can anyone confirm me on this?

P.S. If we're gonna get extra technically, """" is another word for hall and """" can be roughly translated as ""the way/of the ___ /by the way of the____."" So it could mean that by the way of the hall is where he is standing. But that's a whole other bag of beans.",3,12,False,self,,,,,

I think I really do like them a lot. They're so down to earth and determined, and like many ARMYs and casual fans, I think this is the first time I've listened to full albums instead of the most popular hits. It feels great to appreciate the music and hard work behind it, and not just the catchy tunes. But more importantly.. I'm very scared...? I like to say that I become obsessed with things very often, but in actuality I don't think I'm really the type to stay dedicated for long. Even when I loved SHINee and Suju and EXO, I was never able to buy any of their albums or merchandise. Sometimes I feel like I'm a self-proclaimed Kpop stanner who doesn't really practice what she preaches. Ive gone back and forth with Kpop, I was in love with it during my middle and early high school years, and now that I'm about to leave high school I'm getting back into it again. And this is all because of BTS.
I'm still a beginner when it comes to BTS and I've downloaded all their Korean albums on my phone and currently plan to buy them when I earn some money. But I wonder is it really worth it sometimes? I feel as though I'll be completely infatuated with these boys for 2 or 3 months and then become the girl who just scrolls past them on her tumblr dash or Twitter feed. I'm trying to keep myself up with them, watching all the bangtan bombs, reality shows they've participated in, and streams on the v app, and I really really enjoy my time alone just watching them goof around and be spontaneous, but sooner or later I feel as though it'll just all stop. I really really really want to stay committed to this group because they are just so special and genuine and full of everything I admire in people. sometimes I get scared when I think of the fact that I won't love them as much as I do now... Almost as if I'm just abandoning them or leaving them in the dust? In the past I've purposefully tried my best to stay attached to this fandom, which I think is unlike most people who say they can't escape because they're too in love or invested in it. I get worried that I won't be there or won't care when BTS releases even more amazing albums and mix tapes or when they experience the height of their careers. Overall I'm just constantly worried about how I will feel about them the next day. Will I continue to love them tomorrow or just not be able to stay committed?
Idk if I'm over thinking this or anything like that...but sadly this is how I feel about most things or people I come to admire. Does anyone else ever feel this way? Not expecting any solid nswers since this is kinda a strange thing I'm assuming, but it would be nice to have a talk ^^",27,12,False,self,,,,,

I renamed the title to be more specific.

One of my favourite songs from BTS is Satoori Rap. Korean dialects sound so cool. It's evident from their video clips that they embrace their accents and are proud of their origins. I read this very well-written analysis and it hits the nail on the head regarding BTS and Satoori. Thought I'd share as it's an interesting article! http://scarydeul.tumblr.com/post/69553391316/language-ideology-and-representation-in-btss
I like that their company hasn't forced the members to ""Seoul""ify their accents. Like I was surprised to find out GD was from Busan and it's nigh impossible to find him talking in satoori. Big Bang always seemed like a group that broke norms, yet it's interesting that a relatively rookie group (relative to Big Bang) wrote a song/rap about something that's not really talked about and seemingly ridiculed in mainstream Korean media. And it's fascinating that they've turned that notion on its head. 

I wonder how the general public felt about this song or if it gained any popularity in Korea itself? How do the Korean fans out there feel about this song?
Another question for the Korean fans since I'm genuinely curious. Is satoori associated with lower socioeconomic class?",17,30,False,self,,,,,

RM's is head on while somewhat concealed. It's fitting to me because he is a strong leader but a lot lies under the surface. You see him as the face of the group and has diplomatic answers in interviews but when he talks about himself you see how philosophical he is. Only 25% of Suga's face is showing which is reflective of his social anxiety and his introverted nature. RM's cover is simple. What you see is what you get. Suga's cover is complex by comparison. I think Suga is a complex person a lot it is below the surface but it's there. I like how both their covers were in black and white, They are similar in that they are all or nothing people so it makes sense.

I didn't really know how to say something this personal in the megathreads, I didn't quite know where it would fit. 

**edit** i've cross posted this to [my blog](http://hoseokked.tumblr.com/post/149018491824/agust-d-depression-and-me-a-thank-you-letter-to) so if y'all see it on tumblr, it's with my permission.

In the past year, Bangtan has been one of the precious few things keeping me alive and safe from myself. I could never really pinpoint why. 

And then Agust D dropped this morning, and I knew. This viciously angry, wounded, bleeding, raw Yoongi was like looking into a mirror and seeing my viciously angry, bleeding self. 

I was sixteen years old when I first realized how much I hated myself. 
When I was sixteen, Min Yoongi was eighteen and he realized the same thing. 

I've been crying in bed all day because of this album, because Yoongi opened his heart to us and I know *exactly* how black and ruined his own soul feels to him. 
It's like Yoongi ripped the words out of my very soul with this mixtape. The self loathing. The anxiety, the depression come out to play. Hiding in the bathroom, not recognizing yourself, not being able to explain it to anyone else. Being afraid of opening your eyes and breathing in the mornings, wanting to disappear, wanting to die. Not remembering who you are, who you used to be when you knew how to be a person. 

It's hard to explain what my life has been like in these past five years, but Yoongi did it for me. I feel like I need to thank him. He was so raw and honest about what it's like to struggle with depression, not mincing words or hiding it behind pretty metaphors and I was blown away. It's been twelve hours and I'm still shaken up at being known so very intimately. He goes to far as to mention psychiatry, the struggles of having to tell your family and your friends and a total stranger in that clinical little room that something is wrong with you that sometimes no one else can see, that your mind and your heart are trying to kill you.  

It's okay, Yoongi. I'm angry too. 
I don't know how to breathe too. 
I want to die sometimes too, I have *tried*. 

Thank you, Yoongi, for knowing. 
For feeling like this and creating art out of it. 
For being brave enough, tenacious and headstrong enough to lay yourself bare to the world. 
For holding my hand through your music and telling me that I am not alone, for saying that together we'll bloom past adversity one day. That life isn't always going to be this sick, angry, hopeless fog. 

I hope you can be proud of yourself for this, Yoongi. 
You deserve to be proud of this, proof that your work is powerful and brilliant and can shatter souls and put them together more healed within a single song. 
I hope you are gentle with yourself, I hope others are gentle with you, I hope you have found ways to breathe without choking. 

I hope you are warm and safe and prosperous, I hope you bloom every single day. 

Thank you. 
Thank you, so much. 

Love,

4th AND FINAL EDIT: 

Hello /r/bangtan! As you guys probably already know, we as a sub are doing the *We will be in full bloom* (   ) project. In essence, we will be compiling letters and sending them to Yoongi thanking/congratulating him for his mixtape. The project will consist of our personal letters and photos only; no individual gifts or fan art, sadly. If you would like to send him a gift you can do so yourself to this [address](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/4xzr5y/letter_compilation_for_yoongi/d6kjdj9). Or if you'd prefer sending him your lovely fan art, send it to [this lovely project](http://noej.tumblr.com/post/148993942715/mixtape-fanbook-project-%EC%88%98%EA%B3%A0%ED%96%88%EC%96%B4-good-work-good) that is also for Agust D.

We encourage everyone to participate and help! You can scroll down to **HOW ELSE CAN I HELP?** for more information. Please read the guidelines for the project down below thoroughly before messaging us.




**DONATIONS**

Since we will need donations for this project to succeed, **we will require participants to donate a small amount**, or 'buy' a page off the book. All donations will be used for the book production and shipping costs to Korea, along with the tiny gift we plan to add (more information below). We ask participants to [donate](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs) a minimum **$2 USD** for their space in the book. A 'space' in the book is 2 pages; 1 for the original letter + optional photo and the other for the Korean translation of the letter. Letters submitted in Korean will automatically be 1 page although you're welcome to submit a photo for the extra page. [Sample graphic](http://i.imgur.com/O8fD49P.jpg) on how we envision each page to look like! We hope the minimum amount isn't too much to ask! You are also welcome to donate more than the minimum amount :)

If you are choosing to write your letter **in English, we are asking that you keep it simple, so that he can understand** or if someone is translating for him, they can get the meaning across easily. Your letter must be **free of grammar errors**, to maximize our time organizing and preparing things. However, if you would like it proof read (as we understand that English might not be everyone's first language), please **include [name/username] Submission  (here, specify PR Eng/Kor) in your subject line** when you are emailing us to ensure that the translator will read it (e.g. *[u/ foryoongs] Submission  PR English*).

Two days ago I went to BTS Epilogue in Tokyo, the final concert of their Asia tour (14th of August), and so Ill write a short fan-account about my experience! Hopefully this will be fun to read, and also good information for anybody planning to attend a k-pop concert in Japan. This will be pretty long, but Ill try to structure it so its easy to read.

To begin with: I have never been to a k-pop concert, but been a k-pop follower since 2010-ish. Im a 21 year Swede (hence interesting English in this post) but I had planned a vacation to Tokyo, which happened to be the same time as BTS would perform!

**Tickets:** 

Was definitely the hardest part. I cannot say in detail how we got them as it was my friend who got them, but it was resale tickets. We bought them for 24 500 yen (approx. 240 dollars), original price however was 9 800 yen. Long story short: its almost impossible to buy Japanese tickets from abroad, as you need a Japanese phone number (and address I think) in order to purchase them. My friend had a Japanese contact shes bought merchandise from previously, and he bought her the tickets on resale for us. We got them from him the same day as the concert, all very smoothly!

**Before the concert:**

When we arrived at the venue at around 10 am, there was a HUGE line for the merchandise tent. It was really hot as well sunny, over 30 degrees, and stone/asphalt radiating heat from the ground. Since we were on vacation we decided to not stand in the line and went walking around/eating lunch in Harajuku instead. When we came back a bit before 3 pm when the doors would open, and there was no queue to the tent. However, most merch were sold out, but light sticks, photo books, towels, randomized photo cards, shopping bag and some other things were still available. Generally, the things that were member-specific sold out quickly.

**The people at the concert:**

Mostly girls, a few fanboys (as expected). What was unexpected for me however was the age! I found that most people I saw was around 23 maybe, not that many under 20. This surprised me as I reckoned that in Korea they were more popular with middle/high school students (wasnt there something about BTS being the most popular group for elementary students?). The Japanese fans seemed mostly to be noona fans, even with some ahjumma fans, like moms going together to the concert (I even saw a grey-haired woman with a Yoongi-fan!)

**The venue:** 

Im not sure how many seats there were, but there was only seating, even on the floor. People stood up the whole concert however, even us on the sides (obviously). It was no shoving or problems on the floor from what I could see, it seemed pretty calm even when BTS was throwing signed little balls to the audience. I was sitting in the back, but could still see them very well when they were out on the catwalk thingie.


**The atmosphere at the concert:**

was pretty interesting. Since I havent got any previous k-pop experience and no previous Japanese concert experience, I cannot really say why, but these are the things I noticed:

* The Japanese fans were quiet during the songs, especially ballads. Not even screaming in instrumental parts of the songs (like after the chorus, before the second verse in Autumn Leaves So epic, yet quiet). 
* They only screamed when there was music when there was fanservice (occasionally when there were zoom-ins on the screen of mainly the makane line)
* After every song, they would only scream/applaud for about 2-3 seconds (I counted) and then go quiet until the next song, making it almost awkward to me? Maybe I'm too used to excessive screaming/applauding
*  The audience was respectful to BTS when they spoke. No interruptions with desperate oppa I love you or anything like that
* Id say 95% of us had the official light stick. Or maybe more. Lots of ARMY Bombs!
* All of the BTS members got a lot of love and cheers, but the makane line was definitely the most popular. Jongkook got them noona fans in Japan

**The music:**

Amazing. They had a proper live band, proper microphones (handheld), proper sound management. This blows even the best music shows out of the window (obviously). The live band gave power to the songs, and gave them a bit more live-edge if that makes sense. The vocals were stronger (carried though more?) than in music shows and in other live performances Ive watched, and I really liked that. Think acoustic clearness of vocals yet with heavy instrumentals!

**The language barrier:**

Even I could tell BTS Japanese was quite basic. But since they were happy and mispronunciations were actually appreciated by the audience (kawaii~) this wasnt really a problem. They didnt have a Japanese MC or anything like that, and their speeches were pretty short. They only spoke longer in the interludes where short interviews were played on the screens, where BTS spoke in Korean with Japanese subtitles.

**The ~~(bulletproof)~~ boys:**

Were all professional and great performers. Their charisma is real, thats all I can say really. Their personas are the same in the concert as in variety/Bangtan Bombs. Suga was pretty funny, and Jimin was more precious than fanservice-y (*except for No More Dream of course*) than I thought. Im not even sure what to say, just that they exceeded my expectations a lot, and they were pretty high.

**Now to the actual concert!**

**Intro: Fire MV**
This was pretty weird. The whole venue, chanting *FIYAAAA-H* to the MV, without the boys even being presentBut it built hype!

**Run  Danger  Autumn Leaves  Tomorrow  Butterfly  Love Is Not Over  House of Cards  What Am I To You  Boy in Luv - Interlude**
These were the opening songs to the concert. Run and Danger, two solid title tracks. Autumn Leaves, Tomorrow, and House of Cards are three of my absolute favourite BTS songs, with amazing Tomorrow-choreography Boy in Luv is such a hype song to hear live, and the audience actually made some noise!

**Save ME  Fire  We Are Bulletproof Pt.2  Cypher Pt.3: Killer  Intermission**
Save ME and Fire were amazing performances, with sharp choreography and solid fanchants. But the real hype came with We Are Bulletproof. You have not lived until youve heard Jungkook say ireumeun Jongkook live. Cypher was HYPE. 

**If I Ruled the World  Baepsae  Dope  Boys With Fun  Attack on Bangtan  No More Dream**
After Fire and Save Me, I almost became worried that the concert was reaching its end considering that theyre the last. I was so wrong, all these songs were so HYPE. Especially Boys With Fun seemed like a personal favourite with the Japanese audience! With these songs, they ran around a lot on the stage between the choreo, hyping the audience.

**Encore:**

While waiting for the encore, the fans were mostly quiet. After a while, some *BTS! BTS!* chanting began, but it never really took off in our section. Then, suddenly people started to sing the chorus of Young Forever., and everyone joined in. We must have sung it at least 10 times, and it actually sounded really good and clean in the venue (not like other concert-screaming-singing Ive participated in before haha). We kept singing until another intermission (interviews) begun.

**Intermission  Epilogue  Young Forever  Whalien 52  Miss Right  A Japanese song I think For You  I Need You**

Im not exactly sure here about the song order. The other songs on the set list were the same as previous concerts, but the Encore was where they had their Japanese Only-songs. Also somewhere in here I think they had a short instrumental showing off all the band members and their instruments (drum solo, guitar solo etc). 
These songs were great to end the concert with. Starting the Encore with Young Forever and ending it with I Need You was perfect. Then they ended the concert with walking around, thanking the audience properly, and finally, after a long time, disappeared behind the closing HYYH logo. EPIC.

**After the concert:**

The organisers helped everyone to come outside. It was cramped but calm as people made their way back to Harajuku Station. Everyone was nice, no problem getting to public transport!

Now this was SUPER LONG and took quite a while to write. Please ask me questions if you have any and Ill do my best to answer, it might take a day though because Im still on vacation!

**TL;DR: 10/10 would sell my soul to see BTS again.**

I think many of us would agree that in all idol groups, the group that has the potential to reach Bigbang-level of stardom is none other than Bangtan. I'm here to just give my thoughts as a VIP and ARMY. 

Let me explain. Many people, Armys or otherwise, have misconceptions of Bigbang. They think of some glorious group that has tons of fans because they have good songs and look good. That's partially true; Bigbang's international appeal has opened them up to a larger scale in the new fans they've gained who don't necessarily like kpop. But beneath the crazy MVs and well-produced tracks is a group that found, through trial and error, their unique style. From their utter obscurity at debut, to local popularity and success, to the Alive album which blew them into worldwide fame. As many fans love Bigbang for 'Bang Bang Bang' or 'Fantastic Baby', there are just as many who reminisce on the songs that shaped their childhoods. 

I'm not here to give a history of Bigbang, though.

You guys can see the similarities, of course: idol group who got their roots through underground rap and hip hop, self-composing and producing, lots of hard work and dedication and passion for what they do. More importantly, they are friends. Guys who can stay close through the years and not just put on a show for TV. No matter how well some groups slap on the fanservice, really being comfortable and close with each other is a charm. It's the only way Bigbang has stayed together for 10 years, how after all they've changed, they can still hold world tours singing songs again and again. 

Many groups have weak links - pairs who are awkward or not close enough to be comfortable. It shows. But Bangtan is truly the one group I have seen besides Bigbang who has that connection, that closeness and kindness in each member.  What are the chances that 7 random talented guys put together each have a good personality and are compatible with everyone? This 'real' quality, I think, is what truly captured the hearts of jaded kpop fans and new ones alike. 

Another point is their passion. It's something you need in this industry to survive. You hear all these idols quitting or disbanding - for some, being an idol was nice but just wasn't their dream. For Bigbang, who have been together for so long, even being chosen for the group was a dream. GD and TY who trained since kids, TOP who lost so much weight just to be qualified, Daesung who went against his parents' wishes to sing and ignored others who called him ugly, Seungri fighting with Hyunseung over the last spot and only just managing to make the cut. 

For BTS, who have performed more tours than many of their sunbaes and hoobaes, being an idol is not for the popularity or fame. Of course, you all know this by now, and what each member went through to achieve their dream. How often can you think of other idols who simply chose this path for the glamour, for the fun of it? There's too many.

I guess what I really am saying is that in all these groups over the years, no group has compared to nor touched me in the way Bangtan has. They truly are special. You see those popular, trendy groups with company-produced songs? Sure they'll be famous in Korea and have lots of fans. But to truly touch their audience, to connect with the whole world like Bigbang has done... I think only Bangtan can do it.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wxCNICU6XQ) is Bigbang's performance of their first hit song, Lies, wearing the clothes from 10 years ago.

One day in the far future I hope I will see bangtan doing the same, singing HYYH songs and remembering their rise to fame. Honored and proud to be a part of their past and future :,)",7,33,False,self,,,,,

As you guys probably already know, we as a sub are doing the *We will be in full bloom* (   ) project. In essence, we will be compiling letters and sending them to Yoongi thanking/congratulating him for his mixtape. The project will consist of our personal letters and photos only; no individual gifts or fan art, sadly. If you would like to send him a gift you can do so yourself to this [address](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/4xzr5y/letter_compilation_for_yoongi/d6kjdj9). Or if you'd prefer sending him your lovely fan art, send it to [this lovely project](http://noej.tumblr.com/post/148993942715/mixtape-fanbook-project-%EC%88%98%EA%B3%A0%ED%96%88%EC%96%B4-good-work-good) that is also for Agust D.

We encourage everyone to participate and help! You can scroll down to **HOW ELSE CAN I HELP?** for more information. Please read the guidelines for the project down below thoroughly before messaging us.

**Number of submissions as of SEPTEMBER 4TH: 26**


**DONATIONS**

Since we will need donations for this project to succeed, **we will require participants to donate a small amount**, or 'buy' a page off the book. All donations will be used for the book production and shipping costs to Korea, along with the tiny gift we plan to add (more information below). We ask participants to [donate](https://www.paypal.me/foryoongs) a minimum **$2 USD** for their space in the book. A 'space' in the book is 2 pages; 1 for the original letter + optional photo and the other for the Korean translation of the letter. Letters submitted in Korean will automatically be 1 page although you're welcome to submit a photo for the extra page. [Sample graphic](http://i.imgur.com/O8fD49P.jpg) on how we envision each page to look like! We hope the minimum amount isn't too much to ask! You are also welcome to donate more than the minimum amount :)


Please don't let the donation part of this project turn you away from participating! We want to help in any way possible. That being said, please feel free to contact /u/emisaysmeow if you need any financial aid!

**WRITING GUIDELINES**

* Your letter should be **between 250 - 500 words and typed out as a Word document**. Unless your letter is already written in Korean. If this is the case, then your letter can be a full page (front only). The difference in length is because English letters will still need to be translated to Korean. **Handwritten letters must be scanned vertically**.

* Messages can be Korean or English. If you are choosing to write your letter **in English, we are asking that you keep it simple, so that he can understand** or if someone is translating for him, they can get the meaning across easily. Your letter must be **free of grammar errors**, to maximize our time organizing and preparing things. However, if you would like it proof read (as we understand that English might not be everyone's first language), please **include [name/username] Submission  (here, specify PR Eng/Kor) in your subject line** when you are emailing us to ensure that the translator will read it (e.g. *[u/ foryoongs] Submission  PR English*).

* Your letter **CANNOT contain anything inappropriate or any sexual content** - we will remove your letter without warning if it violates this rule. (Examples of inappropriate content include but are not limited to the following: any references to: sex, BTS/nonBTS pairings/couples, self-harm, criticism directed to Yoongi's parents/family/friends, 'stalkery' tendencies, etc.) We trust the people in this sub can discern between what is appropriate or not even if it's not on the sample list!

* To highlight the diversity of Yoongi's fans we decided to add a list of countries where the letters come from. If you don't want to share this information, you don't have to. 

* Other than your Reddit username, Twitter account, full/first name, country, please **do not include any other personal contact information**.

* Please **keep the tone of your letter positive**; the goal of the project is to thank/congratulate him for his mixtape release.




**PHOTO GUIDELINES**

* 1 photo per participant

* Photos should be related to your letter and reflect the positive tone of the book; we suggest photos of your country like landmarks or photos of your daily life that inspire you. This is **just a suggestion and including a photo pertaining to the letter is purely optional**.

* Please **include a clear and clean picture of your signature on a blank sheet of paper, as well. Including a signature is mandatory**.

* Please **include a screenshot of your PayPal receipt**. So, to clarify, if you are submitting a photo pertaining to the letter you should submit a total of 3 photos (the photo + your signature + PayPal receipt). And, if youre not submitting a photo then you should you should submit a total of 2 photos (your signature + PayPal receipt).

* No fantaken photos, fanmade graphics/art if it's not your own, unless you have the **permission of the owner to use with credits** (include their name if the photo isnt already tagged).

* Submitted photos should be in **.jpg format, either height or width should be at least around 1500px.**.  

* If you want to add a photo caption, include it in the Word document. Mark it with **photo caption**, so we can differentiate it from the letter.  




**SUBMISSION GUIDELINES**

* Submissions should be sent to foryoongs@outlook.com with the subject line: *[name/username] Submission  (here, specify PR Eng/Kor)*

* Photo submissions must be sent to us as an **email attachment**.

* Please allow 24 hours for us to email you back.

* All submissions will be **DUE ON SEPTEMBER 4th at 11:59PM KST**. And if you would like your letter proof read, all submissions will be due on **AUGUST 31st at 11:59PM KST (SEPTEMBER 2nd at 11:59PM KST at the very latest)** to ensure that we have enough time to get back to you with the corrections.  If you do not adhere to these deadlines **you run the risk of your letter not being translated/proofread/included**.

* We will be **checking all submissions**. All components of your submission have to be appropriate, otherwise your submission (letter, photo, and all) will **promptly be deleted**. No buts or ifs.  




**GIFT FOR SUGA**

* Along with the compilation of letters and photos, we will be sending our marshmallow a small gift as a sub, so suggestions for the gift are open. Our only criteria is that it must be wearable. Feel free to **comment on this thread under the GIFT IDEASFOR YOONGI comment, and upvote your favorite**.




**HOW ELSE CAN I HELP?** 

* We need translators! **If you or anyone you know speaks Korean and is willing to help us translate**, please PM us here on Reddit.

* We also **need someone to help us deliver the book in person to Big Hit**  there's way too many horror stories in different fandoms of gifts not making it past building reception. We all don't want our hard work go to waste, right? We want our thoughts and letters to make it to Yoongi's hands! So if you or someone you know are in Seoul and can help us with the delivery, please contact us via PM.




We understand that your letter can contain extremely personal information, and due to that fact, **your letter will never be shared in any way outside of this project**. 




If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to PM us here on Reddit. Thank you for reading and we hope a lot of people will join!",33,41,False,self,,,,,

I was watching videos of kpop groups listening and watching the performances of other groups. As I was on a bit of an EXO binge (as I had not listened to them in a year), I came across this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22hCY1aWw0. 

The whole time I kept looking at corner at these two boys grooving to the music. Something about that just tugged at my heart. Like, here are these two guys who were just genuinely enjoying and appreciating the artists on stage. It was such a contrast from everyone else. And so the stanning started...I am honestly so glad to be a part of this fandom, and hope to continue following this revolutionary group for many years to come. 

Random thoughts:

- I can't decide my bias anymore...I went from Jimin to V to Suga to Rapmon to JHope. Jin's ahjussi jokes are killing me (love his puns...they are so under appreciated). And Jungkook just being amazing at freakin' everything! I think I'll just fangirl them all :D

- What I would give to be a fly on the wall somewhere in Korea and see the reactions of various figures in the Korean music industry listening to Yoongi's mixtape...namely B-Free, Bobby, Zico, Tiger JK, SM artists....heck everyone...I would love for this to be some kind of turning point that gets companies to loosen up on their idols in terms of their artistic expression and allow greater involvement in the creation of their music/image.

I ran into BTS last week, and have been searching all across the web only to be awed at the unexpected popularity of this relatively unknown (to adults, I mean) group in Korea. 

With each member's superb talents proved in the clips that I randomly watched on Youtube, I am kinda asking myself how on the earth these guys are not known more in their own country. Seriously, I came to know them only last week... 

So, reading articles and youtube replies, I felt very interested in how far this group can rise at international level. In terms of Korean domestic market, I am half hopeful and half hopefuless. These days, Korean media is more dominated by big companies in many ways, and I wonder BigHit can actually break through the wall. But the amazing talents these boys have (I cannot even choose one member, it is so clear that they are all uniquely talented and well bonded with one another). 

I have no hint of BTS's current level of popularity or future possibility in international market. 
Do you think they can rise up to BigBang or TVXQ or CL level? To be honest, I have only some clue on these three group's international popularity either. Please shed light on me on this issue. Thank you. ",76,52,False,self,,,,,

Hello BTS,

By the time you read this letter its probably the end of 2016 already. Everyone has struggled so much this 2016, but I firmly believe that the things right now will have rewards for our efforts.

When we attend the awards ceremony on December 25, 2016, hopefully we can achieve Daesang, because we all have been working hard, right? Although this year is about to end, BTS still has a long way to go. 2016 might be over but our  hasnt ended yet.


BTS will be forever.

A Message from Bangtan to their fans :)


**From Jimin:**
&gt;Hello ARMY fans. Its me Jimin. I didnt know Id be able to compose a video letter but Im glad I have the time. Ive made a lot of memorable memories today. I think these memories that weve made on this trip will be a source of strength and driving force for me. This opportunity is all thanks to you all. So I want to say thank you. And now when we head back to Korea, recharged, we can work hard and rehearse and practice and put on great shows for you all.  Ill work hard to show you the best that I can do. Thank you.

 
**From J-Hope:**
&gt;Were at the end of a long trip Were on a train thatll take us part of the way back to Korea. While Im on this train, our ARMY fans are who come to mind. Im a singer. Ive always felt that as a singer thered be no singers without fans. Because of you, our fans, Im always grateful that youre all out there for us. Even while Im on this train, I feel like the train is special. Its taking me to our ARMY fans. Im waiting for the day that we can come back and show you everything weve been working on. The products of our work. I want to get home quickly and show you what weve been doing. Thank you for always supporting me. As J-Hope of BTS I want to be someone that youll always remember. Thank you everyone. Love you guys.

 
**From Jin:**
&gt;Hello ARMY fans. Im Jin, the oldest member of BTS.  Im human so I needed some time to rest up. Im happy that I had this time to relax and to be returning. Were all... Jimin is watching me right now*. Im really happy that we had this chance to go on our first trip. Now were going to work harder and show you an even better side to ourselves and show better shows. I hope that youll always be there waiting for us. I love you guys. Bye!

 
**From V:**
&gt;ARMY! Im on a trip. I cant sit here and tell you every detail, but if I sum it up its the best trip ever. You can see it on my face, right? Have I ever looked this happy? I hope that you watch these videos and that you have the chance to come. Thank you. Bye

 
**From Jungkook:**
 &gt;Hello ARMY fans. Im Jungkook.  Ive shown you a lot of myself since I was 17 years old. Youve seen me grow up and Ill work hard to become a great adult. I hope, more than ever, that in the future the 7 of us will continue on together. We wont ever forget this trip and well continue to work together. So I hope youll all be there with us forever.  Thats what I wanted to say. The 7 of us and you, lets stay together. Thank you.

 
**From Suga:**
&gt;Hello ARMY fans. Im Suga and Im saying hello to you from Finland in northern Europe. Today, we finished our trip through northern Europe. Its our first time coming out on a trip together like this. Just coming out here without the support of our managers, its a first for me and its been a fun trip. The whole reason we can even go on a great trip like this is because more than our hard work or good fortune, its because of your love and support. Thats why** we can travel so far from Korea and travel through northern Europe. I want to say thank you all through this message. Its the end of this trip but BTS still has a lot more time to spend with you all. So Im not disappointed about the trip ending, at all. I think we got to heal and now its back to Korea to make a good album. Well work harder. Its been a great trip. Thank you.

** they had while in the subs but why seemed to be the more fit word.

I never really got into them as in watching their subbed vids and stuff, just listening to their music and watching their MV's.

 So what I really mean to say is that is there any ""must watch videos"" (you know, every group has some) preferably subbed. 

I also like the way they dress so I would be grateful if you guys recommend me some fansites that I could follow on Twitter. pls and thank you!",15,8,False,self,,,,,
