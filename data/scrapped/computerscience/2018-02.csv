So I am about to graduate as a senior in computer science. I went the BA track which at my school is the same amount of programming, but with one calc class instead of 3. I took a minor in business as well.

As much as I like to program, I don't feel ready quite yet for the real world or interviews. I'm dealing with a divorce from my spouse during my senior year of college (we were only married a year), and I am also dealing with some mental health stuff (depression, possible bipolar depression, anxiety). School is going okay, but I need some time to go back to my hometown come graduation and get some help before I enter into anything new that is stressful. 

I intend to continue to work on personal projects. I decided that while I am applying for jobs after graduation, I will not add that to my plate of stress while I finish out the year, so I am not really having a goal oriented of having a job right out of school. 

Did anyone decide to take a year off? How hard was it to get a job since you weren't technically a ""new grad""? 

Also- I would prefer not to have any ""advice"" along the words of ""dont you'll not be motivated to program outside of class"" or ""taking a gap can turn into a long time"". I know these things, I just need to take one for my own wellbeing.

    b[10:19]

and do this loop

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++)
         a[i] = b[i];

Would there be any performance degradation after a certain number of cores are added?  Sorry if a silly question but wondering if say theoretically I had a 10 core cpu the above code could be processed on all 10 cores simultaneously right?  Since the individual elements of a and b at index i are only needed for that index. Adding another core is when you start to see no performance gains?

However I need help distinguishing between them and your thoughts on each's functionality.

One is data science: Data science addresses aspects of how to capture, manage and use the huge volumes of data generated by businesses, organisations and science in the information age. This specialisation spans technical areas such as programming and databases, through modelling, visualisation and analysis, as well as legal and ethical issues.

the other is advanced comp sci: In this specialisation you will learn advanced aspects of computer science including a detailed study of programming paradigms, especially object-oriented programming and parallel computing. This will be enhanced with experience in constructing, manipulating and analysing the performance of advanced algorithms and data-structures.

Some examples of such teams include computer scientists working with biologists, civil engineers collaborating with health professionals in disaster preparedness, or the kind of work youd find in NSF IGERT programs.

Our research is part of a project called Networked Expertise in Multidisciplinary STEM Collaboration, that is being conducted by Dr. Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher at the University of Waterloo in Canada. We want to know how you identify experts outside your own area of research so we can better prepare students for working across disciplines.

All that participants need to do is fill out an online survey that takes, on average, about 8 minutes (https://uwaterloo.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ehYHYHT74LebscB), and then have a brief interview with one of the members of the Networked Expertise team (which can take place via Skype/Hangouts/teleconference). This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee.

Keep in mind, everything is a floating point when it comes to the answer you can never have the ability to see perfect vision. 
I call it fractal theory, or the the essence of life and death.
Okay, does this make sense to you?

If (P != NP) then 
Positivity = 0
Negativity =0
Reason = 0
Focal Point = 0
Vision = 0

Else if (P = NP) 
Positivity = 1
Negativity = 1
Reason = 1
Focal point = 1
Vision = 1

In other words 
if
Positivity != 1 or
Negativity != 1  and
Reason != 1  and
Focal point != 1)
Then
Vision = 0


(Positivity)+(Reason)+(Negativity)+
(Focal Point)=(Vision)

Vision = End Result/Destruction or Creation/Birth of an idea

Positivity = Increase in the Factorial expression

Negativity = Decrease in the Factorial expression

Reason = Questions or Doubts

Focal Point = Floating point or Defintie point

Random thoughts or questions I've asked myself below....

Consumption is time, the
4th element to life is self and the 5th is the result.

The next step on Fractal Theory on how to work out if something is recursive or not recursive, though it should explain it above but you can decide :)

If you know the factors of everything you can create anything and destroy anything. Pretty much if the Vison = 0 its dead or no longer here, which is impossible to be or see in the presence and the end of the fractal itself.

Humans are the true act of random, that's the Factorial or fact of life.

Maybe another thing to see is that if vision is 1, can predict the future or see the past.

Any answers you can provide would be extremely helpful. Also, if you dont mind adding some context, please include your year of graduation or class level (fresh, soph, grad, etc.) if you are currently a student.



What is the general atmosphere of the program? Are people collaborative and outgoing or is it more dry and cut-throat?


How is the work load / life balance for the average student?


How diverse is the student population within the program?


What are the professors like? Are they accommodating and helpful, or are they just there for the paycheck?


What types of programs do students make? Is the content of the curriculum focused on a particular area?


How is UMasss COMP SCI program unique when compared to other schools?


What do you like most about studying COMP SCI at UMass?


What do you like least about studying COMP SCI at UMass?


Are you considering transferring to another schools COMP SCI program? Why?


Are there any other blatantly obvious factors that contribute to quality of life for COMP SCI majors (which would be specific to UMass and that one would otherwise have no knowledge of unless they were a student in the program) that I havent addressed here? For example, the FAC is like a dungeon and this plays a big factor into the lives of students who study there (I can attest).

I study at a low tier university I'm in my first year and the pace is hurting and that's really bad since I hadn't done any programming before starting my degree.  I've learnt the basics in 3 languages now through university contact hours (lectures, workshops etc) by basics I mean your arrays, conditionals and loops and what not. Still trying to understand where this degree is going to be honest... Somewhere I'm sure... 9 grand to and I kid you not. Spend an hour playing with Lego in a tutorial to ""help us better understand objects and their relationships"" for a module in object oriented programming... Just... Why?

I've been trying to do more outside of my degree because I'm worried it's doing nothing for my future job prospects but gaming is a serious addiction for me. I'd like to curb it with something to really sink my teeth into programming wise. A project perhaps or a series of tutorials that actually go somewhere... Interesting?  I really like the feel of java so far. 

So I ask you good people of Reddit to help guide me towards something that will help me enjoy something I know I can enjoy but am currently sighing my way through.  

If you can't suggest some good tools for fun learning with clear goals even just to give a challenge to make something would be nice. Im a very driven person once I find something that shows an obvious progression and reward. (Probably why I play so many games) 

I've posted before but I didn't even know what i was looking for then. Now I have a bit of a better idea. Hope you can help me out

TL;DR :
University is boring me so far. I'm not an experienced programmer just my uni sucks balls. 
Want to learn with clear end goals in view so I can stop being addicted to video games and enjoy programming a lot more. I want to create. I want to build. I need a project to work on or... Something.

98,2018-2-9,2018,2,9,14,7wbff1,I'm working on a personal project about automatic knowledge acquisition between agents and I am looking for ideas for real application scenarios,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7wbff1/im_working_on_a_personal_project_about_automatic/,pachinkomadness,1518155363,"Hello readers. As the title mentions, I have been working for a couple of months in a personal project about automatic knowledge acquisition between agents and I need some ideas. I will explain what it is about very briefly:

* There are two types of agents: ""expert agents"" and ""client/questioner agents"". You can have as many experts and questioners as you want, but from now on I will only talk about a simple scenario in which there is only one expert and only one client.

* You assume that the expert agent has vast knowledge about a certain topic. The topic is abstract, it depends on the application domain you choose, and **you, the user, need to provide all that knowledge** to the expert. It can be a database, logic rules, facts, constraints, whatever you want.

* You assume that the questioner agent lacks and needs information regarding that topic.

* You assume that the questioner agent conceives the expert agent as an EXPERT in that particular domain and is **committed to believe in his qualified opinion**.

* The questioner initially makes a query to the expert. Then the expert sends an answer with a **justification**. The goal of the questioner is to be able to believe in that justification.

* Until the questioner achieve its goal, it will constantly make more queries/questions to the expert. The expert will answer them all just with the necessary information, but **the questioner may need to delete some of its previous knowledge/beliefs which are contradictory with respect to the expert's knowledge.** The algorithm guarantees that eventually the questioner achieves its goal.

* The algorithm also guarantees that the amount of previous knowledge/beliefs (that is in contradiction with the expert's) that the questioner will need to delete is always minimal.

* The questioner will delete all its contradictory knowledge **no matter what** because it's committed to believe in the justification from the expert. This obviously **only makes sense in certain scenarios** and really limits the spectre of application domains.

* If a questioner already learned from expert A, and then makes a query to expert B, the questioner may override knowledge that he learned from expert A if it is in contradiction with the new knowledge from expert B.

I made this post because I am looking for ideas for real application scenarios, not only to get more motivated, but also to think if my abstract project would work or not, and to think how would it be applied. By the way, this was programmed with Prolog. 

I hope you can give me ideas! If something is not clear I can answer any questions.

Thank you very much in advance!

Disclaimer: I'm not a native speaker.
So, we are doing a group project (thank god only 2 people) for the databases course. The course was basically 80% theoretical, modeling and restructuring er diagrams, relational algebra, normal forms and all that jazz. The teacher was somewhat unprepared on the finer details but the recommended book is good so I had really no issues on that front. Then in less then 10 hours we covered SQL. Even excluding the fact that this part was taught by a teacher assistant who was very unprepared, unable to answer most questions of they went over the basics, we didn't have any time at all for covering something more than the very basics. 
We then had to tackle the project, which was free with some complexity constraints. The issue is the database we have to work with, which is MariaDB 10.0.something. My classmate and I today spent around 6 hours writing a trigger that should have been working, works in MySQL and just doesn't in the remote environment we have been given. We are spending almost all of our time googling for how to do stuff that in my opinion should have been taught to us, like, I don't know, declaring some goddamn variables (yes,this wasn't actually covered, I'll leave to your imagination how much we are actually learning from this). This wouldn't be an issue, I love learning by doing, but we both feel like we are missing a lot of base knowledge to be productive. Compounding with this is the fact that a whole host of useful things that we studied are not supported, like check statements, those took us a while to realize they were not working because there weren't errors or warnings for us to see the issue. And that's just one thing. So on top of having to learn by trial we are having to debug a lot of things that actually work, just on a later version. 
Am unreasonable for being angry about this? Is this the norm? Because we are really losing it, and doing all of this during exam session doesn't help.",0,0

I've been extremely fortunate with the admissions process this year and have been accepted at both Stanford and Berkeley for a Ph.D. in Computer Science. 

Since the cities are almost the same (atleast the weather is?) and the cost of living is almost the same too, I guess the prestige of the university matters more. I would like to continue in academia post completion of my PhD and was hoping to hear what would other people's choice be if put in a similar situation.

I'm an international student so my perceptions about some of these things may be wrong, please correct them if that is the case. Some considerations that I have thought of:

Stanford
+ A degree from Stanford is very prestigious, more so than Berkeley (although Berkeley is a top school too)
+ Stanford is situated in a relatively lower threat neighborhood (lower crime rates)
- The area around Stanford is not very active.
- Palo Alto is extremely costly to live in and everything is far away.

Berkeley:
+ My research interests fit in perfectly at Berkeley.
+ Berkeley is a university town, and I like the sound of that. (will be confirming this during the visit days)
- The crime rates around Berkeley are bad.

I guess I just want to hear your thoughts on Stanford vs Berkeley. Feel free to add anything that I might not have taken into consideration yet too!

So I wanted to get some real feedback from actual developers in the industry/at big companies to see if I was up-to-par with entry level expectations.

I went through Gainlo and got matched with a senior engineer supposedly from Oracle for $150. He literally [asked me a leetcode question](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/description/) and basically didn't accept an answer that didn't match the top one even if the algorithm was the same. While I was coding he was typing away and chuckling about something on his end. When I would ask him a clarifying question or explaining my algorithm he just said ""uh-huh"" or ""yes"" occasionally and was overall just not engaged.

I finished coding a solution about 30 minutes in and he hurriedly tried to wrap up the interview because I'm sure he's paid per interview without any standards. All he told me was that it wasn't the most optimal solution, it didn't compile, that I should try to study more, work on my resume. His advice was read up on AVL trees(?), ubiquitous computing, SQL joins, bit manipulation, and some other obscure stuff which made it seem like he was totally out of touch with how interviews work now. To top it all off, he sent me some follow up feedback template with some high level, generic tips in all of the sections and the ""correct"" solution which really showed he was just winging it.

When I complained to Jake/Gainlo, they said that they could not arbitrate and that it was my word against his and that he had worked with them for a very long time and that this never happens. Jake basically said that I was being too sensitive about the feedback and that the best he could offer was a 50% discount on the next interview, which I assume would be with an even more novice interviewer.

I understand how open() works on these, and the semantics of fork() combined with read() and write(). However, I am confused about one thing.

When a process starts, its file descriptor table contains STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. These entries point to entries in the system file table. I know that inodes correspond to files, but do the corresponding entries for STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR have entries in the inode table at all? I don't suspect that they do, but I am confused because if input is coming from a keyboard, and output is going to a monitor, what do the entries in the system file table point to? When you open() a file, the inode is loaded into the inode table, is it the same for devices and such?

So I ask is it better to learn from someone else's code when using for a project and then maybe Appling what you gather from that to a personal project to see if you can duplicate the code or even modify it?

I am a student at Saarland University in Germany and currently doing a survey as part of my Master's Thesis. It is about a concept to extend Twitch (and similar platforms) such that viewers can ""modify"" or ""manipulate"" the streamer's hardware, room and gadgets during the stream.

Here are some examples: 

* Create arbitrary smells in the streamer's room
* Swap any two keys on the streamer's keyboard
* Project pictures that depict different environments onto the walls in the streamer's room (e.g. a forest, a beach or hell)
* Measure and display the streamer's current emotions or stress level in the stream

As it is only a concept, it doesn't actually matter how crazy the individual modifications may seem. So if you have about 20 minutes to spare, it would be great if you could help me out by completing this survey:

I'm a veteran of the U.S. Air Force and I am about to separate and transition into civilian life. I will be going back to college in the fall. For a long time I've entertained the idea of becoming an English teacher - I have an A.A. in English, was editor of my college newspaper, I've written most of a book, et cetera.  However, before I joined, I took an adult education semester focused in help desk support, and I learned a lot about technology and was quite intrigued by the possibilities of a tech job. However, I ended up joining the military, but the possibility of getting an IT job never escaped me.

So, now I'm getting out, and I have the G.I. Bill (4 years of college paid for), and I'm at a crossroads. I could go to college and get a degree in English and Secondary Education (a hybrid degree resulting in becoming fully certified for teaching). However, I remain intrigued by IT and I feel like learning CS at a college is a viable option for me. I certainly have more than enough free tuition to cover whatever path I choose.

Going for teaching English, I feel, would be the ""safe"" route, and there's so much more that goes into being a teacher besides teaching, and to be honest it's a big turn off quality of life wise. However, a job in tech remains a very intriguing thing. I fiddle with programming here and there, and I have a general interest in technology. The only catch is that I've never been good at math - however, now than I'm older, more focused (military disclipine)and am aware of my weaknesses (i.e. ADHD) and how to address it, I feel fairly confident that I can handle math beyond basic arithmetic so long as I apply myself.


Would taking my G.I. Bill and trying a major in C.S. probably paired with a minor in Creative Writing be a good idea? Or am I just intrigued by a vague idea and earning potential and the fact that I'm not a math whiz will be my downfall? Just curious about your thoughts in general. Thanks. :)",14,5

I tested it with tricky4(3) and the output was 8, which I believe is because it exits the if statement the first time and 3 is added to 5.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32677054/time-complexity-of-number-base-conversion

Nonetheless i ask the question here again, primarily because i do not understand the answer giver there and for another because i have some takes on the problem i would like to supplement with.

to reiterate we have a problem in CLRS which goes like this:

""Show how to sort n integers in the range 0 to n^(3)-1 in O(n) time.

There seems to be a consensus that we first convert the numbers into base n which ensures that each number is made up of at most 3 digits. then we can use radix sort to sort the number in theta(3*(n+n)) (k=n because we are in base n) =theta(n).

What i am concerned with is the cost of converting the n numbers to and from base n. Converting back to decimals is theta(1) obviously, so n conversions equals theta(n). But converting a decimal to another base takes theta(log(n)), so that the first n conversions to base n would take theta(nlog(n)) time and break the time complexity of theta(n) of the algorithm overall. I have read that you can view the expansion as a O(1) operation under the RAM model though i do not understand why(probably because i do not understand the difference between the RAM and BIT model in connection to complexities). In the original post the answer given also tries to explain how if integer arithmetic is done in O(1) time, then ""... converting a number to base n is basically most significant digit: x/n, lease significant digit: x%n,"" which i really dont get any of.

2- how much does a formal, rigorous knowledge of logic help you with computer science. Where can one go from logic- are there good industry applications, or is it mostly academia?

I feel like I've grown up on the internet. /b/, Ricky Astley, Technoviking, All Your Base, Nyan cats, He-Man, Douchbag Steve, etc,..  I recently turned 23. 

Right out of high school, I moved out and completely supported myself in my first year in college working online in web advertising. I was involved in the blackhat scene since 14 or so, which gave me all kinds of great &amp; terrible experience. I then dropped out of college early-on and used my experience to land a nice job in a small, multi-million dollar legal marketing firm at age 19. I learned a lot about business in this field and helped lawyers break 7-figures using custom software. 

The money was nice for not having a degree and for my age, but I began to dislike it very quickly. It seemed like my boss didn't do anything besides vacation around the world. Our website was a joke. We had a *FLASH* banner on the site.. I maintained &amp; upgraded the websites, performed on-site IT, handled a lot of the marketing efforts, I handled phone + email support and implemented all the changes for many extremely stressful clients (lawyers can be awful people). After nearly 4 years in this field, I decided to quit. They offered me a remote position which I declined..  

For about 6 months prior, I desperately tried to get an IT position. I've got an additional 1.5 years of experience in IT at my local school district when I was in high school, but apparently that's not enough.. I had applied for hundreds of positions leading to only one phone interview which led nowhere. 

I decided to moved back home to a very rural area. I made this decision before quitting, as my Dad accepted a position teaching at a local community college. I've been able to get free tuition. I'm currently working at a local auto-mechanic shop, which has been a great learning experience. I've got two school districts who want to hire me for IT, but no positions are currently available. 

I've got some side projects in the works, and feel like some of them have huge potential.. I also try to fix computers and build websites for locals whenever I can. Unfortunately I just have zero free-time due to school and work. I don't even have time to be typing this post. 

I feel like I've learned absolutely nothing in the last year in school. At this rate, I will learn nothing next year apart from what I learn working on cars outside class. I'm now taking HTML5+CSS &amp; Oracle SQL (the only CIS classes available in my area this semester that I can take), which has been an awful experience. So awful that I'm considering changing career paths altogether. 

I'd rather just follow a YouTube tutorial series'. We just read books, and take tests and quizzes directly from the book's test banks.. requiring knowledge of IDEs like Aptana? I do awful on these quizzes. I could do this more effectively on my own time. It also seems as though other students handle these classes better than me, which I don't quite understand.  I code better than them, they just seem to regurgitate the book's useless facts better than I can. I feel like I'm wasting so much time here. I worry extremely that the rest of my college education will be like this. I want to build my own applications in Python, Node, things I know I can sell and that have been on the backburner the past year+. Meanwhile I feel like I'm not getting any better with my skills. 

The police force/military seemingly won't consider me due to my prior drug history, which is a shame considering that I would love to pursue a career in Cyber Security from a law enforcement angle, such as forensics. I battled a lot of demons in my past, and with a lot of experiences I won't share (just for OPSEC reasons). 

Coming from a long line of educators, I could also see myself teaching programming at a Jr. High/High School (possibly younger) level. I could really see myself enjoying this field, but almost cannot see myself continuing with post-secondary computer science education due to my poor experience with it thus far. A bit ironic, seeing as HTML5+CSS should be Jr. High (or lower) level curriculum. Last year I taught my 14-year old sister basics of the Linux CLI and HTML. 

**TL;DR:**

I'm honestly very lost right now. I honestly don't know if I want to work in the private/corporate world again unless I'm running my own business. I simply want something fulfilling, I truly don't care about money. I can handle stress if I feel it's not being wasted. 

I feel as though I'm stuck between quitting my useful job to focus on school (an endeavor which seems to be getting me nowhere), or dropping out of school to continue actually learning skills (on vehicles; which, I surprisingly enjoy) while also starting my own business and continue in being self-taught.

I could also see myself getting certs. I've been given the opportunity of getting Google's new IT cert for free, as well as a CISSO infosec cert. I simply have no time for these right now both working/school full time.. 

I simply want to provide real value in this world.. tired of trying to figure this out on my own.. any advice is appreciated.

I'm starting uni this September, and have applied solely for comp sci courses. I really enjoy working with computers and software in general, and have been doing so since I was a little kiddo. 

I do have SOME experience with programming, mostly me trying to learn it using guides on YouTube and internet. It is something I really enjoy, and something that's a lot of fun when I actually get something to work, but I do feel like the workload on uni might overwhelm me. Also, I'm above average in maths and I feel quite confident there so that's not a problem really. It's the ammount of programming languages and the whole problem-solving aspect that bothers me.

Anyway, I now start wondering that choosing comp science wasn't the wisest choice, but maybe that's just my view of it. Any of you who started studying comp sci with the same experience/approach as me? Would appreciate to hear your opinions.",12,2

Ive also largely only focused on one language (PHP), at 32 years old Ive been working with that language for nearly 20 years (yikes!). 

Ive always wondered what I might have missed by not studying computer science, I feel like there is a breadth of knowledge and experience that Im missing. 

I have considered going back to school to earn a Masters Degree (I did earn a bachelors) but then again I dont know how much benefit Ill get from that, especially the amount of debt involved. Would a Masters degree be worth it? 

What other languages would be useful to learn? Ive been curious about Java, C++ and Objective C/Swift. A language is just a language though, for those studying computer science now Is there a course or topic that you found either really interesting or valuable? 

Id love to start a conversation about the kinds of knowledge/skills taught in school that are worthwhile, even if they arent a specific programming language.

You must first pass through a series of **n** rooms. Each room has two more doors that lead to two more rooms. After youve walked through **n** rooms, you find the room that may contain your prize. If you didnt find your prize, you are allowed to try again.


Just to be consistent, well define the physics of the world to work out any loopholes a real world perspective may introduce:

* There is no reason why one door would have a better chance of leading to a prize than the other, information cannot flow between the closed doors.^1

* Each room is exactly identical to every other room, empty; except for the final room, which has a prize, hidden behind one more door.^2

* For every room, you walk into, you split yourself into a specified constant **k** clones.^3


*Assuming a k of 1, is there a way to always guarantee you will find the prize on your first try?*


I say theres not. If there was, wouldnt you be able to solve the halting problem? Youd have a way to see into the future to find some arbitrary value. The worst case scenario for finding the prize is running through all 2^n rooms. However, if we set k&gt;1, we are always guaranteed to find the prize on the first try. We can find the solution in time n, in every case. When k is 1, depending on the case, we might have to search up to 2^n. 

If there was a solution to k=1 where the worst time wasn't 2^n, that would mean there was a way the person had information about the future states in order to not have to run through every state. We know this isn't allowed because information can't flow through closed doors, therefore we've reached a contradiction and a solution can't exist.

Id class solutions to **k=1** as *deterministic algorithms*, and solutions to **k&gt;1** as *non-deterministic algorithms*. Doesnt this show that no deterministic algorithm could solve this problem in P time like a non-deterministic one does? I feel like this also hints at the arbitrary nature of defining some algorithms as deterministic and others, every single type of solution where k&gt;1, as non-deterministic. 

* We may be given a formula that could specify exactly where the wrong doors were, but we calculate it by walking through doors (this is because information cannot flow between closed doors, so you cant know anything about the room beyond without first opening the door). This means the only way to use the formula to know if a path is wrong, is by walking along that path to compute the formula. I bring this up because the 3SAT formula can be used to tell you which path is the correct solution, but generating it is as expensive as just going through the path.^1

* This last bit might seem equivalent, the door with one final door, but I have this feeling that there is a relevance to the separation of finding a solution (entering into the final room), and verifying a solution (opening the door to check whether there is a prize there).^2

* The clones are all you, such that if they find the prize, you have found the prize. The clones try to walk through as many doors as they collectively can so that every door has a clone walk through it if possible.^3

***Edit***
Thanks for the responses everyone, it seems like input size for the problem is not consistent. If every room could be described by whether you entered through a left or right door, including the first room, then you could describe the path you are searching by shouting a series of n left or rights. So couldn't the input to the problem be described as, ""first shouting all the possible paths to the end that you are going to try""? We know there's no way to know information to help determine which path to take, so in order to describe all paths that could lead to the prize, in the k=1 case, it would take 2^n answers, the input would be 2^n long. However, if k&gt;1, you could implicitly say all the steps of the path for every room 1-n, in n time. The problem's input or space just became O(n), while it was O(2^n) for the other, and this change was due fundamentally to what a DA vs NDA is. This would again show there are some things a non-deterministic algorithm could do that a deterministic one couldn't with either different time or space, no? I'm sorry if I'm missing some clear point in all of this, I'd really like to know where my reasoning fails so I can go back to the drawing board!",2,3

The software's content will be animations and real-life videos made in co-production with kids, and as well as step-by-step exerises, allowing kids to see exactly where their mistakes are, and to view hint and tips.

I have a bachelor's degree in electronics and communication engineering. I am struggling to take the first step in the right direction. 

I am very passionate about theory and research anyday but I have lately developed a keen interest in doing practical projects. I am at the beginning stages of learning programming and basics of computer science by myself. 

Although I have an urge to serve my personal interests, I do have responsibilities and I have to take decisions that are in the best interest along those lines, being very specific, **financially**. *We* are getting by *just fine* as of now but I have to think in the long run.

I have always been interested in the theory and research but skeptical about the rewards, speaking financially. On the other hand, I have turned down certain offers since it was strictly just programming and hardly any opportunity to exercise creative freedom let alone exposure to R&amp;D.

I am quite perplexed and am in a perpetual dilemma. Academia or Industry? Can I get the *feel* of academia and financial rewards like the industry? Or am I pursuing a pipeline dream? Do I have to compromise one against the other? Or is it possible to have both and I haven't seen the world enough through enough windows of possibilities. Maybe in the likes of R&amp;D divisions of big companies like *FAANG* etc. Is it possible to get there, if so how do begin my journey? Or should I realize soon enough that that is in fact a pipeline. Since it will change the discourse of my life, there's pressure and I'm struggling to make a decision.

I don't mind working, like I said, I have deliberated myself towards that direction, but if I do choose to do this, I don't want the constant unrest in the background and false expectations that one day it'll be such. I would just like to be stress free and go all in just to focus on upping my technical skills and being simply practical and pragmatic in my approach to my career.

But in the slightest hope that, if in fact it is possible? How's it like and how do I get there?

Just to be clear, I'm not asking how to get into Google/ Facebook etc. I don't want to be Web Developer etc. Coz the I may get more money but at the end of the day it's pure industry. That's a different line of thinking. But I am interested in what Google is thinking in getting the next algorithm for better Maps. What happens in the meetings of those discussions? And I also love to work in teams while doing research, it's crazy fun and intellectually satisfying. How frequently do demands to such roles come up tech companies and what do I do to get there someday, if not today.

My request to the veterans and everyone who can give me valuable input here, in this field, is give me their perspective and overview on this matter. I know it's a very long post because it is that much important  to me. I research this a lot in my free time. I am fairly new to Reddit and I see how wonderful this platform can be.

They say prior experience helps, but for someone like me who doesn't, I'm not sure what options I have. People say I should do some side projects, but I am also unsure as to what kinds of side projects (or how complex must they be) that employers are looking for.

And as an undergrad, do you think it's feasible to get a CS-related part time job as early as now or should I just wait 'til I graduate before looking for a stable, full time job? The latter choice allows me to just concentrate on my studies and get good grades (idk if that matters to employers or not).

I've translated it into formal language. Sorry for being rude before. It can be frustrating to write a paper and have people misunderstand it. Now there should be no misunderstandings.

* no algorithms are used
* no one way functions are used
* no oracles or circuits are used

The proof uses a new tool called a sorting key, which is a way of encoding how to sort a list and pass it between Turing machines.

Also, it's really, really important to understand that in the proof it's never stated ""this is hard and there is no algorithm for such and such"". I never present any algorithms and work entirely inside ZFC set theory using existential and universal quantifiers.

I'm also not claiming the proof is valid or asking for any sort of help. I just want feedback and, if I'm lucky, constructive criticism.

As you can guess this course does have a little bigger focus on IT then normal Gymnasium course. This school is also private which means i pay to go in it. The reason why i'm going here is because:
1) I had really bad grades so i didn't have a big choice.
2) I choose IT course because it was the closest thing that i like, and that they had.
So after half year in it, we didn't learn much stuff that i already didn't know (we were basically just working in Word, and are doing Excel this half-year). Seeing i choose IT, i want to learn programming and such things. But i'm not sure where to start. We do get to learn this in school but i would like to start ahead of others because i want to start as soon as possible. Choosing an IT career is very risky that's why i want to prepare myself. I didn't even know what a Programming Language is until today (or could be because English is not my native language). So yeah i don't know much about it. I'm a complete noob. I also understand that it also depends on what i would like to do with my IT career, if i wanna make web sites, or phone applications....
For me i always wanted to be a game developer and to make games, because i had so much cool ideas as a child but never got a chance to show them to anyone or to make them real. 
But i know being a game developer can't promise me a good job, that is it's very unlikely to work.
So i'm not sure what to do. For now i just wanna start somewhere and see where it takes me. And maybe after getting to know IT community more i'll understand what i wanna do.

TL;DR: So how do i start? Should i began learning one of the programming languages? If so which one? Or do i go to even more basic if there is haha?

P.S sorry for bad English....",5,1

As far as I understand it, the Diamond Problem is a situation where you have four classes, e.g.:

    class A:
        foo();

    class B (inherit from A)
        foo();

    class C (inherit from A)
        foo();

    class D (inherit from B) (inherit from C)
        pass;

(Apologies if my pseudocode is a bit unconventional, hopefully it conveys the situation)

And the problem arises when D calls its inherited method foo(), and how to know which method to call.

My problem with this is hopefully not in the fundamental understanding, but kind of as an aside - what's the point of Class C *also* inheriting from A? Surely by having B only, then when a poor linearisation is used it will still show that just using the inheritance order and following up recursively (D -&gt; B -&gt; A) would call from a less specific superclass (i.e, not C)?

I hope my question makes sense. If not, just say and I'll try and clarify. Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of the point of the problem?

I'm computer science student and it's about time to pick subject for Bachelor's degree thesis. Lately I'm interested in cryptocurrencies and I'd like to work on Bachelor's degree thesis on the topic of cryptocurrencies. Since I'm studying computer science, I thought about creating own cryptocurrency based on existing ones, such as BitCoin. Also, I would like the thesis to be based on theory, but also I'd like to have some practical example that will be created, or explained. It is also possible to cover economical influences of cryptocurrencies and stastical data about the cryptocurrencies since our faculty is combining computer science with business and economy.

Regarding creating own cryptocurrency, it is probably not a big challange to just use the existing code and compiling it for creating cryptocurrency so I'd like to add a single or a few features to it or make it usable for certain applications only (for example: usage in schools for grades etc.)

Also, I was browsing the web looking for some general tips on creating cryptocurrencies, but couldn't find any helpful articles. It would be excellent to see if there is some kind of documentation or explanation of code, how it is structured etc. In case that code is very complicated, I could also go with combining analysis of how cryptocurrencies work on technology level and on economy level with possible applications, integrations into other systems etc.

Could you suggest me:

* What would be interesting topic to write on cryptocurrencies?
* Which feature(s) could I add to existing cryptocurrencies and make it my own?
* Some books, guides, documentation etc. that could guide me through existing code and how to approach programming itself.
* Anything else you come up with

About me:

* I know C++, but I'm not an expert. I'm much more familiar with Pyhton. I know a couple of other languages, but let's say it's not a limiting factor since it would be swell if I could extend the rest of my knowledges that are not directly connected to the thesis
* I'm interested in possible real-world applications of technologies
