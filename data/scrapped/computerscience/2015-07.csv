I am majoring in CS and Math. My GPA is not great, but decent (3.6 from a competitive school). Most of my work and research (including a couple publications) have been focused in systems. However, I've become extremely interested in Computer Vision recently (from my own research), and I think it'd be a very good area for me to explore further in graduate studies. The only problem is that I have not taken any courses in CV (the only one at my school is only offered once every year), and my background in graphics is practically nonexistent (though I'll be taking a course on it this fall). My AI background isn't anything special, either.

I think that I'd have a much better chance of getting into better (overall) programs if I apply with a primary research focus oriented towards systems (and honestly, I still am interested in systems research).

I am not sure if it's the right place to post that kind of questions, but any input is usefull.

I am currently finishing my 4th CS year at university, and doing and internship in a bank to validate the year. I'm not gonna say where, but i will finish my studies next year.

In think i've lost faith in what i do.

I'm not sure about what is wrong : 

-  the technology i use : won't get to details but mainly J2EE
-  the private sector with its own rules, but generally only one : money
-  the way people work nowadays in general : stuck on the screen 40-50h/week not caring about what is really important
-  the software engineer job : maybe some others like architect, system engineer or project manager is more fun.
-  the way our work is used in general : i'm not sure the majority of people working (IT in our case) are making a better world

To be honest, i have no idea about what i'll do after i finish my studies, but the more i learn atm, the less i want to work.

I just want to find a passion, make a better world (ecology, music...)...so what i'm planning to do is either find a thesis on an interesting subject or build my own organic farm.

If someone is/was in the same situation and have some answers, i'll be glad to reddit.

With each generation, the total quantity of individuals possessing a characteristic with a particular intensity would divide into thirds, with 1/3 acquiring intensity an increment above, 1/3 an increment below, and 1/3 the same.  For example, if the starting population is 500 individuals of factor 50, then the next generation would have 166 of factor 49.5, 166 of 50 and 166 of 50.5.  Then there is rebalancing of the quantity associated with each factor depending on the fitness associated with each factor (which should be the easy part, so I will omit in the example).  And then there would be division into thirds again of the quantity associated with each factor:  55 of factor 49, 55+55 of factor 49.5, 55+55+55 of 50, 55+55 of 50.5, 55 of 51.

Let me begin by saying that this is my first time venturing to this subreddit, and I am impressed by the information provided in the sidebar and the quality posts. With that being said, I have a question which has already been moderately covered, but I feel like my situation is somewhat unique.

I am heading to college in the fall - OSU (Oregon State University), specifically - and I would like to major in computer science. My declared major at the moment is chemistry, so I haven't met with an adviser to talk about CS. The issue that I'm running into is that my college recommends taking MTH 251 or something similar your freshman year if you are pursuing a computer science major. I placed into MTH 112, as I haven't taken math since my freshman year of high school.

Now, I don't mean to brag, but I am fairly talented at math and it comes quite easily to me, I just decided to quit taking it in high school because I had already been getting math credits since 7th grade and wanted to take other electives instead. What I'm wondering is if I'm too far behind in math for a computer science degree to be a viable option, or if it's not too late.

I'm looking forward to the responses; thanks in advance!

&amp;nbsp;


So basically, I've tried out multiple programming languages and tried to learn them. However, I kept switching. All of them were C-family except for Haskell.


&amp;nbsp;


I'm not sure what I should do or what programming language I should learn. Currently, I'm a master programmer in Lua and an intermediate PHP programmer. Recently, I've wanted to learn Visual Basic .NET. I'm not even sure.


&amp;nbsp;


I need advice from the professionals. I need to stop switching around and focus on a language (obviously in addition to my Lua and PHP). I've revisited C multiple times, despite being old. Honestly, I think I'm in love with C. I've been wanting to learn it for a long time and I eventually want to program my own operating system in it (i know this is no easy task). I can honestly see myself as someday being a master C programmer.

&amp;nbsp;


What do you think? What's the best way I can settle down on a language? Should I follow my dream of C or start with an easier language such as Python? How should I go about daily/routinely studying the language to better maximum knowledges and remembrance?* Is there a good website with (free) courses to help learn?


*as you can see from my constant switching, i need a lot of help on this


&amp;nbsp;


Note: I'm no beginner to programming; I know how things work (for the most part), however, i could probably spend more time studying algorithms and programming concepts

-then to multiply and divide, 

-then learn to use exponents, 

-then learn, factorization, 

-after all that you learn basic formulas,

I'm looking for an informational page about how a computer works. This page is actually a perfect example of the idea and level of detail I'm looking for.

My question for someone far more experienced than me:

Is this article outdated? It makes mention of archaic technologies, so I feel like it might be, but I'm also not sure if computers have changed enough to make it truly obsolete.

If there's a better book (or preferably free article), could someone provide me with a link to it?
