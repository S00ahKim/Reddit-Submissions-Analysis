I don't like what I do but it pays OK. My situation is I get paid about 18-36/hr an hour for about 24 hrs a week.  I work 2 days a week Saturday, Sundays and Holidays.  What I do is a variety of things but primarily it is tech support.  Physically I am sitting in front of the computer all day but it is mundane stuff and not at all challenging.  I ideally want to find a paid internship that pays about the same.

My motivation for quitting is I don't feel that what I do is worthwhile anymore.  I am bored and I feel like my energy can be spent on other projects.  I have completed my resignation letter because I want an internship and a chance at real world experience.  I have not sent it because I am worried about not having an income and having to rely on loans.  Yes my husband makes enough money to support me and the kids but I like having a paycheck.  I don't know where to start and I'm not sure what kind of skills I need to make myself marketable.

1. My question is should I quit? I am not a normal undergraduate.  I am married with kids. What kind of compensation can I expect from an internship?  
2. Should I ask my company to give more challenging projects?  All engineering positions say full-time. I am also extremely awkward.  I just act however I want and don't really care about consequences or how I am going to be perceived.  But when I do try to make a good expression I usually have to research it.  So I would definitely like more advice on this.

Ok. so let me begin by saying that i am 16 years old and am a junior in high school. I've came to the conclusion a few months ago that i want to do something involving computers after high school and will be going to college for computer science or something closely related. 

PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS A PC VS. MAC DEBATE 

now that that's out of the way i have a few questions, 

1. should i get a mac?  id get a mac and call it a day because i really want to learn objective c and develop apps and software.( i have no experience with coding languages or anything but will be learning my first language after i get a new computer) however i'm still sort of young and its a little hard to come across a few grand that i can put towards a computer. 
     If i did get a mac i also don't know which one to get. my mom has the base model 13 inch macbook pro and i use that on occasion but it tends to get really warm after some moderate use.( i know my way around a computer and understand how most of the components work) 
and if i did get one i would at least want the base model 15 inch. but would that be enough for hard use? ( school work and personal work)


2. Should i get a PC? i'm debating wheather or not to get a PC, i'm only going to be in high school for two more years and when i graduate my parents were planning on getting me a macbook pro(base model) so i was thinking that ill get a PC now and then wait until they give me the $1,200 for the macbook and then pay the rest for the model i want. if i were to get a PC i would have a budget for about $800 total. 

3. my third and final question is if i get a PC, should i buy one or build one? id really like to build one, but im not sure if its the best option. i'm pretty confident that i'm capable of doing so, with a little help.
      i hear from people that buying a custom PC could oast some problems; Not being built properly, cost of shipping, lack of customer support, etc. 

so in any case, i apologize for this long, dragged out question, but i didn't know who else to ask. i would appreciate any help.

Consider a guessing problem, where you try to guess a secret positive integer in the range 1 to n.

Your algorithm should make as few guesses as possible.

Last semester a few people creating a programming club on campus and it wasn't too popular.  After the two leaders graduated in May, I gathered some of the existing members and we created an e-board, make fliers, registered for a table at this semester's club fair, and just got things organized and together overall.

At the club fair we really got a lot of people to sign up (probably because we had a drone and 3D printer on display).  We also advertised that we do tutorials, 3D printing, homework help, projects, and hopefully robotics in the future.  At the general interest meeting, about 40-50 people showed up.

A lot seemed really interested in coming back and so far we don't have too much planned for the next meeting except a tutorial in a language.  The new members' skills are ranging from no experience (art/business/comp sci majors) to graduate level (with undergrad bachelor degrees in comp sci).  It's hard to plan for meetings with such ranging skill levels.  We don't know if we should split people up into teams and start assigning projects, or what.  

Any tips/suggestions/ideas would be helping us so much!  Thanks all!

I graduated a technical college with an auto maintenance degree and am currently a maintenance specialist at a Honda dealer.

I went back to school wanting to go for mechanical engineering, but I lost interest in that quickly, and second semester I took my first CS class.

I have *no* prior knowledge of programming, took two basic-level algebra classes and two basic geometry classes in high school, and took Elementary and Intermediate Algebra at the technical college, and have taken College Algebra at the university. That's it.

I feel like this is my last chance at a career where I'm not only doing something that makes me happy, but also not huffing gas and oil fumes all day and not cutting/burning the shit out of my hands on a daily basis. And making a decent income.

As far as actual programming goes I know next to nothing compared to a vast majority of people here. I have bought a few teach-yourself-java books(haven't really gotten too deep into any of those yet), I've taken CS111/Intro to Computing I, stayed with everything throughout that class, I'm just pretty petrified of how hard it gets.

I had fears like this in tech school. Automatic transmissions, for example, I understand on a theoretical basis, but ask me to diagnose a valve body and I'm pretty clueless. I learned, though, that a large portion of it is learned *on the job.* You are run through the basics of it at school, but you're gonna re-learn it on the job, you're not gonna be expected to do an engine overhaul your first day on the job. Plus there are repair manuals and resources available for helping you solve complex problems. I'm hoping the same applies for a programming job or any CS-related career.

My question is, though, what should *I* do at this point. Barely any math to speak of, almost no programming experience (I'm trying to do small projects to keep up with it but I find myself stuck on pretty basic problems), and an estimated 4 years left in school.

Like I said, I'm going back in January. I'm going to start on one of these books and already have a small project in mind to try to complete, and I'm going to brush up on math so I'm not completely clueless in Pre-Calc.
