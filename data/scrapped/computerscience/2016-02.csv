I am a current first year college student who was directly admitted to be a Computer Science major, and I chose to pursue a Computer Engineering minor. I was wondering, is it possible to be a Firmware and/or Embedded Software Engineer with a BS in Computer Science and minor in Computer Engineering? My university's Computer Science program is in the College of Engineering, so we do have to do major courses such as Computer Systems, Assembly Language, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, etc. 

I feel like I see a lot of Firmware and Embedded Software Engineers with degrees in Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering. I do not really want to switch from Computer Science, but I really do want to work in those fields. What do you guys think? Is it possible with my desired major and minor? If you guys have any other advice, knowledge, or somewhere else I should post this, I'd love to hear.",3,1

This linked in with a question that had been on my mind for a while.

How do you perform a bitwise NOT operation with Addition?

So far this is the only way I have thought of:

Get some input and store it in RAM:
e.g. 1011
Then do the following:

    if input = 0000 then
        1111
    else
        do i=i+1 until input+i=1111
    end if

Though I think I've cheated a bit here because I'm not sure you can do an ""until"" without some sort of ""not"". It's almost like saying 

    while i+input  1111

, which implies some sort of NOT operation... Even if this would work it doesn't feel like a real NOT operation though... It feels like those people who ""hack websites"" with brute force...

So the question is - Can you do a Bitwise NOT operation with addition only?

**Edit: Oh man I'm an idiot.**

    For each bit in input
        bit=bit+1
        ignore MSB
    next bit",2,2

No successful programmer will be able to continually develop their craft if they are unable, or unwilling, to study topics on their own time. 

I graduated from Moravian College in 2012, with a Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience. Since graduating, I have studied an undergraduate degrees worth of computer science and programming courses. Using open courseware, such as coursera.com, Udemy.com, MIT Open Courseware, and other credible online sources, I have b uilt up my programming and computer science skills, while still continuing with my self-education in biological research. 

Georgia Techs online Masters program is a perfect fit for me. With coursework that capitalizes on topics I have studied, and projects that will help me hone my programming skills, I am very excited to continue learning in a more formalized setting! There is nothing I would more enjoy at this time in my life than to be with other students who are interested in the same program as I am, and be mentored by professors who are energetic about teaching in their field. I searched through a number of other online computer science programs, but I do not think their coursework affords me the skillset I would like to develop. Many programs are more focused on information technology and security, rather than providing a solid track in software engineering or computing. With the course offerings and value that Georgia Tech offers, it is truly my top choice in continuing my education. 

During the past two years, I have taught myself basic and advanced computer science concepts. Topics I studied include logic, algorithms, cryptography, data structures, databases, computer networks, operating systems, computer architecture, software engineering, and software debugging. I taught myself to program in the following computer languages: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and Java. Learning all of these topics on my own taught me better time management, dedication, and drive, while also teaching me where to find answers to questions I have. I had to seek out professionals that I knew in the software field, while also reaching out to strangers on online forums and various websites. In doing so, I have developed connections in the field I want to go into, while also being able to give back to communities that helped me when I was able to answer others questions. 

I completed an internship in software engineering, honing my programming skills and filling in any knowledge gaps I had. During the internship, I learned more about relational databases and SQL concepts when helping the other developers maintain their client database. I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop and maintain a software company website, as well as create web-based client documentation that was sold with the software. I learned to coordinate with a software development team and to I believe that having completed this internship has given me an even stronger foundation to do well in this Masters program. 

Collaborating with a neuroscience professor, I am creating SQL databases comparing genetic homologs between various organisms, including humans, dolphins, mice, and C. elegans. The goal of this project is to determine when and where organisms have diverged and converged evolutionarily, as a means of provide evolutionary genetic insight into the development of the brain. Having a masters in computer science would afford me more skills in being able to create not only better databases, but also understanding concepts underlying programs that could make more insightful comparisons, and perhaps providing other pieces of important information. 

During my career development, I have found myself being pulled in the direction of software engineering. My undergraduate degree in neuroscience has helped me in learning computer science by training me how to approach complex subjects in pieces, and learning how to learn. Eventually, I want to earn my PhD in computational neuroscience, so having a masters in computer science coupled with my undergraduate degree in neuroscience gives me the best foundation I can get before beginning my PhD program. 

In looking through the programs coursework, I recognize many topics that I have studied or have been exposed to. I am excited to take on the challenges of this program starting in Fall 2016. Having a Masters degree from Georgia Tech in computer science will afford me the extended skills and credibility that will make me more marketable when I begin seeking programming employment positions, and will also provide me a base in the event that I choose to continue my graduate education and earn a PhD in computational neuroscience.

I was hoping to get some career advice on what I need to do to achieve my goals for a computer science education. My goal (I think) is to achieve a PhD in Computer Science.  Heres my background. I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley where I double majored in Applied Math (with a focus in Statistics) and Economics. Afterwards, I did a Masters degree in Financial Engineering from UCLA. After that, I went to work for a finance company where I was a proprietary trader for 6 years. I am now 28 years old. I have ALWAYS had a passion for math since I was a little kid. As I got older, I developed a passion for finance (academically speaking. It was never about the money for me). So doing the Masters in Financial Engineering was a perfect fit for me, as it blended my two passions. Now, after 6 years, Ive realized how the tech industry has blossomed and is poised to take over finance. Recently, Ive become incredibly interested in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. It fascinates me, and I want to pursue some career that blends my loves of finance and math, and I think Computer Science is the missing key for me. 

My problem is I have no idea where to start. I know I want to obtain a PhD eventually, but is that too ambitious? Should I do a Masters first? I dont have much coding experience. Can I even apply for graduate programs? Do I need to go back and get a bachelors degree of some sort? How competitive of an applicant can I be? I would ideally like to go to a school in LA (Caltech or UCLA) or any top school obviously.  Does anyone have any advice on who I can contact and receive professional advice from? I would be willing to pay for any professional career guidance if that sort of stuff exists. 

Thank you for ANY and ALL considerations in taking the time to help me.

Just looking for advice.  For several years I had sat on the fence about whether I would want to pursue a Masters or PhD degree in Computer Science.  I received my undergraduate degree in 2012, so it's been a few years already, and at the time money was a large part of the deciding factor to start working rather than pursuing a degree (wedding, fiancee needs a couple surgeries, etc.).  A large number of the professors I had at the time have retired or moved on (to other institutions... I think they're mostly all living still...), and while I did grading/TA work for some of the professors or research projects with a couple other ones, I'm not sure how to proceed to in collecting recommendation letters for the application process.

Besides the logistical issues of tracking these people down, I'm not sure how I would approach them to get a letter of recommendation, as it's likely at this point that I didn't have enough interaction to be all that memorable to all but a couple of them.

Does anybody have any advice or experience about how someone can overcome this?  I was hoping that a Master's program wouldn't have as many requirements for the application process as PhD programs, but at least the ones that I'm looking at have similar requirements.  ",0,0

Anyway, the general idea is that the user makes an account, logs into the website, and takes a quiz.  From this quiz (which I would develop some sort of weighting system), they will find out what their result is (kind of like those personality quizzes, but I'll apply it to different topics). After the quiz there is a bunch of resources for them, including analytics and statistics about everyone else's results.  This would obviously update real time and dynamically. 

 I have experience with Java, and have a very good understanding of object oriented programming, recursion, and searching/sorting algorithms.  Basically I understand the typical programming concepts.  I also have basic understandings of html/css.  

Does anyone have any suggestions on where I should start? I understand that I need to have a language that does the backend work.  Is there any suggestions on which to use?

Of course, I am kind of scared as to what will occur of this and am in need of some guidance. 

The story goes like this. I was working on an assignment, and a friend messaged me saying that I needed to check my program on a different system. My school uses Raspberry Pi's to check compilation and functionality, so if it does not work on this system, then it is graded 0. I have gotten by without using these Pi's (by use of a virtual machine to code), until my last assignment which got me in trouble for it not working. Worried, I ask one of my friends if i can use their Pi to test compilation on their system. They agree, and I go over to their room to check. After fixing an error that cause my code to not work, I left the room, forgetting to actually delete my code from their system. Assignment submission comes up, and because of strict naming conventions that are used, my friend submitted my code instead of their own (mind you, they did write their own, original code). Since we both submitted the exact same code, we are now both being investigated.

My friend and I talked about this, and they have agreed to take the punishment fully, since they were the ones that did not make sure the code being submitted was the write one, but I do realize my error in not deleting my own code from the system.

TLDR: Accused of academic dishonesty, code didn't work on system it needed to, used friends system to fix, they submit my code accidentally since I didn't delete mine, and the strict naming conventions made it easy to. Please help if possible.

Edit: I should clarify that the friend who helped me get my code to compile is a different person from the one who told me to check the compilation in the first place.",5,7

Long Version: 
Hello, I'm currently in gr12, and have applied into engineering programs at a bunch of different universitites. Because my school does not offer gr12 physics I have to take the course online. My schoolboard has policy where online courses aren't sent with the other transcripts until the student is actually taking the course, so all the universities I applied to didn't consider me for early acceptance since I didn't have the physics requirement. Because of this, a couple of Universities sent me alternate offers for computer science, but I haven't really done any programming since I was in gr 7 and 8 (I learnt some basic C++, Java and Python as a hobby, enough to make some basic atari-like games), so I was wondering if there were any specific programming languages or concepts I should try to go over just in case I don't get accepted into engineering, and decide to accept the alternate offers. Thank you!

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have forgotten the large majority of what I knew back in grade 7&amp;8, so I would practically start from scratch.",2,3
