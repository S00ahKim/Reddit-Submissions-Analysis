The problem is all groups are pretty average and in fact there's a CGPA limit (no more than 3.7 by average) which makes it hard to think of doing anything special.

I've frequently been told that I should find a job, how I shouldn't wait so long after graduating or my degree will soon be invaluable.


The way I make my money is very unconventional but it is the product of hundreds of hours of my own programming. At this point it's nearly completely automated so I have to do maybe an hour of manual work every day. So far, I've made about $220,000 (CAD) since the start of last year. Unfortunately, I have little confidence in this whole thing lasting very much longer as I do rely on various things that I don't think will last. But I did say the same thing a year ago...


So I guess my questions are: Being fairly successful on my own, is it the wrong choice to continue doing what I'm doing and continuing to postpone finding a job? Am I screwing a future career for myself? Or will my success justify my blank resume to a future employer? The fact that I programmed something of value. Is this valuable at all? I know that in the tech world, younger people are favored when hiring so I'm worried I'm wasting away my prime years.

The thing is, since it's very automated, I could have a full time job and do this on the side but I really enjoy the freedom of it. I've spent a lot of time on improving myself, having struggled with depression and severe anxiety. And it's not like I'm completely wasting away my free time, I do spend a lot of it programming optimizations to my system and also just working on whatever I want. I have a few android apps I've created among other things. If I had a job, I would not have the time or motivation to do these things.

Hi! My name is Brandon and I am the developer and founder of Tweetak. Tweetak is a web application that connects Twitter users and small businesses for the opportunity to promote there brand on social media. 

How does it work?
Twitter users that we call ""Publishers"" receive requests from businesses on there dashboard where they can then review and Tweet out the proposed message on there Twitter page. If the publisher doesn't approve of the message they can deny the request and also send feedback to the the requester (Business Owner) on how there message can be improved. 

What makes Tweetak special?

* Category's
- Categories is the prize jewel of Tweetak. Most business are looking to promote themselves to an audience that is interested in the services they provide. That's why with Tweetak all Publishers are labeled with a chosen category that there Twitter page (and followers) most relate to. Giving businesses an easier way to find a Publishers that will promote their brand to their targeted audience.

* Guidelines 
- When a Publisher creates an account there are asked to submit 5 guidelines. Guidelines are rules to inform the prospective Requester of what content is permitted to be submitted as a request. This allows for less back and forth inquiries between the Publisher and Requester. 

* Publisher Fee
- As a Publisher, Tweetak allows you to set any amount of your choosing to charge requesters for their tweet. Once the publisher approves and tweets out the message on their Twitter page, they are accredited payment to there PayPal account instantly.

How can I become a Publisher?
As of today Tweetak is live and running on the web waiting for Twitter users to utilize this tool. As a NEW Website, Tweetak would need active Twitter account holders, to serve as Beta Users and test out the functionality of the site. Along with reporting any feedback back to Tweetak on how we can improve our website. Contact can be located on the top-right corner of the Publisher's dashboard page. In addition to having a Twitter account, Beta users would also need an active PayPal account to be able to receive payments.

 I had an interest in Data Science, hence the R from Coursera, and i've a one month internship in a big4 in their data &amp; analytics department. It was a small department, about 5 people (the building had about 500 hundred people, mostly auditors), and they used SAS so i was not able to help them and do something big enough. 

Anyway, i understood that my CS knowledge was lacking big time and i decided to do a masters degree. I want to do it distance learning because i dont want to live my country and i dont really like the programs they offer here. I found the Georgia Tech masters which seems legit and good but i dont know what i should do to accept me since i dont have a good enough programming background. I will choose their ML specialization which is mostly python and java as i have been told and i could do some MOOCs on them to be ready, but my background is still lacking and i might not get accepted for that.

I'm in my late 20's and have a career in filmmaking, but I'd like to pause everything and study computer science.
  
I don't have a degree (didn't need one for my field), and have horrible school grades. Basically I have nothing but time and determination. I'm self-learning now, but I'd like to take things up a notch with a structured curriculum, surrounded by like-minded people. 

I've looked into coding bootcamps but they don't have what I'm looking for. The only ones that are slightly attractive to me are the longer ones (6 months+), but even they don't touch on hardware at all and other cool stuff like: computer architecture, algorithms, operating systems etc.
  
Assuming the above, what would it take for me to get accepted as an undergraduate at a top CS university? If you could walk me through the motion that would be great. I don't mind studying math again (which I already am), doing side projects, passing exams etc. as a way to get to that point.

I was originally supposed to graduate in spring 2017 but many things set me back. Before coming to this university I took dual credit classes in high school, went to a community college, and went to another university. The whole time battling depression and I think I understand now ADD, though still undiagnosed. So my grades are not great. I hope if I work very hard I will graduate with a 3.4 from my university which is honors. I probably still won't have a 3.0 overall. I'm not even sure if I can do the 3.4 institutional GPA. It makes me feel like dog shit knowing I may have fucked up because in the end no excuse can change the fact that I did this to myself. I feel pressure to get a internship but scared my GPA is too low. I live in a pretty good area for CS because I'm in central Texas right in between San Antonio and Austin. I am also afraid that if I get an internship I can't afford it. I have been working in a restaurant kitchen for over a year, always working while going to school and feel like I have barely scraped by. I work 35 hours+ during the school year and sometimes 50+ when out of school. I just would like to hear if anyone has advice for me. I was really afraid to post this because I figured most of the responses will just be ""you dun goofed, nothing else to say"". So now I'm afraid all his time, hard work, struggling, and loans is worth nothing and I will be in a kitchen for the rest of my life.

tl;dr How do I make myself look good to potential employers when I have a not so great GPA. Right now 2.9 institution and 2.6 overall (Typing that out makes me cringe.) while working full time in an unrelated field?

I'm having a lot of trouble with a piece of programming homework. Any help you guys can give me would be amazing. Thanks in advance! 

Here's some background info first: Basically, we have to write a program that can convert zip codes to barcodes, and barcodes to zip codes. Zip codes are given in standard 5-digit format. There's a chart that shows what each digit 0-9 would look like as a barcode. For example, one is :::||. Each digit as a barcode is a combination of 3 :s and 2 |s. For the sake of space I'm going to refer to the combinations as ""bar digits.""

The total barcode is 32 symbols long. It stars with | and ends with | and has 6 bar digits. The first five correspond to the digits in the zip code. The last one is a checker. You add up all 5 digits in the zip code, and the checker is whatever number you need to add to the sum to make the sum a multiple of 10.

***END BACKGROUND INFO****

So for the assignment itself, we were given a tester class that we're not allowed to change. The tester only tests conversions from zip code to barcode, but the program we write has to be able to do both. The tester pretty much does 3 things: it takes a user input zip, it makes a new Zipcode with said input (code Zipcode = new Zipcode(zip)), and it gets the converted barcode with code.getBarcode().

But in the template Zipcode class, the only thing in the method getBarcode() is return barcode, and we aren't allowed to change that method. barcode is also a String instance variable, and we're not allowed to change that either. A TA gave a hint that we're supposed to call a method in the constructor so that barcode becomes the converted barcode, but I don't particularly understand what that means.

Also, in the test class, the user input is zip, but in the Zipcode class, the constructor is public Zipcode(int zip_number). How does that work? I don't understand how public Zipcode(int zip_number) will be able to get the user input if they aren't even named the same thing.

Also, we're supposed to have multiple constructors in order to convert from zip code to barcode and vice versa. I'm not clear on how to have multiple constructors and how to overload them properly. I feel like my brain's oozing out of my ears so I apologize if I've left out key information--please let me know in the comments!

Thanks again everyone!",4,2,False,self,,,,,

So, I'm considering the possiblity of seeking out a career that would want me to move around a lot, work in foreign cultures, etc. Unfortunately, I don't know if such a thing exists in the world of CS, because it's so much easier to just telecommute, and we don't have a lot of super location-dependent stuff, at least not for software.

Anyone know if there are exceptions to that, maybe some cross-discipline thing that requires both CS knowledge and field work?

I have designed a data structure for a small program of mine (nothing special) and I would like to know if the idea already exists and if yes what it's name is.

The datastructure is two arrays, each element containing a value and a pointer to an element in the other array. The corresponding element in the other array also contains a value and a pointer to the corresponding element in the first array.

Both arrays are sorted.

For example, we have the two arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[""foo"", ""quux"", ""zorb""]`, where 1 is linked to ""quux"", 2 is linked to ""zorb"" and 3 may be linked to ""foo"".

This would make it easy to find the key of a value/the value of a key via a binary search, which would
be much more efficient than linear search. On the other hand, insertion would have the complexity of the insertion of the underlying array structure.

Or maybe I'm not. Perhaps I found out what I really want to do and am trying to ease things up a bit for my college path. 

I'm taking Calculus 1 right now, and I can tell you I'm not having fun. Not that it's hard, Calculus 1 is pretty straightforward. Though, I'm not too fond of my professor or the textbook provided. It's very bad and I learn more from Khan Academy like usual.

For B.S Comp Sci &amp; Applied Math I must take Calc 3, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra (these are the three I can think of right now). But for B.A? The highest Calc you take is Calc 2, and then you take Discrete Probability and you're done.

I've always wanted to take Diff Equations and Calc 3 in the future, but I don't even know if it'll matter because all I want to do is program. Despite ""programming"" being not relatively the same as ""computer science"", I don't even know what else I would be doing if it wasn't programming.

I'm taking Intro to Comp Sci and we're learning Java. It's a breeze because I'm pretty much just reading the book and doing well on the projects. I'm also taking Discrete Math and I feel like this class is SO useless. People say it helps with Comp Sci, and yes I agree, but the way our professor teaches it is VERY useless.

It isn't one of those classes where you learn the concepts of it and end up remembering it or using it later on in the future. You'll forget all about it the moment you finish the class. 

Anyways, my main question is:

How ""Limited"" can I be if I don't have the math part and just have a B.A? I'm sure having a B.S with a high GPA beats anyone with only a B.A, does it not? Or having a B.A with a 4.0 could perhaps beat a B.S with &lt; 3.5? I don't know and I'm not trying to strictly compare GPAs, just speculating.",3,4,False,self,,,,,

*The goal of data integration is to align the schemas of disparate data sources so
that the data from these sources can be combined to provide users with a unified view of the
combined data. The users can access the combined data by making queries over a mediated
schema rather than making queries over the schemas of different data sources and then
combining the separate sets of query results together. A data integration system will answer a
query over the mediated schema with a set of automatically combined query results. The aim
of this project is to explore the state of the art techniques and to implement a working
prototype for data integration with the appropriate techniques.*

We have [A] bits used for page offset, [B] bits used for virtual page number and [C] bits for physical page number. Assume a fully associative TLB with 4 lines. For parallel tag comparison we need [D] comparators, each [E] bits wide. The total tag memory requirement is [F] bits (this is the total number of tag-bits in the TLB). 
 
Memory access can be improved using a cache. Assume 1 GByte RAM, the address bus is [G] bits and the memory is byte-addressed (i.e. an address points to a byte). We have 16 kByte data cache (first level cache). Each cache line holds 4 data words (each word is 4 bytes). Our cache has [H] lines. The address bits [I]..0 give line offset.  
 
Assume the cache to be direct mapped. The address bits [J]..[K] are used as cache tag, the address bits [L]..[M] point to a cache line. In the cache we will need [N] k-bit memory for the tag fields. For tag comparison we need  [O] comparator(s), each [P] bits wide.

So, I've always been really good at medical science and it always came easy to me. Ao I planned to become a nurse because it was something that I could do without it posing much of a challenge for me. I did a year of college and being in the course, i got great grades but started thinking if it was something I'd be able to do everyday as a career and I don't think it is.

I spend 100% of my time on my conputer. I love soing outdoor things etc etc, but at the end of the day, I love being on the computer and being on one seems to relieve stress and get me through the day.  Then someone mentioned CS.

I always had an interest in computers and programming but no one to really go to about it. ( I live in a small town and the highest computer lessons we had were typing and making a web page out of html once lol.) I've coded a few tumblr themes but that's not much to show. Im not bad math but I'm scared of it at higher levels; however something is just pulling me toward CS since it was mentioned to me.

So I'm curious...
What kind of jobs do you guys do with your degree and the difficulty? Do you love it or is there some other career you'd rather do? Is there anyone that isn't ""math-minded"" but still found a way to do CS and enjoy it? ",12,20,False,self,,,,,

So a little background story: 

I got my AA degree at the local community college next to my university in order to save money on tuition. I graduated from there this summer with only a basic introduction to C++, and no outside knowledge of any other language. I am now a junior at the university and am only enrolled in a more advanced C++ class and a basic UNIX class while i finish up the rest of the unrelated degree requirements I have to take. So the problem I am now faced with is: How can I quickly get up to speed with everyone else? It seems to me that everyone else who is at my level of advancement in the degree (only three semesters left, YIKES) are already taking internships, working on open source projects, etc. I don't think I am anywhere near the level of where I can be working on open source stuff, and don't think any companies would be interested in hiring an intern with nothing but a modest knowledge of C++. This concerns me because by the time I feel that I'll be able to participate in these resum building activities, it will be time to look for a job/grad school! Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated.",0,6,False,self,,,,,
