I plan to major in computer science and possibly double major in history. I'm currently a junior but college application time is just around the corner. Anyway, I'm kind of nervous because I've heard that computer science is competitive: there are students who have been writing code for years. I can't write a single line of code or haven't taken any classes because they are not offered at my school. I'm looking into getting help, maybe Khan Academy. So my questions are:

Will you really have a terrible time in computer science if you have zero experience?
Is computer science really that hard? Manageable? 
How's the course load?
How was your computer science experience?

Specifically abuse complaints.,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/22fyyu/using_perl_how_can_one_build_a_system_that_learns/,DamagedFreight,1396893670,"Hello,

I'm working for a major hosting provider's abuse department and I have a system that looks for certain keywords and classifies an abuse complaint as a particular category (like ""Spam Complaint"", ""Malware Complaint"", ""Illegal Content Complaint"" etc.)  I'm wondering how I can do this without using keywords and actually feed text with known classifications and have it learn without pre-defined keywords.  

The goal here is to better classify things like ""Spam Complaint"" as intentional spam for marketing purposes or an infection causing spam (ie. spam distributing malware) and better classify things like ""Network Abuse Complaint"" into more specific sub-classifications like ""Brute Force Attacks"" without defining every single keyword on the planet and deal with competing keywords that might be mentioned more often but are not necessarily more to do with the classification of the complaint.

I would guess it'd be something like a bayes database but I don't know if that's the right terminology.

If anyone has any ideas I'd love to hear them.  I'm limited to using perl here but I can do fairly advanced perl scripting.

Well ok like 75% pointless..

IF this is the type of stuff i'm going to be doing when I get a job, I will hate my life for the next 60 years.

I want to get into game programming or antivirus. Something either graphicsy or pretty low level reverse engineering/assembly like antivirus or something. I can deal with other stuff like databases and just random c#, c++ and c stuff. but those are the two fields I strongly prefer.

One of my classes demands I learn Haskell. are you kidding me? The class is called PRogramming Fundamentals and we're learning haskell...

Why don't classes just teach things in a straightforward manner... like telling us about scope, and other programming fundamentals (maybe making us learn certain keywords like inline, volatile, extern, etc...)

I just hate that the CS curriculum seems to be largely pointless. There are only a few classes I feel that are very useful, and then the rest are minimally useful, if at all.

Just my $0.02... wondering what other fellow college brahs think about the curriculum at their college.",13,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm afraid that by the time I graduate, I would not know enough to be able to get a decent job, or even an internship for that matter. 

This entire summer, I'll be mainly just working a summer job and trying to improve myself as a CS student. What can I do this summer to make sure that I become more competent as a programmer and acquire an internship this Junior year?
