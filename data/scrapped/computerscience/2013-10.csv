Is it true that the same Linux kernel is used across all Linux distributions? Is this same kernel used on Android devices too? 


Why is writing a kernel such a difficult task that Linus Torvalds received so much credit for Linux?


How is the Linux kernel still being developed? Like what else is there to do? 


Can you explain how an operating system is different from a kernel? Like why can't you run an operating system directly on top of BIOS?

I am currently a freshman in college majoring in Public Relations and minoring in Computer Science.

I, like most of you, love technology and follow it religiously.

My dream is to work for a startup company in New York or San Francisco. I don't care how narrow-minded that may sound. It's been my dream for a long time.

I've had some experience with HTML and CSS, but that's about it.

I am not so good at math. This alone has kept me from majoring in CS because the major requires Calculus and Physics.

Anyway, I just wanted to hear from those of you in the engineering/software development field and your experiences.

Also, how are job prospects for this major?

Thanks guys!",2,1,False,default,,,,,
