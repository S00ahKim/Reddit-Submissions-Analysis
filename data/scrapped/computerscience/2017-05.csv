Consider a single machine that can process jobs. We receive a set of job requests {1,2,....n}, and the ith request takes a positive time duration ai to process. We are able to use the machine for the period between time 0 and specied time t. Our goal is to process the jobs so as to keep the machine busy for the entire time it is available. Give an efficient algorithm to determine whether the machine can be kept busy for the entire time t, and which jobs should be processed. You may assume the processing times ai and total available time t are positive integers. Also, state and justify the running time of your algorithm.

Where do I start ? 
Should I consider study at a university or a polytechnic ? What courses /papers should I look into if I decide to go into it ?

However, after being here for a few months, there is a concern I would like some advice on. 

The issue is that there is absolutely no programming required for this position, in a nutshell,  I only validate text files in a very old, rigid and convoluted system (I do use some basic bash scripting). 

After wording my concerns, I was re-assured that they don't intend to keep people in this position for too long (only around a year) and I will be able to move into other projects afterward.

So from my point of view, it seems that this is just how the industry moves, for the most part, I'm a Junior fresh out of college so I have to do some grunt work before being able to move into more interesting work later on, even though this work will not give me almost any valuable experience and I will have to go out of my way in order to maintain and learn new  programming skills. 

Also, if I ever get moved to something else, it will be to something the company *needs*, not something I *want* of course, I could very well end up in the same situation again (although, there are some interesting projects in the company, that I would like to be a part of).

So for you guys that have more experience than me in the industry, have you been in a situation similar to mine? In hindsight 20/20 do you think it's worth it to grind this kind of position and hope you find yourself in a more interesting position later on? Or should I be more assertive in my search for a more ideal job? Maybe I'm just too impatient and should stop asking so many questions? 

Would appreciate some much-needed wisdom here. Thank you in advance for any advice/experience you can provide :)

This needs to give us zero. If we do 3768172-(37681.72*100) we get zero as expected but just simply replacing the 2 with a 7 causes a problem.
Putting the above calculation into excel or even wolfram alpha give us 4.656612873077393*^-10 .

I am about to start my last, senior, year of Chemical Engineering, and I have come to realize that Chemical Engineering is not what I want to do in my life. During the junior year, I was in search of internships and trying to learn as much as I can about the industry. I attended many lectures given by people with years of professional experience in Chemical Engineering, listened to their success stories, their struggles and overall experience. Also, I went for a field trip to a local company's facility located one and half hour away from the city. By the end of the Spring Semester, a thought of whether I made a right choice for my major started coming to my mind quite often. I cannot imagine myself working as a Chemical Engineer all my life. Spending days away from my family, dedicating my life to work. I want a different lifestyle. Of course, if I actually enjoyed this type of work, I would not mind, however, I don't. I enjoyed chemistry and math when I was in highschool, but Chemical Engineering occurred to be something completely different than I imagined. 
This year, I started learning Python out of curiosity, and it got me hooked. In addition, I took a course in MatLab, which was a requirement for my major, and I could easily spend my Friday and Saturday working on assignments, trying to make them as neatly as I can. I enjoyed it. I think I am going to get Master's in Computer Science, so I could get a job in it later. Right now, I have 1 year of Python behind me with some basic knowledge of HTML, XML, JSON, SQLite; MatLab. I am planning on learning C++ and Java just to get a more well-rounded skillset, as I have noticed that these two languages are quite common in job requirements, then I will dedicate my time to specialize in a couple of them. I am thinking about picking a minor, but it's unlikely because I have only a year left in my major, even if I stay in college to take summer courses. 
What do you think of my idea? Any useful advices would be appreciated. Thank you.
P.S. I know that I will be behind students who actually majored in Computer Science. However, I am ready to learn and dedicate my time to transition to Computer Science. For me, it's a small trade-off, when I think about doing something that I would enjoy.",9,5

Those computers were pretty pricey, the first Cray-1 sold to a customer was almost $8 million (including $1 million for disks).

I read somewhere when they were filming Tron, the display that was attached to film camera was capable of something like 4000x4000 resolution (not sure if this is right, not a 4:3 ratio but I'd imagine top and bottom were left blank to get film widescreen format so maybe half of the display's max resolution??) but rendering the scene was still slow. Something like 1 line at a time because 8MB memory still wasn't enough for a full frame render.

I also heard that iPhone 5s were nearly 1000x more powerful than Cray-1 so hypothetically if someon+e were able to access the original 3D data and import/convert them to modern 3D rendering software on a basic run-of-the-mill desktop computer with good graphic cards like NVidia 1080 or RX480, and connected to a 4k display can Tron CGI be rendered in real time?",2,6

Problem is, I'm not that good at it. I know it's going to take a ton of practice, but I'm feeling so discouraged. I made a C in my first programming class, and I'll make either an A or B for this past semester. I know grades don't really mean much if you don't know how to code. 

My plan is to work really hard this summer and practice Java and C, also to prepare for Data Structures next semester. I really want this to work out because I actually enjoy coding. I just don't know that much about it so far. 

One problem that I need to work on is logic. Actually figuring out 'Okay I need this to do that', that sort of thing. But my friend says that comes with practice. 

I guess my question is, if you didn't do extremely well in college or you're just kind of mediocre at coding, did you still turn out okay? Were you still able to get a job?

I'm working on a personal project right now that related to film and I'm having to deal with frame timing and whatnot and I've been running into a little bit of an issue with how to efficiently store and sort my frames into a one dimensional structure (a.k.a. a ""Film Reel"").  Specifically, I work with Animation where I might want to hold an image for a few frames, so let's say that we have this data structure:

Frame:

 - number: positive integer; must be unique in the reel.  It's the starting time of this Frame
 - hold: positive integer.  How many frames of time to hold the image for.
 - image: what to display.  Could be nothing (e.g. an empty Frame)



So for example, If I were working with footage at 24 FPS, but wanted to hold each image for 2 frames (a.k.a. known as ""animating on twos"").  My Reel structure would look like this:

```
|1_|3_|5_|7_|9_|11_|...
```

Or I could have something more crazy like this, where the hold pattern is [4, 6, 2]:

```
|1___|5_____|11_|...
```


The problem is when I want to insert or remove any new frames.  If it was at the end of the Reel, it would be no problem, but say I wanted a new frame at position 2 with a hold of 4.  I would have to shift down everything to the right.  What if I want to know which frame is at timing position 10?

Does anyone know of any good data structures or algorithms to sort data like this, and do the lookups in a reasonable amount of time?

Background: Graduated with BBA (Bachelors Business Admin.) in Information Technology Management in 2013 (Uni. currently ranked #15 by US News, and 3.4-3.5 GPA fwiw). 
Worked for Big 4 Advisory for 3 years, and now I'm working for the internal consulting office of a Taiwanese Conglomerate in Taipei (~6 months now).

Long story short, I'd like to deepen my technical knowledge and have been thinking about going back to school. On the one hand I think my resume is reasonably strong, but since I don't have an STEM degree it's discouraging to see that I'm not qualified for most masters. 

I stumbled across this program at University of British Columbia: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/programs/second-degree 
which appears to be perfect for someone in my situation, but another bachelors is unappealing (could be my silly bias). Another option is taking supplemental math and CS classes at a Taipei university at night, and apply to Masters programs once I've plugged the holes in my education. And of course the last option is fuck school and self teach myself.

At the end of the day I want to learn more and get a new career. 

Old job was risk consulting for banks...fuck that. My current job involves some data analysis, and web development, but also a lot of design work. Been self-studying programming, which has been great, but also think it would be nice to be able to focus on CS solely in school. Current job is good, but pay in Taipei is notoriously low (another topic altogether).

Sorry in advance if my post is not proper, I'll delete it immediately. I should also say I am also not a native English speaker so maybe I am not articulate. My sentences might be unnatural, if you cannot understand what I mean please let me know :)

Anyway, I know it's a very vague question, but I just wonder how can I carry on long/deep conversations with engineers?(Espcially computer/software engineers. To be honest I don't know the exact differences between many engineering fields.)


I am from South Korea and it seems like many engineers visit South Korea or other East Asian countries like Japan, China for work(and fun?)
Recently I met some engineers from foreign countries(Most of them are from America) and had to work with them. Civil engineers, computer engineers, software engineers etc. I found it difficult to have a long/deep conversation with them because of language barriers and my ignorance of their field. I had many questions, they tried to explain what they do but I couldn't understand what they said and we really couldn't find any common interests. :(  


Well, I wanted to talk about the baduk(go) match between Lee sedol vs AlphaGo since I like baduk and it's something I know(very Asian). The thing is I didn't know how AI works and couldn't understand some academic English terms used in computer science fields so the conversation didn't go well.


Anyway, before I worked with them I was not interested in any engneering fields at all knowing nothing. But after I meet some engineers and work with them, now I think it would be good to know really basic things to carry on a better conversation, especially about computer/software engineering + very simple mathmatics. I found those fields very interesting but I just don't know how to approach them. Maybe I should start learning math at first? 
Since I often work with foreigners(mainly Americans) I thought it can be helpful to read books written in English. Can It be helpful to read some books? Are there any good books for beginners? I looked up some courses in ""Coursera"" and ""Uda city"" but everything seems so very professional, don't know how to set up my plans.

I've taken 2 AP CS classes, one being straight up CS and the second focusing on the principles behind it, and I love the subject. I like programming, although it does get boring and tedious after a few hours, but I love learning about computers and how they work mathematically. My college is going to require me to take up to Calc 3, discreet math, etc.

I love math. I love the concepts of math and finding things out in a logical way. But math classes and tests constantly bend me over. The concepts are easy for me; it's when I get asked to use the concepts in rapid succession on tests that I get mixed up. I can't remember ever getting over a 90 on two math tests in a row. If I get less than a 69.4 on my final, I'll fail calc for the year and have to take summer classes to get my diploma. But that's not even my biggest problem right now.

So does anyone have any advice that will help me do better in college? Some college students have told me that college will be better for me, but all my teachers have told me that it will be worse.",16,7

 What is the difference between computer science vs computer engineering? I'm assuming computer engineering is a subcategory of computer science, but am curious as to what the major differences are.

Is computer science/computer engineering hard to get a grasp of? (I know this depends on the person, but am curious for a general idea.)

How many years of college am I looking at if I were to go through with this and what classes would I be taking if so?

What would I expect after graduating college with such a degree?

Is an online course a good idea or not? I don't really live near a college and can't afford housing near one, but am willing to go into debt if online college is a bad idea.

Is the money there/worth it?

And are there job opportunities or internships while in the middle of college courses for Computer Engineering.

So recently I noticed this open source online password manager called Bitwarden. So far I liked it and after talking to some people, I was told consistently that since LastPass is closed source, you can't tell if LastPass incorporated some kind of malicious functionality like a backdoor into the code.

A developer of Bitwarden told me that since Bitwarden is open source, people can see if there is malicious functionality in the source code and therefore it is not feasible to develop the software if there is malicious functionality. I thought that since LastPass is proprietary, how can I trust them that they didn't include a backdoor as part of the PRISM program.

However, the LastPass site claims that the company (LastPass) does not participate in the PRISM program and that they utilize various security methods.

I just want some feedback on whether my concerns are valid and if an open source program is more trustworthy than it's proprietary counterpart.

Also I would like to know if open sourcing a password manager is really necessary to improve overall security. Thank you.",4,9

- I am pretty well disciplined, and have taught been successful self teaching, before.

- I have a good background in math's fundamentals and logical studies.

- I am mainly interested in learning about program code (website, apps, etc), networking/internet, and network security/privacy - (i.e. I want to learn as much CS, but currently, these things are much more practically important for me than say hardware engineering, Turing machines, more abstract problems, etc).
I am looking for resources, sites, guides to learn from, and just a general direction. I realize that I can't exactly get a full course plan online (I guess that's what you pay for at university), but I am hoping for a good place to start, and some resources. I have already grasped some of the basics, but it is important that I get them all. Also, it is good, for me, to start with simple versions of the concept, but then ramp up the intensity/complexity of lessons pretty quickly, as I tend to catch on quicker than most, and something that putzes along will end up costing me a lot of unnecessary time.

The worst part is that I tried to clear this one of my friend and she said that nobody cares what it is called. 


Besides this, everyone's afraid of JavaScript and thinks that it's difficult. We also have HTML in our curriculum and everyone prefers it. I'm the only one who would gladly take JavaScript over HTML anyday. I know both the languages well but I'm more proficient in JavaScript. I was really frustrated when in our final practical exam, there was no question from JavaScript; only from HTML. 


All this has really made me think a lot about continuing with computer as my minor next year. I have to drop one; and it's either this or physics.

The worst part is that they get their way with the teacher. They even managed to cut out the CSS practicals (another thing that I really like and am good at). 


Maybe I'm overreacting. The thing is that I do want to continue with these languages but not as a part of my course. There must be alternatives; I could use some suggestions.

These two options is something that is confusing me. I've been offered admission into a master's electrical engineering program for augmented reality(object classification).

Coming from a computer Science Background I'm not sure if I'll be able to pull this off easily. 

The other option I have is to apply for entry-level jobs, and later do part time courses or schooling in data science or deep learning if things go positively.

I'm not honestly sure which to choose.  Each decision has its own risks and rewards. Has anyone here been put into this situation? Any advice would be great.

I'm trying to implement DHT using Kademlia. https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf

In the paper, the nodes are on a sort of bitwise compressed trie. Meaning that a node with ID 110111... will be at position 110 if there is no other node that is 110. In this same example, this node sees every subtree that it doesn't belong to, namely: 0, 10, 111. 

From what I understand, a node has a list of ""k-buckets"" which are a list of nodes, their ip addresses, and udp port. Since this node is at 110, it has 3 k-buckets for each of the subtrees. Each kbucket is a queue storing the most recently alive node from its corresponding subtree.

This is where I'm not sure. The node lookup is a recursive method that looks up a number, alpha, of nodes at the kbucket, determined by XOR itself and target address. Suppose we want the k nodes closest to 101110... from 110. XOR first 3 bits is 011. So then it looks at the second kbucket since that is the first bit that is different. The nodes at 01... then look for 011... and send those back. Keep going until we run out. The resulting list of k nodes is a queue of all the nodes that our node send a query to. Because there could be more than k responses and early responses are less accurate, take the last k responses. Is my understanding correct?

Furthermore, it is unclear to me how storing value is determined. In the paper, it says to take the k closes nodes to yourself and then tell these nodes to hold a copy of your value. Can anyone elaborate on this? And also caching?

Thank you.",0,4

Hey there everyone, so I'm computer science major going on my second year in college and I was looking for a desktop that could last me the longest,  under 200 USD, and handle the programming and compiling as a breeze for as long as possible (if I can build one better please let me know). My Thinkpad T430 (i5, 4 GB) have been handling the load OK but once I started using IDEs it's been slowing down on those tasks (this probably could be fixed by more ram and/or an ssd) so I thought why not get a desktop (the one I have now is a Dell optiplex 745 SFF, core 2 duo, 8GB DDR2) since I was planning to get one in the future for that and emulation. So I was looking for a prebuilt or to build one where I could do both VGA and HDMI (for the two monitors I have) and has an upgrade path overhead where I can add dedicated graphics and more ram later. That being said, was this the best I could have done with what's out there? A Dell Vostro 470 (OS identifies it as Precision T1700), i5-3450, 8GB DDR3 (2 x 4GB, 2 slots left, max 32GB), 1 TB of storage (2 x 500GB drives) for 169 USD.
Thanks everyone and have a good rest of your lives!

TL;DR: Need system under 200 USD and lasts as long as possible doing COMPSCI.",6,2

I don't even own a computer. I've lived in a pretty loose world my whole life, and have always subconsciously thought of myself as 'dumb'- hence I never put much effort into my education. I've been learning over the last few years however, that my brain may not be as bad as I've been accusing it. I know I'm super thirsty for knowledge, and I have great analytical skills, which I assume is probably quite beneficial to understanding the world of computers. Since using Reddit, I often see articles about tech / computer science stuff and even tho it goes way over my head, I find it super captivating, I feel really compelled to know more. 
So I'm wondering, how does someone with NO (I really mean it) knowledge or understanding of computers begin to learn the very, absolute basics? Seeking out this info has only seemed to provide me with stuff that's sort of irrelevant or oversimplified, i.e. pages on 'how to use Microsoft word!!'

However I am finding some major silver linings to the decision and choice(s) I have made this far in school. 

I have recently been looking into technical writing specifically in the software development fields as well as in the curriculum development fields for technical training. This is my number one interest right now. 

As well I have looked into some IT type work positions as well. Also I have looked into Cisco Certifications(CCNA,CCIE,etc) which I have been told can actually be used to get jobs of high caliber without even needing a college degree. This is where my technical competencies and interests seem to be most concentrated. 

With all of this being said, does anyone in either of these fields have some advise?
I am most interested in Technical writing as for a short time I spent my college career pursuing an English degree but then later changed back to CS for some possibly understood reason. However I am a diverse person with many interests. 
Is there some other field that I may should look into using my degree in? Being a math and logic heavy field I know it's applicable in many domains. 
Or does anyone just have some general advise? I'm a sucker for some relevant wisdom from those on the other side of the yard(out of college). 

Thanks to anyone who looked at this and made it to this point.

Ive seen things like raspberry pi machines networked to a bunch of stuff that were able to open doors and stuff or tell the time based off someone playing Zelda songs on an ocarina.

its gotta be plausible to make a little device that has similar features, and maybe sell that device on kickstarter, based around a customized raspberry pi or something.

but before the hardware implementations, software would be key -- id be willing to use C/C++ to try to write my own software for it --

my question is what kinds of functionality does it have? is it possible for me to like, have it take voice commands and go on the internet to use openly available resources to accomplish the same tasks generally?

even if it has far less features, the software being open source would be its key feature. Yes -- anyone who uses a PC with a microphone is going to pay nothing for it -- but people who wanted a similar stand alone device would still buy it.

there could be far greater user-confidence in security with the device, as the code is there for any and all to see and or change to their liking, and even to redistribute that code -- enabling users themselves to expand the feature sets on existing devices.",7,0

It seems difficult to get in to a masters program with no prior CS coursework (probably rightfully so!)

I'm thinking about undertaking units from a grad cert in CS as a non-degree student, then transitioning to grad cert (or Georgia Tech if I can get in!), then masters. 

Ideally I want to complete everything within 2 years at a decent university, and at a cost of &lt;$25000, with a formal degree at the end of it (so not just self study and online courses)

Options I'm looking at 

&amp;nbsp;

**Georgia Tech**  &amp;nbsp;

Online MSCS &amp;nbsp;

$7000 &amp;nbsp;

Looks perfect! But difficult to get in and requires prerequisites 

&amp;nbsp;

**UMass Dartmouth** 

Prep course (maybe) &amp;nbsp;

Grad Cert &amp;nbsp;

Masters CS &amp;nbsp; 

About $25000 total

&amp;nbsp;


**University of Illinois** &amp;nbsp;

Grad Cert &amp;nbsp;

Masters CS &amp;nbsp;

(most expensive, likely to come to &gt;$30000, but seems to be strong in AI/ML) &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Does this plan of non-degree units to grad cert to MSCS seem reasonable? Can anyone suggest a better way of going about this?**

I understand how Savitch's algorithm works but I dont understand one thing. To use his algorithm we need the initial state and the accept state. How are we supposed to find all accepted states (once at a time) without using much space? Dont we need to save the machine configuration to know which accept states we already found and tried out? That would take a space of O(ntime(n)) and this can be way larger than nspace^2(n)

I had an idea for a program to make that I know would be useful to some people I know and just wanted to attempt it as a side project. It involves recognising a certain phrase. I need help in ways in which I could implement it.

I'm a student and have only ever done programming in Java and am due to start University next year so don't know much but what I'm thinking is I think something along the lines of machine learning.  For example, if I wanted a program to add one to a counter each time the word 'the' is said in a sentence, how would I be able to go about doing this in Java? 

Can anyone give me any ideas or even just guide me somehow I'm just not too sure where to start.

The reason I am questioning that decision is because I have heard from multiple reliable sources that computer science is so critical to theoretical and particle physics that it would be better to major in mathematical physics and minor in computer science. The problem with that is that my high school never offered any programming or computer classes, so I'm afraid I will be really far behind. Do you think enough skils transfer from math to computers that I will be fine, or do I maybe need to take a summer class or something to catch up?

Hi, so I'm doing some homework for a CS class, and I need a little help.

Consider the following

    class temporary 
    { 
    public: 
    void set(string, double, double); 
    void print(); 
    double manipulate(); 
    void get(string&amp;, double&amp;, double&amp;); 
    void setDescription(string); 
    void setFirst(double); 
    void setSecond(double); 
    string getDescription() const; 
    double getFirst()const; 
    double getSecond()const;
    temporary(string = """", double = 0.0, double = 0.0);
    private: 
    string description; 
    double first; 
    double second; 
    };

What I need to do is 
&gt;Write the definition of the member function manipulate that returns a decimal number as follows: If the value of description is ""rectangle"", it returns first * second; if the value of description is ""circle"", it returns the area of the circle with radius first; if the value of description is ""sphere"", it returns the volume of the sphere with radius first; if the value of description is ""cylinder"", it returns the volume of the cylinder with radius first and height second; otherwise, it returns the value -1.

What I have so far for that is 

    double temporary::manipulate()
    {
    if (description == rectangle)
    {
    return (first * second);
    }
    else if (description == circle)
    {
    return (area of the circle with the radius first);
    }
    else if (description == sphere)
    {
    return (volume of the sphere with radius first);
    }
    else if (description == cylinder)
    {
    return (volume of cylinder with radius first, height second);
    }
    else
    {
    return -1;
    }
    }

I think I have the right idea, but I'm not sure how to actually do the return part, where it gives back the area or volume.
I'm not looking for an answer per say, but really where should I go past the psudo-code? Am I even thinking about this the right way?",3,2
