Due to this, I'm planning to start a computer science club that will NOT involve programming, but just the more mathy/theoretical aspects of CS. I want to appeal to the students who are science/math inclined but have no programming interests, and to teach them that CS is to programming as biology is to medicine.

I would love if you guys could help me come up with plans for CS lessons that don't explicitly relate to programming. Here are some that I have so far:

* Search and sort algorithms/dealing with big data

* Cryptography and encryption

* Artificial intelligence (don't know much about this but it seems like a really interesting topic)

So any topic that pops into your head would be super appreciated. Extra points for lessons that relate to real-world situations/issues (something like NSA maybe?). Don't hesitate to throw anything out there!

Also one last thing: as a hook to attract people to my table at the club fair, do you guys know anything physical I could build that demonstrates some CS or hardware concept?

I think it pairs nicely with the OOP course I'm taking, in that you have these clear-cut layers providing services to those above it and using services from those below. To complicate things even more, you've got a wide range of different protocols that need to work agnostically of each other, and then be able to handle new ones in the future.

One thing that peaked my interest was the fact that throughout networking's history there are amazing examples of thinkers solving problems with unique solutions. One example I love is tunneling to facilitate the switch from IPv4 to IPv6. You've got this new IP version that you need to switch to before you run out of address space, and shutting down every node in the world to upgrade it to IPv6 just isn't an option. What do you do? You encapsulate IPv6 datagrams in IPv4 ones and use old nodes to transfer your sneaky IPv6 datagram until you reach an IPv6 capable node. There are many more examples, this was just the most recent one that came to my mind.

Now that I've found out how much I enjoy networking, I'm going to do as much as I can to develop side-projects that work with multiple end-users interacting with each other.

Have any of you found topics within CS that really sparked your passion? And if you enjoy networking too, talk to me about it!

I'd be interested to hear about your situation and if you have found happiness in computer science. 

I'll first start with where I'm at currently. I'm a sophomore at a public university in the mid-west studying computer science with a focus on security. My grades are good and I'm an intern at a fairly large company doing very low-level enterprise-level IT tasks. I also tutor computer programming a couple days a week at the school I go to. Considering these jobs plus classes, it's quite a lot of work.

Now, how did I get here? When I started to pursue computer science a few years ago, I set out to really learn as much as I could. I started with programming and have since expanded to many other computer science topics like design, operating systems, etc. I have really learned a lot about IT as it relates to business but also have an intrigue into what is to come with more advanced computer science topics. Through all of this, I never found something that has fulfilled me. That feeling you get from a day well spent from accomplishing something meaningful has never been felt. Each night I double-down and say ""tomorrow is the day when I will be fulfilled"" only to be disappointed by idiot students that come in for tutoring or one of my fellow desk jockeys at work. 

One of the reasons I think this is, is because my time has not been allocated to the best of my ability. Sacrificing regular social interaction for more work and more classes has not paid off. Moreover, cramming my day with mind-numbing work leaves me mentally exhausted at the end and wanting to be alone. My mind is very scattered at times and doesn't quite have the time to relish what exactly I am doing with my life. It's the feeling of ""going very fast, but going nowhere"". It's almost to the point where I can't sleep or eat. I literally have dreams where I am trying to solve a problem and get stuck in an infinite for loop. Maybe it's my bladder signalling that unless I go to the bathroom, I can't proceed with the dream, who knows. I also find myself eating abnormally, eating large meals, skipping meals, etc. Even with a roommate, living has really gone downhill. 

So what does this mean for the future? Without finding other like-minded people --especially in the computer science field-- the path seems short and dry. But, by taking on a new project, meeting new people, bouncing a few ideas around, I think I can experience the path of computer science which is long and fruitful.

Is this on par? How have you found fulfillment in this field?",2,6,False,self,,,,,

I started out, and still am working as a 3D artist but always had a niggling feeling that the technical side was what truly interested me more than the art. So I started a mathematics (Closest subject available, and I just love math) undergrad degree part time and just completed it this year.

Now I can't afford to go any further in formal education so I'm looking on advice for the next step, what books to read, what subjects to study, etc.

The kind of work done by the Interactive Geometry Lab at ETH (http://igl.ethz.ch/) probably best summarizes what kind of work I want to do; mesh processing, shape analysis, image analysis. I've dabbled in all of these informally but never applied a proper mathematical framework. What should I look at? What's a good roadmap for what an average MSc would consist of?

On top of that I could really do with a good 'bible' on more basic graphics algorithms to help fill in the gaps and use as reference. That would probably be the most helpful right now.

I graduated in December 2012 from ASU with a BS in Graphic Information Technology, where I focused in Graphic Design and 3D Modeling/Animation. After working full-time as a graphic designer for several years, I decided that I didn't really enjoy the work anymore and the industry was so competitive that finding a more senior-level job that paid better was dismal. Outlook in my market was pretty poor... so when I was given a chance to become a front-end developer for the company, I jumped at it.

Since then, I've decided that I LOVE programming. I'd taken several web courses in school but the teachers didn't really present it in an exciting way and I hated it. Working on real-world projects and being able to learn new things every day makes me excited to go to work every day. I really want to further my education and be able to move up in the software world - I enjoy web development, but I don't think it's ultimately where I want to be.

I've really been looking into degree programs lately and, naturally, Computer Science has piqued my interest. Several of my friends who I know in software assure me that I don't need a degree to do it and I can learn everything myself (including one who is a senior software engineer for American Airlines and is on the hiring committee for his department)... but I'd really rather have a formal training with some structure - plus, I always enjoyed college and just enjoy learning, period.

My biggest hesitation, however, is that I honestly have no interest in ""computer science"" as a career choice. I guess AI and Robotics would be interesting, but things like Big Data, research and academia-related topics don't really excite me, though I'm sure I'd find topics throughout the coursework that I had no idea about that will. From what I've researched, the ""software engineering"" topics are of far more interest to me, but not as many universities seem to offer software engineering undergrad programs and, if they do, they curriculum is nearly identical to their CS degrees.

I've also heard from a lot of people that many CS degrees focus heavily on theoretical concepts and graduates come out with very little real-world experience and projects under their belts. This concerns me - I don't want a theoretical education, I want a practical one. Honestly, I just want to program cool things that will solve problems that a significant amount of people will actually use.

So, I have a well-defined problem that I don't really know where to start with. Long story short, for a meeting, I need to assign people to event tables. To elaborate:

- There is a number of events that may be held during the day, depending on the demand.
- Each event  accepts a minimum and maximum (variable between events) number of people. This list is published in advance to attendees.  
- Each guest then picks and ranks five events that they want to go. Since all events are simultaneous, they can only end up in one.
- Each guest **must** be placed in an event. Events may be cancelled to maximize ""happiness"".
- The goal is to pour the registration data into the algorithm, and the algorithm telling me where to assign people.

From the last five years' data, we usually have around 200-250 people attending. Experience says that the data is well-structured (e.g. no 200 people massing to five events with 20 seats open). Usually, we can find solutions with 80% of guests placing into their first choice, another 10% into 2nd, and so on. 

Up to now, the seating was done by a piece 15 year old of software that is, frankly, a nightmare to use. I had looken into the code some time ago and found it to be an unreadable and unmaintainable mess.

Now, we can still use the old code, but I would like to do something from scratch, mainly for maintainability and to add a couple of bells and whistles, but also because I'm somewhat bored with my daytime job. I've looked into some known problems to get ideas from (assignment problem and the rabbit hole Wikipedia took me from there) but I'm stumped on how to approach this or which resources I should look into.

I'm taking APCS in high school and I have a quick question related to parent/child classes: If I have a child class constructor that calls up the parent's constructor as well as initializes a few different values of it's own, can I use the parent class's methods on the child class object? I feel like it should work, but the difference in the child and parent constructors is making me hesitant. 

In case the question is confusing, here is an example:

public class First {

public First (int a) 

}

public class Second {

private int c;

public Second (int b, int c) {

      super(b);

      this.c = c;

The CS major is a broad field; there are diverse topics like computer security, software engineering, design, etc. The graduates of the CS degree earn on average 70,000. My school released the statistics and companies that they work for. 

And I thought to myself: why do these people learn CS? Already, the CS knowledge can be learned online, essentially, for free on Udacity, MIT Opencourseware, Stanford Online, Edx, Coursera, and even some Youtube videos. Albeit, some of these online classes may be introductory, still there are some topics that can be learned online for free.... Also for me, I go to college to access the biology and chemistry labs since I need experience in labs- which no company or research firm will give me, so I have to learn it through school (where tuition is a skyrocketing $60,000). 

But CS is a skill that can be learned online and at home.... for free. 
So I don't know why these people are paying so much to have a piece of paper with the words- Bachelors of CS. Already major technology companies like Google don't even require a CS degree, since a lot of companies want to see projects which are a better demonstration and showcase of CS skills. (However, a CS degree is necessary to validate CS research and academia). 

Yes I know that the CS field already pays well.  [Sorry for the long post so far, but here is my real question]: 

CS is already a rapid growing field. The reason why CS majors make so much to do programming is because of the lack of current CS employees. But as the trend of those that are majoring in CS are continuing to rise, will the CS jobs be filled and the salary diminish according to the Economic Law of Supply and Demand? 

From my own personal experience in interacting with CS kids, it seems that a lot of them only know how to do CS. The kids in my school (and I'm not bashing on CS kids from other schools or anything), don't want to learn anything else... They don't like English to improve communications; or any other science to expand their knowledge. They only come to school to learn CS. 

And as the advances of artificial learning continues, and already some software can write their own codes, do you think those one-dimension CS kids will be out of jobs? Especially if they can't bring anything else into the table. 


And now before you start hating on me: Yes I admit, I write a lot. I need to get to the point quicker. I know my English isn't the best. Blah Blah Blah. I was just wondering about these CS kids. 
And yes I do take some CS classes with these CS majors since CS is an elective requirement. I don't complain about the CS classes (because I already learned the material online); but I do feel like the CS majors are wasting their time and money. Just an observation.

and no i'm not hating on all CS kids or people. I just need some different insights. ",8,0,False,self,,,,,

As the title says, I am in my first year of CS, and I enjoy the programming classes that I am taking. I am doing fine within my programming courses, but the math that I am required to take along side them is absolutely killing me. I am currently in Calculus I, and I am just barely managing to scrape by with a C. (I have to get a C for credit at my university) I am considering switching majors to IT, mostly due to the lesser math requirements associated with a degree in IT. 

As the year  has gone on I have realized that I do not believe I will be happy being a software engineer, I enjoy programming when I don't run into any major walls, but I couldn't imagine doing nothing but this 40 hours a week for the rest of my life. Currently, after college I want to be a penetration tester, and would like to do something with E-Commerce in my free time. My question is: would a degree in IT be as viable as CS for this career path?

I'm in college and I'm taking Computer Science Secure Software Development. 
So far we've been using Visual Studio to program in my intro to CS class.

I'm looking for a laptop that I will be able to use for everyday things and  in case I need to use it for school work like to program. The classes are going to be more in depth and programming will get more serious as the semesters go on.

Here are the laptops that I am looking at:


**Dell XPS 13**

6th gen intel dual core i7
windows 10 pro
8gb-16gb memory
128gb+ SSD
Intel HD Graphics 520
13.3 (1920x1080)

**Lenovo T460P**

6th gen intel quad core i7-6820HQ(coming soon)
windows 10 pro
16 gb memory
128gb+ SSD
Nvidia GeForce 940MX(Coming Soon)
14 "" (2560x1440) IPS


A question I have is does it matter a dual core or quad core when it comes to programming? I know the XPS 13 has a dual and the t460p has a quad core.

So basically I want to know can I use a dual core to do everyday things and program or should I get a quad core for the programming I will be doing.

or should i look at a different laptop for what I'm looking to do.

I'm a senior computer science and math major with two semesters left for my undergrad. I finish out my CS courses this semester and then work on finishing out the math courses.

I attend a medium sized state school with a relatively small CS department. I currently have a 4.0 cumulative GPA, and after this summer will have completed my third internship.

I'm positive that I want to eventually get my graduate degree and Phd, because I know I want to teach at the university level after working for a while. Would I be better off working and then getting my graduate degree, or applying for grad school during my last couple of semesters while all of my knowledge is still fresh?

I've also been looking into programs like CyberCorps, which is a government sponsored program that pays for grad school in cyber security. Are these programs worth considering, or is it better to find a way to pay for grad school myself?
