I am currently a junior in computer engineering. I love my classes and everything I'm learning. I'm also a TA for an intro to c class and help/teach a lot, and I really really love doing that. I'm interested in becoming a high school CS teacher, but I know nothing of how to become qualified for that position or if its better to work in industry and then become one. If anyone with any knowledge/experience in this area could give me advice, that'd be greatly appreciated.",3,2,False,self,,,,,
