I am building a configuration language, its JSON but C# flavored. The name CSON is already taken so I have yet to figure out a name. However, I am creating a library which contains all the tools youll need such as a lexer, a parser, and several code generators.

The way this library works is that you load a document, and the source code gets handed to the lexer which finds lexemes and turns them into tokens. Depending on what method you use to load the document Document() vs. FastDoc(), code comments and other trivia are stored in the token for when code needs generated. Each token gets added to a cache and the parser uses the tokens to generate a codemap that contains all the addresses/paths, as well for values.

So lets say we have the following code:

    Player
    {
        Movement
        {
            Speed = 100;
        }
    }

And we want to access the speed variable. What we do is:

    Document doc = new Document(path);
    
    int speed;
    speed = doc.GetValue(player.movement.speed);

So what if we want to make a change to that value? We can use the SetValue() method. When setting a value we can save the changes. What happens when we save our changes is that behind the scenes my library will create a new instance of the code generator class which will take in a codemap and generate code from it. There are two code generators, the regular one, and the FastDoc generator. There is a big difference between the two.

My language supports comments and other trivia. When using the regular load method, trivia is embedded into tokens. The regular code generator will include your code comments and generate code in the exact format and style as it came in. So the only thing that changes in the output is the value you changed.

The FastDoc, does not process comments and other trivia. It also doesnt include them in the output source code either. The FastDoc generator also includes automatic code formatting and refactoring. This method of generation is very fast, and should be used for files that need the speed like level editors, level loafers, server saves, game saves, etc. Rule of thumb, if the file will, or should, be encrypted, this is the method to use. If you plan on documenting your files, this should not be used.

I know this isnt a programming language, its a configuration language. However, what kind of library am I building? Is it a transcompiler sewing how it takes in code and regenerates it in the same language? I dont need to come up with a name for my language but when I release this DLL as open source once done it needs a name, and a description. Such as:

Video basics, raster scan graphics, Bresenham algorithm, viewports, geometric forms and models, polygon filling and antialiasing, halftoning, convex boundaries, interior and exterior clipping, hidden lines and hidden surfaces.


Introduction to Image Processing

This course introduces the basic theories and technologies of digital image processing. Topics include discrete representation of images, intensity transformations for image enhancement, spatial domain linear filtering, two dimensional discrete Fourier transform and frequency domain filtering, nonlinear image filtering, edge detection, image segmentation, and image compression.

Data Mining

This course addresses Data Warehousing and provides the students with a strong understanding of the fundamental Data Mining methodologies. The course covers topics such as data types and data preprocessing, Data Warehousing and OLAP, classification techniques, association analysis and clustering analysis.


Mobile Application Development

This course explores mobile application development using current mobile development languages. It gives an overview of the various frontend (client-side) methods to develop a mobile application. It also includes the necessary backend (server- side) development to achieve a minimal communication needed for an application to connect to a remote server in order to send and receive data. Note: I already know React, Javascript and node js for web development so I was thinking that this course is somehow irrelevant but worth mentioning. 


Principles of Communication Systems

This course provides an introduction to data communications principles and computer networks. The course covers the fundamentals of signaling, basic transmission concepts, transmission media, analog and digital transmission, data encoding and modulation; Shannon channel capacity, in addition to the TCP/IP layering model.


Fundamentals of Python

--No official description about this course-- but according to my friend who took it, it talks about OOP/UI/UX design, file processing, fully functional and designed programs with python, including a Pygame project.

Here are a few applications I came up with:

-Generate and see new colors that don't exist in nature

-Share memories 

-Download and apply new knowledge/skills

-Create augmented reality/mixed reality experiences that plug directly into sensory locations of the brain (this one I like a lot bc I imagine people will be able to imagine whatever they want and actually see it in front of them)

-Virtual reality that feeds data into all sensory areas of the brain

-Augment and heighten creativity

-Input data from iot devices into the brain/control iot devices (this one is interesting because it could enable a kind of teleportation by feeding data from a droid anywhere on Earth directly into the brain) more mundane uses would be just knowing that the dryer is finished drying clothes

-Design and experience new emotions that nature didn't evolve (maybe artists in the future will design brand new emotions)

-Change how we experience flavor so healthy food tastes good or unhealthy food tastes bad
-Perfect recall of memories

-Deleting memories (can we/should we?)

-Create some kind of brain-net where people can upload/download memories and experiences

Basically I would like to start a company in machine learning and AI. I have money but no experience. I could just hire a bunch of people that know what they're doing but it kind of takes the fun out of it for me. 

What I would like to do is get the knowledge, education and practical experience (mainly GitHub projects and kaggle) in computer and data science then progress through different courses online that allows me to understand machine learning and AI. 

I have limited time and responsibilities which can't be changed so what would you do in this situation to get to the end result? I'd like to start the company within the next 3 years and I have about 30 hours max a week to persue this. 

All suggestions are welcome and guidance is needed. Please correct me if I'm wrong about any projections I have also. 

I want to primarily create a software company that produces AI products for businesses mainly but I have some ideas on consumer products as well. I would look to a partnership with another company to produce the hardware for the physical product side if need be but as said, I would prefer to have a software company.

I'm thinking it would be best to have a parent company that generates the ideas for AI products and then I can individually start smaller companies for each of the products we come up with. That way we wouldn't be limited to one trick so to speak. It probably sounds like I want too much but I see no reason why it can't happen. I also don't want to be suffocated by one or two ideas. I want to be able to chop and change products and kill them off quickly if needed. Over time I expect multiple employees and grow just like any other successful business. My goal isn't a one man operation but a global company that is well known in the field of artificial intelligence.

Just to be clear. I'm starting a company that will heavily be centred around AI so good idea or not, it's happening. I appreciate your thoughts and insights but I'm really looking to be pointed in the right direction as far as education. Thanks.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  **Difference between a Value Type and a Reference Type**

* Value type: hold the data within its own memory allocation. Stored in the stack.
* Value types can be created at compile time and stored in stack memory.
* Value type: if assigned to another variable, the value is copied directly and both variables work independently.
* Reference type: contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data. Stored in the heap.
* Reference types are used by a reference which holds a reference (address) to the object itself.
* Reference type: assigning a reference variable to another doesn't copy the data, but instead creates a second copy of the reference, which refers to the same location in the heap as the original value.
* reference type examples: Classes, Objects, Arrays, Indexers, Interfaces

**What is an Interface?**

* an interface is a specification for a set of class members, not an implementation.
* an Interface is a reference type and it contains only abstract members such as Events, Methods, Properties etc.
* you can think of an interface as an abstract class that contains only pure virtual functions. This implementation of the methods is done in the class that implements the interface.

 Difference between an Interface and a Class

* A class is a full body entity with members, methods along their definition and implementation.
* An Interface is just a set of definitions that you must implement in your Class inheriting that Interface.

 Multiple inheritance in .Net

* .Net does not support multiple inheritance. This is why Microsoft introduced Interfaces - a solution for multiple inheritance.
* .Net allows you to have a single inheritance, but you are free to implement as many interfaces as you wish.

**Static Keyword**

* Static classes and class members are used to create data and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the Class. The keyword static can be applied to the classes, field, method, properties, operator, event, and constructors.
* they cant be inherited and these classes are sealed by default. Normally it is used to group related static methods in class.
* the advantage of static keyword is that it will make your code a bit faster since no object creation is involved.

**Jagged Array**

* An array which has elements of type array is called jagged array. The elements cam be of different dimensions and sizes.
* AKA an array of arrays

**Namespaces**

* namespaces are containers for the classes.
* Used for grouping the related classes in C#.
* uses the ""Using"" keyword.

**Polymorphism**

* provides the ability to a class to have multiple implementations with the same name.
* two types: static (compile time) and dynamic (runtime)
* method overloading is an example of static polymorphism. Overloading is the concept in which method names are the same with a different set of parameters.
* method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.
* method overriding can be done using inheritance. With method overriding it is possible for the base class and derived class to have the same method

**Inheritance**

* Inheritance is a concept in which you define a parent class and child classes.
* the child classes inherit methods and properties of the parent class, but at the same time, they can also modify the behavior of the methods if required. the child class can also define methods of its own if it needs to.

**Encapsulation**

* a process of binding the data members and member functions into a single unit. In c#, a Class is the real time example for encapsulation because it will combine a various type of data members and member functions into a single unit.
* Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

**Abstract Classes**

* Abstraction is the process to hide the internal details and showing only the functionality.
* The abstract modifier indicates the incomplete implementation.
* the keyword abstract is used before the class or method to declare the class or method to abstract.
* an abstract CLASS is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier *abstract*in the class definition.
* abstract classes cannot support multiple inheritance.
* cant be static.
* classes marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes

**Front End Best Practices**

* indentation
* semantic elements: elements with tags that clearly deifne the content included for both the dev and the web browser.
* class and ID names: using both class and ID names are practical and relevant.
* CSS reset: resets html elements to a consistent baseline
* avoid inline style CSS
* when to use inline style: HTML email, content management system content (wordPress, etc.), Dynamic content (HTML created or altered by JavaScript), older websites.
* popular javascript frameworks: Angular, React, jQuery, Vue.js
* naming variables: always use variable names that make sense. Use camelCase.
* Comments are very important
* Design for all Browsers and Devices: Responsive Web Design

**Back End Best Practices**

* Name things well: intelligent names, descriptive, tells us what the solution is
* use properties, not public variables: there will be intences where you wont be able to use a public variable and will have to use a public property
* methods should do one thing: separationof concern
* camelCase
* keep it simple
* concat strings using $"""" (uses less memory space)
* avoid global variables: use app.config for data. uses less memory and can be changed at runtime
* Use public modifier only when necessary: public method can be seen by other classes outside of its own class. Private modifier : can only be seen in that class.

**Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**

* Indexing is a procedure that returns your requested data faster from the defined table. Without indexing, the SQL Server has to scan the whole table for your data. By indexing, SQL server does the exact same thing when you search for context in a book by checking the index page.
* Clustered index : the type of indexing that established a physical sorting order of rows. Defining a column as a primary key makes that column the clustered the Clustered Index of that table.
* Non-Clustered : an index structure separate from the data stored in a table that reorders one or more selected columns. The non-clustered index is created to improve the performance of frequently used queries not covered by clustered indexes.
* The differences:
   * In a table there can be only one clustered index or one or more than one non clustered index
   * In a clustered index there is no separate index.
   * In a non-clustered index there is a separate index storage for the index.
   * Clustered is slower than non-clustered.

**http Protocols**

* hyper text transfer protocol
* the underlying protocol used by the internet that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.

**Difference between http and HTML**

* http is a protocol
* HTML (hypertext markup language) is a language.

**Dependency Injection**

* DI is a design pattern that allows us to develop loosely-coupled code.
* The intent of DI is to make code maintainable.
* DI helps to reduce the tight coupling among software components.
* DI reduced the hard-coded dependencies among your classes by injecting those dependencies at runtime instead of design time.

**Entity Framework**

* EF is the framework ORM (object-relational mapping) that Microsoft makes available as part of the .Net development.
* Its purpose is to abstract the ties to a relational database, in such a way that the dev can relate to the database entity as to a set of object and then to classes in addition to their properties.

**MVC**

* Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representation of information from the way that information is presented to or accepted from the user.
* used to develop web applications
* Model = application core (database records etc); View = the display that the user sees; Controller = manipulated the data gathered by the model.
* Advantages:
   * Separation of Concerns.
   * Multiple view support,
   * Change accommodation ( because the model does not depend on the views, adding new types of views to the system generally does not affect the model.
   * More Control
* [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/puranindia/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions/](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/puranindia/ASP-NET-MVC-Interview-Questions/)

**SQL Stored Procedures**

* prepared SQL code that you can save, so that the code can be resued over and over again.
* you can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

**Stack vs Heap**

* Stack = static memory
* Heap = dynamic memory
* The stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of whats executing in our code.
* The Heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of our objects;
* the stack is thought of like a stack of boxes and we can only access whats on the top of the stack and then throw it away.
* anything can be accessed from the heap at any time.",16,80,False,self,,,,,

I find it difficult to find people to read advance ""hard"" STEM material in a group. I am looking for people who are interested in collaborative learning that revolve around two core fields: mathematical physics and artificial intelligence.

Specifically, applying geometry and topology to physics along the lines of Yang Mills theory, along with interrelations among machine/deep learning, stochastic processes, and computational complexity. This is stuff that we could obviously study for a life time, and is no easy task, but could be very fun and profitable with diligent and wise efforts.

My background is a UCLA BS in math along with 10 graduate math and stats courses as an undergrad there in the scholars program. Much of it is analysis, topology (an algebraic topology course), probability, and higher dimensional statistics. Some number theory and abstract algebra. No differential nor algebraic geometry. I only know classical physics of Newton and Maxwell, and would like to go over some of the modern physics of the 20th century.

If you are interested in any of these topics, maybe we can find a common ground textbook to read together and help each other out with the problem sets. Brewing a little competition and collaboration can go a long way for motivation and dedication.

I currently have roommates but do have a room that is empty besides my desk and can get a table for others to join. In a week or two, my roommates move out as I start teaching, and I will have a very spacious apartment that we can host weekly meetings to go over our studies and talk about problems together. Alternatively, we can meet at a very spacious tea shop around the corner of where I live called Teapop at 5050 Vineland Blvd. Ideally, we would meet for at least 3 hours weekly distributed over one or two days.

If you are interested in starting a STEM reading club, please post your independent study areas of interest along with your STEM background. Post any books that you want to tackle. Ideally, a team of 3 to 5 people sounds good to me. Not too big that people's opinions are not appreciated nor stimulated, and not too small that someone in the team has no good mastery of at least physics and computer science, but ideally mathematical physics and machine learning.

I am okay with making the studies more diverse. They need not be entirely related to my specific interests, but it would need to catch some of my interest. I do like philosophy and classical literature, so am not against the idea of something like that.

If you want to contact me quicker, please text me at (818) 747 - 6487.

Finally, here is list of books that I am currently interested in reading, roughly in the order that I am interested in reading them:

Calculus on Manifolds, Spivak
Machine Learning, Murphy
Intro to The Theory of Computation, Sipser

Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology, Bott

Pattern Classification, Duda

Computational Complexity, Arora

Gravitation, Thorne

Deep Learning, Goodfellow

Analysis of Boolean Functions, O'Donnell

Algebraic Geometry, Hartshorne

Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Chuang

Boolean Function Complexity, Jukna

Black Hole Physics, Frolov

Nuclear Physics, Krane

Quarks, Leptons, &amp; Gauge Fields, Huang

If anyone can tutor someone doing independent studies in some of these books, then maybe I can give you business for possibly up to several years if you are up for the task.

Quantum computing is an extremely interesting and popular topic. Even though it is still in its infancy, it promises to change the computing landscape and even usher another stage to our civilizational development. This is all due to an exponential increase in computing power that it will inevitably bring. It will make all of the tasks that previously took months and years to complete easily solvable within days, hours and even minutes. The wide spectrum of its potential applications ranges from medicine to finance. It will solve tasks that were previously unachievable and revolutionize every sphere where it is applied. The potential changes that it will bring being groundbreaking, to say the least. Recent achievements in quantum computing and their practical applications will be described in the paragraphs below.

First of all, it is important to understand the fundamentals of quantum computing in order to see how it differentiates from classical computing and how is it capable of exceeding it. Its basis lies in a completely new approach to computing and to matter itself. It draws on the principals of quantum physics and operates on a completely new worldview of the universe. The quantum bits, unlike classical bits that are either 1 or 0, combine both in themselves. Allowing them to simultaneously exist in multiple states at once. This allows for multiple computations to happen simultaneously and is generally known as superposition. The best example to illustrate it would be the widely-known Schrodingers cat, which is in two states at once.

 My input for fahrenheit to celsius is 212.0, so the celsius output is 100 and my conversion from celsius to fahrenheit is 30.0, so the result in fahrenheit should be 86.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 17 and I've been coding for about 2 years nows, and I've been studying some javascript algorithms and data structures lately and learning some other languages ( HTML, CSS, Python, and I've decided to learn Ruby on Rail instead of PHP). But my biggest concern is I couldn't join APCS, my counselor told me that I couldn't take APCS because I have 2 math classes this year! I'm a Sr. so I'm a year away from college, and I'm scared since I didn't have APCS that I won't be as prepared as everybody else! I'm just a programmer trying to learn more.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a self-taught programmer so I could teach myself CS but IDK if I can learn more CS in a year compared to having an APCS class?",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Reason why I bring this question up is because after learning a little bit about Machine Learning and dabbling in Deep Learning, I have come to the conclusion that I thoroughly enjoy both area of studies, but noticed so far that I have been dealing with data sets and predicting the outcomes based on learning from them. After a little bit I started to wonder where the type of AI that can sense, reason, act, and adapt comes into play and what area of study that is. So I took to Amazon to see if I could find any books on AI, but to my surprise there really wasn't the many books that popped up, not to mention it didn't seem like these books dealt with what I was looking for.

So do I just have to continue with the machine/deep learning studies or is there something I am missing here?

I'm from Calgary and recently graduated high school. I finished with an 86.2% overall average and will be looking to upgrade during my gap year (didnt want to go into general arts at UofC).

I will be upgrading my chemistry mark (which is at an 74% and really weighing me down), potential taking physics 20 and 30 as well as calculus (plus working full-time) during my gap year. 

Obviously with my average, I cant get into schools such as UofT or Waterloo. I'm just not strong enough academically to get all my classes to a 95%. So my question is, what would be my options in terms of universities with a good computer science faculty that dont require an above 90% average? 

I truly believe that if I upgrade my chem (and maybe my English? Which is at an 83% but I'm quite weak in English), I can get approximately an 85-90% in the class, leaving my average between an 88.4%-89.4%. What would be some good options with this grade range? 

I've worked my ass off in school and yet I unfortunately came up short. Looking to redeem myself but I also want to make sure that the university i go to has a good compsci faculty and was looking for some input from you fellows. 

Additionally, is there anything I can do during my gap year (which I havent already mentioned I'm planning on doing), which would help me transitioning into computer science when I get to university? 

Thank you so much for your help, I truly appreciate it.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Dropped out at age 22 and am now 25 with on and off interest and coding through out the years. I am teaching my self discrete structures and am using the book ""Discrete Structures and its Applications"" to teach my self the subject before really delving into what will be intense Algorithms and Data Structures. I tried learning data structures once with minimal effort and had some fun but nothing really serious because I always knew I was ""missing something"". Upon opening up the book by Kenneth H. Rosen it felt as if Gregorian chants began to sing in my head because it seemed SO needed to properly understand data structures/algorithms and its application in edition to most other areas of CS that warrants a look. I never really touched discrete mathematics because in college even though I did good in Calculus 1,  I failed Calculus 2 for lack of not trying (I really hated doing the H.W.) and because I felt it was very very boring and non-applicable beyond my already college level understanding in edition to depression. I just never thought I needed to study discrete mathematics IN-DEPTH after having been TOLD Calculus 2 is the litmus test of a true software engineer which I think is not the case, wouldn't you think? In any case I have a basic understanding of Calculus I and am studying discrete structures, my question is how much of this is exactly applicable to software engineering? I went painstakingly through 1 chapter on *the foundations, propositional logic and proofs* making sure I understand the gist of it though I know only proofs by contradiction and by induction (I also am studying deduction) are really the only thing that is applicable so I skipped other proofs non essential proofs - I skimmed over sets for a few minutes and am now on the first Algorithm section. I will study Induction and Recursion, Graphs, Tree's and maybe Modeling Computation (Languages and Grammars, Finite-State Machines, Turing Machines, etc.) and perhaps Boolean Algebra because I mean this is C.S.) My question is will this be enough to get a sound and absolute understanding of Discrete Mathematics so as to apply it to Software Engineering at say IBM or Google \[Data Structures and Algorithms\] XOR will the various theory in-camped in the text be necessary? As the book goes on and I am becoming more proficient in reading a book like this and my intuition is kicking in and I no longer need to painstakingly go over the filler text to reassure my self. What is your opinion about what I am endeavoring on? It seems as if the most important math class anyone studying computer science should take is the one of the mathematics of computation but this is seldom stressed in college as I feel it should have been stressed.

For my game, I'm building a system where players have power/weight, and they can downvote each other, players with 66% of downvote weight are banned. The weight of the votes is calculated based on the total weight of the active players, and banned players cannot vote, so the total weight of the system can change during the computation. 

Can I make this computation, avoiding infinite loops?

# Constraints

 - The whole system is unveiled simultaneously, players and votes.
 - I have to compute this on the fly, so I cannot fix the total weight by using the final weight of a previous computation
 - I absolutely cannot count the banned players' votes, trolls are common
 - Also because trolls are common, a big percentage of the players can be banned at any point, so I can't either just count them in the final weight even if their actual votes don't count, because the minimum downvote percentage by legit players can grow beyond 100%.

# Cases

I already spotted the trivial case of a player with 66%+ weight voting himself down, resembling *""this sentence is false""*, so I disabled that.

But there's also the case where there's N players that together account for 66%+ weight, and where every combination of N-1 players still account for 66%+, and each of those agents downvote each other. So together they downvote each other but at the same time, because all of them are downvoted, all of their votes don't count. It's almost the same as the previous case but way harder to solve and even detect.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

I recently started working with C/C++ and I got to be honest, it's a nightmare. I understand the syntax and can code pretty well. The problem starts with different build systems and platform specific stuff. I undestand that to make something cross-platform I can use preprocessor #ifndef and all that stuff. But I am not confortable with all the different ""building and compiling stuff"" 

For example, with javascript I know that all i need is npm or yarn and stuff to organize the dependencies and porting it to a new OS is just one command away. With C/C++ there are different build tools, eg. ninja and make. And build tools for build tools (Cmake). There is the mess of  static and dynamic libraries that need to be linked depending on OSes. This is just so overwhelming. 

I can't make a decision. I am trying to make a game engine for the purpose of understanding the internals of games and it's a pain. I accept that this is what I HAVE to deal with if I want to even consider doing cross-platform in C/C++. It's the part of what makes it hard. I get it.

I really want to sink my teeth in this.  I want to know how do I build cross-platform stuff in C/C++ from begining to end. Testing, debugging, using other libraries. I want to stay away from IDEs like visual studio and all (part of the reason i looked into cmake). My objective is to understand the code BETWEEN the algorithms that make up a program. I want to know how things are organized in a project. how large projects like cocos-2dx handle all the testing and supporting compilation on different OSes (not a gamebuilt with cocos but cocos itself).

Now, that I have got that out of the way. What I want to know from you all is this: Is there a guide or a book that shows how large codebases in C/C++ are made? Obviously one book cannot cover this all. I need proper resources that guide me through all of this. I don't care if it's videos, books, posts etc. Are there some open source projects that are easy but complex enough to help me understand this all?

The devices use serial connections and we'll be making use of the Modbus protocol. I am still a student and am quite new to these lower level things so I had to research Modbus, and I do feel quite comfortable with it. The problem is that I need to be able to generate a CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check) for every message sent to the devices. I've spent all week understanding the math and how to calculate a CRC using different Generator polynomials, and I feel like I have a good grip on the theory behind CRCs. I just need help implementing the math in my code. I do understand a method of doing this but it calculates the CRC by shifting the Message binary bit by bit, but it's awkward to code and resource heavy. I did find an explanation on everything CRC, and it's been working great. I just don't understand the part on how to create a more efficient byte by byte CRC calculator. I have attached the two methods below and if anyone could explain to me how to do this I would be eternally grateful. Please. I have been stuck on this for 2 days and I am having trouble finding a proper explanation online.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

8. A Straightforward CRC Implementation

\---------------------------------------

That's the end of the theory; now we turn to implementations. To start

with, we examine an absolutely straight-down-the-middle boring

straightforward low-speed implementation that doesn't use any speed

tricks at all. We'll then transform that program progessively until we

end up with the compact table-driven code we all know and love and

which some of us would like to understand.

&amp;#x200B;

To implement a CRC algorithm all we have to do is implement CRC

division. There are two reasons why we cannot simply use the divide

instruction of whatever machine we are on. The first is that we have

to do the divide in CRC arithmetic. The second is that the dividend

might be ten megabytes long, and todays processors do not have

registers that big.

&amp;#x200B;

So to implement CRC division, we have to feed the message through a

division register. At this point, we have to be absolutely precise

about the message data. In all the following examples the message will

be considered to be a stream of bytes (each of 8 bits) with bit 7 of

each byte being considered to be the most significant bit (MSB). The

bit stream formed from these bytes will be the bit stream with the MSB

(bit 7) of the first byte first, going down to bit 0 of the first

byte, and then the MSB of the second byte and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

With this in mind, we can sketch an implementation of the CRC

division. For the purposes of example, consider a poly with W=4 and

the poly=10111. Then, the perform the division, we need to use a 4-bit

register:

&amp;#x200B;

3   2   1   0   Bits

\+---+---+---+---+

Pop! &lt;-- |   |   |   |   | &lt;----- Augmented message

\+---+---+---+---+

&amp;#x200B;

1    0   1   1   1   = The Poly

&amp;#x200B;

(Reminder: The augmented message is the message followed by W zero bits.)

&amp;#x200B;

To perform the division perform the following:

&amp;#x200B;

   Load the register with zero bits.

   Augment the message by appending W zero bits to the end of it.

   While (more message bits)

Begin

Shift the register left by one bit, reading the next bit of the

augmented message into register bit position 0.

If (a 1 bit popped out of the register during step 3)

Register = Register XOR Poly.

End

   The register now contains the remainder.

&amp;#x200B;

(Note: In practice, the IF condition can be tested by testing the top

 bit of R before performing the shift.)

&amp;#x200B;

We will call this algorithm ""SIMPLE"".

&amp;#x200B;

This might look a bit messy, but all we are really doing is

""subtracting"" various powers (i.e. shiftings) of the poly from the

message until there is nothing left but the remainder. Study the

manual examples of long division if you don't understand this.

&amp;#x200B;

It should be clear that the above algorithm will work for any width W.

&amp;#x200B;

9. A Table-Driven Implementation

\--------------------------------

The SIMPLE algorithm above is a good starting point because it

corresponds directly to the theory presented so far, and because it is

so SIMPLE. However, because it operates at the bit level, it is rather

awkward to code (even in C), and inefficient to execute (it has to

loop once for each bit). To speed it up, we need to find a way to

enable the algorithm to process the message in units larger than one

bit. Candidate quantities are nibbles (4 bits), bytes (8 bits), words

(16 bits) and longwords (32 bits) and higher if we can achieve it. Of

these, 4 bits is best avoided because it does not correspond to a byte

boundary. At the very least, any speedup should allow us to operate at

byte boundaries, and in fact most of the table driven algorithms

operate a byte at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

For the purposes of discussion, let us switch from a 4-bit poly to a

32-bit one. Our register looks much the same, except the boxes

represent bytes instead of bits, and the Poly is 33 bits (one implicit

1 bit at the top and 32 ""active"" bits) (W=32).

&amp;#x200B;

3    2    1    0   Bytes

\+----+----+----+----+

Pop! &lt;-- |    |    |    |    | &lt;----- Augmented message

\+----+----+----+----+

&amp;#x200B;

1&lt;------32 bits------&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

The SIMPLE algorithm is still applicable. Let us examine what it does.

Imagine that the SIMPLE algorithm is in full swing and consider the

top 8 bits of the 32-bit register (byte 3) to have the values:

&amp;#x200B;

   t7 t6 t5 t4 t3 t2 t1 t0

&amp;#x200B;

In the next iteration of SIMPLE, t7 will determine whether the Poly

will be XORed into the entire register. If t7=1, this will happen,

otherwise it will not. Suppose that the top 8 bits of the poly are g7

g6.. g0, then after the next iteration, the top byte will be:

&amp;#x200B;

t6 t5 t4 t3 t2 t1 t0 ??

\+ t7 \* (g7 g6 g5 g4 g3 g2 g1 g0)    \[Reminder: + is XOR\]

&amp;#x200B;

The NEW top bit (that will control what happens in the next iteration)

now has the value t6 + t7\*g7. The important thing to notice here is

that from an informational point of view, all the information required

to calculate the NEW top bit was present in the top TWO bits of the

original top byte. Similarly, the NEXT top bit can be calculated in

advance SOLELY from the top THREE bits t7, t6, and t5. In fact, in

general, the value of the top bit in the register in k iterations can

be calculated from the top k bits of the register. Let us take this

for granted for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider for a moment that we use the top 8 bits of the register to

calculate the value of the top bit of the register during the next 8

iterations. Suppose that we drive the next 8 iterations using the

calculated values (which we could perhaps store in a single byte

register and shift out to pick off each bit). Then we note three

things:

&amp;#x200B;

   \* The top byte of the register now doesn't matter. No matter how

many times and at what offset the poly is XORed to the top 8

bits, they will all be shifted out the right hand side during the

next 8 iterations anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

   \* The remaining bits will be shifted left one position and the

rightmost byte of the register will be shifted in the next byte

&amp;#x200B;

   AND

&amp;#x200B;

   \* While all this is going on, the register will be subjected to a

series of XOR's in accordance with the bits of the pre-calculated

control byte.

&amp;#x200B;

Now consider the effect of XORing in a constant value at various

offsets to a register. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

0100010  Register

...0110  XOR this

..0110.  XOR this

0110...  XOR this

\-------

0011000

\-------

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this is that you can XOR constant values into a register

to your heart's delight, and in the end, there will exist a value

which when XORed in with the original register will have the same

effect as all the other XORs.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps you can see the solution now. Putting all the pieces together

we have an algorithm that goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

   While (augmented message is not exhausted)

Begin

Examine the top byte of the register

Calculate the control byte from the top byte of the register

Sum all the Polys at various offsets that are to be XORed into

the register in accordance with the control byte

Shift the register left by one byte, reading a new message byte

into the rightmost byte of the register

XOR the summed polys to the register

End

&amp;#x200B;

As it stands this is not much better than the SIMPLE algorithm.

However, it turns out that most of the calculation can be precomputed

and assembled into a table. As a result, the above algorithm can be

reduced to:

&amp;#x200B;

   While (augmented message is not exhaused)

Begin

Top = top\_byte(Register);

Register = (Register &lt;&lt; 24) | next\_augmessage\_byte;

Register = Register XOR precomputed\_table\[Top\];

End

&amp;#x200B;

There! If you understand this, you've grasped the main idea of

table-driven CRC algorithms. The above is a very efficient algorithm

requiring just a shift, and OR, an XOR, and a table lookup per byte.

Graphically, it looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

3    2    1    0   Bytes

\+----+----+----+----+

\+-----&lt;|    |    |    |    | &lt;----- Augmented message

|      +----+----+----+----+

|                \^

|                |

|               XOR

|                |

|     0+----+----+----+----+       Algorithm

v      +----+----+----+----+       ---------

|      +----+----+----+----+       1. Shift the register left by

|      +----+----+----+----+          one byte, reading in a new

|      +----+----+----+----+          message byte.

|      +----+----+----+----+       2. Use the top byte just rotated

|      +----+----+----+----+          out of the register to index

\+-----&gt;+----+----+----+----+          the table of 256 32-bit values.

\+----+----+----+----+       3. XOR the table value into the

\+----+----+----+----+          register.

\+----+----+----+----+       4. Goto 1 iff more augmented

\+----+----+----+----+          message bytes.

255+----+----+----+----+

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In C, the algorithm main loop looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

   r=0;

   while (len--)

{

byte t = (r &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF;

r = (r &lt;&lt; 8) | \*p++;

r\^=table\[t\];

}

&amp;#x200B;

where len is the length of the augmented message in bytes, p points to

the augmented message, r is the register, t is a temporary, and table

is the computed table. This code can be made even more unreadable as

follows:

&amp;#x200B;

   r=0; while (len--) r = ((r &lt;&lt; 8) | \*p++) \^ t\[(r &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF\];

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very clean, efficient loop, although not a very obvious one

to the casual observer not versed in CRC theory. We will call this the

TABLE algorithm.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

TL:DR is **bolded**

Sorry in advance for the long post.  As the title says, I am a junior in highschool and will start looking for colleges.  I was wondering if you could answer some of my questions.  I am in the New England area, and a honor roll student and on varsity track, which is relevant information later.  A couple years ago, I was into the idea of cybersecurity a lot, and so I learned Java.  For some reason, I lost interest until recently.  All that being said, **what is something you wished you knew as a junior about cybersecurity?**  Do you know of great BS or Masters courses in cybersecurity in my area?  Can I do anything to prepare?  Is there something I can do to make myself stand out as a computer science student other than grades or sports?

I am a recent graduate in a health science field and have discovered that I have a serious interest in CS after taking a MATLAB course at a local university. I will be going back to school in January to complete a nursing program because I really like working with people + I love the work schedule. Last year I went back to school for some engineering courses after losing out on an Ergo engineering job (I have no idea how I got the interview because they mainly look for Mech. eng.). But after taking the courses, I found myself enjoying the assignments given in the MATLAB class and would like to continue learning more about the field. I have a hunch that having a health and CS background will become a valuable thing in the future if it isn't already. At the very least, it will give me the ability to work on really cool stuff in my free time!

If you guys have any advice on what I should learn next/where I should go (hopefully free lol) I'd really appreciate it. Or if you have any opinions on what I just said/advice in general, I'd love to hear it. I haven't done much research about anything.

This question isn't meant to define how math can be applied to computer science when it comes to algorithm optimization, machine learning, graphics, cryptography, etc. but as a means of skill and approach when it comes to the field in general. Anything numerical is essential in telling the story of implementing and administering the many processes of computation of course. There are many branches of mathematics that CS students and some programmers study in accordance to what they're designing and optimizing.

To make this more clear, in general, how lucrative is math and equations when using it in the means of something similar like programming and arrays? It all depends I'm sure. As a CS student or programmer, tell me how it all comes to play and to what level?

I have no prior experience in coding and have no clue whether I'll like it or not, but I am certainly eager to learn it and am attracted to it. The idea of becoming a software developer doesn't really appeal to me, that's why I'm thinking about MIS since It's  business oriented which I like. The idea of being an IT Manager excites me, although I am certain that it can be achievable with a CS degree as well with an MBA later perhaps. I do fear that it is maths heavy, I haven't done any maths in 2 years, in school I had very bad grades in maths but that was mostly because I despised it due to some personal stuff that made me give up on it, in cases where I did put my mind in it and applied myself, I did fairly well and understood.

So, what I'm really asking is whether CS will be too difficult considering the knowledge gaps I have in maths and also physics? 

Or is an MIS degree better if looking for more managerial positions, or is the CS degree combined with an MBA will provide that as well?

I'll make it short and sweet:

I graduated with B.S. in Maritime Administration (a niche business degree that focuses on the maritime industry) and I minored in economics. I had plans to go to law school but I currently work at a law firm and I've come to realize that I'm not cut-out to be a lawyer. The attorneys I work with now are all low-paid, seem to hate their life, and talk about going down a different career path all of the time. A lot of ""what could have been"" talks around the coffee pot. Not to mention that I find the work to be completely boring. 

Every night I go home to my fiance and I do freelance work, mostly in Python, but I've started learning Java (which is a little bit more difficult, but overall a good time, haha). At work during down time I usually read different books I've bought about programming and it truly interests me. I've also become sort of the make-shift IT guy here, but that's besides the point.

I'd like to pursue computer science because I know I'll truly enjoy doing that. The problem is that I've already graduated, I work a full time job, and I'm getting married soon. Obviously I wouldn't drop the wedding for a degree and my fiance says she'll support me through my studies, but it's just nerve wracking. 

Couple of questions for you guys/girls:

1. Do I need a CS degree to get a job in IT/programming?
2. Could I theoretically do it with my current business degree?
3. Is it worth getting because I genuinely enjoy it and it may open up more doors for me? 

It seems weird to go back for another B.S. rather than a higher degree like Masters or PhD, but I'm really wanting to.

I guess I'd just like some advice, maybe some personal stories, I don't know. It seems like a huge step.

I'm in my last year of high school and currently considering what to do at uni. I definitely want a degree related to coding because I enjoy it at school (altho, I gotta say, it's boring and slow, but I hope that'll change). I'm currently looking into further pathways; I'll probably do my Bachelor's degree either in New Zealand or Germany, and then would like to aim to get into one of the 'big good' unis like ETH Zrich or so.

Currently, I'm planning to do a BE w/ Honours in Software Engineering, but I've noticed that some of the unis where I'd consider doing a Masters seem to only list BSc in Computer Science as possible degree. I've emailed some of the unis to ask for elaboration (since the BE programme at the uni I'm looking at is essentially CS with more mandatory courses), but would like to ask about how, from an industry standpoint, that differs/matters/... I know that the Honours part in the BE is an add-on, but I'm also considering that if I did a BSc, I could branch out in other topics I'm interested in (for which I don't have the space in said BE). Since I plan to do a Masters either way, I doubt that'd matter.

Any advice/opinions on whenever that matters in the industry? The uni says that the BE is better, but also they'd make more money from that soooo",7,6,False,self,,,,,

Whilst working this job I found the role of management to be extremely rewarding and I was surprised that I was actually pretty good at it (although I still have a lot to learn).

I want to do something similar with my degree and I would welcome any advice you can give me for this. I think I really enjoy working with people more than computers (I still love them) and I believe I have a lot to offer in a work environment. I also have lots of sale experience in various other day jobs Ive worked. Are there many customer based computer science careers or there?

I understand that Ill have to gain a lot of experience before this is possible.

I am a graduate student in physics. But my work is mostly data science based. Meaning a lot of python, numpy, pandas etc., experience with Linux and computing clusters. I have some background in Algorithms, I took a course in undergrad. Here in grad school I am taking some ML courses, along side some that might be relevant to research like parallel programming. 

This is my question : As someone who is not from CS, what courses should I take (or in general how do I package myself as a decent employee) in order to have some chances of landing an industry position in CS. 

As in what attributes are employers looking for ? (Languages, OOPs, knowledge etc.)

I understand CS is a broad field, so I should probably specify that I am interested in the data science aspect of it (but if there are other fields that are actively hiring and I can be ready for them with a few courses then please let me know )

Alot of people who graduate as high energy physics PhDs end up as data scientists, but not being from CS and an immigrant (in the US) I know I am at a disadvantage. 

Maybe stringing together the tids and bits of my knowledge can help me to some extent.

I could reapply to UCR. The problem with them is my housing. It is pretty pricey for me and my family, and if I decide to commute, that is around 3 hours each day back and forth. On top of that, the university itself is pretty expensive.

I also considered Cal Poly Pomona.  I guess it is a little cheaper, but like UCR, it is around an hour away from where I live. I may have to think about on/off-campus housing, which may make CPP almost just as much as UCR. I heard that it is easier to get employed from CPP though.

Another option I have been considering is Cal State San Bernardino. This university is closer (only 45 minutes), so I can probably commute. Also, it is cheaper too; however, I am not sure about the quality of education. I am afraid that I will be missing out on a better opportunity with the other two options, but if I can get by BS and get employed in a good job, then I should go the cheaper route for the sake of my parents.

If the job doesnt workout immediately (which it likely wont), Ill likely work a regular retail/waiter type job while continuing to apply for developer positions and polish my web dev skills. &lt; thats the current plan of action, but I would really appreciate some insight into what else would be a good use of my year off in terms of my academic/career advancement.",3,1,False,self,,,,,

- tight budget. 60k for an academic year is little less than my yearly income, and sounds truly insane.

Thing is I have quite a bit of experience with computers; I know how they function, I'm up to date with all the latest news, etc.  All I do with my free time is read about computers, watch videos on computers and even programming which I have very little experience in.   

So it turns out all of this semester is gonna be the things I already know and read about all day everyday.  We wont be learning anything about HTML, Javascript, and CSS until the very end of the semester;  and of all things I already have experience in those from high school, all I need is a refresher then I'm gonna be flying through that.  

The only reason I'm so disappointed is because this was one of the two classes I actually care about, the other being Trig.  I understand there's always something new to learn, but I was looking through the text book and its all pretty basic stuff.  We've done like 3 chapters and I haven't had to read the book ONCE to answer any questions we've had on homework.  

I guess my question to you guys is how long until I'm in a class where I'm learning something significantly new?  I know I sound a little unappreciative and maybe like a brat but I'm honestly pretty bummed that Im stuck in this class for a whole semester.

He has also done significant work in epistemology, and is certain that the Popperian view, with some of his updates, is crucial to developing intelligent machines. Which, by his view, means machines that can create and understand explanatory knowledge regarding any topic. He calls them Universal Explainers (which we also are) and Universal Constructors. 

I'm re-reading his first book now, and he talks about how the universality of computation is a profound truth. It's not just that we can use computation to represent anything the laws of physics allows, but that we can use our laws of physics to compute it. We can computationally represent anything in our universe, using our universe. That implies a deep connection between physics and computation. Some people say that could mean we're in a simulation, but that totally missed the point. You can at least imagine a simulation that still doesn't allow that, and even the universe in which that simulation is running could be one in which that isn't possible.

So first my backstory. This year I went through my countries (that being Greece) exams to get into university and I did get into a cs department, just in another city. The problem is that my mother is now furious at me and is always saying about how I should have gone and studied economics as she believes they provide a more general education... I know that she is just upset that I'm leaving but I just can't sit and hear her spout about something which I believe is objectively false.

And thus if I go and study in the cs department I got into I'm gonna have to do my postgraduate degree here in Greece. So what I am asking from you is whether she is right or not and if not things that I could say to her to try and reason with her and make her understand that at the end of the day things will work out great for me.

My friends and I used to take computers apart, replace hard drives, CD-ROM drives, install RAM, etc. I learned basic HTML and took a C++ course in high school for a semester that I enjoyed.

I didn't pursue a career in computer science for 2 main reasons: 
1) My older brother works in IT and I didn't want to be a copycat - I wanted to carve my own career path.
2) My stepdad is old school and he doesn't even know how to turn a computer on. Rather than learning, he would always disregard computers as mere ""toys for kids"". I didn't realize it until later in life, but as a teenager I wanted my stepdad's approval so I forced myself to be interested in other things and forget about computers.

So when it came time for college, I decided to major in business. I graduated and have been working in accounting for the last 6 years. I've never really enjoyed accounting, but I've never really hated it either. I was good at it, so it was just something I did to pay the bills.

I've been at my current job for almost 2 years, over this time I automated a lot of my daily duties using macros in Microsoft Excel. I told my supervisor this at my last performance review, and showed him different tools I created - he was impressed, and he started giving me different projects to work on to see what else I can make. I started creating Excel tools for my accounting team by using macros at the VBA editor on top of my daily accounting work.

This leads me to where I am now - I think I ended up in the wrong profession. I think I would be much happier a computer programmer or software developer. I am contemplating changing careers, but I don't even know where to begin. I have no professional experience in the field and no formal education, plus I'm 30 years old there are plenty of younger people who are faster and sharper than me.

I think back to Europeans exploring Asia and Americas and saying what the fuck are they writing? Growing up I was always told the Rosetta Stone was so key into translating Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs and Ancient Greek. In school I was taught (and again Im a noob in this degree) scripts, computers and OS boil down to what 0s and 1s? Also when I mention language Im inherently talking about writing too. 

Q1: What goes into creating a new OS? Laymans terms. What differentiates Mac, Linus, Windows, etc. I remember a selling point when Apple was coming back and even to this day people say how their OS are harder to break or get infected virus wise bc (early on) so many people and tech used Windows.  Does language matter and its more of a difference in computer language coding becoming more advanced?

Q2: How important is an arithmetic of math? If humanitys understanding of math has evolved, but remains fundamental, more stable than how language changes, but is everyone using the same principles?

Q3: My inarticulate but most important question. How hard/easy is it to build an OS from literally nothing?  (Hard i assume) harder with my real question, what if you take mathematics and a language and just made a bunch of new symbols up? Im guessing its an incredibly hard task to completely re-symbolize math and language so its completely foreign to intrusion, (youd need people to also allow themselves to do the math or write within the confines of this new language so easily its like they do already inside the culmination of math and linguistics thats already established) 

But lets say you did that, am I wrong thats its hard to still break down and decipher for how that all works (or algorithms)? 

Summary: Do coders and computers operate in a defined system of (math, symbols, writing, languages) and what goes or would have to go, into recreating that system or is that system so fundamental (1s and 0s) its not possible? And why?",13,6,False,self,,,,,
