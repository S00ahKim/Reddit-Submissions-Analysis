Column B has about 350 distinct values (distinct funds) with repeats. There are about 8,500 separate rows, each distinct, since they represent grants made from a fund to an organization. 

Thing is, multiple funds make grants to the same organization, so that these funds are essentially 'connected' to each other through grant making.

I'm one of many college freshmen who have no idea what to major in, and I have a few questions about computer science. I'd also like to point out that I have no idea what I am talking about, and everything I know about computer science is based on hearsay.(which is why I'm asking questions, so pardon my ignorance) 

-Firstly, I have no background in programming or any of the technical aspects of computers.(sounds really stupid now that I think about it) Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I feel like most computer science majors in some way or the other have some experience with these things?

-If I have no prior knowledge or experience will getting my degree be significantly more difficult/Is the major not right for someone like me?

-What did/didn't you know prior to going into CS, did any of it help/hurt you?

-And if you don't mind posting maybe what you studied, how long you were in school, and maybe what you do for a living.(as I understand CS is a very broad area, trying to get a feel of some careers out there)

Well that is about all the questions I can come up with right now, thanks for any and all help you can give me!
