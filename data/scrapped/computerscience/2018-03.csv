Im really happy about this but also extremely nervous. 

The way the program works is that my school has made partnerships with tech companies where the school first picks whos accepted into the program and the next step is a speed interview session with all the partner companies. After the speed interview, companies pick who they want and arrange everything with the school to get the student started. Essentially, the school acts as the middleman here. 

It would be really and appreciated if any folks can tell me their experience with speed interviews, what are some talking points to focus on, what are details to avoid discussing. I have a tendency to talk a lot (I just really enjoy having conversations lol) so I want to be mindful and prepared beforehand that way I can make the best of this and hopefully land an internship this summer.

E.g. I'm just starting an algorithms course and couldn't care less about the proofs or math involved. None of it is really interesting other than the fact I know this will get me a great job after I graduate.


Is this bad?


I have no plans to drop computer science or switch. Unless someone tells me that my feelings are super abnormal and I should go do something else.


Reason I went into this field is because I use computers all the time, they are my life, I love them and think and know technology/computers are going to be the future in a BIG way - which is super exciting to me.
 

I have also realised it's probably the best field to be in career / job wise, big tech companies are confortable, lots of perks, and big pay, and abundant. So this is also exciting for me.



But the actual stuff is not exciting. I don't sit there during lectures enjoying what I am hearing - it doesn't make me sit in my free time thinking about what I've learned. 



I also feel like I don't fit in because of this. Everyone around me is SO different to me. That sucks but I'm trying not to let it bring me down too much.


**TLDR;** I don't enjoy lectures, none of the theory really excites me that much, I don't feel any need to use my free time to think about what I've learned or research it (like others), but I do like the idea of having a comfy software engineering job at a good company.

So, of course, everyone says that data science is actually just stats with CS, so it would make sense to take CS as a second major, right? Well, I realised that things are not so easy.

Taking 2 heavy STEM majors would probably have an adverse effect on my GPA, not to mention the huge time commitments. So, I don't know if the extra time and effort would be worth it. Now, before you go on saying that attitude determines aptitude, it is the truth that you can't just study your way in a short period of time for STEM like you can for liberal arts majors.

So, I decided that maybe I could just do a minor for CS instead. Which would help too, since:

1) Lesser modules to take, which equals to more time for the rest

2) I realised that I am interested in CS and the thinking process of code (i.e programming), but not so much for the higher level modules such as Introduction to Operating Systems or modules with long hours of projects.

But, it seems that minors are generally frowned upon, as it feels like you aren't really going the full stretch for whatever you are minoring in.

Tbh, the only reason I would want to get the CS degree is only because I feel like it would open up doors, especially those in the big tech firms. However, I still feel more passionate about Stats in general, and the coding/programming aspects of CS.

For what it's worth, I'm not planning to just stop at undergrad statistics. Seems like to climb up in the industry, you need to get a MSc in Stats, which is most likely what I'm going to do.

Another thing to note that if I decide to take the minor in CS, I would be able to free up more spaces to take up an Econs minor as well, which I think is also pretty complementary to Stats and CS as well? (correct me if I'm wrong) But on the other hand, people say that Econs also isn't really a hard science, but more of a social science with not much usage, especially at the undergrad level.

I've come across an optimization problem that i can't really put my finger on what exactly it is (neither could my friends) and I've come here to ask for your help!

The problems is: imagine I want to buy different kinds of parts from a set of different stores, and each store could or couldn't have each specific part, and I want to minimize the cost of buying all parts. The tricky part is that for each store I'd need to pay the shipping cost and sometimes buying a part at the lower price, means buying it at a store that the shipping would make it more expensive than buying it from a store that is more expensive but have other less expensive parts.

Initially I thought that this would be a [transportation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)), but then I realized that it couldn't be because the shipping would make my costs variable (but I could be wrong). A friend thinks that it can be solved as a linear system and it could use any linear programming algorithm but for me, because of the shipping, it is not possible to apply the solution (I'm really not sure about this).
My (lazy and because I love the concept) solution so far was to use a genetic algorithm to evolve into a solution, but it takes a long time and i'm not convinced that it reached the best possible solution, if any one could help me find a way to prove that I would be immensely grateful!

I'm trying to understand C3 Linearisation for a paper, and wanted to ensure what I am about to explain is correct as to how it computes its linearisation.

I had assumed that this [inheritance](https://imgur.com/V92x9uu) hierarchy (represented as a dependency graph) would be a good example to work through. I thought this, as while a more naive MRO algorithm like LPDFS would result in something like [D,B,A,C], that C3 Linerarisation would result in the more specific [D,B,C,A]. Is this not correct?

Just to confirm the hierarchy:

    Class A:
       foo()
    
    Class B: extends A
    
    Class C:
        foo()
    
    Class D: extends B, C

Here is my working:

    L(A) = [A] //singleton set
    
    L(C) = [C] //another singletone set
    
    L(B) = [B] + merge(L(A) + [A]) //A is selected as it is the only head
    = [B] + merge([A] + [A]
    = [B,A]
    
    L(D) = [D] + merge(L(B) + L(C) + [B,C]) 
    = [D] + merge([B,A],[C],[B,C]) //so clearly from here B is the valid head as it appears only in the head of lists. A and C both fail, so...
    
    [D,B] + merge([A],[C],[C]) //What now?

now here's where I get stuck. If I understand it correctly, A is the first head that does not appear in the tail of any list. So technically I should pick A, despite the fact that C would make a better, more specific head.

C would be valid too I believe, but I don't see any prioritisation over how many times the same head appears in a list. Is that a thing? Because if not, as far as I understand C3 would fail here. If someone could point out where I am going wrong here I would be greatly appreciative.

I was full of enthusiasm which helped me through a difficult term. For the most part, I did well but there were times I hit brick walls that wouldnt budge for weeks.

I started my 2nd term studying C++ the beginning of January and felt like I was having my ass handed to me everyday. I honestly didnt know if Id be able to do what was being asked of me.

Then things clicked. Not by magic but with lots of trial and error, coding in my free time, and really diving into the material. Now I might run into a small problem that makes makes me scratch my head but I generally know how to approach things. And Im writing programs faster than I could ever imagine which is nice for my sanity.

So I just wanted to share this update because a. I posted a whiny vent session in January and b. to encourage anyone struggling with a language.

Advice: 
Coding is like math where you get better by doing it. Do your assignments and if theres time, work on small projects of your own. I use my own assignments (after turning it in of course) to play with and personalize.

I started writing tutorials which forces me to revisit material from the beginning. Find a free app and work through the problems even if it feels silly studying what you already know. I find myself not having to look up every little thing because Im always refreshing my memory (no pun intended).

The thing that helps me most is talking through my problems. Get a rubber duck if you need to, pretend youre teaching a class - verbalizing whats going on and what youre trying to achieve works wonders! And take a nap. Sometimes the best thing you can do is see a problem with fresh eyes.

What should I make of this and how should this effect my future plans?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/82jygq/ive_consistently_done_horribly_on_course_exams/,gdjabgdjsabgjalksdg,1520381433,"In every CS course I have taken in the last 2 years, I fail or just nearly pass exams. However, I get very high A's or even 100s on my assignments, labs, and projects (generally, one of the highest or *the* highest grades for these things in my classes).

As a result, my final grades are entirely dependent on whether the professor gives more weight to exams or more to projects. Despite my proficiency being the same, my final grades have either been an A or a C.

My performance has actually been the exact opposite than most of my peers - who typically do much worse on the projects, but make up for it with the high exam grades. Some of my professors have even recognized this by allowing students to drop their lowest project grade, which helped them, but does not help me.

For me, exams are difficult because I find questions to be ambiguous and poorly written. It's not really a matter of understanding the material, but understanding what they're trying to even ask. Outside of exams, I can ask for further clarification. But I can't do that on exams. Once I actually understand what the professor is asking of me, I have no issues. I also do particularly poorly on multiple choice questions. With extended response, if I can't figure out what the professor is asking, I can just write out everything I think might be relevant to demonstrate that I know the information and hope for some mercy points. But with multiple choice questions, there can be multiple answers or no good answer - such as questions that ask for definitive answers when in reality, the real answer is ""it depends.""

I've tried talking to my professors about my poor exam performance, but all of them (minus 1) got defensive. If they're the ones that created the test, then me saying the exam was unclear is a direct insult to them. Likewise, they've also passed me off as arguing over grades saying that I wasn't prepared. Some have even said that ""maybe CS isn't right for [me],"" and I'll usually get a response that includes something along the lines of ""GPA doesn't matter,"" (which in my situation, it actually does because I'm a dual-business major where GPA is extremely important).

For what it's worth - so at least I know this isn't normal - one of my earlier CS professors who I worked with closely acknowledged this problem without me even bringing it up. He couldn't understand why I was bombing exams when he knew from working with me that I knew the material inside and out.

What should I take from this? Are my poor grades a truer indicator of my ability to do computer science than doing projects and assignments? Should I stop taking computer science courses entirely? I had intended to get a masters in computer science, should I rethink doing that? Should I stop doing computer science altogether and fall back to my business major?

To me, when learning a new topic, it is a good idea to first have an pictorial overview of it, and then in the process of understanding the detail, keep referring back to the picture. At the end of the learning process, zoom out, and link all the related parts together.

An example of such picture will be similar to the following (inside the linux kernel):

This picture is not the best to express what I mean, but it has the general idea there. 
Think of each object as a node (or topic/subtopics), and there are lines connecting the nodes. (The lines denote relationships between nodes.)
Another example would be something similar to those ""Javascript in one picture"" kind of pictures.

""The Game of Life was devised by Cambridge mathematician John Conway. It is not a game in the sense that it is played by two or more people against each other. It is a game that simulates a simple life form.

The Life world is a two-dimensional plane of cells. Each cell may be empty, or it may contain a single life form. Each day, life forms are born or die, depending on the number of neighbouring life forms in a particular cell from the previous day. A neighbour is a cell that adjoins the cell either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The rules for the Game of Life are:
	This is an image of cells.

        If a cell is alive and it has two or three neighbours, it will continue to live the next day; otherwise, it will die.
        If a cell is not alive and it has exactly three neighbours, it will be born the next day; otherwise, it remains not alive.

Write a computer program that simulates the Game of Life on a 20 x 20 grid. To initialize the grid, the user can specify the number of live cells during the first generation. ""

I've recently been trying to learn to program in python but Ive been experiencing this overwhelming feeling of a desire to understand the underlying structure behind everything Im doing. I want to be able to understand how computers work from the ground up, how hardware and software relate to one another and develop an intuition for their potential. I'd also like to know how all these languages that build on top of each other all rely on the same fundamentals and what those fundamentals are. Only then do I think Ill feel comfortable and satisfied learning and working on a more superficial abstraction which I consider python to be.

Can any of you recommend a path I should take in order to satisfy this need? Whether that be a particular order of learning certain topics or more specifically any book, video, course that you might consider appropriate given my situation.

I'm a normal CS student at some university.  I first entered to programming world through iOS development in 11th grade.  I didn't do much after developing one super simple app that didn't even get to App Store.  Then I found out that there's a major dedicated to programming and related subjects so I applied and got into CS.  

From school, I learned data structures, system programming, and data science, AI, and all those things that you would learn from usual CS courses.  For my side projects, I tried booting up an Ubuntu server on a machine and wrote simple scripts that would use APIs of various services on it.

All of these were fun.  However, they were not fun enough to stop me from watching TV shows, reading comics, or reading Facebook posts (these are my time-killing hobbies).  I'm not sure whether this is a matter of me not fully accepting the fact that programming could be a really enjoyable hobby or the nature of programming itself, or something else.

One thing that's working out well is that I'm following many software companies and programming community pages on Facebook, and I get a lot of exposure to some great blog posts and news articles about software and related topics, and I really like reading them.

Finally, my point is that I want to really feel that geeky vibe.  I want to fall in love with programming.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with playing games, watching TV shows, cooking, and etc, but regardless of what I learn from school, I want to make my relationship with programming as something that resembles my relationship with my hobbies.  Since I will be learning technical sides of programming from school and online, I really want to learn how to love programming, how to make that mindset.

Just to make sure, this is not about what kind of projects I should do in order to utilize what I learned.  It's more about for those of you who actually say my hobby is programming, why is it and how did that happen, what were some triggering moments that you feel that programming is so much fun?

For databases, I have heard that a sound knowledge of SQL is very much appreciated by employers and is also applicable a lot in real life.

I keep hearing that although learning about compilers is not necessarily applicable in real life, it helps you become a much better programmer because you know the ins and outs of a compiler and what it expects. 

I also hear that a sound knowledge of computer networks is very applicable in understanding how different systems communicate with each other and, therefore, how one can code efficient systems to act accordingly.

For cryptography, I have heard that there are plenty of jobs available in the field such as security engineering etc.

And obviously machine learning is huge these days and has applications to a variety of fields like AI, CV, robotics etc.

Do you see anything wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/83kxcl/recently_took_on_an_internship_at_a_local_tech/,starzwillsucceed,1520746831,"So, here's a little bit of the backstory for you. I was told by a friend that a local tech company is trying to bring jobs back to the area by bringing in local people that are desiring to work in the field, but need some work experience to get a job. He then said that I should just come in on the day they have internship meetings and join the internship so that I can start working on projects in the near future. So I did, I came in and immediately had a weird feeling about it all.

When I came, the director of Marketing was really pushing the rest of us to tell all of our college buddies that are going for computer science, marketing, art, or business to come down and become interns with the rest of us. No prerequisites, just come on down, and you'll immediately be considered an intern.

The thing that struck me as weird is there was no formal interview, no contracts to be signed except for an office contract that was like 5 pages, and I barely got a chance to read it when I went to sign it, but they told me it was just to be able to be there and know that if I were to do anything illegal, they had legal manners to deal with it. I signed it because they seemed like honest people.

Anyways, skip a few weeks and now, there is probably 25 to 30 of us that are coming to 4+ hour internship meeting which are designed to make us better as a team, but that's not what it feels like to me. It honestly feels like a waste of time. Why might you ask?

Well, first off, the two main guys that run this seem to think that the best way for us interns to learn is to find something we are passionate about in our field and then teach it to the rest of the group. There is no formal teaching from any of the more experienced people that work there.

Secondly, there main focus is this free code camp that is an online program to get people into coding. They swear by it and I'm not really into as it doesn't really teach you anything other than make you do puzzles to complete and doesn't really explain anything to well. I'm a computer science major in college right now, so I have about 2 years of experience already coding, so I flew through like 260 plus of these lessons in a matter of days.

Finally, they just assigned a bunch of projects they need done to the groups that were formed by them of all the interns and it just doesn't seem like it's really a method of learning. They seem to be pushing these projects that are geared towards benefiting them and their business more than it helping us become better at our programming abilities. It all just seems super rushed and with the amount of people that are coming in, I wouldn't be surprised if in a month from now, they will have 50 plus interns working there.

Did I mention that none of these internships AREN'T paid? Only method of getting paid is these small projects that they say they are getting that will be worth $500 here and there when they come in. In fact, one of the projects that was assigned recently was a business that needed a way to market their product via social media and it was assigned to a team to do it for free. The guy said, oh man, this will look great on a resume that you did this. But, there was no contract signed saying the team who got assigned this project would get compensated for any of it, which means the business that is utilizing it will be getting more money coming into them without paying a dime. Unless the company I'm interning for is going to be getting paid for it, but never told any of us that.

Anyways, this seems like a long post, but there is so much more to this that I wasn't able to really get into all the details, but just wanted to see what all of your first reactions were to this situation I'm in. Does it sound like a normal internship program to be in? Does it sound a little shady? Thoughts?

edit* : I forgot to mention, the marketing director says that he wants to create this Code Academy that will allow us interns to become teachers to these weekend workshops which will cost people who come $99, these 6 week long workshops that will be even more money, and then wants to develop this 11 months long workshop that will cost people that join like $3500. To me, I just see it as a big money grab by them and just getting as much free or low payed help as possible with no real qualifications. He did say they would be paid gigs for us, but still, I don't know how much you can ask an intern to become formal teachers for these code academy workshops when they don't have any real world experience yet.",14,13,False,self,,,,,

I was undecided at first but during my sophomore year I decided to take computer science for my major because of the high job prospect. The introductory course was taught in python and I did okay in that class but after that was kind of a disaster. I probably have to retake at least 2 courses and my college GPA was 2.8 at the end of my junior year. After my junior year I decided to go back to my country and finish my military service. Luckily I have a lot of free time to do my own things and I'm trying to start again from the basics to build a stronger foundation. I've started introductory cs classes in edx and udacity and it's going well. But I only have a year and a half until I go back to my college. I don't want to change my major and I can't quit at this point. I really need to have proficient skill/knowledge in computer science and programming by the time I'm in my senior year and I think this is my last chance to actually get proficient.

This are the complete instructions:
When calculating daily interest, the formula to use is the compound interest formula. The formula is:

This is the formula for compound interest. A=P(1+i)^n

A = final amount
P = principal amount
i = interest rate per compound period
n = number of compound periods

The daily interest feature should ask the user the amount of the annual interest rate, as well as the number of days to leave the balance invested. It should then add the interest to the current balance.

I'm a Biochemist looking to develop coding skills, and I've been accepted into the Uni of Hertfordshires MSc CS course. I've gone over the course modules, and they have basic programming courses and web development, including database designs, but some of the other units seem very ""fluffy"" and not at all useful for computer science. The course is only 180 credits, so I'd be taking roughly 5-6 units, and completing the course in 2-3 years part-time.

The modules are

Core Modules Optional Programming and Program Design - 30 Credits

Level 7 Core Modules Computer Science MSc Project - 60 Credits Contemporary Practices in Information Technology - 15 Credits Optional Advanced Database - 30 Credits Distributed Systems Security - 30 Credits E-Learning Applications Development - 30 Credits Interaction Design - 15 Credits Learner Centred Design - 30 Credits Measures and Models for Software Engineering - 30 Credits Mobile Standards, Interfaces and Applications - 15 Credits Multicast and Multimedia Networking - 15 Credits Secure Systems Programming - 15 Credits Software Development Tools and Methods - 15 Credits Software Engineering Practice and Experience - 30 Credits Web Scripting and Application Development - 30 Credits Wireless, Mobile and Ad-hoc Networking - 15 Credits

What are your opinions on this course? I feel it won't set me up very well to learn computer science. They've told me that despite not having a background in programming, I can develop these skills through the course. If any one has other recommendations on other CS courses, I'm all ears. The course fees for this is about $14000, which is reasonable for me.

A little about me.

I'm 33, have 2 kids, a house, cars, the normal adult responsibilities. Recently I've had less and less drive to do my current job and am tossing around the possibility of changing careers. I'm a Paint Technician for a large automotive restoration company. I have no degrees or training certificates of any kind. I enjoy working with computers and have always been intrigued by technology and how things are made. 

So my questions are:
1. Is it too late to change careers into computer science?
2. Is a bachelors necessary for a career in computer science or would certificates in multiple training programs suffice?
3. Is it hard to find jobs in this field with no experience? If yes, how can I better my chances of landing a job.
4. With my age do you think companies will look at hiring younger, fresh out of school graduates?

I've read a decent amount about the field and have a friend who is a programmer with degrees in computer science and other certificate programs so i'm somewhat knowledgeable about it. Any insight on your experience with the field would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to answering questions if anyone has any too. Thanks in advance for the insight.

A farmer records the milk production of a herd of cows. Every cow has a unique 3-digit identity code. Each cow can be milked twice a day, seven days a week. The volume of milk from each cow is recorded in litres correct to one decimal place (yield) every time the cow is milked. The size of the herd is fixed. At the end of the week the total and the average yield for each cow for that week is calculated. The farmer identifies the cow that has produced the most milk for that week. The farmer also identifies any cows that have produced less than 12 litres of milk on four or more days that week. 

A program is required to record the yield for each cow every time it is milked, calculate the total weekly volume of milk for the herd and the average yield per cow in a week. The program must also identify the cow with the best yield that week and identify any cows with a yield of less than 12 litres of milk for four or more days that week.

Write and test a program for the farmer:
-Must include prompts for data entry
-Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably
-All constants, variables and other identifiers must have meaningful names.

The thing is that I found [this paper][1] that talks about the WEBMO model (based on COCOMO II) which presents a method to calculate the development costs, basically the method is:

 1. Count and classify web object predictors and multiply them by the corresponding weight according to the complexity (just like in table 4).
 2. Transform the number obtained in 1. into #KSLOC using table 7.
 3. Use the equations at the end of the 3rd page to get the estimation for the effort and time needed to develop the web application.

But I had a doubt about the example shown in the paper... what bothers me is that in the table 4 it says that 16 HTML lines represents 17.98 percent of the effort to finish this proyect (because 16 * 4 = 64, which is 17.98 percent of 356, the total size of the proyect), which then it's said it's a 5 month proyect in the 4rd page, WTF? **16 HTML lines is the 17.98% of a 5 month proyect?** it's a typo? or they were referring to 16 HTML files?

Besides that I **have tried to find the factors that multiply the number of XML, HTML, and query lines in low complexity, high complexity and number of scripts in high complexity in the web object calculation worksheet, but the problem is that what I've found has other multiplying factors**, for example in [this book][2] it says that an average multimedia file has a weight of 2, but in the example of [paper][1] that I previously put the weight for the same item is 5, not 2.

I enjoyed and understood it, but I wasn't really passionate about it, so I did some research to find out what would better suite me. After a few online quizzes, I was pointed to major as a computer science or engineering major. It made sense why it pointed me to those majors as you'll read further, but I have my worries. I haven't decided what I want to commit myself to yet as well, but I'm leaning towards engineering. I understand the differences between them and what classes I'd be taking for each of them, but I just want to know if experienced computer programmers/engineers think I can be proficient in it being the person I am (if that makes sense). I understand these courses tend to be difficult, but I'm the type of person who likes to be challenged. I actually enjoy and excel in math as well as many of my other classes. It's weird but I like going to college classes and actually learning (provided I have a good professor). Also, I consider myself to highly understand the basics technology, computers especially (whats new, how it works, etc.). I've built five computers  over a period of 5 years, (2 for friends, 1 for my brother, and 2 for myself) and I have gone to great lengths to understanding the basics on how each part works because they intrigued me. I know what components work better with other components, and friends always come to me when they need help with anything that is wrong with their computers. I'm honestly a bit addicted to technology and I'm always trying to learn something new about them that I hadn't already known (I spend a lot of time on my pc). I know I'm not an expert, but I do know a lot more than I can type here and it would be easier to get my point across in person. Im not good at conveying my point, sorry. I'm passionate to work with computers, but I have my drawbacks. Although, I have knowledge in the components of computers and their basic functions on how they operate, I have close to no experience in coding. As experienced as many of you are, is it hard to learn coding from scratch? And what resources can I use to help me understand/remember it? I haven't taken any computer science classes yet because I just switched my major not too long ago, but I want to get a headstart on my path in coding before I start my classes next semester. Is there any recommendations to what language I should start off with? Any online tutorials or anything? What did you do to understand coding? Thank you for your time and response, if you have any questions for me, then I'd be happy to answer. ",8,6,False,self,,,,,

10. **Programming/coding** - I've been self-teaching myself programming, more specifically web development over the past few months or so where I started taking it seriously. I'm working on my Javascript ATM. Before that I was an on-and-off hobbyist game programmer.  

9. **Math** - I love working with numbers, learning about different methods on how to do different problems, etc. No doubts about my math skills!  

8. **Knowing that I'll have a bright future** - I know CS is very rigorous, but knowing what possibilities are out there after graduation have me very intrigued. Would not mind making sacrifices now to set up my future self.  

7. **Learning** - I like going to school; the more I learn, the more fulfilled I feel in my life. Same goes for what I do at home where I'm teaching myself web development.  

6. **Solo work/projects** - The feeling of progression during a (programming) project is so satisfying, and I like being able to take small steps at a time to reach a big goal.  

5. **Money** - Money can't buy happiness, but it sure can rent a lot of it :P  
  
  
  
---
  
  
  
##What I don't enjoy as much:  

10. **Theory** - This is one I really dislike. CS seems to be theory-heavy, and it's one of the things I really don't like about school. I'm a more practical learner who learns by doing things. Reading out of the book or going to lectures just won't cut it for me. I learn nothing that way and I get really bored.  

9. **Communication/leading a team (Mostly pertains to future occupations)** - I'm introverted/asocial, and prefer doing things on my own or following set directions from lead team members. But I always try to get along with everyone I get in contact with and would be open to learning social skills I lack for the workplace.  

8. **Reading** - Again, I'm a practical learner, not a theoretical/reading type of learner. Whenever I read out of my textbooks, the words don't stick with me at all.  

***

##What is my situation?  

**I am** a 20 year old college student finishing up an associate's in an unrelated field. I feel like this field isn't the right fit for me because I'm not taking advantage of my math skills. Also I don't have many responsibilities, don't have to work, no girlfriend, so I feel like now is the time to go all-in on something that will set me up for when I decide to take on more responsibility in the future leaving me with no regrets. I can expect to have a good deal of financial aid for whichever program I decide to go in. Transportation may be an issue, so I'm also looking into the possibility for online CS programs.  

*****  

##What is my current goal(s)?  

**Right now**, I'm looking to get into an occupation that takes advantage of my efforts to self-teach, my math/problem solving skill set, and pays well with the possibility of working remotely. This is one of the reasons why I started teaching myself web development; it fits the criteria I just listed. I will continue down this road if I end up not going for a CS degree. I may still continue down this road if I go for a CS degree, but there are a bunch of options that open up to me that are worth exploring. I'm looking for suggestions of what you feel like would suit me the best based on my interests aside from web development.

I need a PC application that allows an user to use a bar code scanner to scan the 3 barcodes on each student's card, and print a label. The label will show a single barcode in a consistent format that contains the student info concatenated in a certain format. So if the student ID is 300, weight is 80, score is 20, the label single barcode will corresponds to 3008020.

The PC application needs to have dialog boxes that allows the user to manually input a certain field in case some barcodes cannot be scanned. Under normal use, the PC application should prompt the user to scan each student barcode, possibly via moving the cursor through different field boxes, which gets autofilled if successfully scanned.

Please tell me the easiest way to achieve this. I obviously need a barcode scanner, a PC, a suitable printer. But what about the software portion? If there are no off the shelf software then I need to do it from scratch, but I have no idea what tool to use for this...

I chose this major because cyber security looked so cool in movies and such but I have no practice in it. I thought that computer science was about hacking and what not. I realized that it wasnt after taking a few classes. I knew  I loved coding since my cs classes at high school but I guess my question is how did u guys end up choosing what to focus on this very broad field. I dont know if I would like to design apps, games, websites or maintain security. I just know that I like to code and solve problems through code.

I am currently a CS major and I was thinking about any potential minors/second major I could add on. The things that interested me were stats, econ and math.

So this is what I could possibly do: Major in CS and double minor in two of stats, econ and math. Or I could double major in CS and econ. Unfortunately, it won't be possible to double major in either CS and math or CS and stats.

So I just wanted to know what you guys would recommend? I've heard that stats would be particularly useful for many areas like data science and machine learning/AI. I've heard econ is useful for things like the financial aspects or for participating in an MBA in the future. I guess math would have similar advantages to Stats.

I was leaning towards a double minor in Stats and Econ because I felt that a double minor in Stats and Math would be a bit redundant. But then again, econ will cover stuff like econometrics which is quite similar to stats. So I'm not entirely sure.

So I just wanted to know what you guys felt? Which combination will be the best for career prospects and general real life applicability?

I am at a loss as to how to fix this issue. I have placed the exit condition as ""exit when eof"", but the loop still continues.

#2 After the first run of the loop, the program pauses to get my input. 

I believe this is the computer confusing ""get : ogFile, name"" and ""get ogFile""; however, I'm not sure how to fix this. 

#3 Line 83 and beyond do not work. 

I am unsure as to why this is, but when the eof error was not present, the few lines did not print anything on the text file. 

A few demo lines of 2017_sales_summary.txt:
