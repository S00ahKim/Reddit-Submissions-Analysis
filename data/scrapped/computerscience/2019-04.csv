In the degree, I've learned all the regular master degree concepts, so not a novice.

In the PhD, I've developed several projects on my own or in limited collaboration to a proof-of-concept stage to demonstrate certain research questions (for instance, creating an operating system for embedded devices that is multi-tenant secure through software).

During the PhD, I often wrote code as a means-to-an-end, just for myself. The coding was almost exclusively done in Python, Java, and C. So there was not a lot of focus on clean design, more advanced development/architecture, working as a part of a bigger team. As such, I'm afraid that I am now rusty in essential skills for a more 'conventional' job.

I'll start work in a couple of months for a services company that focuses on IT automation. They basically send consultants that help run a companies IT workflow automatically so that their services and processes are run more effectively. They do this through regular cloud management and automation tools. Now they want to go for a new self-developed product that enables this efficiently, and so integrates or uses Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Packer, Azure, AWS, ...

During the PhD, I developed a similar framework as part of research and I will become the responsible person for developing the product.

I'd like to prepare for this as well as possible. Given my background, and what I'll be doing, what tutorials, guides, etc can you recommend that can help me tackle this? It is a bit of an open question but I hope you can suggest several worthwhile resources.

The book Clean Code has already been recommended to me. Other sources (as well as online) are welcome!

Edit: Summarised, online free sources that help improve skills a Master CS/PhD guy might lack or have not developed once he enter the industry job market (in an automation IT context).

We graduate this year. Lately I have been concocting this little fantasy of  pursuing a Masters in CS. I am a journalism student, as well, and I am very interested in machine learning applications to the field of journalism in order to combat misinformation. I dream of one day being able to see all political opinions represented through evidence and understanding, and I envision many applications of Machine learning in order to gravitate the bias of the public toward verifiability and honesty. Research in this field sounds incredibly rewarding,though severely ambitious. I am wondering if this is a route I could feasibly follow. 

I have no programming experience, and little hard math experience. My skills lie in the arts, as well as critical thinking. The math I do enjoy involve proofs and logic problems. My husband however is the top CS grad at his university this year - an amazing teacher, and really the only way I believe I could make it is with his guidance. I would likely only enroll part-time. I could likely get great letters of recommendation, my GPA is above a 3.2, though I have a few black marks on my transcripts. The university I would attend is not particularly competitive, and my husband is often astounded by the students who manage to get degrees with so little skill, he is encouraging me greatly to do this and has amazing faith in me - I am more skeptical.

I have questions. 
What are some key skills someone in my position should work to acquire if they are hoping to pursue a Masters of CS?
What do these grad programs look for in terms of acceptance?
Do you have any similar experiences - relating to entering graduate programs without a relevant undergrad degree?

However this semesters class has me thinking that I am in fact still a beginner and not even intermediate.  The highest grade I have been able to get is a 50 on the second project and from there it goes down hill to single digit scores.  The specific project that is doing this to me is one where we have to build a lexical analyzer and a recursive descent parser given a grammar.  I am 100% lost. I understand the concepts taught to me but when it comes to putting that together in code I cant even begin to write because I just dont know where to start even though I have spent countless hours on YouTube and the internet looking through PowerPoint slides and going to office hours. No matter what I do I feel like I know nothing which is frustrating because I know for a fact that this is what I want to study and work.  The class is heavily curved so I will likely still pass but I feel like with what Ive been doing if I went into the workforce I would be bad for a team if I even passed the screening.

&amp;#x200B;

**LIST:**

I think that good programmer that want to be able to make a great application independently or supervision the work of other programmers at bigger projects would be need to know in details or not, but the topics like:

\- programming language

\- UI framework (in general, because there is plenty of ways and technologies to create GUIs)

\- IDE

\- 3rd party available libraries

\- design patterns, antipatterns

\- unit testing

\- some security concepts, cryptography

\- something about networks (protocols, ip, layers, something more?)

\- databases

\- regex

\- working methodologies like agile (I do not like this actually)

\- ... what more?

&amp;#x200B;

**I ask you what other concepts / issues / tools etc I should know about or learn. And for what spent most focus at?**

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY I ASK:**

I am around commercially 2.5 years experianced developer in .NET, I am mainly focused on backend, but I do know XAML and WPF so I can make (maybe not so pretty) but full apps alone. In the close future I would like also to be able to produce smartphone (probably via Xamarin) and web applications (probably via ASP.NET CORE 2, eventually ASP.NET CORE 2 MVC). I think to go for Microsoft developer certification, one by one.

I have a lot of ideas that I want to produce as an applications, but I have a problem. Some time ago I started some interesting projects, some I have finished and at some I have got stucked at one moment. It gave me experiance that I needed to start working commercially, but as I remember I did lots of things wrong and it had to be rewrited to go further sometimes, and in general I had weak basics, so to produce an app it took me a lot of time. Part of this was so specialistic knowledge which I would never be full with, but part of this was because of lack of basic knowledge.

So I decided to stop doing projects of my ideas for some time and learn basics well, so after time I would be able to produce applications faster and with better architecture in mind, so it would not stop me after some time and I would be able to make realisation of my ideas fast and smooth as I can (accepting specialistic problems). Then I spent too much time on learning too many things I guess. Now I would like to set some borders for the next year of learning and then come back to producing my ideas as the applications and rewrite my old apps.",1,0,False,self,,,,,

2.) When the medicine is dispensed and not taken after a certain time, it'll send an alert to the user's phone to remind them.

Since we have been programming in object oriented languages from the start, it's difficult for us to think along the lines of functional paradigm. That's why it takes me a little longer than usual for writing the code. But my teammates have found a reference for a very similar idea and are copying the code from that. So, I'm lagging behind and might lose some marks coz I would not have done enough work. Personally, I feel uncomfortable if I wrote a code and I don't know what's happening inside.

You are to write a menu-driven program that reads in a string from the user and gives the user the following options:

2. Report the number of consonants in the string

3. Report the number of lowercase letters in the string 

4. Print out the characters of the strings that are in even positions in the string (Hint: use the index of the characters so that the first letter printed is at position/index 0) 

5. Exit

However, for over a year now, I haven't had the drive to do my own projects. I've learned Java through AP Computer Science and learned a bit of C# from working in Unity before, but it feels like I lost my motivation to get into coding again. I like art and want to work with graphics; I just don't have the proficiency in coding to not make me focus on how programming feels like such a drag.

&amp;#x200B;

And it not that I don't have an interest in it; I do. I just don't have a huge passion for it like I do with something like music, where I actually go out and compose and play music because I live off of that thrill in creating and interpreting pieces. I always feel frustrated when I want to do some project like create a game but I lose motivation because I don't know the commands for anything. I can break down my thought process into something codable, but spending 20 minutes to find and learn one command out of 10 just kills my motivation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I don't have the patience right now for this topic. I can spend hours, weeks, or months on a music piece or an art drawing without feeling frustrated because I can see progress being made. I feel constantly intrigued by what I learn. Even though I can make progress through programming, I still don't feel like I'm being rewarded, as if it were a waste of time. I end up just doing my homework instead because of being in programming limbo. Whether it's making a game or wanting to create computer animations, I just end up saying ""forget about it"" and stop programming.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel greedy and impatient; I want the end result of a project, but I don't feel motivated to even get a quarter of the way through. I just don't know where to begin. What can I do to change this?

So you want to learn to code or become a software engineer but dont know where to start? Below Ill be breaking down the 3 main ways to learn when youre just getting started.

If you prefer video format, make sure to check out this video below:

https://youtu.be/FdguW3EkbD0

The first avenue of learning how to code is getting the traditional undergrad degree. You can get any type of tangential tech degree that involves coding (electrical and computer engineering, robotics, etc), but the most straightforward way to becoming a software engineer is to get a computer science degree.

With a traditional degree, you get out of college with a potentially large network of peers that you can keep in contact with throughout your career. This can help you with jobs, advice, and other opportunities. Also, large companies will most likely come to your career fair specifically in order to seek out students for internships. This can increase your chances of getting experience during college, before your first full time job.

A huge drawback is that colleges dont usually teach the most up to date skills. Most computer science degrees are very theory driven, and chances are you wont come out with hot skills like web development, data science, or AI, unless youve done some learning on your own.

The second way of learning is by going to a coding bootcamp. Most bootcamps are focused on web development. This is the avenue that I took after finishing college with an Industrial Engineering. I found that the coding bootcamp really fit my learning style, and was one of the best investments Ive ever made in my life thus far. These bootcamps are generally 3 months long, can be competitive to get into, and are generally geared towards people trying to make a career change.

With a coding bootcamp, and major plus is that theyre created with small groups of students in mind for the best learning experience. Bootcamps also can iterate much quicker than traditional educational institutions, so they are much more on top of teaching in demand skills in the industry. They provide arguably the best environment to learn how to code as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Coding bootcamps can require a large upfront cost to get into. Less bootcamps in 2019 are offering the model where you pay after getting your first job. These bootcamps also are not certified educational institutions, which could be a turnoff for some. Lastly, you will most likely have to drop everything (including a job) for 3 months in order to go to a bootcamp. While some offer part time remote bootcamps, these can take up to a year to complete. Its much more efficient to do the 80 hour a week, 3-month route.

The final avenue you can take is the self-taught route. 

This route is great because its free or low cost. There are so many online resources you can use to supplement your teaching. Another thing to consider is that you will need this skill anyway if you pursue this career path. Gone are the days when education is over after you get out of school  youll need to be consistently learning to stay up with trends and new technology throughout your career.

Some cons of this route are that there is no structure or external pressure provided. You are really on your own. This is potentially the longest of the three avenues to becoming a software engineer. The hardest part is that you dont know what you dont know, and theres nothing guiding you in the seemingly infinite world of technology. The final and biggest con is the confidence issue. The hardest part of technology (in my opinion) is not the technical aspect, but the confidence part. Imposter syndrome is real, and when it hits, youll have nobody to talk to or relate to. Youll need to find someone to relate to, whether its an in-person or online community. 

Overall, there are many avenues you can pursue depending on your stage and life and financial position. I would recommend for anyone younger to think about getting a college degree or going straight to a coding bootcamp. If youve already pursued a different career path and want to make the switch, start with the self-taught route to see if coding is for you, and then go into a coding bootcamp. If you already have external mentors, or other people who can guide you, go the self-taught route. But youll need some kind of reference to keep you on course throughout the journey. This is just my advice, but depending on your situation, feel free to do whatever suits your needs, learning styles, etc. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",35,74,False,self,,,,,

Practically, I know I suck. 

Basically the professor for the senior team project class told us that we are going to fail if we can't get any functionality. Doesn't matter that I've written more for that class than in any English class I've taken. Doesn't matter that 2/6 dropped out of the class, and one person barely communicates and has only really helped with some database population. The other two people are doing alright imo but they are working exclusively on the front-end. I am the only person who is even thinking of how to implement algorithms using the database. Doesn't matter that I found a way to implement the major algorithm, the professor said I can't use a simplified database that I designed to do the algorithm at least in its simplest form and that I have to use the database that ""has been accepted by the group"" made by someone who dropped out that has what I can define in one table scattered among 9ish tables. Some of the parts of the database I don't even understand because he didn't provide any example data. I can't even figure out how to begin to get a data pipeline to the web server. I am still fixing the database he made because some of the tables didn't have primary keys. I would be completely lost if I didn't take a databases class as an elective. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, my professor skipped one of our Friday weekly meetings that had pretty much become routine without any warning or apology thereafter, and had done the same a few weeks earlier. Would've really helped knowing they'd be livid if I used my own database I created and spent 8 hours implementing an algorithm with it that'd be a huge waste. Took 2-3 emails for them to appropriately respond to a ""I'm fine with any time for a personal meeting, just tell me a time that works for you"" email. And they have the audacity to say that I'm not ready for the workforce, like the workforce is all SWDE. 

&amp;#x200B;

They cite that ""I should of learned all this in a three credit class called 'intro to software engineering'"". Like a three credit class is enough to teach someone one the most lucrative skills in existence. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there we go. I can pass 117/120 credits required for a CS degree. I jumped through bigger hoops than people in most majors: calculus, linear algebra, chemistry, programming, operating systems, data structures and algorithms, databases, numerical analysis, theory of cs. But since I can't perform one of the most difficult and lucrative skills, I can't even graduate college. I should've just took the easy road and gotten a business degree.

Thing is I know I suck and probably need to look for work outside of CS. But unless and I start over and switch majors I am at a huge disadvantage for not even graduating college.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

Id like to automate the scraping to update each value periodically, but if there was a button that initiated the process and could return the qty in stock from 5 vendors for 10 different part numbers I can live with that. 

Right now I have the front-end login/registration and index page built using node to authenticate.   I just started the web scraping process with Python and got it working for 2 sites. But it hit me (poor planning) that Im not sure how to encapsulate the data back into the web app.

First, no Western country is going to accept a 4-year ""inconsequential"" degree from a shithole university in a shithole like Iran. It would take at least an hour to explain what ""inconsequential"", or as it is in Persian, ""Kaarshenaasi Napeyvasteh"" (Kaarshenaasi means bachelor's degree, and naapeyvasteh means inconsequential) actually is. What I care about are the topics they teach in this 4-year inconsequential plan (it's inconsequential because once I get my associates, I take an exam, and I can go to a good college like the FUM, where I used to study English lit and French lit --- they were easy, and I suffered from bipolarity and couldn't focus so my doctor said to enroll in them --- or go to any university I like). This community college is called JDM, and it's not FUM, but it has 5 research centers, a nice campus, nice girls (a lot of girls study SE and AE there), it's cheap, it doesn't require me to take the national entrance exam, and of course, it's 2 blocks from our house. I don't have a license because my eyes are a bit screwed, and I commuting is very important to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second concern is the teachers. Who are they? I've heard they're very young. In fact, I've heard only a handful of teachers there have offices in-building. The rest are what is called in Persian ""hagh-ol-zahmeh"" (pay for effort). They are like contractors. Do I really want to be taught by contractors? The trouble is, **I don't need to be taught anything.** I have been programming since I was 15, I have read Stewart's Calc, Epp's DiscMath, and Strange's LinALg. My focus is graphics, and its reverse, vision, and learning, as far as it's concerned with vision. But I really need a degree. Here, without a degree, you're nothing. And if I wish to immigrate, without a degree, I can't do anything. And if I wish to freelance, a lot of people prefer to hire someone with at least a bachelor's. 

&amp;#x200B;

My third concern is with the students I have to live with for 2 years. Are they smart? I doubt so. Are they fun to be with? I doubt so. Are they girls a bunch of stuck up prudes?  I guess so. I don't think it'll be the FUM experience I had with English lit.

&amp;#x200B;

And my main concern: should I get a 2-year degree, or a 4-year degree? I'm too old for this shit...

I am currently a sophomore in CS. At my accredited university, the only way to get the ABET accreditation for a CS degree is to take what is called the Systems/Scientific Applications concentration. This concentration makes me take higher level math, such as Calculus 2, Linear Algebra, Intro to Math Model, Physics courses, and a few more. The concentration is  one or two classes away for a minor in math. Without the concentration, Calculus 1, Discrete Math, and a statistics course. I could do the concentration, and come out with a minor in math after an extra class or two.

Math does not come naturally to me. I really enjoy it, but it takes much more effort for me to understand math over other subjects. I eventually understand it with tutoring and much more studying than I do for other subjects.

My questions to the people in the CS field: 

1. Does an ABET accredited degree matter? Remember, my university is still accredited as a whole, it is not a degree factory.
2. Regardless of the acccredition's value, would it be beneficial for me to take the concentration anyways? Would it possibly give me an advantage over other job candidates or allow me to be more proficient in CS? 

I have some friends who are a little further along than me in CS, my advisor, and my professor. The general consensus was that I should not do the concentration.

Im on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues.

I would really appreciate your guidance as I start to learn about computer science, particularly robotics. Some background info: I am a mother of three, 29 years old, Im educated and have my MA in Linguistics. Ten years ago I was pretty computer savvy, but after ten years of staying at home with my kids, I mostly use my computer for browsing the web.

My oldest son lives with his father on a different continent due to a very difficult custody battle but we have always video chatted or talked on the phone staying in touch. Sometimes we will share screens and do games or basic coding practice. 

I have him for summer and winter break. Weve always played a lot of video games together and weve done scratch coding  and a little bit of python since he is starting to type better. Hes very bright and always wants to learn more.

Hes become increasingly interested with robotics and considers himself an inventor, which I love and want to encourage. My hopes are that I can teach myself and be there for guidance as he starts to delve more and more into computer science. I want to be able to help him and learn with him.

So my questions is, where do I begin? What is my path in learning with my hopes are to help him with robotics as he gets older and things get more complicated. What should I encourage him with if he wants to invent and create?

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Dazion and I am currently at the end of my spring semester in college taking an Intro to C++ Programming course that I solely signed up for only because I THOUGHT i wanted to pursue a career in computer programming ( I digress). For the final project of this course however, I am having some serious problems trying to figure out how to correctly  compile my program so that I can get an A on this project and prevent from getting an absolute trash grade overall. Below will be what the project is asking for me to do as well as the code that I have so far (which is not much since I'm clueless as to what to do next lol). I'm pleading to anybody that sees this post and who is seasoned in this type of thing for your guidance in this process for success because this class could literally be the death of me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Write a C++ program that prompts the user for a series of letters**. The program will read in the letters and print out which dictionary words can be made from the provided letters. The dictionary is provided as a text file.

In very general terms, determining if a given word can be made from the given letters will require counting how many distinct kinds of letters there are in the given letters and in the words.

For example, assume that the word bull is in the dictionary. The word bull contains 1 b character, 2 l characters, and 1 u character. Now say the input letters were alblldi. In alblldi, we have enough b characters for bull, since alblldi contains at least 1 b character. Similarily, alblldi, has enough l characters for bull, since alblldi contains at least 2 l characters. However, alblldidoes not haveat least 1 u character, and as such we know that wecannot makebull from alblldi.

**Dictionary file**

Read in the dictionary words from a file. The name of the dictionary file must be dictionary.txt. Make the following assumptions about the dictionary file:

1. Each line contains the words that begin with particular letter.
2. The words in each line are separated by tab (\\t).
3. Each word consists only of lowercase letters in the range a-z.
4. The maximum length of a single line is 99 characters.
5. The maximum number of words is 1000.
6. If you cannot open the dictionary file, you should print Failed to open dictionary file dictionary.txt, followed by a newline, and then exit the program.

**Program requirements**

The program must meet the following requirements:

1. The program keeps asking the user for letters until the letters are exit.
2. The program prints words in the dictionary that could be made in alphabetic order, as specified in the dictionary.
3. The program prints out what letters were typed in, followed by a colon (:), followed by a list of the words that could be made (if any).
4. Each word that could be made is prefixed by a tab character (\\t).
5. If the user types an upper case letter your program must convert it to lower case.
6. Your program must check if each character is a valid letter of the English alphabet, if it is not then that character is discarded.

**Program output**

For instance, the following would be some output from your program:

enter letters: alblldi

alblldi:

 ball

 bill

enter letters: moo

moo:

enter letters: bleppa

bleppa:

 ape

 apple

enter letters: exit

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I have created two arrays (one for the letters of the file i have to access and one for the words that the file contains), a token pointer so that i can tokenize each word i enter so that the file can possibly find the word that fits the information the user inputted, and the actual opening of the file. I know that I need to have some type of ""for"" loop to count have many a's, b's etc that I entered and somehow relate it to the file information, and I know that i need to use a switch for this loop ( i know that that process is the key to the solution), but the problem is i don't know exactly how or when to incorporate that into my code. Plus, for some reason you'll see that i have the correct file (""dictionary.txt""), but it doesn't read the file how it's supposed to and is instead printing out ""Failed to open"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My actual Code:

\#include &lt;iostream&gt;

\#include &lt;cstring&gt;

\#include &lt;fstream&gt;

using namespace std;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

int main()

{

const int ARRAY\_SIZE = 26;

const int TEXT\_SIZE = 99;

&amp;#x200B;

char words\[TEXT\_SIZE\];

char letters\[TEXT\_SIZE\];

char \*TokenPtr;

&amp;#x200B;

int count = 0;

ifstream infile;

&amp;#x200B;

[infile.open](https://infile.open)(""dictionary.txt"");

&amp;#x200B;

if (!infile)

{

cout &lt;&lt; ""File open failure!"";

}

&amp;#x200B;

else

{

cout &lt;&lt; ""Enter a series of letters: "";

cin.getline(letters, TEXT\_SIZE);

}

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

/\*

TokenPtr = strtok(words, "" "");

&amp;#x200B;

while ( TokenPtr != NULL)

{

cout &lt;&lt; TokenPtr &lt;&lt; endl;

TokenPtr = strtok(NULL, "" "");

}

\*/

&amp;#x200B;

infile.close();

&amp;#x200B;

return 0;

}

&amp;#x200B;

The project is not due until April 28th but since I'm clueless I know for a fact I can't cram it in right before it's due so to any beautiful soul that's willing to assist me, I would veryyyy much appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of these are related to biology and computer vision. Personally, I am very interested in CV so it is a great opportunity for me to work on something like this so that I can improve my career prospects and get some real exposure into the field apart from some projects.

(Weird question I know),https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/bdc05a/uf_vs_ucla_undergrad_weird_question_i_know/,OlayColay,1555302844,"I'm a high school senior that lives in FL and I've narrowed down my college choice to two very different CS schools. I'm really torn as to where I want to go and I would appreciate any advice! I've recently visited both campuses for UF Days and Bruin Day respectfully and I was very impressed with both events. I'll give some other thoughts that I gathered too.

&amp;#x200B;

UF:

\++ Almost costless for me (because of in-state, Bright Futures scholarship, and FL Prepaid)

\+ Very close to home

\+ Big class size and lots of clubs &amp; orgs

\+ Gainesville is no Silicon Valley but it looks like there are some good internship opportunities from locals and tech giants alike (I'm more interested in internships rather than research if I had to choose for the moment

\+ Engineering ""Living Learning Community"" dorm in East Hall. It'd be cool to live with fellow nerds I guess  \\\_()\_/ 

\~ I've heard of some issues with the professors, but also heard that the situations have improved over the past couple of years

\~ I'd have some friends from high school but I also kind of wanted to get away from my high school life at the same time

\- I'm sick of the muggy Florida weather but at least the dorms at UF all have ac

\- There's a lack of promotion of CS (at least in FL Days) it seems like. There was only one short presentation for engineering in general. Contrast this to when I talk about Bruin Day below.

&amp;#x200B;

UCLA:

\++ Silicon Valley/Beach is obviously a great place for getting internships for CS.

\+ Big class size and lots of clubs &amp; orgs

\+ Clean slate from high school as I don't know of anyone in my school that's going there.

\+ Did a phenomenal job of promoting CS at the Engineering Bruin Day. There was a 2 hr presentation and QA session given by both professors and students just for CS and CE! I even got to have lunch with a 4th-year student and an alum that was a former Vice President of SanDisk, both of them offering exceptional advice.

\+ Prestige of UCLA. I'm honored to be able to go to either of these schools, but I know that UCLA is highly regarded when it comes to CS in the workforce.

\+ Campus is gorgeous. I know it doesn't really matter but wow, it would be hard to get depressed with the views and this weather.

\~ There's no ac in some dorms, but the weather is good enough so that you can open a window and be fine.

\-- The out-of-state costs. I won't go into detail, but I'd probably end up being around $100k total in debt. The six-figure starting salaries could make relatively short work of that, but it's enticing to go to a good uni like UF with no debt instead.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR UF is low-cost but UCLA seems to have the better program

I am not demanding anyone go out and do this right away, but I work in product marketing at a company and a good deal of my work deals with content marketing as well. This means editing videos.

A bit about the company I work for - the way we make videos is we brainstorm, record, then edit our videos and put our products in, but sometimes we'll take the video and edit it and re-render it as many as ten times because of the relevant departments giving us their input - Corporate marketing, engineering, and quality assurance departments. We have to check a lot of boxes before we put it on YouTube.

The main issue is that whenever we rerender a video it often times takes ten minutes to finish rendering before we show it to the department that may not approve of it.

So, I guess what I'm proposing is someone create a new video file format that can detect only a few seconds of the original video that is being re-rendered that have been edited and then just, ""skip rendering and just rewrite the parts of the video that did change.""

Does this make sense? So like I have company_video.mp4 (render time ten minutes, 25 seconds), my supervisor doesn't like the ending, so I go through and rerender company_video.mp4's ending, and when rerendering it only takes 5 seconds because I'm only changing the ending (theoretical render time 5 seconds).

I replied the text in quotes after the next paragraph : 

**What are your thoughts on this particular question? Let us not look at books and discuss. I feel this is a question that we've all had at least during our programming paths** :) 

""""""
Okay, let me tell you what I feel is a project.So, during an online test for a job application, there was a problem statement that asked us to find urls from within an html file.Say the input is : `&lt;a href=""`[`https://www.google.com/search`](https://www.google.com/search)`""&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;`

The output should be : [`https://www.google.com/search`](https://www.google.com/search)

Now, the solutions that were submitted, that did this task are **programs.**

Next. I worked on an application as the algorithm developer, coder and UI designer of a project called Alfaload. This was a web and android application where if you input the name of the file, the type of the file, it will search the web and download the file for you. Example : name - Google Search. file type - android application(apk).

This application(made well before the job application exam :P) had the solution to the problem statement. I developed the algorithm that crawled the webpage, extracted the link and then returned the link to the user.

Now, for the android application - it had the UI element, the module that extracted links, the module that crawled the pages(hosted on a remote server - we don't want to exhaust the datacap of the user now, do we?), the UI elements, some error checking, some exploit prevention, etc etc. This is a project. A project is a collection of many programs, that aims to solve a problem or achieve a goal, each module / program dependent on each other, working towards a common goal.

The final application which we upload to the Google Play Store is the **product.**

The work in progress, where we developed the application is the **project.**

The individual modules - **programs.**

\--------------------------------------

Flappy bird is a great starter project. You will come to know about many aspects of an Android application, like graphics, animation, event handling, exception handling, passing data between activities and optionally-connecting to the server(if you plan on having a leaderboards system).Do it, don't be afraid of a project. Once you install Android Studio and get a hang of it, there is no one in this world who can stop you from making the best application in the world.

There are plenty of guides online that will help you with your first, second and many more projects to come! and the Google official documentation is always there at your disposal!

And nothing is **too**  ambitious. Always know the limits that currently bar you from breaking through. Identify them, work on them and achieve what you dream to achieve. 

Cheers! I hope my answer is adequate ! :)

I'm in a real struggle to choose between UT Austin and UC Berkeley for their computer science programs. 

UT is in state for me and would save me a lot of money but I like Berkeley so much better. I visited both campuses and Berkeley's tech environment and amazing California weather really stood out to me. Also, Berkeley is well ranked above UT for CS. 

UT would cost about 120k for me for a CS major, Business minor and Entrepreneurship certificate and Berkeley would be about 200k where I could realistically graduate within 3 years with a CS major and a Technology Entrepreneurship certificate.

Just to give you an idea, my future career goals is to be in Robotics as a Software Developer. I browsed the courses in both colleges and Berkeley has way more courses that go so in depth with the Robotics and AI material. 

Lastly, I don't know if it matters but at Berkeley, the CS degree is a BA program where at Austin it's a BS degree even though I would be taking some electrical engineering courses and more CS courses at Berkeley. Does the BA degree really matter to companies?

Also Berkeley is in the Bay Area sooo yeah.

So my brother has this wooden rail track that you can assemble. There are different pieces that are either turning rails or just straight rails. I would like to make a program where I could input the number of the different rails I have, and have it generate a random combination so that I can assemble it in real life.

I would also need to include the amount of room the algorithm can use, as my room isn't too big. The track would also have to connect with the very first rail to make it circular so that it loops around and there's no definite end.

Here is an image of the rails I am talking about.

Additionally, there is a FB internship that you can apply for in the fall as long as you know one coding language. I know I am behind but want to work towards this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for an online course to do over the summer to learn. I found Cs50 on [edx.org](https://edx.org) which is free but also comes with a certificate for (90). There are other classes with similar fees for a certificate. I will not be applying to a job soon but do you think the certificate would help my application to a CS internship or demonstrate passion when I apply to change majors? Or should I do it for free?

&amp;#x200B;

I saw some boot camps but it is too far from where I live and a lot more expensive so online resources would be best. I guess my question is, whats the best way to learn coding languages and programming this summer that is free or cost efficient. Should I seek certification? If not, how should i proceed is showing that i self-taught myself?

Lastly, I was thinking of learning Python first and prioritizing it since it seems like the most common? What is the best language to put first to help my chances for the FB internship and further down the line when I learn other languages and immerse myself in the CS world?

So, I'm almost a undergraduate junior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I've taken several computer science and programming courses, as listed on my resume below. I'm looking into internships and applying to the ones I have at least some of the requirements for. A few questions, what projects am I allowed to put on my resume? Do school projects count?

For instance, in my C# Desktop Applications with WinForms class, I created a program which had a user login to a database, and once they logged in it was a new form that listed four other programs I wrote (all of this was for a final project), and those programs consisted of:

1. FTP Program which added, removed, and view files in a FTP server
2. A program which allowed you to view detailed information and specifications on your current device's hardware
3. A program which, while syncing was on, would sync two directories simultaneously if the source directory would be changed
4. A fully equipped Rich Text Editor program, which included printing and all.

Also, for my game programming course I made a Universal Windows Platform Isometric 2D attack game with an engine that my professor was writing (few bugs in the game but nothing major, I know that some employers look more at the structure of the code, etc.). In my discrete mathematics course, one of our programs was to write our own path finding implementation using A\* algorithm. More projects made in other courses too.

So, can projects like these be added to my resume since they weren't simple ""print hello world"" programs?

Also, can anyone give me any tips on my resume that companies hiring for interns would want to and not want to see? I hear a lot about keeping the resume one page, but with my few jobs in Information Technology listing what I have done, references, skills, etc., it was hard to get it to a single page without leaving information out.

Page 1 and page 2 of my resume are linked below (black blobs are just covering up personal information). Thanks everyone, I appreciate the help :)

""Introduction to organization of modern digital computers - understanding the various components of a computer and their interrelationships. Study of a specific architecture/machine with emphasis on systems programming in C and Assembly languages in a UNIX environment.

**Course Objectives:**

This course gives an introduction to computer organization of modern digital computers, from the basic stored program model attributed to John von Neumann in the 1940s. The influence of these principles can be found in almost every computer which is in use these days, and they will lead the student to an understanding of the various components of a computer and their inter-relationships. We will use a specific machine to study computer architecture at the assembly language and C interface level. We are currently using Sun workstations and their SPARC series microprocessor to familiarize students with machine-oriented programming. Efficient and portable high-level language software engineering is achieved by understanding comparative architecture-dependent implementations of various constructs and mechanisms, such as stack frame implementation within the runtime environment (text/data/BSS/ heap/stack) and internal storage representations (including byte ordering and number of bytes of an object on different architectures). Programming assignments using C and assembly languages with some emphasis on UNIX systems programming will be used to reinforce these concepts.""",4,0,False,self,,,,,

[http://www-imai.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/\~yato/data2/MasterThesis.pdf](http://www-imai.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yato/data2/MasterThesis.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To avoid backtracking, I've generated an algorithm with some research into a polynomial time algorithm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm looking for constructive-criticism, improvement, recommendations, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I've found out that if I control all parameters in the creation of a Sudoku puzzle I can generate the puzzle from a solution in quadratic time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the summary of the entire description of the algorithm. Before you get into your reading.**

&amp;#x200B;

 *Step 1 Follow the grid and puzzle generation method(mentioned at the end of the question).*

 *Step 2 Enter for input l to generate a solution before generating the*

 *puzzle \[8,5,9,6,1,2,4,3,7\]*

*Step 3. Now generate the puzzle  Example- Take the output of the complete grid and compare to the world's hardest sudoku puzzle and arrange the elements in some algorithm(paper or computer) to match the below.*

 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1 of the Algorithm is written in Python.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\--

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

`n = 0`

`l = input('Enter the first solved box to get a correct solution')`



`note when script asks for input you must write it like this`



`[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`

  

`indices = []`

`for i in xrange(1, 1+len(l)):`

`indices.append(n % i)`

`n //= i`

`indices.reverse()`



`perm = l`

`for index in indices:`

`perm.append(l.pop(index))`

`print(perm)`

&amp;#x200B;

2nd part of algorithm not yet implemented in the script

&amp;#x200B;

To convert the result(which is an horizontal solution) into human readable format follow this method.

&amp;#x200B;

You take the first three rows from the output

&amp;#x200B;

**\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\]**



**\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\]**



**\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\]**

&amp;#x200B;

and do this.... Line them up one by one side by side in this order and I'm seemingly always getting correct grids!!

&amp;#x200B;

\*Yeah, I know this isn't in right order but just to show illustration\*

&amp;#x200B;

**\[1,2,3\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[4,5,6\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[7,8,9\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**-**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[1,2,3\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[4,5,6\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[7,8,9\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**-**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[1,2,3\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[4,5,6\]**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[7,8,9\]**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an actual output of a solution in horizontal format.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5\]**



**\[6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9\]**



**\[1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6\]**



**\[2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1\]**



**\[4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2\]**



**\[3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4\]**



**\[7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3\]**



**\[8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7\]**



**\[5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8\]**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Following the aforementioned method.

&amp;#x200B;

You get a correct Sudoku grid. (The checker says its correct every time I've ran it) I've taken out some elements to see if there's a puzzle with 1 solution and behold.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\[9 6 1\]\[2 4 3\]\[7 8 5\]



\[2 4 3\]\[7 8 5\]\[9 6 1\]



\[7 8 5\]\[9 6 1\]\[2 4 3\]



\[6 1 2\]\[4 3 7\]\[8 5 9\]



\[4 3 7\]\[8 5 9\]\[6 1 2\]



\[8 5 9\]\[6 1 2\]\[4 3 7\]



\[1 2 4\]\[3 7 8\]\[5 9 6\]



\[3 7 8\]\[5 9 6\]\[1 2 4\]



\[5 9 6\]\[1 2 4\]\[3 7 8\]

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

`Pseudo-code`

&amp;#x200B;

`Python2.7`

&amp;#x200B;

`&gt;&gt;&gt;World-s hardest Sudoku puzzle converted in vertical format`

&amp;#x200B;

`800000000003600000070090200050007000000045700000100030001000068008500010090000400`



`Manipulating your generated grid to match index by index of hardest puzzle. (This is making sure there should only be 1 solution)`



`961243785612437859124378596243785961437859612378596124785961243859612437596124378`

&amp;#x200B;

`Poof!! string manipulation done in linear time.`

`900000000002400000020070500040005000000059600000500020005000043009600030090000300`

&amp;#x200B;

(warning manual typos will happen if done by hand)

&amp;#x200B;

Converting into correct format with one solution only(supposedly)

&amp;#x200B;

\-- Solve this. Warning I've probably got typos. Remember the one by one ordering?

&amp;#x200B;

900 040 050

000 005 000

000 000 430



002 000 096

400 000 000

000 059 300



020 005 900

070 000 003

500 100 000

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Since, I've made sure that the grids are always correct. I checked an online Sudoku checker. Generating Complete Grids. Even the puzzles are seemingly always generated correctly in quadratic time.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not enough testing has confirmed if every puzzle generated from this algorithm is correct, \*but every grid has been correct so far if you actually follow the method correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what? 

&amp;#x200B;

**There is no polynomial-time algorithm to check if the puzzle you've generated has a unique solution (unless P = NP)-**[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6924216/how-to-generate-sudoku-boards-with-unique-solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6924216/how-to-generate-sudoku-boards-with-unique-solutions)

I'm a first year, going to second year Math and Compsci student.
I was chosen for this scholarship that basically gives you a paid 3 month long internship at any (computer science) research facility of my choice (located at my uni, of course)

There are some interesting facilities at my university, but the two that appealed to me the most were: one research center about Natural Language Processing and one about Quantum Computing.

The one about NLP seems like an 'easier' internship because I already have a bit of a base in Python and know some concepts that are related to data science.

The one about quantum computing, however, is more appealing. But it also seems like the kind of thing that would be so hard to understand that I would feel lost throughout the whole internship. My knowledge in quantum phenomenon is very limited to Grade 12 physics classes, and I am super scared to just be way too lost. HOWEVER I don't know when I'd get a chance to be in this research center again (this scholarship is making it easy for me to get in but they normally as super picky about their candidates), not to mention the head of research there is a super known guy, one of the ""founding fathers"" in quantum computing - Wolfe Prize winner Gilles Brassard.

We would be very grateful for any advice or opinions on which technologies would be best suited for our project. Below is some information regarding the project.

This will begin as a web app, but in the future should be fully accessible from iOS and Android Applications.

At the absolute highest level, here is what our application will be doing/what it must be able to handle with grace:

Make and receive many phone calls throughout the day

1. We will be using Twilios APIs for these calls
2. On average, we anticipate needing to handle \~25-100 concurrent phone calls at all times  

   1. We also need to handle intermittent, and much less frequent, bursts of hundreds of concurrent phone calls, possibly even thousands.
3. The large, large majority of these phone calls will require at least 1, but typically more, database queries. (we intend to use a relational database on the backend)  

   1. So, while we arent too worried about kicking off a ton of concurrent phone calls, we are very worried about the person on the other end being held up due to these DB connections/queries getting backed up. Data being queried is mission critical, and must be available nearly instantly.
4. Automatically update all relevant pages of the web apps UI every time a phone call leads to changing or adding a row somewhere in the DB
5. Automatically update all relevant pages of the web apps UI every time a user makes a change through the web app rather than through the phone.

Essentially, we have a large-ish application that will be initiating and receiving phone calls, using many DB connections and performing a lot of queries, etc, but will require very little CPU. Most of the data being passed around will require very few operations to be performed on it before being entered into the DB.

For some prototyping weve been using the following:

1. a free-tier server from AWS
2. a free-tier MySQL DB from AWS
3. For the backend code that will be running on the server, we are currently using Python

Weve been looking into ORMs to use, but weve been seeing mixed opinions and have read that they may potentially slow things down, which again we want to avoid when we have many users sitting on phone calls. Down the road, we believe were going to want to execute some raw SQL. Would this be an issue if using an ORM? How much would this complicate things?

We plan to use a connection pool for the database connections, but this is also something neither of us has any experience with. We understand there are packages built into python to help handle such pools, but is there any reason we should maybe be implementing our own here?  
If anyone has any suggestions as to whether these technologies would be suited for our needs, or if anyone has a suggestion of a better technology(s) than what we're currently using, we would appreciate it greatly!",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Here's the pseudo code. Binary search O log n?

`tuple=[.......]`

`tuple=[.......]`

`indefinite all possible sudoku grids.`

`Here's our solver.`

`solver = input('enter the puzzle like this 10000030004000...)`

`if Element with Same Index solver == tuple1, tuple2,...`

`print (solution containing exact elements that share the indexes in both the solution and puzzle)`

Here the solver goes over in **linear time(inefficiently)** of every possible Sudoku puzzle in fixed shift and checks the index elements of 1,3,4... and ounce it matches a solution grid in the shifts it solves in linear time.

Suppose, we have S for infinity amount of subset sums in fixed tuples.

**C = constraint environment**

**S in C = P**

**P = C**

Now, suppose we deduce a **np-complete problem** entirely in a constraint system with all possible ""shift"" tuples defined that are executed in linear time(albeit inefficiently)

If a np class can be constrained and deduced into **pseduo-polynomial** algorithm entirely

**(eg. infinite amount of pre-defined shifts for sub-set)**

Then,

**P=CNP**

Now, this does not mean P=NP or P does not NP. It means, that I can constrain certain parts of sets and solve it in poly time. Possibly, I'm wrong.(most likely)

&amp;#x200B;

To see, what I did to test my approach. **And, it does work.** When I define certain constraints I am able to semi-solve some Sudoku puzzles in seemingly quadratic time

[Final solution in quadratic time for 9! amount of Sudoku puzzles following this method of generation.](https://i.redd.it/8hgvnh7pwpt21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The End result of my 3 week endeavor at trying to solve P vs NP. 

&amp;#x200B;

Result-

&amp;#x200B;

I found out that creating constraints in limited puzzles can be semi-solved in seemingly poly time. 

Because of computational resources problem there is no known way possible to generate all Sudoku grids efficiently.  Until, then if an algorithm does exist that solves all possible Sudoku puzzles its probably so large and inefficient it won't be recognized as ""proof"" until a mathematical proof says it is.

For the pseudo-code to  be tested I need to find an efficient way of generating all possible grids that won't take more time than the entire universe!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I believe I was not able to solve p vs np. It was fun as an amateur enthusiast. 

 Since, I can't mount such a computationally expensive route of defining all pre-sets of Sudoku solutions in a python script. I have to try to show that it some can be solved in an algorithm.

Hi I am currently a sophomore who just recently found out about USACO. I've been looking into it for the past few days and I have a couple of questions.

1. What are the best resources (websites, books, etc.) I should prepare from? I looked at the USACO Training Gateway but even the initial problems on that were a bit too hard for me. Should I use websites like TopCoder, HackerRank, CodeChef, SPOJ, PEG, etc. or is there a better alternative way? Keep in mind that I have very limited competitive programming skills and should probably start from the very basics. I'd also be willing to buy books and other materials.
2. What language would you recommend to use? I know a little bit of Java but if it is worth it I would be willing to learn C++ as those are what I've noticed to be the two most common languages.
3. How realistic is it for me to aim at making the Gold/Platinum divisions in the 2020 contests? On weekdays I could probably put in 1-2 hours on average and weekends around 4-6 hours. I've read that Silver is relatively easy to qualify for but obviously the upper levels must be quite competitive.",2,8,False,self,,,,,

I have the indices and vertices of a 3D mesh, and I want to voxelise it in C++. I've found [a ready-to-use header that implements Triangle Box Intersection efficiently](https://gist.github.com/jflipts/fc68d4eeacfcc04fbdb2bf38e0911850), and read in the accompanying paper that it can be used for voxelisation. However, even after researching the topic, I don't really understand how I'm meant to use it.

[Here is my mesh data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JfVqq_560S_2Q6-36lgcYDFKxL-lTtSB/view?usp=sharing). It has additional and currently irrelevant information, but I think only vertices and indices are needed for this task.

What I have in mind so far is that I make a 3 dimensional array that represents the object, where each element is a boolean indicating whether the voxel is part of the object and its index in the array being the relative location of the voxel. Inside a triple nested loop, I would be using the header to test for the presence of the object in the voxel, but I'm really confused as to how I'm meant to use it.

Am I going about this the wrong way? If not, how am I meant to use it?",1,1,False,self,,,,,

[Here is the python script of generating grids before mapping them out into valid grids and it solves it by supplying the lower right 9 after mapping it out.](https://i.redd.it/9re1c28934u21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, lets prove one more time that the Sudoku Grid Generator/Solver is the P class. Here, I demonstrate 3 different grids.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*l = \[8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7\]\*\*



        [5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8]-l1

        [1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6]-l4
        [2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1]-l5
        [4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2]-l6
        [3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4]-l7
        [7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3]-l8
        [8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7]-l9



   \*\*x = \[5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8\]\*\*

   

        [9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5]-x1
        [6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9]-x2
        [1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6]-x3
        [2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1]-x4
        [4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2]-x5
        [3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4]-x6
        [7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3]-x7
        [8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7]-x8
        [5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8]-x9

   

   \*\*y = \[9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5\]\*\*



        [6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9]-y1
        [1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6]-y2
        [2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1]-y3
        [4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2]-y4
        [3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4]-y5
        [7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3]-y6
        [8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7]-y7
        [5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8]-y8
        [9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5]-y9

&amp;#x200B;

By following the listing I demonstrate below that a special permute of 9 unique elements mentioned in the link are all eloquently connected in my algorithm. \*Therefore, this constrained Sudoku Algorithm must be in P class.\*

&amp;#x200B;

To understand the boolean operations one must understand that the algorithm is a simple 3x3 circular shift allowing the constrained grids to follow Sudoku rules.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets give an example on how the booleans operate.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(l1  x9  y8)  (l2  x1  y9)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; l1 = \[5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8\]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; x9 = \[5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8\]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; y9 = \[5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8\]

&amp;#x200B;

Here, I proved that every tuple generated is following 3x3 shift. The remaining expressions do the same.

&amp;#x200B;



    (l3  x2  y1)  (l4  x3  y2)
                
    (l5  x4 y3)  (l6  x5  y4)
                
    (l7  x6  y5)  (l8  x7  y6) 
                
    (l9  x8  y7)  (l1  x9  y8)  (l2  x1  y9) 
    

   

&amp;#x200B;

Intro to CS: C+
Data Structures: C
Calc 1: B-
Calc 2: C
Calc 3: B+
Linear Algebra: C
Discrete Math: C

Do I have any chance of getting into any good PhD programs with these grades? I'm highly interested specifically in the relationship between statistics and CS as probability is by far my favorite subject in Math.


I have the option of staying some extra time in Undergrad to expand my CS and Math knowledge. Currently looking into some Statistics based grad school classes and maybe after next year take a machine learning course(assuming I choose not to graduate I'm actually only about 2-3 semesters from graduating atm).

Is there a number I should aim for in the GREs that might compensate for my shit grades? Or is it not even worth trying.

My current look at this, as a CS student, is the following: I've encountered many things that seemed far less intuitive than P  NP which have been proven. When looking at some NP-complete problems, it seems almost obvious, that there exists no polynomial-time algorithm to solve them. Still, attempts to prove P  NP have failed in the past. There seems to be a divergence between the intuitive difficulty and actual difficulty of the proof.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to develop a better understanding for *why* it is so difficult to prove P  NP. This Quora [answer](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-P-not-equal-to-NP-so-hard-to-prove/answer/Ganapathy-Parthasarthy) says

&gt;The consensus seems to be that such a proof cannot be written using existing axiom systems.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to this community is whether there are any resources that deal with the question of *why* the proof is so hard to come up with, such that I, as a CS student, can spend time reading and understanding them, by traversing the dependency graph of the document/paper/blog to really fully understand it.

I hope this is the right subreddit for posting this kind of questions. If not please let me know and I will make corrections accordingly. 
I wont go into to many details in favor of brevity but don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear so that i can provide clarification.

Me and my partner are currently working on our undergraduate thesis in informations systems and need to find a scientific theory regarding a definition of ""Good code"".
Basically, a theory that we can use in order to define what makes software code and concepts good/suitable/useful. 

We wanted to do a deep-dive into the different programming paradigms and we selected Object-Oriented and Functional programming since these seem to be the most common and also because there seem to be some debate in which ones of these is the superior paradigm. What we plan to do is to understand the two paradigms, analyse the discussions (on for example reddit, stackoverflow and other forums) that make claims regarding the issues and benefits of the paradigms and then make our own contribution to the discussion in the form of an analysis of which paradigm would be more/less suitable for solving certain problems that have been found in discussions. 

So far the search for a theoretical framework has yielded poor results. There are a lot of opinions stated in blogs and books but no actually useful standards that are applied in practical scenarios when producing software. Any tips, suggestions or pointers to potential sources would be much appreciated.

I recently got accepted into two great computer science programs and needed help figuring which is better for me.

Both programs are geared toward students with zero computer science backgrounds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my options:

1. DePaul University: 6 prereq classes to catch up and then I would be able to take grad classes. They offer many interesting classes and the opportunity to do research and earn credits for any potential internships. Would take me about 3 years of classes. Will cost me about $64,000.
2. Northeastern University: I got into their ALIGN program. The program is entirely for students with zero CS experience.  They offer amazing research opportunities and a guaranteed Co-Op opportunity (an internship).  Would take me about 2.5 years of classes and a 4-6 month co-op experience. Will cost me about $73,000.

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. I intend to attend school in Fall 2020 so I have some time to decide.

There are other types of logic systems apart from classical logic, like paraconsistent logics or even trivialism, that allow these contradictions to occur, prove them as right and work with them.

We can make a paraconsistent or trivialist system and work with it. For example, with trivialism, in theory, we would be able to derive and state everything we would want (since literally everything, even including illogical/logically impossible inconsistencies and contradictions), but we as humans (or as brains), are limited and can't conceive everything we want (at least to what I know). Therefore, no matter how many trivialist models we create and how much time we would work with them, we would never find or conceive many illogical/logically things because they are just that: impossible. There are impossible things to describe and conceive. For example, Russel's set is the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. If Russel's set contains itself, then it cannot contain itself, since it only contains sets that don't contain themselves. But if Russel's set does not contain itself, then it must contain itself, since it contains all sets that don't contain themselves. There are quite a few logic bombs like this. You cannot ever compute the contents of Russel's set, and there are more formal, mathematical ways to present it. All of them have in common that you can't actually compute what the set is, whether you do it by hand, in your head, or on a computer. It's just a statement that cannot be fully logically processed. If you take every possible state the human brain can be in, none of them include the computation of Russel's Set's contents. That is, not only can the contents not be computed, they cannot even be represented. No stimulus can cause us to comprehend Russel's Set, since such comprehension is not possible to begin with. It does not have a solution. Even if we try to solve it using trivialism, we would just be able to write a solution that does not make sense and prove it has sense and it is the real solution, but we could not be able to have a solution that would make sense ""outside"" the realm of trivialism (for example in classical logic), even though, using trivialism, we could prove that such solution would have sense in whatever context and logic system.

But what about hypercomputational machines (for example oracle-like machines)? I've read about some models of hypercomputation which are compatible with paraconsistent or trivialism logics. I've also read there are some models of hypercomputation (particularly those oracle-like models which use a black box) where, essentially, the hypercomputer is an algorithm that cannot exist. It might be because such an algorithm is fundamentally forbidden by logic itself (which is hided in a black box). Would any of these be capable of computing/""conceiving"" these impossible things I wrote before? Do you know of anything that would help?",0,0,False,self,,,,,

As mentioned in the co-NP definition a decision problem ""X"" is a member of co-np if and only if its complement X is in the complexity class ""NP."" As said before, co-np is the class of problems for which a poly verifier can say no instances. The algorithm verifies no instances for grids. If it does not follow the circular language. It says, ""not a constrained puzzle."" Therefore, Constrained Sudoku is co-np.

&amp;#x200B;

 **In other words, co-NPis the class of problems for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can verify ""no"" instances -** [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-NP) 

&amp;#x200B;

According to this definition I have a poly-time checker for no instances.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming, that the cyclic language is maintained indefinitely.

&gt;Cyclic Permutation  
*let n = input*  
*let k = shift(L)*  
**Pn = (n-k)!**  
**(n-3)! == lim\_(n-&gt;) 3 = 3**  
In reduced form  
**(n - 3)! = n-&gt;-k**

## Pseudo-Code

    if indexes/elements match in grid and follows  shift(L) language:                                     
                                                          
                                   print ""yes"" 
    
    else:
                                         print ""no"" 

*Overall, is this sufficient proof that Constrained Sudoku is co-np?*

Given two choices my algorithm tests two valid Sudoku grids. One being a non-constrained and the other one being a constrained. It then verifies a no answer in poly time for the non-constrained.

    if indexes/elements match in grid and follows  shift(L) language:

Hi everyone!

i am doing a Thesis on computational complexity for my degree in computer science and am having slight issues with the accuracy of my statements.

i am trying to reduce from 3 partition (an np problem) to tiling (matching edge puzzles). and all my supervisor had to say about it was that "" There are some technical inaccuracies with the theoretical material, especially the more abstract, earlier parts, but probably not easy to fix in the limited time. "" which kinda has me slightly worried.

i am assuming that he means the section of where i perform my reduction. (pg 10) . but it might be the statements i had made about P and NP earlier (which confuses me since i used sources... did i misinterpret something???)

i would love for some assistance in my reduction(pg. 10+) , and if you can, just a quick read over the earlier material (pg.6 - 10).

thank you so much i appreciate you taking your time to read this.",0,0,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on a Sudoku Grid Generation Algorithm. I follow a shifting language that allows the creation of valid grids.

&amp;#x200B;

Example.

&amp;#x200B;

Unmapped Grid

&amp;#x200B;

        [8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7]-----list 1
        [7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3]-----list 2
        [3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4]-----list 3
        [4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2]-----list 4
        [2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1]-----list 5
        [1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6]-----list 6
        [6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9]-----list 7
        [9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5]-----list 8
        [5, 9, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8]-----list 9

&amp;#x200B;

Now, lets map it out showing the shift(L) language of 3x3 to generate valid 9x9 grid.

&amp;#x200B;

    **list1**  **list4**  **list7**
    
    **list2**  **list5**  **list8**
    
    **list3**  **list6**  **list9**
    

&amp;#x200B;

[Here is the 3x3 shift pattern.](https://i.redd.it/1bcgj6yo61v21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

I continued with larger grids as the shift increases to 4x3 for a 12 by 12 valid sudoku grid

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[4x3 shift pattern](https://i.redd.it/6w6fohcv81v21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now, for bigger illustration lets say I have a 50x50 Sudoku Grid  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The shift pattern will be 10x5.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Or lets say I want a 100x100 Sudoku Grid.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The shift pattern will be 10x10

&amp;#x200B;

Before, I share how I figured out the math works for an unlimited amount of grids I will share the algorithm written in python that generates the grids before mapping them out. And it also recovers the solutions when provided a correctly solved box

&amp;#x200B;

    n = 0
    l = input('Enter the lower right solved box to get a correct solution')
    
    indices = []
    for i in xrange(1, 1+len(l)):
            indices.append(n % i)
            n //= i
            indices.reverse()
    
            perm = l
    for index in indices:
            perm.append(l.pop(index))
            print(perm)

By using math, I found out the shift(L) language is not finite and applies to an infinite amount of valid Sudoku Grids.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let k = shift based on tuple length

let shift by shift be defined by the formula x by y

let x = length of valid and horizontal row within an individual n\*n Sudoku box 

&amp;#x200B;

Example

&amp;#x200B;

123

000

000

&amp;#x200B;

let y = length of valid and vertical row within n\*n Sudoku box

&amp;#x200B;

Example

&amp;#x200B;

100

200

300

&amp;#x200B;

Let t = length of a tuple with non repeating elements

&amp;#x200B;

let L = (t-k)! and x by y

&amp;#x200B;

If and only if, 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[t can have any length](https://i.redd.it/4xspdadqb1v21.png)

k is followed by x by y shift

&amp;#x200B;

then

&amp;#x200B;

L = 

&amp;#x200B;

In other words,  

&amp;#x200B;

L cannot be a finite language.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, if L is not a finite language then wouldn't it no longer be in P?",44,14,False,self,,,,,

The problem is that I can't open more than 15-18 Chrome tabs without it consuming 90% of my RAM. And then as soon as I open a slightly heavy desktop application like Slack or Skype or Postman, the computer freezes, FOR HOURS. What bothers me most is that on my previous Lenovo Windows laptop with only 4 GB RAM, I used to have like 3-4 Chrome windows open each with 8-10 different tabs whilst simultaneously working with super heavy IDE's like Android Studio and multiple desktop apps all running at the same time and it never once froze on me. Sure, the system would slow down a bit because I would keep it running for 2-3 days straight but it would never freeze abruptly like this.

I don't understand why there are such issues with a more powerful laptop with twice as much RAM capacity and a lighter OS like Ubuntu. As soon as I boot my system, almost half the RAM is already consumed. Then I open 10-12 Chrome tabs from my previous history, a running Apache server and a lightweight IDE like VS Code and that's pretty much the maximum load my laptop can handle. I try opening any other application after that, BOOM, the laptop's frozen again. I've tried everything to try and fix this. I even changed my DE from GNOME to Unity because I read somewhere that GNOME consumes a lot of RAM but to no avail. I can't seem to figure out what the problem is. Is Chrome taking up more memory than it needs to on Ubuntu? Or does this issue have nothing to do with Ubuntu but a hardware malfunction? Or is this totally normal and I need to cut down on the number of Chrome tabs and desktop applications I have running at the same time?

A little background. I am a new computer science student finishing up my first year of a two-year program with intentions to transfer into a bachelors program after I earn my associates. I have mostly only completed pre reqs so far and getting caught up on math as I have been out of high school for about 7 years and I was only preforming on a prealgebra level when I started. When I first declared my major to be computer science I had a misconception that it would be mostly hardware and networking stuff, or I guess I thought it would be closer to information technology(?) , but after learning what it really was I decided that it sounded awesome and that I did not want to switch my degree. It was going to originally take me about 4 years to complete my associates but now I'm on track to graduate in a normal 2 years pace.

&amp;nbsp;

Now for my dilemma. Most of the students that I am interacting with seem to be way ahead of me as far as their coding goes. I am with students that taught themselves 4+ coding languages in high school and honestly seem like they could get a job already. They only languages I know how to work with are HTML and CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript. I honestly just feel like I am so behind and I wonder if I am at a disadvantage here. What could I be doing to get ahead? Should I start learning python on my own, or Java? Half of these students have projects that they have made on their free time already and I don't, so should I start trying to create something?

My interviewer didnt show up for the first time. In our second session he asked me to design an autonomous car and thats all the talking he did. He showed no interest in giving hints or guidance or defining the scope of the question or being engaged in the interview in any way. After seeing me rambling for 10 minutes, clearly knowing nothing about autonomous driving, he changed the question to something I have experience with - design a recommender system.

I talked about everything I know related to recommender systems (from models to model deployment to dev ops). But still, no verbal communication at all for the next 50 minutes. I have no idea if I made a mistake or spent too much time talking about something or if I can elaborate more on that or just what is he exactly looking for. I just kept talking about things that I think are relevant.

And thats the end of the interview, he said I can read more about feature embeddings and thats all the feedback I got. I didnt get an email with the resources he provided to send over until I asked for it. In the email he classified me as ""no hire"" and shared 2 papers for autonomous driving, which I am not interested in reading. 

The interview is definitely not worth the $200 they are asking. There is clearly no structure defined and quality control from Jake. The interviewer's kid kept yelling in the background for the whole hour.

I have a combinatorial assignment problem in which a number of products, call them group A, have to be matched to another group of products, group B. Each of the products in the groups have a certain quantity and a certain price. The quantities are divisible for all products in both groups and the goal is to maximize profit. Products from each group are only able to be matched with certain others from the other group. For example, a product from group A, with quantity 100 and price 8, matches with a product from group B, with quantity 60 and price 10. The algorithm may decide to allocate the whole 60 out of 100 of the product from group A to group B resulting in a profit of the price difference times the quantity, (10-8)*60=120. Otherwise it could take the quantities from a selection of group A products that match. 

I am currently dividing all the quantities by a small amount and calculating the profits for all possible combinations of matches (putting 0 for combinations that dont match) and using a linear sum assignment algorithm to solve for the optimal assignments. This works however the matrix become too memory intensive for large quantities and number of products. In addition there are many left over quantities due to the choice of the division number. 

If anyone has any suggestions on algorithms to use or pointers to implementations thatd be very much appreciated.
