I'm torn between three options right now:

The New Razer Blade (2016)
Dell XPS 15 9550 (i7, 16 gb ram, 512 ssd)
ThinkPad T460p

So my use case is fairly straightforward as most of it will be for school.  I do play some games, but that's not really a top priority.  I really would like a dedicated gpu and quad core would be nice just in case.  I'm looking for longevity in terms of build quality and components.  

The only reason I would consider the Razer is because it just looks so nice and build quality seems top notch.  I don't have any real need for a 970m, but I've seen some sales on the Microsoft store for a few hundred dollars off that make it tempting.

I'm leaning towards the XPS 15, but have heard the keyboard sucks.  Right now, I'm using a Surface Pro 2 with type cover as my everyday laptop and have an old HP Pavilion dv6 with Ubuntu 16.04 that I use as well, so I'm thinking the keyboard would probably at least be an improvement for me.  I'm also torn between screen resolutions on this one.

The ThinkPad is attractive because I've heard that they are built to last.  Though the T460P seems to have some cheap plastic materials and seems a bit thick.

I'll probably want to dual boot Ubuntu also.

I'm not asking anyone here to do this project for me I'm just looking for help/advice for what I'm making exactly. In the first week of trying to get started, I've jumped around from thinking this was a webpage, CMS, something in Google Scripts, a Google Cloud Platform project... And I'm now I'm just confused and was hoping one of you guys could point me in the right direction.

Im working with a small startup company that deals with marketing and data analysis. I'm fairly well versed in multiple computer languages and I learn fast so I think this project is within my capabilities but I just dont know where to start.

So here's the project:

The company has a bunch of live data that they store in Google sheets. They currently use the Google add-on [Supermetrics](http://supermetrics.com/) to make graphs and visuals from the data in the sheets to assemble some sort of data visualization report for the client. Each client has one Google spreadsheet with data that can be used for his or her report.

They want me to make something like a log-in on their current website for admins and clients (It's okay if there is just one admin). When admins log-in they will get to some interface where they can see all of the clients and be able to manage their reports. 

For managing the reports they asked me to consider some sort of ""edit"" button next to the client's report. They want that link to take them to some sort of dashboard where they can customize the clients report. This part doesn't have to be too complicated. They just want to be able to add simple visualizations like tables, line graphs, bar charts, and maybe a text box similar to the way they use Supermetrics (they also expressed interest in the possibility of using [d3](https://d3js.org/) to construct their visualizations). Then there is some sort of way of uploading the edited report for the client to access.

When Clients log in they will just been taken directly to the report associated with their log-in.

That's essentially the entire project. I thought I had some sense of how this could work given my background knowledge but as of right now I'm at a loss of how to get started on this. Im hoping one of you guys can help point me in the right direction. Thanks!",2,2,False,self,,,,,

I just really want to know if it's worth it to spend a semester on C++.

About 3 years ago I took AP Comp Sci in high school, which taught Java, and I learned it pretty well I think. I got a 5 on the AP test and for a final project coded a version of the dice game ""Farkle."" At the time, however, I didn't like coding that much. My stupid high school self was too worried about being a nerd, I think, or I just didn't want to bother to keep going. So, I spend the next 2.5 years not doing any code.

I am now a math major at school, and since I am way ahead in math I have time to add a second degree, and I believe I want to do computer science. Because I have credit for Java, I was able to bypass the intro to programming class (a choice between C++ and Java) and go directly into the Intro to Algs and Data Structures class, which is also prinarily in Java. Because I signed up for this class, I have spent time reviewing basic programming principles again to refresh my memory, looking mostly at Python.

Because I also have an interest in statistics, though, I was looking at taking this statistical computing class (on top of algs and data structures) that studies simulations and programming in R, but I wasn't allowed to register since C++ is a prereq. I asked the stats department if Java would work as a valid prereq for the class, and they said ""no. Only C++ is allowed as a prereq.""

So that led me now to register in C++ in the fall along with Intro to Algs and Data Structures (in Java) which is sort of funny since C++ is one of the possible prereqs for the algorithms class (for which I am using Java as a prereq instead). So I kind of feel stupid taking C++ also if I could just review coding over the summer to prepare for Algorithms. I have heard from people that it's not about knowing many languages, but knowing 1 or 2 very well. In my mind, the pros and cons of taking C++ are:
Pros: learn another language, serves as a forced refresher, gain needed prereq to take cool statistical computing class
Cons: doesnt add much value to my education, could take a more enriching class, will take up time doing projects, perhaps slightly repetitive (I already understand classes and functions and objects and arrays and loops and all that...)

Just wondering what y'all think would be a good approach towards the base logic of this. 

I'm thinking of doing this: have a main function that takes a random integer as input between 1 and 8. Each number would represent a specific time complexity. 

 - 1 : O(1)
 - 2 : O(log(n))
 - 3 : O(n)
 - 4 : O(n(log(n)))
 - 5 : O(n^2)
 - 6 : O(n^3)
 - 7 : O(2^n)
 - 8 : O(n!)

Based on the random number chosen, it would produce an algorithm with that time complexity, then quiz the user on the algorithm and see if their input matches the complexity. Unsure of how to actually approach the creation of the functions however. 

EDIT:

I have been informed that it is indeed impossible to calculate, on the fly, the time complexity of an algorithm. Ergo this idea is defunct unless I just preload hundreds of different algorithms that have predefined time complexities defined.  ",9,13,False,self,,,,,

Choice of undergraduate major advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/4spuog/college_student_desiring_to_own_a_aerospace/,cdrootrmdashrfstar,1468448539,"Hello!

**Background:**

I am a second year Computer Science major, having previously switched from Physics/Astrophysics, who has main goal of contributing to human spaceflight in any way that I can. I entered as a Physics major because of my love for space, but I realized my natural talents lent themselves more to programming and software development. 

However, the Computer Science degree program at my university does not challenge me and I feel will not prepare to me pursue my goal of being any sort of significant contributor to the required software for future human spaceflight (mostly due to lack of technical knowledge involving physics/electronics/general engineering principles/etc. from the Computer Science degree program). 

**Question:**

If my plan is to specifically contribute software either as a member of a team under some aerospace company, or as a business working alongside another major aerospace company providing software (simulation or the like), would I see more benefit in pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering (College of Engineering) or Computer Science (College of Arts and Sciences). Here are two URLs to the degree programs for both:

[Computer Engineering](http://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/engineering_ee.html) &amp;&amp; [Computer Engineering v2](https://www.eng.fsu.edu/ece/undergrad/cpe_curriculum.html) (I am unsure of which is the most updated version).

[Computer Science](http://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/computer_science_bs.html)

I realize that my undergraduate degree is not the most critical step in achieving my goal, but I want to have the best start possible (and beginning in the fall semester will be my last opportunity to switch degree programs while still having the opportunity to college the program in four years, regardless of which path I take).

Okay, thank you for taking the time to read my post! I would appreciate and and all responses.

**Edit:** Advice could either be about the future goal, or general advice around working in software development at aerospace companies today.",10,13,False,self,,,,,

I'm a rising senior in mathematical economics and I'm planning to go on to a master's/bridge program in computer science before continuing on to a PhD in artificial intelligence. I'm a career switcher and my current internship has little to do with CS, just a little bit of statistics and Excel and game theory. However, my internship has an opportunity for me to help them with website development if I learn Ruby on Rails. I am new to programming, and I already know some of the basic syntax of Ruby and can write basic number crunching programs, but that's it. And we don't have an in-house developer, so I'd basically be looking at the existing code and maybe adding some things to it on my own.

Basically I have two choices: I can study Ruby intensely for the next four weeks, program a few things, and be able to tell graduate schools in my applications that I have been interested in computer science for a long time and did programming at my internship. After this summer, I'm guessing I'll have little use for Ruby on Rails and start learning Python and R because that is what is used in machine learning.

The other choice is that I just start learning Python or R immediately, get as much experience with them as possible in the next year or so, so that I lose the opportunity to put real world coding experience on my resume, but have more complete understanding of the most important programming languages and hopefully have more independent projects under my belt.

Which is better for maximizing my chances of being accepted into good graduate programs? Anything else to consider?

I have two choices i can choose for a certain part of my degree

They are

1. ECE 2214 (Digital Logic Design) - An introductory course to practical aspects of digital system design. The course covers digital logic design, including basic design concepts and implementation technology, number representation, synthesis of combinational and sequential logic, and the use of HDL and computer-based tools.

AND

ECE 2215 (Digital Logic Design Laboratory) - This is an introductory course to practical aspects of digital system design. Course includes the design of digital circuits with CAD tools and VHDL hardware description language


OR 

 CS 2803 (Logic design) - Switching algebra and its application in analysis and synthesis of combinational and clocked sequential circuits; minimization and realization methods. Universal logic gates, error detection and correction, register and counter operations, and memory systems.

I am an aspiring undergraduate who would like to declare a major in computer science. Currently, I am seeking an AA degree to transfer to another school for a bachelor's. The transferring school has given me this
&gt;  Completion of COP 2510 with a minimum grade of B (grade of B- is insufficient) or another introductory programming course covering a modern programming language, with an emphasis on programming concepts and design methodology with a minimum grade of B (grade of B- is insufficient).

 course requirement (and the advisers have not been able to offer more specific advice), so I am seeking some help with choosing between specific courses. The school I am attending has these options for 'introductory' programming languages, and I'm not sure which would be best in the modern day. I understand that later on, I'll likely learn several, but for a beginner whose main experience has been things like 100% completion on a codecademy course, I'd like to make sure I get as good a start as I can. 

The required pre-requisite is COP 1000: Introduction to Programming, and then my options are: COP 2250 + 2251, Java Programming I and II, COP 2360: Introduction to C# Programming + 2362: Advanced Programming with C#, and 2837+2838: 	
Visual Basic.NET Programming I &amp; II. I'm working to verify that all of these fulfill the requirement with my intended transfer, but as of now, I am under the impression that they are. Where should I start and why? 

Furthermore, am I right to be a little worried about MAT: 2311+2312? I'm only just hitting the college algebra/pre-calc levels, haven't done calculus before, but applied calculus with analytic geometry is a bit of an intimidating class title.

Let me preface this by saying my family's pretty well off. I don't know exactly how much my family makes a year, but it's something over 200,000. Me and my three siblings go to a private school that costs about 10,000 a year. That being said, my family does not have enough saved up for me to go to my dream school. They have about 100,000 saved up for each kid, and my grandparents chip in about 10,000 for each year of school. Overall, that's about 140,000. My dream school is Stanford because of their relative proximity to Silicon Valley and their machine learning opportunities. Room and board cost a little over 50,000. So, if I decide to go, I'll probably have student loan debts when I get out.

I want to major in Computer Science. I think I have a chance of getting into Stanford, but it's small because, ofc, it's Stanford. This is all based on the assumption that I do get in. My question is, is going to Stanford for a Computer Science degree worth the student loans? I could go to a state school. I live in Indiana, and IU and Perdue are both decent schools from what I've heard, and they're about 15,000 a year. My parents have told me that whatever money I have left once I graduate from college, I can either keep or use on graduate school.

So, based on my budget, what is my best undergraduate option?

In r/personalfinance, I got mixed replies. Some people said CS degrees were worthless, some said I should go to Stanford (if I get in) no matter what the cost. I think you guys know a little more about Computer Science degrees, so I'm asking you.",26,13,False,self,,,,,

Before I start school (this upcoming January), is there anything I should do to prepare for the program? Should I learn a language this summer/fall? if so, which and what's the best way to do so? If not, is there anything else anyone can recommend I do in the mean time?

My questions:
* First of all I'm missing all the core CS undergrad stuff (Algorithms/Data Structures) and I would like to get those under my belt before I apply to any program. Is there a good online school that's relatively inexpensive where I can get those on a transcript without being a degree seeking student?

* Third, is there a better program out there? It has to be online and it has to have some sort of relevance to data analysis.

I do not have very good programming skills. Never done much programming outside of assignment work. I have spoken to my professors and they said do what you enjoy doing or areas which you have interest in. I have enjoyed working with artificial intelligence and learning about it, but dont have much experience on creating one. Will be doing another course on it for year 3. 

I have good understanding of Java and MySQL and Web (HTML, CSS etc.) and have experience using C#, Visual Basic and PHP. The reason why I do not have very good programming skills is because I have missed the first year of computer science due to doing business computing and for second year we all entered computer science due business computing did not have much interest. 

For a dissertation project I was thinking of creating a simply game such as chess, checkers, noughts and crosses etc. Vs. a computer. The main focus area will be creating the AI for the game. The main concern is will this project be accepted? I do not know how difficult this project will even be. If this project is too simple it will be rejected. My professor who decides if this project will be allowed is on holiday atm. 

One of my old college lectures recommends me doing a research, survey base dissertation. I honestly do not know how to even start one. One classmate is also doing a research base dissertation about effectiveness of teamwork. 

Starting to develop anxiety and depression because of this dissertation. Even if I get a pass I will get still a 2.1 or even first class. Got 90-98% on most modules. 

If anyone has an easy dissertation project idea or theory, research base one. Please share with me.
