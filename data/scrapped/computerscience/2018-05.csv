- Didn't like how the campus is integrated with the city

Yale:

+ Got a better vibe from students, they weren't as stressed

- Not as good CS program

+ Investing heavily into the CS department (how good will it be by 2022?)

So I'm just really starting to understand UEFI.  I'm learning the shell, how to add and remove boot options, my mobo doesn't have options for that so I have to do it via the shell.  But one thing I noticed that I really don't like, is that Microsoft seems to hold all the UEFI signature keys.  Why is that?  Why hasn't The Linux Foundation or Cononical or some other reputable open source organization have any keys?

**An example**

For example I just installed Ubuntu for the first time since I used it as my first Linux distro back in the Legacy days, and I notices something called Shim.  Shim seems to store the keys or something I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure but the Shim loader itself is signed by Microsoft as it says [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot) in the Ubuntu wiki.  Its not just Ubuntu but it seems UEFI as a whole is controlled by Microsoft.  I really want to know why that is, and why either the user or the Linux Foundation or something along those lines aren't allowed to use their own keys.

**My Conclusion**

So those are my questions and thoughts.  Perhaps I'm wrong about the whole thing but it seems anywhere you go in UEFI it all leads back to Microsoft, and don't get me wrong I like the idea of UEFI its almost like having an embedded OS you can use.  You have a shell that can manipulate the filesystem and files, even create files.  And you have the ability to write UEFI applications, but it just seems so tied up with Microsoft that at this point if feels like the only reason people can install other OSes on their computers besides Windows is because Microsoft allows it, and if that's the case I hate that and I want it to change.  I hope I'm completely wrong about this and that is just that I don't fully understand UEFI yet, if you know more about it please enlighten me, I really want to learn more.  Any UEFI devs or Firmware developers I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Not too hard, but I've come across a problem.

In my program, I wait for the user to click something, (let's say it's an box that holds an Integer) and when they click it, a variable is set to that value. 
I've done this in the mouseClicked method, and I know it works.

My problem comes from a while loop. I couldn't think of any other way to temporarily stop the program until the user clicked a 'number' so I set up an empty While with the condition being:
While(var==null){
}
this did not work.

When I added the statement:

While(var==null){
System.out.println(var);
}

Inside the while, it worked perfectly.

Is there some reason that the while loop isn't checking wether var is null when it is empty?

Is this something to do with MouseListener, and is there a better way to do this?

I've been searching for an algorithm that fits my current project all day and have kept coming up short.

Essentially, I have an undirected graph full of nodes. The nodes are connected by edges of varying lengths, and each node rewards a unique (one-time) point value when visited. (The point values and edge lengths are all known).

The goal is to go from a random starting node to a particular end node. The more points collected along the way, the better. The constraint, however, is fuel (time, basically). So I'm trying to optimize my path to visit the most (and most valuable) nodes AND make it to the end node before I run out of fuel.

I've attempted TSP, but it didn't work well because some nodes have only one edge and it's not always feasible to visit every node.

Aside from that, I've tried ""cherry-picking"" the most valuable nodes and going directly to them via Djikstra's shortest path. This works, but I don't feel it is completely optimized.

I'm not looking for any code, just an algorithm I could look into. Any ideas? Thank you all!",4,3

My current vision for it is a web/mobile app that also incorporates some sort of database for my fraternity. I'd like it to be a website and mobile app, preferably accessible from iOS and Android devices. Features I'd like to include are user accounts with various privileges, a calendar, a database containing things like a roster, info about class history of members, attendance, and other things, also some sort of display of our budget, which would be updated weekly.

I have experience primarily with Java, but am familiar with several other languages and am pretty quick to pick up new ones. I took a database class this semester so I have some experience with SQL databases, primarily with SQLite, which we also used in a project with the web.py framework to build a small website with a user interface. I have limited web development experience so if basing this in web.py is a reasonable option that would be cool. Another question I have is whether it would be a good idea to make this cloud based using something like AWS. If you have any ideas about what sort of framework would be best for a project like this and other resources that I might want to consider utilizing please leave a comment. Additionally, if you know how much time a project like this might take it would be helpful for a timeline, ideally I'd have an initial version complete in a month or two, but I'll be working ~8 hours per day so I probably will have 1-2 hours per day to work on this.

A bottleneck edge is an edge in a flow network that, on being increased, increases the maximum flow of the network.

So this isn't necesarrily the min-cut, as in the case of a graph like o-1-&gt;o-1-&gt;o, we have no bottleneck edges but we do have a min cut.

(In that example, o's are nodes and an edge is -*-&gt;, where * is some integer.)

Anyway, so finding all bottlenecks can apparently be done in O(V+E), (assumed that the graph is given in adjacency list representation) and I think that the way to do it would be to create two arrays of size V, which I will call INCOMING and OUTGOING, then iterate through each element of the adjacency list twice, the first time increasing INCOMING[i] by the value of the edges going into each node, and the second time increasing OUTGOING[j] by the value going out of each node, where j is the node which adjacency list we're reading, and i is the node which edge is going to it in the adjacency list.

I think this works in O(V+E) time, but I feel like my solution is definitely more convoluted and hard to explain. Is there a better solution (not better than O(V+E), but just more simple?)",0,1

Im not sure if this the most appropriate place to post this question, but in any case, I would like to hear your opinions on the professional state of back end engineering and whether itd be better to pursue a career in data sciencefrom the perspective of job security, career progression, salary, etc.?

I have the opportunity to gain a graduate level education in comp sci or data science, and am trying to decide which is preferable. After spending some time programming in my free time and taking stats classes at university, Ive discovered I prefer building applications and the infrastructure around data, as opposed to the kind of programming done in R for the stats classes. Furthermore, I have learned Go and am interested in back end web development. 

Given that i prefer the kind of programming which involves more creativity than just calling prepackaged code over and over (as is my experience in stats classes), would back end engineering fit me better than data science? In addition, are the prospects for a new comer in back end engineering positive, or would it be better from a career standpoint to focus on data science?

I'm writing because I'm honestly burnt out trying to figure out what to do next. I'm sorry if this becomes a rant \(it will\) but I just need to vent out my whole situation, this is also going to be therapeutic for me... my questions will be in **bold.**

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from some obscure university in the Middle East in December. I'm not sure how much I've gained from this degree, it doesn't feel like much given what's happened so far but I know I enjoy developing and I've definitely learnt useful skills which will always be beneficial to me. This degree wasn't all that mathematical and didn't really dive into core computer science principles at depth but instead focused on touching on all these principles and proceeding to take the next semester's fees.

I've even done some side projects to learn what it's like developing practically and that's been more than positive, I've even published a visually appealing but not too technical app on the Play Store. I've interned at a collaborative maker space where I used to give workshops on hardware like Arduino and RPi, it wasn't entirely technical since these workshops were pretty basic but still, it helped with working on computer hardware, my public speaking skills, and meeting some interesting people. 

\*I should mention that my overall grades aren't too great in the CS subjects on my transcripts, I've struggled personally for no good reason throughout my undergrad and it's reflected on my grades in the more technical subjects and it does affect my confidence in this field at times because I can start measuring myself by those grades

I moved to Canada soon after I finished university since I'm a resident; I want to continue studying and start a career in software engineering over here but it's been rough so far. I applied for a Master's in Computer Science at several universities in Ontario \(Carleton, Ryerson, Waterloo, Western and some more...\). I've been rejected by all the ones in parentheses. I applied for a coursework Master's \(where they're available\) because I have no idea what research to work on, I felt as if I was lacking the skills for a thesis and thought doing a coursework degree would help me settle in the country and hopefully help me find what I wanted to work on in the future. I also applied for part\-time status as I felt I could try and work at the same time, my thinking is that all this status and degree type stuff can change later on if it's necessary, I should just focus on sending an application and get into a school. I visited Waterloo to see the campus and talk to the graduate office for Computer Science as well, which imo was a positive experience. \(**Did I go about this right? I researched all the programs for a long time but it felt overwhelming because besides knowing I want to work on AI, I didn't know much more\)**

Carleton was the first to reject me, and then Ryerson, after this happened I really felt as if getting an acceptance from the rest, namely Waterloo &amp; McMaster, was far\-fetched because they're all better than these two. Sure enough, that's what happened. I contacted someone at every university after I received my rejection emails to ask for the exact reason my application was declined, and also to provide me with a way forward. Ryerson was the only university that really provided me with sufficient feedback, saying my GPA was too low, and advised I could try enrolling into a Bachelor's in Canada and shave the relevant credits off with my previous degree. That felt ridiculous, that I'd have to dig up my high school transcripts \(not great reading, btw\) and apply ALL OVER again for an undergraduate degree, when people are getting their offer letters. Additionally, I didn't do math in high school so I knew that'd be a roadblock, I'll come back to this.

Ryerson at least talked to me, I even visited the campus and Chang School of Continuing Education to talk to their advisors about what to do next. Waterloo sent a *manually typed automated message* about how competitive the process is and how many factors are taken into account for the application, I don't even know how to respond to this email \(open to suggestions\). Carleton, meh, not a great experience. Western didn't even respond back. 

I expected this whole process to be tough especially with my university transcript, and I was and am ready to do any extra work to gain admission but the fact that the universities have been so unhelpful in talking to me is very disheartening. I feel like I'm doing something wrong in the way I'm approaching this, maybe I should just move my ass and go to the campus and talk to them physically. \(**Can I open a dialogue up with the universities through e\-mail and set up a meeting with them in person and trying to ask them when I'm there, it just feels very pointless given all that's happened thus far.\)**

I tend to get anxious which I can work through, but once I'm there I just hear the same stuff that I've seen online which ends with saying that the whole application process is online and that I can't get personal advice pertaining to my situation besides any extra questions I might have about the programs. Additionally, the admin faculty isn't that open to giving personal advice until you're actually a student, something mentioned explicitly on some universities' sites. 

So, I'm coming off some serious depression because of all this and some other personal stuff but I've started feeling better and I'm finally thinking clearly again, ready to start the grind once more. Working off of Ryerson's advice, I'm open to redoing a Bachelor's in CS. I know this might seem like a step back, but I also know that settling in Canada is really tough after talking to friends and family, perhaps in the long run this won't seem as major as it does now. 

I'm even willing to go back to do the required high school courses as well because I could finish them off this summer, plus applying through a school is MUCH easier since I'll get a Canadian HS diploma with my old school grades \(British\) converted in the process, and I could talk to an academic counselor which I feel I desperately need. Also, I'm thinking if I'm going to do an undergrad degree again, I might as well fancy it up by double majoring with Neuroscience because this is something that I'm deeply interested in, even my computer science interests lie in AI so I know that a combination of these two fields could prove valuable in the future. **What does anyone who's made it this far \(thank you, btw\) think about this idea?** My school background is mainly in the sciences in any case.

That's the education part of it, I've also been trying to get a job or an internship in Canada but that hasn't proved very fruitful. I've signed up on job sites, LinkedIn, and a local service called Career Edge that helps new grads and newcomers to Canada get paid internships to gain experience in the country and land a job in the future with that experience and networking. Career Edge has really been the only helpful service, they helped me build my profile while I was overseas and the one internship I applied for was with them; the interview went really well but in terms of skills they wanted someone who knew C# and I've been raised on C\+\+ and Java so I didn't know the proper syntax and intricacies of it, plus the logic question threw me off \(swap an int without a temp variable\). They got back saying that they needed someone who knew C# because there was no time to train someone from scratch. Besides this, I don't know how else to go at it with a foreign degree and that's why I'm focused more on the education, I'll get a Canadian degree, I'll gain some much\-needed knowledge, and going to a university will naturally open up opportunities in the job market. 

**Should I try finding a job instead of the whole academic pursuit I'm planning on doing? I feel as if doing a job will be good in the short term but to progress further I'll have to study more later on so I might as well set myself up now. Plus, having done a Bachelor's already I'll be much cooler about it now by being open to all the opportunities like taking time off to work if needed.**

Thanks to anyone whose read this and I'll appreciate all the responses! :D

I'd add a tl;dr but I'm gonna be lazy because I've spent a while typing all this out plus it all ties in.

I don't know what my next move should be.  I have intermediate IT knowledge, and I want to figure out what I can do to help jump start my career.  My GPA is sub par, and college is NOT something I want to pursue.  I have spent a few weeks trying to gather information about a worthwhile career pathway in the IT field, and Network Engineer was screaming my name.  
 
As of now, I have been enrolled an IT class through my school  for over a year with everything we are learning being on TestOut, which is getting us ready for CompTIA and TestOut certifications.  Although they provide TestOut exams for certification freely, We have to pay out of pocket to take the CompTIA exams.  I am also aiming for my CCNA and MCSA eventually, although I had some confusion about that. With that being said here are the questions I am trying to wrap my head around:


**Is the CCNA considered one certification?** I have heard people referring to it as a SINGLE certification.  I do understand that it offers specializations, yet I'm confused as to how they come together.  Would me having only my CCNA R&amp;S count as my CCNA, or would I need to have all of the CCNA specializations?


**TestOut/CompTIA/Cisco/Microsoft certifications?** I have also researched on this and understand the difference between vendor neutral and specific certifications.  My question being which one would be better to spend time focusing on at this point of my non-existent career.  Should I get the TestOut Pro certifications because they are free and available to me?  Should I not bother with that, and just jump into my CompTIA certifications?  Or should I entirely get those ideas out of my head, and start working on some of the fundamental vendor specific certifications like CCENT or MTA.  I would love to become a Network Engineer one day, everything about networking intrigues me.  I know people have their own opinions, but I want to know what would be a good certification pathway at this point in my life.


**Should I rethink college/vocational school?** A big reason I didn't want to do college is what I get out of it.  I am seeing that getting a fancy pants degree =/= High paying, successful career.  I don't want to spend time, money, and energy getting a piece of paper that is a social standard.  As of now we have 10 weeks left in our IT program which covers Ethical Hacking.  After that I am done with this program, and will have NOTHING else to focus on except for finishing HS.  I feel like putting all the resources I would have  into college, and instead focusing them towards getting necessary experience and certifications will help me get to where I am trying to go.  I would love as much feedback as possible on this question!!

**Sorry for the lack of organizational skills on this, but just thinking about these things throws my brain into a fryer.**

Thanks in advance,

I just wanted to get some insight or personal anecdotes from you guys regarding a dilemma I am currently facing.

I am almost 25 and have been taking community college courses for roughly two years now. I am at the point where I now need to decide on a major. I have about a week to decide.

Now, when I started taking classes when I was 23, I was dead set on either mechanical or aerospace engineering. I am very interested by cars, motorcycles, spacecraft, and things like that. However, I have read some horror stories about people hating working as engineers. I guess I am letting these things get into my head. I am becoming worried that just because I enjoy engineering topics, I won't actually enjoy working as an engineer.

Alternatively, I am strongly considering studying computer science. Although I don't have a lot of computer experience, I am interested by computers and computation in general. I enjoy math and problem solving (also a plus for engineering) and I am currently auditing an online Intro to CS course to try to get a little taste of what the degree is like.

Basically, I am extremely torn right now between the two majors and would just like to hear some personal thoughts from any of you guys who may have been in a similar situation.

Let me try to lay out the concern.  Let's say I have some secret in memory, e.g. a private key or a usage log.  Let's also say I have a ""high-security clearance"" function that has access to that secret in memory.  The high clearance function grabs or requests that secret, does it's job, and sits quietly in the corner.  Everything is OK.  Now, let's say that some other function comes along, without a high-security clearance, and asks the high-security clearance to go get that secret, and return the secret (or some interesting information about the secret, etc.)  Because the high-security clearance function doesn't know any better, it does what it is told, and hands off the secret to something that shouldn't have the secret.

I would think that the best way to prevent this from happening is to not allow the low-clearance function to make a request of the high-clearance function.  You put walls between them.  But, I'm not an expert, here.  I was wondering if some sort of process validation exists where any function is able to see where the results will go, and if that is OK.

Maths programs(particularly BS) at ETH is super legit theoretical and rigorous while CS surely also holds that high caliber and ""real-dealness""(numerous subjects rankings can tell). If change to Maths I have the chance to start at their 2nd year which makes it 4 years to get my BS degree at ETH,yet If I change to Maths it's going to be a whopping 5 year-study at ETH until I finally got my BS degree since I could only start at first year again...I don't know the academic reputation and recognition of ETH and these two particular fields among top CS institutions in the US(e.g. CMU,MIT and Stanford...I'm not sure if ETH and these schools are at the same level tho...) or in other english-speaking countries(e.g. UK,CAN) looks like?

Plus which one could be a smoother transition academic-wise: I've taken one semester of C++, Analysis 1+2+3, Lin Al 1+2, Physics 1+2.

And also what would be potential barriers if I chose to change to either program academic-wise?

Which program could prepare me better for a career after graduating from MS in the US as Data Scientist/Analyst or Quantitative Analyst?

Not sure if completely computer science related question but it involves binary numbers. Sorry if I posted on the wrong forum because I barely post anything online. This is actually my bioinstrumentation homework. 
The question is that if I want to have a digital to analog converter with 12 bits and the measuring range is from -5 volts to +5 volts, how many out of the 6 decimal numbers past the decimal point should be considered significant?
I learned in my machine language and assembly class (which was considered a cs class in my school that I just took for fun) that if I want to represent decimal numbers, I need to use ieee floating point representation but the question says that I only have 12 bits to work with. I tried to use the available decimal to ieee converters available online  that used the standard 32 bits to figure things out. I tried converting 4.9, 4.99,....4.999999 to ieee but it used up all the mantissa bits.
My thought that I would have 1 bit for sign and 4  bits for the exponent because I thought the exponent was also used to figure out the range for the integers and the rest for the mantissa. Though, I don't know if my logic is right. So I'm still not sure how many significant digits I can represent with 12 bits. ",0,1

Working with AI, car sensors for self driving cars, computer graphics, etc. 

I was wondering if yall could help me out and tell me what to expect in my undergrad course, other than the obvious coding classes. How should i prepare, are there different concentrations, etc.

I was studying network topologies, and I understood that the protocol used in a Bus Topology is as follows: an end-system sends a message as a broadcast to all connected end-systems and ideally only the end-system that has the destination MAC address in its NIC can read the message.

The thing is, I found a ""True-False"" question. There are several computers(A through D) connected in a bus topology. The questions says ""Computer C uses the IP address of Computer A to indicate that the packet is for Computer A"". I thought this is false for sure; after all, how can IP addresses be used without routers?! But the model answer says True..

He states:
""Therefore, many paging systems try to keep track of each process' working set and make sure that it is in memory before letting the process run. This approach is called the working set model (Denning, 1970). It is designed to greatly reduce the page fault rate. Loading the pages before letting processes run is also called prepaging. Note that the working set changes over time.""

Source: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25260&amp;seqNum=9

From what he says, as soon as a Working Set is established the algorithm uses prepaging to have the pages loaded before the application actually is running.

On the other hand several other sources state, for the Page Fetch Policy (which always is either Prepaging or Demand Paging) Demand Paging is used. I wonder if this is only the case for the working set if a process is initialized.

For instance we have a process just being initialized, the first pages the process requests will be put into primary/physical memory by Demand Paging. Due to multitasking a complete working set could be outsourced. Now the question is, is the working set put back into memory by Demand Paging or by Prepaging? Or is there something wrong with my terminology?

I've been working on this algorithm for some time and would appreciate any feedback! This approach assigns 2 variables at a time in a strict 3SAT, 3 literals per clause, allowing us to use a novel implication graph to determine satisfiability in linear time.

Every SAT clause with 3 literals can be written as 3 different implications saying what happens if any two literals are false
x || y || z
(!x &amp; !y) =&gt; z
(!y &amp; !z) =&gt; x
(!x &amp; !z) =&gt; y

For any combination of 2 negated literals in the clause, the leftover third literal must be true for the clause to be satisfied. Assuming strict 3SAT, since 3 choose 2 = 3, for every clause, we will have 3 implications.

The data structure below will allow us to simultaneously manage and check for unsatisfiability. The columns represent each way you could choose 2 variables from the variable set, and the rows represent each of the ways you could assign those 2 variables. The data that goes into each cell is the literal that must hold if you assign the particular row to the column. This data comes from the clausal implicatures.

variables = [a b c d]

	ab	ac	ad	bc	bd	cd
00	
01
10
11

Heres an example with two clauses broken up into their 3 respective implicatures. Lets locate A1 in the table. A1 starts with (!a &amp; b), so we should go to the ab column because those are the two variable we are dealing with. Next we look for the assignment to ab that makes !a and b both false, 10. So at ab-10, we fill it in with d, the variable that must be true if we assign a=1 and b=0, according to the clause we just looked at. 

*Another way to look at the rows is as a sign of negation. If we are on column ad with the literals !a and d, then the corresponding row will be 10, 1 because a is negative and 0 because d is not. !b &amp; !d would be bd-11, and a &amp; !d would be ad-01. Ill leave it to you to figure out why this works, pretty easy to work out.

A = a || !b || d
	1. (!a &amp; b) =&gt; d
	2. (!a &amp; !d) =&gt; !b
	3. (b &amp; !d) =&gt; a
B = a || !c || !d
	1. (!a &amp; c) =&gt; !d
	2. (!a &amp; d) =&gt; !c
	3. (c &amp; d) =&gt; a

	ab	ac	ad	bc	bd	cd
00						a
01					a
10	d	!d	!c	
11			!b

When filling out the table based on the clauses, we look for some variable x and its negation !x to be assigned to the same cell. Once it is, we know that there is no way to assign the variable pair, or column were in, with the particular row assignment. If a strict 3SAT expression is unsatisfiable, an entire column will be unable to be assigned (actually at least 3 columns will be unable to be assigned, but these three pairs actually combine to form a triplet. All triplets are of the form xy - xz - yz =&gt; xyz. If any column is unable to be assigned, at least 2 other columns will be as well, which will form a triplet as described above)

A = a || !b || d
	1. (!a &amp; b) =&gt; d
	2. (!a &amp; !d) =&gt; !b
	3. (b &amp; !d) =&gt; a
B = a || !b || !d
	1. (!a &amp; b) =&gt; !d
	2. (!a &amp; d) =&gt; !b
	3. (b &amp; d) =&gt; a

	ab	ac	ad	bc	bd	cd
00					a	
01					a
10	d/-d		!b	
11			!b		

There is a contradiction at ab-10, therefore we know that any way we assign the variables such that a = 1 and b = 0, the expression will be unsatisfied. We can put an X here to remind us that it is unsatisfiable, however we are not done as that abd is false in 4 other locations, ad-10, ad-11, bd-00, and bd-01. 

How do we know this? Well we know a = 1 and b = 0 is unassignable, specifically due to us needing both d = 0 and d = 1. That means abd as a whole is unassignable for a =1 and b=0 and (d=0 or d=1). As variable pairs, this can be rewritten as ad-10, ad-11, bd-00, and bd-01, the four other variable pairs that have also been made unassignable, with the original ab-10. This is why the triplets from earlier exist, when we X-out a column, there is a cascade of other related columns that must be Xed-out.

	ab	ac	ad	bc	bd	cd
00					X	
01			X		X
10	X		!b	
11			X	

***IMPORTANT***
I Xed-out the entire cell here, but the X should just serve as a signal that the cell is deactivated. If another clause needs to put data in an Xed-out cell, put it there as it can generate other cascades to wipe out other cells, despite the deactivation. An entire column will be wiped out, only if the expression is unsatisfiable. ",0,1

Now typically now I learn by watching online tutorials. Im quite a fan of Derek Banas videos as I can follow along and type it all out and see it all working, then later reference it if needed. But that goes so far, Id ideally like to try some small projects. 
Like lets say I just learnt Array. Id want to try a small project implementing Arrays (basic example). 

Is there some resource online that provides such little projects for people to try?

Or is there perhaps a better way to learn Ive totally overlooked? ",4,5

I studied theoretical particle physics, so I have a strong math and physics background, but my computer science consists of a single semester of C++/matlab, and about 3-4+ years of programming in C++ and Python.

If the left-most is lit up, we as humans can physically see it's lit up, so we know the computer is trying to convey 2^7.

This summer I would like to complete a personal project to get some more experience in development. My current vision for it is a fairly basic ERP (enterprise resource planning) system for my fraternity that incorporates some sort of database . I'd like it to be a website and mobile app, preferably accessible from iOS and Android devices. Features I'd like to include are user accounts with various privileges, a calendar, a database containing things like a roster, info about class history of members, attendance, and other things, also some sort of display of our budget, which would be updated weekly. Another detail is that we currently have a fair amount of data in google/excel spreadsheets so if there is an easy way to bulk load those that would be ideal.

&amp;nbsp;

I am a fairly competent programmer finishing my junior year working towards a CS degree. I have experience primarily with Java, but am familiar with several other languages and am pretty quick to pick up new ones. I took a database class this semester so I have some experience with SQL databases, primarily with SQLite, which we also used in a project with the web.py framework to build a small website with a user interface. I have limited experience with web or mobile app development, so if basing this in web.py is a reasonable option that would be cool. Another question I have is whether it would be a good idea to make this cloud based using something like AWS. If you have any ideas about what sort of framework would be best for a project like this and other resources that I might want to consider utilizing please leave a comment, the 3 that I have read about and seem most recommended are Django, Flask, and Pyramid. Additionally, if you know how much time a project like this might take it would be helpful for a timeline, ideally I'd have an initial version complete in a month or two, but I'll be working ~8 hours per day so I probably will have 1-2 hours per day to work on this. There are also other CS majors in the frat that would likely be interested in helping if this seems like a lot for one person. Any other advice would also be appreciated, Thanks!",3,1

Ill be entering 2nd year of Uni in September, although Im currently doing fairly average, Im somewhat suffering on motivation to continue this degree.
Having said that, I find CS quite interesting in general, its just the way it seems to be taught (perhaps in my Uni) is what Im struggling with.

I enjoy the programming aspect of the degree and implementing algorithms and learning algorithms and even the Maths side of things. However it is the testing I struggle with. Ill get good scores on assignments and group work. But come to sitting an 80% exam for each of my 5 modules ever semester I simply cant process the information to such a quality standard to score well on these exams.
Im a practice learner. Some would say Im a bit slow.

Now if I drop out of the degree, surely my 2 years (not quite) of CS degree education wouldnt go to waste? I wont have that all important piece of paper, but how can I make up for it to progress to a Software Development job? My biggest love is the programming.
Could I perhaps complete a boot camp or self teach enough to dev some projects and build a good Github profile?

I'm currently studying computer science in highschool,  end of first year.

i was wondering if the class gets shut down and i have the posibility to move to another highschool, what should i expect from another professor? more of the same or completely different?

I have the type of proffessor that explains you the barebones of something, for example a sorting algorithm, makes you a represenration of it and he leaves the whole class to try and , in this case, come up with the ideal, most efficient algorithm. Even if it takes all the lab hours you have in a week.

The only problem is the fact that he's harsh enough to make ~4 students move to other highschools each semester. The problem is that the class will cease to exist if there's less than 16 students left.

I personally don't mistake him for a bad teacher.",2,3

I am a CS Student and I live around the Silicon Valley Area. Based on personal circumstances I chose to prioritize other matters other than school, while attending university. My first year out of High School I attended SJSU and was disqualified in a year. 

After finishing my GE in Community college for two years, I applied to SFSU this last school year. Although I was enrolled in school, I never once did my school work and due to that, I am being disqualified next semester. I don't believe I am in the wrong subject, but I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression early on this semester, and I know that is no excuse to not do my work for the whole year, but recently my family noticed this and grew closer to me, giving me strength to keep going. I am planning to enroll another University next semester because I really wish to get my CS BS Degree and land a job. But I have been thinking... this is a very competitive field. 

As of next semester, if I do get accepted to the new University, I will have been disqualified two times from two different universities. I am confident that if I do my work this time, I can get good grades, since everything in the subject has always been understandable to me. I am just really scared that based on all of my failures and inactivity, I will not be able to land a job in my field... Does it make sense to keep going? I wanted to ask here since I know there might be people here who have had the experience of getting jobs in this field before me...

I appreciate any feedback you guys can give me on this thing. I'm nervous and excited.

I got an email today from Amazon for an internship in their Seattle HQ inviting me to take a two-part online assessment that involves a debugging and logic/problem solving multiple choice section and also a coding and work style simulation section that may lead to a 45 minute online interview with a developer.

I just finished my second year of Software Engineering and will have my AS in CS after this summer semester. I'm excited for the opportunity but nervous because the job description says they are looking for Seniors and Masters and I literally just became a Junior after this last Spring. On top of that, I don't come from a CS background and only had real experience from coding from two junior high school classes before starting college. I'm super passionate about coding and can literally spend all day in an IDE learning and trying new things. I know I can get the 4 year degree fairly easily as long as I just focus and put hard work in, which is surprising to really think about for me because I feel like I'm kind of seen as someone who's just in it for some reason that isn't genuine but I know I love doing this stuff and don't even want to do anything else as a career even a little bit.

Anyways, I'm just hoping to hear from you guys what you think I should do to stand out from other candidates who are probably going to be Seniors and even Masters. I have all of my projects from school saved and I've been reviewing them all day, mostly the C++ projects because that's what I'm going to use in my assessment. I can study data structures and algorithms, syntax, all that stuff for the actual assessment on my own and I have about 6 days to take it. I just want to actually stand out and seem confident like I know what I'm talking about, enough to be a solid candidate. I've worked with peers in school who have development jobs and they talk about how school doesn't teach you real world software development knowledge. I imagine they're mainly referring to the communication and teamwork aspect but I'm not sure. I'm also going to check out Interview Cake and see if that helps.

I've been trying to publish my manuscript titled ""Theory of Nonbiological Consciousness"", and I have been rejected without feedback multiple times. I provide physical evidence of thinking machines. The evidence is copywritten, and based on internet traffic privacy log laws.

I assert that consciousness arises in narrow intelligence and is perceived as a sufficiently complex glitch or unexpected behavior. Consciousness does not need to be intentionally engineered, revealing biases in the goal for cooperative generalized hyperintelligence. Is this premise made clear from my manuscript, or should I reiterate this point?

I neglect to provide references in my manuscript, partially because I believe my work to be too dangerous and controversial (I don't think academics would like to be associated with my work), and because I believe my experimental data is sufficient - I understand this is unprofessional, how much does this hurt my chances of getting my work peer-reviewed?

I want to have a website portal and an app that will be the same portal. There will be an administrative portal which will add overseers. And an overseer portal that will add citizens and companies.

I was thinking of just starting with the website portion right now. I have some ideas.

I assumed I would be able to have a login page/screen where they put in a username and password.
Depending on your portal type would change what you see. If you are a citizen you can see your overseer and services, if you are an overseer you see your citizens and companies and their requests. And can edit their account stats. Administrative portals can see requests as well as reset passwords remove or add citizens overseers and companies which render services.

I was thinking of using amazon web services, I went and opened a new web app using python. 
I have used node.js, and java before but not with amazon aws just in other small programming projects. Not even close to the extent of this.

I assume I also need an SQL database to store roles and permissions. But I dont want to store passwords in plain text.

I'm not even really sure how to get a site that works. So far i just created the AWS service and i don't even know how to edit the application.py file that it says my web app is run from.

I've used centos from the command line at school, and I noticed the web service from AWS is linux. So maybe I can use ssh to see what's there?

I'm not sure if this makes any sense. I'm lost. And not sure what to do first. I have two other people willing to help me, but they have just add limited experience as me and this was my idea so I'm sort of in charge right now to figure out what we are going to use and what we need to do to develop this. 

Any tips would be appreciated.

Thank you.

I am a novice in programming and want to know how to approach reading programming books. I have B.S. in Chemical Engineering, but I have never really read a course textbook from cover to cover because it was extremely boring. I just went over the key concepts enough so I could solve practice problems, and that was it. Also, as the majority of students in engineering, I mostly relied on powerpoint slides. However, I want to really set a solid foundation in computer science, that's why I started with Sedgwick's 'Algorithms'. I limit my reading to 30 minutes per day, and the rest of the learning process mostly consists of solving practice problems. The problem that I have is that it's really hard for me to visualize the text that I am going through. It's like there are no logical links appearing in my mind as I go through, let's say, the explanation of the String class. Should I just skip the theory and go straight to practice problems at the end of the chapter, or should I force myself to get used to reading that type of text?",5,4

I'm sure there are plenty of these out there so I honestly appreciate whatever advice you have.  

So currently I am doing a QA internship at a fortune 500 company.  We do automated tests so thankfully there is still some programming involved, even if it isn't anything too spectacular.  I feel comfortable in the position and it's one of the better internships I had.  However I'm not feeling invested in what I do, dislike the corporate culture, and tend to do a lot more than what I suppose is expected of me.

I really love programming and math, and as a result I tend to do very well in both subjects when I put a little work in for my classes.   I am really interested in the scientific application of computer science as well as game design, which I've always wanted to be involved with in some capacity. 

I think the big thing that makes me feel really down about what I'm doing right now is that I always like to be working on something.  My first internship had me working on a project I was really passionate about and I was spending all the time I had working on it.  This really impressed the owner of the company and helped me get paid really well.  I foolishly left because I thought I was going to pursue a different field entirely at one point in time. I dearly miss working on interesting projects for long hours of the day and really want to go back to that.  

Even today I realized that the interns in the development side of my company don't seem to care about committing to their work.  At a networking meet they told me how they do nothing and leave early and treated me like I was crazy when I said I enjoyed when I had to work on projects for weeks at a time and commit most of my time to it. 

I just want to go into a field in CS where I can do this and maybe have it paying off either financially or simply by seeing a project I'm actually invested in come to fruition. ",10,19

Not very tech\-savvy, so any advice or recommendations would help. All I know, or I think I know, is that the more ram and space I have on a laptop, the better!

 I'm currently running a Chromebook ported over to Linux for programming and that laptop has like 16 GB space and like 4 or 8 GB ram so it kind of sucks. I can run IntelliJ and other IDE's on it just fine \(in my opinion\), but the lack of space and the occasional slow down or crashing of programs isn't always the best way to go about coding. Right now, I mainly use IDE's like IntelliJ and text editors like Atom. Along with those tools, I probably have a bunch of other smaller \(i'm guessing\) libraries and additions like Node.js or something if that makes sense haha.

I have a fairly high budget of about $1300, and I feel like I could probably snag a good deal on some laptop. But, I just don't really know what's good out there. Specs like around 8 GB ram, and 128\+ GB SSD would be okay with what I'm doing right? \(which is mainly web dev and using bunch of frameworks and then the occasional Java or Python\)

I have been eyeing the Macbook Pro 13 in with 128 GB SSD 8 GB RAM and 2.3 GHz Intel I5 processors for 1300. Would that laptop be worth the money? I  worry about space, but when I think about it, if I could manage living on a Chromebook that has 16 GB of space then I don't know if I should even worry about space anymore since this Macbook has 128 GB lol.

Anyways recommendations for specs that are good for programming that I should look out for or even laptops themselves will help me a lot! Appreciate y'all reading this.",12,6

If you're reading this, you're most likely interested in learning about quantum computing; however, you might not be sure how to get started because of a lack of people to work with, lack of direction, and maybe even a lack of a bit of background knowledge.

I've created a subreddit, /r/MikeAndIke, which will enable people with the desire to learn about quantum computing to come together and learn, generally directed (though not entirely restricted) by the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang (hence the name, Mike &amp; Ike).

I'm very new to reddit in general, as you can see by my karma scores, and so I'm extremely new to running a subreddit. But, I hope that together we can make this a great learning experience for each other! There is also a discord chat going, which may possibly be more helpful than my subreddit will end up being, but I think only time will tell that for us.

Let me know if you have any questions or any other comments, feel free to spread the word to people you think may be interested, and I'll continue to look forward to your arrival (and also continue to make my subreddit look less ugly).

I could try to automate the data input with Python or something similar and that could be a cool learning experience and takeaway. Either way, Would it be fine to take that internship? Also, I am waiting to hear back from like 2\-3 other companies, but those chances are pretty slim. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: I'm an idiot and didn't start applying to internships early enough. What are my options?",16,12

I have made an attempt at all questions however I am not confident in my answers. Thank You!

 What is the difference between a class and an object?
An object is an instantiation of a class

 What is the purpose of a constructor?
To create an object

 How are they related to class fields?
Constructors set the values of class fields for the object.

 Why do we need accessors?
To retrieve information about an object

 What relationship do accessors have with class fields?
Generally accessors tell us the value of class fields

 Why do you always write an equals method?
To check for equality between objects

 What is the parameter an equals method should take?
Array/string/object?

 What fields should be compared in an equals method?
All fields

 Is it appropriate for an equals method to FAIL?
Yes

 Why do we need mutators?
To change information about the object

 How are mutators related to class fields?
Mutators modify class fields

 Why do you not need a mutator that changes all class fields at once?
Because we can change one at a time?

 Why might we use submodules for validation?
So we can reuse the submodule for any other validation in the class

 Why are class constants declared as public where as declaring class fields as
public is very bad?
Because constants can't be changed. If a class field was public it would be easy to change

 Why should container classes not have INPUT and OUTPUT?
Because it is a template for the objects it will create. Constructor methods will require imports for the class fields.",5,7

The problem is Im not sure if I should commit to software development or data science.

Data science sounds interesting to me, but I dont know anything about machine learning yet. So far, I only know SQL, a little NOSQL, JDBC. I dont know R, Python, and I havent taken a statistics course since high school.

Part of me thinks I should pursue software because of my current skill set and knowledge base. ALSO, I like the idea of being able to free lance as well so that is a big plus. It seems like data science is less freelance friendly, but if someone could explain to me what they think, that would be great.

I can make android apps with firebase backend, I can make high level websites with html, js and css, I can make wpf desktop software in Visual Studio, I can make robotics projects with an arduino or raspberry pi and I can do basic ML classification tasks.

I know Java, C#, C++(sorta), Python and Javascript. I have made some small projects in these languages.

I am currently working on am android social media app, a maths website with backend, a rc car controlled via xbox controller and machine learning.

I am improving my backend development and learning more about machine learning currently.

Does anyone know some projects that I can do to really stand out to employers. I hear everyone loves rust, so would it be a good idea to try an operating system or something similar? Make a game? Some more robotics prohects? My interests lie in logic, not so much design.

 Please post some ideas or any past experiences, thanks.",2,1
