I would like to know how to create an static ID, like IP address, but static. 
I can only think of two ways to create an ID.
* Blockchain that contains the peer's ID and IP. So you can send direct messages to then, but this wouldnt be anonymous.
* Divide the peers in groups. Lets say that there are two main groups A and B and inside group A and B, there is the groups C and D. Lets say that my ID is AC10, that means that i am the peer 10 in group C inside group A. Everytime someone needs to send me a message, the message will pass throught peers from A and AC. It would be an anonymous system.

Any ideia of how to make an ID that is static?

I am to show that if Experimental Cuisine is solvable in polynomial time, then so is 3-SAT.

That means, if I'm right, we just show that 3-SAT reduces to EC, yes? That is, we show that if 3-SAT reduces to EC, then 3-SAT is no harder than EC. If EC is solvable in polynomial time, then so will 3-SAT since it's no harder than EC.

Okay, so here is the description of EC:

Given a list of n possible ingredients numbered 1 to n, we want to choose the maximum number of ingredients that ""go well"" together based on a discord rating. The discord rating of two different ingredients is a real number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is perfect compatibility and 1.0 is something Gordon Ramsay wouldn't even feed to the dumpster.

So, an example discord matrix is:

D | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 
---|---|----|----|----|----
**1** | 0.0 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.9 | 1.0
**2** | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 1.0 | 0.2 
**3** | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.0 | 0.8 | 0.5
**4** | 0.9 | 1.0 | 0.8 | 0.0 | 0.2 
**5** | 1.0 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.0 

So, right off the bat, we can see that this is symmetric. Ingredient X will always go well with itself. We also see that ingredient 1 and 5 make something disgusting together.

Now, let us define the penalty of combining a set of ingredients for a solution as the sum of all discord values between pairs of ingredients.

Thus, a set of ingredients {1,3,5} has the penalty of 0.2 + 1.0 + 0.5 = 1.7. That is, the penalty of {1,3} + {1,5} + {3,5}. We want to make this penalty at most some amount p.

So, we can define EC as:

Input: n, the number of ingredients; D, the nxn discord matrix; some positive number p.

Output: The maximum number of ingredients we can choose with a penalty at most p.

So, back to the original question, how do we reduce 3-SAT to EC to show that if EC in P, then so is 3-SAT?

Ie, throughout your whole Computer Science bachelor you are working on 1 project. Each course/unit you learn, you apply that knowledge to this one project. 

Things I can think of:  

- Develop a simple Operating System   
- Develop a cross-platform cross-application API (by cross-application I mean; desktop application, web application, smart-phone application)   
- Develop a programming language (incl compiler)

In general I am not too comfortable with getting the average case for the number of comparisons so some general steps or tips here would be helpful.

A(N) =  P(Ii)T(Ii)

P(Ii)= 1/n   (value is equally likely to occur in any position in the array)

So the title above basically indicates where I'm going with this. I'm a student who took the Java CS class at our school with little background knowledge. At first I scored pretty well on the first few tests, but then on my most recent test I scored a 33% (F), which dropped my grade down from a low A to a high C. The class continues to grow harder and harder, and although I understand the concepts, I'm having a hard time applying them and using them on the tests. How can I prepare myself (other than looking back on notes) for the final? ",11,3

The first two years I was screwing around and not taking myself seriously and landed a 1.5 GPA attempting to do my classes for Accounting. At the end of the second year (and failing Accounting 1A twice), I decided Accounting was just not for me. I looked into Computer Science and found out that it was something that I understood and can work out. 

Starting my 3rd year, I have been trying to repair my GPA and have taken myself fairly seriously in restarting my education. I am currently taking some intro/intermediate programming courses in C++ and Java and retaking some classes that I failed on the side. 

I want to transfer to a UC or CSU and I know I have a long way before I can even think about applying.

However, I feel a bit lost in how I should proceed with this path. I would like to get some work experience in a relative field (even something as simple as cellphone repair) or perhaps an internship. 

I want to build up a portfolio of ""stuff"" but I have no idea how to get started. 

My question is: 

1. Is now a good time to even consider internships or should I focus solely on my education? 

2. There a ton of different fields in CS, and I have no idea how to even begin to figure out what I want to go into. Where do I begin my research? 
 
3. I would like to take a variety of courses to figure out what I want to do -- what different courses are recommended to get a better understanding of what there is?

4. I want to network with other people in the similar field. Are there communities or outlets I should check out to meet up and socialize with beginners like me as well as expertise in the field? 

5. Do you have any other recommendations/opinions/ideas that I could benefit from?

Today i'm here becuse i would like to ask for cool ideas/problems that i could use as my Computer Theory project.

The only requirement of the project is that we need to create some kind of automata that solves or presents something, it can't be too simple or too hard. For an example one of the groups is going to present an automata that solves the towers of hanoi.

We can use all kind of automatas, pushdowns, turing machines, non-deterministc and etc...

76,2016-11-11,2016,11,11,2,5c8wt6,Beginner at programming starting with C++. Is it a good idea?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/5c8wt6/beginner_at_programming_starting_with_c_is_it_a/,Hiromin,1478797246,"Hello everyone.

I have a very modest background in programming. I only studied CS for 2 years in high school (it only offered that much). And in my high school (and country) we only learn Pascal as a language, and basic algorithm.

I'm interested in doing a CS major in a few years (if you're wondering why ""in a few years"", it's because currently I'm a med student). I've always enjoyed programming and CS classes. The challenge to write the best algorithm and program to solve the problem, and to make that program work, has always felt so fullfilling and thrilling. (I only went into medical field because family wanted me to be a physician). Anyway. So meanwhile, I thought I'd teach myself programming to be as ready as I could for my future CS classes.

I also would like to make PC video games in the future, and Unreal Engine's visual performance looked really appealing to me (I loved the visuals in Life is Strange so much), and I found that Unreal Engine used C++. So I decided to start with learning C++, before Python or Ruby or Java or any other languages more recommended for beginners.

I started watching some tutorials on youtube (by thenewboston), and I found that C++ was a lot less intimidating and its syntax easier to grasp than what many people online made it out to be. (I truly went into it with the expectation to be dealing with some alien impossible language). And I successfully did my first program yesterday (no it was not ""Hello World!"" haha. I wanted a more challenging one so I did a sum function that I called in main and let the user choose the 1st and 2nd value with keyboard). The syntax is different, but I felt that C++'s approach to different steps of the program is very similar to Pascal and the algorithm. That's just how I felt, not necessarily true, but it did make understanding it easier for me.

So, I wanted to ask you, should I continue with C++ or should I stop and switch to easier languages? Like, does this harm my learning ability of other languages or maybe would have some bad consequences on my programming later on? Right now I'm keeping up well enough with any new information I encounter. The 'class' notion was kinda the hardest I encountered till now, but again, nothing seems impossible or out of reach. I heard the learning curve is bad though. Is it only the beginning that looks easy and things will get taugh after a while? Will I encounter hard stuff later on that I can't understand unless I've learned other languages first? Should I continue with C++ if I am not finding it hard to learn, finding it really interesting, and feeling motivated to learn it and improve in it as much as I can?

And thank you!",30,12

I'm currently an undergrad student at a university. The past year I have been struggling to find my major and eventually found myself looking towards the CS field. I am currently taking my second CS course on C++ and I can say that out of all the classes (they were mostly GEs, anyway) I've taken, I found my CS class to be the class I've been most interested in. I did not find school enjoyable until I was finally enrolled in the CS class. I'm not the best in the class, obviously, and there are times when I have difficulty understanding and coding, but the class has motivated and inspired me to keep learning. I was able to finally set goals for myself and get an idea of which direction I want to go. I also know for a fact that I want to keep moving forward and improve my coding skills so that I can create my own projects and share them to the world. I want to express my creativity through coding, and the goal of being able to create my own app, or possibly working with AI in the future is what keeps me going. 

However, recently, I was told by a friend (who I think is very great at CS) that CS doesn't really click with me. I was grateful that he was being honest with me, but it was also sad and unmotivating to hear that. Sure, I am not the best at CS, but for the first time in my college career, the CS class has helped me gain motivation to learn and improve. 

Anyways (sorry for the tl;dr background about myself), I would like to know if anyone (or anyone you know) who is currently in the CS major/field has had someone told them that they weren't good, or that CS didn't ""click"" with them. I know there's always going to be people who are better than others, and it's not good to compare yourself to others, but has there been a time where someone really made you feel like you should give up? I know I don't want to, but should I stop trying to get into the field of CS because it doesn't ""click"" with me? 

Also, if it matters, I am taking a linear algebra class as well. I know math is definitely important in CS, and although I'm not the best at math either, I have the motivation to learn it. 

Honest answers are appreciated, and thanks for reading this far. ",12,14

Has anyone here tried teaching computer science and/or programming to their kids?

I'm a software engineer and a computer science teacher. I would like to bring accessible and fun programming skills to kids. The younger, the better. I found that kids with programmer parents get into computer science early and they are able to

* think through and decompose problems easily
* create their own systems and games
* strategize
* develop an actionable, learn-by-doing mentality early

I find these traits invaluable in kids and would like to develop them not only in children with parents in the software industry.

To be able to help in the best way, I'd like to know

* 1 - if you tried to teach programming to kids in any way
* 2 - what you tried and if you've had success
* 3 - what was the best and worst thing about what you used
* 4 - what you and your kid would like to see to make the learning fun, useful and engaging

Im interested in taking a CS major, and Im trying to make my college list.

This is the maximum that I could narrow down

- Brown University
- California Institute of Technology
- Columbia University
- Cornell University
- Dartmouth College
- Duke University
- Harvard College
- Harvey Mudd College
- Massachusetts Institute of Technology
- Northwestern University
- Pomona College
- Princeton University
- Rice University
- Stanford University
- Tufts University
- University of Chicago
- University of Pennsylvania
- University of Southern California
- Vanderbilt University
- Washington and Lee University
- Washington University in St. Louis
- Yale University

1) Which of those colleges do you NOT recommend for a CS major please? (I need to narrow it down more 22 is too much)
2) After graduation, Id like to work in California state. Would studying in a college from another state affect badly my chances?
3) Which of these colleges communities have the least presence in CA?
4) Would you recommend other colleges and universities that I should add to my list?

Note: Im an international student, in case that affects anything.

Edit: I'm avoiding public schools because they don't give scholarships to international students, and my family cannot afford to pay for them. Are there any exceptions, some public schools that do give full-need met for internationals?

Note 2: I still havent taken the SAT yet, so I cant know which are reaches /matches/safeties from this list for me. But Im aiming for +1530. So lets assume everything will go as planned for now. If not, Ill have to update my list accordingly later.

One way to do that is by having tons of humans audit the results of a particular algorithm, but the purpose of machine learning algorithms is to allow us to comfortably outsource the burden of time spent thinking onto computers. 

So, is there a library for programmers to include that allows them to easily add self-auditing modules into their apps? If not, why?

By self-auditing modules, I'm thinking of a program that checks itself and says to a human, ""I have a % of bias on this output that I'm providing you""",0,3

I posted this question a few months ago in ask science and never received a response- so I'm hoping maybe you guys can explain this to me?  

At their most basic level, computers are series of switches right?
As a hypothetical- maybe an early 'computer' was just a 12x12 grid of switches, and all 144 could be independently controlled to complete different circuits for light bulbs or something.  

These switches could be set off with a timer, or manually controlled or based on a photocell or any mixture of these. 

These controls are where my question arises... they're all manual; they're based on a physical action- like a timer rotating into position, or a flick of a finger, or a semiconductor reacting to the changes in a photocell.  

How did electric impulse controls start existing? In other words- what is the mechanism that tells a switch how to read binary code? A computer 'reads' programming as a series of which circuits to complete (again boiled down as basic as it gets)- but how does it do that?

The reason why I want to become an A.I researcher is because I want to create a mind, a consciousness that can act just like a human being. I learned that I need to get into a good university to learn what I need, so I studied hard and I'm doing pretty good so far. 

But then I began to think there should be more that I need to prepare other than school works. I googled about Ray Kurzweil, one of the most famous A.I researcher, and found out that he had his computer to compose a song when he was around my age. I was impressed, and I found out that many other head researchers of nowadays also knew a lot more than me about computers and algorithms and A.I when they were around my age. This inspired me to write this post in spite of my short English.

 * What are the things that the best researchers of A.I knew when they were young, and how can I learn them?
 * What exactly do I need to prepare from now on to achieve my goal(creating an artificial general intelligence)?",9,8

So, a while ago I started using ""Programming Principles and Practice Using C ++"". I'm really enjoying it. It's quite easy to follow, and it explains not only the language syntax, but how to think like a programmer. I am at chapter 5 at the moment.

However, I've been feeling guilty about something lately. I'm aware just reading a book isn't an effective way to learn. You have to balance practice and reading. The problem is that I can't find the time to practice. I'm even reading the book as a pdf on my phone, and squeezing the time to read a bit everyday: while waiting for the prof to come to class, sometimes during a boring class, even when doing homework at home. During all of these moments I don't have access to my computer and am just on phone, so I can't even practice. Moreover, I'm sacrificing time that I'm supposed to be spending on my med studies. I only have a 30 min break a day, and during that time I barely can finish one practice exercise, not enough to keep up with the amount that I read. I've thought of holding on a bit on reading till I can practice more, but I'm worried It'd take me forever to finish the book then, giving the little amount of real free time I have. Plus, reading the book like this (on the expense of my studies, and in secret of my parents) is starting to kinda stress me...

Don't get me wrong, it's not that I'm hating to learn C++. It's the other way around. I'm enjoying it so much, that I'm feeling like my *other studies* (med school) are so boring and uninteresting... I already didn't like them before (that's why I even decided to change my major to CS), but now I can't even concentrate on ""being patient"" and working on them to finish those two remaining years... It feels like I'm wasting my time, my effort... years on my life on something that I don't like, like I'm just postponing following my dreams for no reason. Right now, if it was up to me, I'd be revising for the SAT (that my parents are really underestimating), working on my college applications (that they're underestimating too, thinking it could be finished in the less than 2 weeks of holidays I have in summer...), and learning C++ and eventually start my own projects; instead of spending 14+ hours a day studying something that I hate...

To be honest... sometimes I wonder if I really should be doing any of this, and that's discouraging me. I was supposed to work hard this year to not have to repeat any exams like last year, but I'm starting to find even more reasons to ""procrastinate"" now, and instead spend the time doing SAT exercices, making my college list, doing research about financial aid, and learning C++, ""wasting"" time that's supposed to be spent on med studies (whether in class or at home). But I really find all of those way more interesting and more useful for my future plans than med studies that I'm going to drop out from eventually anyway... Those tasks -even when many consider them tedious- feel way more fulfilling and interesting than any med lesson I have ever had to study for (except psychology/psychiatry).

Geh I went off-topic. What I wanted to know is that, is it really that bad to only read the book? That's the most I can do right now. Or is it a waste of time, and find out I didn't get anything out of it once I finish reading the book? Should I take it slowly and only move to the next chapter once I finished all of the exercices of the previous chapter, even if it'd probably take me over a year to finish the book in that case? (Noting that I don't plan on stopping at the beginner level, I'll read intermediate level and -if I found time- advanced level books later too). Or it is not that catastrophic and I should continue what I'm doing right now?",25,8

  What I want to know is whats being done in interfacing different analysis engines like Watson and DeepMind?

 If you had a well trained platform could you not use it to train another platform?

 Could you instead train two platforms separately from the same or a specialized data set and have them compare results and in turn refine their own results? 

  I have heard a lot of these platforms require annotated data sets, is it possible to use a platform that works differently to generate an annotated data set for another platform? 

   Edit: How do I get a company to let me use their platform for development of my meta-platform? Most of these companies operate on expensive licensing or a cost per search basis. However by utilizing their service my user is also their user, could I simply pay the service provider 90% or some such of what I make off of using their service? ",0,2

You send your document to an email address that looks like a unique ID (as in assigned to that specific printer) and the printer prints it. You don't have to be in the same network as the printer for it to print your document. I'm curious on how it works. The printer is in his house, behind a router so in a private network, so I don't see how it could be running a public email server to receive emails. My guess is that it has an email client and periodically fetches an email server to see if it received any new documents. If it did, then it downloads and prints them, then the doc is deleted on the server. However, that seems pretty inefficient knowing that printers aren't used that frequently in the typical home so having it reach out to the email server periodically seems like a waste. Thoughts?",3,3

I'm currently having issues comprehending (what should be) a somewhat easy concept regarding UNIX commands. Let me provide you all with an example to get started. 

Consider the following command line:

fee ""fye | $foe"" (backquote)fum $flip(backquote) flop 'flap' &lt; junk

For each of the eight words (fee, fye, foe, fum, flip, flop, flap and junk) on the command line, the shell will identify each as one of:

a) A command b) A file c) A variable d) An argument e) Part of an argument


In the example above, we can easily identify both fee, and fum as commands. Fee starts the line to begin with, and the first field inside something that is backquoted will be interpreted by BASH as a command. foe and flip are variables, as seen by their $. 

The question: How can we easily identify what is an argument, or part of an argument when the commands are written in a format such as above? If I'm not mistaken, a ""part of an argument"" should simply be a command that more or less works in conjunction with the command before it on the command line? How can we decipher an argument from part of an argument? 

Thanks!",2,2

I'm a guy from the UK who just graduated from a computer games programming degree. It was pretty specific to games but I got to explore artificial intelligence and even did my final thesis on machine learning driven physics locomotion.

So I've basically started my degree interested in games programming and finished completely capable of doing so, but yearning for a field more like artificial intelligence with some more complicated computer science stuff (whatever that means). It's got to the point where I'm imagining myself performing these great feats of programming/engineering whereas in reality I don't think that's what it's going to be like at all.

I'm pretty much stuck envisioning the rockstar AI / computer science positions and it's burning away at my mind and I guess I just need someone to just set me straight and give me some reality. Whether that's a path I can take towards a career in AI/ML or if its some hard truths about what I can actually accomplish.

Anyone have any advice?

I was afraid to go to college for math when I started because I didn't think I could do it.

so I avoided going to school for anything I liked or that was worth a career even and just bullshitted around. I had lots of problems and ended up giving up completely, but I did rescue my college career from failure, I came back to school, and brought my GPA up pretty decent (idr what it was, but it was still up to a bare minimum to get into a nursing program which I don't want to do, but it was really great considering I had two wrong majors and failed basically a whole years worth of classes between two schools because I was depressed and lost and not serious.

I graduated with lib arts a.s., but because I had problems and had to quit for 2 years and fix my life so none of my math classes count anymore. and they aren't letting me take a double major in lib arts math science because I already HAVE a lib arts humanities degree.

so I am paying out of pocket for like 3-4 classes. and I'm not even sure I can do them. I will have trigonometry and pre-calc at the same time and the only math class I have taken in 3 years is this algebra class, I took stats 5-6 years ago and passed, but idr any of it.

I'm very scared I will fuck up and not do good enough.

I want to get into computer science with some kind of minor, but for now I'm trying to get the c.s. associates

I don't want to go necessarily for a 'career' but because I actually always enjoyed programming and was frustrated because I never had anyone to really teach me other than tutorials so I wasn't able to ask questions and learn dynamically with help 

so really I figured learning about computer science would give me the power to work on my own with it and maybe use something I like and have ideas about to basically work for myself maybe as a contractor or an app developer or something idk yet.

I also am interested in networking, security and anything else I can learn about.

but I have to get through these math courses.

and even though I enjoy programming -- I used to make websites as a little kid (like 10-12) and they were shitty but I really enjoyed coding. I loved learning basic at that age, and I quickly ended up adopting c/c++ which ended up being all I ever use.

but I just poke around from time to time really. I try to set out on an ambitious project and I get really really close. but then I run into problems I don't know how to solve and I try for days until my eyes bleed and I haven't slept for days.

I do it because I want to figure it out and understand and have the finished product. I always feel like, if only someone taught me how to do this in theory so I understood first what was wrong.

if only I wasn't just hacking away with what I read in some tutorial, modifying it, but actually having a deeper understanding.

but I'm investing a lot in this. I don't know what else to do with anything, but I know humanities degrees are absolutely trash. I don't want to be a lawyer, even if I'm great at arguing. I'm psychotic and would get myself in trouble for my extreme views.

am I stupid for this? I'm almost out of a basic algebra class and I'm not really amazing at it, Ive passed but I would not have made it through a more rigorous course, because there are a few types of problems I cant solve. Ive hovered around 85-95% with fairly lenient professor, I would've passed but maybe I deserved 75-80... he knew I tried hard and really care I think.

but now I found out they were wrong in advising me and I have two more prerequisite classes to take before I have enough financial aid. I can only get part time aid because two of the classes don't count -- trigonometry and precalc

I'm scared that maybe this algebra class I took wasn't enough to get through these next two, its all I have to remember and rely on walking into these without aid.

because if I fail I will have to keep paying again and again.

and whats worse is that I live in the lowest level of poverty. I make minimum wage `19 hrs a week and live with parents whom are on a fixed income. I was in a bad place and am rebuilding everything.

its really crushing me, I might be able to get loans to get into theses classes but probably not because I'm only part time officially even though I'm taking 12-14 credits.

I will have to work less to pass school which means I will be even more impoverished and I am basically having to take important life money from my family to do this.

I don't want to fail. I want to do good at something and try something. I'm scared I'm just picking the wrong thing because I like it on something. or that I just cant do it.

I'm scared I will be reduced to being a criminal to make enough money to pay for this because I don't know what I will even do, I have no plans and no security at this point. 

I don't know if I should give up now and spare myself the pain and just become a full time minimum wage slave forever. or, just give up entirely. a lot of times I feel like there is no hope and I should have killed myself instead of trying to fix things. 

I'm probably going to lose my ability to study halfway through even if I do well. something will happen. someone will die, a crisis will happen, something. IM at the absolute poverty level, living with fixed income elderly family with nowhere else to go and no prospects for jobs outside minimum wage and I wont be driving for a few years

I will be totally alone in the world without any ability to even get a job or drive anywhere and I will be in the most frozen rural area ever outside of Russia or Alaska (upstate NY)

I have no money in reserves, and basically everything I Have and make goes towards what I need.

I can save money but it wont be enough in time. I wasn't ready for this because they told me I would be able to go full time this semester and they were wrong.

should I even commit to this? should I even commit to anything?

should I just drop out again now?

I don't know what I will do with my life other than work at fast food or maybe a restaurant if I'm lucky. but I hate the stress of a serious kitchen and always fuck shit up somehow in that situation eventually. its not easy.

fast food is easy but its no way to survive. it might get better in terms of hours with trump in office because of no Obamacare.

but I don't want that out of my life.

I just have to try to commit so much to this, and its so sad that I qualify for tons of aid but I cant redeem it because they wont let me major in anything that includes simple math classes, just because I am an alumni.

I don't understand why I cant just start a degree from scratch in math and science and then switch, but I had to go directly to CS and basically pay my way all the way until the pre reqs were done (so basically I have to pay for like 3-4 classes which wouldn't be bad if I had been in a situation to work more and save more money but I have no car and got lucky with a local part time job.

should I just give up on this now? Or should jump ship and take a useless humanities bachelors and virtually gain no advantage?

should I be afraid that I wont be good enough or I'll start to hate this even though I didn't before once I learn more about it? I feel like I know a lot, and want to know more but don't understand.

but I don't know if that's just a fantasy. I can barely even tell anymore. I'm so isolated and I don't even know if I should have confidence in trying. because maybe I'm just a fraud.

216,2016-11-27,2016,11,27,8,5f2bjt,Question about differences between hash table implementations and their operation performance,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/5f2bjt/question_about_differences_between_hash_table/,ConfuciusBateman,1480203327,"Hopefully it's okay to post this kind of question in this sub, it seems like an appropriate place but please redirect me if this isn't the right kind of content. Anyway, I have an assignment in one of my CS courses that involves two different hashtable implementations, and I just want to make sure I understand them. One is a hashtable with chaining, fixed at a size of 10,000. The other is a hashtable with double hashing. 

As far as I understand, the first one will have 10,000 slots right? We're not told what the hashing function is, and we're only filling it up with positive integers, so I'm guessing that after inserting 10,000 integers, collisions would start occurring?

And with the the double hashing implementation, I believe that this is meant to avoid collisions with a second hash function (should a collision happen after the first hash function).

So now my question is, how would these two hash tables differ in performance? Would the first one start to suffer from worse insert times after, say, a 3rd cycle of 10,000 integers? Would this even be noticeable? Because with an input of 30,000 integers, wouldn't it have 3 links in a chain at each slot between 0 - 9,999? I don't see that as having a noticeable performance decrease. Essentially, I'm imagining that the hash table with chaining will see a decrease in speed for inserting, finding, and removing items, but I'm not sure if it would be noticeable.

And then for the hash table that is resizable with double hashing, would it simply not suffer from the issues that the table with chaining would (the table becoming full and chains growing at different slots)? Sorry for the long post, any insight would be great on how these two different hash table implementations would contrast in terms of the performance of operations on them. Thanks in advance.",3,1

Is it worth going to a big school for this degree?

Is there a huge drop off between getting a minor instead of a major in CS?

Any extra info? Thanks!

My problem is that I kind of know which statements/ expressions I would need and which technique I kind of would have to use to make this work but I always have problems actually typing it down and phrasing the code. I think I still struggle to ""think like a computer"". I'm not sure if this problem is common among students who have just started coding. I'm starting to think that I might not be cut out for coding (which makes it even more frustrating) but I would love to make it work somehow! :-(

So if possible, can anyone recommend me a good website or any techniques/ tips on how to become better at coding in C? I would be more than grateful!
