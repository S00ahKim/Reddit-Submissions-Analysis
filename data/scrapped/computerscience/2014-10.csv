I have always been interested in computer science but I have been avoiding it since I am not good at math.I failed pre calculus in high school but that may have been because it was senior year and I gave up within the first semester.  I am currently taking an introductory math class but I plan on taking pre calculus next semester since most computer science programs require it as a pre requisite.

I helped out at my old middle school working on the laptops and desktops there (mostly just doing diagnostic checks and installing laptop images), but as far as building my own computer, or creating my own website from scratch or anything like that I have no real idea what I'm doing. As far as building my own computer, I'm in the process of trying to scrounge up money to build one, but being in college, that isn't going so well. It just feels like everyone and their mother has so much in-depth experience with hardware and software, (everyone I talk to has opinions on the latest and greatest hardware and seems to be up to date on things), where as I feel like I don't know much.

Does anyone have any tips for how to get started growing a wider experience base? Currently I only know basic java from a series of 2 programming courses I have taken so far and very VERY introductory Visual Basic from a high school programming course that was offered.",3,2

I started working back in mid-July and haven't been terribly thrilled with the experience. I miss the sense of community, cooperation, and curiosity that came of constantly working in a CS lab pursuing common interests but I'm also routinely disinterested with my work and have trouble maintaining the discipline to complete my responsibilities. Thus far, very little of my time has been spent working with computer science related concepts and I have written perhaps a dozen lines of code.

Instead I largely use software that requires a CS background to understand and operate but which is not itself terribly interesting. For instance, we're doing some data processing work that's being done in Hadoop. In order to use Hadoop I have to be familiar with Python, Java, MapReduce, some SQL, etc. but the actual work that I do is attempting to get a scripting language to work, getting Hadoop to recognize all of our remote drives, pasting some code from an outside contractor in, and that sort of thing. All fairly menial tasks that simply require a large amount of background knowledge and persistence to do. When I go into work tomorrow I'll be loading some XML data into a Fedora repository for use as a back-end. After that I might help some interns wireframe a UI for a web front end. Based on conversations with my manager, this is what I can expect in future.

Speaking to my friends who have recently graduated and been hired by financial firms and similar, this seems to be a common experience for them as well, although one of them has done a little bit of development in COBOL.

I originally went to school to become a history teacher but after taking an introductory computer science course I enjoyed the discipline so much that I dropped my education major to pursue it. I remained strongly passionate about computer science throughout the 4 years, took extra classes, did research projects over the summer, and developed some software for local non-profits. After only a few months of working in the field my interest in remaining within the field is waning.

A little background info, I'm a high school drop out that in the last year taught myself math concepts form pre algebra through trigonometry with tutoring dvds. I realized I like math and school. I really dont know why I hated school so much in the past.

Im in my late twenties, and decided I wanted to major in computer science even though I have no experience programming. I've always loved structuring solutions to problems, and finding creative ways to use the tools i have to solve those problems. 

Anyways, Im in my second semester of community college, all A's and doing fine with every subject, in the honors program, and now I hit this Intro to Java class. I was fucking destroyed. Ill admit I got a late start on the class, but holy shit there was a lot of work. The first week we had to write 4 algorithms, and prior to this class I had no idea what an algorithm formally was or how to write one. Every week thereafter we had to write psuedocode and 3 programs that took about 3-8 hours each, 50 or so pages of reading, and 40-60 homework problems in ""my programming lab."" Not to mention he graded work like we were supposed to be experts. I started falling behind in other classes because I was spending twice as much time on this class and my other classes. When I spent enough time to catch up on my other classes, i fell behind in java. I never caught up with my java class again.

I researched the teacher on ""ratemyprofessors.com"" he has a bad review, but any other comp sci teacher i look at has a bad review. The reviews all say ""class moves too fast, dont tkae this class, teacher is too hard!"" etc.. So i got the idea that comp sci is just a difficult subject for most. I also read articles about how some people are meant to code, and some arent. This casts even more doubts.

I worry either that I am not cut out for this, even though I do OK, the class pace is just too fast for me even at a community college level. On top of that, I don't have a great sense for applying math yet, as in the past year ive learned all the mechanics of math concepts from high school. The application of math concepts seems entirely crucial in structuring problems in algorithms. This is slowly developing, but it doesn't feel like I will be ready to perform to expectations of these classes anytime soon.

I only got about 50% of the work done, and had a D with a lot of work invested already. All I could think was that I was going to fail. So, I dropped the course to avoid it from affecting my GPA. So I don't know if I should change majors, or take the java class again, only this time with 12 credit hours instead of 15.

**tl;dr** I had to drop my java class because I couldnt perform at the level my comp sci teacher expected. Fell behind in other classes, then fell behind in intro to java class. Dropped intro to java to fix other classes and avoid it from affecting my GPA. Are all teachers hard, and are there truly people not cut out for this major?",3,0

1. You have a PC with a 2 GHz processor, a system bus clocked at 400 MHz, and a 3 Mbps internal cable modem attached to the system buz. No parity or other error-checking mechanisms are used. The modem has a 64-byte buffer. After it receives 64 bytes, it stops accepting data from the network and sends a ""data ready"" interrupt to the CPU. When the interrupt is received, the CPU and OS perform the following actions:

a. The supervisor is called
b. The supervisor calls the modem's ""data ready"" interrupt handler.
c. The interrupt handler sends a command to the modem, instructing it to copy its buffer content to main memory,
d. The modem interrupt handler immediately returns control to the supervisor
e. The supervisor returns control to the process that was originally interrupted
Sending an interrupt requires one bus cycle. A push or pop operation consumes 30 CPU cycles. Incrementing the stack pointer and executing an unconditional BRANCH instruction require one CPU cycle each. The supervisor consumes eight CPU cycles searching the interrupt table before calling an interrupt handler. The ""data ready"" interrupt handler consumes 50 CPU cycles before returning to the supervisor.

Incoming packets are 64 bytes. The ""transfer complete"" interrupt consumes 30 CPU cycles before returning to the supervisor if it doesn't detect a complete packet in memory. If it does, it consumes 30 CPU cycles plus one cycle for each 8 bytes of the packet.

Use the following table to determine how long it takes to move a 64-byte packet from its arrival at the modem until its receipt in the memory area of the target application program or service? State your answer in elapsed time (nanoseconds).

I am in an intro computer science class and I had to write some code for this homework project. Every thing is looking good as far as the functions but I can't find an easy way to indent every line 3 spaces except for some lines. Here is just an example of what it needs to look like:

&lt;output&gt;
   
___&lt;output&gt;
   
___&lt;output&gt;

Is there an easy way to do this other than:

System.out.println(""___output2"");

The timeframe to complete either is roughly the same according to my advisor, but I'm going to check into that further. I was just curious to get the perspective of people in the actual field already on which route to take.

My grades are fairly average. Mostly B's except in my actual programming classes which are all A's. I'll be happy to respond with any other pertinent information.

My friend's gf works for a great great company.  I met the gf, and she said to send me her resume, which I promptly did.  Then she let me know that the hiring manager received my resume, and the instruction was to go online, and get all of my information into their system, by applying through one of the available jobs listed.  Because a job that would match my experience and qualifications was not listed, I just picked a job that was at least in a similar department.  I never heard back, and let it go, figuring I was not a match for their company or needs.

&amp;nbsp;

Five months go by, and I receive an email from someone in the company's recruiting department!  This is in reference to the particular job that I ""applied"" to.  When, in reality, in only ""applied to"" that particular role as a means of getting into their system, as per the instructions of the hiring manager.  With this email came an attached list of screening questions.  I covered the finance/accounting portion I think with no problem.  It is this Turing Machine that is catching me up.

&amp;nbsp;

SO!  Do I email the recruiter back, explaining why I applied to that particular job, and with the answers to the accounting/finance questions attached, and explaining that the Turing Machine is outside of my realm, and that if I am not a fit for this particular role, I am still highly interested in the company as a whole, and open to other roles?

&amp;nbsp;

The best case would be to figure out on my own how to do the Turing Machine, and return the email with it attached...having some trouble understanding how to do that, though...

&amp;nbsp;

I kind of want to get back to her today, before the weekend.  Thinking I will send a nice email, attach what I have, and explain why I applied to that particular job that is outside of my realm of education/experience.

If not, please tell me which is or how to find out myself.

I don't have a lot of choices, because the requirements for my case are restricting.

I don't have extensive knowledge in a lot of CS concepts or deep knowledge in almost anything. So when starting development for the given platform, I'm gonna study and self-learn it.

It has to be an active, growing, and rewarding platform. If it doesn't require things like complex database algorithmic techniques like social networking for the web, that would be highly preferred.

I'm a Computer Science student, but still a level 2. My purpose for this is to build a solid portfolio early on and get a head start for when I need it, and to get experience (same thing basically), and also cuz I'm bored as fuck in college, learning slowly is really boring.

Revenue and money is very vital for this. Don't get me wrong, it's not the reason for this, but it is what drives my future projects. Cuz I do need money in the short term (hopefully *short*) for personal reasons.

I'm thinking of Android development, cuz it uses Java and xml, I already know a bit of Java from college and KCPC (local contest before the regional ACPC - I'm from Kuwait), and xml is easy to learn relatively. So the learning curve for Android development isn't that crazy, it's doable. And the market for it is quite decent in comparison to others.

I'm also considering the web, but I need someone to help me with this decision. It's a one time decision and I'm gonna stick to it for a long time.

OH, and another reason for this, is to make me available to professionally freelance much earlier. Which hopefully it turn brings me a much more solid portfolio and more money both much sooner than otherwise.

But as of lately, I've seriously began to think about getting a degree in Computer Science instead. As of right now I'm in community college about to earn an AA in liberal arts (because its suggested for athletes since its the easiest and quickest way to get an AA and transfer). Apart from school, football takes up most of my time. Right now I have a couple of division 1 and 2 football scholarship lined up for next semester. But I'm really not certain with what degree I want to pursue.

In high school, I truly enjoyed my computer academy class. Even up to now, majority of the job opportunities seem to be in CS. Towards the beggining of my senior year, I started leaning more towards criminal justice because it seemed like it required easier classes and also offered about the same amount of jobs after college. I figured that with football taking up 75 percent of my time in college, I really won't be able to handle CS. But after reading all the post on reddit about how useful and valuable a CS degree is, I'm really starting to think about pursuing it, rather than criminal justice.

Since I'm going to be in college completely tuition free, I might as well do something I'm going to enjoy right? The thing I'm most worried about is that most of my knowledge from my computer academy class in high school are completely forgotten. So I'm basically clueless about anything related to computer science. So my question for someone who has their CS degree or someone working on it:

What type of classes were/are you required to take?

How difficult was the classes?

How time consuming was the work outside of class?

*Do you need to have tremendous prior knowledge about the classes?

How are you utilizing your degree after college?

What are the more specific fields of computer science (programming... etc) ?

Is it possible to enroll into masters with my background? I am targeting masters bc of availability of funding so I can sustain. Please suggest. 

I am ready work my ass off for couple of months so that I can do well in CS.",10,2

Sci. While I am pretty confident with my development skills, I still worry that people who have done an internship have the upper edge. Unfortunately, a lot of internship job postings require that I return to school to finish off my degree right after the internship. That being said, I have a couple of questions for you folks:

1. Is it worth delaying my graduation for an internship?
2. Has anyone done a new grad internship? If so, how was it? Any tips on interning as a new grad?
3. For people who didn't do an internship, how was it like finding a job?
4. Any tips on how to create a resume for an internship?

Looking forward to hearing back from you guys!
Thanks :D",2,2
