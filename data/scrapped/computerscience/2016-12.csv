After stopping and starting more times than I care to admit to, I finally signed up for CS50 and decided to work my way through Greg Perry's Absolute Beginner's Guide to C Programming. 

In that book, Code Blocks (using 16.01 right now) is recommended as an IDE (is that the right term?). Now, I first had trouble with it on both Windows and the Mac OS (Windows 8 and OS10.11.6), for whatever reasons programs wouldn't compile. So I fixed that issue and haven't had issues compiling and running programs since. However, I'm at the point now where I'm writing header files and using #include &lt;xyz.h&gt;. #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; causes no issues but for some reason using *my own* .h files seems to prevent the program from compiling and prompts an error message saying 'the current project has not been built yet, would you like to build it?'. Clicking on 'yes' does nothing. I'm wondering if there is a specific location that I'm meant to be saving .h files to that Code Blocks would be reading these files from?

Should I make a project?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/5g3xdl/aspiring_cs_major_currently_learning_c_what_can_i/,Hiromin,1480693671,"Hello everyone.

I'm currently learning C++ basics (learning functions now) on my own, using books and coursera lectures. I'm really enjoying it. I actually am liking the language quite a lot

On the other hand, I also want to start doing some projects to improve my application for college admission next year, in order to show my interest in CS major. I'll be aiming for the top schools (Ivies/MIT/Stanford/Caltech, etc...), so I need my projects to be impactful too.

However, I heard that it takes *a lot* of time to learn enough of C++ to even start making your first project, compared to other languages.

So I wanted to ask if you think I should start learning another language after learning OOP basics in C++, or it is possible to write a good-enough project if I continue learning C++? And what language can I pick up quickly and build good projects with in a short time? (i.e. a couple of months, I need to finish it before next November for admission).

P.S: I'm really learning at a very slow pace, because I'm jaggling C++, the SAT practice and my medical studies (which are taking 90% of my time), so if I'm lucky I do about 3 hours of C++ learning per week.

P.S.2: Even if I switched to another language, I will still continue learning C++ at the same time (the other language will be for the project, and C++ is for my long-term interests), as I'm really enjoying i, and will want to specialise in it in the future, I really see myself having a job in C++.

However I really doubt it could be this convenient though. I doubt I could possibly learn a language (mind you, I'm not talking about mastering it, I'm aware that takes decades to do), and finish a whole good-quality project in the span of a year, while also having to work on med school and study for the SAT...

Might you have any other ideas please? What can I add to my application to show my interest in CS, but also make my CS-related extracurriculars stand out during the admission?

Thank you.",27,18,False,self,,,,,

The obvious answer is to give people some secret ID, and publish everyone's vote so you can look yours up to verify it was not tampered with.  EASY.

BUT...

What about the people who don't trust the state to record their vote properly?  If a dispute arose, it's your word against the government's, and that's not going to work.  So, my thinking is that if you had a receipt showing how you voted, any discrepancy between the database and your receipt would be proof of tampering.  

BUT...

How do you prove that your receipt was not itself tampered with?  Since neither party can be trusted to not change their data, how do you keep a record digitally that both of you know is the original?  And without adding any more people to the mix, can you?  I know BTC does this by just having a large pool of people, but for voting, the Govt would easily have &gt;50% of the network, so that would not be a satisfactory solution.

[A Field Guide to Genetic Programming](http://dces.essex.ac.uk/staff/rpoli/gp-field-guide/A_Field_Guide_to_Genetic_Programming.pdf)

Since both - neural networks and computer programs - take input data and turn it into output data, as far as I know they can be used to solve the same kind of problems. 
I guess one could also see neuro-evolution as a sub-category of genetic programming.

Now I have to wonder: Which types of problems are more fit to be solved by neural networks and which might be better solved by programs (more specifically syntax trees)?

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy but intend to pursue a master's in Computer Science, and so have been looking at programs like the Master's Program in Computer Science at UChicago and the Computer Science and/or Software Engineering programs at University of Texas at Dallas that are known for accommodating to those with a bachelor's in unrelated subjects who have little to no experience in computer science. I have one major concern regarding the strength of my application. During my time as an undergraduate, I also earned a minor in mathematics. First semester of my senior year, I needed one more course to complete this minor, so I decided to try out Discrete Mathematics. The course was geared toward mathematics majors and not computer science majors and was thus much more academic/theoretical/not applied/difficult. Halfway through the semester, I withdrew from the course because I was failing. I already had all my other requirements done and plenty of credit hours to graduate, and still had a semester left to take another course for my math minor. However, because I was only taking 12 credit hours including Discrete, I was placed on academic probation for dropping down to 9 hours as part of my school's policy. I would still go on to earn my math minor with another course (Real Analysis), and graduated Cum Laude &amp; Phi Beta Kappa with a 3.8 GPA. With all of this in mind, I have two questions:

1) Would the fact that I was placed on academic probation for one semester simply for dropping below 12 credit hours, in light of the other positive facts I have given about my application, have any sort of negative impact on my application for these types of programs, including those specifically mentioned? I have heard that academic probation can negatively affect one's application for graduate programs.

2) Would the fact that I withdrew from a course like Discrete Mathematics, a subject which is so essential to the understanding of computer science, have any sort of negative impact on my application for these programs? There is obviously the chance to take the course again before entering a master's program, and UChicago's immersion program for inexperienced candidates includes a course called Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science that can be taken before the fall semester begins, but would evidence of my past performance in this subject negatively impact me more than no evidence of past performance (i.e. ""well, it looks like they already performed poorly in this subject in the past, so why should we think they could handle it now"")?",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I am a third-year undergrad planning to pursue graduate study in theoretical computer science, primarily interested in complexity theory and computational learning theory.

Now I am stuck between deciding between a CS major or a math major (can't do both because of double counting rules and heavy gen ed requirements). 

I always hear that it is easy to learn CS on your own, but learning more math is hard, that math courses teach you how to think while CS courses just teach technical knowledge, that graduate schools ""prefer math math majors"" and so on. 

I have many CS courses in conflict with math classes next semester since the departments do not coordinate course offerings. I have to decide on the major and choose four or so courses from the following:

1. Differential topology (Guillemin &amp; Pollack)
2. Representations of finite groups vs ""Advanced Algorithms"" (more a theorist's toolkit kind of class on hashing, convex optimization, spectral graph theory)
3. Alg Top (Hatcher) vs Approximation Algorithms (Vazirani text) vs either of two classes on stochastic calculus and SPDEs
4. Analytic number theory (Davinport) vs Information Theory and Communications Complexity and a class on on boolean function complexity (the latter being based mostly on Junka's two relevant books)
5. Complex variables (usually taught out of Stein &amp; Sakari but this time taught using course notes)
6. Fourier analysis (Stein &amp; Sakari)

We have an Informatics department so I can switch my major from Computer Science &amp; Applied Math to Computer Science with a Minor in Informatics.

You are required to have a minor in our school. And after looking at some of the courses in Informatics:

- Introduction to Data and Databases
- Object Oriented Programming Principles and Practice
- Software Engineering
- Introduction to Web Technologies

OOP and Software Engineering are from the CS department, but they intervene with the minor so I don't need to take any extra classes.

Being in the applied math program means I have to take Calc 3, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations (optional as an elective), and a bunch of heavy math courses.

Has anyone got their MBA or a Master's in MIS with a bachelor's in CS? 
How has it affected your career?

Was it online?

I got my bachelor's in Computer Science about a year and a half ago and have acquired 3 years of full-time work experience (my university required we do 3 - 6 month, full time, internships). All of my work experience has been with Financial companies. 

From reading some of the other threads, I don't think a master's in CS is for me. I am not looking to get into academia or do research.

I was hoping you could help me find a good gift for my little brother for Christmas. He is halfway through his third year and is really enjoying his coursework and projects. I had hoped to get him something related to this field that would help him grow and develop.

We already have micro-controllers, servos, things like that. I was hoping more for something that is theory-based like a good book or some sort of tool that will help him develop his skills.

To try to give you a better idea, i can give you some examples which are more related to my field of study as an electrical engineering major. There is a book called [The Art of Electronics](https://smile.amazon.com/Art-Electronics-Paul-Horowitz/dp/0521809266/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=R86Q5Q7EJ08NX5PNJH7A) that has a corresponding hands-on lab course which is highly regarded among many professional engineers. If there is something analogous to that, I think that would be ideal.

I'LL PROVIDE MY CODE AT THE END OF THE INSTRUCTIONS


Exercise B:
At this point package final1410 should include a file called MyFile.txt
If you missed that step go to package explorer and add the file now.
So far no text has been added to the file. This needs to be done now.

Add the following three numbers to the file - each number in a separate line
2.345

6.4

8.7654321

Create a generic list called numbers and read in all the numbers from MyFile.txt
At this point MyFile.txt includes 3 numbers. However, there could be more or less. If added or removed numbers from MyFile.txt your program should still read in all the numbers available in the file.
When reading numbers from the file you need to be prepared that a checked exception could occur.
In this exercise checked exceptions should be caught and in such situations the stack trace should be printed.

Print the list
Each element should be rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point and the elements should be separated by a space (see output)
Make sure to include a label.

Create a generic method called duplicateElements
It has one parameter, which is a generic List, and it returns a generic list.
The list that is returned should include each element of the original list twice (see example)
e.g. If the original list included 2.345, 6.4, and 8.7654321 then the modified list should include 2.345, 2.345, 6.4, 6.4, 8.7654321, and 8.7654321
Notice the order of the list elements
Also, notice that the list elements are not rounded; only the output is rounded.
In the main method call duplicateElements in order to duplicate the elements of list numbers
Print the list that was returned by the method duplicateElements

Make your output look like the output provided

Sample Output:

list : 2.35 6.40 8.77
double list: 2.35 2.34 6.40 6.40 8.77 8.77

I'm about 10 years into a career where I have done sales, marketing and now manage national products. I have always been interested in coding/programming/ technology. I have a bachelor's in English (I know) with a minor in Business.

I've done HTML/JavaScript/CSS coding academy modules and started the ""Viking Coding Project"", but it's going to just take me too long to do on my own. SO - I'd like to do a formal program on this (like with a university) and it looks like the company I work for my pay for this - which is why I'm trying to learn more about it at the moment.

Right now , I work with a lot of statisticians and Data Science is a potential goal for me. I'm really not sure where to start, so any guidance (or resources) you can provide is appreciated.

My university said that if I want any hope of making it into the graphics grad program, I need to learn the basics of C++ before applying (due next fall). I won't be able to take the animation class that introduces you to C++ until the semester after the application has to be submitted, so I think it'd look really good if I show self-motivation on the application by somehow demonstrating that I began teaching myself C++.

I am currently a network engineer, acting as the networking, virtualization, and Linux SME for my project's small IT team. Previously I've worked on a development team as a QA Engineer (working with Java, Ruby, and C++ test frameworks to create and expand automated test content) and various sysadmin positions. It's been a long, successful career and I've always had work creating nice scripts, supporting web applications, engineering software packages (think SCCM), and occasionally being handed some source code to perform some maintenance programming. However, I've never gotten to actually work as a fulltime programmer, which I've always wanted to do.

Recently I've upped my game a lot recently and have spent some significant effort really learning the full feature-set offered by Java as I am working my way through the remaining classes I have to take. I'm slowly making my way through my BS in Computer Science at UMUC, but it's slow going since I work fulltime, have a wife and child, and have always run into school being an obstacle preventing me from achieving my learning goals. I'm currently at 77/123 credits. I'd like to spend some time learning (modern) C++, Python (which I only write in a non-idiomatic way at this point), and a purely functional language (Haskell maybe-- although if anyone has a good suggestion, I'd be willing to hear them out). UMUC has a laughable curriculum, so learning real things like (modern) C++, functional languages, and how to write idiomatic Python will likely be on my own time.

I'd like to move from an operational role to something more development oriented. My goal is to become a fully-fledged software engineer. My question is whether I'm wasting my time in school. 

Should I be spending my time just building a portfolio of sample work and getting a large personal project under my belt or should I continue at UMUC (which is subsidized to basically the in-state rate)? 

Right now I work for the DoD as a contractor, where having a degree or a cert holds more weight than actually knowing what you are doing, but I am thinking I'll probably be working in the private sector in the next few years. I am also just about to complete the requirements for my 2-year degree, so I could also consider switching to a less ridiculous school (although currently the price is right).",5,13,False,self,,,,,
