I took two very simple programming classes in both C++ and Visual Basic. I had a lot of fun doing the assignments due to the large amounts of flexibility and visual nature of our program outputs. In general I would consider myself to be a very visual person, and would love to work on something such as websites, small games, mobile apps, etc.  
  
Ever since college however, I feel like I have lost a lot of the passion I had for it. Before I would work on extra things at home, but now it is such a struggle and chore to finish my assignments. I find them to be so very abstract and difficult. Nothing like what I would actual want to be working on in the future and nothing I really feel proud of upon finishing.  
  
So far I have taken an intro to Java class, and I am just starting class on data structures and another on discrete math. And I am worried I will keep waiting for the ""fun"" classes to come in the future and then they never do. Sorry for the long post, but I am for the first time starting to question my major. Seems unnatural for me to dread the assignments for my major the most of any of my classes. I go to UW Madison by the way if that helps at all. Thanks for any suggestions!",5,5,False,self,,,,,

It was the same question both times, multiple choice. I got it right both times, but I don't really think I understand it. Here goes:

&gt;The [DFA](http://i.imgur.com/MnmREPr.gif) in question.

 &gt;This DFA accepts a certain language L. In this problem we shall consider certain other languages that are defined by their tails, that is, languages of the form (0+1)*w, for some particular string w of 0's and 1's. Call this language L(w). Depending on w, L(w) may be contained in L, disjoint from L, or neither contained nor disjoint from L (i.e., some strings of the form xw are in L and others are not).

&gt;Your problem is to find a way to classify w into one of these three cases. Then, use your knowledge to classify the following languages:

&gt;* L(1111001), i.e., the language of regular expression (0+1)*1111001.
* L(11011), i.e., the language of regular expression (0+1)*11011.
* L(110101), i.e., the language of regular expression (0+1)*110101.
* L(00011101), i.e., the language of regular expression (0+1)*00011101. 

&gt;a)  	L(1111001) is neither disjoint from L nor contained in L.

&gt;b)  	L(1111001) is contained in L.

&gt;c)  	L(1111001) is disjoint from L.

&gt;d)  	L(110101) is disjoint from L.
 
&gt;Answer submitted:   c)
&gt;You have answered the question correctly. 

My question is: what exactly does the notation (0+1)*w mean? Does the (0+1) part just represent a string with any sequence consisting of 0's and 1's? This is what I thought it was. I asked the professor, but he gave me an answer that he just copy-pasta'd from the exam's solution guide.

My line of thinking was that if this is the case, I could just test *w* as though my initial state was B, C, or D...

Write a program that will prompt the user for a date and determine its validity. If the date is invalid, an error message should be displayed explaining precisely where the error is. If the date is valid, the program should compute the day of the year. 

Computing the number of days in February
During leap years, there are 29 days in February. During non-leap years, there are exactly 28 days. To be a leap year, the year must be evenly divisible by 4.

Century years are leap years only if they are evenly divisible by 400. The years 1600 and 2000 are leap years. 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years.

In engineering I've covered programming (C, C++), microprocessors and logic. Before that, a bit of the following: data structures, databases, networking, computer architecture, programming (VB.NET). I've also pursued more programming (Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript), and a looked at a bit of compilers and interpreters on my own.
