Straight through proxy that changes nothing but your IP address. This is the fastest.

Im currently studying abroad in France, but when I get back home, I will try to start aggressively networking with my professors and friends. I do have a good relationship with three professors Ive had, and Ive thought about asking them if I could do some work for them.

During my last Data Mining course I discovered the world of spectral graph analysis and how useful can those tools be in terms of describing a graph. 

One of the most amazing things I learned was how the eigenvectors associated to the laplacian matrix are embeddings that can be useful when it comes to cluster graphs for example.

To preface this, I always wanted to go to Hogwarts as a kid and learn magic. I became somewhat disenfranchised with the world as I grew older, but I have recently begun to rekindle a sense of wonder and excitement for the world.

A big part of that has been learning to code. I was thinking about this the other day, and I realized that I have essentially been learning magic by any standard throughout history, and for some reason I take that for granted!

Through a high-level language, we manipulate electrons in order to create symbolic information patterns that can accomplish real tasks - to anyone from any other time in history, if they could see us they would think we were literally witches and wizards.

At Hogwarts the students learn to predict the rough future through magic. I can do the same with data analysis, game theory, and machine learning networks. They can see things from the other side of the world - I just finished coding a security cam for my dorm. They can imbue non-living matter with sentience - robotics. They can manipulate life - bioinformatics - if I had access to the right tools I could literally breed glowing animals. Artificial intelligence adds an even cooler aspect to this given we might soon be able to create sentience from non-sentient matter! Even the bad powers, killing people, controlling people etc are real - consumer programming, psychometric targeting through the internet, drone strikes, malicious hacking, etc.

By extension, everything we are exploring in modern science is really magic. We don't really know how this stuff works or why it works - if you look at the physical constants of the universe they seem somewhat arbitrary. While we do have a good sense of the relational properties between things in reality, we don't know why they are what they are - like electrons! We know the rules that dictate their interaction with other things in reality, but we don't know why they exist the way they do, where they came from, or for that matter where any of this really came from! Somehow through all these layers of abstraction, from basic properties of atoms and forces, to high-level symbolic computation, we manage to actually do stuff, and that stuff is no less absolutely amazing! I don't think it's hyperbole to say that we're all doing real magic.",59,1,False,self,,,,,

Reason I ask is because I'm currently taking my algorithms course in university and I am absolutely drowning. Our reference material is the legendary CLRS textbook, but we're all having a hard time grasping the concepts of it. Our class has about a 50% failure rate, and I'm holding on the best I can, but am always worried that i'll be one of the ones that need to take it next semester.. I'm not really understanding the material at all and we don't really have any time to, as we go through 2 chapters a week (with a few exceptions) and have a quiz on each topic each class (we meet twice a week). The course material is all self-study, as there are lecture videos online, but they just summarize the textbook, and class time is just used for ""group problem solving"". The instructor just kind of feels like a facilitator, as he just reads the solutions from a google document instead of explaining them, and kind of just tells us all to ""do better"" instead of trying to offer any sort of help.. it doesn't really help that the ""lecture"" material isn't even his, he just kind of took it from another instructor.

 Homework assignments are taken directly from the book for the most part, and while there are solutions available, doesn't really give me any fulfillment or satisfaction if all we're doing is just looking up the answers as I am not capable of solving the problems on my own.. I think I might just be better off trying my best to pass the class and just learn the subject at my own pace using other materials like Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos or some other kind of text..

* Started looking for other work paths that I could fit in. Im still kinda young and have some kind of financial stability, enough to pursue a second Bachelor's degree. I decided that I wont go back being a Financial Analyst, because I hated that job, it didnt interest me at all so I didnt have any motivation to develop mysef. Changing my career completely feels like the play here, 4 more years studying to get a new degree. My wife backs me up 100% btw.
* Started looking up which Careers I could be interested in. I've always liked Computers and Technology. Never done any real coding, except for an Excel VBA course that I did a few years ago, but I know its nothing compared to real programming. Watched a few Youtube videos about programming and the routine of a Software Engineers, I was very interested about it, although it only scratched the surface. My main hobby is playing PC games. I also done some Career Online tests, most of them leaned towards IT. I dont really know which IT job I would like... so many options... software developer, security specialist, web developer, software engineer, mobile apps dev, etc.... I really dont know what I would work with.
* **In Brazil, most colleges have 3 main types of IT degrees: Computer Science, Software Engineering and Computer Engineering. I would like to know the difference between them, their job paths, in your experience is there a ""best one"" between them? What do you guys suggest? Has anyone experienced something similar?

As we already discussed in this class, a module is a Python file that contains functions, constants and programmer defined data types (called classes). It is possible to create your own module containing definitions of functions and constants.

As described in preceding module, Python comes with several standard libraries called modules. A module is Python file that has definitions for commonly used functions, constants and data types (called classes).

The math module has definitions for commonly used mathematical functions and constants such as square root, trigonometric functions (cosine, sine, tangent, arc cosine, arc sine, arc tangent, natural exponent and logarithm, logarithm to base 10, and many others) and constants (pi, Euler number-e )

To include (load to memory) specific functions or constants in your program, use

from math import fcn1, fcn2, fcn3, , fcnN

where fcn1, fcn2, fcn3, , fcnN are the functions or constants you want to include.

To include all the functions and constants from the math module in your program, use wildcat.

from math import *

This is equivalent to

import math

See page 263 for some of the functions and constants in the math module.

sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, sqrt, log, log10, floor, ceil (functions), pi and e (constants)

Let us write a program that will display the graphs of sin and cos with x between 0 and 4*pi using turtle graphics. Copy the program and run it.

 
from math import *
from turtle import *
 
def plotAPoint(t,x,y,s):
  t.penup()
  t.goto(x,y)
  t.pendown()
  if s == 'sin':
  t.dot('red')
  elif s == 'cos':
  t.dot('green')
 
def drawTrig(n):
  cos_t = Turtle()
  sin_t = Turtle()
 
  start = 0
  end = 4*pi
  step = (end-start)/n
  setworldcoordinates(0,-1, 4*pi, 1)
  for k in range(n):
  u = k*step
  v1 = cos(u)
  plotAPoint(cos_t, u,v1, 'cos')
  v2 = sin(u)
   plotAPoint(sin_t, u, v2, 'sin')
 
drawTrig(100)
 

 

Activity

For x=0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, what are the values of sin(x), tan(x), cos(x), exp(x), log(x)
For x = -1 + k*0.02, for k =0, 1, 2, , 100, plot acos(x) and asin(x) using turtle graphics. Set the worldcoordinates to -1, -pi/2, 1,  pi.
An engineer of a construction company is interested in finding at least one value of x that will make the function f(x) = x**2   - sin(x) to be zero. The engineer knows that one such value of x is close to pi/2.  Using that as a guess, the engineer decided to find a more accurate value by iteratively computing:

Formula 1: x_new = x_old  f(x_old)



or



Formula 2: x_new = x_old  f(x_old)/ (2*x_old   - cos(x_old)).



Where x_new is the new value of x. We replace the old value  (x_old) with the new value (x_new) in subsequent iterations.



The engineer uses x_new that will satisfy the |x_new-x_old|/|x_old|&lt;1.0e-6 where |a| is the absolute value of a. Here, 1.0e-6 is called error tolerance  the margin of error that the engineer is willing to accommodate in the estimated value.

My topic is called:  Lattices and Basis Reduction  
A little backstory:  
I'm a senior in high school taking Computer Science. We have an assignment due tomorrow called Theoretical Computer Science. When choosing our topics there was a big rush for everybody to write down their names under each topic as only 3 people may do each topic. I stayed behind waiting for the crowd to dissipate. By the time I went to write my name, there were about six open topics, and the person in front of me was taking a long time to decide on a topic, so I went ahead and wrote my name under the topic that had no names. By the time I sat down, my teacher came up to me and said, ""Hey, it's super cool that you chose this topic. Nobody in my class has ever chosen it before."" so immediately, I thought, huh that's cool, and then he added, ""It's also the most difficult one on the list, good luck.""  
I just need somebody to please explain this topic to me, again its called Lattices and Basis Reduction. Keep in mind I'm only a senior in high school and I feel like this is a very difficult topic. I've done a lot of research on my own, but I end up staring blankly at a Wikipedia page or other articles with no clue what I'm looking at.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not asking for anybody to complete my assignment for me, I haven't posted any of the questions here for that reason, I'm just looking for somebody to please explain the topic to me, as I find it incredibly confusing. My tutor is unable to help me as he is confused as well, none of my friends are doing this topic, and people from previous years are also not doing this topic. My teacher is also refusing to assist me as it is an independent assignment.

I'm not completely clueless though. Building, fixing, and tinkering with computers is my favorite hobby.

First time posting here and don't know if this is allowed but I am a student in UK and will be applying to University. As some of you may know that doing so requires a personal statement. I will be applying for computer science degree. I am pasting my personal statement draft over here. Any feedback given will be appreciated and acknowledged.

""Growing up as a son of a senior SAP consultant, terms such as ""database migration"", ""server management"" and ""HANA"" were commonplace in our daily conversation, which was my launchpad for pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Getting a computer science degree will form the base of my knowledge aiding me to accomplish my ambition of being a technological entrepreneur and make revolutionary products.

Having no programming experience beforehand did not present itself as an obstacle for mastering the basics of Python in a month. To further heighten my skills in Python language, I decided to program a desktop-based personal assistant in the Christmas of 2018, which I believe where my curiosity in AI began. Google's Speech Recognition library and PTTSX3 engine served as the foundations of my program.  I learned many new skills: handling exceptions, implementing APIs and creating a GUI for a program, which will be helpful in my yearly projects in university. The ever-growing field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and their applications to modern-day problems were the main reason for the main focus of my computer science degree being around Artificial Intelligence by choosing modules such as ""Computer Vision"", ""Deep Learning"" and ""Natural Language Processing"". Learning such modules will enable me to embed these technologies and methods in my projects, therefore, making them more efficient.

My A-levels will be helping factors in my degree. Maths and Further Maths A-level equip me with skills in logic, problem-solving, analytical reasoning and research skills. Doing Further Pure as my optional unit in Further Maths amplified my mathematical intuition supporting me to perceive problems in new ways. As topics such as Calculus, Vectors and Proofs are part of the math modules in a computer degree, having an experience in solving such problems will make the transition into the degree more smooth. Physics A-level equips me with skills such as teamwork which I have gained by doing assessed practicals with classmates, giving me technical ability to perform practicals, benefiting me when doing yearly projects with groups or alone. Due to the passion physics, I sat BPHO and got a bronze medal giving me insights in competitive physics questions, evolving my scientific intuition. Computer Science A-level gives me a foundation knowledge of topics such as operating systems, system architecture, programming techniques, data exchange which form the base of the theory in Computer Science degree.

To learn more about Computer science, I started listening to TED and TEDx talks, aiding me to get awareness about recent advancements in the discipline of Computer Science. ""A beginner's guide to quantum computing by Shohini Ghose"" and ""A computer that works as a brain By Kwabena Boahen"" were my absolute favourites as they gave insight in the modern implementations of computer science in fields such as quantum computing, Medicine and AI. Inspired by this, I created a project for my further mathematics course titled, ""The mathematics behind neural networks"" in which I touched upon topics such as Backpropagation, Batch Gradient Descent, forward propagation and cost functions. I have also made programs for Simpson's Rule, Taylor Series, weather report, Numerical Methods for solving differential equations, to help me in my further maths course or daily life. Aside from academics, I relish creative writing which has motivated me to write my first draft of my fictional novel. I also plan to make my gaming computer to game with my friends. I also enjoy reading books like, ""God's Equation: Einstein, Relativity and the Expanding Universe"" and ""The Mystery of the Aleph"" being one of my picks. 

I believe I will use the knowledge that I have gained through my degree to go into the research sector in Silicon Valley, contributing to the sum knowledge of humankind by implementing AI in solving future problems, such as global warming and security.""

It has you solve puzzles of increasing complexity which culminate in constructing a simple CPU. You start at the level of nand gates, and build everything else up out of those.

I'm having trouble understanding the specifications for the Data Flip-Flop puzzle. If I'm reading it correctly, when the ""clock"" bit \_changes\_ from zero to one, the storage device should send its value to output, but while the ""clock"" bit \_remains\_ either one or zero, nothing should change the output value.

What I'm stuck on is this idea of having output change \_when and only when the clock changes from zero to one\_ I can't see a way to do that which doesn't allow the output to change any time the clock bit is equal to one. But that results in a failure when I submit such solutions.

Could I just be reading the specifications incorrectly somehow?

Here is a transcription of the specification:

&amp;#x200B;

 

A **DFF** (Data Flip-Flop) component stores and outputs a bit, but only change the output when the clock signal change from 0 to 1.

When **st** (store) is 1 and **cl** (clock signal) is 0 the value on **d** is stored. But the previous value is still emitted.

When the clock signal changes to 1, the flip-flop starts emitting the new value.

When **st** is 0, the value of **d** does not have any effect.

I already have Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach but that seems very high level. I was originally going to buy Hennessy and Patterson's Computer Organization and Design but some reviews are scaring me off from that. I am looking at Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi, but I am worried that it focuses too much on embedded systems. I want something more general and Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi's reviews sometimes make it seem like it covers Computer Architecture in the general sense.

So here's the criteria that I want:
1. The book should assume little knowledge of Computer Architecture
2. I learn best when I experiment so being a little interactive would be a plus
3. I want it to touch on some higher level topics like pipelining, branch predictions, machine code, cache, and possibly multicore processors

1. It'll be open-source on GitHub, but I'd like to get some credit if someone uses it in the future. A simple pointer to the original repository or ""original-author: X"" would be enough.
2. A license such as MIT seems to offer that. However, I wonder whether I'm actually a ""copyright holder"" by simply adding a LICENSE file to my repository.

You are a software engineer at a brand-new fintech startup that is looking to change the way people bank through innovative digital retail products. Similar to your startups competitors, the companys goal is to leverage state of the art technology and analytics to differentiate itself from incumbent players in the space.

The companys founder is fixated with behavioral science and was inspired by the way Uber encourages their drivers to keep driving1. It turns out that it is possible to sway an individuals behavior by nudging them towards a decision at exactly the right time with the right information. In the case of the bank, the flagship feature before launch is a smart checking account that will help customers better save for their retirement.

This is accomplished through an application that monitors the customers transactions and encourages them top up their purchase and invest the difference in their investment savings account at the time of a purchase.

An example scenario may be when customer A purchases a new laptop for $1350, he/she will receive a mobile notification during the time of purchase that reads: You will miss out on $4000 during retirement if you dont top-up your purchase to $1500. Would you like to deposit $150 to your Investments Savings Account?. If the customer replies Yes to the text, the payments system will take care of the rest. Note:  The suggested amount and retired projection are dependent on the financial profile of the customer. E.g. how much savings, income, and debt a customer has determines how much they can afford.  The type of transaction determines whether a customer will receive a notification. E.g. It would be annoying to get a mobile notification for small and frequent transactions such as The CTO has scanned the market and determined that there is currently no off-the shelf payments system that can support an analytics application like this and has decided that the payments system and the backend of the start-up will be built in house to support this use case.

You have been tasked to come up with an approach to the design a system that can support this flagship use case at launch.

The marketing team projects a sustained growth in customer sign-ups for the bank shortly and your aggressive investors cannot accept curbing customer sign-ups due to bad infrastructure.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

So I was working on a project and early on I accidentally detached from the Head, but I still kept commit etc. anyway. I then realized I was detached from the head, so I tried to do the following to reattach to the head:

git log -n 1 (I copied the commit)

git checkout master

git branch (long hash I copied)

git merge tmp (here I realize I forgot to name the branch so I typed again:

git branch tmp (long has I copied)

* i got a warning here about how the rename (long hash) is ambiguous, and Git normally never creates a ref that ends with 40 hex characters

git merge tmp here git said ""already up to date""

git branch -d tmp output: deleted branch tmp

after doing this, I was taken back to the state in which I was last attached to the head (wayyy back in my project).

Am I screwed? Or is there any way I can recover where I was at?

Currently have a home PC w/ OC 9900k 32gb DDR4 3200mhz, 2080ti. i mainly need something for while i deploy( AD air force) and take to school. I want to keep whatever mac i get for the next 3-5years. 

Considering a 13in MBP w/ 16gb ram and 256SSD. thats 1549.00, no tax (BHphoto). 

Or the 16in MBP w/ 16gb 512 SSD. 2,299.34 after tax. 

I am taking alot of my math requisites and want to get the IPAD pro as well, so i was thinking the 13in would be viable for a majority of work, and i could use the 11in as an additional screen when coding while im deployed iF needed.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyone with a 13in MBP that can elaborate on their experience using in Xcode, swift, etc? 

Is the screen size enough? is 13 in too small, or does it impede your work flow?

being the 16in just came out with a host of new upgrades, should i just plunge for the extra 800$ and get the 16in MBP, maybe itll last longer for me? 

Is the 4th gen butterfly keyboard reliable? i haven't found any evidence of it not after scouring the internet and reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Any input would be greatly appreciated. Im deploying soon and between everything else, this is adding alot of stress. On one hand, i do have the budget to buy the 16in, but 1000$ is a 1000$ and its nothing to scoff at.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

I've been interested in code analysis for some time now and for my next project I'm trying to understand how static analyzers work in detail. Moreover, I'm also trying to understand the common problem for static analyzers in regards to pointer analysis.

I'm working with **LLVM** and **Clang** as well as **KINT**. I want to create a call graph for the Linux kernel, while also trying to find an approach to include function pointers which are wrapped in individual [structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)). Even though pointer analysis is quite complex, I think it should be possible to at least extend the call graph so that indirect function calls via function pointers are recognized by the analyzer.

The idea would be to use the `struct` which contains the function pointer(s) and look for all occurrences where these structures are accessed and modified. That way, function pointers can be dereferenced by the analyzer to the actual function which is assigned to the function pointer. That (still undeveloped) approach would probably help to create a call graph for nearly most function pointers used in the Linux kernel, since they are usually stored in structures.

My question is: Is that possible in the first place? If so, how would one extend LLVM with a pass in order to recognize those function pointers?",3,1,False,self,,,,,

A good CS grad student (my gf) without a CS background got overwhelmed with her 1st prerequisite CS class ever (w/ full tuition remission for the entire Masters program). She is now looking to drop out after her 1st semester, even though shes not academically struggling. Pacing is intense in this accelerated course &amp; shes now getting 2nd thoughts about a career of being behind code all day. This semester is taking a toll on her. She stumbled upon UX/UI career through a tutor, &amp; thinks it may be a better fit for her with her psych background &amp; desire for creativity. She is considering paying $7000 for a Bootcamp program to become a UX/UI designer. 

Should I encourage her to stay in CS &amp; finish her masters degree, or should I encourage her to try out another tech field that will cost her money with no degree at the end? 

Im trying to be a good supportive partner for her, but I also dont want her to miss out on this huge opportunity of receiving a Master of CS w/o being under a +$100,000 of student debt.



#VERY LONG; WILL READ (but you dont have to):

My girlfriend was accepted into the Master of Computer Science program in early 2019. 

She has been a good CS grad student w/o a CS background (has a Bachelors in Psychology). She finishes her homework on time, studies every night (even through 40-hour workweek), active on Codecademy, &amp; regularly meets w/ on-campus tutors &amp; professor. 

I am quite proud of her, to say the least.

Fortunately, my gf has her tuition remission by taking a job as a full-time academic admin position for the college that accepted her ($28,350 tuition/year remission for the entire 2-4 year Master of CS program). 

Unfortunately, w/o prior CS knowledge, she got overwhelmed w/ her 1st CS class ever (CS 201, Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science). Every week she is getting crash coursed into new concepts, ideas, practices, &amp; coding (JAVA); And then she has to do assignments &amp; study for tests about things that she has never learned before. She is used to being a student with good grades, &amp; she is going through this immense academic struggle to just keep up a B/3.0 grade (Academic probation for her CS college makes it quite difficult as 3.0 GPA is the minimum grade that she needs to maintain.)

The fact that makes this decision harder:

In the summer of 2019, to allow my girlfriend to take on this new exciting Computer Science endeavor, we moved to a new town that has a train station to allow a tolerable commute for gfs new academic admin job. This move lengthened my commute time to my workplace, &amp; the rent for our new apartment costs an extra $600/month compared to our old apartment, so that adds financial stress. But moving to this town with a train station kept her from driving through the busy &amp; dangerous Chicago highway for hellish 3 total hours every day.

What personally hurts me as her partner is that we signed a 2-year lease to this new apartment, so I couldnt help but think that I may have wasted $10,000 on a new apartment with worse commute time personally for me.

She is now considering dropping out after her 1st semester even though shes not academically struggling, to pay $7000 for the Bootcamp program (i.e. [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/)) and hopefully become a UX/UI designer.

I am asking for those who are well experienced in either field. Do you have any insights that could help shed some light on this dilemma?

Thank you for your time.

#List (Pros/Cons)

**CS Masters degree**

Pros:

- Useful degree (arguably quite powerful, allows her to attain various jobs)
- She will learn valuable skills &amp; knowledge from the entire Master of CS program.
- Free. No tuition (specific perk/opportunity for her personally)
- High salary/benefits career potential
- Proven

Cons:

- Time-consuming 3.5 more years to go as a part-time grad student
- Overwhelming (I personally think its just from the accelerated course that she is taking)
- May not exactly put her in a position that she wants.

**Bootcamp UX/UI program**

Pros:

- Less time consuming - May avoid wasting 3.5 years in school &amp; streamline the career path that she now values (UX/UI)
- Allows her to practice creativity &amp; portfolio-based job hunt is attractive for her.
- Certificate after graduation
- Helps build portfolio

Cons:

- Roughly $7000* (* refund available if she does not find UX/UI career within 6 months* fine print)
- No degree upon completion of boot camp
- Unproven",3,1,False,self,,,,,

If not what's the average time complexity of my algorithm?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/e0v1b2/did_i_create_a_pseudopoly_time_algorithm_for/,Hope1995x,1574577569,"# Purpose of My algorithm in Python for intro into my pseudo-code

Firstly, I want to create a list called `possible_divisors` for our target variable. In this case, it should NEVER be a false NO answer or ""maybes"" as our output.

    possible_divisors = [i for i in s if target % i == 0]

My purpose is to use greedy multiplication in progression with a loop. This loop also creates a list called `prod_progression`. It consists of products from our `possible_divisors` list.

    prod_progression = [i for i in possible_divisors reduce(mul, s[0:i])]

I next discover the closest product `(for target)` in the list prod\_progression And, then iterate subset combinations and multiply them to see if they arrive to the `target`. This idea was to trim the list. So that the amount of subsets the solver iterates is reduced. This may increase the speed of the algorithm.

After this is done I create a new list called subsets. This list is intended to be the input array for the subset solver. Its the same index for the closest product in prod\_progression and  carries on from there. It uses the original input array.

    subsets = possible_divisors[0:j+len(prod_progression)+1]

In this case, if it were to fail, I can just resort to using `possible_divisors` for our input for the subset product solver.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, this is pseudo-polynomial solution for subset-product.

    subsets = possible_divisors[0:j+len(prod_progression)+1]

I like researching things deeper on my own but that when something attracts my attention enough to do so, even if it doesnt but I wanna learn something new. 

My situation here is that I began alright but then after falling behind that give up feeling really got into me and I feel awful most of the time and afraid of not making it through the first exams. I stopped attending lectures and stayed at home to go over my notes to catch up and did up to some point but Im tired of seeing a word or something that could be explained by someone way easier than me trying to google something every 2min. I was able to write 1-2 exercises out of 8 for my first assignment and Ill admit I used fiverr to get it done. Today I demonstrated it to a GLA and he asked me to explain how one of the codes worked and I had no idea what to tell him besides facts about what one or two things inside the whole code meant. He kept a note of weak explanation. I really want to understand and do my coursework on my own and also become able to catch up. My next assigment is due to the beginning of December. 

What I need is someone (paid for your time) to go through the notes with me and assure that I understand whats going on, try examples with etc. My first language is not english so understand that some familiar words to you may still be foreign to me. I see how coding makes logically sense but I hate the fact that I cannot get it alone. Also this thread explains my situation about my programming module. Let alone mathematics for computing, fundamentals of digital systems and databases. I didnt find time to go over those yet to see if I get them alone but right now I need assistance with python 3  programming.

A good CS grad student (my gf) without a CS background got overwhelmed with her 1st prerequisite CS class ever (w/ full tuition remission for the entire Masters program). She is now looking to drop out after her 1st semester, even though shes not academically struggling. Pacing is intense in this accelerated course &amp; shes now getting 2nd thoughts about a career of being behind code all day. This semester is taking a toll on her. She stumbled upon UX/UI career through a tutor, &amp; thinks it may be a better fit for her with her psych background &amp; desire for creativity. She is considering paying $7000 for a Bootcamp program to become a UX/UI designer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Should I encourage her to stay in CS &amp; finish her masters degree, or should I encourage her to try out another tech field that will cost her money with no degree at the end? 

&amp;nbsp;

Im trying to be a good supportive partner for her, but I also dont want her to miss out on this huge opportunity of receiving a Master of CS w/o being under a +$100,000 of student debt.

&amp;nbsp;

#VERY LONG; WILL READ (but you dont have to):

My girlfriend was accepted into the Master of Computer Science program in early 2019. 

&amp;nbsp;

She has been a good CS grad student w/o a CS background (has a Bachelors in Psychology). She finishes her homework on time, studies every night (even through 40-hour workweek), active on Codecademy, &amp; regularly meets w/ on-campus tutors &amp; professor. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am quite proud of her, to say the least.

&amp;nbsp;

Fortunately, my gf has her tuition remission by taking a job as a full-time academic admin position for the college that accepted her ($28,350 tuition/year remission for the entire 2-4 year Master of CS program). 

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, w/o prior CS knowledge, she got overwhelmed w/ her 1st CS class ever ([CS 201](https://science.iit.edu/courses/cs201), Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science). Every week she is getting crash coursed into new concepts, ideas, practices, &amp; coding (JAVA); And then she has to do assignments &amp; study for tests about things that she has never learned before. She is used to being a student w/ good grades, &amp; she is struggling to keep up a B/3.0 grade (Academic probation for her CS college makes it quite difficult as 3.0 GPA is the minimum grade that she needs to maintain.) She is getting A's on assignments, but tests are difficult. I do not doubt her willingness to work hard through either CS or UX/UI.

&amp;nbsp;

The fact that makes this decision harder:

In the summer of 2019, to allow my girlfriend to take on this new exciting Computer Science endeavor, we moved to a new town that has a train station to allow a tolerable commute for gfs new academic admin job. This move lengthened my commute time to my workplace, &amp; the rent for our new apartment costs an extra $600/month compared to our old apartment, so that adds financial stress. But moving to this town with a train station kept her from driving through the busy &amp; dangerous Chicago highway for hellish 3 total hours every day.

&amp;nbsp;

What personally hurts me as her partner is that we signed a 2-year lease to this new apartment, so I couldnt help but think that I may have wasted $10,000 on a new apartment with worse commute time personally for me.

&amp;nbsp;

She is now considering dropping out after her 1st semester even though shes not academically struggling, to pay $7000 for the Bootcamp program (i.e. [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/)) and hopefully become a UX/UI designer.

&amp;nbsp;

I am asking for those who are well experienced in either field. Do you have any insights that could help shed some light on this dilemma?

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for your time.

#List (Pros/Cons)

**CS Masters degree**

Pros:

- Useful degree (arguably quite powerful, allows her to attain various jobs)
- She will learn valuable skills &amp; knowledge from the entire Master of CS program.
- Free. No tuition (specific perk/opportunity for her personally)
- High salary/benefits career potential
- Proven

Cons:

- Time-consuming 3.5 more years to go as a part-time grad student
- Overwhelming (I think its just from the accelerated course that she is taking)
- May not exactly put her in a position that she wants.

**Bootcamp UX/UI program**

Pros:

- Less time consuming - May avoid wasting 3.5 years in school &amp; streamline the career path that she now values (UX/UI)
- Allows her to practice creativity &amp; portfolio-based job hunt is attractive for her.
- Certificate after graduation
- Helps build portfolio

Cons:

- Roughly $7000* (* refund available if she does not find UX/UI career within 6 months* fine print)
- No degree upon completion of boot camp
- Unproven

I'm not sure I will be able to explain what it is I am trying to do but I will give it my best shot. I am going to use simplified code to explain everything. It is not my actual program as the program is much more complicated and I wouldn't be able to explain over text. Here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a method in my program that does something along the lines of  

`print eval(env)`

Where eval is a method I've implemented to evaluate a Boolean expression and env is a dictionary.

`env = {""x"" : False, ""y"" : True}`

However, I have to run tests on the code and there are print statements like the ones below. The print statement uses a different dictionary each time.

`print (eval({""x"" : True}))`

`print (eval({""x"" : True, ""y"" : True}))`

`print (eval({""x"" : False, ""y"" : True}))`

So how can I make it so the original print statement isn't stuck with the original env dictionary and instead uses the dictionary in the print statement. i.e instead of `print eval(env)` It prints `print eval(what ever is in the test print dictionary)`

&amp;#x200B;

Hope I explained it well enough

I got this issue with my USB it is not read anymore by my ford music player, it used to be readable, but I needed to install windows on laptop thus I used it for that purpose , also I removed and partitions from it several times and created new ones using ""AOMEI Partition Assistant Professional Edition 8.4"" and windows disk management... I did it several times and do not remember order in which it happened, I used Windows ""MediaCreationTool1909"" windows 10 and ""Windows 7 USB DVD Download Tool"", I also used ""rufus-3.8"" at some point... its all so bizarre I know...

So the problem now although the USB sticks seems to be functional and completely readable by PC and Samsung TV without any error messages, it is not readable by ""AOMEI Partition Assistant Professional Edition 8.4""  which is not at all a problem to me, but most importantly it is not read by my ""Ford Mondeo 2012"" USB port.

 I think these two cases are related because I've tried to read my brother's nearly identical USB stick on both the car and ""AOMEI"" and it works flawlessly.

I do realize it is easier to buy new USB and less time and money consuming, but the curiosity is killing me, I mean why is this happening? **Are USB sticks have other mean of identification and readability that can not be reset by just formatting them or deleting partitions to create new ones?**

But Ive also seen that theres an i3-2375M which seems to have same packageing and same clock but obviously with vastly different performances.

Python is one of the most used languages. Whether for web development, machine learning, and [artificial intelligence](https://www.codeavail.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Homework-Help) or even the programming of micro controls  Python has found its place everywhere.

There are many other programming languages. You may even have learned some of them. So why Python, why is it so special? There are several reasons to learn Python, the largest of which is listed below.

#### Easy to learn

Python is considered one of the most user-friendly languages for beginners. The syntax of Python is the simplest of them all. You do not have to learn the types of complex variables, use parentheses to group code blocks, etc. Python is based on the basic principle of ease of use for beginners.  


#### Great Demand

According to a recent survey by Job Search and Act, Python developers are among the most paid developers in the United States. The huge potential of Python jobs can be estimated from the fact that the average rate programmers fell 6% in 2014, but Python developers still have risen to 8.9%.  


#### Ideal for web development

Python is extremely fast compared to other web development languages like PHP and ASP.NET.

In addition, Python has a variety of amazing frameworks like Django, Bottle, and Pylon, which further simplifies web development. Sites like Instagram, Pinterest, and The Guardian are all based on the famous Django framework.  


#### Strongly used for machine learning and AI

Python is the most widely used language for machine learning and artificial intelligence operations. Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn greatly simplify artificial intelligence tasks compared to [MATLAB](https://www.codeavail.com/MATLAB-Assignment-Help) or R, which used to be the most common environment for data science and artificial intelligence tasks.  


#### Works with Raspberry Pi

Python is the most popular programming language of the Raspberry Pi, a portable microcomputer that is used in a variety of applications such as robots, game consoles, and toys. In short, if you want to build something with the Raspberry Pi, learn Python.

Well, the Python programming language is the hottest language in 2019. As a beginner learning a programming language, you should choose Python as it is very popular and easy to learn.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

So far I have made one friend and met a handful of people in my program. This is mainly due to my lack of interest in socialising at the start of the degree, and also due to the nature of my particular programme (few to no social activities, compared to the rest at this university), small class size (more than half dropped out by now I believe) and lack of suitable people.

None of the people I've met so far have actually had the same interests as me, they are young gamers who decided to study CS. They don't like coding (most of them said they hate coding), don't work on projects in their free time, don't code obviously, don't care about FOSS (I tried to explain, but they didn't get the point, see what I mean?), and so on. I understand that everyone studies their subject for different reasons, and I am sure these people are doing it to get a decent career and will get good jobs eventually, and that's OK.

I have seen some ""unix-beards"" at university (mostly computer \*engineers\*, not computer scientists, since that is a more prestigious degree here, and has a class size 3-4 times larger than mine), and wish I could have ended up with them somehow, but I didn't and I didn't try. Obviously at this point it's a bit late. By unix-beards I mean long-haired nerdy-looking thinkpad users with penguin accoutrements, you probably know the kind of person.

I feel like I am being held back. I have no friends ""IRL"", only online (some of which are the ""nerdy"" programmer type) and this is a problem since when I am with other people I get a lot of energy, inspiration, I feel happier, want to do many things. In school there were some other coders and we'd inspire each other, someone would see me doing something, they'd get interested and do it too, and vice versa. I really miss this and I feel like I am learning less because of this lack of interested friends. When talking to my online friends I do get some of this effect, they'll mention something I don't know and this will make me interested, and just more interested in everything in general. Actually meeting any friends does improve my mood and interest in my subject. I was/ am somewhat depressed (SSRIs etc), maybe that has something to do with it.

I would like to be a ""real scientist"", do an msc and maybe a phd, but I feel like I'm so far away from the rest of those people, e.g. TAs, professors, etc at my university. I'm too shy to talk to them, mainly because my knowledge is really lacking, and I'm finding it hard to learn anything because I am so unmotivated or even disinterested. INB4 ""why did you study CS"" I'll have you know I've coded for about 15 years, contribute to open source projects, participate in various competitions and summer internships/ GSOC, but reading research papers? Don't feel like it usually, nor do I have anyone with whom to discuss these things.

Edit: I am also being started on ADD medicine soon, I hope it'll help with studying.

TLDR: no friends, worried I will fail and end up not learning anything or be good enough to get an interesting job, want intelligent friends, no drive/ motivation for the science part of computer science, what do? Does anyone want to be my friend?",0,1,False,self,,,,,
