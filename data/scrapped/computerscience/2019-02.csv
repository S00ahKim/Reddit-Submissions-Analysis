So a little bit of backstory - I pretty much grew up coding because I was a really shy and nerdy kid who played a lot of computer games during my time at school. Learned to code by modding games. When it came time to decide what to do at university I never even really gave it much thought, and just went into computer science because it's what I had been doing for years.  


After highschool though my personality switched up a lot as I made new friends outside school and came out of my comfort zone socially. I developed a lot of new interests like fitness and music and art and became a lot more extroverted. I now feel like I have some resentment for computers and programming because I believe that was a big part of what made me socially retarded. I find spending too much time around computers can make me feel sad and like I'm wasting time.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the deal now: 

&amp;#x200B;

I have completed my first year of computer science with no real issues but I just had that feeling in the back of my mind that I wasn't sure if I could be happy working as a programmer for the rest of my life. Now I'm deciding whether I should just stick out my last 2 years and get my degree, or change to something that might interest me more (not entirely sure what that would look like). I am considering Physiotherapy, which would take me 4 years (graduating at 24 - is that too late?)  


So basically what I'm asking to those who work in computer science is - do you ever feel depressed spending so much time around computers? Is the work rewarding, and do you feel fulfilled doing it? What kind of career avenues are available outside of just programming? Do you have to LOVE coding to do it?  


Don't get me wrong I can enjoy the feeling of completing a project and having something that works well. I like problem solving and all that but I don't think I could confidently say that I LOVE coding. The idea of sitting behind a desk forever scares me a bit, but I don't know if I'm overthinking it.  


Sorry for the long post; if anyone has ever felt like this or been in my position, or just has something to say on the matter please drop a comment I'd love to hear what you have to say, if nothing else just to put my mind to ease. Thanks &lt;3",3,1,False,self,,,,,

I am a student in Canada and my goal is to work in either software engineering or go into data science.

I got accepted to a university that is ranked around ~200 in the world and is known for being a somewhat prestigious for all of its programs. It is very reputable in Canada particularly. However I got accepted to Math and Stats there and did not apply to CS as many people have told me that they have a very strong Math/Stats program. It is too late to change my major.

On the other hand, I got accepted to another school ranked ~500-600 and I applied for computer science there. It is a decent school but probably not as reputable as the top 200 school, but I will be studying CS there. It has an okay reputation.

tl;dr - should I study math/stats at a top 200 school or computer science at a top 500-600 school? My goal is mainly getting into data science or software engineering.

So excited me finally decided to finish my B.S in Computer Science. So I am going to an ON-line school. I rather not mention the name of the school, but it is regionally accredited by the higher education learning commission and a couple other groups. It is not 'known' as a diploma mill, as far as I know. I believed it to be a pretty 'decent' on-line school seeing that the majority of them do have diluted programs of study. 

 So I am trying to wrap my head around how BASIC this Introduction to Computer Science class is!!!!! The curriculum is a freaking JOKE! THe class is almost like a ""introduction to HoWTO learn computers"".. it's written as if the student has never had much of any experience working with a computer. There has been absolutely NO writing code. No learning of any thing of substance in relation to computer science. More of less it's been almost as INTRO level as one can get and not even in the sense of computer science, but more like, introduction to howto use a computer for the first time.. Here an an example. Here is my requirement for my Midterm paper: 

For your midterm project complete the following using screenshots, images or diagram of sample products, processes, etc. to illustrate and descriptive texts to address the items below (you may also consult YouTube.com as a source) This is not a research paper; however provide your source(s):  


1. Identify at least 3 types of computers, how they process information, and the purpose and function of key hardware components.  
2. Explain how software and hardware work together to perform computing tasks and how software is developed and upgraded.  
3. Identify at least three different types of application software and general description relating to application software categories.  
4. Using an operating system, identify what an operating system is and how it works, and solve common problems related to operating systems.  
5. Illustrate the process of using an operating system to manipulate a computers desktop, files and disks.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone else please help me out here. Does this sound like any kind of Introduction to Computer science on a college level?????? It is almost as if I feel a little bit offended. I am actually taking this major because I WANT to LEARN. This material is so WATERED down its SAD. And the fact I am paying MONEY for this garbage is sickening.  I really pray the rest of the curriculum is not as watered down. My concentration is in Software Dev.. so this really is a sad intro for anyone going into the path of Dev.. as I am not trying to learn HOWTO turn my computer on, or what an OPERATINg system is... THIS IS CRAZY... Who do I talk to about this???? This is a JOKE or am I looking to hard to something that I know its not.. I understand i am not enrolled at MIT or Harvard....

Unfortunately, my program offers very very little options to learn programming.  I took one C++ course freshman year in undergrad, and they just opened a Python class that I am taking this semester.  I have never felt like a natural coder, but I found both classes interesting, challenging, and fun, 3 words that I could never even begin to use to describe the work I'm doing right now.

So I should be good at what I'm doing, I just hate it so much that I make very little progress.

I always berate myself for not switching to CS in undergrad, and I'm constantly hating myself for not switching sooner.  The past few weeks my mind has been stuck on the thought that there is no ""sooner"" than right now.  I'm just about to get my masters-in-passing for the EE degree, so if there was any last time to jump off the PhD train and choose a different path, it's now. 

I come to this subreddit to see if anyone has similar stories?  Do you think it's possible to switch over right now, and are there any schools that offer a CS master's program for people coming from non-CS backgrounds.  I've realized in 2 years from now, I can either be graduating with a masters in CS and looking for jobs, or I can be failing my EE PhD comprehensive exam and looking at 2-3 more years in school (losing my fellowship at that point too cause it runs out).  Let me know what you guys think and if anyone has made a similar jump.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

(X-Post),https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/an21a4/what_happens_if_nodes_are_partitioned_between/,chlekkr,1549289622,"This is in a distributed system context. I posted this in r/DistributedComputing a couple of days but got no answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say we have a front-end gateway layer with replicated gateways. L is the gateway leader, F1 and F2 are gateway followers. All gateways have a copy of the directory that maps the partitioning of the data to the back-end servers.

All client requests are routed to gateways randomly for load-balancing (let's say via DNS), and each gateway redirects the client request to the appropriate server based on the directory.

H1 and H2 are consecutive heartbeats between L and F1. The timeline is as follows:

\- t = 0: H1 succeeds

\- t = 1: we have a network failure where F1 and L can't communicate anymore

\- t = 2: L changes the partitioning of the data on the servers and sends a copy of the new partitioning to its followers. F1 can't receive this updated partitioning.

\- t = 3: F1 receives a client request, and routes it to the wrong server because it still has the old partitioning

\- t = 4: H2 fails because of the network failure



My questions are the following: 1- what happens at t = 3, what are the consequences on the system? How do distributed systems cope with this problem. 2 - what happens after t = 4? F1 doesn't receive a heartbeat from the leader, so it starts a new election but loses it because it can't talk to other gateways so it takes itself out?

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Systems usually use an epoch (or term) number attached to each request to make sure it is associated with an up to date state. However, even using  a term number wouldn't solve this issue, as the entire cluster could have been partitioned by the network, and some server nodes wouldn't know about the latest term number.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Some things like word docs and spreadsheets that I will input incriminating evidence on, e.g. letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow, should theoretically show the date and time I set the system to, correct?

Also any ideas and other ways I can bring this scenario to life in a virtual environment where I pretend to be all actors involved would be greatly appreciated.

could somebody help me with some computer science exercise?

I have 2 similar exercise, could somebody check if my way of thinking is okay?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Lets consider two regular language L\_1 = {} and L\_2 = . Then: 

&amp;#x200B;

 A) L\_1  L\_2 = 

 B) L\_1\^(\*) = L\_2\^(\*)

 C) L\_1\^(\*)  L\_2\^(\*)

 D) L\_2\^(\*)  L\_1\^(\*)

 E) L\_1\^(\*)  L\_2\^(\*) = (L\_1  L\_2)\^(\*)

 F) L\_1L\_2 = L\_2L\_1

 G) L\_1  L\_1L\_2

 H) L\_2  L\_1L\_2

&amp;#x200B;

A - definition says that intersection of A and B are words that are both in A and B set, so we don't have any common parts so intersection of this two sets is nohing - empty set, so answer A is okay. 

B - complement of L\_1 is  (\^(\*) = ) and \^(\*) = , so L\_1\^(\*) = L\_2\^(\*), B is also okay

C - if B is true then C can't be true 

D - same as C 

E - L\_1\^(\*)  L\_2\^(\*) =  and (L\_1  L\_2) =  and \^(\*) = , so E is ok

F -  =  = , its ok

G -  is not subset of , so its okay

H -  is subset of L\_1L\_2 

&amp;#x200B;

 **My final answer: A,B,E,F,G**

&amp;#x200B;

And second exercise, very similar: 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Lets consider two regular language L\_1 = (aa)\^(\*) and L\_2 = a(aa)\^(\*). Then: 

&amp;#x200B;

 A) L\_1  L\_2 = 

 B) L\_1\^(\*) = L\_2\^(\*) 

 C) L\_1\^(\*)  L\_2\^(\*)

 D) L\_2\^(\*)  L\_1\^(\*)

 E) L\_1\^(\*)  L\_2\^(\*) = (L\_1  L\_2)\^(\*) 

 F) L\_1L\_2 = L\_2L\_1

 G) L\_1  L\_1L\_2 

 H) L\_2  L\_1L\_2

&amp;#x200B;

A - L\_1 contains all strings of even number of a, L\_2 contains all string of odd number of a, so intersection of L\_1 and L\_2 is empty set, A is ok 

B - complement of L\_1 is all strings of odd number of a, complement of L\_2 is now all strings of even number of a, so they are not equal

C - L\_1\^(\*) cannot be subset of L\_2\^(\*) because they dont have any common part, so its ok

D - the same as C, so its also ok 

E - summ of odd and even number of a is equal to all numbers of a (including 0), complement of summ odd and even number is empty set? So its false?

F - its okay, because its just a string of a, no matter which part (L\_1 or L\_2) goes first 

G - even number + odd number of a its still odd number of a, so L\_1 cant be subset of L\_2 so its ok

H - as G + L\_1 can be  and then L\_2 is also subset of L\_1L\_2

&amp;#x200B;

 **My answer: A, C, D, F, G**

Is thier any courses which are highly credited to do with subjects siniliar to computer science whereby you don't need to be a computer ACE to get.


I have a huge Intrest and wanting to become a Software Developer but I've looked at bachelors degree's and there very strict on who is allowed to join and demand very high grades to get In.

Moreover I do not think I meet the requitements during my time at college and school I was very lazy and unmotivated. I did believe half the subjects weren't properly explained either we did things or had to write assignments and certain things felt as though weren't mentioned.


But I feel as If I really stuck In and paid for something myself I'd be alot more motivated to try harder.


Hence wise I do believe I can do atleast a credited course.


I have done two level 3 courses at college. I am British In the UK by the way.

I was lazy do for instance I got a Merit one year and a Merit pass the other. And I think I got a pass the next year. I will admit my last year I couldn't of cared less. awful I know. 

My first two years were with Public Services I found out what coding was after I finished the course and couldn't join the army.


I then found out all about coding and what not.


I like the Idea ever since.

So the ones I've got that are worth noting Is a Merit and Merit/Pass. And I have 4 GCSE, C grades.


I don't think I'll be aloud to do a Bachelors degree bit I could do or find a credit course similiar that definitely help In the field.


Has anyone got any advice or can point a direction to a course similar to computer science that would look good on a CV/Resume?


Plan of action 

My method of going about this dream Job Is soon as I've passed my driving tests and papers and that get as many credited online courses (trusted and ones that look good credited ones) and do as many as I can and also help poeple put on projects (build a portfolio). I've noticed that poeple on reddit are always asking fir help to build or create things so why not do that?


So for the next few years online courses and building my portfolio are my methods of preparation for my dream job.

I am working on a RAM machine. If I have an ordered list of sorted integers (and the size of the list) and I want to find a particular integer's position in the list, it is just a matter of doing a binary search. This procedure is obviously O(log n). Now, suppose I have an ordered list of *unsorted* integers and I want to find a particular integer's position in the list. This is clearly O(n) since the expected search time is n/2 for a list of size n.

Now suppose I have an NTM M, and I wish to find an integer's position in the same list. I search in the following way: 

State (a) compare the first integer in the current sub-list and the integer half-way through the sub-list with the target integer M; if either matches, return that index, otherwise, divide the list into two sub-lists (excluding the integers already searched) and invoke state (a) on each sub-list, respectively.

This is my attempt at a (probably buggy) description of basically doing a ""breadth-wise binary search"", taking advantage of non-determinism to search exponentially many integers at once.

Since we cannot have a deterministic TM that can solve this problem in time less than O(n) and since we have an NTM that can solve this same problem in time O(log n), doesn't this prove that L =/= NL? As I understand, the equality of L and NL is an open question and this is a very obvious path to prove separation of the classes, so I must be missing something.

I am a Computer Science student currently taking a Computer Architecture course. We are almost a full month into the course and so far I am almost completely lost. We have started off the semester covering digital circuits, such as computational circuits, latches, and flip-flops.

The reason this class has proved very difficult is due to my professors teaching style. At the beginning of the year we were assigned a textbook, but told by our professor to not purchase it as we would not understand it. Right away, I knew this was going to be bad.

Despite telling us to not bother with the textbook, he uploads scans of chapters as our ONLY supplied resource for referencing to. When teaching, the professor only reads these exact scans and does not show any kind of sample problems or exercises.

I have tried many resources online such as Udemy and YouTube to find some material that might help explain what I am suppose to be doing, but have really had no luck. I did find a cool YouTube playlist by NESO Academy, but there is little for practice examples.

Basically, I am looking for any resources and advice that might help me push through this course. I really want to learn the material, and in all honesty I think it is interesting. At the moment, I am just lost and frustrated, as is my entire class.

I will post links below with sample assignments I have been assigned to work on. So far, I really have no idea where to start. Again, any advice is truly appreciated.

After four challenging years, I have graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science! Hooray! There's only one small problem - I absolutely detest programming.

\[Background\]

 I was a very young high school graduate (16) and was sort of forced into the program by my two very well-meaning parents. I continued the program because I'm good at school and as a bonus I was able to go through school with my now husband. To be clear, I am a decent programmer and I have just under three years of experience in a development role, so this distaste isn't for lack of trying. The programming jobs that I had gave me anxiety that began to effect my life in an unfortunate way. 

I'm here because I want to know my options. I am reasonably smart, I am great with people, and I learn quickly - I just don't want my job to make me sick.

I feel like I've wasted four years of my life and so here I am. Specifically, what kinds of careers can I have with a Computer Science degree that do not involve programming? 

I'm all ears.

I'm currently in Political Science and Economics. I chose the major because I was considering law school. But I've become less interested in that recently. I decided that since I Econ and Finance students have similar first year courses, I would use my electives to take some finance courses and switch to Finance on March 1st (when applications open). However, I've been doubting myself a lot and don't think the finance culture is for me. And neither is the excel, stats, business this and that lingo for me. 

I've been thinking of switching into computer science instead. I think the work culture works better for me. I've always had a fear of tech because I'm a woman (even if I know it's not as big a deal anymore). I've always loved math and i took a computer programming course in Highschool and learned a bit of python. I'm just scared I'll hate it and regret my decision. Because I don't want to set myself behind because I'm an international student and university is super expensive for me. 

I honestly don't know how to make a decision between finance and computer science. 

How did you guys pick? Do you guys like the major? Any regrets? I'm also a shy person if that gives any extra info about myself (networking is important in Finance which scares me)

If you need some background:

- I l o v e Java, or OOP in general, but Java is my main. I do know Python but Im rusty since I started and practiced with Java last semester. (Im a sophomore now, btw. I learned Python during my first semester of freshman year.)

-Ive had experience in web development in high school, and I got an A in both of the courses that were available.

(I know HTML isnt really a programming language, but back then I thought it was. I am, though, interested in JavaScript, which *is* considered a programming language.)

So Im currently a computer science student in the U.S. I recently switched this semester and Im loving it. Im taking Python, Java, a technical writing class, calculus 1, and a class about how tech has affected society. Taking two languages at once is killing me though. I wont have to do that again with the rest of my classes as I can spread out languages, there was just no other way to go full time without taking two languages. 



I was a pre-med nursing major, then pre-med bio, then back to regular nursing and now computer science. I wanted to be a surgeon but not go to school for another decade... so I dropped to nurse and decided I honestly didnt care enough for people to be a good nurse. Ive always been interested in computers and with a little push from some friends and the head of the CS dept, I switched. 



Anyway, so I have all my gen-eds done. I just basically have a couple math classes and then all CS core classes left. Ive shoved everything into two years with the new banded tuition rates so I can at least get a few free credits every semester. 



The problem is, I wont have time to do any internships before I graduate. I also am looking into doing a business and/or math minor. I am very interested in starting my own business myself or with a friend. My friend doesnt have a business major or anything of the like and hes graduated already so I would have to do that...



I also kinda wanna take a chill pill with classes. Im always studying and its really stressful. I just wanna take a few classes a semester and do well in those and really master the concepts but I also want to get out of college and start building my life and making money. Ive found the person I want and I dont want to be forced to wait when it comes to things of a romantic sense because of schooling. Im really trying to be patient but Ive already been in school for two years and now its another two guaranteed and I just am tired of it. 



Long story short, I dont know what to do. My future depends on what I do with schooling. I could really use advice from those who didnt do internships, those who have a math or business degree, those who took a little longer in college, and those who sped it up.

Changing the long int to a different number did not help either with the problem, rather it instead stored less numbers.

Computers and technology relate to Information technology. It contains a list of developments regarding computers.  Technology which has been developing day by day like programming and software, communication, hardware, networking, database design etc. 

Computer technology mainly focuses on software and hardware development. The famous IT companies in the world getting focus on software development. Because of the increasing number of work reasons and they need software to work. At this time IT companies designing new software systems to work on.

**Types of computers:**

**1.Mainframe**  **computers:**

Mainframe computers are used by huge organizations for important, difficult and critical applications and large data processing. These types of computers are mainly used by the government and large-scale industries and for business purpose also. These mainframe computers are secured in climate-controlled rooms and these [computers](https://jacobspublishers.com/jacobs-journal-of-computer-science/) perform multiple operating systems. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Mainframe computers](https://i.redd.it/dicl1sqbrvf21.jpg)

**2. Supercomputers:**

Supercomputers are very highly computation and handled intensive calculations. Supercomputers can do multiples of calculations in seconds. Among all the computers, they have the best memory sufficiency. Supercomputers are used in some organizations like space research, physics, weather forecasts where huge calculations placed.

&amp;#x200B;

[Supercomputer](https://i.redd.it/ugybn6vcrvf21.jpg)

**3. Minicomputers:**

Minicomputers are very popular in society since the 1970s. The small, medium business industries can also use minicomputers. They are called third generation computers and they are also used in small business offices and schools to store a small amount of data.

&amp;#x200B;

[Minicomputer](https://i.redd.it/v9qbgprdrvf21.jpg)

**4. Personal computers:**

The changes in technology became personal and companies like Apple, IBM were made entries. Till then computers became personal and people are using personal computers like laptops, desktops, tablets etc for their personal works. These are also used in schools and for the learning process.

&amp;#x200B;

[Personal computer](https://i.redd.it/emcc8bzervf21.jpg)

**5. Professional workstations:**

These types of computers are used less because of the popularity of personal computers. These are having less cost and high power consumption. They are still used by schools, offices and personal works.

**Importance of Computers and Technology:**

Computers and technology have been playing an important role in society.

1. It is first important to education because in these days the things are doing are mostly depending on computers. 

2. Business is also depending on computers and technology. Because it needs the fastest network and accuracy to work and get communicated with other companies.

3. It is important to our economy that can calculate the growth and loss of the country.

4. Present exams are also conducting on the bases of computers. It is called an online examination.

5. Computer technology is useful to connect people and increase communication among people.

6. Computer technology performs multiple applications at a time so business can run multiple applications at a time.

7. Computer technology is using for many industries like banks, education, business, industries and in small-scale industries also.

**Advantages of computers and technology:**

1. Many people are using Google maps instead of paper version maps to locate their position and direct them from one place to another.

2. Robots are using in key-hole surgery on patients in the medical field. This means the person would get less percent open for infection. Because of this patient would get the quicker recovery that patient is staying less time in the hospital.

3. Computer technology keeps our family in contact and connects our old friends and we can also make new friends by using social media networks like Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype and many more. People are using computers to get knowledge from youtube and general knowledge apps.

4. People are learning about health, business, education, and programs by using computer technology.

5. Nowadays people are also buying products online. It is also called online marketing. Like groceries, healthy products, books, shopping all these are done by computer technology.

**Disadvantages of computers and technology:**

1. Computer technology is having a massive problem in public and private society by using too many social media networks like Facebook, Instagram. With these types of social media sites, people are wasting their time by using out of their time and it could be dangerous for tracking details of their own.

2. It has a huge impact on the school children that they are wasting their time playing games. It could impact their education and results.

3. In large scale industries robots are used to fix products in less time by computer technology. This could be led to the unemployment of common people. Robots are using because they can assemble products in less time and faster than humans.

4. In the hospital or medical field if the computers would break down the entire document will be deleted and lost. This can impact the hospital and the people who the people are having the documentation in that particular computer systems. 

5. Many people are not using computer technology in a positive way. This type of using technology can impact society in a large amount.

**Conclusion:**

In a way, we can say that computers and technology is a boon for our society if we use it in a proper way. If we are using technology in a positive way we can get such a nice result like developing and employment of poor people and etc. It can be a curse if we use this technology in a negative way. Then we will get a huge impact.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

(Tl; Dr at the bottom)

Obviously, cyber security involves knowing about security.  The only problem with this is that the concept of security is the amount of theatrics.  People with a security mindset see the world differently.  They cant walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift (Schneier, The Security Mindset).  They have to think like an attacker, or an adversary.  Using this mindset, security engineers can build a support system, which basically means that if an attacker takes down one system, there would be other systems to go through.  Sounds simple right?
    Wrong.
    The security theater provides stories for the people to feed off of.  Take terrorism for example.  Terrorist attacks are few and far in between, and yet, people fear those over actual risks like road accidents (Parker-Pope).  The culprit for this is your brain.  As Parker-Pope stated in Wrong About Risk? Blame Your Brain, fear is a great way to remember something, so people are more inclined to remember plane crashes and terrorists over car crashes, resulting in roughly 1000 additional vehicular deaths because people believed it would be safer to drive to their long distance locations rather than fly (Parker-Pope).  It also doesnt help that people view security like some sort of movie plot: we may know an attack is coming, but unless the attacker specifically says how, when, and where they are attacking, we cant prepare for it as people seem to think we can by evacuating people or sending in law enforcement.  Bruce Schneier said movie plot security only works if we guess right, but since we cannot guess accurately, the best thing we can do is prepare a defense against all threats, no matter how important or unimportant the people perceive them to be (Schneier, Terrorists Dont Do Movie Plots).  That brings us around to the third and final problem.
    There is an imbalance between attackers and defenders.  The defender has to defend against all attacks while the attacker just needs to exploit one vulnerability to achieve their goal, resulting in an asymmetric relationship that favors the attacker.
    In conclusion, there is no such thing as a perfect security.  People perceive larger, flashier threats as more important than actual threats, leaving the us open to all sorts of attacks.  As Schneier says in regard to the theatrics in security, stories are what we fear (Schneier,Beyond Security Theater).  We will not be able to defend ourselves properly if the people continue to hold onto this mindset.

As the title states, I am wondering about binary trees. I was reading the Wiki page about them and it stated that a binary  tree of the empty set is part of an ""extended binary tree"". I am having trouble figuring out what it means by the empty set being a ""different type of node"". I get that it is empty, but would it still be considered a node in itself? Would an ordering algorithm yield the node with the empty set as one of its outputs?  


Also, one more question about binary trees. Reading up on them, it would appear that there is a distinction between the root and leaves of a tree, and I was wondering, would a single node tree (i.e. just the root) also be considered a tree with no leaves or would the root be considered a leaf since it has no children?

Unfortunately, because it is on the JVM I cannot simply do a raw jump instruction to the tail function. After playing around with the subject on my own for a while I thought I should ask around for the best way to emulate such a feature.

It seems to me there are three main options:

* Optimising whole program analysis which is beyond my expertise (and requires a closed world anyway.)
* Something like the Chicken Scheme strategy which is bad for optimisation because the JVM cannot optimise functions well while they are still being used.
* Trampolining via function pointers which is bad for optimisation because it prohibits inlining.
* Avoid tail calls entirely and rely mostly on higher order functions.

I would avoid tail calls entirely but I want to implement things like continuations and coroutines on top of them. Currently I am going with trampolining and two arrays for returning values without boxing but I feel this is suboptimal and I have missed some other possibilities.

Is there any literature in particular I should review?

# How I compile stuff currently

As an example, consider summing over an array and pretend Java has tail-call 'optimisation' semantics (there really has to be a better phrase for this.)

    float sum(float[] array) {
            return sumHelper(array, 0, 0.0f);
    }
    
    float sumHelper(float[] array, int ii, float accum) {
            if (ii &gt; array.length) {
                    return accum;
            }
            accum += array[ii];
            ++ii;
            return sumHelper(array, ii, accum);
    }

My current plan is to compile to something like the following (possible duplication of the generic looping code is intentional):

    class Sums {
            static float sum(float[] array, byte[] valueReturn, Object[] objectReturn) {
                    return sumHelper(array, 0, 0.0, valueReturn, objectReturn);
            }
    
            static float sumHelper(float[] array, int ii, float accum, byte[] valueReturn, Object[] objectReturn) {
                    var label = sumHelper$body(array, ii, accum, valueReturn, objectReturn);
                    if (label != null) {
                            sumHelper$loop(label);
                    }
                    return (float) AS_FLOATS.get(valueReturn, 0);
            }
    
            private static void sumHelper$loop(Label label) {
                    do {
                            label = sumHelper$loopSome(label);
                    } while (label != null);
            }
    
            private static void sumHelper$loopSome(Label label) {
                    Label newLabel;
                    do {
                            newLabel = label.next();
                    } while (newLabel == label);
                    return newLabel;
            }

My goal was to apply at a higher end school (i was A/B student), but I only have a C in precalc,,, and only a few grade 12 courses (I started not taking school seriously missed 191 classes last semester)

Ive since fixed my depression/not caring issue, but the issue still remains: my grades suck so I have to go to a shitty school now. Im really disappointed in this because Ive spent the last 4 years studying CS in my free time

 (and I know c++(main Lang)/python/c#, and have made 2D games with directX c++ and 3Dgames w/ c# unity engine, and Ive also studied a lot of reverse engineering or making external/internal debuggers/mods/cheats for applications/games. Ive also taken interest in general math needed in 3D graphical stuff... Ive also read books/online about algorithms, theory, low-level memory stuff) 

Right now Im starting to learn SQL with hopes of working on a larger project for income soon, but I feel Im at a huge disadvantage not being able to attend a better school.


In my position, whats the best path I can take? Im willing to put in the hours, but how necessary is post-secondary?

without naming any schools, my current option would be upgrading at college for 2 years and only then starting university, which feels wasteful considering Im allready at at least a first or second year level as far as what Ive studied. I know my situation is my own fault, but I feel like my school is now going to interfere with my eradication.

Im not sure if this is the right place to post this (feel free to point me to another subreddit, if not). Im planning on applying for PhD programs in a year or two after I finish my Masters and want to do everyone I can to prepare.

A little background info..... Im not doing CS, but I figured all of you would be the most knowledgeable on all things tech. Im interested in the digital humanities (this is broad and can include everything from building VR museum exhibits to software design for humanities research or 3D mapping historic sites, building digital tools for archaeological research, etc.). Right now Im in an interdisciplinary MS program that combines applied anthropology (your typical social science with lots of stats and both qualitative and quantitative research methods) with web development and information science. My main Anthropological focus is in linguistics/linguistic anthropology, so Im taking a lot of courses in linguistics as well. My thesis will consist of building online language archives for endangered languages and possibly building mobile apps for language learning/revitalization (depending on what my thesis client needs/wants). Id like to continue this kind of work for my PhD and get into computational linguistics/AI/machine learning for studying endangered languages and building resources for their revitalization.

This is a bit of a side interest, but Im also interested in working with digital libraries and large museums that build interactive, VR/AR exhibits. The Smithsonian has been doing cool stuff with this the last few years and Ive been fascinated with it. Linguistics is my main focus, of course, so this is more for fun.

I guess what Im asking is: what kind of skills do you think I should be focusing on in preparation for work like this? My Masters is part time and I teach abroad so my work hours are kind of low with plenty of vacation time. I have the spare time and funds to work on this, so Im not opposed to paying for some type of online course (especially in the summer when Ill have even more free time), but free resources where I can kind of teach myself would be appreciated.

Basically, I had an idea that involves making a program in Visual Basic 2010 that takes a list of (user selected) items and chooses one item from them randomly. I have made the interface and certain parts of the code, but I'm really having trouble with getting the RNG to only pick from the items the user chose. The main problem I have is that the RNG chooses a number from 1 to the specified limit, and since i have assigned each item on the list to a number, I am unsure of how to limit the RNG to only generating numbers that are selected. For example, if only items 3 and 4 out of 20 are selected, the program generates a number 1-4 ( i don't know how to make it only generate 3-4). The main problem with this is that selection 3 is way more likely to be chosen, because if 1 was randomly selected, the program goes down the list until it finds an item that is able to be selected and shown (and 3 is the closest), which means that the number 3 has a 3/4 chance of being selected, and 4 has a 1/4 chance. Any ideas of how I could reformat the code to be able to select from only the selected items would be greatly appreciated. If you need clarification, I'll be more than happy to try and clarify.

I personally come from a Banking &amp; Finance background and have absolutely zero knowledge on the subject.

Learning programming seemed really daunting at first, especially coming from a finance background but the more time I spent on it made me realise that it isn't that difficult once you manage to break down the concepts.

I'm doing a lot of looking into encryption algorithms, you know, just for some half-term reading before I go back to school.

I am now familiar with both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, but here's the thing: I am completely confused how it's possible to use a key to encrypt something, and it not being able to decrypt it - in the example of public/private key encryption, and the SSL protocol, a public key, which is A-OK to be seen by anybody, is generated, usually by a certificate (I may have misread, although that's what I saw), and then people have their own private key which can be used to decrypt the message.

Question time:

1. How is it possible to generate a key that can encrypt a message but not decrypt? Are there any examples of how it's done, specifically?

2. How are private keys generated such that they can decrypt a message? I've heard that these encryption algorithms are based on prime numbers - does this play into that, or can this be done without prime numbers?

Thanks!

    I am a 32 year old teacher with a bachelors in English and Political Science and an Masters in teaching. I have been teaching for 6 years now and each year it gets harder and harder to do. We are grossly overworks and equally underpaid. 
I have been jaded by disciplinary problems, administrative apathy and being constantly unsupported by anyone other than my fellow teachers. Coding and programming always piqued my interest, but because it went into  college with the desire to go to law school, my undergraduate degree was merely a stepping stone for what I really wanted. Well, I got to law school and realized I hated it. So I did an intensive 1 year masters program at Pitt and started teaching. Recently I have been trying desperately to find a way out, and heard about code academy. Since then I have devoted the majority of my free time to starting from the ground up and learning everything and anything I can. 
However I am afraid that because I don't have a formal degree in computer science, that all my efforts and time spent learning computer science and how to code will be for naught. I am reaching out to see if there was a way I could enter the field of computer science without a formal degree?

I recently graduated and received my BS with honors.  I also have three years of IT experience.  However, I'd like to make this clear.  I do not live for the work I do.   I am as interested in both of these jobs I am about to list, as I am with any other job in the tech industry.  However, I never have trouble bringing myself to work, or studying new languages and technologies.  I have a few business ideas, but until those are up and running, I am going to have to work for *the man* lul.  I only plan to work at one of these companies for two years, as I will be relocating to whichever city my fiance will be pursuing her advanced degree in.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Job One:  HPC** 

I recently interviewed with this company a few days ago, and I think there is a strong chance they will give me an offer.  However, I believe I only have a couple of days to accept it if they do.  This job starts off as a one year internship, with the option to become a second tier scientist after that year.  The salary average for the two years will be 70,000.  

Skills required and used:

*  	^(Puppet,	Ansible,	Chef, and/or	other modern CM/orchestration tools) 
*  	^(RPM-based Linux	Operating Systems and Command Line	Interface (CLI)) 
* ^(programming (e.g., C, C++, Go) and/or scripting	(e.g., Perl, Python, bash)) 
*  	^(object-oriented design patterns and distributed development methodologies) 

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Close to home |Low starting salary, fairly small city, no security clearance needed|

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Two:  Systems Engineer** 

I am interviewing for this job at the end of the month.  The company invited me to a hiring event where they will pay for my hotel, rental cars, food, and flight.  I have reviewed the questions typically asked for this position within the company, and I feel I have a strong chance of flying home with an offer.  The two year salary for this position is roughly 70,000 as well.  

Skills required and used:

*  ^(VMWare, vCloud, vCO,) 
* ^(Automation, EMC, Storage,) 
* ^(VNX devices,)
*  ^(Windows administration,) 
* ^(MCSE,) 
* ^(Networking)
* ^(CCNA,) 
* ^(Cisco Utilization)

&amp;#x200B;

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Will have me obtain TS/SCI clearance, better starting pay, bigger city|Far from home, minimal programming knowledge required |

&amp;#x200B;

I have also read that having an active TS/SCI clearance can increase future salaries by 5,000-15,000, because companies may give the cost of a these security clearances as a bonus if they do not have to purchase them for the employee.  

There you have it though folks,  if you could help me out I'd greatly appreciate it.  I am looking for which job choice would lead to the better path of careers (monetarily).  I am basing this on whether or not the job will provide favorable experience for our current job market.  Keep in mind, I program on my own time and I will probably have a solid personal-project portfolio within two years as well.

This is a really easy puzzle for us humans. We logically look through the statements and can see that Steve must be between tom and Adam, then make the logical leap that Adam is shorter than tom. Then we know that the if statement holds true and that Adam is indeed the same height as Jill.

Im trying to understand how a computer might solve this OTHER than brute force.

Like lets say we removed ""Steve is shorter than Adam"". Then the puzzle becomes unsolvable because we don't have any information really about Adams height. A human can recognize this and say it. But a computer cannot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question: Is there any research into making a computer think like we do - relationally, spatially, so that it can know what it does not know and perform logical reasoning like we do? What should I look up if I want to learn more about this. ",15,30,False,self,,,,,

Anyways, I am looking for some advice regarding applying to college for a computer science major. I am 17, but next semester is when I will have to start worrying about college. 

Basically, I need some extracurriculars and activities involving computer science, programming etc. Now, before you state the obvious, let me set the scene for you.

I live in a (very) small town of 5,000 in North Carolina. My school is an early college with &lt;180 students. The classes are small and not varied. At this school, I take highschool and college courses. I am earning an associates in science currently. 

This school focuses on medical and business classes. There are no computer science / programming classes offered. There is information systems, but its not the same thing. I was thinking of taking those classes just because its the only thing offered.

Currently, I am involved in video game club. This is where I meet with other members and work on various programming projects. Thats one thing I have going for me. I am also working on projects with other teachers involving the raspberry pi. I am also working on solo projects, in hopes that o can mention them on my application as well.

My grades are fine, my GPA is 4.2 (weighted). I am trying to get involved with STEM programs around the area, but tbh they are hard to find. 

My main question would be, do colleges ask about activities involving programming that you do yourself? Say for example, I programmed and published a game on steam. Would it be appropriate to list it on my application?

I was dumbfounded. I did not say another word, but I wish I would have. How could you say that to an aspiring student? I would love to have another chance to chew this guy out.

I have been having great success with the exercises at the end of the chapters, but I have run into one that just isn't clicking. The question is:  

A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. Write a function called is\_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b. Note: you will have to think about the base case.

And the solution is:

def is\_divisible(a,b):  
 if a % b == 0:  
 return True  
else:  
 return False  
def is\_power(a,b):  
 if a == b:  
 return True  
 elif a%b == 0:  
 return is\_power(a/b,b)  
 else:  
 return False

I understand the modulus operator in the is\_divisible acts as a condition where any remainder indicates an unequal division, thus non-divisible with these arguments. But the second function I am baffled by. Base cases I thought only stopped infinite recursion and why must a==b? is this considered the base case? 

Secondly, I am still unsure how the second condition relates to a being a power of b. The question states only if both conditions are a is divisible by b and also a/b is a power of b. But how can we tell if a/b is a power if were still dont know if a/b is a power??

I've been using Reddit FOREVER but never posted anything, here goes my first post on here. \*sighs\*

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm in the 10th grade and I took an introduction to computer science course and passed it. I knew I wanted to do something with computers but after this class, I know I want to be a software engineer whether that be programming or web development. (Or is that pretty much the same job?)

&amp;#x200B;

You can tell by that last question I asked, I'm an actual noob at this. I'm just essentially asking for advice about what to do? What courses/classes should I take? I was told by friends that I should take some math courses which I plan on doing. What about the actual programming aspect? What languages should I learn or is it just to early to learn that? I know the basics of use of algorithms and some basic html/css and that's it. Someone hear please guide me on this lmao. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I'm new to Computer Science, I know basics of CSS/HTML and Algorithms. What are my next steps? I'm also in school and take specific classes if necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah.... first post on reddit, don't roast me. I tried my best. Thanks for reading this btw. You're awesome. \^ - \^

I need some advise about whether or not I should pursue a post-baccalaureate degree in CS or go forth with using the internet and networking, as my teachers, to transition from nursing to CS.  

**What I want to achieve:**

I want a career that doesn't directly involve holding the balance of someone's life in my hands. I'm pretty damn good at nursing, but burnt out from the politics and lack of support from management concerning the ""safety"" of the family members I take care of every night. If I can learn from written, online, and personal sources, I would prefer it to going through another four years of undergrad.

**Where I am caught at this point:**

I read through job applications on a daily basis to see what companies are looking for in a developer and a lot of them list a bachelor's in CS. I'm in Austin, but will be moving back to Dallas in the next couple of years, so it would be nice to stay PRN or part-time nursing while I learn how to code on my own, but how logical is it to get a full stack developer job with no formal education in the field?

The struggle and stress I endure as I try to complete my math requirements for the CS degree has been outrageously detrimental to my health- physically and mentally. I am currently in Calc 2, and for the life of me I can not grasp the concepts no matter how hard I study, and boy do I study hard. I don't know what the issue is, but I study hard and pay attention in class. I ask questions, go to tutoring, however I never do well on exams for any math class I have ever had. 

In high school, I got a D in geometry, and got a C? D? in Algebra 2. Come college, I got placed into Elementary Algebra and failed the first time, got a C the second time. Moved up to Intermediate Algebra, withdrew the first time, got a C the second time. Then came trig, and I had to Withdraw because I was about to fail. I transferred to a different Community college and the counselor gave me permission to join Calc 1, even though I have not yet taken the prereqs of Trig and Precalc. Therefore, I did not even make it to Calc 1, the only reason I was able to take the class is because the counselor didn't care enough to check if I taken the prereqs for it. I barely passed Calc 1,  probably with a 70% and with a really easy professor. As you can probably tell from the pattern, I take Calc 2, nearly fail so withdraw, and now I am taking Calc 2 and just failed my first exam badly (&lt;50%). Over this winter I took Physics 1, failed with a D and studied HARD for it. I am talking about hours and hours each day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have come to the conclusion that I am extremely mathematically inept and do not want to waste any more time trying to pass these math classes. The ONLY classes holding me back from transferring into a 4 year are MATH and PHYSICS !!!! I graduated HS in 2016! I should be completing my junior year of college already right now and graduating next year, yet I still have not transferred. 

My lack of success in mathematical classes my entire life has led me to believe I am retarded and have a low IQ! I literally think I am stupid or have some form of autism ( how sad is that) for not being able to grasp these concepts while everyone else around me does so! Now I really think I am retarded, and I can not possibly get my degree in CS because I am not mentally capable of doing so. I think I may have dyscalcula. If you think I am unmotivated or do not study- no way, Passing these classes is my priority at ALL times. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, I do enjoy programming and technology, so I am wondering- Should I continue on this precarious GPA Russian roulette path or take the less mathematically involved major of CIS? Exiting high school I knew I wanted to do computer science because of the aspect of coding, yet I knew that its very math intensive so I went into college with an undecided major. I decided to ""chase my dreams"" and go through CS and believed if I studied hard enough, I would be  able to do fine in math even though I have always been bad at it. Turns out, I was wrong. I have already completed all the CS courses in my college, so they will be a waste since I won't need them any more for my major, but repeating math and physics classes may be even more of a waste of time.

And I struggle to understand them. On the other hand, I am taking my first programming class, and learning how to program in C. This class is by far my favorite class because programming makes sense with my brain, and I find the creative problem solving really fun. I tend to be looking at problems in different ways than my engineering major peers, and it is helping me excel in the class. 

Therefore, I am wondering if I should change major. Although math is not my strongest subject, I can get through calc 1,2 and currently 3 with a solid C+,B. But the logic side of computer science seems more appealing to me. 

My strongest quality that has set me apart from people that are considerably more technically smart than me is my creativity, and I am think that computer science might more lend itself to my creative problem solving side. 

Should I change my major? If I changed after this semester I would still be on pace to graduate on time, so if anything I should make a decision before I take some classes over the summer. One of my worries about going into CS is that the career is boring, and you sit on your ass all day.
