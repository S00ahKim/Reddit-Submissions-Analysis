I was initially looking at Drexel, but the tuition would still be so much, even after the aid and reduced cost. I'm not sure if I want to graduate with 70-80k in debt just from that school alone. Another school I was looking at was Rutgers. Rutgers seems more manageable, and would likely have 40ish or so in debt by the time I finished.

My biggest concern is getting a good education, and also having internship opportunities at large companies. Drexel would be good for that, but the cost turns me away. Does anyone know if Rutgers is good? The New Brunswick campus is where I'd transfer at.

I am self-taught so of course there is tons of room for improvement. I live in a state where software is one of our top economic drivers. I have spent the larger half of my adult life working in the software/tech industry.

I am typically jealous of our engineers because they have to deal with a lot less annoying ass people than I, their jobs are more autonomous, they don't get harassed about showing up to 4 meetings in a day, they don't have to deal with our rowdy ass sales team, they get to show up to work late without getting into trouble, their offices are dark and vampirical, they get to work from home more than the rest of us, they could come to work in pajamas and no one would bat an eye, their employee turnaround is lower, their team is smaller... I know these things don't make the job ""easy"" - There are times when they are stressing out and their team is in complete chaos - but their job seems more enjoyable than mine. 

So I would love to hear from programmers...

I'm a freshman CS major who literally just started classes. I (somehow) qualified for and am now enrolled in one of my unversity's most difficult math courses.

I'm interested in computer science research, like AI. I recently did an internship at an AI research institute, and it seemed like many of the researchers there were mathematicians who knew how to code, rather than computer scientists. For this reason, I'm very interested in getting as advanced and sound a foundation in mathematics as possible.

On the other hand, I've never been exceptionally good at math. I got a 34 on ACT Math and an A in AP Calculus AB (with a lenient teacher, and not taking the AP test). I've been told that this course is usually recommended for those who scored 5's on AP Calc BC.

The course is:

&gt; designed for those interested in theoretical mathematics and perhaps theoretical (abstract) physics. It is a proof-based approach to learning calculus and requires the student to produce original, independent calculus proofs on a weekly basis.

&gt; an honors calculus sequence for talented students interested in mathematics.

On the first day of class, my instructor said that it will be ""Marine bootcamp for the brain,"" and that it's one of the hardest courses freshmen are allowed into.

I'm terrified of how difficult this course looks to be, but, if a serious foundation in math is going to be essential for complex CompSci research, then I feel I should suffer through it.

Am I overvaluing the role of complex math in subjects like **neural networks** and **cryptography**, or am I going to have to soldier through this course?

Thanks for your advice!",2,1,False,self,,,,,

My prof works almost entirely out of UNIX/Apple OS and seems unsure of how to set up my somewhat outdated window 7 computer for the course requirements. Currently, these are the instructions I've been given for setting things up:

Option 0: a Windows-only environment. This option uses only native Windows software. As such, it will be a very different environment from that on the CS system. In this configuration you will work at the command line in PowerShell. 1. Download and install a decent general-purpose editor.  Atom is a simple editor that seems to work OK with Windows. 2. Download and install two tools that will facilitate remote access to the CS system:  F-Secure SSH client  X Windows Client for Windows 3. Download and install the Python 3.6 Anaconda for Windows. 4. Download the file custom.css. We will go over the last steps of the Anaconda customization in class. Option 1: the Linux subsystem in Windows 10. I would recommend this if you want to be a Real Computer Scientist. This assumes your version of Windows 10 is sufficiently up-to-date (Build 16215 or later). 1. Download and install the following:  F-Secure SSH client  X Windows Client for Windows 2. Install the Linux subsystem. Select Ubuntu as the Linux distribution. 3. Once you have Ubuntu installed, go ahead and fire it up. 4. At the prompt, type wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86 64.sh and hit return. 5. When that download is complete, type wget http://www.cs.wm.edu/~rml/teaching/csci141/downloads/custom.css and hit return. We will go over the last steps of the Anaconda installation and customization in class.

I was wondering what you all thought about these instructions and if any of you have tips or tricks to help my computer function more effectively in this course, and possibly more easily bridge the gap between my outdated system and my classmates using newer laptops running Apple OS.

Lets say I make a game. Its an MMO type game where many players are in a server walking around. 
And lets say I wanted to give players the ability to code up add ons and add them to this game. 

Now lets say the game is programmed in Swift but some guy makes a feature where his character can fly but he programs it in C#. 

Is it possible to integrate that feature even though the feature is coded in a different language than the actual game is coded in? 

What factors am I missing that would make this possible or not possible. 

I know this is probably a very complex question, but the thing is I dont even know the term of what it is Im asking about so I havent been able to successfully do research on this.

I'm not looking for answers. I just feel like I'm missing a concept somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm taking an advanced programming class right now and we're working with algorithms and how to write more efficienct code. Right now, we're looking at the worst case/upper bound, called Big O. What order a function is, etc. I know how to do this for code and different types of loops, as this was covered in class with lots of examples, but the problems in the book that were assigned are not code, they just look like Calculus functions.

&amp;#x200B;

Every example that was given in class is in my notes and there wasn't a single example that is like what this set of problems is suggesting. I am not asking for someone to do these, just explain the missing link. I didn't miss any class days.

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

Estimate f using Big O notation as well as plain English:  f(n) = (2 + n) \* (3 + log(n)) 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do here. That's not code, I don't know how to step through it and calculate how many times a given statement runs.

&amp;#x200B;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {

   for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {

do this

   }

}

&amp;#x200B;

I do know how to do this. i = 0 runs once, i &lt; n runs n + 1 times, i++ runs n times, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry to ask for help. The above example that I gave is one of many problems in this set of questions on my homework that I don't understand how to do because an example was never given in class. All the examples were of code, not calculus functions.

I'm considering RBC Pineapple (referencing apple) main issue with that is that when people hear the club name they might not understand what the club is about and what we are doing in it.

I'm looking for any opinions-please suggest any club name ideas you guys may have, and give me intake on the name RBC pineapple

Grades that will be joining range from 8(14 year old) to 12 (18 year old), If anyone has ideas on how to market this club also lemme know-I've been considering using ""we teach you how to make video games"" as a type of branding since that seems to be what kids like.

I'm \*really\* new to java, and I'm working on the first project for my CS class. 

I'm supposed to make a while loop that prints integers to 25, stating each one as an even or odd number. I wrote this maybe 20 minutes ago (and it worked perfectly), and when I came back to it and tried to execute, it only prints the integers 0 and 1 (with the even/odd statement).  I'm just wondering why it doesn't print 2-25 anymore. Here's what I have:

public class P1C

{ 

public static void main ( String cheese\[\] )

{ int counter = 26;

int remainder1 = 2%2 ;

int remainder2 = 3%2 ;

&amp;#x200B;

while ( counter &gt; 0 )

{ counter --;

if ( counter == remainder1 )

System.out.println ( counter + "" is an even number."" );



if ( counter == remainder2 )

System.out.println ( counter + "" is an odd number."" ); 

}

}

}

The carry output of each adder goes to one of the inputs of the adder paired with the following flip-flop.

I've recently started on a bachelor in computer science. In this first semester we will have a course called ""Introduction to programming"", where we are learning the basics of programming with java. We are using the book ""Objects First with Java"". 

Years ago I took a bachelors in engineering(health care technology), so I already have some coding experience. In fact I have already read Object First, and while it is a great book for beginners, I don't think it really goes in detail about the java language. It's very basic.

This time I want to take my understanding of Java to a deeper and more advanced level. I want to learn all the details. 

What would be a great source to learn more about the language that I can read on the side of the curriculum? 

Is ""[The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html)"" any good or is it too basic?

This was one of the interview problems I encountered and was wondering what were the different optimal solutions?

The only obvious solution I could think of was to use a frequency counter for each user and maintain another counter to store the range information. On every data update, we can update the two counters accordingly

Ex: 

`user_frequency = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, c: '40', d: '2', e: '3'}`

`range_frequency = {'&lt;10': 2, '10-15': 1, '&gt;16': 2}`

Since nowadays data are one of the most ambitious resources, having a proposal for moving the owning of certain types of data to impartial public organizations would make sense. For example, the data about how users are moving, or about text features extrapolated by their emails or everything else is relevant to protect users from monopoles in the future. 

My idea is that we can no more go back to the time in which no data were collected. Instead, we should find a way to collect and store them in a fair way, so that users are not damaged and big companies can't achieve monopoles.

As I am new to encoding I can't figure out which kind of format this is as I need to differentiate between normal string values returned by string keys in Redis.

&amp;#x200B;

Also is there any way I can filter out such encoded values using a regex or anything else?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the code that I am trying to run 

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

client := redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{

		Addr:     ""localhost:6379"",

		Password: """", // no password set

		DB:       0,  // use default DB

})

&amp;#x200B;

client.PFAdd(""hll"", ""1"", ""2"", ""4"") 

fmt.Println(client.Get(""hll"").Val())

&amp;#x200B;

client.SetBit(""bm"", 2, 1)

cient.SetBit(""bm"", 9, 0)

client.SetBit(""bm"", 4, 1)

client.SetBit(""bm"", 13, 0)

&amp;#x200B;

fmt.Println(client.Get(""bm"").Val())

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

The output that I get from running this code is

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

HYLLA\[v\^C

(

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

If I set the same data structures from the redis-cli I get the following results when I run GET on these keys from the redis-cli

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

""HYLL\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x80A\\xee\\x84\[v\\x80\^\\xa2\\x8cC\\xf3""

""(\\x00""

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

Now I think getting the same values as that given by the redis-cli is a bit tough to do in my Go code since I will have to port the redis C code for serailizing such strings to Go so right now I am looking for a way to ignore such values and only accept the ones that come from normal string key-value pairs.

I'm very interested in learning computer science, specifically software engineering and furthermore machine learning/AI. I took some time off from school for unrelated reasons and now that I have my head on straight, I plan to go back and get my BS in Comp Sci and then an MS in Software Engineering. 

I will be going back in the fall of this coming year and wanted to get ahead of my coursework so that I could go to school FT and also do a FT job. I'm learning Python right now and VBA (VBA mainly for work) while also brushing up on my calculus. I have a few comp sci books already like: Introduction to algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, The C Programming Language, even some calculus books. 

I know that there's a lot to cover in comp sci and I'm trying to figure out what is the best to start out with to make my life the easiest. I feel like I also need to understand more about computers in general; there's just so much that I hear and see. If I wasn't deadset on doing this, I would honestly feel overwhelmed by the amount that I feel I need to learn.

My plan is to continue this ""learning ahead"" during school as I have time. 

Any recommendations on what I should learn first? Or any recommendations on anything that may be beneficial for me?

It uses embedding representation for each paper, so you can get recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations. Easy to run in Google Colab",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9g3g99/hey_rcomputerscience_i_made_a_research_paper/,Research2Vec,1537033883,"I made a research paper recommender for Machine Learning and Computer Science in general, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains 1,666,577 papers, mostly in the computer science field. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg


###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/Research2VecPublicPlayGround.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-0ggLs2r-5nWDWb-TNWqR2osaiXqNEsL

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&amp;D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

&gt; ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough &gt;enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). If using the title to search, don't forget to use only lower case letters only. 

https://snag.gy/3yjx2o.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

Insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change this line 

`extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 + paper3 + paper4`

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 4 to get a TSNE map of the recomendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in May 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 20 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 1,666,577 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit (kinda like Facebook SentEval https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval ) that I can use to tune the hyperparameters. 

This feedback will also be helpful in my future plans, where I am planning on incorporating several other measures of similarity, and then use a attention mechanism to weight them for a final similarity. One method of content analysis I would really like to use is Contextual Salience https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08493. Another was something another Redditor just pointed out is cite2vec https://matthewberger.github.io/papers/cite2vec.pdf

Using a combo like this would help in one of the reoccurring hard search cases I encountered in R&amp;D, which was trying to look up parameters of a particular method, when the method itself is not the focus of the paper. I was just actually encountering this issue when doing my project. I wanting to know more about what optimal hyperparameters others have found when working with embedding representations. This may not be the main topic of the paper, but it may have been described in the methods section of the paper. But this is hard to search for since paper searches mainly focus on the main subjects of the paper.

Of course, I would very much appreciate whatever feedback, questions, comments, thoughts you have on this project.

First, I apologize for the formatting I'm on mobile, and for if this not the place to ask or against subreddit rules, please delete this if it is. I'm at a bit of a cross roads and could use some advice. Bit of background, I finished undergrad in December 2016 with a degree in criminal justice and philosophy of law. My plan has always been to be an attorney since freshman year of undergrad, but now I've started my first year of law school and I hate it. 

During the year break that I had between graduation and now, I took a short professional development course at a local community college on programming and really enjoyed it. For a few months I was contemplating switching paths and going back for computer science I was even emailing advisors from schools about going back. Acceptance letter came and I stuck with law school, but I'm starting to think I made a mistake. Im going to give it some more time, at least the halfway point of the semester, before deciding what to do. 

Basically, if I wanted to switch gears and go for computer science what would the best way to go about it? From what I've read it seems that I could go back and get an associates, then get an entry level job and work on a bacehlors from there? What else would or should I be doing  to help me get into the field? From research I've done I'd probably be most interested in programming or information security.

&amp;#x200B;

Given is the Internet shown. The occurring local network work with switches. Computer A sends to computer H a UDP packet with the payload ""ABCD"". Show the essential parts of the Ethernet package leaving Computer A. Explain on all subordinate network levels how the payload of the UDP packet is routed in detail to computer H. Explain which network component makes which changes to the package. How many local Networks are there? How many switches are there?

I came up with an answer but I have a feeling I am missing something crucial.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is my answer:

Computer A knows the IP Address of computer H. So it creates an IP-Packet wrapped in an Ethernet Frame with the Payload string ""ABCD"" and the header of the frame has the mac address of the local gateway (the router). So computer A sends it and it reaches the switch. The switch looks at the header and sends it to the router because it knows the port and the mac address of the router. Computer F is the Router because it has two IP addresses (and also two mac adresses for each local host.) Router F opens the IP-Paket and Ethernet Frame and sees that Computer H is not in it's local network. So it creates an new ethernetframe and puts the IP\_Paket and the payload inside. The destination mac address of the frame is now changed. We repeat the process and this time it reaches Computer G. Computer G (the router ) looks at the header and sees that computer h is in it's local network. If Computer G knows the Mac Address of Computer H it will send it to Computer H otherwise the Router will send an Arp Request. If it sends and Arp Request all the other Computers will get the message and H will send an arp response and G will send the Paket. Computer H will open the ethernet Frame and the Paket with the payload ABCD.

Determining the number of coins needed to make change 
 
Say you were a cashier and had to give a customer 68 cents in change. What combination of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies would you need to do that? You would first determine the number of quarters needed:  
 
	a quarter is 25 cents, so 68 / 25 = 2 remainder 18...meaning 2 quarters with 18 cents left over for everything else. 
 
then determine the number of dimes needed: 
 
	a dime is 10 cents, so 18 / 10 = 1 remainder 8 (we use the 18 cents left over from calculating the quarters...), so we have 1 dime in our change with 8 cents remaining. 
 
then determine the number of nickels needed: 
 
	a nickel is 5 cents, so 8 / 5 = 1 remainder 3, so we have 1 nickel in our change, with 3 cents remaining 
 
finally, determine the number of pennies needed: 
 
	we have 3 cents remaining...so that means 3 pennies in our change. 
 
So all total our change is: 
 
	2 quarters 
	1 dime 
	1 nickel 
	3 pennies 
 
The FinancialCalc#findCoins() method will, when complete, figure out the coins needed for a particular amount of change. It returns a string formatted to indicate the numbers of each coins. The format is: 
 
&lt;# of quarters&gt;Q&lt;# of dimes&gt;D&lt;# of nickels&gt;N&lt;# of pennies&gt;P 
 
So for our example, the return value would be: ""2Q1D1N3P"" (note that the &lt; &gt;'s are not part of the return value). 
 
You are to complete the FinancialCalc#findCoins() method so that it passes all the tests in the TestFindCoins class. You will do this a piece at a time by following the rest of the instructions in this section. 
 
1.	Decode the number of quarters: The number of quarters will be numberOfCents divided by 25...in integer division. Add code to the method body that does this and returns the proper string with the correct number of quarters in it (leave the numbers for the other coins at zero). If you do this correctly, the testShouldDecodeQuarters test should now pass. DO NOT modify the test class. 
 
2.	Decode the number of dimes: The number of dimes will be the remainder left over after finding the quarters, divided by 10. (Hint: remember you can use the modulo operator % to find a remainder!) Add code to the method body to perform this calculation, and to modify the return string to include the new number of dimes. If you do this correctly, the testShouldDecodeQuartersAndDimes test should now pass. DO NOT modify the test class. 
 
3.	Decode the number of nickels. Using what you know now, modify your code so that it passes the testShouldDecodeQuartersDimesAndNickels test. DO NOT modify the test class. 
 
 	 
Correcting a bug using tests' feedback 
 
The FinancialCalc#splitRestaurantBill() method is already written, but some of its tests fail. 
 
1.	Read the method's specification to understand what it should do. 
 
2.	Run its JUnit tests. Look at the feedback  especially the actual &amp; expected values  given by the failing tests and think about what may be going wrong. 
  
3.	Correct the bug(s) in FinancialCalc#splitRestaurantBill() so that the tests pass. DO NOT modify the test class. 
 
 	 
Write a method from scratch 
 
1. In the FinancialCalculator class, write a method: 
a.	named calculateMonthlyTakehomePay 
b.	that returns double 
c.	that has two parameters: 
i.	a double named yearlySalary 
ii.	a double named taxRate 
d.	that returns 0.0 (for now) 
e.	with the following specification: 
/** 
*	Calculates monthly take-home pay given an annual salary and a tax rate. 
 *  
*	@precondition yearlySalary &gt; 0 AND 0 &lt;= taxRate &lt;= 1 
 *  
*	@param yearlySalary an annual salary 
*	@param taxRate tax rate, expressed as a number between 0 and 1  
*	(i.e., a 25% tax rate would be 0.25)  * @return take-home pay for one month 
 */ 
 
2.	Un-comment all the tests in TestCalculateMonthlyTakehomePay. If you have compile errors that means you did something wrong in step 1, so go back and correct those. 
a. Hint: you can un-comment several lines of code at once by: 
i.	Use the mouse to select everything you want to uncomment 
ii.	Right-click, select Source, then ""Toggle Comment"" 
 
3.	Run the tests. Most should fail (again, this is ok for now). 
 
4.	Modify the body of calculateMonthlyTakehomePay so that all tests pass. DO NOT modify the test class.

So let's say there are 200 videos for CN subject and the thing is that I've already made notes from them last year in my notebooks (there are 4 volumes of Classmate registers) but they're very lacking as say miss 40% of the course details/depth as in I've made them in a rush and skipped out most of the important things and you can say like they serve only half the purpose and not worth reading at all.

I'm not saying there's something wrong with the information written but it's very less or you can say I've written definitions only but, now I need in-depth details and those videos cover everything, but my issue is I can't watch all 200 videos from scratch and make notes totally from scratch as it'll take me more than a month and also my notes are not poor or have any wrong information it's just I wanna add or write the missing lines/concepts from those videos but now my notebook pages have no blank spaces/page left to add any new information.

Also it'll be way too compact, untidy, messy and you know concepts are made like a story unfold in a TV Show like you can't write about IPV4 if you don't know basics of IP addresses.

Now how can I update my notes i.e. add new information in them without to make the whole notes again?

I do have an iPAD and notability app and a stylus so can something be done digitally? Moreover I've a printer at home also and thus can something be done w/ that?

My PC is basically brand new, I've got steam installed as well as a couple of games. I have about 700gb free of 1tb mostly from games.

All I know is that it is not an internet issue because it hAppens even when I'm just opening my file explorer.

I thought perhaps it could be background programs running and pushing the CPU(or something idk if it's a CPU problem) too hard but there is like 50 programs in my task manager(in the ""more details"" tab) and I'm not sure what I can close and what will screw up my PC if I do. 

Also if someone could PM and I'll send a screenshot of my task manager+all programs running if you could highlight what can be ended that would be really helpful as well.

I'll also include current percentages (while on desktop no programs running).

- CPU 51%

- Memory 42%

- Disk 0%

- Network 0%

- GPU 0%-2% (fluctuating)

Which of these is most important for speed and how can I lower them if needed?

Besides that I thought perhaps there could be some programs I could uninstall maybe, like ones that I don't use or just came default when setting up the PC . I thought maybe that some programs might be auto running on startup and slowing me down or something? I may be way off on this but idk. 

I thinking of possibly doing a disk defrag aswell(or whatever it's called). Would that help any? 

Also if there are any other little tips and tricks to help speed up a PC that I could try I'd really appreciate it.

I've had a few guys in the IT field be real jerks to me when im asking for help saying I'm stupid or something like that or going on rants about ""people like me"" and honestly as an adult I find that type of behaviour completely uncalled for and unhelpful.

So I'm hoping someone will try to help without any condescending comments on how dumb I am for not knowing about my computer or how I'm an idiot giving bad/unhelpful information in my question because honestly I dont know what half of the acronyms mean or what an ""application frame host"" is or any of that.

So im working on a project for my algorithms course which is essentially a linked list implementation of a long (but since a LL potentially of any size) and I had a little memory question I was unsure about and didn't have a chance to bring to my professor.

For this project, we have to create a method to sum (the class takes a boolean negative, so this means the method adds AND subtracts) two of these LL longs/integers. This method is supposed to handle the addition/subtraction of two integers of any size, so, obviously, there is a fair amount of logic here with dealing with a positive/negative carry, subtraction/addition, and so on. I figured it would be easiest for me to start by just writing the method independently, that is, not having any ""helper"" methods to handle any repeated logic at each step, instead, just simply repeating the logic in the method.

Now, my question here is, is it more efficient memory-wise to divvy this method up by calling other logical/computational ""helper"" methods, rather than repeating the logic and having it checked at each step? For instance, at each step, I have logicals that check if we retained a pos/neg carry from the last step, nested in this logic I have logicals to check, if we did retain a carry, does this carry result in another carry, etc; would I save space by instead of checking this within the actual function, I used a ""helper"" method to check this? It would obviously make my code more readable and fewer lines, but I was wondering if its actually the efficient choice.

Im not sure if this question is super clear, so I can give an example of my code if it isn't clear!

&amp;#x200B;

Made over two thousand years ago the Antikythera mechanism was a computer used to calculated the positions of the moon, stars and planet. Found by divers off the coast of Greece in 1901, the small rusted computer was encrusted with millimeter (1/2 inch) text, with more than 3,500 characters of explanatory text carved in it. Using radioactive dating, it is estimated to be 2,100 to 2,200 years old. Now it rests in the Katerina Laskaridis Historical Foundation Library in Athens, where you can go see it. It has seven major fragments, all but one with enscriptions, and two of them were found separate from the original finding, one in 1976, one in 2005, along with many minor fragments. The first found is 370 grams, and composed of 27 gears, and measuring 180 by 150 millimeters. The second is a 125 by 60 millimeter, 100 gram gear, the third is a 60 gram, 120 by 110 millimeter gear, the fourth is a gear, 45 by 35 millimeters, weighing 15 grams. There are three more, one weighing 20-25 grams, and 60 by 35, one weighing 85 grams, 90 by 80, one weighing 30-35 grams, and 125 by 110.

The mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a crown gear to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets. The operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a ""follower"" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.

On the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial, which represents the ecliptic (the twelve zodiacal signs) marked off with equal 30 degree sectors. The fixed ring dial representing the ecliptic is matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the constellation boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic Egyptian calendar, twelve months of 30 days plus five intercalary days. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the Greek alphabet. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.",6,15,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I watched videos about GATEBOX (they didn't pay me to write about it), and I 

&amp;#x200B;

plan to DIY my own Virtual Girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/t9s59q4rmbn11.jpg

My current skillset is that I have never touched any hardware before. Single-chip 

&amp;#x200B;

microcomputer, raspberry pi, etc, never laid my hands on any of those. I am a dummy programmer, and I know little about 3D modeling.

&amp;#x200B;

In my imagination as a dummy programmer, a Vitual Girlfriend will consist of the following parts:

&amp;#x200B;

1.Physical existance. Just use hologram.

&amp;#x200B;

[2.Design](https://2.Design) of the look. 3D modeling.

&amp;#x200B;

3.Her Soul. Should be able to perform the easiest voice-interation. I say hello to her and she should be able to say hello back. Thus, sound input and output would be involved here. In terms of speech recognition, there are simple solutions and extremly complicated solutions that's close to mission impossible for me.

&amp;#x200B;

OK, well, so now **I know nothing**. Starting from step one, I did none of these things before. I plan to record the whole process of me learning, making mistakes, making progress and how to put things together (maybe I will make videos of it), step by step, so other people can just follow me if they want, and make their own robot, **until I stuck somewhere and cannot move on.**

&amp;#x200B;

Virtual Girlfriend 101------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Step one, based on my research, there are many different hologram solutions out there.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are in USA, you can open Amazon to search ""hologram""/""3d hologram""/""phone hologram"", etc, and you will find some products available. Actually it is just a piece of plastic so if you are good at DIY, maybe you can just make one yourself.

One thing I've encountered, by the way, are the number of explanations for how J/K flip flops work which are just *wrong.* Meaning the circuits shown simply won't work. (I'm looking at you, [Circuit Digest](https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/jk-flip-flop-truth-table-working/)... Redo their representation of a JK flip-flop as transistors on MacSpice--and you don't get a ""race condition"" when the clock line is on while J and K are one. What you get are the transistors making up the S/R gate dropping to zero, and the one that turns on after the clock goes to zero is pretty random.)

Anyway, I'd love some feedback.

I am 17 years old and in highschool. I have only ever ran Linux or BSD, I have never used Windows or Mac *except at school they make us use Windows, however I barely use it even there.* The distros I have run are as follows:

Ubuntu 12.04/17.10 *run for a total of 3 years*

Mint Linux *exact versions unsure run for 3 1/2 years* 

Arch Linux *run for 1/2 years*

OpenBSD *run as a VM while running Mint and Arch Linux*

I am currently learning my first coding language, Python, and about to start a few projects. First project a simple neon space invaders game, second project, a Linux/BSD terminal, third unknown, last project a bot named pandabot.

So the first 2 years of my university course were intense. My course has A LOT of assignments - at least 3-4 a week which count towards a small % of my degree. Second year was the worst as I had 10 exams in a 3 week exam period. So understandably, it makes sense why someone would struggle in this degree.


Now, my biggest issue which makes me not do well is my confidence. I think I'm stupid compared to my peers. This is something I am working on and I'm more aware of, I have seen a counsellor about it too. But when I started university, it was the first time I ever struggled intellectually. And as female, you do get some male students who do talk to you like you're an idiot too. I started to believe I actually was stupid.


I've noticed I'm too scared to mess up. Whenever it comes to assignments, I panic about wrong answers, constantly ask friends for help when I actually don't need it. And a lot of the time, it turns out I actually did know the answer but I didn't let myself say it or research into it because I thought I was wrong. 


for example, my Haskell module I worked so hard for. When it came to the exam, I panicked.  I have a problem that when I see a question I don't know the answer to straight away, I panic and convince myself I don't know the answer and how dumb I am. So I failed the exam after not being able to answer a single question. For my resit, I looked at the paper again and realised I could've solved at least 60% of the answers but I was too scared to even attempt to answer them. I guess I have a huge mental block which I can't get past. Starting is always the hardest for me because I'm scared to have fun with programming and mess around with code because I don't want to break anything.


I am getting better at this problem! I did a summer internship which boosted my confidence massively, thanks to my mentor. I am ready to smash this year and don't want to lose this extra confidence I have gained. 


Does anyone have any tips for how to not let yourself feel sad when you don't get a good grade? Or how to just have fun with the work? How do you maintain confidence when you make mistakes? Thank you. ",5,9,False,self,,,,,

Year 2 is fully emerged into Cyber Sec and would probably secure me a job easier in Cyber Sec. ",1,2,False,self,,,,,

So i would like to know the opinions of people on this thread if they could help me find something that can be done

i know that most of you guys here must have had this thought of ""i wish the university had this service, it would make my life easier as well as the staff""

* I know there's many Google results for the topic, but most of the search results seem pretty old. IMHO a StackOverflow/Quora thread from 2011-2016 isn't really relevant anymore.
* Not asking on StackOverflow because this seems like the kind of subjective debate that would get closed down.
* I have no interest in being in academia or research - is MATLAB used in industry by any modern companies? I hear anecdotally from friends that they've never used it outside of class. Would love some confirmation or refutation.

Given the above...I'm currently in a pretty old-school Computer Vision class that has been re-using the same assignments for several years, hence why the starter code is given in MATLAB. Prof said that if I wanted to go to the effort of translating the MATLAB code to Python and submit that instead, that would be fine. I'm leaning towards doing so, as I haven't really seen any compelling long-term reasons to learn MATLAB. I don't mind learning a new language, but I don't really want to do so if it's not used by anyone in industry in any substantial way.

Would getting an associates degree in this field be relatively difficult for someone in my position? Or, from your experience, would this program be doable?

From reading some of the posts on here, it seems that getting an associates degree in computer science would be best because I can learn the basics and go on to further my education specifically in Cybersecurity; however, I am no good at math and it appears that quite a few math courses are required for the computer science degree (the Cybersecurity program Im looking at requires less math classes than the Computer Science program).

Im torn on what I should do - do I go for the CS associates degree? Do I go straight for the cyber security associates degree? Or do I need to brush up on my knowledge of computer science as a whole before spending money for a program I would not do well in since I am not already that educated in the subject?

I wouldnt mind obtaining the degree in Computer Science, but again it is the math that worries me.

I do already have a BA in sociology so Im hoping that for any program I do enroll in much of my general education requirements could transfer over, leaving me space for other lower-level computer science courses that are not already required by either program.

Sorry if my wording is a bit confusing/repetitive. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

*TL;DR* - I'm looking for material to read in order to understand how to build a comparison engine, say sites like Google Shopping, PriceGrabber etc.

The easiest way to do this would be to check if the sellers publish an SKU/UPC or a similar identifier which is the same everywhere and I can easily compare them across websites.

But how do I compare products with when I don't have a UPC. I can write two different examples of scenarios where the logic would be completely inverted.

For example, two stores selling
- iPhone 6
- New iPhone 6

Now, both the products are same, it's just that the second store added a NEW keyword to it.

Another example that works differently would be two stores selling
- MSI GTX 960 
- MSI GTX 960 Gaming
- MSI GTX 960 WindForce
- MSI GTX 960 SomethingElse

Now all of these products are different from each other.

Are there any books or articles that I can read to understand how this matching works?

My brother had a wedding I Spain and my mom booked me to fly out there so I missed an entire week of fucking school. I know I could have refused to go but it's my brother and it's the right thing to do but that's not why I'm failing. I took those exams before then so I can't use that as an excuse but it did set me back homework wise.

For some reason I don't understand physics I try to and I still make little to no sense of it. I read the book but still don't understand how to solve basic problems for whatever reason which makes me feel like a complete idiot. Calc 2 is so difficult for me when I do the homework it makes some kind of general sense then go in to take the once a week quiz and my brain just goes blank because the problem looks like something I haven't seen before was never in any for in the homework problems so I don't know what to do with it and I have this dumb stare as I have zero idea how to solve it. I'm a shitty programmer. Or I feel like one. I feek like everyone knows what they are doing and I don't  know anything. I go in to tutoring or to the professor to get help (not as much as I would like due to class being during office hours)  and I honestly just feel like I'll never graduate with a degree ever because I've went through graphics design I didn't like that. I went through nursing and I decided I hated people after a certain incident that caused me to not want to care for others.

Now I'm in a major that I like but I'm complete trash at. My GPA was great until I switched then all of a sudden things were much harder here in the school of engineering. I cry like once a week in my car knowing my scholarship is slipping away and I just need a little pep talk reality check. It's been about a month and some days into school I know a semester is 16 weeks but if I don't grasp this shit I am screwed.

My boyfriend is a graduated computer engineer, straight A student, brilliant programmer and Everytime I look at him I just look at myself and see ""failure"" and ""I'm too stupid to be in this major"" or ""I'll never be as smart as him""

Today I broke down which he hasn't seen me do in a while. He had no idea how horribly I was actually doing in school and I recently told him. Previously I would just be pitiful and cry in my car whenever I got overly stressed about school. I know I'm too damned fucking old to be crying but I get so stressed out and anxiety filled that I get scared I'm going to lose my scholarship money and have to go home I get scared of disappointing my mom, my boyfriend , myself. I get anxiety about the fear of never graduating. Anxiety about finals that are so far away. I get anxiety just trying to even get the help that I need. And it's weird for me because I haven't been away from home before. I'm 21 just now experiencing going away for college and I'm terrified that I don't have my mom here to tell me I'll be fine. But my boyfriend who is smart as a whip who will never understand what it's like to fail anything because he never has in his life. 

I feel inferior to other engineering students and computer science students around me. I feel inferior to everyone because of how poorly I've performed over this past month. I know crying doesn't solve anything but it helps me feel better. That's the only coping mechanism I have as pitiful and stupid as it is.",19,24,False,self,,,,,

Well, my question is a bit strange, I know.

I think everyone knows what is a quine: a program who prints its own listing.

[Citing Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing\)):

&gt; A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.

My problem is with the ""cheating quines"". Citing the Wiki again:

&gt; Quines, per definition, cannot receive any form of input, including reading a file, which means a quine is considered to be ""cheating"" if it looks at its own source code. The following shell script is not a quine:

&gt; &gt; \#!/bin/sh

&gt; &gt;\# Invalid quine.

&gt;&gt; \# Reading the executed file from disk is cheating.

&gt;&gt; cat $0

Now my problem is: if it can't receive any form of input, how can we use functions like `printf`? After all, they need an input.

It can be complicated a bit if we use some hackish languages. An acquaintance of mine said some asm languages have commands to disassemble. Then, an assembly program can `disasm`itself, from memory only. Suppose we have a function `disasm pos1 pos2`, where `pos1` and `pos2` are memory locations containing all code. Then, the program below in theory prints itself:

    _start:
    disasm _start _end
    _end:
    
The assembly environment (say, `nasm` plus linkers and loaders and all else) will substitute the labels by their memory locations in the final executable.

I think it is a convoluted way to 'cheat', but I can't find an useful definition of quine in order to avoid that.

Therefore, my title question: how can we define a quine satisfatorily?

I cannot seem to suggest good/any algorithms for problems that come up in my class or in chapter 1 of my professor's textbook. I'm definitely lacking something, but can someone provide me with a good source so that I can get around that? The textbook I've been using (that isn't my professor's) is _Introduction to Algoritms_ by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. I've read through only the first ~110 pages, but I feel like it just teaches how to solve stuff optimally rather than how to try and fit something to an arbitrary runtime.

I'll provide a couple of examples regarding stuff that I don't even know how to approach. I'm not asking for solutions for these, but just sources that I can look at to tell me how to start dissecting these on my own:

1) We're in a building _n_ floors tall, and we have _k_ students. We want to find the lowest floor such that if a student jumps off then they die. The only way to test this is to have a student jump off. If student _i_ jumps and lives, student _i_ is the next to jump; if not, then student _i+1_ is up next. Assuming that _k &lt; ceil(log_2 n)_, *propose an algorithm that runs in O(k + n / 2^(k-1)) time.

2) For any string S containing only 0's and 1's, a string is _balanced_ if the number of 0's equals the number of 1's. Propose an algorithm to find the maximum balanced sub-string in *a) O(n^2) time, b) in O(n) time.*
