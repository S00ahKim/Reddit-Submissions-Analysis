Our material is talking about adders and adding binary. 0 + 0 = 0, 1 + 0 = 1, and 1 + 1 = 0 with a carry-out bit, correct? My problem is the table given in the material. The formulas we're given are Sum = A + B + C-in. If line 5 is C-in(1) + A(0) + B(0), that would be 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 with no carry-out bit. So where does the carry-in bit on line 6 come from? Shouldn't that carry-in bit be 0 since the last line didn't have a carry-out bit? And if that's the case, it will change the rest of the table, right? The first table is what we were given. The second table is what I get when I go through and do the math. I've tried calling my professor but he doesn't have voicemail setup, so I'm kind of out of options. If I posted this in the wrong sub, I'm sorry. This is the only one I could find that I thought would be applicable. Thanks for your help!

I guess my question is, has anyone else come across this problem?

Bachelor of Engineering (Software Engineering).

Bachelor of Science (Computer Science).

Honestly to a normal person the Bachelor of Engineering sounds better. And apparently to my mum, it sounds A LOT better... which is kind of why I'm asking this. My mum won't stop mentioning this and seems like it's a massive deal. I know it's not, but I still want to know which is better.

Right now my math skills are weak but the class I am in will allow me to get into a credited higher level-MAT which is very attractive for transferring if I can get a B(80) so far I have almost a 100 in it currently. However, that's not what I fear. What I fear is I may not understand CS itself as well as comprehend the much much higher difficulties of MAT that are required. I really do like computers, Iv always liked them since I was a kid. Everyone turns to me when they need help with their computers and somehow I manage to solve simple issues.

Iv watched CS classes on youtube, and even took notes on the terms used by the professor.

Sci major please!,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/3kcdka/need_help_deciding_what_i_should_be_doing_as_comp/,shutupanddancewithme,1441854755,"TL;DR I'm thinking of dropping Calc 2 and my desire to pursue a minor in math. Looking for some advice as to what cs courses might be helpful to me please!

So I'm a junior at Boston University and, as the title suggests, I'm a comp. sci major. I'm at best an average student with a GPA of 3.30.

So far, I've taken two intro courses to CS, a course on combinatoric structures, and one on computer systems. (Also, I've completed all my liberal arts requirements already.. which might have been a mistake).

Currently, I'm taking a course in Linear Algebra/Geometric Algorithms, Algebraic Algorithms, and Concepts of Programming Languages. I'm also taking Calculus 2.

Now here's my dilemma. At the end of last semester, I thought that I wanted to get a minor in Math. However, after talking about it with a friend and looking at a few stack exchange discussions, it seems that a minor in math might not be all that useful when pursuing a career (I definitely welcome anyone to refute that though because I'm extremely ignorant and will believe almost anything on the internet.. as long as they come from credible sources ofc...). I say it might not be useful because, at the moment, I just don't see how practical/beneficial the math courses I'll need to take will be in a future job.

Also, if I pursue the math minor, I'll have to take two of the course requirements (while maintaining four classes per semester - three cs classes and some other additional class) either by overloading on classes in two of my remaining four semesters or by taking them during the summer. I don't know if I'll be able to handle 5 classes (especially since people tell me taking 3 cs courses is already a handful), and taking the summer courses at my college is hella expensive. Obviously everything comes at some price, but again - I'm not certain at all if I want to commit myself to these things.

Anyways, it would be awesome if I could get some feedback and advice from more experienced individuals. I'm thinking about dropping Calc 2 and the math minor, but I don't know what classes to take that will keep me occupied with a 4-class semester until I graduated, not be too heavy in workload (though I can definitely try my best to keep up), and are guaranteed to be useful in the future. Is it practical/worthwhile to take classes that count for literally nothing and are taken just for fun?

Im reading the book Computer Science and overview by brookshear and something is not clicking. 

Yes this is a homework question but ive changed so that i can learn and do the work myself. Im just starting to learn machine language.

Write a machine language program that starts at address 00, puts the hexadecimal value 4B into the memory location C5, puts the hexadecimal value 17 into the memory location 62, exchanges the values at locations C4 and 62, and then halts. NOTE: there is not a machine language instruction called exchange the values You will have to figure more than one machine language instruction to complete that part of the task. 


All the examples in the book a written in four bits. The first being the op-code, the second being the operand, and the last two being the data to be manipulated. 


So to store the value 4B i would use 2X4B, the X would be the register but how would i represent C5 location in that bit. I feel like there is something simple im missing, or maybe im way out in left field.

Right now im doing computer science on a university. I need to make the following questions for tomorrow but Im not sure wether Im doing it right. Because I dont have any experience with computer science ans just have lessons for a week now, Im not that confident.

&amp;nbsp;


1) which device is connected to a fast controller and which one is also able to be connected to a slow one?
a)network card-fast otherwise lag on connection b)Mouse-slow because it doesnt need that much attention c)Keyboard-slow same reason d)Soundcard-fast otherwise you will get lag on your sound e) dvd player-fast but not sure why
 
&amp;nbsp;


2)if the time to get a word from the memort is 100nsec and to get a word from cache is 10nsec, the hit rate of cache is 90%, whats the average time to get a word? Answ: (9x10+1x100)/10=19nsec

&amp;nbsp;


 
3) 32-bits computer we want 64segments how many bits do the segments need and whats how big can the segments be? Answ: 26 =64 so 6bits 232 /64=67108864
 
&amp;nbsp;


4) 32bits 16kb, how big can the pagetable be? And whats the % in the memory?
Answ: 232 / 16x210 x4then the answer/232 x100=0.02%

5)this time 64bits with 64gb memory
264 / 16x210 x8 then the answ/something I dont know its smaller than the adress??

For the first two years I haven't really programmed outside of the classroom setting, and I feel that my apathy toward both 1. Programming on my own personal projects and 2. Not working towards getting an internship have cost me dearly in terms of atrophied and under developed skills. Im looking to learn some more technologies and take on some personal projects to try and get back into the game so to speak, but am daunted as to where to start.

Things I know ""relatively"" well are Java, C++, C, and Python with basic knowledge of how to use terminal, bash, etc and passing familiarity with git, flask, and other programs. My main questions are then as follows.

1. Would it be better to try and come up with a fairly large project, such as a game or app or something, and continuously work on that to improve my skills or would it be better to try and do smaller contained problems such as those found in cracking the coding interview that focus more on algorithmic skills and approaches to problems as opposed to pure syntactical knowledge.
2. What technologies would be in my best interest to learn (and preferably most interesting) in order to land a junior summer internship at a reasonable tech company. It doesn't need to be google but something would be better than nothing.
3. Any general advice you would give to someone in my position.

For as long as I can remeber I have wanted to go into computer science. I love coding (although I don't know a whole lot) and I especially love computers and computer gaming. I planned to get a computer science degree and persue something in the cyber-security field. I'm in my first year at a 4-year university (did some time at community college) and it was then that I discovered just how much math I had to take. Don't get me wrong, I knew this was a math intensive degree, but more math than engineering students? I had no idea.

To even start working on my major I need to at least be in calculus, and my math at community college placed me into a pre-calc class. We are 3 or 4 weeks in and I am struggling a lot. I pay attention and take notes in class, I ask questions, and I feel like I know the material until I get to the homework or quiz which I fail.

I've failed two quizzes so far and I only do well on Homework because I have so many chances to get a question right. I'm stressed out, I'm fighting with my girlfriend over this and I'm not even in the first math class needed for a compsci degree.

If I change majors, I don't even know what I would do, my whole life has been leading up to this and now I'm failing because I'm too fucking stupid to do pre-calculus. Does it get better? What should I be doing differently? Most importantly, should I be changing my major? ",10,4,False,self,,,,,

I've looked up different online sources and read the textbook over and over again yet I still can't find a way to do this properly

My professor gave us this binary : 1010101010

He said how the length is 10, and the exponent is 4, and the rest is the mantissa

So I split them apart as

1  0101 01010

So now I tried converting to a decimal

So the first bit is 1 so the answer is negative

Then the exponent is 4 and the normalized form of the mantissa always has a 1 in front of it

So I wrote the new mantissa as 1.01010

Then I moved the decimal point five places to the right because 0101 is five in binary

Now I'm not certain if that is entirely right, and because of that I'm not certain if it would be correct for me to move forward with converting to a decimal

I'm comfortable using JavaScript type stuff like Node JS, Express and Angular, and I was thinking of making some kind of hybrid Ionic/React app attached to an Express/Loopback.io backend, but I just need to some achievable, fun ideas that would be possible in the space of around 9 months in order to hips some kind of multi-user application in addition (possibly) to a web portal.

I have a few ideas already and I'm really keen to use this kind of stack (because I'll have a little bit of a head start) but I'm also open to alternatives!

I guess my (rather stupid) question is do you guys have any app concepts that might be good fits for a uni project of this type that maybe:
a) you thought would be useful
b) you thought would be a fun idea, you just couldn't be bothered 
c) you thought would be interest to have a go at developing, just to see if people would like it.

Any direction or advice whatsoever is appreciated!

I've heard conflicting things about EE, CS and CE majors so I just want to clear up some things. I feel like CS is more high level programming and doesn't deal with hardware that much, but CE would have both designing hardware and low level programming which is what I enjoy. Also, I know some schools group the three together while other schools group CS with Mathematics. Any thoughts or input on this?",3,0,False,self,,,,,

When I say backend I mean being able to recognise and utilise design patterns and being able to incorporate and use libraries into my code where appropriate.

I have a lot of ideas of things I could build in Java , but they are all ideas for websites with a Java backend. And such a website would involve a lot of frontend work to make it a complete project, which is not really what I want. I want to do a project where I can focus on and improve my Java skillset, not my frontend skillset.

And any other ideas I have are all kind of just pure algorithms. There are some fun AI algorithms I wouldn't mind implementing, but I don't think that would improve my backend skills that much.

Any ideas or places where I could look?

I was thinking of just buying a book (thinking in java or effective java) and just going through and coding up examples and example problems used in those books.

But I'd really like to have an idea like ""build a java program that can take X as input and produce Y.""

Maybe I'm over thinking it and if I were to build a simple CRUD app, putting very little effort into the frontend, then maybe this would be enough.",5,2,False,self,,,,,
