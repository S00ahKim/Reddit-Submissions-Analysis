so I just started reading about computer science. Never touched the field before. First it introduced me to algorithms, all fair and well. Went on to explain how a program is a representation of an algorithm.

Then it started looking at the history of computers, and mentioned how the abacus is a computer. 

I'm really confused. HOW is an abacus a computer? I realize a computer isn't necessarily digital, but where is the algorithm of an abacus? As I understood it, a computer is a machine that can follow a set of instructions, or algorithm. All the abacus does is to exist, whilst people move the things around. Yeah, they represent a value, but is that to say that anything that represents a value suddenly is a computer?

Maybe I've just got the definition of ""computer"" wrong, but keep in mind I'm fairly new to this field.

Formatting is a little more clear.


Question:  You are given an input , which is a sequence of positive integers `[;w_1, w_2, . . . , w_n;]` with parameters `[;W, \Delta.;]`. We wish to find `[;S \subset \{1, 2, . . . , n\};]` such that `[;\sum_{j \in S} w_j;]` is as large as possible, subject to the constraints that (a)`[;\sum_{j \in S} w_j \le W;]`,
and (b) for all `[;i, j \in S;]`, if `[;i \neq j;]` then `[;|w_i - w_j | \ge \Delta.;]` 

Below is what I have so far.


So Here is where I am getting stuck at. Lets sort the weights in increasing order `[;\{w_1,......,w_i\};]`. Now here is what I do know. If `[;|w_i - w_{i-1}| \ge \Delta;]` then `[;|w_i - w_j| \ge \Delta;]` for all ` [;j &lt; i;]`. So
``[;OPT(i,w) =
 \begin{cases} 
OPT(i-1, w) &amp; : \text{if  } w &lt; w_i  \\ 
OPT(i, w) = max(OPT(i-1, w), w_i + OPT(i-1, w-w_i)) &amp; :\text{if   } |w_i - w_{i-1}| \ge \Delta
\end{cases};]``




But my problem arises when `[;|w_i - w_{i-1}| &lt; \Delta;]`.  If `[;|w_i - w_{i-1}| &lt; \Delta;]` is true then I have three cases.

(1) The optimal solution has `[;w_i;]`. Which means that the optimal solution will contain `[;w_i;]` plus the optimal subset of the set `[;\{w_1,...,w_j\};]` where j is the closest weight to i such that `[;|w_i - w_j|;] \ge \Delta`. But the problem I'm having in the recursive formula is how do I figure out the j? Is the only way to figure it out is to ""loop"" through all the jobs backwards from `[;i, i-1,....,ij;]`


(2) Optimal solution contains `[;w_{i-1};]`. Here all you do is `[;OPT(i, w) = OPT(i-1, w;]`.

(3) Optimal solution contains neither `[;w_i;]` or `[;w_{i-1};]`. Here `[;OPT(i, w) = OPT(i-2, w);]`. The biggest problem I am having is to do with case 1.

Then, I simply take the maximum of (1), (2) and (3) to figure out optimal solution if `[;w_i - w_{i-1};] &lt; \Delta`

I hope we can talk about my research and maybe even come up with a solution. I'm a computer scientist who is interested in math but doesn't have much formal training at this kind of level. I think this is in the realm of Galois Theory or Ring Theory.

I say graduating, but there's a good chance I won't actually receive a degree despite completing all my requirements.  On top of that, my GPA plummeted in the past two years due to some rather extreme issues that have happened at home. Those two factors are definitely a big problem in job searching for me, but on the bright side, I have the basic skills that are expected of me (data structures, algorithms, all that fun stuff), and I'm a fairly bright person.  My long term goal (and it would be amazing if I could reach it right out of college) is to work abroad. I'd like to stick with an American company due to salary and benefits, but I'd like to move over to Taiwan, as I have friends and family there that I'd like to surround myself with (not to mention the low cost of living). What types of jobs and companies should I be looking at? Right now I'm just doing very general searches, which tends to lead to big corporations which extremely unlikely to even give me an interview due to low GPA (approx 2.8/4.0), or likely to retract any offer if I'm not granted my degree in May.  The companies that I've found that are telecommute friendly, either want high GPA, or want 3-5+ years experience.  Are there entry-level opportunities out there for someone who'd like to work abroad (I realize I'd probably have to work locally for the first year or so first, that's totally reasonable), that don't require an insanely great track record? I'd like to find companies willing to give me a technical interview where I can demonstrate that my skills are equal to my bachelor holding, 3.5+ GPA peers! If you don't know any companies, that's fine, I'd just like advice on how to search more effectively for them! thanks in advance! =]




TL;DR:
- approx. 2.8 GPA
- completed all requirements, but don't hold a degree 
- want to work for an American company, but live across the globe
- how do I better search for companies that fit this bill?",1,2,False,default,,,,,

Anyone been in similar situation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2net4g/feeling_bad_about_current_edu_condition_anyone/,Iyyel,1416949994,"Hello /r/computerscience. I am sorry if a post like this normally would not fit here, but I'll try my luck.

I'm 18, currently in my last year of high school in Denmark. I failed my math exam (never really been good at it) in my 2nd year (total of 3 years) which is required to be able to study CS further in University. 

So, this means that I have to retake this, as individual math courses (which I am perfectly fine with) but I can't get the fact out of my head that I will use 1 more year on this. It really bugs me and annoys me a lot.

I have started to study math a lot at home, and I can already see that I have improved a lot (basic stuff so far, but going into the more relevant stuff)

So yeah, basically 2 days after I graduate I start on 1 intense math course for Math level B, then when that's finished I'm starting another for Math level A. (A is the required level.) and hopefully I will pass both of these exams.

So.. what I want to ask, have anyone else been through this? I mean, I kinda feel like a failure that I couldn't just beat it by the time in high school and be done with it. I feel like I am kind of wasting 1 year, even though I am not, but it is at least extending.

So what do you guys think? Is it okay, or am I lost without hope? :P

I hope everything makes sense. I'm sorry if it's difficult to understand.",1,4,False,self,,,,,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to be asking this and I apologize if it's not. In my current situation I work as a web developer and my employer is offering tuition reimbursement. I want to take advantage of that as much as possible to go back for a Masters degree in CSE but I'm unsure of what the best area of focus would be for someone who's work is almost entirely web &amp; mobile development. I know that industry experience in most cases trumps a Masters but I'm sure having both wouldn't hurt and I don't want to let the offer of tuition reimbursement go to waste. Has anyone here been in a similar situation / can anyone offer recommendations of masters programs that are geared towards people like me? I'm located in central Ohio and would prefer to attend courses IRL but wouldn't be entirely opposed to online school either. Again I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to be asking this! thanks,2,1,False,self,,,,,
