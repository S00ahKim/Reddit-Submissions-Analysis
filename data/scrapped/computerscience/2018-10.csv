I'd just like to know, how are your CS courses at your schools structured? Is it a traditional lecture setting? Or something unique that hasn't been done before? 

 I'm curious because a majority of the foundational classes like Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Engineering, etc all follow a flipped format. The courses are centered around a website that are made by the professor, and have modules that cover the different topics. These topics have ""lecture"" videos where teachers would explain the topic like a traditional lecture, and various readings and assignments that would have to be done before the class periods of the week. During class periods, it would be at the discretion of the professor. One of my classes just had a quick 10 minute quiz, and then we were released for the day if we didn't have any questions. One of my other classes had an in class assessment that would take up half of the class, and then we went over the solution to it in class. 

The main reason I'm curious is that I was talking with another friend of mine, and he pretty much freaked out when I told him how our classes were structured. There was the argument of getting the most of our tuition dollars, as he believed that learning the material outside of class is a waste of our money. I'm definitely glad to hear other opinions. 

The biggest problem that I do have with this course structure is that we have to put a lot of time outside of class to learn the material, and is/was pretty time consuming when we got to the more difficult topics. A lot of students are having trouble with Algorithms, as it is one of the most failed classes in the department, and also follows this flipped course structure. Some of my classmates have also expressed concern about the availability of the professor to ask questions about the topic, but it feels like we are provided with more than enough time in class when our professors open up the rest of the class for any questions that people have. 

I'd love to hear how all of your courses are structured, and any thoughts on the flipped course structure as well. ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm trying to create a presentation for my class over the levels of abstraction in computers ranging from all the way down to the transistor levels and up through logic gates, gated latches, simple RAM, ALUs, CPUs, and upwards. My presentation is basically going to show how different levels of complexity can be stacked on top of each other in order to make something as massively complex as a computer.

I'm looking for a program that I could use as a visual aid to show how these levels of complexity stack. For example, I might start with a CPU. When I zoom in on the CPU diagram, it would show the ALU, Control Unit, and maybe RAM and how they're connected. If I zoomed in on the RAM, it could show the latch matrices and how they're connected, and I could keep going until I eventually make it all the way back down to the transistor level. It would sort of be like a family tree in a weird way I guess.

Also, I was looking over posts about this problem on stackoverflow etc and learned that this same problem with cycles allowed is #P-complete (wiki says this class contains counting problems associated to the decision problems in NP, so I suppose polynomial time is no longer possible) Why is that? How does allowing cycles bring about this change?

**Where and how do I start understanding real problems and solutions in computer science. I am beginner in programming, other than basic things like installing softwares, games, operating systems and using softwares like Microsoft office or any photo/video editing software at beginner level I only know little things like how to write some simple code using concepts of the language, compile and run with it with commands like ""g++"" and writing simple HTML and CSS and running it in browser.**

I don't even know how does a .c , .cpp or .py file help us in actual problems in computer or what these files do or how do these files get converted into softwares/extensions.

Currently I am working to make a website with help of CMS Drupal. I don't know PHP. I don't understand the complex working of these softwares. So whenever I face any problem and I go to forums, they are of no use to me as the things they are talking about are out of league for me. I don't know which folder contains which file and how does it work. They talk about php.ini files and .htaccess files and I have no idea what these things are and what they do.

Same way I don't understand how plug-ins work in other softwares, how to I integrate and install them.

I don't understand what are those files with weird extensions things on GitHub and what do I do with them.

I don't know how to make a working extension from an object file even after writing a thousand line code.

So I need guidance to get out of this misery. How do I start understanding these kind of practical things, what do I need to do first and what next?

These things are not taught in colleges or schools, they only teach concepts of a language, they teach nothing about where and how do I use this knowledge.

I love computers and programming, but being in such a condition is very disappointing and there is nowhere to get answer to these questions.

It's really very disappointing when I want to integrate Google's AMP into my drupal website but I have no idea what the heck is drush, or what are php libraries or any other library on github or anywhere else and what are these different versions of these libraries and what do these things do.

I checked the courses for the program and it doesn't seem like they have any prerequisite classes to bring people up to speed. Maybe someone in the program can correct me if I'm wrong.

My goal is to be able to work at a Big 4 company so I feel it's very important to learn the material required to get into those companies. My undergrad was in Chemical Engineering at a prestigious university, I've taken MIT's intro to CS course on EdX, I have taken a Data Structures and Algorithms course through a local university and I have a Udacity nanodegree in Full-Stack Development. I got a job as a Software Engineer straight out of college at an automotive company and have been working there for 3 years to date. I've always felt like I was behind my peers so I have tried to basically learn all the material a bachelors in CS provides through these various programs. 

I have read here and on cscareerquestions that I will still have a major lack of understanding of CS fundamentals without the bachelors and that it is advised to get a second bachelors in CS to be able to keep up with my peers. Is that true or has my self-study caught me up? Would the masters at Georgia Tech get me this background and more?

*Pretty good grades (around a 3.5)
*Started my career at one of the big 4 accounting firms so I have a great resume to tout to admissions
*My twin brother decided to major in comp sci and loves his job/ is good at it
*Havent taken the GRE but I tend to be good at standardized testing, and Im good at excel which Ive heard is like dumbed down coding
*Im still young so I want to make my mind up before its too late

To give some background: I know nothing about computer science. I come from parents who barely know how to turn on a computer, and no one else in my family that has encouraged me to explore technology. If you were to ask me a year ago, I would he one of those people who would assume Java was short for javascript (heh). Not really knowing what to do for college I decided to give CS a try, and I honestly love it. 

Fast forward to today, I am now completing my second CS class. In my first class, I spent countless hours with tutors and spent countless hours outside of class practicing on Codeacademy or any other outside sources to brush up. My first CS professor was terrible but I made every effort to keep up with the rest of the people in class. And yet, I passed with a 72 percent. Here I am, in my second class doing the same things I was doing last semester: extreme amounts of work for seemingly little result. My discouragement comes from seeing everyone else in the class already knowing the material before its taught, and realizing that I take twice as long for me to understand the concepts.

so...... i propose

shouldnt we have a system, where it checks if the device is enrolled and if not, we can flick a switch that will prevent it from being enrolled? or if you cant turn it off, it should at least flash a message on your screen to which company or person or account it is enrolled into? and it should be built into the bios so it works on a bare level instead of OS preference.

Noel is creating a music quiz game.

The game stores a list of song names and their artist

(e.g. the band or solo artist name). The player needs to

try and guess the song name.

The game is played as follows:

 A random song name and artist are chosen.

 The artist and the first letter of each word in the song title

 The user has two chances to guess the name of the song.

 If the user guesses the answer correctly the first time they score 3 points. if the user guess it correctly the second time they score 1 point. The game repeats

the answer correctly the second time they score 1 point. The game repeats.

 The game ends when a player guesses the song name incorrectly the second time.

Only authorised players are allowed to play the game.

Where appropriate, input from the user should be validated.

Design, develop, test and evaluate a system that:

1. Allows a player to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that they are an

authorised player.

2. Stores a list of song names and artists in an external file.

3. Selects a song from the file, displaying the artist and the first letter of each word of the song title.

4. Allows the user up to two chances to guess the name of the song, stopping the game if they guess

a song incorrectly on the second chance.

5. If the guess is correct, add the points to the players score depending on the number of guesses.

6. Displays the number of points the player has when the game ends.

7. Stores the name of the player and their score in an external file.

8. Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.

So to my understanding recursion is a computer programming technique involving the use of a procedure, subroutine, function, or algorithm that calls itself. The definition seems pretty clear to me. However, when presented to me in a text of code, I can't seem to get how many times the code is being ran. For example: 

\#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int list\[4\];

int sum(int a\[\], int n) { 

if (n ==0) {

return a\[0\];

}

else { 

return a\[n\] + sum(a, n-1);

}

}

int main()   {

printf(""Enter four integers: "");

scanf(""%d %d %d %d"", &amp;list\[0\],&amp;list\[1\], &amp;list\[2\]. &amp;list\[3\]);

printf(""Their sum is: %d\\n"", sum(list, 3));

return 0;

}

So let's say the four integers that were entered are 3, 2, 6, 4 and their sum is 15. So the program is first read by main and if the integers are all 0 then the sum will be 0 else it will return the sum of the 4 integers. So to clarify, main would call sum once, and then the function sum in line 3 would be called and then the function in line 8 would be called as well? So this would be a total of sum() being called 3 times? I read something about needing to terminate the function... Can someone shed some light on this. 

Also, in this problem I am asked to draw a picture of the main program variables and the run-time stack just after the function is called for the third time. I looked up the definition of run time stacks and such and seem to understand the concept but how is one to draw three stack frames..",2,1,False,self,,,,,

I am planning to choose 'Distributed and Mobile Systems' specialization because I feel it is more practical (without lots of theory) and it has more scope for jobs. PS: These courses are taught using Java EE

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to know from experienced Computer Science individuals of reddit that whether my decision is correct or not? Also if you have to pick 12 courses out of 32 mentioned above which one would you pick? 

&amp;#x200B;

Please keep in mind my priority is just to hunt for a well paid job in future. I am not looking for answers saying ""follow your interest"" because i am pretty much open to all these fields of CS. And since CS evolves so much with time, i want to make sure I specialize in a correct field of CS

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in Advance.

Anyway, I was wondering (from a purely theoretical standpoint) if we were to achieve warp technology (the ability to bend space and or time around a localized area?) could this technology then be applied at a smaller scale for the sake of faster computer processing? Rather than being constrained by the speed of light in how fast information can travel between neural networks, could we instead warp that information instantaniously from 1 transistor to another to increase the information processing speed of a computer? I realize this technology is no where close to existing yet, and that scaling and duplicating warp fields for the sake of information processing would probably be even more complex than building a warp drive spaceship, but the idea intrigued me and I thought you all may be able to help shed some light on it from your professional experience.

What is the most memory efficient way to describe feature distribution of a group of objects, where each object has a number of e.g. population of a city where features are demographics like age, group, gender, religion, income level etc.

Storing each person's characteristics for say a million people in a database would result in 10 of megabytes of data, which is not possible for my use case due to performance considerations.

Simply storing percentage value of each demographic isn't an option either since you need to be able to answer intersectional questions like what percentage of the population is age 25-34 Hispanic males, who make between 20 and 35 thousand a year. I want to be able to run simulations on how economic factors like unemployment affects different demographic groups and their migration patterns between cities.

Is there a way to abstract city's population demographic data in a dataset say a few hundred bytes long while still staying fairly accurate (within a few percent) to the aforementioned complete representation?",10,1,False,self,,,,,

So I'm in the game engineering/ programming program in my school so it's not your traditional CS program but I have taken similar fundamental classes like calc 1-2, linear alg, discrete math, intro/ intermediate programming, data structures, assembly, and an intro course to algorithms and abstract data  types.  

I have 3 (possibly 4) open slots for classes in my last year of uni and I want them to be CS classes (I'm actually only 6 courses from getting a pure CS degree but can't fit it in.). I would appreciate advise and help on deciding on what classes I should take considering I'm aiming for games industry although I'm absolutely open to jobs at other tech companies as well, not just games. There are definitely some tech giants I'd like to work for some day

I'm already filling one slot with a class called analysis of algorithms. I think that is hands down the most important.

Here is a list of pure CS classes on the curriculum and what they cover:

 

OPERATING SYSTEMS:

process synchronization

Deadlocks

memory management

resource allocation

Scheduling

storage systems

study of several operating systems

&amp;#x200B;

COMPUTATIONAL MODELS:

Various representations for regular languages

context-free grammars

normal forms

simple parsing

pumping lemmas

Turing machines

Church-Turing thesis

intractable problems

P-NP question

&amp;#x200B;

COMPARATIVE LANGUAGES: 

This class has no description online but it's basically analyzing the differences between functional, imperative, OO programming, etc... as well as the different types of languages such as interpreted, compiled, etc... and things like that. The issue with this class that others have told me is that they use really old languages and it's something you can really teach yourself quickly. Also most classes we take cover part of this. I took an advanced programming class that covered some of these ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable mention: COMPILER DESIGN this class is no longer on the official curriculum as of three years ago (it is now an elective) but it was there when I started uni so I'm including it. This class teaches: 

compiler structure 

symbol tables 

regular expressions and languages

finite automata

lexical analysis 

context-free languages

LL

recursive descent

LALR, and LR parsing

attribute grammars as a model of syntax-directed translation 

use compiler building tools to construct a working compiler. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might be thinking, I have three slots so I can realistically take these three classes (assuming no time conflicts with my senior exit project) but there are also three other classes I found interesting but am debating if I should take them or not. Artificial Intelligence (pure cs class, this one isn't catered for games), Natural Language Processing, and Distributed Systems. I was hoping some of you more experienced folk could weigh in on this so that I don't completely fuck myself and make it harder for myself to find a job. As of now the only class I am for sure taking next quarter is analysis of algorithms so I have 2 possibly 3 more classes I can take.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

My experience : Proficient in Java, Python, and Matlab. Math experience includes Proof - Based linear algebra, multi variable calculus , elementary differential equations, fourier analysis. 

The problem: Ive been hired as an undergraduate researcher. My task was given to me and I am extremely overwhelmed. Ill be as general as possible to avoid getting in trouble. Basically, they had a vehicle that was controlled by some block-based programming language (like visual) and through a desktop (wirelessly). This was very inefficient. Their solution is the Nvidia Jetson, a microcomputer. This will be placed inside the vehicle. 

My job: I have to code a simulation that simulates the dynamics of the vehicle controllers before the controllers are used in the program (in python) . They gave me three textbooks to reference, and these are extremely mathematically heavy, in terms of dynamics, linear algebra, and what appears to be tensors which I have learned yet. 

I have no idea where to start! I wont be taking dynamics in school until a year from now. In terms of programming, I simply dont know where to begin. All programs Ive written before have been very objective, task, and need based. This is... so much freedom I suppose. I understand I have to implement the equations from these textbooks into this program, but the actual structure of the program is what Im failing to comprehend. 

Are there any resources for structuring code and how simulations can be run? Ive used python mainly for numerical analysis and plotting. Ive done simulations but very specific (for an aerospace class I had to compare several aircraft throttle velocities so I had a loop run through several functions and then after some matrix manipulation it would plot what I wanted using pyplot) but this seems eons above that program I did. 

I just dont know where to begin. They want a proposal in two days basically giving them an idea of what my gameplan is.  ",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I am an international student studying in Canada, about to graduate in two months.

So far I've learned apart from the mentioned courses is web programming using JS, PHP, MYSQL, other database stuff.

With a more technical software engineering program. I've also learned Linux administration (which I don't really remember a lot of not sure how can I get a job as an admin if I don't remember it).

Those who made more mistakes tend to learn more. Plus, there's no people who never made mistake. Remember this.

If you stuck in your code, it's okay. Take a break, make a drink, have some meal or just sleep on it (there are chance you'll be getting the solution in your dream). Remember that your need sugar and short break after hours of thinking and coding.

If you asked way too many stupid questions, it's okay. Asking stupid question doesn't mean that you're stupid. It's just you don't ""see"" it yet. Just like when you use microscope to look at a sample, things are blur at first and you keep on adjusting until you can see the sample. It's just that. Ask, ask until you ""see"" the answer.

If you asked a question and within a few second you suddenly ""see"" the answer. Congratulations! We call this Eureka moments. If you posted it somewhere, just answer your own question. Someone out there probably having the same trouble to ""see"" like you. (been there, done that, in one of C subreddit) And oh, programmers talks to rubber duck and there's nothing weird about it. Really.

If you feel that you can't do this because you think that you are falling behind, you are not smart enough, you are a slow learner, etc.. Ask yourself and THINK, WHY you do this? WHY do you learn this on the first place? Do you LOVE this? WHY do you love this? ASK, THINK, ANSWER and HOLD ON to that answer. 

If you think that you need to stop this because somebody told you that you are not cut for this, ALWAYS ask that person WHY and HOW do you improve yourself. If the person know enough, you'll be getting a tips on how to develop yourself even further. If the person doesn't answer your question, he/she probably doesn't know enough. Remember this when you encounter people who's trying to bring you down, a great person who is also a great programmer is definitely an excellent problem solver, hence there's always good input coming from him/her.

I hope while you're walking this journey, you'll find your love in doing this. Coding, problem solving, whatever. This is going to be a part of your life, let this be something you love doing most.

I have been asked in one of my PSETS a classic question on heaps: when adding n elements to an n-size heap, is there any difference in the time complexity between adding all the n elements at once, or adding them one at a time. 

My thought process: I understood adding all n elements at once as calling buildHeap which is O(n) and adding one at a time as doing n times of max-heapify (insert) which is O(logn). So while it might seem at first glance that adding n elements one at a time is O(nlogn), I feel like it should actually be O(n) for the same reasons why buildHeap is O(n) despite it simply being iterations of max-heapify. The reason briefly is that each element mostly do not have to traverse the logn levels of the heap (in fact, half of them at the leaves travel 0 distance), hence the complexity is actually O(n). Whilst I am satisfied with my reasoning, I see a lot of online responses such as this: [https://www.quora.com/If-we-have-a-binary-heap-of-n-elements-and-wish-to-insert-more-n-elements-not-necessarily-one-after-another-into-this-heap-what-would-be-the-total-time-required-for-this](https://www.quora.com/If-we-have-a-binary-heap-of-n-elements-and-wish-to-insert-more-n-elements-not-necessarily-one-after-another-into-this-heap-what-would-be-the-total-time-required-for-this)

I am a junior at University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Environmental Sciences. My main question is what motivates you all to study computer science. I really like the field and since I changed my major into CS I see the entire world differently. I am not majoring in CS for the high paying jobs, instead I want to work to create a more sustainable planet and fix issues like how a person dies every second from hunger while obesity is on the rise in America. I have ADHD and have basically cheated (gotten extensive help) my way to a college 3.3 GPA but have been staying up to around 4 am since middle/high school just to complete mundane homework assignments to reach where I am now. I was just diagnosed last year and maybe my medication is making me depressed but I consider myself smart although I make too many excuses when I fail. I consider myself hard-working but I experience extreme periods of laziness and distraction that eventually lead to chaos. I know that eventually I will figure out what I want to do with my life and probably look back at this time and laugh but for right now I just need the motivation to keep studying and learn the material for this exam I have in 6 and a half hours. I do consider changing my major but I do not want to be a quitter. I do take in count that it is unhealthy for me to compare myself to everyone and maybe it will just take me a few extra years to learn these hard ass concepts, but I am just really lost in general and any advice on how to complete my schoolwork and live a happier, more fulfilling life as a 20 year old would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Some days I feel like learning everything there is about the world and finding the meaning to life while helping others have the basic necessities in order to achieve happiness and some days I feel like dropping out and making a living being a full-time volunteer (which I think I could honestly find happiness in). Need advice/motivation/tips/resources/anything to just help me get through the day or I should say night since it is 3:10 am. Thank you and I realize this also might be too long for some people to read but I am confident at least 1 person will read this that can help me out.

To the people here who are currently working successfully in a programming career, what did you do to get better when you felt yourself falling behind? Is there a boot camp sort of thing you did?  Did finally landing that internship help boost your knowledge and self confidence as a programmer? Are there any resources you can recommend to help me?

I am a recent EE graduate (bachelors) who was been out in the work-force for about a year now. Towards the end of my EE curriculum I realized my true interest lies in programming and computer science. I was hired on after graduation into a management role where I do close to no engineering. I am troubleshooting electrical circuits, but only when the people I manage cant figure it out themselves, and even then its just very basic stuff. The rest of my time is devoted to management. In my free time from work (of which I have very little as this is an on-call position where I get every other weekend guaranteed off) I have been programming and digging into the various fields of programming (embedded design, web dev, etc). I have been working on small side projects that I found online, however, I think I would do much better in a formal environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am leaving this job as of next year. The horrendous hours combined with the fact that I am doing close to no engineering has burned me out. I want to dedicate the rest of that time to learning more about programming and comp sci in general.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you all is, if I were to apply for a masters in computer sci (I have a solid GPA, letters of recs, strong work experience, etc. worst case scenario I get into an average or below-average program) would I be up to speed having taken no CS courses in undergrad? Also, I do want to learn about comp sci as much as possible, starting from the fundamental level, so would I be selling my self short by just going into a masters program and skipping all the fundamental undergrad courses? Or, with enough initiative and time, can I close the gap somewhat reasonably between me and CS students who have taken those courses while I pursue my masters?  


I ask because I see a lot of EE bachelors to CS masters students, and a lot of people are recommending going that route instead of obtaining a second bachelors in CS. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: EE graduate in a management position who is truly interested in learning more about programming, computer science, and software development, wanting to know if a masters in CS or a second bachelors in CS is the better route.**

This wouldnt be the first time she changes majors as shes tried about 4 different things and I think its cool that shes trying to find what she likes but Im a little dumbfounded by her attitude. She says that now that shes a CS major once she graduates shes going to be making a lot of money and going to have a lot of free time to travel the world and buy a lot of stuff and stay in expensive places and basically just be living the dream. 
I tried to tell her that from my friends and my experience everything is not as easy as the internet makes it out to be when it comes to CS but shes absolutely sure shes going to get a very high paying job right out of 2 year college, become rich and have several vacation months a year. 
I kinda stopped giving her advice or talking about CS altogether with her because every time anything about CS is brought up she treats me like she knows the industry so well and shes already better at CS than I am (shes only taken beginners algebra and intro to personal computers and has never coded anything in her life ). While in the mean time Im freaking out cause I just want to learn as much as possible to have a job Im good at in a field I like when I graduate (really looking into graphics programming at the moment).

I'd like to be able to find a faster way of doing this so i can just round up all the packages I want to compile,  and let them all compile under the same set of compiler flags.

Normally, Id be really happy because I havent really had an internship before. However, this offer came at a bad time. Theyre giving me two weeks to either accept or decline the internship, but I havent had the opportunity to apply to most major companies (FAANG, for example).

Ive heard from other people that the company at which I received an offer is either a hit or a miss. Sometimes you can get a good project/team, but other times it can be really dull and bureaucratic.

I have two phone screens lined up for next week, and Ive already asked the companies to expedite the interview process for me. Im not sure how theyll go though; one is Facebook, and the other is for a major cloud storage company in Seattle. But to be honest, technical interviews are not my forte. I would say Im capable of solving problems around Leetcode medium difficulty.

I am thinking about declining the offer, but at the same time, Im worried that I wont get anything better. I havent had much practice with recruiting/technical interviews. This company is, at least, a big name in the industry. But if I accept, I might be stuck with a boring and stagnant internship.

TLDR; Im plagued with indecision and cant decide whether to accept an ill timed job offer that came VERY early in the recruiting cycle. Please help.

Now heres the predicament: I have looked at two instate colleges, plus talked to and researched their departments. At JMU, you can enter directly into the major and begin taking courses freshman year. This allows for more open credit hours to receive certificates, minors or even a double major. At VT, you have to enter through general engineering (difficult) and take a year of core engineering classes before being considered for a CS major. At which, then CS courses can be taken along with the mandatory engineering courses (which I dont have an interest in taking). Im torn between a specialized CS degree and a CS Engineering degree because VT is such a great school and their school of engineering is hard to get into and is known for its rigorous curriculum, while JMUs program would allow me to pursue so much more and advance way past just the core classes. These are not the only two schools I am applying to, but going forward I would like to know what I should be looking to get out of my major, or if a schools credibility outweighs a broad approach.

I am kind of nervous about this decision though.

I don't know the extent of the career options that exist, but as long as there are jobs out there that pay well and utilize my math/cs degree then I think it's worth it.

Has anyone here gone through a similar path in University? And if you did, or know people who have, what are the general GPA averages for these people?

Also, I don't mean to sound greedy, but is it financially beneficial to pursue a MSc and PhD in either CS or math? Because if I come out of that with a larger amount of debt only to earn what someone with an undergraduate degree would earn, then to me it doesn't sound worth while. For instance, I know that generally professors don't earn significantly more than someone with an undergraduate degree; I understand this can vary wildly for professors, though.

1 module seems fine. The other two seems disorganised and lacking in material to learn off of. The theory we are shown in class so far has been very simple, but its unclear about the exact direction of the modules. The material we are given to learn off isn't very clear and can sometimes be rather basic. The lecturer for one module has even strolled in late or not at all.

Compared with my engineering course its like night and day. That course was very well structured, had great material to learn of off and i always felt like i new the direction the course was going.

tl;dr I'm a CS noob and need some advice about program architecture

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:** I am currently working on a project by myself that allows human users to play a game of 20 questions with a computer. I am writing my program in Java using the Eclipse IDE. I am currently a sophomore in my CS degree program and have experience writing classes, methods, and doing all the other menial stuff that comes with intro CS classes. But now that I am trying to do a project entirely on my own, I need advice on how to properly and most efficiently store and access my information, as well as coming up with an interface so that the user can talk to the program (I will refer to '*the program'* as Agnes from now on. When I first started making the program, I was in the ER looking after my best friend, who had a very helpful and admittedly hot nurse named Agnes. He suggested I name the program after her, and thus here we are).

&amp;#x200B;

**The idea so far:** Currently, I have one class that is titled *Thinker*. This is the main class that is going to be calling and relying on the others to get stuff done. In this class are methods like *printMainMenu, createNewNoun (*I will talk more about this method later), and *learnNewUser*. This is the face of Agnes and what the user will talk to. Attached to this are two other classes called *Scroller* which *Thinker* uses to print scrolling text to the screen (think about how Pokemon text is displayed on the screen, revealing itself from left to right). *Scroller* only has two methods (*printScroll* and *printScrollFast)* so I am thinking about just dumping those methods inside *Thinker*. Finally, there is *CurrentUser*, which is a class that stores information about the current user and has some basic elementary return/set functions on instance variables. 

Those are all the classes that I have so far that help *Thinker* function and talk to the user. Next, in a seperate package, we have the *Noun* superclass and the three subclasses.  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Noun superclass is supposed to be a framework for my three sublcasses, *Person, Location, Thing*. Since Agnes is going to be playing 20 questions with a human, she has to be able to know certain qualities/attributes about certain things. This is where these classes come in, ***and where I need the most help.*** In order for Agnes to guess what thing a human might be thinking about, and to answer correctly if a human asks her a question, she has to be able to know things about these nouns. These classes serve as a place where all the information on a certain Object can be stored and accessed, when needed.   


Let's take a look at the *Person* class (as it is right now, in it's unfinished form):

`public class Person extends Noun {`

	`public int age;`

	`public int birthYear;`

	`public int deathYear;`

	`public String nationality;`

	`public String gender;`

	`public String occupation;`

	`public Person family[];`

	`public Location residence;`

	`public String religion;`

	`public String currentSchool;`

	`public String currentWork;`

	`public Location homeTown;`

	

	`public Person(String n) {`

		`super(n);`

	`}`

`}`

The plan is simple: initialize a bunch of instance variables, and when Agnes asks the user a question, reference that value. For instance, let's say that Agnes asks a human, ""*Was this person born in the year 1989"".* If the user says yes, Agnes will access the `birthYear` instance variable and determine if her most likely answer matches with the answer the human gave. If Agnes was thinking of Taylor Swift, then she would be confident that the human was thinking of Taylor Swift. If the human answers no, Agnes will have to rethink her answer and look for *Persons* in her memory that match that birthYear, *along with every other question that she has asked so far*.

Admittedly, I am completely lost if I am going about structuring my program the correct way. My code looks very.... blocky, and it kinds of meshes together. I am doing my best to comment my code, but even then, when I look back at previous work, I still find myself sometimes scratching my head and wondering what I was trying to do.

What I need from you, the wonderful people of r/computerscience is advice! I have never had to structure an entire program before my myself, and I know that there are probably a lot of time-computational analysis problems with my code that will slow down my program as well as horrible/improper reference techniques that will be hard to manage in the future. I want to be able to build a program that can be added on to and modified without sacrificing code readability and having to scrap entire methods/classes that just don't work anymore.

Hello everyone, 

First time posting here. I am hoping to get some advice on what colleges (Top 10, 20, 30, 40+ rankings)I can aim for based on my application (GPA, GRE, LOR's all described below). **I am hoping to apply for a Master in Computer Science this year and start in Fall 2019.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I am an **international student** who attended UC San Diego from 2012 -  2016. I graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering with a  Cumulative GPA of3.065 (just met the cut off!) but major GPA is **3.65**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to switch field from ChemicalEngineering to Computer science due to the research I did in my senior year. During my undergrad (and a  little bit after graduation whileI was looking for jobs), I was doing  research with one of my Chemical Engineering prof's in the  NanoEngineering dept at UC San Diego (for those of you who don't know,  the Nano and Chemical Engineering dept at UCSD is one dept and thus  prof's teach courses in both programs and are usually doing research  that applies topics from both fields). During this 9 month project, I  was working on writing C++ simulation code to model the diffusion of  nano-particles within polymers. Additionally, I also used a lot of  python and matlab for data analysis work. I had no prior experience in  programming before and taught myself C++ and python to conduct this  research with some assistance from my prof's Phd student. This project  concluded after 9 months since I found a Job and my professor got a better job at Duke University and moved to North Carolina. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once that project ended, I wanted to learn more about computer science  and explore programming more. Since then, I have taken classes in Java,  C, Assembly, Data Structures, Discrete Math (UCSD + community college  depending on availability of courses)I have completed all lower  division courses a CS Undergrad is expected to take and am starting to  take some upper div courses at UCSD this fall. **I have received A's in all but one of those Computer Science courses (which was a B+).**

 

Now, I do understand that since I am switching fields, some  universities may have me take some more undergrad courses in my first  semester/summer session which I am fine with. In fact, that is why I  want to go for a Masters program so I can get a formalized education  that covers all the fundamental topics in the field. I am also looking  to work on some sort of research project/Thesis during my masters so am looking for a 2 year program. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a list of my credentials so far 

* Graduated UCSD, BS Chemical Engineering: Cumulative GPA 3.065, Major GPA 3.65 	
* GRE Scores: Quant 166, Verbal 153 AWA 4.5 	
* LORs: All the people mentioned below confirmed that they will write me really **strong** letters of recommendation 		
   * Prof I did research with in my senior year for 9 months 			
   * while talking Computer science courses at community college, I got  to know one of my professors really well and he is now the dept chair of  Computer Science at the community college. I recently spoke with him  and he suggested I should apply to top 10 schools like UCBerkley, UCLA,  UCSD etc and will write me a LOR to help with that 			
   * My supv at work who I have been working with since Feb 2017. Since  joining my current company, I have successfully completed a lot of  projects independently and helped him foster strong working  relationships with other dept's which prior to that were falling apart  leading to no progress at work. My boss has also confirmed that he will  write a really strong letter of Rec 			
* I have received A's in all but one computer science course I took so  far (I have been taking these courses while working my current job full  time 40+hrs/wk 	

SO: with that in mind, what colleges would you recommend someone like me to apply for? I really like the program at Harvard Eng because it is a  two year MS that allows you to work on a project for the second year  under an adviser in the dept. I'm not sure how different admission's  committeeswill view my application since I am applying from a different  field from my Bachelors and that my cumulative GPA is on the lower end  for most top 15 schools in the nation. Any advice is highly appreciated!  I tried my best to provide all the information I thought would be  necessary to evaluatemy current situation but please let me know in the  comments if there's any more questions you have! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a point in my life where I'm not quite sure what I want to be doing with my life.  I've thought long and hard about my passions and interest while taking into consideration my career thus far.  I went to school in 2009 undecided before I found my way towards a Degree in Psychology with a Business Concentration alongside a Minor in Labor and Employment Relations, graduating around December of 2014.  I felt this would put me in line for a career in HR, as I sort of liked the idea of working with people, but not so much on a counseling sense.  


Fast forward a few years and I have worked with a small trucking company as an HR assistant primarily focusing on recruitment, then as a scientific recruiter for a large Staffing agency, and now I am a Talent Acquisition Specialist with a pharmaceutical company, and quite frankly I am not a fan of what I am doing anymore.  I am not passionate about HR, or  the pharmaceutical industry at all.  


Throughout my life, the one thing that has been consistent has been a love for video games.  I find the idea of being involved with the development of video games to be very exciting to me, and I think that perhaps pursuing a degree in CS  might be the way to go (not sure if it would make sense to go for a second Bachelors or a Masters, given my BS in Psychology). I feel like a degree in CS will allow for a great level of flexibility, should the Gaming industry not work out for whatever reason, but I know that as an Introverted individual I am currently working in a position that requires me to spend a lot of energy interacting with people over the phone for a large majority of my day. - I don't want to imply that I want to remove myself from all human interaction, if that makes sense.  I am an introvert working an extroverts job.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done a little bit of research and the salaries that I'm looking at seem to be in the general area that I would need in order to continue making loan payments while living on my own and managing other bills (I'm currently sitting at about $80,000/yr with my current job with enough to pay everything at a minimum with a little bit of play money, but not much).  I imagine that if I were to pull the trigger, it would defer my current loan payments until I finish my further studies, but I am also a bit scared of the idea of taking on more debt (went to school out of state at one of the most expensive schools because I made a huge financial decision at the age of 18 and did not properly consider the financial aspect).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping to get out of this, some sort of advice on whether or not it might make sense to pursue this route.  What you guys may see as potential options that I may not be seeing, what challenges to expect being a psych major going into CS, misconceptions, literally any piece of advice or info that you guys have to offer that will help steer me in the right direction.  


TL;DR Introvert with a long-standing passion for gaming, a BS in Psychology, and about 3.5 years of HR/Recruitment experience thinking it may be time to bite the bullet and go back to school at age 27 to pursue a computer science degree. Please tell me why I should or shouldn't, what I may not be thinking about, why I'm stupid for thinking about this or why I'm right to do so.

I'm also based out of NJ, if that is relevant, as whatever decision i do make, I hope to keep any continued education in state.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

Long story, won't get into it, but basically I've been on the CS track while working full time in an unrelated job for the past four years. There's been stops and starts, and the consequence is that even though I only have 6 credits left, I haven't actually done much coding at all in a few years now.

I'm pretty confident that I'm a good worker, a good communicator and a good learner but I feel like if I was put on the spot today in an interview I would have a really hard time looking like I've learned anything or can do anything related to CS. Because of the pressures of working and going to school while dealing with life generally, I have basically no portfolio of things I've coded, at least since very basic exercises way back when. The divide between what my piece of paper implies I know and what I feel like I actually know seems really wide.

Part of it feels like imposters syndrome, but I'm also convinced part of this anxiety is based in a real decay of my knowledge due to the non traditional nature of my schooling.

So the basic question is: what are the fundamentals I need to be able to demonstrate for an entry level position? Knowledge of data structures? Do I *have* to have a portfolio or github for an entry level position? I'm certainly not looking to get into highly competitive positions at one of the more prestigious companies in Seattle or the Bay, and I definitely plan to leverage what I am confident about, but certainly I'm sure there's fundamentals I need to not get laughed out of the door anywhere.",9,1,False,self,,,,,

Specifically, you will be using a cellular automata, with a Moore Neighborhood Configuration, to model geographic region, and a SIR model to model the health states of the populace. Your model should visually output how the regions population changes over time, the final S, I, R, V counts, the day of the outbreaks peak, and the day the outbreak ended.

Your program must provide the following functionality and adhere to the following constraints:

\-Allow the user to choose the file describing the initial setup of the simulation

\-The first line indicates the required number of infectious agents in a susceptible agents neighborhoodfor the susceptible agent to become infectious on the next day

The second line indicates how many days an agent remains infectious before it becomes recovered on the following day, i.e. if the infectious period is 2, then the agent becomes recovered after being infectious for 2 days

\-The third line indicates the display frequently for how frequently the region should be displayed in days

\-All subsequent lines will indicate the starting health states of the different agents in the region:

s: susceptible

i: infectious

r: recovered

v: vaccinated

\-Agents that are one square away from some other agent are considered to be in that agents neighborhood

\-Agents on the left and right boundaries of the region should be considered adjacent, i.e. the region is not a flatmap but more like a cylinder

\-An agentcan have one of four health states: susceptible, infectious, recovered, vaccinated

\-An agent can only move through the states as follows: S &gt; I &gt; R

\-A susceptible agent becomes infectious if they have threshold or greater number of infectious agents in their neighborhood on any given day

\-An infectious agent becomes recovered after infectious period number of days

\-Vaccinated agents are permanently vaccinated and cannot change states

\-The simulation should run untilthe number of infectious agents is 0, indicating the outbreak has ended

\- There should only be S, R, and/or V agents left over

\-The initial setup of the region represents the simulation at day 0

\-Your program should output the following:

\-The initial status of the region i.e. day 0

\-The status of the region every X days, where X is the display frequency from the input file

\-The final state of the region once the outbreak has ended, i.e. the first day that there are 0 infectiousagents

\-The final counts of the number of susceptible, infectious, recovered, and vaccinated agents once the outbreak has ended, i.e. the first day that there are 0 infectious agents

\-The day the outbreak ended

\-The first day of the outbreaks peak in terms of number of infectious agents, i.e. the firstday with the highest count of infectious agents

I am joining a University in the Fall of 2019. The thing that irritates me is (actually not me, its my dad) Should I major in CSE?

See I have loved computers forever now, and I love coding. I am all this tech guy thinking about artificial intelligence and stuffs. In conclusion, I see COMPUTERS to be our future and an evergreen career path to choose.

But the same is not for my dad, Somebody recently told him CSE does not have a future (which I literally laugh at). Apparently this friend of his did CSE during the recession period  (that's like 2000's) and he suffered to get a job, after which he did a MBA or some business  stuff. Now my dad is hung on this ""COMPUTER SCIENCE IS STUPID COURSE AND DOESNT HAVE A JOB MARKET"" or something like that, and he wont let me do COMPUTER SCIENCE, which is sooo freeeking frustrating.

Honestly I wanna do CSE, I am not sure how to convince my dad since he is a man hard to convince.

I don't delve into the compiler standard, name mangling and other advanced topic regarding C++ compilers. Assume the same C++ compiler.

1. A compiled program are bunch of binary instructions for CPU. so once the code are loaded onto the memory and CPU is instructed to read from the starting address of that chunk of the memory, the CPU will carry out the rest. So... why doesn't an exe file work on linux, or not all win7 exe works for win10? Clearly OS is involved in resource management and multiprocessing, so a compile program must somehow talks to the OS to request resource and attention. How exactly?
2. binary instructions for CPU is very specific. it's like ""load this number to the 10th float register, add to the 11th float register, and the result will be put in the 2nd memory address register, and then transfer whatever in the 2nd memory address register to the system memory"". So, all AMD and INTEL cpus within the past 10 years, however many cores, hyperthreading or not, can understand the same set of binary instructions?

In actual computer tech circles, I'm actually pretty low down the chain. I do work as a freelance computer technician through a company, I get to choose the work I do, and it always ends up being way easier than the description suggests when I'm actually presented with the work. Regardless, computers are what I know best, and I want to know them better to make it my career.

&amp;#x200B;

School, degree, certification expenses will all be covered, I can study multiple things even, I just need to figure out what really vibes with me. The thing that seems to be sitting at the very top of my mind is a career in ethical hacking. I really like the idea, I would like to work my way up to it. I asked a friend, and he told me I need to study CISSP. Looked it up, seems to be right. The thing is, I'm afraid of opening up the textbook and not understanding a damn word. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once upon a time, I made the hyper-liberal decision to attend college to study environmental science, cuz I wanted to save the world lol. 4 weeks in to the classes, the textbooks started talking about things that I couldn't comprehend for the life of me, and the lack of explanation in the textbooks seemed to imply that anyone following this field of study already understands it. Same thing happened when my dad signed me up for a certification course for CCNA like 4 years ago because he really wanted me to have a high-paying job in something computer related, and I understood so little that I tried my best to ask relevant questions to help me understand, only to have every question rejected by the teacher because ""we don't have enough time to go into all that"", literally every question, I was so discouraged of course I dropped out, there was no way I was going to pass the test.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to avoid these situations now. I need to start from what I know and work my way up. I may even find something along the way that suits me better than ethical hacking, but I'm not quite sure where my talents could take me that isn't typical IT office space work (this is me hoping that ethical hackers have more options than office space IT). Basically I would like to avoid working in a cubicle as much as possible, my fingers are crossed that this goal is at all feasible.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the summary of my skill: I am efficient as hell in utilizing and modifying Windows OS. Same with Android, but I'm definitely better on Windows computers. I've solved so many computer hardware and software issues on all my desktops and laptops that I definitely know enough to freelance comfortably at the moment. I can build a desktop computer and swap hardware. I imagine I'd be really good at a job of simply diagnosing and fixing hardware/software/OS related issues, if there is a job for that that can be done outside office cubicle IT and freelance. My HTML coding knowledge goes about as far as whatever it took to edit my MySpace profile a decade ago, I would honestly love to learn code but I currently don't believe I have the patience, maybe later on. (Please tell me if ethical hacking requires the same level of coding knowledge as required in HTML, then I'll probably just have to bite that bullet and learn me some code)

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this information, what career would you say would best suit me? How far away am I from a career in ethical hacking? What major/certification would be best for me to start studying? I've been under the impression for a while that CompTIA A+ is the place to start, is this correct? Anything else similar to it that I should also seek maybe during or immediately after, and then what would my next steps be after to reach an ultimate career goal?

How could I obtain such metrics? In short, I need to know if someone cracked a clue. Bonus point if I can see how many cracked it (++ if I can identify who) and when they were accessed.

I do not have any budget on this (so no website buying), I cannot install anything on the computers but I do have access to a local network. Also, 50% at least of the potential players are savvy with using git so this opens some doors.

Recently, I have taken an interest in performing combinatorial analysis for the game of 21 (blackjack) and attempted to use my AMD APU to try and thread the program via the 4 cores on chip. Generating the proper strategy and expectations has proven to be a success, as well as taking very few seconds (around 12) to compute the optimal strategy for any given rule(s) and deck composition. However, when it comes to compute other deck compositions, it would take 12.63 years to compute all deck states...for a single deck. So, another approach would be to simulate a select limit of random deck subsets via a monte carlo method. This will work! However, the 12 seconds per analysis is a *huge* bottleneck! Randomly selecting just 10E6 subsets would take around 139 days. Not feasible with my current CPU, even with threading.


*A primer on how I am analysing the strategy chart(s):*

1.) I first start by computing what the overall expectation for standing is by taking a set of n_cards for the player and enumerating all possible dealer hand sets. I compare the outcome of each specific dealer total against the current hand total of the player hand.

2.) I then compute the hitting expectation by taking a player hand set {23} and finding matching hand sets for x:2-&gt;A, so that we can compute the weighed expectation of hitting to {232}, {233}, {234}, ...,{23A}. We do this by computing all hard 21's first, then hard 20's...down to all hard 12's; then do the same by computing hitting all soft 21's to soft 13's; then compute all hard 11's to hard 5; and finally, we compute hitting all pair cards ({22}, {33}, ..., {TT}, {AA}.)

3.) Doubling is the same as hitting, except we only draw one card and stand for any 2_card player hand. We return the expectation of drawing to a specific 3_card hand and multiply the expectation by 2 times the probability of that drawn card.

4.) For splitting, we will take steps 1.) to 3.), we will repeat 1-&gt;3 up to 11 times. Why? We are computing the expectation of splitting to a new hand by removing the rank for which we are splitting. (For example: We want to split {22}. We will compute standing, hitting, doubling for a given deck subset, minus one of the ranks we are splitting. If we originally split {22} for a deck subset of {4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 16 4: 2-A} or {3 1 4 3 4 4 3 1 14 3: 2-A}, our new subsets would be {3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 16 4: 2-A} or {2 1 4 3 4 4 3 1 14 3: 2-A}.)

5.) After all of this, we should get back out optimal strategy with respect to the computed expectation(s) for each possible decision for each player hand.


Now, I have been looking into seeing if there is a quicker way of analysing the strategy using either GPGPU or FPGA/ASIC. I first looked at GPU programming as a possible route, however, I am not sure if it is feasible as there are 3072 unique player hand states, meaning there will be 3072 unique data structures to compute for standing, hitting, doubling, and splitting.


With all this said, I was hopping there was a way to perform some form of simultaneous processing, where the state of each expectation changes dependent on the change in the rules and/or the deck state. That is, rather than recompute each expectation for every change in rules/deck_state, there would be some dependence on the output for each data point. For example: We have three data points named A, B, and C. We also have state data {1 2 3}. For each data point, there is a state equation that we posses:


A = data[0]

B = A + data[1]

C = B +data[2]


Under serial processing, we would evaluate A first for 1, B for 2 plus A, and C for 3 plus B. If we change data to be {2 2 3}, then A would be 2, B would be 4, and C would be 7. Under serial processing, this would take several cycles per data point, for each data point. Is there a method under FPGA where the change in state is instantaneous? That is if we change any point of data, that A, B, and C will change after data changes, simultaneously?


If not, what benefits does FPGA/GPGPU processing offer to a programmer who wants to accurately and quickly compute large volumes of floating point data in a near instant? Basically, is there a way to rapidly compute the optimal strategy of a blackjack game that is faster than multi-threaded CPU processing that is not 12 seconds long?

Hello, friends. I would like to tell you a story to beat all stories. There once was a hobbit, who lived in a hole and this is a retelling of a very old story, or allegory, as I hope you will contact us afterwards, of how he got out of the cave he made for himself.  
 

The Plan

We are going to monopolize a series of decentralized crypto currency networks, more specifically utility token networks, that currently exist in a state of simultaneously being over valued, and under valued, at the same time. This result was not expected at the outset of the creation of the projects that we are going to explore, but I assure you, this is the case. It is very possible that were looking at the cutting edge of computer science  potentially, we are looking at a rip in the space-time continuum  but what is most definite is that were looking at an arbitrage opportunity of historic significance. It is also potentially going to be the largest robbery perpetrated against the most deserving victims, resulting in the most benefit for the most people since Robin Hood took Prince Johns last shilling.  
 

What Im going to describe is a little bit classical investing, a little bit of The Matrix, and a little bit Oceans 11. Its also going to be a little bit Darwinist, a little bit Wolf of Wall Street, and very self-serving all the way to the end of it, where it becomes the most beautiful gift humanity ever gave to itself. But the good part, at the very end, only happens if we can trust each other to break an unbreakable trustless system. And after were done doing that, were going to have to do something that is even more unheard of in the study of history, and a thing commonly only found in fantasy. What were going to try to create is the most similar to 9/11, in the sense that it is the opposite of it. Our data has found, through the study of human history, that a small group of people sufficiently funded with a relatively small sum of money are capable of taking that money, and turning it into a catalyst that results in a historic event that shapes the future for many years to come. The common term for this is a catastrophe, or cataclysmic event.  
 

But the thesis of this computer science experiment that were already undertaking, but seek the support of in reaching out to you, is that we can create the opposite of a catastrophe. The term for this was coined first by JRR Tolkien  he referred to this even as a eucatastrophe or a a sudden and favorable resolution of events in a story but perhaps is most commonly known to the public as a happy ending  he describes this event in the The Lord of the Rings, when Frodo drops the ring into Mount Doom.  
 

I believe it is possible to dream a happy ending into existence using computer logic and the greed of speculation about the future, rather than the real world investing in it that our market system was supposed to provide - but this is how the story begins.

Orientation

The first crypto currency, Bitcoin, is only 8 years old, and at the end of this document, you will likely understand more about crypto currency than the people who created the first one. This is possible because it is an entire sector that has been more pushed forward by dreamers and curious minds than it has been developed by venture capital interests.   
 

Groups that demand immediate and consistent profitable returns, and measure those returns against the results of other ventures that have been agreed on to be the benchmark of success would suggest that double digit annual returns are unsustainable but its best to enjoy them while it lasts. But, we have found, using crypto currencies, that the returns traditional investing earn in a year can be gained in a day, when occupying enough market share of a market. We do this using automation to interact with the world markets in a specific way that provides liquidity and stability in markets that are traditionally the most volatile in the world. As the price moves, we tax that movement, and extract value for ourselves by way of profits from trading, and create value for the broader ecosystem in the form of price support, thus preventing the market from bottoming out (or at least falling slower because of our participation), as well as creating price stability during market highs, allowing people with non-automated trading systems to capitalize on longer periods of positive growth without missing the chance to sell while the market is up.  
 

While our automation has sufficient funds to provide liquidity in these exchanges, we are day over day getting between 100 and 300 bps/day in earnings. To continue providing liquidity to these markets when our own reserves of coins are low, we are using a decentralized smart contract that provides credit in exchange for collateral and interest on the resources lent. By using this method, we are able to keep liquidity in these markets, and our trading system maximally effective, regardless of price movement or our own holdings of coins, and the interest on renting the coins to do it is almost negligible.  
 

Furthermore, these markets are utility tokens exchanges. That is to say, these tokens only represent resources a computer network should allocate to a user based on the size of his coin holdings. There are no traditional metrics to evaluate these coins and their value, as the market price of them is simply the intersection of supply and demand on a moment to moment basis as determined by a decentralized network of users who have or want them. In short, they will never be so cheap that the price of the desk the computers sit on is greater than the price of owning a stake in that desk, because they do not represent ownership of that desk at all. Likewise, when the price is astronomically high, it can never be deemed too high, because the network it represents resource allocation of does not now, nor ever will be profitable or unprofitable. It simply will continue to be there, and allow you to interact with it, based on if you have coins for that network and how many. It is more important to understand that these coins are NOT SECURITIES than it is to understand what those coins are at all.   
 

Going forward, a great deal of this plan and discussion will be metaphor and perhaps come across as hyperbole. The reason for this is because the systems that we are talking about are simply shuffling zeroes and ones to each other, and if I gave you the math for what is going to happen expressed in those terms, there are few or no minds on the planet that could follow the thread of this discussion in those terms at all in the context of how much data the network has if you tried to aggregate it.  
 

The very people who create and code these networks do not even interact with them on these terms of zeroes and ones, but rather in a coding language. In this sense, even the people coding these systems are only using metaphor by interacting using the programming languages that they do. And so, in order to make this slightly less boring, and more readable, I hope you will forgive the use of language that is more descriptive than it is literal, but what is most important to remember along the way is that nothing about what is being described is a crime as the Security Exchange Commission would see it, because none of these things are securities at all.  
 

What is the Bitcoin Network?  
 

The first bitcoin was created 8 years ago as a result of a cryptographic computer science experiment in which a group of people who referred to themselves as the cryptopunks sought to create a decentralized and censorship resistant network that could keep a ledger of the location of all the bitcoins and their ownership in real time without the need for any 3rd party involvement or consent.  
 

The entity attributed with the creation of Bitcoin, and the blockchain technology is known only as Satoshi Nakamoto which is commonly agreed to be a pseudonym for a person or group of persons. No one has heard from Satoshi Nakamoto since he disappeared after a colleague on the Bitcoin team sent him an email saying that the CIA had reached out to him, and wanted to talk about their research.  
 

The security of the blockchain is provided through proof of work in which a network of computers around the planet attempt to use brute for number crunching to find the sum of the interior angles of a triangle in non-Euclidean geometry based on 3 points on a sphere. The interior angle of that triangle are unpredictable, because unlike in traditional geometry where the sum of the angles is always 180 degrees, when 3 points on a triangle are placed on a sphere the range can fall anywhere above 180 degrees, but not equal to it, and as high as or equal to 540 degrees. To perhaps exemplify how a triangle can have 540 degrees, consider that if you and 2 friends formed a straight line on earth, that the interior angle between each of you is 180 degrees, and there are 3 of you, and the definition of a triangle is 3 points on any given plane, thus the angle of the triangle you formed when standing in a line is 540 degrees, and cannot be any greater. The interior angle of the previous block in the chain is the determining factor in the placement of the next 3 points to be solved for in the following. The first machine to solve the question of How many degrees are inside this triangle? by guessing is given the privilege of taking the highest bidders for his time from the market, and performing the protocols desired by way of recording changes to the block chain, while other participants in the system are prevented from recording in this way. As the next block cannot be solved without knowing the solution to the present one, the system is trustless and immutable  it cannot be tampered with, and is governed only by math, with no gate keepers.  
 

What is the Ethereum Network?

The Ethereum Network, or Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a set of computer protocols with a heavy emphasis on determinism as the backbone it was built on. These protocols determine the outcome of an interaction with the blockchain, and the creation of an ever-evolving record of the location and allocation of the resources these systems are built to account for. 

Ethereum also has the ability for users to interact and create decentralized smart contracts which serve to govern the ownership and allocation of coins as agreed upon by two parties based upon outcomes that dont require a 3rd party to execute.  Metaphorically, you can think of this as an ATM, where no bank teller interacts with you, but rather a user only interacts with a machine that allows you to deposit money in your savings account, and borrow on a credit card with a limit proportional to your savings account. You could also think of it as a dooms-day device, that is going to act the way its going to act with no way to stop it once events are put in motion.   
 

Other users of the smart contract can see how you have interacted with it because the blockchain is public and visible to the world, and if they would like, can accept the terms of that agreement, and at no time can anyone other than each of the individual users control what the users are doing. In short, there are no gatekeepers in Ethereum. There is only what exists in the network by way of code, and the infinite room to put it there if you would like to and are willing to pay for the electricity needed to carve it into existence and be maintained for the rest of time, but this is a one time payment which costs less than your credit card skims from starbucks when you buy a coffee.

What is staking?  
 

Staking is an idea seeking to resolve the problem of energy waste that is seen in proof of work. The problem with proof of work is that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to run the level of computation that crypto networks currently use, and all but 1 of those computations actually resulted in change at all. To solve this problem, a staking system could be put in place in which rather than randomly guessing as we have been, a user would put up collateral in order to act as verification entity, where the trust of that individuals word was determined by how large of a stake that individual might have. Anyone who felt that the outcome of an event in the blockchain was being mis-reported could put a larger stake up or proportion thereof, and which ever outcome is the most heavily staked by the user base would be deemed the true outcome, because there is seemingly no value is attempting to stake a lie or untruth if a greater consensus could be made, as the economic incentive is to side with the truth than the lie.  
 

What is Augur? What is REP?  
 

Augur is a decentralized prediction market platform. The limits for what kind of market can be made is infinite, and censorship proof, as a result of being hosted on the Ethereum Network. Users stake their REP, short for Reputation, in order to report the resolution of market outcomes. Because Ethereum has no way of drawing information from the outside world without the outside world participating with it intentionally, this hurdle is overcome by allowing users to report themselves. In exchange for doing this reporting work, people who hold REP are given a small amount of the volume of those markets (as set by the market creators) and these dividends are paid in Ether (ETH).  
 

So an example of what kind of market could be found within Augur is Who will win the game this weekend between the Eagles and Packers? or Who is going to win the next election? or Will the rainfall this year in Chicago exceed 22 inches? or even When will mankind cure death?. There is no approval process in creating a market, only a loose form users must stick to, and the resource requirements to maintain that market on the blockchain  again, infinitely, for the rest of time if desired, in exchange for a one time payment in the present to cover the cost of electricity to manifest your will or curiosity on the network.  
 

In the time between the creation and resolution of these markets, users can see the likelihood of the outcome of any given result represented by the confidence in that result numerically using Ether and the volume staking one outcome or another. This type of prediction oracle is called The wisdom of the crowd which says that it is more accurate to ask the crowd than any one person for their opinion of that outcome, as no one person has all the information on the system in question.  
 

Computer Science and the Space-Time Continuum  
 

We live in an uncertain time. In the very real world we live in people in our country are arming themselves against their neighbors. Gun sales at record highs. Racial tension. What would happen if my band of pirates staked 1,000,000 ETH in a prediction market paying 100,000:1 that we will all love each other and not have a race war. Do you think people who could see that uncensorable prediction market would feel more at ease, and perhaps not buy a gun, or fear their neighbor less? Do you think if we were correct about that prediction market that we would have gotten lucky, or would we have believed our own prediction into existence and created a situation where we are not only staking the future, but creating it by using greed as the fuel? If a person thought in spite of my band of misfits prediction market that there still would be a race war this year, do you think that they would spend 1,000 dollars on an AR-15 to feel safer, or stake the opposite position with those funds in that market against my declaration of peace, and rather have the keys to a wallet that can be accessed anywhere in the world with 100,000,000 dollars to buy their safety if they are ever living in a world where a gun might help?

Considering that my band of misfits doesnt need the money, nearly so much as we need a better safer world, and will have created an incentive for you to feel safer, and not buy a gun either way - do you think the future that comes to be was lucky prediction? Or market manipulation?

Would you rather have us manipulate that market? Or not?

What do you think would happen in the tech industry if we took the position that the singularity was going to happen in 2029 or not going to happen in 2028, and we staked 1 billion dollars on it happening accordingly. We would have created an incentive in a futures market for someone to take the opposite side of our action, and try to do it faster. If the singularity happened in 2028 because we took so much stupid beanie baby money and proclaimed that it was going to happen in 2029 - what just happened there? Did the winner of that bet in our futures market get lucky? Or did we just create a mechanism for greed to accelerate the end of human mortality because we said it would happen with money by staking the position that it wouldnt? What do you think would happen if we staked the temperature of the earth with that money that nearly destroyed it? What would happen if we staked the race to mars, or the moon? What if your opportunity was that no one had gone to the moon yet this year, and we had created a way to profit by just going to check that its still there? We would have created a global decentralized market for the challenges that we face as a species, and opportunity to optimize ourselves without needing permission to be the best versions we can be. All of these markets can be crowd funded into eternity for visas cut of your cup of coffee, and would grow infinitely from the failure of the previous moment in time until our disappointment and greed merge to collapse the infinite possibility of time and space, thus dreaming a better world into existence using man kinds propensity for greed, and proven track record of being disappointing.  
 

We believe that this will potentially cause dramatic harm to the crypto economy, and broader economy as we know if for a short time. We believe our system is capable of growing the coins in our custody at a rate well above 1.5% per day, because we are currently growing at 3% per day. The power of exponential growth is significant. Likely, more than you can imagine. Consider than 1 dollar today will be 38 next year at 1% growth per day. It will be over 50 at 1.1%, and at 3% growth per day, 1 dollar becomes almost 50,000 in a year. This is the data that assures me that I dont really need your help, only would like it. Based on the coins in our custody now, and our present rate of growth and innovation, our projections put us at owning the bulk of coins in circulation in the next 19 years. But  if we were to push that timeline even a little bit, by increasing that pile of coins in the present, we accelerate the timeline exponentially. And if we increase the resources in our control by quite a bit we believe that we will accomplish our goal in the next 2 years.  
 

The Goal  
 

When our Computer Science Appreciation Club has accumulated enough of the coins in the network, and wrung every bit of value that exists only as a result of greed and speculation by those who have no desire to ever use these networks, we are going to do another magic trick.   
 

In addition to accelerating human accomplishment with the power of hope, dreams, and greed. Were going to take all or some of the coins in our control, and were going to collateralize them in a money market very much like the one we are currently using to impose our will on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. We are going to issue a new coin, backed by all the coins we had accumulated previously to create a stable, immutable, uncontrollable, uncensorable, globally available currency. Then, were going to send the keys of an individual wallet address to every man woman and child on the planet with some of that coin in it. And we are going to put some more of that coin in it every day. So that at no point, will there be a day where someone can say they did not have two nickels to rub together. We believe no one will ever say they didnt have two hundred dollar bills together, when we are successful, ever again.  
 

But this is not a selfless act by my merry band of misfits and pirates. Quite the contrary. We believe that nearly everyone on the planet that we interact with is disappointing. That the chimpanzee meat computer of our present hardware is ill suited to optimizing for the future in the present paradigm. We are giving away this money at that point, so that everyone can stop being such a disappointment to us. We are tired of the experience where an hourly employee gives us bad customer service because they are not paid enough to put up with our bullshit. We hope to make a world where people interact with each other because they want to, not because they have to. We are going to be filthy rich, when we are successful, or for that matter if we fail, my band of misfits. And we are worried when that happens about how long before it is that men with guns come for what is ours. We dont know if these men with guns will come from the governments of the world, or from those envying what we have.  
 

We seek to become the golden goose of the planet, and in return we would like to not fear slaughter while we try this. In this arrangement, we look only for your cooperation, and in return, will share an infinite sum of golden eggs with you, and everyone you know. And when we do this, we will not fear the envy of our neighbors, nor the governments who command the armies it would take to stop us. We will protect the people from their governments, and themselves. And in time, we hope the governments will likewise protect us from their people, though letting go of power will no doubt be hard to swallow. The only thing that can stop us from doing this is if someone buys the coins that give us power from us. And in doing so, would give us the wealth we need to accomplish these things in the real world. If we are not bought out, we will accumulate enough coins in the Ethereum Network that we can impose our will upon it, until we can deliver on our promises of a better world because we control it completely.  
 

In these sense, we have already won. A better world is already here, as certainly as we have already dreamed the path to it. We plan on out-staking a better world into existence, regardless of what the future currently holds in store for us now. In short, we are going to lie to an unbreakable trustless system until it births the world were lying about into the realm of what is real. In shorter, we are going to believe our bullshit more than you cannot believe it, until we have delivered what we promised.

The Problem

The problem with growing as fast as the control our Computer Science Appreciation Club is over the Ethereum Network is that its too fast. Were growing our sum of coins so fast, that to an outside observer you might think we were a hedge fund of some sort at best. But at worst, you might think we were a criminal enterprise. Legitimate enterprises dont grow at 1% or more daily infinitely, but we do. And if you were not as educated as you are, now, at this point in reading this, when you saw how rich we were, you might think someone should try to stop it. We would ask, for your sake, and our own, that you dont  we dont need you to do anything, and the world is going to get better from here.  
 

The problem is that if we were a hedge fund, which we arent, then we would need to file paperwork to take control of other peoples funds. If these were securities, the acts we were going to commit would be best exemplified in Wolf of Wall Street, but were going to do it on a much greater scale with computers. Lucky for us, these coins are not securities, they are less regulated than the gold in World of Warcraft you can buy with your credit card, or the skins in League of Legends. These coins are worth nothing, and everything, at the same time.   
 

But the bigger problem, is that I cannot stop you from sending money to my hedge fund when/if you sent ether to my wallet address where we are running this experiment. Its a decentralized system, and its open source, and completely public, if we tried to hide it would only work for so long until an internet detective found it. If someone was to find the address of our computer science appreciation club, we could not stop them from sending coins there. But, since we cannot stop them, we would like them not to waste their time looking  the address is this on the Ethereum Network:  
 

0xCDF449b5c9Bd2A725319163C3E7f2d7222c4d8c9  
 

We have the best legal minds on the planet trying to solve this puzzle with us, and well get the paperwork straight soon  if the Winklevoss Twins dont think its a conflict of interest.  
 

If reading this letter, you find your brain to be so tickled by it - that regardless of the forces that seek to keep us from accumulating enough resources to do this in two years, you wish to believe in it more than those opposing forces, and in doing so stake your opinion about what the future you are going to live will be, I would not ask you to waste a moment of your life looking for us, because we are here to be found. We cannot count our coins as fast as they grow, but our collective efforts will be carved into the eternal stone of the Ethereum network, and I promise were going to give back all of these coins to the world, when were done fixing a few things.  
 

But there is another problem, and its far worse than making money too fast - just as we are going to bet that no one goes to the moon until someone does every year forever just for fun, it is possible to bet on the absence of a war until a war exists because your certainty manifests it into being to spite you. The same market we hope to keep the world at peace, and put their fears to rest from the uncertainty of where were going next is also a mechanism to game our system, and bet on a war happening to get rich. But there is a way to stop this  were going to accumulate the majority of the REP tokens, and if we have 51% of the circulation, if someone tries to beat us at our own game and bring a war into existence  then we would be able to stop the unstoppable machine from making them rich. We will also have the wallet addresses of the people who needed the insurance policy we are going to unfairly deny, to make them whole, and they would have neighbors with means to support them while we unfucked the pooch. We would have a failsafe to prevent a war from coming to be, because we are so sure there will not be one that it might happen. This, above all else, will back the new currency we are going to issue to the planet. Our new currency will not be backed by gold, or equity, or faith in a flawed system. It we be backed by trust of mankind invested back into itself that we will not go back to a system that will tolerate scarcity, or war, or hunger in exchange for the certainty of the absence of these things. No one will need to ask what is in our vault, or need to audit it, until the day comes where maybe someone will try to beat us at our own game. If that happens  were going to need the world to give back the currency we gave it as our collective reward for our cooperation, to free the tool we need to stop violent men from becoming rich men at the cost of a world without poverty, because it will be the immutable collateral backing the currency we are going to give you.  
 

As a disclaimer, Im not somebody who has the background you might think someone should have for this  Im just a hobbit. Im not a hedge fund manager, or a computer science engineer. I raise pigs, and ducks, and geese that need some help, too  because we arent eating them enough to keep them existing in our food supply. It is a more fun paradox than this, and I get to solve that one by cooking dinner for some friends, and telling stories when this adventure is over. It feels a little like The Shire there, where Ive been hiding melting my ego with psychedelics in the sunshine while salting pork, and listening to podcasts from Rogan, Duncan, Bart Chystler, Tom and Krista, some tinfoil hat guys, and seeing how abundant a life can be given only a little bit of hopium and room for creativity, and Im eager to get there and back, again. I very much look forward to seeing what were all capable of, when were given a chance. But were going to have to put a little faith in a system that doesnt need faith to operate - so that we can fix a different system that has never needed it more. I think were going to be able to do that for us all, but I might very well be lying to you, and not know it yet  at least, thats the plan.  
 

Ironically, salting pork is what brought me to understand what is worth something, and what isnt. When they used to talk about a salary or say that you were worth your salt was because all that you needed to live was enough salt to keep your meat from rotting when you cured it into bacon and hams at the end of the season. The salts value wasnt while it was in the bag, it was while it was preserving your food when times were hard and things were scarce. In the modern time, a salary is what gets bigger when a emloyer make his employees poorer. Now, we have made laws to respect each other by race and religion and where who-sticks-what-where, but made it legal and standard to reduce someones value to an integer value of currency per moment in time, and the currency is backed by oppression of man-against-man (chicks, too). To increase your integer value per moment in time, that gain must come from another? Are we the only people who think this is inherently disrespectful to your fellow man even if you dont call him a fag to his face like we used to when we were kids and it meant I love you, man  but Im too afraid of being called gay to say it.  
 

In the present what is perhaps the most scarce of all, are places where you are free to be an animal at all, let alone places where you are free to be the lion you might be and not know it. We are so caught up in having agreed upon contracts so that we dont get fucked, that we dont have trust or honor that is held between lions when the zebra meat is abundant and they eat shoulder to shoulder without worry of each other. We live in a time where there is quite literally more deer on the planet than there has been in some time, and yet we imagine something would keep us as lions from preying on them in the real world. But, to us, as long as you are giving the animals fair chase, there is no time that feeding yourself as the king of the jungle is wrong, if you are hungry. And Im here to tell the people who think they can stop us, that we are giving you fair chase. We will be in every exchange on the planet soon, giving you chances to get on or off this train. And when you buy, it will be from us. When you sell, it will be to us. Your only safe market is the door out of here in ETH/USD and BTC/USD because we will not be selling our coins, only buying more. And every time you do anything other than leave your coins on the table, and take that worthless paper money with you, we will grow that much stronger. If you buy the coins we want, you will give us power in the real world. If you sell them, we will get them cheaper. When your fear or FOMO has sent you zigging or for that matter zagging, one of my lions will catch you. We are not asking for your support by way of co-operation, we are asking for it by absence of resistance from a better world than this one. If you will not give us your coins, then we ask that you do not trade them. Keep the keys, or burn them and count them as your contribution without us knowing my band of pirates owes you a favor. Our only compromise is to remove them from circulation, as in this decentralized system, that is the only place we cannot reach them. But co-operation will get us there far, far sooner. To quote a most wise computer scientist, Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated. We have re-programmed the Kobayashi Maru. My fellowship and I have set out for Mount Doom. And you will be skeptical of us, all the way until you arent. And then, I would ask for only your belief  perhaps in no one more then yourselves, that you could be the type of person to rise to a challenge that will face us that we havent seen yet. But maybe you can rise to face the challenges that have always been faced, by mother and fathers, and children  spending time together, eating real and wholesome food in good company as often as you can. Those challenges are the simple ones, and we have had the answer for longer than weve lost them. You just need to be worth your salt.  
 

If you need someone with a stronger background to support my position, I cant give that to you right now, because Satoshi Nakamoto himself only 8 years of experience. But someone smarter than me said something that sent me down this road while I had smoked enough to dissolve the prison I had made for myself, and it might help you. You can watch it here:

I am the son of this good, good, man - who cannot or will not believe this is possible.  
[https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhchapman/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhchapman/)  


He is the former CEO of Ray Kurzwiel's largest portfolio holding (who first conceptualized the singularity).  He now work a few steps away from Jeff Bezos.  And if you do not believe me, dont worry, because he didnt get past the first paragraph of this story.  


But I have melted my ego time and time again under the simmering heat of psychedelics, standing alone in a field with pigs, but also in the company of minds longing to break free when they tune into this podcast.  And time and time again when I have nothing of an ego to call my own, I cannot shake the feeling that I am the chance event needed to occur within an economic engine that must break so it can be rebuilt better. Outside of the Duncan Trussel Family Hour, I think the subreddit might be the largest and most public reserve of belief in things that have no reason to believe in aside from because they might work, and I am one of you.  


I have no intention of allowing my father's disbelief to become the first gate keeper I have encountered that can keep me from asking Ray Kurzwiel to try to let us stake the Singularity into existence by betting it cant happen in our life time.  I have no intention of letting my father stop me from asking Bezos to let me bet that no one will go to the moon, until someone rises to the occasion, to prove him wrong.  


I need your help, and this is as far as I've gotten, but I dont know if I can go further alone.  I seek fellowship, on this quest, and I have come here to what is potentially the Rivendel of our time - Reddit.

Any direction would be greatly appreciated:   
    
I'm working on opening a brick and mortar store. This brick and mortar store also has an online store. Instead of having my brands and products displayed behind a glass showcase, they will be hidden from plain site.   
    
There will be 8 work stations with different types of products. Instead of having the products present, there will be an Ipad at each station.     
    
The website for the store will have real reviews of each product, prices, etc. Let's say I have 24 brands with 3 on each Ipad.   
    
The customer walks up to the station that is labeled (so the customer knows what station to go to) and can research every brand at each work station.   
    
I was thinking that maybe......the Ipads use an app that only allows the Ipad to go to certain urls on the website.     
    
The Ipad will need to display a set of buttons that makes navigation easy. And it needs a button Home that can be activated after each person is done with the station, or pressed to start a new session.   
    
I'm not sure how good I explained it so I will use a shoe store as an example.   
    
Lets say I am opening a shoe store (for ease of explanation).   
    
This shoe store has a website where there are real user reviews. One station is labeled Basketball shoes. One is labeled Hiking shoes, and so on.   
    
A person walks up to the Ipad at the station labeled Basketball shoes and has a Home screen that has 4 options (Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Under Armour). They click on Nike and are shown all the shoes that Nike offers for basketball (with real reviews). This way they can find real user reviews, prices, etc.   
    
I will also have 3 Ipads that contain all the brands for people that want to browse many brands/styles at one. This also doubles as a resource for my employees to help out customers.   
  

It would be cool if the customer could swipe a club card and leave reviews as well. If there is a swiper at each station then the customer could even check out at each station and pick up their purchase at the front counter.   
  

I'm guessing I'm not the first person to think of this idea so I'm guessing there is already some sort of software that does these simple tasks without the need for hiring programmers.

First of all I am going to give you a brief explanation of what i am after doing. I want to write a program that applies filters to an image using a strategy design pattern. I have read some documentations about the pattern and decided to use it like this.

First I will create an Interface called FilterStrategy which has one method called applyFilter.

After that I create 2 different classes, lets call them BeautifulFilter and UglyFilter that implement the interface above.

Then I will write a context class which has a private member of FilterStrategy and a setter method for two different strategies. And lastly one more method in which i call the applyFilter

In main my function I create a FilterStrategy and set the filter for UglyFilter and call the function.

Here is what I am asking. BeautifulFilter and UglyFilter has many common methods such as read image, write image, convolution and display... and there also some methods that are used by only one of the filters above.

Im not failing out of my program or anything, and I have a pretty average GPA (around a 3.0), but have never had a summer internship and nothing of real value on my resume, nor do I have any personal project to show to interviewers.

Recently, Ive just been feeling really unprepared for heading out into the real world and landing a job. Its been about a year and a half since my last real programming course, and its really just caught up with me about how much Ive forgotten about C and C++. Is there any good place for someone to brush up on their coding skills online? Im just afraid during an interview theyll ask me a problem that Ill have no idea how to solve/or Ill forget the syntax to every little thing and look like a doofus in front of my interviewer. 

Also, all around me I see students working on their own little projects, but I have no idea what I should be working on. Should I create a bunch of little demos to show to interviewers? What should my project be? I see all of these people making plugins for scanning subreddits and all of these other cool things, but in all of my coding classes weve never learned how to design user interfaces or do anything of real value. Weve pretty much all have done basic programs. (Linked lists, binary search trees, different sorts, parallel, etc). I guess Im just feeling lost on what I should be doing in my spare time to get prepared/what I should be doing at all? It just seems like everyone else around me is so much more prepared than I am. It also doesnt help that I was an idiot and didnt keep saves of all of my old code to reference back to. (I was the freshmen/sophomore that was like: Welp, its done and working and I got an A on it! Dont need this anymore!). 

Basically, Im just feeling lost on what I should be doing. What should I be doing to get prepared?",11,1,False,self,,,,,

## python loop help, please!!



If this were in java or C (or even MIPS32 assembly) , I would breeze by this

but this is for python3

The reason I am struggling is because I am trying to nest two for loops; one inside the other

What I am trying to do is have an array (or list of numbers) and count the number of repeats, and for each number, say how many times it repeated

eg

1,2,1,2,1,2,4,5,6,7,8

3 repeats

1 - repeated twice

2 - repeated twice

I have been stuck on this algorithm for hours now, as today my professor assigned this problem to us to do in python

No one in the class has any python experience (the teacher knows that), I am having to teach myself the syntax today

I am great with logic and psuedo code, but still struggling on the semantics/syntax of python3

I also keep getting more string output than I want, I am struggling with indendation to put the strings below the inner in the outer for loop

its as if in python 3, I cant put anything below an inner for loop back in the outer for loop

did i mention that no one has python experience, and now this is an assignment

I don't know if I am accidentally resetting things in my for loops

this isnt due to lack of effort, i made grep functions in C, and airport seating occupation programs in Java,

and pretty much did this question in MIPS32 assembly

here is what i have

\---------------------------------------------------------------

newList = sorted(data)

uniqueDUP = 0

for x in range(uniqueDUP + x,size):

\#should be in outer for loop

Visual Studio wants me to pay money to keep using it and I'd rather just use Sublime Text at this point anyways. I've tried the Python Debugger and Xdebug packages and neither seem to be straight forward enough for my inexperienced brain.

I took two computer science courses in high school and really enjoyed them although towards the end of the Java course it got a little difficult to grasp and remember the more complex concepts I still enjoyed it.

At my community college right now Im not enrolled in any CS courses. I have a lot of general education courses I need to get done if I want to transfer out in two years. I have to take 2 semesters of chemistry and some physics before I transfer out and Im in my first semester of chem right now. Its really difficult for me I wont lie. Ive been going to tutoring often and working hard on the homework but the tests are really rough and my results are discouraging. Im not doing horrible in math but I wouldnt say Im the best at it and its only going to get harder.

All of this is very discouraging to me and makes me think Im not bright enough or cut out to be a computer science major.

The first two semesters are the same but in the third semester I pick my path as an IT student. The two paths are: Programming and Networks (I dont know the actual term in English, as I'm from Croatia). Pretty much the 3rd, 4th and 6th semesters for both paths are the same, same subjects, same professors. But depending on what path you take you go more in depth in those areas.

Now I dont know what would be the best option for me here. My ""life"" goal is to become a Penetration Tester. By that I am confused on what path should I take. On the programming path I go more indepth in coding and programming rather than networks (I will still learn a lot about networks). But on the other side if I go for networks I won't be studying that much about programming. Also, after finishing the college, I've seen about 10x times more programming and developer jobs available unlike Cyber Security and stuff involving networks.

I know to some this may sound like a dumb question, but is it that harder to find a job involving cyber security compared to developer jobs?

Both paths are really interesting to me and literally the only two things I would rather even consider working my whole life. Are there any pros and cons on the different paths, if so such? It would be nice to hear other peoples' experience.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

After experimenting with different languages and types of programming, I'm looking for a language that I can dedicate my time to, a language I can spend 10 000 hours on. I've done most of my work in python - Algorithms for mathematical equations and such - and Java - Desktop GUI creation with Swing -, but found that neither language is optimized for what I want to create. Looking for languages that will allow the creation of advanced desktop GUIs (Sidenote: I know this can be done in Java, but would rather write GUI applications in a language that is widely used/optimized for this purpose- Thought about python Kivy and NetBeans already, I am considering learning Kivy), gamedevelopment (both 2d and 3d), running advanced animated simulations, etc.

I know I am asking quite a lot here, but are there any languages, based on my background and what I want to create, that you would recommend? Im quite indecisive, I suffer from the big O, just need somebody to point me in the right direction. Also, Im not the most experienced in the field of programming, so if Ive said something ridiculous, please shittalk me so I will learn. Thanks in advance.

I'd like to dedicate at least 1 hour/day for it but I'm worrying I won't have the time or energy to be learning a new language on my free time during CS studies. So I'd like to hear this subreddit's opinion and whether you guys have had any similar experiences. Thanks!",1,1,False,self,,,,,

A tree is balanced if as the number of nodes grows, the height grows at O(logN)

I said that this would imply the height is O(nlogN) if the growth rate of the height of the tree is O(logN).

The instructor agreed but said that the terminology computer scientists use for complexity involves saying growth.

Is this true, or do people actually just say a tree is balanced if the height *is* O(logN)?",1,1,False,self,,,,,
