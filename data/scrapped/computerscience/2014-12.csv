Wondering if I came up with a cool new solution or if this is old news.,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2nyuhy/subset_sum_test_wondering_if_i_came_up_with_a/,[deleted],1417462198,"So I was toying with figuring out on my own how to solve a subset sum for a target value and I came up with the following javascript code.  I was wondering if anyone knows if this method has been explored before?  Sorry if this is not the ideal way to describe the solution,  I don't have a CS degree or anything, I'm just a programmer who likes toying around with problems like this.  I've tried a few google searches but I don't think I'm able to describe this function in a way that will return results.  Anyway, here is my solution for subset sum.

    function subsetSum(subsetSumList, target){
    	var sums = [true];
    	var sum = 0;
    	for(var i=0; i&lt;subsetSumList.length; i++){
    		sum += subsetSumList[i];
    		if(sums[sum-target]){
    			return true;
    		}
    		sums[sum] = true;
    	}
    	return false;
    }

Also I'm really curious about how to determine a functions Big-O notation but haven't really found a description that I can wrap my head around.  Would the above function be O(n) because it only acts on each element once?

Edit: scratch the function. Found a case where it doesn't work.

Integers 0..31
Define a class that will hold the set of integers from 0 to 31. An element
can be set with the set member function and cleared with the clear member
function. It is not an error to set an element thats already set or clear an
element thats already clear. The function test is used to tell whether an
element is set.
Member functions:
void small_set::set(int item); /* Set an element in the set */
void small_set::clear(int item); /* Clear an element in the set */
int small_set::test(int item); /* See whether an element is set */
Sample usage:
small_set a_set;
a_set.set(3); /* Set contains [3] */
a_set.set(5); /* Set contains [3,5] */
a_set.set(5); /* Legal! Set still contains [3,5] */
cout &lt;&lt; a_set.test(3) &lt;&lt; ""\n""; /* Prints 1 */
cout &lt;&lt; a_set.test(0) &lt;&lt; ""\n""; /* Prints 0 */

But I want to do an implementation in C that doesn't have automatic memory management and I think some of the big ones are:

1. Dynamically sized arrays
2. Lists (different from arrays in that an object can be inserted based on its index position, similar to the above in that it will require the underlying structure to be dynamically sized)
3. Matrices
4. Tuples
5. Stacks (Last in First Out) &amp; Queues (First in First Out)
6. Binary trees (although a rather summary treatment of this is probably all that I will be able to manage in my time frame)

Can I get a few pointers (bad pun)? Is this list probably about right? Can anyone suggest any more? Or perhaps some that aren't as important? ",8,5,False,self,,,,,

I'll try to keep this post as concise as possible.  I'm not really even sure if this is the best subreddit for this question so if there is a better place for it please let me know.

Essentially, here is the situation I find myself in.  I am currently a senior in college - however, I was a finance major for my first two semesters, and of the 28 credits I earned in that major, only 1 credit (some random elective) was from a class that is also an option for CompSci majors.  That effectively set me back a year in my major (switched after freshman year) though I have done a fair job of getting caught back up to where I would be had I started in computer science.  Partly due to that circumstance and partly due to my own inability to just grow up for some time after, I got pretty far behind in terms of internships and other extracurriculars.  Where most of my buddies had internships during the summer of their sophomore or junior year, I didn't really take charge and get my act together until relatively recently.

So, I finally took the time to put together a quality resume and apply for some internships a few weeks ago.  I was pretty worried because my grades really aren't that great - I'm at about a 2.9 now (to be fair though, my ""technical"" GPA is a lot better, probably closer to a 3.5 FWIW).  I suppose I lucked out, however, as my university has a very good career services network.  I was contacted a few weeks ago regarding a technical writing position with a relatively local company, and after interviewing on site this morning they offered me an internship position this afternoon.

There is a caveat, however, that I only learned about in the interview earlier today.  They are looking for someone to start in January, and given the location it would not be possible for me to continue school and take the internship.  

So I've spent the evening discussing my options with my parents and thinking about what I would like to do and I really think the internship would be an excellent experience.  My uneducated guess is that a technical writing position may not be the best in terms of padding my resume; however, I think it would be a great fit for me personally as writing is another of my strengths (as well as something I really enjoy doing).  Furthermore, the woman who was primarily responsible for designing the software that I will spend a lot of time documenting is pretty brilliant from what I can tell, and I think that the opportunity to spend a lot of time discussing her own software with her would really give me some valuable insight on the thought processes of an experienced member of the field.  In short, while I am trying to be wary of just jumping on the first internship offer I received, I genuinely think I'd be a great fit for the position.

That being said I wanted to bounce the idea off some of you who have some experience not just in the field but really with careers in general.  I've always been under the impression that the work experience from an internship is vastly more helpful than most of the stuff I will learn in the classroom, but I could be wrong about that.  I'm just a bit nervous to make the decision because after going 7 consecutive semesters it feels pretty strange to be considering taking a break for one, even if it is to do an internship.  I have to admit however that my living situation this year is what I would call ""sub-optimal"", as my roommate basically sits on the couch smoking and watching TV all day and I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't like to get out of that environment.  I don't want that to influence any feedback you guys can provide, however; mostly I just mention it to demonstrate that if there were an ideal time for me to change things up for a bit this would be it.

To be honest I'm kind of having trouble coming up with reasons that I shouldn't do this, which is why I'm making this post.  The main drawback obviously is that I will delay my graduation date by a semester which only leaves more time for the ever-increasing volume of graduating CS majors to take jobs, but given that my current experience with an actual job related to the field is approximately zilch I'm inclined to believe that the trade-off is worth it.  I'm hoping you guys can provide me with some perspective as far as that is concerned.  I don't know if this is much of a factor, but as a result of my efforts to get caught up with my degree I'm currently slated to graduate in December of next year, and the internship would push that to May of the following year.  I have heard that graduating in December can sometimes be less than ideal because a lot of companies aren't recruiting as heavily at that time.  Again, however, I don't really know how this works in practice but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Since I've already failed to keep this post relatively brief I'll just wrap it up there.  Thanks in advance for any advice you can give, I really appreciate it.

**TL;DR:**  I'm a senior but I'm essentially ""junior status"" in my CS major as I switched after freshman year.  Haven't had an internship or any job in the field and I have just received an offer for one which I think will be well-suited to my strengths, but it starts in January as opposed to being in the summer so I would take this semester off school.  Is it worth delaying my graduation in order to get some much-needed experience in an actual work environment?

**Edit:** Really quickly I want to gloss over a point I forgot to mention in my original post.  One thing I have heard mentioned and been warned about regarding this issue is that oftentimes students who do this will end up being offered an official position with the company they interned at which leads them to not go back and finish their degree, often having bad results down the line.  While it is impossible for me to predict the future I just want to mention that I am very aware of this possibility and I have *every* intention of returning to school immediately after completing the internship, and I have discussed that briefly with the manager as well.  While I maintain that I believe this is an excellent opportunity for me I still don't think I've even scratched the surface in terms of what I could do with my degree and I would like to explore as many different options as possible before making any long-term decisions.  Like I said I do know this is something that happens often to people who are in my position but I have simply invested too much of my time and money into my education to even consider dropping it or even indefinitely postponing it in lieu of an early full-time position.",8,1,False,self,,,,,

I took all of the courses from my university's undergraduate curriculum, but I changed the names a little bit to make them more general.  All the resources on there so far are ones that I collected while I was an undergraduate (many, many of them from this and other CS/Programming related subreddits), but the list is far from complete.  Some of the topics don't even have resources associated with them because I either didn't know of any, or didn't take that course.  If anyone has a resource that they would like to see added, there is a ""Suggest a resource"" link at the top of the page, or you could send them to me here on reddit.

Hopefully this will serve as a good resource for people learning computer science or people needing to brush up on some concepts. This is my first website so I would love any feedback on it, and I would really love any other resources you guys have. I know the design it a little plain, but I was going for functionality first. I am going to be learning more about web design and trying to update it and make it prettier in the future. Anyway, enjoy! And thank you for helping me get through my undergrad years!

Definition 1:
Whenever 'n' is used throughout this paper, it is defined as follows:
Let n be some integer s.t. n &gt; 0.
Express n in standard binary format and add leading 0's such that number of digits (bits) equals 2k, where k is the smallest integer s.t. n &lt; 2k 
This is exactly equivalent to standard computer storage of an integer as a nibble (4 bits), a byte (8bits), 16 bit integer, 32 bit integer... always choosing the smallest data type that is large enough to contain n.
Definition 2:
ni is the ith bit of n (thus ni = 0 or ni = 1)
Definition 3:
0j is a bit-string of 0's i bits long and 0i ith 0 of such a bit-string
Definition 4:
^ is exclusive operator on 2 bits:
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
Definition 5: 
The 'Prime Tick' of integer n, 'n, is defined recursively as follows:
'n1= 1 ^ n1
'ni+1 = 'ni ^ ni+1
We recurse the whole length of the bit-string, including any leading 0's added to n as described in definition 1.
Definition 6: 'Tick' of integer n, ""n, is defined recursively as follows:
If n = 0j, then n"" = 'n. (i.e. if n = 0j, we use the 'Prime Tick' Operator)
Else ""n1 = nk ^ n1
""ni+1 = ""ni ^ ni+1 
Recurse the whole length of the bit-string until ""nk = ""nk-1 ^ nk
Lemma 1:
'0j = 2j - 1
Proof:
'01 = 1 ^ 0  = 1
Now let '0i = 1, then
'0i+1 = '0i ^ 0i+1 = 1 ^ 0 = 1
By Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI),
'0i = (11...1) = 2j -1
Definition 7: ""q(n), where q is a positive integer, means apply 'Tick' Operator q times
Definition 6: Q Operator on a positive integer n is defined as follows:
Q(n) = ""...""(""n), where we recursively apply the 'Tick' Operator until one of 2 cases occure:
a) ""q(n) = ""p(n), for some p, q such that 0 &lt; p &lt; q
b) ""q(n) = 0j, for some q
Note that in case a) the 'Tick' Operator generates a cycle of length q - p. (Proof omitted; it is not necessary to prove our Theorem)
Lemma 2: if ""m = 0j, then m = 1 and j = 0
First observe that ""1 = 1^1 = 0
Now Proof by Contradiction:
Suppose ""m = 0j, for some integer j &gt; 0 , and n != 1
Then, either m = 0j or m !=0j
Case A: m = 0j
then ""m = '0j = 1j != 0 (by Lemma 1)
Case B: m != 0j
then m = (m1m2...mj) in base 2, where j mis a binary digit and at least 1 mj is 1.
let mr = 1, be first 1 in bit-string
if r != 0
then
""mr = ""mr-1 ^ mr
Since n1...nr-1 are all 0, and 0 ^ 0 = 0, we know ""nr-1 = 0
Therefore:
""mr = 0 ^ 1 = 1, therefore ""m != 0
if r = 1, then
""mr = mk ^ m1, where k is length of m expressed as a bit-string
Then either:
a) ""mr =1 ^ 0 = 1    ==&gt;    n"" != 0
or
b) ""mr = 1 ^ 1 = 0
if case b), then find mi such that mi is first 1 in bit-string s.t. i &gt;= 2
then
""mi =  ""mi-1 ^ mi
""mi = 0 ^ 1 = 1 ==&gt; ""m!=0
Since m1...mi-1 are all 0, and 0 ^ 0 = 0, we know ""mi-1 = 0
QED
Definition 7: The Modal Modulus of Q(n), |Q(n)|, is the number of distinct integers, not including 0i, in the sequence generated by Q (n)
Definition 8:
If Q(n) generates a cycle, and |Q(n)| = 2k - 1, we say that Q(n) is Maximal and write:
Q(n) = O(n)
We call O(n) a Formal Q-Cycle
Note that this means O(n) generates a cycle that includes every integer from 1 to 2k
Lemma 3: |Q(3)| = 3
Proof:
3 is (11) base 2
""(11) = 01
""(01) = 10
""(10) = 11
We call (11) the First Formal Tick and write
|(11)| = 1
We call (01) the Second Formal Tick and write
|(01)| = 2
We call (10) the Thirst Formal Tick and write
|(10)| = 3
Lemma 4: |Q(15)| = 15
Proof:
15 is (1111) base 2
""(1111) = 0101
""(0101) = 1001
""(1001) = 0001
""(0001) = 1110
""(1110) = 1011
""(1011) = 0010
""(0010) = 0011
""(0011) = 1101
""(1101) = 0110
""(0110) = 0100
""(0100) = 0111
""(0111) = 1010
""(1010) = 1100
""(1100) = 1000
""(1000) = 1111
Again, we call (1111) the First Formal Tick, (0101) the Second Formal Tick ... through to (1000) the Fifteenth Formal Tick, and write:
|(1111)| = 1
|(0101)| = 2
...
|(1000)| = 15

Lemma 5: Quantic Powers Lemma [QPL] 
22k - 1 = (22(k-1) - 1) x 2k + (22(k-1) - 1)
Proof:
Let '&lt;&lt;' be the binary 'left bit-shift' operator that shift every bit in a bit-string to the left by a specified integral amount.
So, a &lt;&lt; k, is eviquivalent to, a x 2k
Then,
22k = 1 &lt;&lt; 2k, in binary
22k - 1 = (1 &lt;&lt; 2k) - 1 = (111213...12k)2
            = (1112...1k0k+1...02k) + (0102...0k1k+1...12k)2
            = ((22(k-1)) &lt;&lt; k) + (22(k-1) - 1)
            =  (22(k-1) - 1) x 2k + (22(k-1) - 1)

Theorem 1: 
Nishikala's Little Theorem
For all n, s.t n = 22k - 1, |O(""n)| = 22k - 1
Proof:
3 = 22 -1 and 15 = 24 -1 (Lemmas 2 and 3), So Theorem holds for k =1and k = 2.
Assume:
a) |O(""(22k - 1))| = 22k -1
and
b) |O(""(22j - 1))| = 22j - 1, For all 0 &lt; j &lt; k
S0,
22(k+1) - 1 = (22k - 1) x 2k+1 + (22k - 1), (Quantic Powers Lemma [QPL])
