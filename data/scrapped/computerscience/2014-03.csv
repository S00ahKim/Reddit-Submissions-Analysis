It feels like literally everyone around me is pulling A's and all of the material is just review for them--while I am actually struggling to learn the material.  
  
This is a bit disheartening, and I am starting to question my path more and more. I got a B in my intro Java class, but I really had to work for it. Now I am taking a discrete math class (which I really do not enjoy), and an intro to data structures. Overall, it just seems like everyone knows so much it's ridiculous. I thought we were in college to learn this these things?? Frequently students will ask questions during lecture that are related to topics or details we won't get to for a few more weeks, and my professor tells them don't worry we will get to it. I almost feel like all of these vocal students with tons of experience really raise the bar for students who are actually learning along with the material.  
  
Today I got back my first midterm in my data structures class and got a 68%. Pretty beaten up about it too, for after looking it over there were a few questions where I knew it was between 2 and I choice the wrong choice...each question worth 5% of the exam. Our professor told us that the TAs predicted the average would be around a 72%, but somehow my class nearly had a 79% average! What is going on here? Am I not cut out for computer science, or am I just unluckily surrounded by all these super experienced programmers? I have always wanted to major in computer science since the beginning of high school, and I am very down on myself for the way these first two semesters of college are panning out.  Is it normal to struggle this much, and am I on a path to failure?

It might be important to state that I graduated with a bachelor's in molecular biology and therefore lack any knowledge in computer science.

With the school requiring 5 core pre-req courses before being allowed to register for grad school level courses, I felt that it would prepare me for the advanced lessons.  However, there are concepts that the professors incorporate during their lectures, sort of like ""as you all know..."", that I struggle to understand while most of the students seem to know.   Also, the school year is divided into trimesters. With a lack of foundation and working full time, the quicker pace of a trimester feels like I'm always understanding what is going on a little too late.  And I do end up understanding what is being taught, but it seems it's always after doing poorly on the exams and studying more than what I feel the rest of the class needs to do.  So I am debating whether an undergrad program is better for me.  The slower pace in which I start from the basic courses seems like it will be the best way to approach computer science.

I'm currently a high school senior who will be studying computer science next year in college (University of Texas, Austin!). I'm in the process of deciding on a laptop for next year, and I've been looking more and more into getting a Mac. I've used a PC for all my life and I've done all my previous programming work on a PC, but I feel like it might be interested in switching.

My idea is to get either a PC laptop (win7 or win8) and dual boot Ubuntu or get a Macbook Pro and dual boot windows (in case I need to use software that is windows specific) and virtual machine Ubuntu when necessary. The laptops will likely have around the same performance (quad core i7, 16gb RAM, 512 SSD, etc...) and price isn't really a factor to be considered (both of them would end up costing around the same, in my specific case).

Which option would be ideal for computer science/programming? I've noticed a lot of computer science students and programming using Macs lately and I wasn't sure if there was a specific reason for this (other than that Macs are Unix-based) or just because of the Apple fad. Is having a Unix-based OS really that big of a deal? Are there any other options (other than the two I listed above) that I'm missing? I have a lot of questions, so don't feel obligated to answer all of them. Any input would be appreciated. Thank you!",23,3,False,self,,,,,

    I do not want to go to a school that is extremely expensive since I just paid off my loans from college and do not want to build a huge debt again.

We were learning about pipelining code for optimization and various shortcuts Intel made (Free Lunch) in the past decade while creating processors to help speed up code while requiring no extra work on the end of the programmer. 

But then weird stuff started happening: lights begin to flickers, the floor was rumbling, the walls began to shake and crack. Was it an earthquake? Our professor begins to guide us to the door  the goal was to move to a more stable and safer part of the building. However, the door wouldnt budge. We were completely locked in. A sinkhole appeared in the middle of campus. The windows had cracks working through them as we cowered under the desk. 

I was scared for my life and so was everyone else. Will I die here? Quickly, in an effort to appease the Computer Science gods our professor screamed to repent for any use of a goto in our code  perhaps that would settle things. But nothing worked. The floor starting falling through.

Thats when it happened. The door was kicked down and a bright flash of light filled the room. There stood Richard Stallman and Steve Wozniak in something that looked liked a Ghostbusters uniform. I have never seen a pair of beards so glorious and wept in the excitement of the moment. The shaking ceased, the lights stayed off.

Both gentlemen whip out what would normally be used to suck up ghosts  except they werent after ghosts. They were after closed-source softwareyes, Closed-Source-Busters. The room began glowing with binary code for Windows and iOS devices as it was sucked through the ether.

When the events settled down I saw a single tear fall down Wozs face as he exclaimed, Job well done, Stallman. A swell job we have done. We all begin to weep in joy. Windows has been removed from all campus computers and replaced with Linux, what a glorious day.

It was then that Richard Stallman looked me right dead in the eyes and said, Im going to need about tree fiddy.

It was about that time that I realized Stallman and Woz were about eight stories tall and were crustaceans from the Paleozoic era. I yelled, Monstah, I aint givin you no tree-fiddy!

Now with that being said, I've been analyzing what jobs are hottest for growth and opportunities. Software Developer constantly tops the list every single time. Along with Sofware, System Analyst and Information Security Analyst also top the lists. I was wondering what would be a more viable career choice. I understand from other posts, I should go with a degree in CS as opposed to CIS. My gripe with that is programming and code do not appeal to me. I am also horrendous with math and I hear math is a HUGE factor in majoring in Computer Science. I've also been told some companies place more of an emphasis on Certs and Experience as opposed to the degree. I wanted to ask those of you with experience in both career fields what you would suggest and perhaps, if you're willing, to share some of your experiences with me. Tips and pointers are also encouraged and appreciated.
