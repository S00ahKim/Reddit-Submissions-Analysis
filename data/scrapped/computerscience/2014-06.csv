It's frustrating because my GPA is higher than my friends (currently a 3.5) and I'm still struggling to get a single software engineering internship from the coasts. I did apply online and get an interview at Microsoft a few weeks ago (which was a cool experience because they flew me out from Detroit to their headquarters in Redmond, WA). But I haven't gotten a call yet so I think they said no. The only internship I've done so far is from Ford Motor's IT department. 

How can I guarantee myself a job as a software engineer after I graduate? It's my dream job and I just wouldn't enjoy working as a information systems analyst or an undesirable IT job. What can I do to get a software engineering job and not some low salary IT job?",4,1,False,default,,,,,

See a quick diagram to help with the explanation [here](http://imgur.com/jQoqVZr)

Basically, I have 1 to many 'buckets' each containing some number of items. I want to take these items and distribute them over a timeline by using some sort of function.  I suppose I could go ahead and write a piece of code that distributes them, but I would prefer to have a more mathematically precise way of doing it.

The distributing function, F(a,b, ..., z) has parameters that ideally determine what the distribution of the items from the respective bucket will look like.  Then, by varying the parameters one can come up with an optimal distribution over the timeline.  

Also, a feedback loop could be used where a distribution is computed on the timeline, measured for some ""goodness"" depending on the application and then the parameters adjusted.  To me this approach feels a little bit like a binary search in terms of time complexity. 

Anyways, an good real life example could be medication scheduling. Where each bucket contains one kind of medication, with some number of pills that must be taken throughout the day. Then you could find an 'optimal' schedule according to some set of requirements input by the patient/doctor. 

Any comments are welcome, hopefully I did an OK job explaining this. ",3,2,False,self,,,,,

I ask because in the middle 80s and early 90s, I was on the fringes of the UNIX community. (I wasn't a technologist. Just an observer.) It was a terrific time to be in that space. UNIX itself was developing by leaps and bounds. Individuals and companies (sometimes very small) were coming into the market and doing wild and wonderful things. The open source movement was heating up. The workstation companies, like Sun and SGI, were the coolest places to work on the planet. Everyone was moving to Los Altos if they could. And, oh yes, AT&amp;T Information Systems was there to bumble about and provide comic relief. 

Alas, all that sort of went away in early 2000s. The UNIX market got corporate. PCs and Macs caught up with the workstations. And, I suppose, the energy and vitality shifted to the web and then to Smartphone apps. 

But, here's my question. Is there a place in computing right now where it is like what UNIX was then? Someplace where all the rules are fluid and the distinction between entrepreneur, technical expert, and outright hobbyist is kind of vague?
