I've dabbled in programming so I understand the basics of logic and program code, but I have never understood one thing.  What the hell am I waiting on with Windows Updates or any other program?  I check out the Performance manager and I don't see the computer working at 100% on either the processor or the harddrive, it's just sitting there doing nothing for long periods of time.

I would think that the computer would work as fast as possible to finish the task, and I can't seem to identify any bottlenecks as nothing is working 100% of the time most of the time.  Why is it sitting idle?  In any of the small programs I have written, the processor was always spiking to 100% to complete the task as fast as possible, what is it about other more complex programs that seem to be taking their sweet time?

I'm looking for as technical of an answer as possible.  Thank you!",1,2,False,default,,,,,

I am a 17 year old male from LA and I just have a few questions about computer science.  For the past few years I have found computer science as a passion of mine and although I haven't done much with it, I know that I want to go down that path for my future.  In using a program called Unity a few years ago for making video games, I realized to do anything with it, I needed to learn javascript and C# and so I started working with javascript.  I took some online courses on Codecademy and some free online tutorials but I always found myself taking a few days off halfway through which led me to forgetting everything that I had learned the few days prior.  Since then, I have tried numerous times to learn other languages and work with it, but I always find myself struggling to keep up with that and the rest of the things in my busy life.  

I have learned the 'basics' of many languages such as Java, Python, Javascript, ObjectiveC, C++, and C# but have not gone anywhere with them and at this point, I have forgotten almost everything.  

As a senior in high school, I am thinking about college next year and I have decided that, yet in lack of motivation, I still want to pursue anything relating to computer science as a career.  I watched a video made by code.org and at one point, someone mentioned that they have to sit in a room for nearly 14-15 hours a day just straight coding.  While most would see this as painful, tedious work, I think the opposite.  My dream is to be able to sit in a room for that long and code because to have the knowledge and to know what to do that entire time just sounds incredible.  I want to know everything that I can and be able to do anything I want with coding and to make video games and other computer programs.  I know that it is A LOT of work and yes it is very tedious, but I just want to be able to do it.  So I have decided that my major in college will be Computer Science and maybe some form of game design/creation.  

I was wondering how I could get a start on this since I will be attending college next year and I don't want to be lost and start from the beginning.  Where do I start and where do I go to begin my journey?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance.

tldr; I have a passion for computer science and want to pursue it as a career.  How can I prepare this for college next year.",6,0,False,self,,,,,
