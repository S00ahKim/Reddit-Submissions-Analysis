My name is Stefan, as a high school student I had no mentors or general guidance on what to do with my life. After signing up for premed the year before college started, I dropped out a couple months later after losing my scholarships.  

Years later I went back to a community college, wasted a year on classes I shouldn't have taken, and eventually transferred to the University of Toledo.  The University of what you may ask? Yeah I can't say I blame you for that one. Definitely not where I planned on going.  But even after the struggle, I eventually landed a six figure job working at one of the top companies.  I am blogging about my journey and my continued journey of self improvement to everyone interested. 

I am not selling anything, merely wanting to help the younger generation interested in the field that will eventually be the main basis for our future.

I put in the time, effort, and passion, but despite my efforts, I'm graduating with a 2.75-2.8. Not deplorable, but not competitive. Part of the problem was that I spent my first two years also majoring in chemistry, which I found fascinating, but ultimately it spread me too thin to succeed, and I had to choose between chemistry and CS. I did manage to get involved with a computational chemistry research group, and I'm soon to publish my first paper (as first author to boot). It involves the application of machine learning to a large, relevant problem in bio engineering, and I've very much enjoyed the research process.

 I've managed to land a really nice job offer from a tech company who, on top of everything else, has offered to pay my way through a master's degree if I so choose. Before now, I'd never considered grad school, but I have a genuine passion for CS and for research, and I'm beginning to think I'd be foolish to not take my soon-to-be employer up on the offer. I also met a professor this semester who has really redefined my aspirations as a scientist, and I've begun to feel compelled to stay in academia a little longer.

In looking into online master's programs, however, the standard seems to be (understandably) a 3.0 at the minimum. I'm curious to know if anyone with graduate experience can lend me some insight? I'm a veteran with an associate's degree in Arabic and 3 years research experience, I'm sure I can get some glowing recommendations, and the tuition would be covered, I'm just worried that my GPA would be enough to get shut down by anywhere I'd apply to.

**Math**


-Trig or Pre-Calc or Calc I


-Discrete Math I


-Discrete Math II



**CS**


-Foundations of CS I


-Foundations of CS II


-Assembly Language


-Object-Oriented Design &amp; Programming


-Computer Ethics


-Data Structures &amp; Algorithms 


-Computer Architecture


-Software Engineering





**CS Project, choose one:** (same for BS)


-Compiler Construction


-Human Factors of Computer Systems


-Computer System Security


-Parallel Programming


-Software Engineering Project

**B.S.**



(Includes the class ""Operating Systems."" 16 credits in science vs. 8 credits for the BA. Includes more math, and has 3 more credits for CS Advanced Electives.

-Pre-Calc


-Calc I


-Calc II


-Discrete Math I


-Discrete Math II


-Probability and Statistics 




**CS**


All the same CS classes, besides the BS includes **Operating Systems**, and **three** more credits of CS Advanced Electives.

**NOTE:** I will need to take Discrete Math I the same semester as Pre-Calc or Calc I, and Discrete Math II the same semester as Calculus I or Calc II to get out with the BS only one semester later than the BA (as long I make a C in them) 


**Note 2** I work 32 hours a week and will be when I transfer to Uni.

About 75% of our assignments are partner labs which she requires partners to be in the same place at the same time.

First off I'm sorry if this kind of post isn't allowed here, but I was just hoping someone could give me some kind of opinion on the course I've chosen and more specifically the 2nd major I'll be deciding on in the next couple of days. 

I posted this question on CSCareerQuestions a while back, but maybe that was the wrong place to put it. I might just link the post here and people can reply to it here if they would like.

My question is roughly the same, although now I'm almost fully decided on Maths as my 2nd Major to go with Comp Sci. Those other Majors on that list seem a bit markety/gimmicky?

Is there anything glaringly bad about either of my Major's (Computer Science &amp; Mathematics and Statistics) in terms of course content, I guess you could also note the good points too. I'm also doing this degree externally as I have to work full time and have a family as well so I'm having a bit of a hard time in this first semester as some of this content is hard to learn externally, but I'm going to stick with it and work hard.

Is it acceptable to email companies I'm interested in asking which courses they suggest students take, or are there ""general"" courses that usually most companies look for? Also, anything volunteer related I can do that will look good on my resume? Or even ""abilities"" that look good (languages, courses, etc)? 

PS.: Not sure if relevant, but I would be an international student in Canada, I am female (yeah I heard that there's quite a lot of sexism in this field), in my early 20s, and I am mostly interested in video games, AI, and social media, though I am still unsure.

Using least squares is good, however it can be thrown off drastically by an outlier. So, we were to minimize the maximum absolute deviation to find the best fit line. That directed me to the [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_absolute_deviations#Solving_using_linear_programming) section of the least absolute deviations Wikipedia article.

Firstly, I most definitely encourage your continuation of your pursuit of Computer Science. It's *hard*. In fact, as a Computer Scientist, you are a professional ""creative"" problem solver.
By the very nature of what we do, we must be agile in approaching each problem, as our field is continually changing and moving in many, many directions. It can be hard to keep up with it all, and incredibly daunting to even approach. 

Even once you've reached your stride, you may find it challenging to take it all in; so I wanted to share my story and its incredibly unlikely destination of CS. 

In High School, I wanted to be an artist. More specifically, I wanted to be a character designer for some video game / movie company. However, come time to apply for college, after a great deal of contemplation and discussion with my parents, I opted to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering (but I had a history of being rubbish at maths). I had a slight taste of programming with a class on Visual Basic (which hardly counts). 

Then, came college. Freshman year was *exhausting*. Never before had I experienced a real programming language; but in our introductory course we learned C++ and Python. In retrospect, these concepts aren't as challenging as I *perceived* it to be. This was an insurmountable obstruction. I struggled vehemently, and to make it worse, I had enrolled in the ""advanced"" section, wherein you were expected to have prior programming experience. I came in expecting visual basic and found, instead, the monster of C++.

I felt as though I was at the bottom of the pack, taking hours against my peers' alleged minutes to complete an assignment. 

*In fact*, come the end of my class, I had proudly proclaimed that:

##I am never taking a CS course again! 

I was so excited; CS was a huge challenge and I finally managed to endure to the class's end. Turns out, I hated Electrical Engineering, but I felt trapped, I had no other options. There was nothing I liked!

But, this couldn't have been further from the truth. I missed the challenge contained in each assignment and the triumph I felt upon finally submitting my *masterpiece*. 

So, I went back. 

This year, I am a Junior in College, though I am a Sophomore in the CS program, here. I have a solid 3.7 in my CS courses and I couldn't be happier with my decision to stick it through.

Point being, everyone starts somewhere different. Hell, I am a year behind! (My girlfriend, a Freshman, is already taking many of the courses directly prior to mine...which sucks, but I'm still making *progress*). In fact, I have failed every single Calculus class I have ever taken before passing it (not a C- or above). Discrete mathematics and onward were no problem, but it's not like I didn't struggle! 

As long as *you* are better at what you're doing today than when you were yesterday, that's all that matters. 

So, do your homework, struggle through your project, pursue your interests. It *will* pay off. You'll be happier for it; you'll experience that legendary satisfaction, and if you're devoted, you will out-mode your peers or colleagues. 

If a pleb like me can figure it out;
you, kind friend, most definitely can. ",7,43,False,self,,,,,

Hopefully I have better luck here. This is the straight copied contents of my post:

***START POST***

I am building a parser generator, not for any project in particular, just for fun to improve my understanding of parsing, grammars, languages, etc.

I am at the point where I have lexer generation down pat. That is, I have defined a way to specify token definitions from regexes and split an input string into tokens based on those definitions.

Now I am to the point of building a parser by specifying BNF productions for a grammar. Based on my initial research, I need to convert the grammar to a pushdown automaton. What I've read has told me that I need to do so in 3 steps:

1. Convert the grammar to Chomsky Normal Form (all productions have either a single terminal or two non-terminals).
2. Convert from Chomsky Normal Form to Greibach Normal Form (all productions have either a single terminal or a terminal followed by a sequence of non-terminals).
3. Convert from Greibach Normal Form to a Pushdown Automaton.

There are clear enough algorithms for doing these three steps. However, I am not sure how to go about the actual running of the PDA once I have it. My problem is not with how a PDA works, but with ambiguity.

Basically, I have the following questions:

- Should I account for the fact that a grammar may be ambiguous, or is it a reasonable constraint on the grammar writer to enforce that the grammar be unambiguous?
- If I allow ambiguous grammars, will this add significant overhead to the process of running the PDA? Is there a performant way of running a non-deterministic PDA?
- While on the topic of determinism, can an ambiguous grammar generate a deterministic PDA?
- Will an unambiguous grammar always generate a deterministic PDA?
- I know that determining whether a grammar is ambiguous or not is undecidable, but is there a heuristic that works in most cases?

Basically, in my work on the lexer portion of this parser, I was able to transform non-deterministic finite automata to deterministic finite automata, which allowed me to run the lexer in basically linear time, but I understand that this is not possible to do with pushdown automata, so I'm curious what implications this has on the parsing process, and how I might go about doing this.

***END POST***

Perhaps more information is required, I'm not sure. As a more broad question, what are ways that parser generators such as ANTLR use to convert a grammar to a runnable parser? If they don't use pushdown automata, what do they use instead, and why is it better than a PDA?",1,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm an incoming CS sophomore, and my first year experience is unsatisfactory. As a background, I finished up an Associate's Degree in Multimedia Technology about a year and a half ago. I'm going to take all the blame for this, but I didn't learn a damn practical thing from it. So I took half a year to teach myself programming. This is probably the best turnaround of my life since I created strong habits and developed self-discipline, because learning by yourself (plus the internet and its lovely inhabitants) takes a lot of will and effort to be fruitful. Anyways, I decided to take up Bachelors in CS with my girlfriend, with the expectations of that a ""formal"" environment will take my skills and knowledge to greater heights.

So on my first semester, I had an **Internet Technologies** class while my girl had **Data Structure and Algorithms**. So I felt like I hit a jackpot since I'm a WebDev guy, and I'm quite confident to help my girl since I *kinda* know how Big-O and Sorting Algorithms work (back then).

Aaaaannnnnddd, I was taught to write inline styles and use `&lt;table&gt;` to layout my projects. At that point I thought, ""this is terrible practice, but hey, maybe his style is to build upon old ways of creating markup then slowly introduce how modern HTML works"". But nope. That's all my professor taught us. With that knowledge we were asked to create a prototype for whatever business we might want to create a website in. And my girl? I asked her what algorithms were taught, and she said they were just taught how to write pseudo-code and proceeded to learn Java and create a POS system with it.

Okay, so maybe we just had tough luck with the instructors. The next semester I had a **C Language** class with my girlfriend. I was excited to finally learn *pointers*! First day of class, he taught us that C# is the best because it has 4 `+` signs, the next is C++ because is has 2, and C is the ""starting point"" because it has none. I asked why is that the case, and he responded because the `+` is like a versioning number for the language. I also learned how to write code with an abundant amount of `goto` statements, which also doesn't work cross-platform for some reason (probably the Windows only header files in code::blocks). 

So my first year is over, and I'm feeling crap about my uni. Am I being a jerk for thinking all these?

I basically said if the classes of the two objects are the same, cast the argument as a LinkedBag. I then called the Arrays.equals(bag1, bag2) method to compare the bags when I called the toArray() method on each of the bags.

I am a 13-year old male, and I've been interested in computers for a long time. I have an advance understanding for computers in my age-group, at least in my area. Here's a bit of a life so you get to know me:
I gained interest in computing at the age of 7, when I started playing ROBLOX.com. You see, I wanted to be a rich ROBLOXian, so I tried to find a ROBLOX blackmarket, which led me to v3rmillion.net. I was an active user, and learned the basics. I learned the names of programming languages, what Paypal was, how to type over 30 words per minute, and what a DDoS attack IS. I didn't learn the actual content, such as the difference between DDoS and DoS, but I learned what they were, and bought a booter. At this point, I was about 9 when I bought my first booter. Yes, I was a skid. Now, I'm one of the edgy ROBLOXians. So since I'm the cool kid on the block with his tight booter, and his knowledge of what whitepages.com is, I started DOXing people in real life. Then, things kept advancing and I accessed hackforums.net , where I got on the wrong side of the internet. I met a famous scammer who is now sentenced to prison named Sweezle, and he was where I went into a deeper side of the internet. He introduced me to carding, deepweb wikis, scamming, and more. So, I go back to v3rmillion.net, and now I'm a scammer. I made over 100 dollars scamming several times, which is nothing compared to a real scammer. I'm a skid at this point still, threatening people with booters and thinking that I DOX people, using Skype Resolvers. Except, here's where I evolve. So, you remember Sweezle, right? Sweezle carded and then transferred to Amazon Giftcards, and I let him order them to my house for 20 dollars Paypal. I was thankful enough not to get raided, but after this Sweezle betrayed me. Chargebacked, started leaking some info, etc. He was my mentor and I had respected him before, but now I was screwed.
I decided I wasn't for the ROBLOXian hacker life, so I quit and hiberated to just light-foruming on Leakforums, where I would learn some stuff, but not much. After this, I'm 12. Well, I had unblocked Sweezle at this point because he scared me, as I was 12. and didn't realize he couldn't SWAT. Since he scared me so much, I followed all of his orders again. He tells me to social engineer my friend into ordering cards to his house, I do it. Tells me to write his name on my arm, I do it. But I got an ego because of I was friends with a ""hacker"" (he's not a hacker, complete skid, you'll find out why). So I'm put into my place of course, as a man named MALWARE decides to actually teach me what a hacker is. I was playing around on the Deepweb, being edgy, and Malware DOXed me and found my Skype. So he manages to RAT me, and he scared me so bad I didn't touch a computer for a week. He SWATTed me, he put screamers on, called my mom with pranks, and more. He put me into my place on the internet, and at THAT point, I knew I was nothing. 
So now let's skip a few months forward, I'm still 12, and Sweezle still owns me. So, my mom was a druggist and a alcohol addict, so one night, she got highly drunk, and then mixed alcohol with some form of opoids. She died overnight, and she wouldn't wake up when I touched her. So I call our ""best friend Sweezle"" who would explain to me how to check if shes dead, via pulse on the neck. She was dead. Now, Sweezle starts making fun of me and such, so I was done. I blocked him and called my grandmother, who told me to call the police and started driving to my house. So, she was confirmed to be dead. It took them a year to find out if she was actually dead, and she was. The police didn't look through my computer, but that didn't matter. She was dead.
Now I am 13, and I actually start to think. I can be successful with computers if I stop being stupid and do my work. So I joined the IB program, which is basically a harder version of AP. So now I was taking academically advanced classes, and I had extra time on my hands. So I started to pick up actual things in the computer field, such as A+, building computers, or how RAT's and how DDoS/DoS attacks actually work, the mechanics of computers. 
So I have set a goal to learn to code, and advance within math. I want to prove to the site that even damaged children can learn to code at an early age, they just need to effort.
My first project will be to learn Python.
Second goal, understand data structures and algorithm.
Third goal, learn C++
Fourth goal, Java.
Fifth goal, Reverse Engineering knowledge.

This sorting algorithm has been a pain in the butt since it started. I'm not sure if it is any better than pre-existing algorithms because I have no way to express the complexity. Many of you stated in the past that the boxset sizes would be too large for it to be linear time. Then I thought of using medians to get a o(logn) thing going and then I realized you can use the number that causes a new boxset to be created as the pivot. But I also realized that large numbers would have large boxsets and small ones small- the same n2 situation. So I decided to find the biggest number smaller than the conflict number in the current list (o(n) search) and find how many numbers are smaller than that and subtract how many are smaller than the conflict to find the maximum number of elements. If this is not clear please let me know.

I realize it might be o(n^2 ) because the number of times you can have conflicts might be o(n) but i think not because there is the reindexing case. For example if n/2 of the boxes have subboxes then each of those subboxes can have at most two elements. At every successive level the number of possible conflicts is more than halved.

I think it might be some o(n^x ) where 1&lt;= x &lt;= 2 The reason i express this in this manner is because i am honestly not so interested in pursuing this any longer. If you guys still don't think there is anything to it, then I'm done.

I created a curriculum of 180 credits and I'm thinking in achieve it in 1 year and somethink like two months. I can help you in all you need related to this. I have the schedule, the books, etc.

EDIT 15/04/2017 Link to the curriculum that I made: [MIT CHALLENGE CURRICULUM](http://imgur.com/QwigriC) 

What I did before starting and some tips:
  1) I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. 
   2) Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.
   3) I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.
   4) Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.
  5) I study an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot

Are you suited for this?
*People who is interested in Computer Science
*People with time to learn Computer Science, this may not be a formal degree but you should take it like one
*People with discipline
*People friendly and willing to collaborate
*People wanting to be tech-entrepeneurs

What do you need? *A computer, basically any computer will work. *Time for spend 6-9 hours a day depending on your effort *A good chair to spend those hours *Will!


A little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.

The rules that I made to give some structure (Test mode):

1)12 hours/credit on every subject, MIT recommend 14 hours/credit. Scott H. Young did 6 hours/credit

2) If you don't understand something you may go to a prior subject in order to understand the premise.

3) It is supposed that a subject with 12 credits (like most of them) should be done in 3 weeks, working on them 8 hours monday to friday and 4 hours each day of the weeknd, to a weekly total of 48 hours and a 3 weeks total of 144 hours. If something unexpected happens you can rearrange your time to compensate this in other days, but the total hours should be done in 3 weeks with just a few extraordinary exceptions. It is to be seen if this methodology will work.

4)If Rule #3 is broked, you will have 5 days more to finish the total hours, but with a new total of 14 hours per credit to a total of 168 hours in a 12 credit subject

5) You should have at least 180 credits when you're done (This is what MIT consider a Major). This could be consider that the Major is complete (If there's no a thesis or final project)

6) (It is to be seen if it is possible to have a few days free between the subjects)

7) The general way to test your knowledge will be through the final exam if this is possible. If you fail in this test you will have two days to study for a similar test gain, and this way so on if the resources allowed it. It is to be seen what would happen if the resources are not available.




   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.
Note: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.

Note 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose. ",23,18,False,self,,,,,

Starting last semester, I began doubting my abilities and interest in the field after encountering harder courses and beginning serious searching for summer internships.

I came into college wanting to go into CS and enjoyed the lower level courses that involved learning programming concepts, object oriented programming, basic machine architecture, etc. However, upper level courses, such as Automata Theory, Operating Systems, and advanced architecture, I have found uninteresting and difficult to pay attention in, which is further compounded by the general natural dislike of just sitting in a classroom, listening to a teacher drone on for an hour that I have had since grade school. Other related math classes I have had a similar experience with. 

Applying and interviewing for internships has been stressful, and I am very worried about not getting one for the summer despite not really looking forward to actually doing one. I have to work in the state for 5 years after graduating as a part of a STEM scholarship I have, and I don't know if I can get a job without any relevant experience. I'm applying everywhere I can, since I'm not sure what I would even enjoy doing and just need to try everything. I have aspirations to be a game developer, but that feels too lofty and insecure to be realistic goal, at least in the near future. 

To go along with that, I hate the general culture and lifestyle that seemingly goes along with being a CS major/professional. I know this doesn't apply to everyone, but a large amount of people that I have encountered in my field are overweight, eat poorly, and spend nearly all of their time doing work or projects related to CS. A friend of mine has also expressed similar concerns, has said ""I just don't know if I can just sit in front of a computer for the rest of my life,"" and has considered switching. What he said resonated with me. I am big fan of video games and spend a lot of my lazy time sitting at a computer of TV anyway, but recently I have picked up a number of other hobbies/interests that allow me to step away from the computer, but it often feels wrong that I am doing them. I have become very interested in working out and gaining a better, healthier body, but this can't be done when I need to sit on my ass in a computer lab until midnight to work a computer project that takes an indefinite amount of time. I am living on my own in an apartment, and have really been enjoying learning to cook and make healthy and tasty recipes, but these take time and often I need fast food just to get energy so I can work on some CS homework. I play electric bass and have recently composed music for an orchestra club I help run, but I could've used that time to instead practice coding questions and brush up on my running time complexities and data structures. Fun. 

Hackathons are the pinnacle of what I find wrong with this lifestyle, yet they are talked up as being one of he most important things a CS major can do. Stay up for 24 hours drinking soda and eating junk food while stitching together random APIs for random tech and software and then present it to random company representatives, only for them to say ""Huh. Cool."" Being at hackathons just makes me uncomfortable, as I am surrounded by these overzealous people who give you funny looks for not being interested in the latest CPU of SDK at 2AM when I would much rather be sleeping. I have forced myself to go to these to have at least SOMETHING to talk about and post on my GitHub for interviews, but I never look forward to going to these things. Coding challenge competitions have been better for me, but I am still surrounded by the same kind of people.

I just don't enjoy spending all of my time doing CS related things and want to pursue my other interests. I know that achieving a balance of these things takes time and work, but I find myself getting depressed when I have to sacrifice things like a workout session in order to study for a test or do homework for these classes. 

My current Operating Systems class has pushed my over the edge. I could not care less for the subject material, I hate the professor, the programs take forever, and the guizzes and tests I take just make me angry, and I perform appropriately. I just got a pretty low test grade. My overall and major GPAs(just CS classes) are 3.38 and 3.54 respectively, and the thought of them going down infuriates me, despite my inability to truly put all of my effort into doing well in the course. I am hoping to get into the B range for this course, but it just makes me feel terrible when I see these peers talk about their seemingly flawless grades. So many professors have said ""Grades don't matter in CS,"" and yet my peers love to flaunt them. I try to make grades not be the end all be all of my self worth, and yet a bad quiz or test grade brings me to my boiling point.  I surprisingly enjoy my Data and Design Algorithms class, and I am taking a cool Multimedia Systems class, and am doing well in both, so at least I am definitely still doing well overall. But again, I don't feel like pursuing more relevant information outside of what I am learning in those courses.

I just feel all of this pressure to do so many things that I don't feel like I signed up for with this major. I enjoy the act of coding and creating working elegant programs, but I hate low level architecture as well as really high level abstract concepts. I don't even want to imagine the idea of switching majors at this point, as the reaction from my parents and the prospect of doing even more school to switch makes me depressed. I feel like I don't belong at times, but I don't even have any idea of what I would do otherwise. I am on track to graduate a semester early, but I am considering getting a minor in math to fill in that extra semester and graduate on time. I don't know if it would be better for me to graduate early or do the minor for whatever the minor would be worth in the future.

I'm just rambling at this point, thank you for reading if you did, and sorry for posting something pretty negative about CS in a sub that is generally really positive about the field. ",7,24,False,self,,,,,

I tell them mostly because I love programming, and I want the degree. To answer a lot of people's thoughts and concerns about computer science and math. So first off, yes. You will need to learn math in order to major in computer science. To major in ANY science, usually you have to have a decent amount of math into it. My program requires 4 math courses. Some may do more, some may do less. It really depends where you go to school.  You're earning a degree in science, you're going to do math. 

However, don't let that scare you away just yet. Computer science is a very very broad term that people throw around. When people say computer science they typically mean programming which is not all that computer science entails. For instance, there is networking, hardware technology, your standard ""it"". That's all computer science. I'm going to assume most of you are pursuing programming. Programming is very strange when it comes to the job force. Some places will hire you without a degree if your portfolio is really THAT good. Sometimes that's even preferred. I mention this, because some self-taught people haven't cracked open a math book since high school.  So to know programming, you don't have to be a mathematician. 

If you're going to be a programmer, you may or may not use math, and if you do, most of the math you do is already written and posted onto stack overflow. However, getting that degree you are going to get your head beat with math. While you probably will NEVER use calculus or never manually convert words into binary and vice versa (most languages come with built in functions that do it for you ^.^) you still will be taught that in your curriculum. So don't flip out, and just take each class as it comes at you. There are SOOOO many more CS classes you will have to endure than your 2-4 math classes. So just be patient",15,6,False,self,,,,,
