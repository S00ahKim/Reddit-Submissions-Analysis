2,2015-2-2,2015,2,2,13,2uhemx,Hi /r/computerscience! New here and I have a question that's been keeping me up for days. Wondering if you lovely people could help?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2uhemx/hi_rcomputerscience_new_here_and_i_have_a/,DanbiNabi,1422851712,"I have an idea for a startup website/company that will be very service-orientated and have been wondering how GPS integration works with websites. I have very limited working knowledge of HTML/CSS &amp; Javascript. Most of it was self-taught via books and Code Academy. Currently, I am still teaching myself these concepts but am hitting a wall in terms of practical applications/usages for the service I want to create. 

For example, let's say Customer A searched up nearby individuals within the area. Customer A finds an individual to assist with his or her problem utilizing Google Maps or any other map program to assist with the search. Customer A then proceeds to contact the individual and the individual is prompted via email or notification.

This system would somewhat be similar to CraigsList or Uber's service. However, there would not be any kind of live updates on the map, you would just see an registered user on the map with his/her contact information and perhaps a review system? How does this work in terms of coding? What is required?

My idea is still in it's infancy as I am trying to decide how profitable it will be in the future. I apologize for being vague, but at the time I don't really want to expose anything until a solid foundation is established. 

I appreciate everyone's time and input! ",6,3

I'm a computer science major, and I really want to take a 'Probability in Computing' course at my college during the summer (so I can graduate early), but am unsure of myself to be honest. I am not the best of students, and I've only been able to manage a B average in the three introductory courses I have taken so far (all of which I've struggled in). I don't want to take the class (which is six weeks long, 8 hours a week), fail, and waste $2500.

I'm planning on discussing the difficulty of the course with a number of comp sci advisors and professors, and if they think I can pass, but that's all next week, so I would like to gather some thoughts from those who have taken courses similar to this. :D

I would also like to know if, as the question posed at the beginning asks, there are helpful resources (online, textbook, etc.) that I could potentially use as a supplement for the class. Of course it's impossible to tell if these resources will be of use, but it's nice to feel prepared haha.

I've been working on a company for the past 2.6 years. It hasn't taken off yet, and six months ago I realized why. I'm far too focused on my vision and I require a strong goal-driven personality to make my immediate vision come to fruition so that I can eventually drive the bigger goal. In other words, I need a Mark Cuban to my Elon Musk (not to sound pretentious, it's just the best analogy I could think of). That said, I think I've finally found him, and things have only been moving forward since. What is my bigger goal? To give computers a sense of [""qualia""](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/).

I'm including my background so that you know who I am, can take my experience with the salt needed, and because I understand that while not every good discussion starts with a PhD, it's important to recognize those who have one and to note that I do not have one.

###Skip to the heading below if you don't give a crap about my background.
####(I wont blame you if you do not care)

My company is in the field of computer vision. I've always taken a shine to computer vision, even though I phoned in most of my assignments in university. I just felt it was an amazing field that has incredible potential. However, since my computer vision classes in university in 2006, I have learned quite a bit. 

My college background was quite........ esoteric. I only graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science, but I graduated with over 160 credits. In fact, I was very very close to having a minor in Philosophy if it weren't for the fact I talked my advisor into counting a philosophy credit to count towards a senior computer science credit (he wasn't wrong in doing so, the class was the most amazing computer science class I ever took and it wasn't even geared towards computer scientists).

In my first job in/out of college (I worked full time my last 22 credits), they asked me to do something weird. This was a start up. A small company. They had a BIG problem. They identified online content which had a ""call to action"" that violated a set guideline as being infringing content, traditional advertisements or not. I, from scratch, built their entire advertisement auditing system. However, many advertisements were the same across several web pages, and many of them were not what one would consider your typical advertisement. If you intercepted a web page and there were what are known as ""calls to action"" on that same web page, this meant the page itself was one big advertisement. The problem they had was that TONS of these websites existed at the time, and we had no way of grouping these advertisements under the same ""this is THIS category of advertisement"". We wanted to group them based on the call to action and the web page template, but all I could determine was the call to action.

So they assigned me with an asinine task. I was to take top-to-bottom screenshots of web pages, automatically, and determine if they were using the same general template of another web page, based on screenshot alone and regardless of the content in the webpage (which varied). Then, from those screenshots, I was to categorically group the discovered advertisements in our reports. The screenshots weren't the problem. The problem was, they wanted carrier-grade (five 9's or 99.999%) accuracy. 

So here I am, barely out of college, asked to do a computer vision task that, frankly, my computer vision teacher told me to quit my job immediately if ever asked to do. I said no, and of course, was told to do it anyway. So I pulled up phash.org, used their algorithms, and spent a month and a half showing them that it was mathematically impossible for us to do the number of comparisons they needed to figure this out automatically given the resources I had. After that I proved that even if we did have the resources, it would only get an at-best 65% accuracy. We  needed to find another way. Not soon after, I did, but it had nothing to do with computer vision.

When they finally conceded, it was a huge relief, however, it wasn't as though this problem was done in my head. 

I started to wonder: why could a person do this better than a computer?

This is what got me into computer vision: specifically perceptual hashing. So I devoted what little spare time I had (80 hour weeks for a start up is draining), and wound up discovering a thing!

Ultimately, that's what my company strives to do, only with video. I figured out a fantastic system for perceptually hashing video on a per-frame basis that out-performs all human auditing. And it is fault tolerant (watermarking, subtitles, distortion, resolution, frame rate change, frame skipping, flipping, and rotation). And it scales! And it stores in a fixed calculable size depending only on the length of the video. And it's adjustable. And it is accurate! 

That's beside the point, though. All this is intending to do is to establish myself as a person who has a bit of background on content similarity.

###You would have skipped to here if you didn't care about my background.

####So here comes the rant-esque portion of my writing. I'm not trying to put anyone down. I'm not trying to discourage advancement. I just want you to know, there's a pretty clear path towards the goal of artificial intelligence and people are ignoring it. 

People think of ""seeing"", ""hearing"", ""touching"", ""feeling"", and ""smelling""  as different tasks. I am going to tell you, flat out, they are not. Things, to a human, can look ""soft"". They can look ""rough"". They can look ""loud"". They can look ""smelly"". 

All of our senses as humans are cross-related? Why is that? Is that something that's unique to the human experience?

I don't believe so. The answer to this is very much related to something.... our common experience. Regardless of our linguistic inclination, if you were to say to a foreigner that something looks ""hard"", he wont associate that with something that is easy to push around, manipulate, bend, tort, or move. He will understand, through inference, that you mean this is a difficult thing to do.

**So why is it that we keep trying to teach computers to think for us if we do not first try to teach them to understand us?**

This is where the unproven hypothesis comes in. 

We continue to pursue the ""fields"" of artificial intelligence, but we fail to understand the core of what it means to be intelligent **to us**. What do I mean? Well simply put, the fields are not wrong in their ultimate goals, but focusing on those goals will get us nowhere unless we understand the basic definition of core *humanity*.

Why are humans so exceptionally good at the most astounding things? We invented the very computers we work with every single day to make our jobs easier. What's stopping us from building a computer which is our equal? Is it computational power? Yes, somewhat, but that's not all. Just because we do not have the computational power does not mean we are moving in the right direction in artificial intelligence.

And truth be told, we're not.

It's not about feigned empathy.

It's not about identifying road patterns.

It's not about distinguishing two videos or songs as the same.

It's not about understanding what people really ""mean"" by language.

It's not about Asimov's three laws.

There is a pretty clear process to the entire path to developing true artificial intelligence, and we are not working on the **most basic part**. We need to give computers a sense of [qualia](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/) before all else.

###The clear path to artificial intelligence.

So before I go on the merits of qualia, let me outline what I think this clear path is.

####Significant Leap #1. Teach a computer to experience ([qualia](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/)) 

This is the step we have not conquered yet, and it's the most difficult one. The truth is that unless we give computers a shared experience to go off of, none of the fuzzy behavior of reality will make sense. We can joke about optical illusions for humans, but if a computer experiences the same thing, that's somehow unacceptable. Truth be told, a computer should have its own brand of illusions, and that needs to derive from its own shared experience. Unless a computer devises a sense of ""qualia"", it will be unable to truly ""learn"" anything. It's no more intelligent than a parrot saying, 'Hello.' In fact, it might be worse.

####Significant Leap #2. Teach a computer to question

This is an amazing step because it's a quantum leap compared to what we've really done so far. At this point, our software is very specialized. If you want a computer to ask a question, it's typically based on questions it was previously told to ask. It's limited. Once a computer has a sense of [qualia](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/), though, it can doubt its own surroundings. It can ask questions, ""Is this thing that like thing?"" Or even, ""How is this thing different from that thing?"" This is much like a child would behave. If it asks these questions, then it's learning... much in the same way human children take years learning.

####Significant Leap #3. Teach a computer to wonder

Holy cow! What if a computer could take all of its learned experiences and information based on pure questioning alone and start to ... wonder about the future? How would that change things? Then we would have turned our experience machine into an inquisitor machine into a dreamer or, even better, an inventor. That's the key to computational advancement. The other two steps could easily be performed by equal human effort, but when a computer is able to wonder about that which isn't? Then we're really ready to progress the human species to the next level.

####Significant Leap #4. Teach a computer to take leaps of faith

This is a strange one to put in here, I'm sure. Most of you might be like me, where the word ""faith"" is typically a dirty word. However, in the context of epistemology, ""faith"" in its colloquial sense is very much necessary. Computers tend to rely on a sense of dependable inputs and dependable outputs. While a computer may have learned that things aren't always correct in the previous ""significant leaps,"" it hasn't learned the value of incorrectness. This means that it has the ability to wonder, but not to ponder. It cannot determine if the course of action it had previously taken was appropriate or not. As such, a computer prior to this point is incapable of true trial and error, and as such, is incapable of deriving any absolute empirical knowledge. After this point, we've created the scientist computer. 

This is the point where computers could become dangerous. We're not even close to this point, tough. We'll reference Asimov if this time comes.

####Significant Leap #5. Teach a computer some friggin' judgement

So now it can experience the world, question it, wonder about possibilities, make leaps towards solutions, and now we need it to make some damn judgement calls. 

Think about it. Prior to this point the computer has developed the intellect of a [tween](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tween_%28demographic%29).

The baby phase is experiences, then it develops a toddler's curiosity, then it begins the ability to predict and measure its own actions like a 5-8 year old, and next it's jumping to conclusions.

The only factor distinguishing it's value from that of an adult human is it's ability to make (hopefully good) judgement calls. 

At the point it can do this, we're looking at a new life form of our own creation. How fantastic is that!?!

###So what's your point, Rafajafar?

It's simple. We are doing a top-down approach to developing the field of artificially intelligent machines. While I'm ok with top-down in certain circumstances, I have to wonder why we're doing it in the most important field of computer science. Oh wait, no I don't... it's because the world demands **immediate results**, and this approach **will not lead to immediate results**. It will, instead, lead to **real results**. Unfortunately, they will only come over time and our collective mind insists that the bottom line be calculated the next quarter in advance.

So my point is: If you really care about artificial intelligence... open source a ""qualia"" machine. Nothing else. Because at this point, we don't even have that.

However, I'm now at that point where it's Grad School or Job.

Problem is that CS is so broad, and so interesting, I'm having a hard time narrowing it down.  Honestly, the more research I do the MORE things that seem like I'd enjoy doing them, and it's starting to wear on me.

Honestly, I think my ideal position, vocationally, would be a consultant, as while I find coding fun, I kind of prefer to work in abstracts and enjoy assisting other people in finding solutions rather than the type of person that likes tinkering with gadgets directly... but that doesn't mean I wouldn't thrive or enjoy a job contrary to such a position, and so I really don't know.

Complicate this with a reflexive habit of analyzing UX and design, and I'm really just drowning in a sea of options and I have no idea what to do.

This would be all well and good if money was my goal, at which point job would be the obvious, but since I only need enough to live, the stipend from a TA or RA position that's all but guaranteed for a CS degree...

I don't have any idea how to even narrow down my choices, and it'd be wonderful to be able to get some sense of how to move forward, because I'm afraid I'm going to either make the wrong choice either in job field or in not going to grad school, or going to grad school for the wrong thing (and thusly not be at a university supporting that goal)

TL;DR  

* I want to start grad school. But I have some problems.  
* I didnt network enough (with students or professors).  
* I wasnt focused enough on my studies during undergrad.  
* I think after working in the industry for 2 years now, I can better appreciate time I spend in school. I have a solid  
portfolio of personal projects and research.  
* Unfortunately, my GPA is on the low side (3.15).  
* I think getting a few LOR from academia will be like pulling teeth since I didnt give my professors the opportunity to really appreciate my abilities.  
* My academic life feels weak, incomplete, and severely lacking. I want to fix this.  
 
  

***** 

  
 
I graduated from a very average state university in 2013 and did very average in most of my courses, in my CS courses I maintained about a 3.15 GPA. 

I think the reason for this low GPA was the amount of time I poured into my personal research/projects rather than my school work. I do consider myself more knowledgable than my typical peer (or did at the time, before we left school and our skillsets diverged). I say this because I was consistently aware of and applied ideas, theories, methodologies years before my peers and I covered them in our courses, and I already had several years of experience before I started the program. However, during undergrad I think its clear I suffered from a discipline problem.

As a result, I didnt do much networking, I didnt work very closely (or generally get to know) my professors, and sometimes I would get cocky and think I didnt need to study like my peers did. I think out of all of the mistakes I made in undergrad, that was the most damaging.

Immediately after graduation I secured a position at a research company (essentially a well-funded startup) specializing in artificial intelligence. I had been eyeballing its parent company for over 7 years before I applied. Im doing well in this position and am making decent money. But I want to pursue a more advanced degree.

Now, my question is if we can assume I do now have the skills/discipline to succeed in academia, how should I go about bootstrapping or jumpstarting my dead academic life?

Im thinking my best options are to move back to my previous small town and re-attempt academia with a more responsible attitude. Or try to stick it out here in CA and find my next school. Possibly starting with another state school or community college and transferring once I can demonstrate that Im not a waste of time.

I appreciate any help! Thanks!",4,5

Ever since I was a little kid, I've been fascinated by computers and how things work. I'd always ask my parents questions that they couldn't answer about how certain things would work and I've always found myself asking ""Why?"" and questioning things.

Somewhere before I was 10 years old, I received my first computer. I didn't have to ask how to use it, how to open applications, or anything. I just picked it up as if I've always known. From there, my forever expanding knowledge of computers grew and grew. Very rapidly, I got to the point where my dad and my whole family would have to ask me for computer help, rather than the reverse.

Somewhere in the middle of when I 10, I was also introduced to [ROBLOX](http://corp.roblox.com/), a kids game based on creating and using your imagination that kinda simulates real world. Almost immediately after discovering ROBLOX, I discovered their [ROBLOX Studio](http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php/Studio), which also introduced me to the Lua programming language. Soon after, I learned and mastered Lua as my first programming language.

Years went by, I perfected my Lua skills, and stuff happened. I tried learning (but never mastered) many languages including Ruby, C, C#, C++, Objective-C, SQL, JavaScript, Swift, Haskell, Python, and Boo. I suppose the main reason for skipping around was the lack of motivation to stick to the learning. After ""experimenting"", I decided to revisit C++. I got pretty far into learning, but randomly lost motivation, and stopped. I then revisited Ruby, being intrigued by ""everything is an object!"" and it's nice syntax. I finished learning the syntax of it, and could write my own full programs. But now I'm drifting away from Ruby in favor of Java.

Currently, I'm trying to learn Java (still trying to find a definite source to learn it from - 5 USD short from being able to buy the Sams Teach Yourself book on iBooks ): ). I absolutely love Javadoc and that it implements WORA (write once, run anywhere).

When I was in 6th grade, I became aware of college and how all of that works. The second I found out Computer Science existed, I knew instantly that's what I want to major in.

Now, I'm in high school. My end goal is to earn a doctorate or professorship in Computer Science. I know Lua and Ruby (but drifting away from Ruby), and I'm going to master Java (this time, I have motivation). I'm also going to take the Computer Programming class at my school next year, but since I don't know who the teacher is and can't find out about the class through the Guidance department, I'm guessing they'll be teaching C#.

What is some advice some of you CS majors could give me so I could pursue my dream? Will CS be hard with the background knowledge I already have? Do you know of a place where I could learn Java? What should I do to prepare myself?

All advice is welcome, and sorry for all that text!

P.S. I'm somewhat hard-working and a bit of a procrastinator, but I'm trying my best to fix those problems.",16,5

I can think logically and think I have the brain for programming, I'm also good at memorizing things such as code. 

Thing is, got no experience programming. I know basic css and HTML. I also have made games in Gamesalad (iphone app creator) where it's not really writing code but using blocks of code. But I for some reason found it really easy to think logically, while all my class mates couldn't.

But yeah I know I should've started coding through highschool, but I pursued graphic design instead. But I guess now I'm really good at Graphic Design now.

THING IS, I don't love math. I don't like the idea of sitting in a class and learning plain math.

There seems to be 3 math classes in the first year alone.

Like I'm above average at math and pretty good for my class, BUT I don't do extension maths. I don't do the lowest math, but the middle (advanced) right now in highschool. I should've done the next level up they say, because it's assumed knowledge.

But yeah, I'm not a math wiz. I'm not one of those kids who's naturally amazing and loves maths.

I feel like I'm an all-rounder sort of person, who doesn't amazingly excel at one subject, except for multimedia (graphic design, video all that stuff etc.) and biology. 

I dunno, but I have no idea what else to do?

I always thought my destiny was ""to work with computers"" as 9 year old me would tell everyone if they asked. Which I still feel it is. I love the idea that programming and computer science is modern, technology orientated and is ever evolving and growing - which is what I wanted in a job.

The computer was overloaded with incoming data, because the rendezvous radar system (not necessary for landing) updated an involuntary counter in the computer, which stole cycles from the computer. Due to its robust architecture, the computer was able to keep running; the Apollo onboard flight software was developed using an asynchronous executive so that higher priority jobs (important for landing) could interrupt lower priority jobs. Initially, the fault had been attributed to a faulty checklist and the radar being erroneously activated by the crew, but a 2005 re-analysis concluded that a hardware design error in the rendezvous radar provided the computer with faulty information even while in standby mode.[9]

Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.""

This is roughly what I had in mind:
A few questions on computer architecture. E.g. Difference between Von Newmann and Harvard Architecture. What's an ALU and program counter?
Maybe a few questions on assembly since they all seem to have studied it. 

A few questions on data structures. What's the difference between a stack, queue, and heap? Where might you use each of those? Get them to implement one in pseudo code. See if they do it as a linked list or array, and ask a few questions about their implementation. 

A few questions on sorting algorithms. Can they name a few. See what they know about their relative speeds. Get them to implement one of them in pseudo code. 

A few questions on OOP.
What is it? What are the advantages? Can they list a few object orientated languages. What is a class, an object, inheritance etc.

Does that sound about the right sort of level of questions? Too hard/easy? Any extra questions that might be suitable?",7,2

I am more than willing to put in the hard work but don't know where to find good tools to help me learn. I just don't have any resources. What REALLY helped you guys along the way? Im mpstly referring to the non gifted ones who like me, a former bio major, had no clue what computer science was.Any advice on books, websites, lists of important things to know, tips on success...ANYTHING. I need to be better and failure is not a choice. The stress is killing me.

Which is that , computer science will teach you what computers can do(theoretically), which is beneficial for a developer. If not please explain the right view.
-Second,my goal is to become an amazing developer, by learning the underlying principles.(work in sillicon valley- no matter how crazy expensive it is) Unless I find I can do something else more exciting with CS. I don't want to be a maintance keeper type at say like some data base or a research guy. I want to create something new.
-Third, I plan on learning the subject not from college (have you seen tuition these days?) But from lots of books recommended by you guys (yeah the good old fashion way :3), YouTube videos and playlists, websites, and apps.
My sources to learn from so far are: How computers work by Ron White, But how do it know by J. Clark Scott, Lynda.com, Khanacademy.com, codeschool.org.
- Fourth, I know face interaction is invaluable but I just don't have the monetary resources to go to college.
-&gt; Can anyone  build me a college equivalent curriculum (preferably that of a ivy leagues school) and point out the resources where to learn that from. (Such as the amazing books and websites above- not like code academy.com or treehouse.com because I want to learn underlying principles mainly of how it all works and then learn the easy coding stuff from code academy and treehouse etc.) Resources like not widely known but amazingly thorough such as specific websites, YouTube channels, YouTube playlists, textbooks, anything really. Or if someone can guide me or organize some MOOCs, I find them unorganized and useless unless you have background knowledge,and materials are sometimes missing&lt;--
 Also if you can guide me in the right direction as to what to expect from what field in Computer Science. (Pay,what I'll be doing etc.)
 Anything else I'm not aware of that I should know and expect from computer science?
P.s. I'm very interested in Robotics and AI too",4,0

Im going to be attempting to get my Degree in Computer Science hoping to be some sort of programmer, however i have one problem...im not a master at my craft.  

My High School had some serious problems with their Programming and Computer classes due to our teacher being old and being at the end of her career. We had to essentially skip a year due to her bad health and we recently switched teachers for the final year (AP course), so everyone's at different levels of knowledge and experience. Im at the bad end. I understand the basics and i can write simple code, however some newer lessons are very hard for me and because im further behind, it's up to me to catch up.  

The point of this is to simply ask, how extensive does my knowledge have to be to start off my goal of a Computer Science degree? Will the first set of classes be for novices and explain the basics of the craft? Or will i be expected to already be able to program at a specific level?

I mean the only thing we have to look forward to is a console output that just adds numbers or something. But another thing that bothers me is that it seems that most CS jobs aren't doing things you feel passionate about, but instead just maintaining other people's code or fixing broken crapplets for a company because the guy who made it hated his job and designed it terribly. I kinda understand why there are so many people who despite the ire of most CS forums, want to go into game design, because it's something that interests them more than whatever other real world job they've seen that is CS related. Another fear I have is that the job place for CS is too cold or not very social. I also dislike the whole idea of before getting a job, people say you need to contribute to random github projects you don't care about at all. Are jobs stable or do you need to freelance allot?

But that's a bit too judgemental for me I think, and I'm certain many people here may have had a very positive experience with this field. So maybe I should start with my interests. I am good at math, have always liked technology, especially computers and of course video games like most people my age. I also have a mild interest in cybersecurity, city design, sociology, and story writing. I don't like biology or unapplied classes. I'd say I've always been best at STEM oriented courses ever since elementary school (l liked Discrete Math, very different and interesting).

But now that I think more of it, I realized I don't care about software, and find most of it to be bloaty or cumbersome or unnecessary. Maybe I wouldn't be able to enjoy coding for something I don't care about. Maybe a more hard oriented approach would be better, I think find coding too abstract or just a means to an end. 

What does this sound like to you? Also, sorry for dumping a spaghetti of thoughts onto here, I was thinking r/STEM but decided here is better. I hope this is the right place.

But I'm thinking, if I ever want to do something that involves science as well as computer science... I'll need to have some sort of knowledge of science right? Especially with AI, neuroscience would come in handy? I dunno?

Thing is, I'm really interested in the brain and like science as well. But I'm not going to do it just because I like it, I want it to be useful and relevant.

I was looking at the bioinformatics degree, but I felt that would limit me to much to that side... I want to keep my options open for all areas of computer science. 

So do you think I should do a science degree along with my computer science degree? I will probably major in neuroscience.",6,4
