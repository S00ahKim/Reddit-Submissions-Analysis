I was asked to create a map for a tour company. It needs to include routes for attractions. 

I need to digitise the given map.

Two options to do so:

The first class, Essentials of Computer Programming is only available to juniors, but my guidance counselor told me that she saw a passion for computers within me, and got the principal to make an exception for me. I've always had a love for computers, and this class is the only class where I love the homework. I'm actually three lessons ahead of everyone else in the class. Now that I've found my passion, what do I do with it? I was a career involving computers that makes good money, but I also have an interest in computer engineering. I should also mention that because of my talent in this, the school has elected me to become the front-runner of the robotics program they're starting next semester. We're leaving for Texarkana, AR to pick up our very first robot and I get to be the first to learn about it. I feel truly blessed for all that they're doing for me, and I don't want to put all of this to waste. I know it's very early to be deciding this, but what career should I go into? I have a 4.0 GPA and am in our school's GT program. I feel like I would have a good chance attending MIT. Is that the right path for me? Also, is there anyway I could put my skills to use while I'm in high school?

I am homeschooled and wish to begin studying 12 hours a day.  Because I don't yet know specifically what area I wish to focus on, I want to gain a broad understanding of all concepts before I enter University at 18.  

How would you guys recommend I divvy up the 12 hours daily?  Ie: how many hours spent writing code, how many hours reading, what languages, what topics, etc.  Keep in mind I'm not interested in working with hardware although I do wish to understand the basics, and as of now my knowledge is so rudimentary I couldn't set up a router.  By 17 I want to know enough to understand all tech conversations in the news, know how cookies, servers, and Ip adresses work, understand security vulnerabilities ie whats possible to exploit on an unprotected WiFi, etc.

I would like to stay in the area, so I'm basically looking at UBC's BCS program, and 2nd degree/masters at UW and WWU. 

I've read some posts where some redditors are discouraging people from bypassing the undergrad CS, citing the essential foundations it offers. While I've also read some people disputing that and saying that a masters will be more beneficial for job prospects immediately. 

What I like about the BCS program is that it's only 2 years, but from what I've read, is pretty intensive. 

A. If I did a second undergrad at UW or WWU, roughly how long would it take to complete? 

B. What is the reputation of the UW and WWU programs? 

C. Masters programs usually require some foundational courses, if not a CS degree. Could those foundational courses be sufficient to enter a Masters?

I was offered an internship at JPMorgan for the position of Tech Analyst Intern, however the title is throwing me off a little bit. I wanted more of a software engineery type internship, but the title for the internship suggests otherwise. 

However, the then other curveball is that the description for the internship from my school's career services site (where I applied for the on campus interview) suggests that it could potentially be a full on software developer position that I would want.

Here is what the description for the job says:

&gt;Theres not a single part of our business that isnt powered and enhanced by the creative thinking of our technologists and the industry-leading solutions they provide. Join us and youll work alongside and learn from some of the brightest minds in the industry across our consumer, wholesale and corporate businesses. Whether you are a Software Developer or Infrastructure Engineer, youll ensure our technology continues to be a competitive advantage for the firm.
The 10-week summer program starts with a robust orientation session. After that, youll have a mentor to support and advise you through the program. And to cap it all off, youll be invited to attend senior speaker series and a whole host of other exclusive events to meet colleagues and senior leaders to develop your professional network. Youll also have the chance to join us full-time after successful completion of the summer internship and upon graduation.
In Software Development, you will have the ability to work across the complete life cycle from analysis to development, testing and implementation. Youll gain an understanding of business challenges and needs across the firm, learn to develop smart and secure technology solutions, and innovate to create best-in-class user experiences, processes, products and applications.
In Infrastructure Engineering, you will participate in the development of high-performance infrastructure service offerings to help build and manage some of the firms largest and most complex business initiatives. You will engage in the design and development of innovative computer, storage, and networking solutions on platforms such as those used for trading or credit card processing with unparalleled scale and complexity.

I dropped out of university in my second year mainly due to drinking and lack of focus. Recently, reality has been sinking in and I am beginning to reach that point where I need to go back to school and choose a career. 

I have never touched computer science in my life, however I have completed all of my high schools math and sciences. I fear that since I have been out of school for so long, my math will be terrible and I won't be able to keep up. I know CS can pay well after graduating and I do find myself intrigued by the idea as I am generally on my computer everyday.

I am wondering if there is any tutorials, videos, or anything at all that I can use to learn the basics of coding and get me started. I don't want to go into this blind and I feel like if I know nothing going it I am going to be 10 steps behind.

*Would love feedback!*

*Thanks if you read!*

PS: Don't know if this has anything to do with coding, but my only experience would be making Warcraft 3 maps when I was a kid ;)

TL;DR: Don't know anything about CS and need direction.

But need some help.

Specifically I want to show the proportionality between path length and tree width.

To start: any algorithmic process can be unrolled as a 'series of steps'.

**Constant time algorithms** have k steps, and asymptotic analysis means we can reduce this path to one vertex. Cost = # leaves in our tree OR path length = O(1)


**Linear algorithms** are like paths of length n (loop with one iteration). Another way to show this is a tree with n branches of depth one. Trivially, the tree width ~ path length and they both linearly with n.
Cost = O(n)


**Polynomial algorithms** are like a path length n which contains nested loops of length n on each node (but we limit the nesting depth to some constant k). This can also be viewed as a tree with n branches and depth k. Again path length ~ # leaves in the tree. O(n^k)


**Exponential algorithms** are like a path length of k which contains nested loops of length k, but this time we allow the nesting to go on n times. This is the same as a tree with k branches and depth n. Path length ~ tree width are again proportional. O(k^n)


Finally you can go on and allow a path of length n with nesting depth n, which is like a tree with n branches and n depth, and this is O(n^n). I like this visual...


So I'd want to show people that most problems (including those in P) have exponential solution spaces (i.e. algorithmic process must growth in depth). And these are all ""trivial to brute force"", but the space gets too large too fast to practically solve.  So the *role of algorithms at a high level is to trim/shunt this growth*. 

When we take a problem in NP and reduce it to a P then we are essentially finding a pattern that allows us to prevent our algorithms from growing in depth (which we can view as tree depth or nested loop depth). With problems in P we can always do this (find an algorithm which doesn't grow in depth)...with problems in NP, we aren't sure if we can always do this. And we assume we can't.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Normally each code we write for our lab assignments is very similar to what we do in class. For example, in class we will learn how to copy and put 3 pictures side by side and for our assignment it would be something like put 3 pictures on top of each other instead.
