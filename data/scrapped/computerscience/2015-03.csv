It's really disheartening. 

1. How would I know whether a problem would be solved by DP or Greedy ? In textbooks they always give an instance / example where greedy results in an sub-optimal solution, whereas DP yields an optimal solution. But, how do I figure this out in a real world situation ? You can't expect someone to implement code trying a greedy and DP strategy and seeing which one gave the best answer can you ?

2. I am more comfortable with attempting a bottom-up solution right of the bat (via iteration) and always have difficultly coming up with recursive solution, specially the exit condition of the recursion. How /what should I practice to think top-down about solving a problem ?

3. I know the most important thing to do in DP is to identifying overlapping problem and then optimal substructure. But I just can't get a handle on these two, properties. When I am given a completely new problem in DP I can't come up with the two things. If I come up with something, it's wrong. Is there a science behind find them out or is it just intuition and I am just cursed and I should give up trying to master DP ?

4. What are some of the things you think about why coming up with optimal solutions for a problem in general, how do you know that what you have hit upon is optimal for sure ? What's the thought process like for coming up with such a solution ?

So I'm a Norwegian high school student on my secound of three years at the  school. I've for a long time searched for a suitable career for myself, and I've decided that I preforably would like a line of work where I acctually can point at something and say ""this excists in the world because of me."" Does that make sense? Computer science and engineering sounds like the two most suitable ways of studiuing for me, but here's the catch.

In Norwegian schools you can take three types of math. P-math (which is basically useless), S-math (the secound most difficult math, with it you can study medicin, analytical economics and computer science) an R-maths (hardest math, required for all engineering and arcitechture). Of these three I chose S-math and I have the grade of 5 (equals a B) in it.

To study informatikk (computer-science) you are required to have taken S-math which I have. To study dataingenir (computer engineering) you are required to take R-maths and physics 1 and 2, for which I shall only take physics 1. I've heard that these lines of studie are quite similar. Will my lack of knowledge within maths and physics mean that, though I reach the requirements, I will not sucseed within computer science?

All answers are appreciated

Ps; I no this is difficult to answe, so if you canot, could you try to give me an idea of how difficult the math is?

Pps; I believe my English is understandable, but a bit ""ogg,"" something I aploagize for :)

In doing some prep-study for a job interview with google, they recommend knowing about adjacency matrices (along with node-pointer and adjacency list graph representations) and so I though ""golly, they must be really important!"" Except that I have had a difficult time finding algorithms that use them! In fact, aside from dijkstra (which has better time and space complexity when NOT using matrices), they seem to have no use besides constant time lookup of whether two specific nodes share an edge, but relatively poor performance at finding what edges a node has.

But they have some interesting properties: If M is the adjacency matrix, it may also represent all paths of length one. M^2 happens to represent all paths of length two. M^3 ... length three, etc.. The PDF I found this tidbit on (sorry, I don't have a link) described this as ""non-constructive"" because knowing that a path exists doesn't tell us how to get from point a to point b. Though I wonder... if a path, a-&gt;b, has a length three (is in M^3), then M^2 must contain an entry a-&gt;x, where x-&gt;b is in M. Then a-&gt;y must be in M such that y-&gt;x is in M. We get a-&gt;y-&gt;x-&gt;b. In other words, it seems to me like one should be able to devise a shortest path algorithm with this information. Granted, it would require n-cubed space and time so it may not be entirely practical. Still, it would benefit from cache locality (all the info being in the matrix, not random pointers), algorithmic simplicity (comparatively), and if the powers of M were pre-calculated, it would likely perform much better than n-cubed.

And from an online class in matrices and linear algebra, I learned that many abstract problems can be solved using vector-matrix equations, although solutions are not always unique. For example, it talks about how [lights out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_%28game%29) can be solved by using matrix-vector multiplication (see [wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LightsOutPuzzle.html)). I'm not sure how the path or nodes would be represented, but I wonder if path-finding couldn't be seen as a matrix multiplication problem.

So I have a few ideas of things I'd like to look into, but I need to keep on studying so I probably won't have time to implement either of these. Does this sound like an algorithm I apparently haven't heard of? Is there a flaw in my logic? ",6,1,False,self,,,,,

Berkeley is a great choice but attending school would have some opportunity costs that may not be worth it in the long run.

My biggest worry is that I'll get my degree and lack a good position to enter the workforce. Think some miserable cubicle job doing menial coding day after day (taking your lumps is one thing, being in a dead end position is another). I'm 32 with no professional experience so I already feel very behind. My original goal was to go to school for the degree and the exposure to the different parts of computer science and work on side projects in the meantime - side projects which I believe will teach me more then anything I'll learn in a classroom. So I worry that if I focus too much on my school I'll miss out on the more important things I should be doing.

So this is where I'm at - go to the more 'prestigious' school or a more convenient one that'll let me focus on other things for the next two years.

The thing I love about coding is that your skills matter more then some pedigree in this field. Going to a mediocre school and improving my skills on the side or going to a better school that offers more opportunities (internships, etc.).

I really need advice here people, and this is by far the best vehicle I have to get a solid answer. Please don't guess. If you don't know because you don't have that kind of experience, I can speculate as well as anyone (but thanks anyway!).    

I'm wondering what I can be doing to bridge the gap between the skills I will have as a graduate and the skills I will need as a fresh faced professional? I read a lot about there being this difference between what we do as undergrads and graduate students, and what people who work professionally in CS do. It's always a little nebulous because it usually speaks to this idea that it's just about assimilating a new company's entire information structure, which makes sense, because I recognize that there are certain things that are going to be job specific, and that those things may be somewhat difficult to predict given that they are based on the circumstances relative to that position. That being said, I'm guessing that it's not **all** that, and there might be some things I can be honing in the meantime to make myself a better employee. So, *in general*, are there skill sets I can be developing to hit the ground running as fast as possible once I become ""on the market"" as an employee? I'm talking mostly about programming, but anyone from any field in CS who wants to reply is more than welcome because I'm also not sure I wanna code for the rest of my life, or at least be *limited* to that.

I'm a undergraduate in computer engineering (2nd year) and, besides the stuff we study at school, I'd like to learn more things (for example I'd like to learn the computer arch and network basics in-depth for a long time now). Now, I am between these two choices: 1) I learn a few stuff at a day, all days, steadily. (i.e. 3-4 pages per day of a book) 2) I put apart what I'd like to learn, because maybe it's more effective to learn things with more time in the future and. So first get graduated, then, in some way or another, start to learn what I want to learn (besides the school's stuff).

From your own experience, what's better? Do you usually learn a bit of a time or do you try to wait when you have more spare time and learn more things per day (for example take a one-month-full-reading)? I fear that when I'll graduate, I'll get always more busy and have always less time and so I'll posticipate what I want to learn forever. What can you advice-me? P.S.: I hope this question won't be taken as spam, kiddie or such.

Im a 31-year old with a felony record from when I was a teenager.  Ive already done everything I can to reduce the charges [originating from a single event], so unfortunately, it is as resolved as it probably ever will be.  Neither of my parents went to college, so they suggested I pursue English when I got my BA back in '08, since we all knew Id complete it.  My graduating GPA was a 3.27 from a state school, although I admittedly didnt put forth very much effort and couldve done a lot better. 

My record and lack of practical skills has severely hampered my career prospects.  Earlier this week, my fiancs father said I needed to have an executable life plan, or he would be forced to stand in the way of his daughters and my 8-year relationship now that she is completing her own education and about to start her career.  

I always wanted to do computer science, and was considering it prior to the ultimatum.  However, my math skills are notoriously bad, and it scared me away.  Before going to college, I dropped out of high school, but once I got my act together, I finished about two years worth in six months at a continuation school and graduated on time.  When Im bored, I learn, and usually I gravitate to technically-oriented areas.  In other words: dedication, interest, and working hard don't scare me; but being able to do the work in the first place does.

After speaking with a friend who works as an Assistant Professor in computer science at a well-known university, he said a lot of my assumptions about the field were wrongnamely, the math part (""There's math, but it's about as math-heavy as you want it to be depending on the program"") and my assumption I couldnt do CS because of my Bachelors in a humanities field.  I started taking the edX CS50 class from Harvard on his suggestion, and I think Im getting much of the material.  At a little less than halfway through, Im not confident at all, but I feel like I can learn the material with enough time.  I watched some videos on SQL, and that seems to make a lot more sense conceptually, so that was reassuring.  However, time is not on my side, and neither are my finances.  

I told my fiancs father of my interest in computer science, and he thought it was a great idea.  His concern was that my record would get in the way of my job prospects, but both he (a laser systems designer for various purposes he cant discuss) and my friend said they felt I was mentally capable of pursuing it (a serious concern for me, especially given my academic background).  My family, however, severely doubts me, and Id certainly have to take out substantial loans to pay for school and living expenses until graduating.

**So my questions to you wonderful folks who made it this far along:**

* How impaired will I be finding a job because of my criminal record, my lack of applicable work history, and/or my less than optimal education thus fareither in pursuing further education or finding subsequent employment?

* Given all the above circumstances, should I risk pursuing a Masters in CS?  If not, should I try to learn these skills on my own, and somehow try to find a job that way, or am I entirely barking up the wrong tree?

* Is there anything else Im missing or not considering?

Im very sorry for the length of this, but I really didnt know where else to turn for some experienced, unbiased answers.

I am also currently enrolled in an Object Oriented Java Programming class through my local community college. I'm totally excited to get more involved in Computer Science in college. 

Problem is, I don't have a laptop. (Not one that could get me through college, anyway) I've been using my family's laptop to get me through high school thus far, but the time has come to find one for myself. 

I'm looking for something that will get me through at least my 4 years in college. I'll be attending a university which requires lots of walking, so I'll need something that is manageable and can easily be carried around. Currently, I'm looking at either the MacBook Pro with Retina 13-inch base model (~$1400 w/ education discount and AppleCare) or the MacBook Air 13-inch maxed out (~$1400 w/ education discount and AppleCare). Storage isn't such a big issue for me, as I don't download lots of movies or big files. I think 128 GB should be plenty, and if I need more I can just use the SDXC slot or an external drive. Both models would come with 8 GB RAM, but the Pro would include a higher wattage processor that would be much better to use. I've never really gamed on a laptop, so graphics performance isn't a huge issue. Mostly, I browse YouTube, social networking, research, word processing, and coding. I always have tons of tabs and windows open at once. Both of these machines have pretty comparable battery lives, and either would likely get me through the day no problem. OS X is great for managing workspaces, which is why I'm going with either the Pro or Air (Unless there are any strong objections with incompatibilities).

I don't know where to put this, but I figured that this thread was full of people with similar experiences.

I've wanted to get a degree in computer science for a long time now. I started at my local community college under general engineering, and transferred into computer science when I realized how much I enjoyed coding.

I'm currently in my Sophomore year of a CS degree, after being set back by some bad grades, and transferring from engineering. I've always had some bad habits, that have given me some trouble in my early college years, but I have worked to fix those.

Getting to the point I am now has been really tough for me. I've always loved math and science before college, but now it feels like an absolute slog. I feel myself going through the motions, telling myself that I have to get through it.

I've been doing mainly math and science for around 4 years now (because of the bad grades, and transferring programs). I've only gotten a few actual computer science courses, and they weren't really challenging or satisfactory, yet I still craved them, because the curriculum is not built around computer science courses the first 2 years.

It seems as though the degree is set up to front load all the hard classes, and weed out people during freshman and sophomore years. I'm dying to get to the more (what I would consider fun) stuff, but I have almost no interest in the mathematics anymore. It feels like all of the enjoyment I had for math in high school has been stripped away.

I still have an extreme love of reading and learning about scientific discoveries and breakthroughs. I devour technology shows, and I listen to podcasts about all kinds of interesting scientific facts. I still love science and math from an outside prospective, but when I get into the classroom, it seems so tedious and boring. Mathematics, half of the time I can relate to absolutely nothing. It seems like numbers and complexity for the sake of numbers and complexity. I know that the things being taught have applications, but they are so convoluted and difficult that it seems like no person could be expected to be able to just do this on a daily basis (no calculator, and have it all memorized).

My course load is really heavy this semester, University Physics II, Vector Calculus, Differential Equations, and College Chemistry I. It feels like I have a test every week, and I always get extreme anxiety leading up to and during each and every single test. Following the tests, I usually feel an extreme low, knowing I could have done better.

I have a lot of pressure on me to get high grades in order to transfer to the school I want (and be able to stay close to home), but all it has done is give me panic and anxiety, and lead to terrible grades.

Now I'm left wondering if I really should be doing this degree. Is it really going to be any more fun if I'm already struggling? Will I end up hating my job because the math that I despise so much will come back to bite me? Should I go back and start over with another degree? I don't think I could handle starting over at this point. It would feel like the biggest failure of my lifetime.

I'm just really unsure of how to motivate myself to finish this semester, and now I'm also unsure of if continuing this path would be best for my health. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel, or am I doing more harm than good by continuing.

I'm sorry if this was long. I'm just very lost right now and need some guidance.",4,6,False,self,,,,,

Here is my story: I am playing with computers since elementary school. Building websites, trying to program, setting up servers and different kinds of hardware/software. When I went to High School I choose it specially to have a signature program with computers. 9-10 grade I did web design/development and loved it! 12 grade I was full time web intern at my HS.  I also did computer science 1 and AP Computer Science 11 &amp; 12 grade. I liked the CS but in the AP class my scores were low. Still I didn't give up went to community college and eventually transfered to CS major in my university, University of Maryland. Then something horrible happend. I attempted to take the exemption exam for intro to CS since I took it at HS, and I read a intro to Java book over the summer, I did poorly and didn't get the exemption. I also struggled a lot in my Calculus 2 class. I eventually got scared that maybe I am not smart enough to finish the CS program so after 2/3 weeks doing CS at UMD I switched my major to econ. I choose econ because I like it. Its easy &amp; fun for me so it seemed like the correct choice. 1 year I did econ not really thinking about CS, but then a friend from my home country told me that his university is uploading all of its CS lectures in youtube. I started watching and got hooked up to CS again. I did their intro to Javascript intro to php and intro to Java clases. I also started going to hackatons with people from my university, they said that they don't care about my major and I can join them so I decided to do it. Now I feel like I made a big mistake switching majors. I like econ, but my passion for computers and programming is bigger. The questions that I have are: If I stick to doing the university lectures online and build several projects do I have chances at securing a CS job with my econ degree? Also if I do well with econ, will schools consider me for masters programs in computer science. If you also have any other advice regarding what should I do, I would appreciate it. Thank you in advance!",1,3,False,self,,,,,

SMU gives me the ability to do a security track, which is my main interest. However, their degree requirements seem kind of silly to me compared to the average requirement of other colleges. SMU requires quite a bit of physics and other science to graduate with a BS, and I don't get why they require so much of science instead of math. I have heard so little about Fordham's CS program though. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",0,0,False,default,,,,,

By the way, he gave us the slides for the course, but they suck ass. There's tons of errors and mistypes and it's just not thorough and completely out of context.",2,1,False,self,,,,,
