So far we have only learned programming in C.  I feel like I have such a limited ability to program anything right now, because we never did anything outside of the command prompt.

The most advanced thing we did in the class is accessing a file, putting contents of the file into an array, and prompting a menu to choose what you want to do with the values in the array (like finding the mean, median, and mode), all occurring in the command prompt.  

Is this a decent place to be after learning C for a semester? (I had no prior programming knowledge)

Also, is C still a major language used today?  I wouldn't mind using it every once in a while, but I'd rather use a different language than C so I can program more interesting things.

* What are some other essential books for someone interested in computer science? 
* How might I be able to highlight what I already know to make me more marketable for a job that utilizes computer science skills?
* Are there part-time courses/certifications out there that I can take on-line (I have been taking Coursera and EdX courses but on-top of my other duties it has been hard)?
* What should be my main focus, i.e., programming, if so what language?

I am currently in post-secondary for my degree in Mechanical Engineering, but loved my intro course to computer science and have wanted to pursue it further without switching right into the subject (I like mech eng as well). The problem I have been facing for a long time is trying to figure out what to learn when without a formal education. For example, I learned python in my programming 101 class, but a lot of sites will assume Java knowledge. 

I was wondering if any of you know of any type of site where you can go to it and there is a complete pathway of a computer science degree with resources for each topic from beginning upwards, so that you know you will have the right prerequisites for the courses following? It doesn't need to be formal education, but I don't mind if it is either. I would ultimately like to gain enough programming skills to be adequate enough to be a programmer for a start-up. 

I hope its clear what I am trying to look for, thanks in advance :)",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm currently transferring to University from community college, and I need to make a decision in the next few months that could cost me a lot of money and time. I have the options of 

1. BS in CS, finish school in two years, have a little free time to sleep and do research. 
2.  BS in CS and BA in Computational Mathematics. This would take 3 years of my time and would be much, much tougher to accomplish.

I am taking out some loans for college, getting some grant money, and have some parental help. To go to school for 2 years would cost me roughly 35k in loans. To go to school for 3 years would probably cost me about 55k in loans, maybe more. 

I like the idea of doing just the CS degree and getting out in two years because it'll allow me to enter the job market quickly and begin paying down my loans to rid myself of the debt burden, but I truly love mathematics and I love combining mathematics and computer science. I feel like I only live once and not pursuing the second degree in Comp. Math would be something I dearly regret down the line. 

Anyways, what I'm really consulting you fellas for is advice on whether or not having a Computation Mathematics degree in addition to a CS degree is beneficial, and if it is beneficial, does it outweigh the cost of 20k more in loans and a full year of opportunity cost in terms of building a career.

How do I get to be one of those engineers that Silicon Valley fights over?

What is a good path to take since I already have an undergrad degree?

How hard is it to find a job if you have a good GPA? My undergrad GPA was 3.78.

What schools should i look at? What degree programs? What languages?

Is it worth it to re-roll as a programmer (I'm 27) financially? What could I expect to make my first year out of college as one?

I've looked at Rust and their macro system seems interesting, but I'm looking for a breadth of systems. Ideally, it would be something similar to PHP/ASP/JSP where you can have code interleved with other code and the intent is clear.

            &lt;% } %&gt;
