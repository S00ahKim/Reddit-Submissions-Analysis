2.  How often do you get to work from home?  Is it based on your position or the company?

3.  How hard was the schooling? I'm average at math and below average at science and I'm worried that the university program will be too much for me.  Also, are there any alternatives to the university route?

4.  Is it a good field to get into right now? Are demands high?

5.  I've heard that computer science is a very broad degree that can get you many different jobs. Is this true?

I am a final year Computer Science student who is just about to finish the first semester of the fourth year.

However, I have theoretical, some practical knowledge and I am good at Databases. I am aware of all, therefore I would like make a big change and do well this time. Throughout my studies, I have touched various programming languages in which I mostly have a starting level. 

Now, I have a final year project to complete which is to be an Android project and also second semester subjects will keep me busy enough. When I look at the job descriptions, they mostly require background in different areas which really scares me. In short, I need advice from experienced people/ users here. I feel my background is weak so it needs to be improved. On the other hand, it's a huge area so I am not sure on what to concentrate. Another option is to find a part time job. The thing is I have a couple of months before I graduate and I want to improve myself. I would really appreciate any advice and direction regarding with my situation. I live in Dublin, Ireland.

I ended up having to use a constant array for the first time today and had trouble understanding what the problem was. Turned out there wasn't enough 'space' in my array where I thought there would have been.

Original code: int const r[1]={random[0],random[1]};
Amended code: int const r[2]={random[0],random[1]};

So the original code came up with an error (I assume it's to do with not having enough array memory locations) and I fixed by adding another location to the array. Why is it that I need this when with normal arrays (non-constant) I could have used 'r[1]'?... is it a bit like strings where it just needs an extra memory location to hold the constant?",8,2,False,self,,,,,

I've been asked to prove the correctness of this recursive division algorithm:

    function divide(x,y) 

      if x = 0 then
        return (q,r) = (0,0);

      (q',r') = divide( floor(x/2), y );

      if x is even then
        if 2r'   &gt;= y then
          return (q,r) = ( 2q' + 1 , 2r' - y )        // Case 1
        else
          return (q,r) = ( 2q' , 2r' )                // Case 2
      else
        if 2r'+1 &gt;= y then
          return (q,r) = ( 2q' + 1 , 2r' + 1 - y )    // Case 3
        else
          return (q,r) = ( 2q' , 2r' + 1)             // Case 4

For the inductive hypothesis I assume that the result of divide(floor(x/2), y) is correct, or specifically:

    q' y + r' = floor(x/2)
    q' &gt;= 0
    0 &lt;= r' &lt; y

Then the following must be proven for each case:

    q y + r = x
    r &gt;= 0
    r &lt; y

I've proven cases 1 and 2 completely, and proved qy+r=x and r&gt;=0 for 3 and 4, but cannot figure out how to prove r &lt; y for those two cases. The closest I can get is r &lt; y+1 for case 3 and r &lt; 2y+1 for case 4. My work is as follows:

Case 3:

    r'      &lt; y      (by the inductive hypothesis)
    2r'+1-y &lt; 2y+1-y
    2r'+1-y &lt; y+1
    r       &lt; y+1    (by 2r'+1-y = r)

Case 4: *(edit: ignore this part I'm an idiot... still trying to figure out case 3 though)*

    r'      &lt; y      (by the inductive hypothesis)
    2r'+1   &lt; 2y+1
    r       &lt; 2y+1   (by 2r'+1 = r)

Can anyone point me in the right direction and help me finish this proof? I've been trying to figure it out for hours. This is not actually for a homework assignment, but rather a study question for an upcoming exam. Today was the first day of my graduate-level algorithms analysis course and the professor really wants to make sure we know this material from the undergrad curriculum...


**edit 1:** I figured out case 4... It was actually really easy.

    2r' + 1 &lt; y  (by the conditions of that code branch)
    r       &lt; y  (by 2r'+1 = r)

Still working on case 3, though...

**edit 2:** Nevermind... I'm so braindead from working on this that I didn't realize I had already proven this part of case 4. The part of that case I hadn't proven is r &gt;= 0. And it actually turns out that this is extremely easy... Since r'&gt;=0 by the inductive hypothesis, it must be the case that 2r'+1&gt;=0 therefore r&gt;=0.",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Currently, I'm a second-year comp sci major with a working knowledge of SQL/PHP/HTML/C++. I recently started a  Game Dev course this semester with Programming I being its only prerequisite. I assumed it would be fairly well-explained and walk me through the intricacies of game development.

Instead, our professor is apparently notoriously fond of assigning overly-challenging projects. Right now, our class of 26 students is tasked with developing an Android game that utilizes geolocation and proximity for turn-based battle with nearby opponents. These mobile clients are to be macromanaged in an RTS style with a desktop client. I managed to slap together an app that uses the android location manager to simply grab and display GPS coordinates, so that's not too bad. However, I'm having issues finding out how to post these coordinates to a database.

The professor also wants us to utilize Amazon EC2, which doesn't seem too difficult. I don't know if it would be better to install mySQL on the EC2 instance, or use Amazon's RDS so if any of you know which would prove easier in the end, I'd much appreciate some advice.

I'd like to ask you two questions.

First of all, he mentioned Anchor points. So, how do you choose anchor point? Is it just ""ONE"" anchor point or will there be a couples of random anchor points? If it was just one point, I do not think it would be able to identify a sample clip out of its range.

Secondly, he mentioned that the hash from database and sample clip are going to match if it seems to be the same track. But how would they be the same unless they can use the same anchor point for sample clip? Or do they just store all the X points as anchor points?

So I want to write one that's a bit more serious for a language whose design I've been slowly accumulating for a long time. I'm wondering how I should start out for this one. I'd like to start writing it in Haskell before the inevitable (and temporally distant) switch to self-compiling. But the question is if I should use a parser generator / library or if I should write my own parser from scratch. My options appear to be:

* Parsec: A Haskell parser library.
* Alex / Happy: A haskell lexer / parser generator.
* FLex / Yacc: A C lexer / parser generator.
* Write from scratch.

The more I look into Happy, the less enticing it is. While it looks great for the actual parsing job, it's error recovery is atrocious. Parsec's error recovery is much better but the library itself is a little ugly and verbose compared to just having a grammar file. Yacc seems to have really complex, but powerful error recovery, and it uses the handy grammar file idea, but it seems difficult to use effectively and I don't get to write in Haskell like I wanted. Writing it from scratch means I have to do *a lot* on my own, but is in the end the most capable.

I have a question for you all.,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/2u9oa4/scared_i_may_have_made_a_mistake_i_have_a/,PuffPipe,1422672926,"I am currently a senior in high school. I have been considering computer science as a major for a while, but haven't taken it seriously until now. Because of this, I've already applied to a community college to study something unrelated. I have decided now that I want to pursue a degree in Computer Science. The university that I want to go to has a scholarship deadline that has already passed, which pretty much rules out the possibility of me going there as a freshman now.

This is where I'm stuck. Would doing my generals at this community college have any negative affect on my future? Such as different job opportunities and whatnot?

I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but as you all know, college can be very stressful. Especially to someone about to graduate highschool. Also, if you guys want to share any tips you wish you knew before you started CS, feel free. Thanks!",9,0,False,self,,,,,

Another thing is that we are learning Pascal in computing and I know that this is an old language so is it worth learning a new language to increase my chances of getting on the course that I want and if so what language should I learn?",19,7,False,self,,,,,
