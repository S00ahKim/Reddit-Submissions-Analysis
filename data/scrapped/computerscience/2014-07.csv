I have a 3.5 GPA and I'm planning on going into school for Computer Science. 

Obviously, I have done my research and found some of the best schools for CS, even looking at ROI, but they all happen to be either A) Expensive B) Selective (too selective for my so-so 3.5 :/ ) or C) huge. While there are some attainable public schools in the top 20 like Purdue (in-state for me), UIUC, UT Austin, and University of Michigan, they all fall under that C point, they're huge. Does anyone know of a smaller school (that isn't impossibly selective) that has a fairly good CS department? Or does it look like I should get over the size and go to my in-state gem, Purdue?

Are there any good resources where we can get some sort of spec as a prompt and we work through the spec to decide what data structures we should use and what the flow of the app should be?

For some background, my friend has completed some of the CodeAcademy courses and complained that they didn't really learn anything.  I was kind of surprised since I've only heard good things about CodeAcademy, I gave it a shot, and I had to agree that it doesn't really teach you anything useful other than syntax.

I've been teaching my friend some CS concepts, such as basic data structures, search and sort algorithms, etc, but some sort of prompt that I can guide her through and have her discover the answers herself would be nice.

Ideally I could find an affordable master's degree program, but so far all the ones I have found require applicants to have an undergrad degree in CS or something similar. 

I would be ok going back and getting a bachelor's degree in CS, but if I'm doing that I really need to find an affordable program that will accept the credits from my degree in philosophy so I wont have to do gen ed courses and so it wont take me 4 years again.

The problem is to calculate the smallest set of elements Sp such that every set *S1*, *S2*, ..., *Sn* contains at least one element from Sp. In other words, you need to pick the smallest bunch of elements which are sufficient to cover all the sets - where element *e* covers set *S* if *S* contains *e*.

The problem on the face of it appears to be NP hard. 

My questions are: 

1. Can this problem with modeled somehow in graph theory? Is there a common name for such a problem?

2. Are there any effective algorithms to solve particular cases of this problem? 

For the record, in the instance of the problem I faced, *n* was about 2200 and each *S* contained 22 elements. The number of sets an element was present in varies a lot, but I would say that the average is about 10-15.

How much they pay will depend on how well I present this information to them.

I'm in Ohio and I've heard mixed reviews on IT Tech so I'm iffy on going there.

So far I understand the Noam Chomsky is an excellent author to look into if I wish to explore the subject. For related material I find regular languages and automata theory to be fascinating, so these are excellent side subjects to reccomend reading material for as well.

I am going to a large trade show in which there will be about 500k people. I will have a booth with computers set up. I am considering using my iPhone 5's hotspot feature from Verizon to provide a wireless internet network to these computers for the show.

However, I have a serious concern about the potential security threats because I will be showcasing a website that is still in development and is not inherently secure itself. We have proprietary information on this site that, if it were stolen, could be very detrimental to us.

I have two options: spend a lot of time to make this website work locally (currently on Amazon), or just access it from the hotspot connection.

With this said, how secure is this connection? Is it more secure to use the WiFi than Bluetooth? If I use the WiFi I plan to use a very long custom passcode with a combination of capital letters, lower case, and numbers. I say very long because I think this comic convinced me that length is more important than complexity:

http://xkcd.com/936/

Also, my concern is not just with the WiFi network, it's with the phone talking to Verizon via LTE.  Is that encrypted?

Thanks!

Got me a good job and everything. But this is really elementary stuff! I want to do data mining and analysis and do something with all that data. Find meaning. 

How do I start out? 

For the record I am behind in math (think precal). I'm attending a community college as a sophomore and working full-time as a web developer. I am looking for something to get me started in data mining and analysis while I can study calculus and stats and linear algebra alongside and, later on, get into the more complex things like machine learning and AI.

I just graduated college with a computer science degree and I feel like I wasted 3 years. I was the typical student that sat in the back of the class listening to lectures and went home and do the assignments and did not have time to ""experiment"" with code and do all the crazy stuff that over achievers did.

So now I am job hunting and trying to find a list of books that are recommended for industry programmers. 

What would a Google Software Developer have in his/her library for programming reference and overall become a better programmer?

Books that I just bought because stack over flow people said its really good to have are Code Complete 2  and Pragmatic Programmer.

Any more suggestions for someone that would like to work at a software company?

And I do have have Corman Intro to algorithms book that I am working myself through at the moment.

Did you take classes online or did you have to commute to the campus?

what was your admissions process like? Do you go through the normal admissions application and let them know you're going to be a part time student?

I have a hard time finding the information on school's websites, is there a different name for graduate students who work full time?

is the application process the same? (gre, letters of rec, ect?)
