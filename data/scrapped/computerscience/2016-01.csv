Kind of lost tbh...,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/3yzydd/trying_to_keep_up_to_date_with_technologies_and/,cloudawaythrowaway,1451632868,"I'm really not sure whether I'm posting to the right subreddit, but here goes.  
I am a (fresh) college grad with a CS and math double major. I have a full time job, and it involves working on a (mid-size) cloud service backend. Been at this job for a few months now.  
While I feel that my general foundations for CS are strong enough, I'm really lost as to how people discover the technologies that we decide to use (such as open source reverse proxy, service discovery etc.). At this point, I kind of accept these techs and start using them as other teammates decide on what tech we should be using. However, I really want to be in a position where I can start suggesting the third party technologies that we should start using, and be able to weight the pros/cons of each one.  
Are there any news sites or magazines that I can start reading up on in my off time for these techs (better if cloud focused) so that I don't feel that I'm always kind of behind?  
Really asking this because while I'm in an okay position right now since I'm young, I fear that in the future I will not have kept up to date with the times, and therefore will be just ""that expendable coder #4"" in the future.  
Additionally, I'm familiar with the MS-DOS setting, and pretty good with scripting in powershell. However, my unix system and bash scripting experience is pretty weak... What are some good ways to fix this? ",3,7

First off, apologies if this isn't the right place to ask this... I've looked at cscareerquestions and askcomputerscience and it doesn't really seem like either subreddits will be too helpful and a quick google search didn't really turn up much information.

Can anyone comment on how good/bad of an idea it would be to do a Masters in Mathematics to apply for a PhD in Computer Science. I'm an undergraduate Math major, with a CS minor. I enjoy Math however, after taking upper-year pure math classes this semester, I'm not sure I can really ever do good work in Math at a ""high level"" however, I would like to study more of it. At the same time, I am taking a few CS courses and find that it comes more a little more easily.

My plan at the moment would be to apply for Masters programs in Math after graduating, and then hopefully enter a PhD program for Computer Science. I'll be taking CS courses along the way and by the time I'm nearing my the end of my Masters degree, I should have all the coursework of a typical undergrad and maybe one or two grad courses.

Will having this extra mathematical background be particularly helpful a CS PhD? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!",2,1

The professor for the latter has said my background would be fine, and I think it could be a good opportunity to see if I want to go further with computational social science and big data approaches.

However, would it be best to take the intro course first? I've heard that it's sometimes good to learn things as you need them, but it also seems like a foundation would be helpful. For what it's worth, I didn't find the Python Codecademy course (which I'm aware is incredibly basic) to be difficult.",2,2

We have a final project due the end of spring, to design and implement a software project of our choosing.

My idea is to build a client/server application, specifically a server app that runs a chess program, allows players to log in and matches them together for chess games, and the client the players will use to log into the system and play the game. 

I chose this because I think it will teach me a lot about software development, and network functionality. 

I'm not sure yet where to begin, so I thought I would ask for advice. I'm inclined to do this on Linux, but it would be cool if other people actually used this when I'm done, not just other CS people who use Linux, but regular Windows users. So maybe I could develop the server application for Linux, and the client to run on Windows.

So I'm not sure yet what language(s) or compiler(s) to use for a project like this. Anyone with any experience who could show me a potential lead would be appreciated, or an advice at all really. Thanks!",2,0

I am currently job hunting for my first job in software development. I am fortunate to have gotten a decent amount of interviews but I honestly hate the standard 9 to 5 gig. I wanted to ask for input on a couple things. I don't want to just accept a job offer without really thinking it through... or should I just for experience? Anyways, questions below..


*Starting Salary*

I am getting ridiculously low and high offers. Some around 40k and others near 70k. Why is there such a gap? If you don't mind sharing, what was your starting salary entering the career? What would you say a good starting salary is. 


*Commuting*

Most of these jobs are 30+ minutes away. How painful is a commute over time?


*Independent Software Developer*

As said previously, I really do not enjoy 9 to 5 hours. How viable is it to become an Independent Software Developer right out of school? Has anyone done this, if so tell me what it was like.

I've been having some trouble looking for my first ever job during my time studying CS at school. I've had a few interviews with various companies, but they somehow have all ended terribly  with them not responding after the interview. 

Since I'm in school, I've asked for help from my co-op office for advice on how to prepare my self better for success in a interview but they really haven't been much help at all. 

I've also read parts of Cracking the Coding Interview and various websites to prepare my self for these interviews. But when it comes to the actual interview where I'm asked to answer the CS related question such as using/creating an algorithm for a word problem, I get frustrated/stumped by the question and am unable to give the right answer.

At this point of time I'm not quite sure what I should do and was thinking of going strait into 4th year. 

Is there anything I could do to prepare myself better for a CS interview. I really don't feel confident in what I'm doing right now will lead me to an internship.

Any help would be great.

I've recently been hired as a researcher level 1 for an energy research center and, one thing is certain, I'll be using computers all the time. We develop software from scratch. We design the code, we test it, and we develop the user's interface (I think I should say 

I'm not part of all these processes. We break it down into teams so the job gets done more quickly).

Beyond that, it's been some time by now when I first thought of furthering my knowledge in CompSci. No matter what path I follow, 
I'm certain I'll benefit greatly from it.

So I took it to the interwebs to see where to start. Up to now I have found these options:

1. MIT - Intro CompSci and Programming - syllabus: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/Syllabus/

2.MIT - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - syllabus: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/syllabus/

3.MIT - Intro to Elect. Eng and CompSci I - http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/Syllabus/

4.Harvard - CS50 - CompSci - https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

I'd like to stress I have no prior knowledge of computer science. I have taken only two courses thru my original bachelor's, which was in Environmental Eng, and both classes were sadly weak.

For my job I code in Fortran77. I am part of the Water Resources - Energy nexus group and Fortran77 still has a niche within Earth Sciences. Obviously, I want to go beyond the Fortran and seek for ways to understand programs from the inside out.

I know this is not a sprint, but rather a marathon; hence, my search for help.

Option #4 (CS50x) is an internet sensation, an all-time fave for many; but the other courses also seem extremely well structured and thru MIT OpenCourseware I can get access to the class videos.

As to build a strong basis in CompSci - I have no rush, but I do want to do it thoroughly - which option would be the best?

I've been looking around and I've thinking of taking Math for CompSci and Intro to Algorithms, both from MIT as well, once I finish my intro to Comp Sci itself.

If you can give me any input, I'll be truly grateful! Thanks a lot =D",4,5

I am kalyan.
I am a 12th standard student from india.
I have applied for computer science in waterloo and im very inrested to go to waterloo after knowing about it but im not sure if i could get into or not...i have lot lot questions to get clarified ill mention as many as possible ...please spare some time to answer whatever you guys know which could help my future to get brighter...

1.Do i have a chance to get into waterloo CS(co-op) with my grades?

My grades:
10th standard:9 grade points out of 10 (subj individuals:1st language-9 points,english-9points,maths-9 points,science-9 points,social sciences-9 points) which in percentage goes between87-90(let it be 87%).

11th standard:424 out of 470 marks(french-97/100,english-91/100,maths-130/150,physics-54/60,chemistry-52/60) with a 90%

my 12th mid term(predicted)-448/470(french-99/10,english-95/100,maths142/150,physics-57/60,chemistry-55/60)

i have gave an average AIF with lot of extra curriculars but none of them were not even state level...all of them are from school level and district level...so i dont think my ecs will be valuabel(however i have touch in all types of ecs like singing,skating,swimming,cricket,soccer,tennis,running races)
and i have also mentioned about the c++ and java courses i have learnt in my holidays time..

2.here in india we dont have a special mathematics paper for calclus as it is a part of the paper with all the others like geometry,trignometry etc..so what do i have to do now?should i explain them regarding it?

3.it is mentioned in the website that students should apply and send transcripts by feb 4th to be considered under earl admission...so will i be given admission under early acceptance,if yes do they consider m 12th marks after they are released(later in may)..i mean will there be any target for me to get more than 90% or mid marks?

4.is it really difficult for an average student like me to pass the waterloo standards after getting admitted?do we really have to be a book worm?(i have seen many reviews saying many fail out and take the courses again and again)

5.i dont undersand what is co-op in real?what i know is we get a work in some company on apid basis after 1st year,what soes it mean?should we go for work everyday after college hours?how many hours can we do co op work per week?if we are in co-op work wont we be permitted to do normal part time jobs in resturants or on campus part time?

6.do waterloo have good scholarships?will i be able to get scholarships?ive heard that schulich leader scholarship given by uni calgary is the best one...am i elegible for it?

7.what is meant by electives?

8.i want to do bussiness degree with my cs degree but i have applied for just cs degree in ouac application ...can i still do bussiness degree with cs degree after getting admitted?

9.apart from cs i have also applied for aviation and sciences in the waterloo...is it a good choice?does it have good jobs?


if someone can take a special care on me explaining all these personally can just msg me at ""https://www.facebook.com/kalyan151098""

I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm tired of people coming in here asking how they can ""become a software engineer"" or ""get a computer science job"" or a ""programming job"" without the degree. I think it is safe to say that most of us that subscribe to this subreddit are here because we are Computer Science majors. 

The degree we have, or are seeking, is not to be belittled. You can't just go out there and learn tons of coding and get the $100k/year job that you keep seeing on the news. You need the degree (in most cases). Our degree isn't just coding, we learn algorithms and a plethora of other knowledge, including great fundamentals.

Post the links to their departments and I'll check it out. Want advice on how to grow yourself so you are more marketable? I'm here for you. Want to know what you can do in as little time and effort as possible to get a high paying job like Computer Science majors? Get a Computer Science degree, plain and simple. There are no shortcuts.

I am 23 years old and finished my Bachelor of Commerce 2 years ago at the University of Guelph in Ontario.  After getting into the working world, I have decided that I want to change my career direction while I am still young.

I have decided that I want to pursue a CS degree.  The creative aspect of some CS jobs is a real draw to me, as is the ability to get a sense of accomplishment from a completed job that I can't seem to find in my current job.

I am considering 3 different programs in Canada and would like some input.  I am ideally trying to complete my degree in under 4 years as a second or sequential degree program, however if it makes more sense to stay an extra year for a co-op option, I would consider that.

The three programs are:

* **Brock University B.Sc** - 3 years, no co-op because of shortened program

* **Wilfred Laurier B.Sc** - 3-4 years (depending on transfer credits), not likely to have co-op with the shortened program.

* **UBC BCS program** - Great because it is 2.5 years and has the option for co-op, however BC is farther from home than I would like.
(https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/programs/second-degree/index.html)

I was wondering how these programs compare in the eyes of an employer and if anyone has experiences that they can share.  I have narrowed my selection down to these three because of their admission requirements.  Unfortunately I can not get into Waterloo or McMaster.  I have looked at college programs, but I don't think they would be as advantageous.

Furthermore, how necessary is the co-op aspect?  I would definitely like to get some work experience in school if I can.  Is a summer placement difficult to get without co-op?  I realize it may be with the necessary training.

Participation in this research is open to any persons between the ages of 18 and 60 years, that are not incarcerated (i.e., prisoners) or a member of another legally protected population (i.e., intellectually handicapped, children, etc.), with the exception of pregnant women (the procedures and materials used in this study do not limit the participation of pregnant women). You may be excluded from participation if you do not have sufficient formal training or experience in interpretation of data, hypothesis testing, or construction of reasoned argument to effectively answer questions about analytic process or participate in laboratory tasks. Ideally, potential participants have at least 3 years applied or working experience within an analytic vocation (e.g., intelligence, military, legal, business, marketing, credit, banking, finance, and capital markets, etc.), OR post-graduate training within a relevant area of study and associated analytic skills (e.g., economics, behavioral sciences, statistics, political science, etc.), OR have had relevant internships, post-doctoral, or research experience. However, should you feel that you meet the requirements given your applied experience, we will consider eligibility on a case-by-case basis. 
 
**Additional Study Details**

Study Duration:  Your participation in this study can involve up to 3 hours of your time: approximately 30-60 minutes to fill out online questionnaires, and 90-120 minutes as you engage in online analytic tasks. Additional follow-up tasks with similar content may be solicited, with your permission. Each of these are estimated to take between 90-120 minutes.

*Participant Involvement*:  Participation involves both completion of the online questionnaires and online tasks, which involve using next generation analytic tools to solve difficult analytic problems using complex data sources. However, participation in the online questionnaires neither obligates you to participate in online analytic tasks nor guarantees that you will be invited for follow up tasks.
 
*Compensation*:  Participation is strictly voluntarythere is no monetary compensation for participation in this study. However, participants being recruited from university research sites may be eligible for course/research credit commensurate with their participation as per their institutions guidelines.

I can guarantee that many other CS majors here will agree with what I have to say.

1. **Join CS or IT clubs**: This is very important if you're looking for a job or internship. Most campuses will have an ACM chapter or some other type of CS club. If your school doesn't have one, *start one*; not only will ""I started the ACM chapter at my school"" look really good on a resume, but CS clubs are great if you don't understand an assignment or you want to just collaborate on a project with other CS majors.

2. **Programming Competitions**: This is something I wish I had started doing earlier. Programming competitions look good on resumes (if you feel like adding them) but also if you win there's usually an awesome prize that you can receive (usually a scholarship). 

3. **Undergrad Research/Tech Jobs**: Most professors are going to be doing research on *something*. If you impress a professor by getting A's in their class they'll probably ask you if you want to research with them, or they'll probably say yes if you ask them. *Key Tip: don't just wait around for professors to ask you.*

4. **Ask Good Questions**: This is more or less for your studies, but make sure that if you don't know something that you ask. Also it's always better to know more than you need to know. 

5. **Ask Your Advisor or Fellow Students About Courses!**: This is fairly important if you actually want to graduate within 4 years. Some schools only offer certain courses during certain semesters, some teachers teach certain courses during certain semesters, so ask around about who to take and when to take certain classes. Most upperclassmen will be able to tell you what teacher for what class and which classes you should take at the same time. *Class pairings can be important*. For instance: If you take Data Structures and C++ at the same time, you'll cover recursion in-depth at the beginning of the semester in Data Structures, and then you'll be prepared to cover recursion not-so-in-depth at the end of the semester in C++. 

This is all I have at the moment, but I'm sure other CS majors have some useful tips as well.

The operating system has been built from the ground up using the Linux kernel to really take advantage of the Internet's abilities and work with the hardware. It's all designed to be self hosted.

I have recently taken this to a computer club and presented it and got mostly good feedback and how I could make it better. I'm making new discoveries all the time and I believe I'm only scratching the surface. It does take more people to really bring out the potential though. There's a lot of big ideas I could do with it. Home automation, make a dispatch service for businesses, create your own personal YouTube or media streaming server. The best part is you don't rely on any third party sites and you can build multiple folders people can connect to that do different things.

Here's a video that demonstrates how this works. It is an hour long but this project starts at 14:00.

There are times when you would like to either return or continue processing based upon a set of conditions

I sometimes find myself writing code like the following


    // do stuff
    somethingIsTrueOrThrow();
    // do more stuff

And it works great because it short circuits the rest of the function, as appropriate.  Suppose, however, you want return a value instead, but only under specific conditions.

    // do stuff
    if(somethingIsTrue()) {
      return someValue();
    }
    
    // do stuff

Are there any languages that allow the SomethingIsTrue() function call to indicate for a short circuit of the logic?

    // do stuff
    returnif checkThatSomethingIsTrueAndReturnOtherwise();
    
    // do stuff


There's a more generic pattern here wanting to get out, but I'm more interested in this particular usage.

It's not a big deal, but it's something I've run into over the years and often wondered if there were languages that allowed this sort of pattern.",16,2

[This guy here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/600963/1700223) says that asynchronicity can have two flavors: 

* simulated asynchronicity ( let me call it that way)- where a thread is spawn for the async execution of some operations. To me this is a fake-asynchronicity and it's similar to multi-threading. I don't see any real benefits over multi-threading. 
 
* hardware supported asynch - where the request is just forwarded to the Hardware Controller (like the IO Controller or the Network Controller) and the control of 
 execution is immediately returned to the CPU. When the IO operation is ready, the CPU is notified and a call back is executed.
This seems ok if you think about one single IO request, but if I try to extend the example for multiple IO requests then I still arrive at the same multi-threading idea only that 
the multi-threading has been forwarded to the Hardware Controller. 
Here's a diagram for help: 


    1. CPU    ----- io async req 1 -----&gt; Hardware controller
    2. CPU	&lt;------ return ------- HC
    3. CPU    ----- io async req 2 ------&gt; HC
    4. CPU	&lt;------ return ------- HC	
    5. CPU executes other operations while the HC executes two IO tasks
    6. CPU 	&lt;------- data for req 1 ------- HC
    7. CPU executes the callback 
    8 CPU executes other operations
    9. CPU &lt;-------- data for req 2 ------- HC 
    10. CPU executes the callback 


As you can see, at line 5, the hardware controller (HC) handles two tasks simultaneously. So, as I said, whichever way I think about asynchronicity I still come up with multi-threading, of course this time is not the CPU that handles the multi-threading but the Hardware Controller.

Am I wrong ?  
Does  the hardware controller accept some sort of multi-threading ?  
If yes, is the multi-threading offered by the hardware controller much better that the CPU multi-threading mechanism ? 
If not, then the hardware controller is executing synchronously multiple IO operations, in which case, I don't see the benefits of asynchronicity vs. multi-threading.
