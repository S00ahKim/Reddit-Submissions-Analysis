While I was nearing completion on my assignment I found someone online having trouble with the same thing I was doing. It's worth noting that this person's code did not work properly and I was curious to see what was going wrong. So I put it into a seperate file on my IDE and tested it. I didn't really have time to spend trying to figure out why it didn't work and eventually I gave up and finished my assignment and forgot about it. Fast forward a few months later I get an email saying that I cheated and they attached a MOSS file showing an 89% match between one of my files and the file of some other kid I didn't know. It turns out I forgot to remove that failed online solution from my IDE and they tagged that. I never claimed that work to be mine and I didn't show it to a TA for credit. Plus, just to double check I ran my own MOSS check on my original work and the one from the other guy and it only turned up a 25% match. I know MOSS isn't used as objective evidence but the only glaring similarities I can see are a similar flow of logic but they gave us specific steps on how to complete the assignment. Has anyone been in a similar situation or any advice how to convey this misunderstanding? Thanks.",2,2

I'm a Freshman CS major in the college of engineering at UIUC. It's about that time where I want to slightly narrow down my career paths (not too much, but a bit). Can any of the CS peeps be generous enough to give me some ideas about which career paths I might want to look into? I don't think I have an internship for the summer as of now, so I want to know what career paths are hot so that I can learn the relevant skills over Summer!

&amp;#x200B;

1. I like inventing stuff. I like being creative.
2. I'd like to manage large scale projects in the future and/or move up to an executive position at some point (although I don't think there is a single career path that better prepares you for this?)
3. I don't think I want to do something TOO math-y. Obviously, as a CS major I appreciate the power of math, but I don't think I'm just ready to do a lot of math for a career path.
4. I would like to do something that will still be ""hot"" in the future or will continue to be relevant.

I was bullied in college, particularly by the frat boys and sorority girls. And there were TAs who acted like jerks and made me feel like an idiot. Yet, they got away with it, since they were excellent students and the professors adored them.

And I hate ""you're a big boy, you're in college."" They don't know the struggles of those with autism, such as myself.

This is why I take online classes.

Whoever says college years are the best years of your life needs to be thrown in jail and executed, since it's not for me. Especially since I'm 28, which is considered elderly for campus and gets you mistreated by students and professors alike.",0,1

&amp;#x200B;

I am a freshman (international student) in the U.S majoring in computer science and I am currently taking Object Oriented Design. We do have 10 homework for that class including 5 with a partner. We only have one partner and unless you have a very good reason, you can not switch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I struggled a bit during the first part of the semester but I went to every office hours and still manage to get decent grades and understand the main concepts.  I do not have a lot of friends in my class and I actually asked someone to be my partner but that person is really low grades for most of the first five homework and I feel he has a lack of motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

To contrast with that situation, last semester I took a class in C and we had a new random partner each week. I often had to partner with people who already knew how to code and actually it did not help me at all since the gap was really important. So they basically did most of the homework and that is it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is the following, would you rather work with someone who is or someone? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe if you are asking what I want to do after college, I would like to work in the Edtech industry, probably start my own company. ",0,0

     Im not sure were any of you live but where I do my school takes security very seriously also students bring laptops to school for working on my school has recently started requiring students to download software on their personal laptops to be able to use them on school WiFi this immediately set off red flags for me (Im hoping to go into cyber security when Im older and I know a lot about computers) the software is called LANSCHOOL and it has to be installed on laptops in order for the school WiFi to work my bf and I were able to obtain the source code for the program and dissect it. What it does is it tracks what students are doing  online, which is fine and well AT SCHOOL however this continues to monitor students outside of school while connected to home networks (I would be fine with this if it was a school laptop but we have to put these on our personal laptops we take home, thats not even the scary part though it also allows school administrators to remotely access the webcam (we were able to obtain an admin login and confirm this dont ask me how Im not telling) I think this should scare parents because schools shouldnt have that kind of power only the police and law enforcement should, Im scared at what privacy violations schools get away with in the name of child safety.

**Current Study:**

We are now running a second study to understand the relationship between these attitudes and performance on analytical reasoning and divergent thinking tasks. Please see below for the invitation to the current study.

Study Recruitment:

You are invited to participate in a research study on attitudes about engineering and design, and the relationship between these attitudes and performance on analytical reasoning and divergent thinking tasks. In order to participate, you must be an engineer, designer, or other STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) professional/student at least 18 years of age.

If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete a survey and five short answer questions in Qualtrics, an online survey platform. You will also be asked to complete some demographic questions. The study will take 15-20 minutes total. The study has been approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board \[HUM00154807\].

Please review the informed consent document [linked here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/roqk7ckjy6jdo44/HUM00154807_Adult%20Consent.docx?dl=0). If you would like to participate, follow the link below:

I want to try and reiterate what I understand about RSA and hope that you can correct me if I am wrong, and answer questions that I have.

&amp;#x200B;

A would like to send a message (m) to B : ""Hi I am Acoloas.""

A encrypts the message with his private key (A\_Private), so that Encrypt(m, A\_Private) = c, where 'c' is the encrypted message, ""Axv21$@!32"".

B receives 'c', and deciphers the message with A's public key (A\_Public) , so that Decipher(c, A\_Public) = m, the original message.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the reason a message can be encrypted with one key and deciphered with another revolves around this equation: A\_PublicA\_Private = 1 mod Phi(n), where n is the product of two prime numbers that are not publicized.

Technical Questions:

1. Is there exactly one solution to the equation  \[A\_PublicA\_Private = 1 mod Phi(n)\] for any A\_Public or A\_Private? In other words, can an encrypted message be deciphered by more than one key?
2. How is A\_Public and A\_Private chosen? Is it a number that can be rerolled between/during messages? Or is it a static number that is unique to each party?
3. The encryption algorithm is (m\^e)mod(n)=c. Is the exponent an exponential or just a figure of speech? How is this operation carried out efficiently, since I imagine any number to the e power, if e is very large, would take a very long time and make the message very large.
4. Can the message be encrypted and deciphered with one key (i.e. is the encryption algorithm reversible, I know it is not, but how do I understand it)?
5. Does n necessarily have to be the product of two prime numbers? Does this algorithm still work even if it is not (disregarding the strength of the encryption)? 

General Questions:

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of RSA versus other encryption methods like the Diffie-Hellman key exchange?
2. What does RSA looks like in real implementations when two parties are exchanging messages?
3. Is there a very simple RSA implementation that I can look at so that I can try and understand it?

He has told me many times that he is not a graduate student seeking a degree but he is auditing the courses.  However, I was tutoring him the best I could because I did not have any other students to help, then out of nowhere he is telling me that he is a graduate student.  He does not know Java, which is the base language, and he took C++ courses 20 years ago and has been a tutor ever since or something of that nature.  He has a EE bachelor's and seems like he is intelligent but he keeps asking me to do the assignments for him and acting like I am a servant of his or something.  To be honest, I am still an undergraduate student in mathematics, and I am extremely interested in the course work but I either need to teach other students or get some of my own work done.  I just don't know how to procede, today he asked me how a web server works and the difference between client and server, which I was somewhat blunt with him and told him that I don't think he is going to make it through this program, especially since he was talking about a PhD program in the area.  He is old roughly 60, I like him as a person but his persistent questions drive me up the wall, but now my heart is breaking thinking about why he is even in the graduate program?  I have thought about setting aside time to help him for free but I don't know if this is wise.  I am not an elitist jerk that thinks everyone should know what a web server is, but it is hard for me to look a grad student in the eyes and explain how to serve web pages.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel bad because when he was in school, the internet was like top secret and barely used by anyone at that time.  TCP was forged in the 80's I believe, so I guess that is considered a learning curve in and of itself but the way I need to go about this is somewhat daunting.  I don't want to crush this guy but I also have to be straight-forward about how I tutor him.  Today we were going over how to compile a java program and he was forgetting the .java when firing javac.  I took C++ in school, so I only know Java decently well, so I just googled the error and fixed it in about a minute or two.  I am NOT a CS professional, it's just I know what [google.com](https://google.com) is and I type 60+ words per minute.  Where should the emphasis be?  I am tutoring an advanced programming course, so I am the only person tutoring a graduate student.  To be honest, I love it, it teaches me knew things like today we were going over the JIT and JVM in Java and it is truly fascinating, but other people take precedence during that time.  I gave him this as a plan:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Every question you have write it down so if I don't answer all of your questions I can read them over and create responses that we can over whenever I have time in the tutoring shop.
2. GOOGLE!!! I didn't say it like that but I don't know what else to say
3. Anytime a linux command does not work then do man ""blank"" to find out what it is and how to use it.
4. When I see him tomorrow, I will find a head first Java or tell him to buy it.

When he told me he didn't know Java, I thought like ""oh, I did C++ in school I just went through the oracle 8th edition book.""...No, he does not know Java at all and he asking me to implement Graduate level code.  Like I said, I love that stuff and hopefully I will be in the same program at the end of next year, but please help me with tips on setting boundaries, how not to be a jerk, recommendations for material...I told him that graduate school requires a skill in researching, so hopefully I can get that into his head.  I was thinking about offering him a tutoring service, like $30 an hour and maybe do like 4 hours for $100, and try to spread it out over the course of the week so I can set up checkpoints for him..

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr     He is a really sweet guy but he doesn't know Java or how to Google things, and the last thing I want to do is tell an old man to ""buzz off"" when there's a possibility that his wife has died or possibly something tragic happened to catalyze entry to a graduate program at 60.

Now, the thing is he won't exactly tell me what the title of my paper will be, I have to find something for that. I'm doing a paper about DoS/DDoS attacks (so, networking/security), but I've had trouble finding something specific to write about, because I'm concerned I won't find enough info to write those 30ish pages. Basically, I can't just write only generally about DoS attacks, it has to be something more specific (for example, I've found a paper called ""Detection and prevention of DoS attacks using machine learning""), but since I haven't yet had any subjects about ML, I can't really do that. Is there anyone who wrote/read papers similar to what I'm describing, or if there is a person who is a bit more expirienced than me who could help me out with a specific subject &amp; title for my paper?

The problem is how can I minimise the total cost in finding x? My intuitive approach is to do a binary search on the b\[i\]'s. This reduces the total number of operations (since I get that O(logn) comparisons) but I can't exactly see how this would minimise the total cost.

So I have an unrelated bachelors in biology (FML), and rather than getting a second bachelors in CS, etc. I would like to get a masters in software engineering or software development. I am hoping to eventually become a software developer.

I am looking for noob friendly online masters degrees that require no background in CS; I would like to be able to just start it without any prep work. I am looking for masters degrees designed for career changers that have all the necessary prereqs built into the program, so that I can start right away. Preferably they would be online so that I do not have to relocate.

Anyone have any suggestions for programs? 

Some programs Ive found that require only an unspecified bachelors degree with no CS background:

UPenn MCIT

BU MET software development

DePaul Software Engineering: Software Development

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

p.s. I am aware of Georgia Techs OMSCS and probably wouldnt get in due to lack of prereqs. 

p.p.s. I would like to get a masters, so that I may get federal loans to pay for it (unlimited amount of loans are available for graduate studies), finish it in less time, and have a masters rather than a bachelors degree (to somewhat console me for getting a bachelors in bio in the first place, so it won't be a complete waste).

I prefer getting a masters compared to being self taught mainly for the loans to cover living expenses and also to get a piece of paper to show that I am somewhat competent enough to get the job.",7,2

I've never really considered academia in CS and don't really know anything about the state of it, seeing as I'm not an actual CS student right now. So I'm trying to ask around to kind of gauge I guess what it's like, how easy it is to get into, how demanding it is, how fixated on paper publishing it is (physics certainly is) etc. I just always see CS students talk about getting jobs is all and never academia, but I'm unsure if that's because of money being a big motivator in why people go into CS in the first place (it's not too much of a concern for me) or because it's worth avoiding compared to private sector environments. 

I get it would help if I could be specific about \*what\* I'd want to research, but I'm still only in second year and more just thinking ahead right now, so I can't be too exact. Generally though, I know that security, anonymity and cryptography are big interests of mine.

Each person has an **even** number of rocks. At each 'tick', they simultaneously pass half their pile of rocks to the person to their **left**. After the tick, for any person that has an **odd** number of rocks, they will receive one additional rock to even out their new pile (so as to avoid fractions of rock to pass around).

*How many ticks does it take till all people have an equal number of rocks in their pile*? (if the number of moves is more than 100, than we assume it is ""impossible"").

Example (this a list of people's stack of rocks at the beginning of simulation, going in clock-wise order):

1000 100 10 2  (19 ticks)

I'm looking for thoughts on whether learning computer science or to code to some extent will open new paths for me in my current career or an alternative, but related, career. First, more about my background.

I have a BS in electrical engineering from one of the top US engineering schools. When I was a student, I didn't like to code so I focused more on the hardware side. (I satisfied the bare minimum C++ course requirement and did well.) Favorite classes back then were the math pre-reqs (calculus, linear algebra, stochastic processes), electro-magnetics, logic design, and MEMs. I didn't see myself working as an engineer so I went to law school and ended up working for a big law firm and specialized in patent litigation and patent prosecution. But I hated my job, particularly having to deal with clients, the uninteresting work, and also the really long hours. Ended up going in-house and have now worked at two ""cutting edge tech"" medical device companies, where my focus is on a variety of legal specializations, none of which require my quantitative skills or engineering / tech literacy.

Now, my legal career is going really well, and I could just leave it at that. But I can't help but feel that I am a bit bored and have untapped tech / quantitative skills that have lied dormant and are not being used. Computer science seems interesting to me since so much of the tech developments these days seems to be driven by software. Since I am happy with my career at the moment, I probably don't want to scrap my legal career to re-educate myself and become a programmer. The classic lawyer with quantitative skills often finds themself working as a lawyer in patent law, anti-trust or tax - but none of these interest me.

Questions:
1. Has anyone ever heard of lawyers learning computer science / coding to give them an added skill set to help give them a competitive advantage in their legal career?
2. If I want to learn more at a high level about computer science / coding to see which specializations interest me, how do I go about doing that?
3. How do I know if I'm ""good"" at computer science / programming?
4. Is it worth it to consider a MSc in computer science, perhaps online?
5. I'm also open to exploring other quantitative fields other than computer science that could be a better complement to my current skillset without having to ""reset"" my career.

Thank you very much for any suggestions!

## comprehending the world of pc is complicated sometimes. If you are not a techie person, there are several false ideas that you may believe about computers. These are really misconceptions concerning your PC. Because of lack of knowledge or old ideas obtained from a person, it's fairly surprising that there are numerous myths about your machine. This report examines some of the most typical computer myths, and might help you realize the world of pc better.

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Myth 1: To improve the speed and operation of the pc, it should upgrade the hardware. It's true that updating the part like the memory will enhance your Personal Computer, but it isn't always the case.

##  Aside from doing this, consider other aspects that cause your computer to slow down. These are undesirable programs, unclean registry along with other stuffs inside your computer. Therefore, attempt first to remove temporary files, uninstall unnecessary programs, clean the system registry and then defrag the hard disk before spending money for new peripherals.   Myth 2: A faster Personal Computer will boost up the Internet. Probably also this is true when comparing a 4 year-old pc hardware into a latest one. However in the majority of cases, computer is not really the major problem for poor Internet speed. It really depends upon your connection to the internet speed.

However, shouldn't these corporations seek to pool resources?  Would it better for the economy to keep them separated or would there be more jobs generated from a union of tasks between them, thus increasing revenue shares?  The biggest pros I see that could be generated are:

1.  Creation of an ""end-all"" language

Obviously multiple languages will always be used but when you look a defense contractors, they stick with ADA because you can literally utilize any type of paradigm and not stray from familiar syntax.  With that being said, the syntax requires day in day out use for it to be considered a go to language in that regard.

2.  ""end-all"" cloud implementation

This would be nice to have that one cloud technology that everyone could learn, which would allow for greater innovation within the tech.

3.  IOT and distributed systems hardware

These products could be made cheap and created with a ""throw-away"" model.  Obviously you would want people to recycle them.  However, furnishing your entiew home with automation for under $500 would regain the ""good ol' America"" feel for products.  Of course these products would be made in China, but the access is what would be nice.

Lisp
ReasonML/Ocaml
Erlang
Lua

My goal is to learn a FP that will help me in the most general sense, and will show fruits early on.

I've narrowed down to two: Lisp versus Ocaml.

**Reasons for Lisp:**

* Emacs - I can learn Emacs and use org-mode!
* Paul Graham recommends it
* It's supposed to make you a better programmer

**Reasons for ReasonML/Ocaml**

* ReasonML: perhaps this is the future of React, and I'm a frontend developer.
* This will be like killing two birds with one stone: another frontend stack + FP
* Ocaml is supposedly even used in financial sectors (Bloomberg for one)
* Ocaml can compile to machine code. That by itself opens up a lot of possibilities

**Reasons for other ones**

* Erlang: apparently this was in HackerNews recently due to Elixir being a secret tool for rapid development
* Lua: I have ESP8266 boards that use Lua as the language (I changed them to use Arduino IDE at the moment), and Lua is also a scripting engine for games.. so I maybe can make adventure games..?
* Haskell: apparently this is better for something but I forgot.
* Smalltalk: learned this in school. Maybe I can get started on SICP with Smalltalk?  :) ??

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose we have to design a NFA with the language `(0 U 1)* 000 (0 U 1)*`. Normally, I would approach the problem by first designing two NFAs, one for `(0 U 1)*` (Let's call it A) and the other for `000` (Let's call it B). Next I would concatenate the first and second NFAs.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, since the requirement is basically an automata ABA, is there a way in which I can go from AB back to A, or would I have to draw the final A automata separately (as once concatenated, the accept states of the first A are no longer accept states and are directed to the initial of B, in the automata AB).

So when generating random numbers we know that these numbers are really not random since they rely on an algorithm. However my theory is that we can use the randomness of how atoms vibrate and move to generate an output of their state in three dimensions to generate an output that would be a truly random number. 

If anyone has any ideas on if this would work or how we could make it work, please reply to this post its something i've been thinking about and it makes sense in my brain but I could be completely bonkers to someone who knows more about this stuff.

I enrolled my local community college for the Summer Semester for Cyber Security. With all of my transfer credits, I could finish an AAS program in under a calendar year, taking night courses. However, as registration date approaches, I'm beginning to become unsure about which program would be better suited for me, or if any of this is ultimately worth my time. 


I was initially considering Cyber Security, because this appears to a field with a good job market, especially in the public sector. Recently, the largest city in my state (Charlotte, NC) had hackers seize and hold ransom sensitive personal data. However, the course load for Cyber Security doesn't seem to be weighted as heavily in the fundamentals of computer science and is focus on more abstract concepts. I also don't know what kind of career opportunities are available with just an AAS. There is also an AAS in Systems Security, but I'm being honest when I say I don't understand the difference between the two.


There is also an AAS in Programming and Software Development, which looks like it just teaches programming languages. I have started in earnest to learn HTML and Javascript, and I think programming is something that I could learn fairly easily. If I stayed motivated and given the huge amount of resources out there, I might could probably teach myself what the community college is offering on my own. Although I think I would enjoy this course of study, I don't know if the program would lead to any career opportunities. Our CTO, has said that our County doesn't hire programmers anymore and as a County we are moving away from native programs (a lot of our applications are home-grown rather than licensed but this is changing).


Lastly, there is a program in Database Administration that focuses almost entirely on SQL. I know that our DBAs use SQL to manage the massive amount of data generated by the County. However, I don't know how much I would enjoy doing Database Administration or if an AAS would even carry any weight.


If anyone wants to look at the course catalogs just scroll to the ""I"" section - https://www.forsythtech.edu/courses-programs/degrees/programs-a-z/

Thank you for any input, it is appreciated. If there is another subreddit that I should post this to, please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: 

I am a university student graduating this June with a degree in mechanical engineering and would like to pivot to CS using a master's degree. I've heard that for the most part thesis-based options are to prep for entry to academia (which I'm not interested in), but other than that have very little differences with their non-thesis counterparts. I'm not against doing research per-se (did an undergraduate thesis, which I enjoyed), I'm just not interested in committing 4+ years of low pay as a PhD student.

&amp;#x200B;

Question(s):

1. What are some of the pro's &amp; con's of each option (outside of the difference I mentioned above)?
2. Where can I find metrics ranking non-thesis programs? I know for research/publication-based ones [http://csrankings.org/](http://csrankings.org/) is a useful tool, but haven't seen anything equivalent for course-based masters.
3. How much easier is it to get into a course-based masters? Are they respected in industry?
4. What is the best approach to satisfying pre-reqs/showing I can perform academically in CS? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some stats:

* Sub-par GPA for my undergrad (3.0, flat)
   * I haven't formally taken any CS courses though, except intro to programming (which I got an A in), so maybe there's an opportunity here to bolster my GPA &amp; explain the low grades in a letter of intent?
* Top 2 Canadian engineering school
* 1 3rd author pub in a top-ish engineering journal (pending, but 3/4 reviewers accepted w/ the last 1 asking for minor grammar revisions), opportunity to also get a 2nd (probably last author) pub
   * Though the field of study was a sub-field in mech. eng., my contribution specifically dealt with high-performance computing using GPU's
* Will be working full time @ AMZN (SDE1)
* Haven't taken the GRE yet, but I'm not looking to apply right away anyways, just wanted early insight

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest I had no idea what to do career wise, Ive always been interested in the  computer science degree but I always doubted myself and thought I could never get such degree. Something click on me and I realized that I was more than capable of getting this degree and well here I am with two more semesters to go to get my AS. 

I never imagined the amount of math one needs to take for CS but so far Im really enjoying the math. Im sure is about to get a lot harder but Im enjoying it nonetheless. I had ZERO experience in anything related to this subject so its been pretty challenging for me and-it seems everyone knows more than I do. 

Ok ok, here are the questions, sorry i felt like a little background wouldnt hurt. With my AS getting close to completion Ive started to wonder, 

what can I do with my Associates degree? Im currently working on a unrelated to CS job that is paying my bills. The plan I have in my head is that once Im done with my AS, I want to get a job related to CS to start getting experience programming/developing as I work on my BS so by the time I finish my bachelor, I have at least couple of years working on the filed; but how realistic is that? Am I being naive? Are there jobs out there where I can get hired with an AS and start getting a feel of the career?  

Now, is a bachelor on CS enough to set you up for success on the field? or is this one of those careers that you must at least get a master or a concentration on another related subject to be able to succeed? Kind if like psychology or kinesiology. 

If so, what should I focus on besides my CS BS? Im open for whatever at this point. But for sure needs to something stable and consistent. I really like the AIs studies, I happened to find them fascinating. I also like the idea of Cybersecurity, seems very interesting. Im also into art, so maybe some game development sounds good but I understand this is a though industry to thrive on not very lucrative unless you are a badass. 

And lastly well any general advice on whats to come for me before during and after my degree completion.  What should I expect out there? How hard is it to find a good paying job? How much does it usually take to solidify your career on the field? 4 years? 5 years? 10? 

If you made it all the way to this point, well thank you for taking the time and for the advice (if any) its 12 AM and Im tired I gotta go to sleep. I apologize if my writing is all wacky. Im typing all this on my phone half asleep. I hope I was clear and made my points go through.

I feel that too few people understand how to protect their information online, how their data are being used by companies and by governments, how current and future technologies will affect them in the future etc. Logistics aside, is it reasonable to make computer science literacy a requirement for high schools (or at least at my high school which has the resources to do so), and if so, what should such a class cover? I just began looking into the topic and I hope to get some starting points here to guide my research.",6,1

I dropped of university because my family wasn't financially stable. I could barely get enough money to cover rent from my parents so I started my own side hustle; fixing laptops, writing short codes, basically anything concerning a computer, I was the guy you would call.
I was studying Software Engineering and was entering my final year when I had to pause uni and return home to my country. 
When I came back home to my country, I thought I could work with my knowledge and make some money while waiting out this whole issue but unfortunately it didn't go as planned. 
Eventually I realized it was going to be very cumbersome if i wanted to study abroad because the tuition increased drastically across most European universities.
It's been almost three years now and don't tell me, if I probably enrolled in a university then, I would have graduated by now. True but unfortunately the quality of education Africa has to offer is not as practical and immersive like the European universities. And if I want to continue where I left off, then I would have to apply for an any European university and transfer my credits. Unfortunately I can't do that here in Africa. I might have to start at fresh but that's not that case.
So hear me out, I'm not here looking for money or anything like that, nah. All I want is some advice and directions from the top ""IT gurus"" on here. I want to start something in programming, HTML or anything in line with my studies. It's's been so long I don't know how to even start or where to start.
At the moment I make logos, edit pictures and do any digital art work for money but it's not enough. I need to up my income because I'm not getting any younger. I'm going to be 30 in may, so I really need to get my sh#t in order.

&amp;#x200B;

I first heard about the Tor Project in 2011, I believe. Back then it was referred to as 'The Onion Router', and was presented as a privacy tool with the capability of protecting free speech even during censorship attempts from dictatorial governments anywhere in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Around that time, I heard about the Tor Browser in the context of the so-called 'Deep Web', where you could find some texts, transcripts, leaked information... and you could also, allegedly, buy drugs, hire hitmen, and download child pornography and all sorts of paraphilia. I always assumed the hitmen thing was an exaggeration by the media, but the other things certainly were there.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to June, 2018. A government crisis is happening in Venezuela, and the local ISP successfully blocks access to the Tor Network, including its obfuscated bridges, for at least 2 months straight. It is unclear to me why the blocking started and why it eventually stopped. Apparently it happened again in January, 2019, but the point is that, when Tor had a good moment to shine for Venezuelans, it was defeated by the government. In other words, the best reason for Tor to exist, in spite of all the crimes committed under its anonymity, failed to justify its existence.

Would it work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/b26zdk/idea_for_computing_complex_functions_efficiently/,booleanReadIt,1552840539,"I have an idea how you could compute many complex functions much faster, but in cost of memory.

It works like the following:

You pre-calculate all (important) values and save it. Later you can just read the value from a specific adress instead of calculating it again.

This is a fictional code example in c++, just to show you how it could look like:

#include &lt;cmath&gt;

int main() {
  double resultBuffer[10000];
  
   // saving every square root between 0.01 and
  // 100 in 0.01 steps

  for(int i=1; i == 10000; i++) {
    resultBuffer[i] = sqrt(i/100);
  }
  
  // calculating the result of the square root of
  // 63.29

  double exampleResult = resultBuffer[6329];
}


I know this code is not great and could be implemented much nicer but I think my idea is clear now. Also you could tweak the amount and density of values to your needs.
I also know that this method wouldnt be useful in every case, but I think in a lot of cases it might be a good solution because its faster to just read one value instead of doing complicated math.

Now my questions are:
1. Is this method actually fast or are there any huge downsides, which are the reason why this isnt used already?

2. Is this used already? Maybe this already is a widely used technique and I just dont know.",5,1

I am currently taking this algorithm course with a professor who I dont have the best history with. Last year, a friend and I worked on a lab together and our code was similar. We got accused of cheating so she made us sit in the back of the class separated from each other. While everyone else was flying by through everything because they had someone to work with they didn't get in trouble. Yet, they still looked at each other's screen and had similar code. I know this for a fact because I've heard people admit to it. I then realized I shouldn't keep computer science as my major so I switched into cyber security. I felt like my dreams were crushed. I would leave that lab early because I was also dealing with a health condition that made me very fatigued. I had anemia, which is a blood disorder. I would then finish the lab back in my dorm because I felt like I was pressured in that environment and ashamed.  I enjoy cyber security much more and I hope to work in the aviation industry doing cyber security work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worry a lot this may have to do with the way I present myself. I am very feminine and social.  Back when I went to vocational high school for IT, there was a couple of female teachers who told me not to go in the IT shop because of me being a girl and my femininity. So this is where my fears are stemming from at this point.   I have no issue being different, in fact,  I rather be myself than a copy. I am very passionate about technology and I truly believe you can be feminine and very good with computers. My looks shouldn't have to judge my intelligence.  I know it is probably irrational fears that I should get over. But with the past I had, it is very hard to overcome it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel very discouraged in the class I am taking with this professor. Its a hard course and its driving me insane because it makes me question what I want to do in the future. I feel like I'm not good enough sometimes and I can never prove this professor wrong or actually show her I am a good student for something that happened a year ago.  I know I am different than the people in my class, but as I said earlier, it doesn't determine my intelligence.

And after going through 4 years of a job rut, I've been thinking of going back to school to follow my childhood dreams of developing video games. When I was still an undergraduate in college, I was originally working toward a Computer Science degree but due to personal issues, I switched over to Business. Now that I'm older and am in a much better state of mind, I want to return to school and get a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The problem though is that a lot of the colleges near me aren't offering Computer Science as a second bachelor's program because the major is so impacted. And another issue is the lack of financial aid that I'll receive because I already have a bachelor's degree. My plan is to enroll in my local community college this year and get my associates in Math and Computer Science (consisting of classes in Physics, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, C++ Programming), then next year I would like to transfer to a 4-year university to get my bachelor's in Computer Science, but due to the lack of financial aid and second bachelor's programs, I may not be able to do this.

I have considered going to coding bootcamps after community college instead of transferring to a 4-year university, but is it realistic to find a job in the video game industry after graduating from a coding bootcamp?

Would it also be realistic to get a job in the video games industry with a bachelor's in Business and two associates in Computer Science and Mathematics alone? Thank you for your time.",4,0

At my uni we're given two options, each to be selected from a set of four modules. The first one was an easy pick, but for the second one I've been absolutely unable to decide between Graphics and Networking. I have a strong interest in both, and see them as very important skills to have both for personal projects and career prospects, making it very hard for me to make a choice. I also checked to see broadly what kind of content is covered; graphics would be real time 2D graphics written in C++ and OpenGL, working (I believe) to produce a simple game. It shouldn't be terribly maths intensive, mostly just vectors and matrices I am told, and I see myself as a competent programmer so I am sure I'm capable enough to handle it. Networking looks at OSI and TCP/IP protocols, with the final project consisting of making a Skype like chat app with Java. I understand that no one here can tell me ""what the best module is"", or what I should directly do, so my questions would be...

- What kind of job/career would each module be better tailored too?

- Is this a situation of one being softer, or another more respectable? (could I teach myself the basics of one over a summer?)

- Are there any factors I should consider about myself when choosing? I'm sure I'd enjoy both.

- Does it really matter that much?

We previously spoke on the first phone screen regarding to compensation and she said it's around 90k-95k, so during the call, she asked me again to state a salary so that she can state it on the offer letter. She also mentioned bonuses as well and I said I'm okay with that range and above as well. She said she would get back to me a few days ago but ghosted on me after I sent her a follow up email.
I am thinking that maybe the hiring manager did not think I'm worth that much so he is considering other candidates but the recruiter told me the team can't wait for me to join so I'm confused. Also, the recruiter gets back to me pretty fast usually, so I'm thinking maybe there's something to do with the hiring manager.

In the degree, I've learned all the regular master degree concepts, so not a novice.

In the PhD, I've developed several projects on my own or in limited collaboration to a proof-of-concept stage to demonstrate certain research questions (for instance, creating an operating system for embedded devices that is multi-tenant secure through software).

During the PhD, I often wrote code as a means-to-an-end, just for myself. The coding was almost exclusively done in Python, Java, and C. So there was not a lot of focus on clean design, more advanced development/architecture, working as a part of a bigger team. As such, I'm afraid that I am now rusty in essential skills for a more 'conventional' job.

I'll start work in a couple of months for a services company that focuses on IT automation. They basically send consultants that help run a companies IT workflow automatically so that their services and processes are run more effectively. They do this through regular cloud management and automation tools. Now they want to go for a new self-developed product that enables this efficiently, and so integrates or uses Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Packer, Azure, AWS, ...

During the PhD, I developed a similar framework as part of research and I will become the responsible person for developing the product.

I'd like to prepare for this as well as possible. Given my background, and what I'll be doing, what tutorials, guides, etc can you recommend that can help me tackle this? It is a bit of an open question but I hope you can suggest several worthwhile resources.

Edit: Summarised, online free sources that help improve skills a Master CS/PhD guy might lack or have not developed once he enter the industry job market (in an automation IT context).

This is a technical book about popular ""non-yet-classical"" space-efficient data structures and fast algorithms that are extremely useful in modern Big Data applications. It took a loot from Computer Science but is not targeted to scientists only, rather software engineers.

It covers the state of the art algorithms and data structures that help to handle such common problems in Big Data processing as *membership querying*, *counting*, *stream mining*, and *similarity estimation*.

* **Membership querying** (Bloom filter, Counting Bloom filter, Quotient filter, Cuckoo filter).
* **Cardinality** (Linear counting, probabilistic counting, LogLog, HyperLogLog, HyperLogLog++).
* **Frequency** (Majority algorithm, Frequent, Count Sketch, Count-Min Sketch).
* **Rank** (Random sampling, q-digest, t-digest).
* **Similarity** (LSH, MinHash, SimHash).

While it is impossible to cover all the existing amazing solutions, this book is to highlight their common ideas and important areas of application.

The book is available in both E-book and paperback formats. You can get a free preview and all related information about the book at [**https://pdsa.gakhov.com**](https://pdsa.gakhov.com/) or directly at Amazon, of course.

If you have any questions or feedback, just ping me here or via Twitter @gakhov.

About Me: I am a 19 y/o Male who grew up in a small town and has a love of computers. In regards to computers: I know more that your average person but less than any experienced individual

My whole life I have loved computers and so naturally as my time in high school came to an end I looked at computer science as a career option. The only issue was that I never really knew what computer science was/is. 

This semester (freshman year, spring semester) I had the amazing chance to take my first true CS class. Its an intro to JavaScript class and I was nervous as all Hell when it started. 

Some classmates seemed like they could code with their hands behind their back and eyes blindfolded and I didnt even know what a Boolean was. For the first 3/4 weeks I was loving everything that I was learning but still scared about what I could do with it, how I would become better, what it actually did, etc. We are now 8 weeks in and I am IN LOVE with the problem solving aspect of coding. Being forced to use what I have been taught - and problem solve with it - has really helped me actually understand what everything is and, its function. 

I am still by far and large a beginner but, I am on Cloud 9 every time I start an assignment. I look forward to the long journey that is ahead of me and come for general discussion, advice, and fellowship. Lastly, I look forward to potentially working with some of you in the future! ",3,3

Recently, I published a post to announce my new book in computer science domain. I found it useful to the community since it for the first time covers set of probabilistic algorithms as a class, instead of looking for them in different branches. This is my book, so I promoted myself that now is considered as the violation of advertising rule. 

However, after some hours that post was 95% upvoted, has much more above the average of upvotes, that indicates a community interest, as I can understand. 

This, is this SPAM and has it to be removed? 

The problem that I ""advertised"" myself, meaning that if I ask my friend to post same post, will it be automatically become non-SPAM? Does it make sense?

I think, we have to do something with the rules of the community to actually support such posts, not penalize them.

Instead I can post an average question how to solve a simple nobody-cares problem from 5th year school or ask which class to attend in my graduate school ... Formally, they not SPAM, but actually they produce a noise and shift the group to completely different direction.

I would really like to hear that you think about such dilemma as ""rules"" vs. ""community interests"".",4,2

This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

Im have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, heres a video I made covering these topics: 

https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Dont send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - youll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note: 

\~\~\~

Hi \[persons name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and Im an  \[type of engineer\]  in \[location\].

Im reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below. 

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]? 

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after theyve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they dont respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company. 

If youve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if youd be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isnt absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If youve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you wont make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if youve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and youre ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. Theres a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy! 

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name

2. Position Name

3. Contact Name

4. Contact Email

5. Contact LinkedIn

6. Date of Last Contact

7. Job Source

8. Job Posting URL

If youre not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. Thats what will ultimately start you on your journey. ",21,101

I wanted to apply as a CS major because I interested in technology, enjoy video games, enjoy playing around with programs that modified things, and of course I enjoy a lot of money. This is a problem now because I was accepted into a top school (UC Santa Barbara) but they didn't put me in computer science, instead I was put in a math major. This is my 2nd choice school and I don't know if I should still consider this school since it didn't admit me into CS, and I heard it's difficult and takes a long time for someone from a different college inside the university to transfer into Computer Science.

Therefore, I need help deciding if CS is the right major for me or should I attempt another major.

Things I want from my major for sure: High earnings and high job opportunities for the major.

Info about me:
1) I like to offer advice to others
2) I like to find faster ways of doing things
3) I like numbers and detail-oriented
4) I like math and figuring how things work
5) I'm interested in technology and learning how computers work
6) I enjoy working with people
7) I am very ambitious, persuasive, and love coming up with my own ideas 
8) I feel I have a strong work ethic (was able to go from 312lbs to 160lbs)
9) I like money 
10) I like video games

I choose this field because I always enjoyed electronics and coding and felt like this would be a good middle ground. I got pretty good marks up until now and received a few internship offers for the upcoming summer.
Here is where the dilemma started as I had to decide between the two main offers. One offer was for a smaller company that was using mostly Microsoft products and would teach me a lot about .Net, SQL, Azure, and others they mentioned but I can't recall right now. Basically, it would have given me a background in a lot of the most common and marketable programming skills on the current market. The other company that gave me an offer, however, used more lower level coding and more in line with computer engineering. They stressed skills in Linux and C++. Long story short, I ended up going with the second company. They were a bigger name in the industry, much closer to my home, and they offered higher pay. Now looking back, I am debating where I want to go in the industry.
I always said I wanted to build and code robots (I am always playing with my Raspberry Pi), but I don't know if there are as many jobs in this area of computers as in software. My question is (finally I know) would the skills I learn from this internship in lower level computing still be applicable if I want to apply to the big names (Google, Amazon, Facebook) or any company that would have more traditional solely software oriented projects?

I want to do data science/analytics or UX Research/People Operations at a tech company one day. Although Google may be the dream, I really like this type of path.

I applied to Sociology for all my colleges because I was on the fence/I might double major in compsci and sociology but realized I shouldve applied for CompSci since its the harder major.

In the big schools I applied to, if I get in itll be rare if I can change to a compsci major said most admission departments but most offer statistics and data science and applied mathematics. I have also planned to go and get a masters for compsci if I follow through because I think thats whats needed to break into the big leagues. I have no CS background because Ive been stuck to other ECs to commit time but really want to try in college.

So I have few questions if u could help me.

1) if I pursue a masters in CS is there any other undergrad major besides CS thats good? Do I have to major in CS as an undergrad in order to get a masters in it? Whats the next best thing?

2) is a masters really needed for compsci? Will getting a masters differentiate my job outlook? Is CS more about the experience and I should start working ASAP after undergrad?

3) If I cant get into the CompSci program, would applied mathematics, stats, or data science be the next best fit for my ambitions?

4) unlike others I havent done CS forever but want to work hard and be a competitive candidate out of college. What do you recommend I join/do/apply for throughout undergrad to develop my CS skills and help my resume?

Thank u!

My goal is to start up my own business (a game) and develop it over time while I'm finishing my bachelor degree. Then depending on my business's success I might dedicate my life for this project or continue with a masters degree in cs. I have 2 big concerns:

I transferred to a top 25 CS school from a community college last semester  -- prior to this I had a ~3.7ish GPA at the community college. 

Unfortunately, when I transferred, my cumulative GPA reset back to 0, and last semester some pretty significant health issues resurfaced for me. I was unable to medically withdraw for financial reasons and had to power through the best I could. As a result I wound up with a 2.7, which I don't feel is indicative of my motivation or abilities. I have three semesters left at my new school at most, so I'm starting to feel like I might be screwed when it comes to jobs. 

I should hopefully be able to get it up to a 3.5 in that timeframe, but I'm also exceedingly nervous about finding internships this summer. My GPA here will probably be back up to a 2.9-3.2 by the end of this semester at most. Would it be wrong to include the community college classes in my cumulative GPA when job applications ask? Should I apply to internships anyways and just explain the situation with the transferring and the health issues?

So I'm on my path to self study (theoretical) cs, and I wanted to go like this:

1. Logic
2. Discrete math / Abstract algebra
3. Theory of computation / automata / formal languages
4. ....

I  just downloaded some notes on a logic course for a 1st year cs student  and it says discrete math is a prerequisite for this course. Moreover on  the book ""Logic for cs"" it says graphs and languages are prerequisites.

The  book I chose for discrete math is ""Rosen; discrete math and its  applications"", whose first chapter is about logic and proofs.

So now I'm wondering if I should study discrete math first, and if my list is in the correct order.

I thought I should go with logic first because in discrete math there are proofs to do, so logic seems to be a prerequisite.

bids at any time during the auction. Before the auction starts, the sellers place their items in the sale

room with a unique number attached to each item (item number). The following details about each item

need to be set up on the interactive auction board system: item number, number of bids, description

and reserve price. The number of bids is initially set to zero.

During the auction, buyers can look at the items in the sale room and then place a bid on the interactive

auction board at the sale room. Each buyer is given a unique number for identification (buyer number).

All the buyer needs to do is enter their buyer number, the item number and their bid. Their bid must be

greater than any existing bids.

At the end of the auction, the company checks all the items and marks those that have bids greater

than the reserve as sold. Any items sold will incur a fee of 10% of the final bid to be paid to the auction

company.

Write and test a program or programs for the auction company.



Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data, data must be

validated on entry.



Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.



All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.

You will need to complete these

three

tasks. Each task must be fully tested.

Task 1

 Auction set up.

For every item in the auction the item number, description and the reserve price should be recorded.

The number of bids is set to zero. There must be at least 10 items in the auction.

Task 2

 Buyer bids.

A buyer should be able to find an item and view the item number, description and the current highest

bid. A buyer can then enter their buyer number and bid, which must be higher than any previously

recorded bids. Every time a new bid is recorded the number of bids for that item is increased by one.

Buyers can bid for an item many times and they can bid for many items.

Task 3

 At the end of the auction.

Using the results from TASK 2, identify items that have reached their reserve price, mark them as sold,

calculate 10% of the final bid as the auction company fee and add this to the total fee for all sold items.

Display this total fee. Display the item number and final bid for all the items with bids that have not

reached their reserve price. Display the item number of any items that have received no bids. Display

the number of items sold, the number of items that did not meet the reserve price and the number of

items with no bids.

And yet, I still want to do it. CS has always been on the table since all of my friends are in either CS or engineering, and Ive really enjoyed the basic engineering coding Ive done for classes in the past (MATLAB, C and python), and that was because those classes were easy (CS159, ENGR132, PHYS172, ECE264 before I had to drop it due to schedule issues) and I really understood and could teach the material to my peers. Im concerned about how going into CS would be, as how hard it is and if I could succeed in it. I only have a broad understanding of what CS majors do, and CGT was also a consideration, but I would really want to do something for UX design, and end up working for a media/gaming company in some fashionon projects, systems, anything. I have a more successful background and interest in art and math courses, but I really value coding and debugging as a skill and would think a CS or CGT degree would be more appealing than CompE or EE.",12,3

I am a 3rd year CS Student with no internship lined up for this summer. I have had &lt;5 interviews with tech companies (I have applied to 40+) and I have gotten washed out before the technical portion or even flat out rejected immediately (Which tells me I need more projects/things on my resume). I have come to terms that I will probably not have an internship this summer.  This has negatively affected my sleep and psyche to the point that I am angry of my circumstances and I want to make things better for myself by finding productive things to do this summer. I want to do more software engineering and possibly Full Stack development in the future. I am interested in hearing any suggestions of things an unemployed CS Student can do.

&amp;#x200B;

The things I hope to do this summer are:  
\-Build a smart mirror (Because it looks cool)  
\-Finalized my Website soon (so I track my progress, be more than just a resume, and inspire others to keep on going.)  
\-familiarized myself with Arduinos (diversify my skill set)   
\-Take online courses of the specific aspect of CS that I like(probably without the certification because I am broke).

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I have a very dark fear of struggling to seek employment after college because I do not have an easy entry point like an internship to squeeze myself through. I am almost done with my degree and I feel competent but I can't land an internship. If I am struggling with getting an internship, I fear what will come for a real entry level position. ",8,1

526,2019-3-26,2019,3,26,3,b5e4j3,"If An Instance Of An NP-Complete Problem Has Valid Solutions Then ""Is There Only One Possible Solution?"" Is Easily Determinable",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/b5e4j3/if_an_instance_of_an_npcomplete_problem_has_valid/,IDEAL_TECHNOPHILE,1553537226,"In college I worked on an algorithm to play minesweeper. The algorithm was able to successfully play minesweeper games in polynomial time, and determine if there was a solution that could be determined from the configuration. For example...

    0 0 1 ?
    0 0 2 ?
    1 1 1 ?
    ? ? ? ?

Could easily be determined to be and only be:  


    0 0 1 T
    0 0 2 F
    1 1 1 T
    T F F F

However if there were multiple possible solutions based on the known data. For example...

    1 ?
    ? ?

The bomb could be in any square. Therefore no human or machine could determine a precise solution because there are multiple possible solutions, even if there is one solution with more data, this solution would just be ""could not compute a single solution"".

\---

Quick Disclaimer: The reason this doesn't solve Minesweeper Consistency Problem is because attempting to find a single solution assuming there is a solution would return ""could not compute a single solution"" even if there were multiple solutions...  


    ? ? ? ? ? ?
    ? 3 2 2 3 ?
    ? 2 0 0 2 ?
    ? 2 0 0 2 ?
    ? 3 2 2 3 ?
    ? ? ? ? ? ?

In this solution there is no possible solution, but since it can't determine one solution, it would again write this off as a could not compute.  
\---

What this means is that if you take a starting configuration of a 3SAT problem for example (variables v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7,...,vN) and assign them to a positive or negative truth values, and then create constraints `(V1 v V2 v V3)` that all meet these requirements, then you should be able to compute in linear time whether there is one solution that the problem constricts to, or if the same set of constraints also allows another solution. I haven't looked for an algorithm particularly to do this, but since 3SAT is reducible to Minesweeper Consistency, I would assume the same rules apply. If someone would like to confirm or challenge, I'll take it.

&amp;#x200B;

In short: Meaning if we assume there is a solution to an NP-Complete problem and it turns out there is exactly one solution that satisfies the NP-Complete problem, it should be easily determinable in Polynomial time, and I believe this holds true for all NP-Complete problems, since all NP-Complete problems can be reduced to Minesweeper Consistency Problem (also NP-Complete).

I'd normally resolve this with an iterative approach in code, but I can't help but think there's an easier way to do this. Like one monster of a SQL statement. Trouble is, I don't really know what to Google for.

I am currently enrolled in 12 credits, although it was 9 before midterms. In freshman year and sophmore year, things were going pretty well, only achieving Cs in my 2 physics classes and dong reasonably well in Calc2, Programming 2, and even Discrete Math(where I made a comback to get a B+). Everything started to go downhill in the end of 2017, where I had to drop 2 classes in order to lower my workload(I still ended up getting a D in one of them). I was extremely frustrated at myself, so the next semester, I said I would try harder. The issue was that in those days I had to deal with a lot guilt about having gone through a deconversion from my previous religion. It was a massive distraction which caused me a lot of anxiety. I ended up failing 1 class that term and decided to later take 2 classes during the summer. These classes were Logic and Computer Org.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, those distractions that were there before, followed me throughout the entire summer too. I also started to feel lonely because I cut off all of my friends. I was trying to reconnect with two people whom I was friends with,, but it wasn't enough. I got a D on both of those classes as Computer Org was a class that was fully online and involved a lot of reading on the computer(which I abhored as I MUCH prefer to read the material in print, which was not available as we were using something called ZyBooks, which included participation exercises that we had to do). I was really trying hard but the massive amounts of anxiety that I was feeling drenched my energy. To this day I still feel incredibly lonely, I speak more about this issue and others here\[ [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b33vvf/help\_guys/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b33vvf/help_guys/) \].

&amp;#x200B;

This semester, I took up 4 courses, but one of them was not going to begin in March: Logic. These other courses are:

&amp;#x200B;

Music Business(for my minor, a relatively easy course).

Programming 3(in C with UNIX, it's an OK course, but I really struggled on the 1st big assignment with pointers. I learned my lesson from that, but I had to spend more than 4 hours a day during the last week before it was due as I had procrastinate so that I could focus on the next class).

&amp;#x200B;

Natural Language Processing(NLP). This is a PHD level course intended for Grad students, but it is the one that matters most to me on a personal level. I am struggling right now, but I have spent so much time independently studying the material from the book(HOURS on almost a daily basis). It really frustrates me that I am struggling in this class because of the weird love I think that I am developing with this subject. I told myself that I was going to give this class my all, because it is a Grad course(just that us undergrads didnt have to do the project). But when I understand the material, it makes me want to go on for hours explaining everything that I learned. I get an immense amount of satisfaction when I get something right in this class. I actually dont mind reading the chapters. The only issue is that it takes me at least 2 hours to get through 10 pages in the book.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem is that I still have many internal struggles and insecurities which are distracting me from doing well!! I talked about them more in the link above. But currently, I am in a position many would consider to be strange. I feel like I shouldnt be struggling. This shouldnt be happening to me, which is making me feel hopeless for my future as a human being.",10,8

I'm a front-end dev on the project and a designer has recently been advocating for a Chinese-built design system.  To me the package seems innocuous but on the other hand I see security warnings in my console all the time regarding security patches for other seemingly innocuous packages (e.g. Lodash, etc.).  Since it's ultimately going to be my call and my responsibility for any outcomes that arise, I feel like I ought to dig into these considerations even if it turns out to be unfounded and I'm just not informed enough to currently know why.

Im a sophomore undergrad CS student at a no-name state school. Ive been involved in research early on and will be joining an REU this summer. I know Im interested in joining a CS PhD program after I graduate, and know its important to gain research experience when applying to grad school. Id like to go to a top 50 grad school for CS which makes credentials even more important.

I know I would like to study graphical computing at graduate school. My academic advisor told me that I need to commit to a focused research area; however, my college does not have any faculty who specialize in my area of interest. She told me to choose a different topic. The REU Im attending is on a totally different topic.

My question: is it true that I need to have a strong background in my area of interest to join a prestigious grad program, even if I dont have the resources to gain a background at my college? Wouldnt relevant coursework with research experience in other areas be good enough?

TL;DR When applying for prestigious grad programs, does it hurt to not have a ton of experience in your topic of interest? I feel stressed to commit to my research interest so early on in my academic career.

I would to seek advice from anyone who is willing to read this about my situation. I am a year 1 computer science student in a university in Southeast Asia. Before this, I had entered a polytechnic(not sure about what this is called in other **countries**, you graduate with a diploma after 3 years here) and graduated with a GPA in Diploma in Information Technology of 3.90/4.00, with distinctions in multiple technical modules(Operating Systems, Object Oriented). Between the diploma and my degree admissions, there is a gap year of 2 years due to conscription in my country. Enough of my background, here comes the issue I would like to seek help with. 

With my background from Diploma in Information Technology, I had admitted into a degree programme offering the Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science but have been struggling ever since(GPA 3.5/5.0 in first semester). While searching for summer internships, I realised a lot of companies do not care about academic results but instead focused more on portfolio and technical skills(practical skills and/or algorithms). This had left me in a dilemma regarding whether to focus on my academic results or skills that are testable.

To add to this, my experience in my current Computer Science course is terrible. We have to take up several electrical engineering related modules that are taught by our faculty professors(who doesn't specialise in electrical engineering). In our final year of our programme, we have to take up a joint module with computer engineering students to build a robot that navigates a maze.The robot is equipped with only a motion sensor and no hardware addition is allowed. We are organised into random teams of 8 people, 4 from each course and our academic performance for the module is ranked according to our performance in timing, with only 2 tries per group. This tries includes reattempts due to hardware failure.

Our mathematics are taught as 3 modules, Discrete Mathematics as 1 module, Linear Algebra + Statistics in another and lastly Calculus I + II and Series and Sequences. It also does not help that many professors who are good educators has left the university in order to join another much better university X. Quizzes, if any, questions often comes up to differentiate the elites, rather than just to test your knowledge. Practical project related modules, such as software engineering is a mess. 

This university X is a much well known university with better reputation in Computing and offering a Bachelors of Science in Computing. This university X will be recruiting twice the number of students in computing as compared to my current university in the next cohort intake. My current university has also been trying to take over university X's position in ranking. My experience with my current university is so terrible and stressful that I have thought of switching courses to a lower reputation university that if offering a joint overseas degree.

Regarding practical experience, I enjoy building software products and I did not want to specialise mainly in Software Engineering as it seemed too specific. I have had 3 internships with different organisations mainly building geospatial or location data related applications, will be taking a similar position in a drone company in a position to solve 

With that, these are questions that I have:

1) How important is academic results when looking for a full time job in Computer Science? 

2)Do you think I should drop out to enter a better/worse university? (Either University X or the one offering a joint overseas degree) Reasons for doing so?

3)What do you think I should do?

4)Advice on my perspectices in general related to this topic.",0,2

I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on a education and career path in order to become a datacenter engineer (or some career path where I get to play with servers).

Currently, Im studying Computer Science and History at A Level alongside a BTEC qualification in ICT &amp; Communication. (For the Americans, 11/12th grade I believe). Im on track to reach some universities which provide courses like a Computer Network honours degree or Cloud Computing, which I presume will be the obvious step forward.

My query is would a networking degree be a good one to go for, or is there another one which would be recommended. I know theyre all slightly different, but the consensus Ive gotten from browsing multiple universities is that they all cover basic topics and add there own custom topics in as well. After this also, what kind of job should I be aiming to get?

Furthermore, I was looking into a certification, the LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin), which I believe I would be able to achieve with a bit of studying. The reason why I think this is that I use Linux on a daily basis, ranging from my own PC (**i use arch btw**) and Ubuntu for web servers or Proxmox for a virtual machine host for example.  Is this something I should bother to achieve now, later or not at all, and is there any other certifications you would recommend?

I am not bound to a track once I choose it but it does determine professional development opportunities that will be immediately available to me (training, shadowing, certifications, approvals for other professional education).  

&amp;#x200B;

I am coming in as a Software Engineer I, and I plan on my immediate next move to be a Software Engineer II

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my choices for the ""tracks"" after SE2:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Stay on the engineer track (Software Engineer II to V).  III is a senior engineer, IV is a staff engineer, V is a principal engineer.  A lot of people seem to stagnate at the level III.  This track also provides the least high-level strategy out of all the available tracks, and that is something I enjoy.  This track might pay really well, however.  This track provides the least chance to be given an executive position (Director, VP, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

\-Join the Architect tract (Solution/Domain/Infrastructure Architect I --&gt;  Architect II --&gt; Enterprise Architect I --&gt; Enterprise Architect II --&gt; Sr. Enterprise Architect.  This track seems to let me keep in touch with my technical side, while being able to get strategy exposure.  This will potentially provide the most transferable skills and might be the most lucrative track.  I am leaning towards this track at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Join the PM track: Scrum Master/Process Manager I --&gt; SM/ProcM II  - --&gt;  Product/Program Manager I  --&gt; Product/Program Manager II --&gt; Director and so on.  This track likely provides the most strategy exposure with the least technical exposure.  I feel like I might have trouble switching companies  compared to the previous two tracks.  I also feel like this track \*might\* be less lucrative at the lower levels.  This track seems like more of a surefire way to get to executive leadership than the previous two tracks, however.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Join the Development Manager Track:  Software Engineer III --&gt; Manager   --&gt; Senior Manager  --&gt; Director and so on.  This track seems to potentially provide the most leadership opportunities.  However, it seems to move slower than other tracks, and I feel like a lot of people stagnate at Manager or Sr. Manager.  I think pay will potentially be less than the architect/pure engineer tracks until higher levels.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My priorities are 1) maintaining and building high market value (high salary and promotions within the company or have the ability to easily move out for better opportunities) and 2) exposure to interesting work (technical and strategic, preferably leaning more towards strategic).  Work-life balance is preferred.  ",0,1

I was always admiring all these people writing code and their creativity so I wanted to try it out for myself. My Dad got me the Java masterclass course and python bootcamp from Udemy, and a few hours in I could manage to write the code from nothing without any major struggles, but once it got more complicated my brain could not comprehend how to actually write it without having the teachers model and just changing the parameters, sometimes even with a model I just can't manage to write out any code at all if I don't just pause the lecture and just copy what the teacher is doing, sometimes I even struggle to follow. It may be important to note that I have a pretty severe case of adhd and have problems finishing whatever it is I start. And I always sucked in arts and crafts I was never created and drew really badly. I was wondering if any of you guys have had the same problems as me?

I guess my questions are should I be overly concerned? Are these employers just letting me down easy?  How long did it take for you to get your first offer?  Is there anything in particular I can do to distinguish myself from the rest of the candidates?

I went to a small school so we knew how professors would give exams/HWs and would like be able to accurately predict the types of questions that would be asked in exams from sample exams, past exams, etc. in other words, students at my school knew how to play the system to our own advantage and get pretty good grades. 

Now that Im in the real world, I realized that I dont know anything to the detail I should. Like I recognize terms and stuff, but I wouldnt be able to explain alot od stuff if a kid asked me stuff lol. Should I retake classes in community college or online? How much theory do u guys actually use in industry and for your work? ",8,0
