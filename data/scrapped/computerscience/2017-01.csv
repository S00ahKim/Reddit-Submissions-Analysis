I need to become a good mentor because I just accepted a position where part of it will be creating and leading a team to build a thing.

The best way I learn is to find a bunch of documentation and tutorials and read them and so it feels like people are being lazy when they expect me to do everything for them. I try my best to teach others but I get frustrated pretty fast if they don't understand, especially if they aren't even trying to learn things on their own. My ideal ""mentee"" would go learn about a topic and then ask questions to fill in their missing information.

But this doesn't work and I find myself increasingly frustrated that they won't teach themselves anything. It honestly feels like the people I teach are only asking me for help because they are too lazy to go learn things by themselves so they need someone to do it for them. Last time I had to teach people I ended up quitting because I was too frustrated with the process.

To keep it short, I've been in music school for ~7 years (I do have a Bachelor's from a Liberal Arts university) and I am considering pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. I basically feel that I have untapped analytical/problem solving skills that don't necessarily give me the competitive edge in music performance but could help me leverage a good standard of living in a field such as computer science. That, and I'm always thrilled about the prospect of learning new things.

I've checked out the archived thread so I understand I would have plenty of catching up to do in the math department, but was searching for some perspective on the job side of things.

1. How is the job market for Master's of CS graduates? Curious in terms of demand as well as diversity of jobs/employers. Is there a lucrative entrepreneurial path for a CS grad?

2. Is your work dynamic and interesting? Would you be easily replaceable by a peer or does your personal touch make a significant difference?

3. All other things equal, would someone with such a dense music background (B.M., M.M., post grad) and just a Master's in CS be seen unfavourably to a perspective employer?

I've been working with first year CS students for a few years now and I've gotten pretty decent at teaching a lot of the basics. I try to focus a lot on problem solving, basic coding style and techniques for the purposes of testing algorithms, intro to data structures, and other basic CS and programming topics. 

The problem I've run into, however, is that a huge number of students have very little or no experience with computers and technology. They don't understand file extensions, what an archive file is and how to extract it, what an operating system is, or how to download a compiler. They have a hard time understanding what programs to download, how to follow links, or how to do basic functionality in their web browser. I've caught many people trying to compile and run code while modifying it within an archive, losing all of their data because they don't understand network drives, or failing to submit early assignments because they never understood how to run a Python script. 

There are so many resources available online to teach programming and computer science. I'm pushing my university to start offering some of our teaching modules publicly to promote collaboration on course content. I just don't know of any good resources I can direct students to to gain these basic skills. I've been debating making a short zero level web series on the topic of *Basic tech things you need to know before learning programming* but that's a little ways off and I'm very interested in hearing if there are some resources available for the students struggling with basic tech skills so that we can focus more on the CS aspect than the tool aspect. For now, I'm pushing that we cover a bit more of the tools and basics in labs at the beginning so that students who already have a grasp on everything don't get as bored in lectures, but we can only do so much.

And right now I am starting my second year of community college, working towards an Associates in Science with a focus on CS.
My first year was dedicated to advancing math and working on less desirable pre-reqs (like the social sciences), so this will by my first quarter actually taking a dedicated college level CS class.

Now to the point of my post. Ever since I was in elementary school, I've wanted to study CS. What I really wanted to do, was join a video game development team. My parents supported my dream because they knew I enjoyed the hobby of playing video games.
Fast forward to now, I'm 20 and although I still love to play some video games and I think it would be a blast to help develop some, I'm not so sure it's the most fulfilling job I could get and be proud of. I mean, ultimately video games are just a hobby for people. They rarely hold any social/economic/geographic importance to our planet.

So I want to know what is the most fulfilling, societal beneficial, career a Computer Scientist could achieve?

PS: I'm not saying I wouldn't be happy with and love a job as a video game developer, or a software engineer for Amazon. I just want to know what's the highest purpose I could possibly achieve through Computer Science, and whether or not I'll ever achieve it is not the question.

I have considered computer engineering in the past, but have since decided engineering is just not for me. My true passion is mathematics (am currently in calc 3) however general mathematics is not a very realistic major as jobs are slim. So I was wondering if maybe cs might be a decent route for me. I'll be honest I know nothing about computers and aside from making a few simple programs in c++ using code blocks I have no idea what all this would entail. All I know is that I've seen statistics on the prospective job opportunities for cs majors and they look very comfortable. That being said I do enjoy computers and am fascinated with how they work from a math perspective. So what do you guys think, should I pull the trigger and go for it? Also any advice on ways to educate myself on my own on my own time, and what codes are good to start with would be more than appreciated.

I've had a rough trajectory trying to find out what I want to do for the rest of my life as a career field. To spare you all the boring details, I wanted to program. I became enamored with communicating with computers. Particularly, I want to program video games for a living. It took a while and a lot of learning and a professor that I owe A LOT to to discover this. 

Switched majors, at the behest of said professor, and here I am now. Truth be told, I don't really think highly of myself. It's why I avoided computer science altogether at first. I just didn't think I had it in me to be a good programmer or engineer, but it's the path I chose and someone thought I would do really well in it. Someone whom I look up to and respect a lot. 

I still feel like I'm not at a level that is satisfactory, from a knowledge standpoint. I still feel like a rookie, like I don't learn nor understand enough. It doesn't help that I'm not in a great school. The professors do nothing but talk and spend the rest of class time tapping away as we work on the ebooks. ""Here're your assignments, do them"". I fund my own education, so I don't have much of a choice.

To be completely transparent too, this is half my fault. I want to immerse myself in CS more. I have a shitty laptop so I can only work with small projects (I keep trying to save but every time I THINK I can buy a decent PC, something comes up that fudges all my plans). I made a positive move this semester by joining the CS club at my school and going to more STEM seminars and events. Still, what would you guys say I should do? More, I mean. I really want to immerse myself. I don't believe I'm smart, but I believe that I have the capacity to learn and understand more about something I genuinely enjoy.

Did some small script kiddy/c++/vb6/.net coding in my early teens for hacking online games. It kind of fell off somewhere along the line. Anyway, I'm a nursing student now and the more I think about my career choices -- the more I feel like I should be in computer science. I'm fascinated with automation, ux/ui design, and software that improves quality of daily life for commercial and personal purposes. I also read about how software developers have a very relaxed work lifestyle. I also read about how some people hate their jobs because of all the bullshit going on from the managers to the clients etc.. The lifestyle is the biggest reason I would want to go into CS. Being able to work on a project at my own pace -- as long as it gets done. Casual workplace environment and possibility of working remotely from home.   

I tried to start off on code academy, but it all seems so complicated. I watch videos of people coding in Java / c++ all kinds of languages and none of it makes any sense to me. The biggest thing holding me back from going into it is that I feel like if I went through my bachelors in CS I would graduate and still not know how to code. I understand that everyone has their own style of coding so that may be where things get confusing. I also searched through job postings on craigslist and indeed for CS. All of the jobs require some 5+ years of experience in dozens of different languages. From what I saw in my Uni's course catalog is that you pick a few electives in different languages. How does this effect job searching/placement for new grads?   

Did you know anything at all about coding/computers before you started the program? What was the learning curve/progression like for you? Did you graduate feeling confident that you knew what you were doing? Or was it more continuous learning as you found a job? Was finding a job easy as a new grad? ",18,16,False,self,,,,,

The job market for software development is more volatile than engineering (rapidly evolving technology and an increasing number of graduates entering the market). 

Ageism becomes an issue down the road.

Credentials aren't very important in this field - you don't really need the degree, so why invest your time and money in a credential that is relatively unappreciated. 

**CS pros:** 

The degree is easier. (In my subjective opinion)

Potential for very high pay right out of school. 

***

**Engineering cons:**

The degree is harder. (In my subjective opinion)

**Engineering pros:**

The credential matters and makes you more valuable by acting as an barrier to entry. (For many jobs you must have an ABET engineering degree)

More stable job market - not as much pressure to adapt to rapidly evolving programming languages and technology.

However I have run into an issue based around roundabouts, as we all know we can return to the same direction we have come from using a roundabout, due to this if two roundabouts are connected to each other cars may want to return the way they came, which can result in a deadlock situation, where cars cant return through the road that the user has designated, this can cause issues later on due to other roads which feed into this roundabout wanting to use the shared road between the two roundabouts causing a larger degree of deadlock.

My question is, how would I go about resolving this deadlock, I can try to figure out if there is a deadlock, but due to traffic being ever flowing a short time in what seems like deadlock may not actually be deadlock, which makes this difficult, If i use this method I will need a time where I check whether deadlock occurs, if I find that deadlock occurs do I pass the controls back to the user to try to fix the deadlock using a separate method?

It takes 6 credit hours for financial aid, and each class is 4 credit hours. So essentially I would have to take 8 credit hours. And they work on a quarter system, not semester, so I'm assuming it's a larger workload.

Seems fine, but on their page they say if you work more than 20 hours per week then they recommend only taking one class at a time; which would leave me without financial aid. 

I work 40 hours, but I think I would be fine. Do those of you that have taken computer science classes in a quarter format think it's unrealistic?

-Information systems (basics of databases and creating tables in ERwin)
-Administration and maintainence of systems (Done in linux(Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, most of the thing we did we did in terminal, and I know my way around Linux, I've also done some online courses in Kali Linux so I have somewhat of medium knowledge of Linux Terminal)
- Basics of programming ( It is programming in C I know my way around now bot nothing too advanced, I know how to handle files, structures, as my professor said we know basics of everything and the point is to combine it to something greater
-Organization and Architecture of Computers ( It's getting the idea of how a computer works with it's arithmetic and logic, inner architectyre of processor, parallel organization and microprogramming and assembler language (I got only basic knowledge in this class(6/10) so I am not so much into this since it's handling some stuff from years ago and not reall that interesting to me)
-Web systems and technologies

As an example, we were asked to recode the nextline() fonction, and had two weeks to complete it. I spent a week asking for help, and desperate as I was to be graded on it, went on github and had to copy the beginning of the code for me to understand what follows. I do not have any problems focusing, I love working with music as it puts me in a ""bubble"" where I feel productive, nonetheless my brainstorming never brings me anywhere. 

My teachers are very strict and since the majority of the school has a very good level in first year, I am considered as one of students falling behind. On top of it all, my parents will not allow me to do my first year again if I fail and don't seem to understand my difficulties even after many talks.

&gt; Virtual Memory :- a paging mechanism that allows a program to use more memory addresses than are available in main memory
  
I know what paging is (when a process is divided into equal sized pages and memory is divided into frames and then they are all simultaneously loaded into the memory), so do VM use this?

Let me give you a short background on myself first, particularly what I want to achieve regarding programming. I am currently a ninth grader and I've been interested in coding for a long time. I have some basic knowledge on C++ from our eighth grade computer science subject, as well as some proficiency in HTML, CSS and currently improving in Javascript (because of ninth grade CS). I however want to start making real mobile apps and computer apps. I am planning to use much of this year 2017 especially the coming months in preparing for several coding competitions both online and as a school representative. (Google Code-in is my dream, as well as some startup projects that I am considering to do) I am also an avid Linux enthusiast, as I am a full-time Linux user on all of my computers which I use for gaming, studying, and basic programming. My goal before 2017 ends is for me to be proficient enough in coding to make apps with a GUI, like legit apps and not just simple calculator apps. The problem I am having right now is that I do not know what to focus on, which is why I'm asking you guys for help. My initial plan as of now is to start getting proficient in C++, Java, and Python through books and ebooks as well as online classes on Coursera, edX, Udacity, and maybe even Youtube tutorials. I am willing to spend as much as 2 hours per day on pure coding just to improve my skills. My question is, are those three programming languages I am targeting to master enough to make me be considered a decent programmer? Like not just learn the basics, but by actually mastering them and dedicating time to training and practicing. With those languages, will I be able to make applications for Android and maybe even PC apps that are not that complex yet, but a little above the basic level?

Also, some additional questions. As I mentioned before, I really love Linux, and I since it is open-source, I want to at least give back to the community by eventually writing some code for it. If I want to understand the source code of Linux and its distros, what specific programming languages should I study and be proficient in?

I am sorry for taking so much of your time. Thank you reddit!

A couple months ago I posted here in desperation and did not bother to be mature about it, so here's my second attempt while adulting for once. I am telling you now that even though I started college in high school I still have no actual clue about all the screws and bolts of how I should pursue my education. Please have patience.

Fall of 2016 I officially finished my Associate's in Computer Science. I ranted about how little to nothing I learned from the college itself as it was mainly focused on C++ programming and not real life applications. In other words, it was as if I was being taught how architecture and engineering worked by using Lego blocks. Regardless, I decided the only way to fix this would be to actually do my own research and learn other languages on my own, as the Java and Assembly courses were completely rushed by an incompetent professor. I am currently learning PHP as recommended by a former classmate.

The real reason I am making this post is to see how you guys feel about Community College education in general. I do not feel like I have wasted my time anymore (saved a lot of money), as I said in the post I deleted out of shame, but I am beginning to question whatever I should continue to pursue a Bachelor's in this CC. They do not offer Computer Science as a Bachelor's, but they do offer Applied Tech (Computer &amp; Information Technologies) which I am really interested on. I have a good 75% of classes already done due to my Associate's. It is either this, or transfer to an University and pursue something like Electrical Engineering, or continue Computer Science. Still juggling stuff around.

I like to program, but it feels that so far I have been restrained to only using Visual Studio applications, strictly Command Prompt calculator apps and occasional games. I do not feel comfortable actually seeking internships (not provided where I live, unfortunately) due to feeling so inexperienced. This is the reason why I am thinking of other career paths, but if an University can actually teach me more than using Legos, I would not mind continuing Computer Science. Regardless, Electrical Engineering and CIT are other paths I am highly interested in.

Thank you for the patience so far, I understand if someone being as clueless like me can get irritating.

Anyway, since I'm not sure when I'll be able to go to college (tried to get independent status at a college for Fall 2017, denied), I figured I'd try to learn new things. Always had an interest in trying compsci, just never had the opportunity, and I'm just starting to learn the basics on Codecademy now. 

When I told my bf that I was starting to learn to code he got all pissy and said ""you're gonna be one of those"" ""we'll have nothing in common"" ""you have no direction"" ""good luck being a girl in cs if you major in that when you do go to college"", and my favorite, ""you going out to the library and coding as a hobby is really sad"". He graduated last may and was a polisci major. 

Obviously I'm still going to pursue coding because it interests me and it's not about what he thinks, but how do I get him to be more supportive?

I just started an internship through my college and had a couple of questions. Our group has a general goal of collecting data about user's browsing habits and we are looking for a couple of different options before we pick one to develop. The current idea is to create extensions/add-on's for all the popular browsers and then have the user's sign in so that we can send the data generated back to a single back-end system. For right now we are focused just on the desktop environment but eventually we would like to try to develop something in the mobile sphere of things, sadly only Firefox has mobile add-on support. The data we are looking to collect is stuff like:

 * Individual Page URL's
 * User's Actions (What is possible here? i.e. clicks, selections, mouse movements)
 * Site Content and Page Content (What website is it/What is on the page)
 * Time Spent on Individual Site/Page
 * Which page is gone to (Could we generate a map of the different pages visited?)

Another idea that was floated was a standalone application on both Windows and Mac that would collect this data without browser integration but I have no idea how practical that is. What are some technologies we could use to generate and collect this data? I just have a background with front-end web development through school so how would I go about learning what it takes to set up a back-end system that would universally accept the data we want to collect from all the different systems our users would use? Thanks for any time or consideration.",4,0,False,self,,,,,

Nevertheless, what meaningful things can be said about different approaches, how this may have changed over time, and on the general concepts of data and code?

My job as a data analyst is continuously pushing me in the direction of computer science. This is great, and i enjoy playing around with code and such, however i feel there are some serious gaps in my knowledge about computer science and software (and even hardware or electrical) engineering.

I would like to put myself in the place of an engineer designing the worlds first computers and languages, then move forward to see what we have today (I'd imagine this sort of thing is covered in undergrad cs theory courses or something). There is a lot that went on between 1940-1970 (and possibly earlier), that set the precedent for the computers we have today. There are terms, concepts, techniques, and so on, that are essential today that clearly reference systems implemented in computers decades ago. Operations in the old IBM machines, BASIC, etc. (no clue what I'm talking about xD )

How can i learn from the ground up, what a computer is, how it is made, how it is programmed, how things are stored, circuited, called, input, output, connected, everything. I know i may be jumping ahead a bit and it may be best to take things step by step. I don't mind reading, however if a fat stack of 500 page books begin to pile up that can grow quite disconcerting to me. So if there are lectures/videos or something of that nature, that'd be cool in addition. I'd like to be efficient and in the end be able to approach languages like C++, C#, Python, and hopefully some real deal low level languages, in a more enlightened fashion.

Any wisdom you guys could share? Perhaps there are better approaches? Simply taking an online class in how to code python doesn't really do it for me since I'm not really learning how to be a computer scientist, rather i just now know simple synthax for a language.

Since there's technically no more material, I was tasked with self studying [this algorithms textbook.](https://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/Book/Java3e20100119.pdf) So far, the first chapter has already been difficult enough for me to understand, and looking ahead, it's only going to get worse.

A little background:

I am 22 years old and I graduated with a BA in Biological Sciences with a Spanish minor. I decided that I hated biology, but graduated with the degree. I took a recruiter job with a staffing agency back in June 2016 and hate everything about it. Now, I am back in an online program for a BS Computer Science degree. It's supposed to take about 2 years to complete (flexible to complete, but this this makes the most sense for me). I'm only in the intro course now (C++ / Intro to Computer Science). I have 3 more terms for this year, and then it starts again with 4 more terms the following year.

So, 

* What is your advice on getting internships/jobs prior (and post) graduation? 
* What things can I be doing now in order to amp up my resume/portfolio for future reference?
* What can I be doing on the side to even make a couple extra dollars now/near future?
* What do companies look for in CS interns? Is it specific?

Thanks for any advice! I'm really trying to take this seriously and get the best advantage I possibly can now and post-graduation.
