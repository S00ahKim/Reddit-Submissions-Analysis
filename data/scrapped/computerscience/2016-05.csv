Compare advantages/disadvantages (in terms of speed, space complexity, arithmetic limitations) of the following designs:

(a) Look ahead carry, 1 level

(b) Look ahead carry, 2 levels

Here's my understanding:

Look ahead carry effectively increases space complexity to decrease the time complexity. By creating predictive carry values before the full calculations are made the next full adder can receive the carry earlier.

This is accomplished via more logic gates in the parallel hence increased space complexity.

The asynchronous adder has lowest space complexity, however, it has a drastic increase in the time complexity.

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student and am going to be interning for a big company here starting in late May. I am super excited, but also kind of nervous about it. I met my supervisor last month and he has been emailing me about some of what I will be doing over the course of the summer months.

Here's one of them: 

John,
I wanted to connect with you and let you know we are excited to have you join us this summer for an internship.  We are working through project assignments and activities and have aligned you with my team.  I lead our integration team for SAP which includes cross-functional SAP efforts, escalation and problem management, IT process and metrics, and working with our business partners and super users. We have a lot going on and are glad to have you join us this summer. 

Best regards,

My supervisor



Now my problem is this... I have not worked with SAP at all. In fact, I have rarely heard of it before he emailed me and I did a few google searches. However, I feel like I have learned a lot from the many classes I have taken at my University. 

Classes taken:

Java I            Operating Systems       Database Management Systems       Discrete Math for Computing
Java II           Networking I                VBA Programming in Excel              Data Structures with Python
Java III          Networking II               Computer Assembler/Architecture    Calculus I and II


As you can see I have taken no SAP classes. I have checked out a few books from the university library that are introductions to SAP, but from what I have seen it is a very broad broad field. I am not too worried because I informed my supervisor I have had no experience with SAP. He said that's perfectly fine and that the first week or two is training anyway. 

I am a good student with a good GPA and am a hard worker. Does anyone have any advice for me in what I can further do to get prepared for my first REAL job? Mowing lawns and laying concrete the past 3 summers don't count in the Computer world I'd assume :P I'm thinking some of the SQL statements and concepts used in my Database class will be useful? Any experts out there in SAP or Computer Science field with some experience that could help a young student out? Also any other advice on anything is great!

I've already seen those ""Thinking of Pursuing a CS Degree"" threads on the sidebar. I have additional questions. I, previously, have been studying the Computer Science subject in the Cambridge/British Council/O'levels system and I was kinda done with it.

I received credits for the latter due to my grade 9 report cards. I am not taking on Digital Design because it's divided into 3 parts and I can't finish all three in the next two years (I don't know much about it alongside the American education system). In grade 11 I will be taking Algebra 2 Honors, Psychology, United States History, Chemistry Honors, Creative Writing and English 3 Honors. Ive already completed most of  the Algebra 2  and Chemistry syllabus, so those two along with Creative writing and English 3 wont be a big deal. I ,however, dont know how to go towards Computer Science during this year and the next year. I want to take Calculus as well but Im sure if I can skip Pre-calculus and go straight into Ap calculus or something in grade 12. Most importantly, how do I go about dealing with Computer Science? I just started using Khan Academy for Computer Science and I discovered that its quite different from what we learnt (and more interesting!). I also found a website called Florida Virtual High School where I could possibly take AP Computer Science, now or next year, along with a variety of programming courses. I unsure about my future actions, please help me and give me guidance.

Extra info: I want to be some sort of Software developer. I'm also interested in web developing and bits of game development (Being a game developer used to be my main goal back when I was much younger). I also have similar but lesser interest in the hardware aspects of computers, but, Computer Science seems like a better choice for me.

Edit 1: I also found this super helpful reddit post which links to many different free online programming/CS courses. I am looking into them now

Description
Write a Java program to make a GUI of a bomb game. Locate a bomb at a randomly selected cell from a 10 by 10 grid panel. This game starts from any randomly selected cell except the bomb's cell. A user moves on the grid panel using the up arrow, down arrow, right arrow, and left arrow keys. This game stops if the user moves to the bomb's cell. When the game stops, it shows the ""Game Over"" message on a new window. This game also shows the score by the total number of visited cells.
 

Note
A part of the program is given below. Add lines where it is marked. You can also change the given part of the program if you want.

I'm a community college student getting my general education classes out of the way. To make a long story short when I was a junior in high school all I wanted to do was code. However, when I moved to another state I went to a technical college to major in computer science because I didn't get into any of the colleges that I applied to and my GPA was a 3.0. 
Anyways, after my first year of being in computer science I lost complete interest in it and I honestly could not stand it any longer. I regretted that I wasted my time there. Now, that I'm almost done with community college I'm thinking about majoring in Computer science again, but I looked into Computer Information Systems and I liked what they offered. However, I did more research on the job aspects of it and it just don't seem like a good career field considering the amount of people that said, CS was better. So now, I'm stuck at a lost as of what to do. 
Why should I go back into Computer Science and not go into Computer Information Systems? Any advice and stories would be helpful.
Also, I don't come from a wealthy family. My mom is probably the only wealthy one that I know. I'm trying to make her proud and not be poor like the rest of my family members are because I see them struggle a lot. Also, just a little background I still want to code, more likely build programs for companies and I still want to be a web designer/developer. I just don't know what to do? Any advice would help. I did take web designer classes in high school along with graphic design.

My understanding this far is that multithreading on a single core is a way to mask memory stall/cache miss/page faults by allowing execution of other independent processes to take place while a stall is occurring. Can anyone tell me if this is right? Also, what exactly is a thread? Does the processor automatically thread or do you have to manually specify it within your code? Also, how does multithreading work on multiprocessors? Is it generally utilized by allocating a thread to each processor?

It's 2:55 AM right now. I've been spending the last hour or so browsing social media when I wondered something. My current university offers only CIS (Computer Information Systems). There are other universities that offer CS (Computer Science). All of this time I considered them equivalent. Up until now and recent readings, I realize that they are similar, but not the same. It is unfortunate that I realize this now, but it is still very early in my post-secondary education that switching universities is only a minor set-back. I have only taken one full semester which was composed of the following: Statistics 104, English 105, English 108. Currently I am taking a CIS 145 course; I love it. My latest grade in Pre-Calculus 12 was a B (73% - 76% I can't remember). I think I pass the pre-requisites to be accepted to the other universities where Computer Sciences are offered.

TL;DR
I had no idea CIS and CS were different, and was wondering if it is worth changing universities in order to take CS instead of CIS. 

Any advice/help/contribution would be very appreciated.

Lately I've been using reddit (to get questions answered) to help make a career decision about working in the field of computer science or Information technology because of the information that's being shared and how informative the users of reddit can be.
When I was browsing the internet for IT certifications I remembered when I was taking a few IT classes at my technical college. They were talking about CompTIA, CISCO, and Microsoft certifications that were available at my school. I was in two courses that was going to prepare you for the CompTIA 801 exam. I did pretty well in that class. I was going to move on to the next course, but then I moved. Anyways, I was wondering are those three certifications only for the IT workforce? 
If so, are they any good now, since I've read that in CompTIA you have to get your certification renewed every 3 years, since it's no longer a lifetime certification anymore.
Is that true?
Also, what certifications are out their for Computer Science or do I just go ahead and work on a bachelors degree for it after, I finish community college and transfer into a university?
Because I know that their are certifications for Web Design, Web Development, Graphic Design, and Adobe Photoshop products. I was just wondering if their were any that was for Computer science itself?

Thank you, Please no condescending comments. I'm still kind of new to computer science!
Also, if you have any book recommendations for learning Python, C++, C# or just any programming language please share! I already know a good amount of Java language after practicing on my own. But Java books are still welcomed. 
Websites are useful to I already know about CodeAcademy, KhanAcademy, and Code.org
Any others would help!

Stories or advice about your day at work would helpful if you're working in computer science. What kind of work should I have in my portfolio (If it's needed besides my resume).
Thank you, again!

1. Arizona State University - BS Computer Science (ABET accredited)
2. Regis University Online - BS Computer Science (ABET accredited)
3. Oregon State University Online - BS Computer Science (Post-Bacc Program)

I currently work full-time and have to support my wife and new baby financially so quitting to go full time isn't really an option. However, I question whether an online degree will give me as good of an education or look as good on a resume.

I've already contacted each school and with the credits I already have, I'd have 84 left at ASU, 78 at Regis and 60 at OSU. OSU would be the cheapest, followed by ASU (assuming I take more than 12 credits per semester, which I'm not sure I can), then Regis. ASU's system is kind of strange. Their per-credit fee is, by far, the highest of all 3 universities at $744, but once you hit 7+ hours in a semester, the price stays the same. This really rewards full-time students because they can take 12 credits at $428.50/credit, 15 at $342.80 or 18 at $285.67... I'm just not sure I can do full-time right now, as I'd have to physically go to classes and since I work 8:30-4:30 every day, that severely limits the number of classes I can take in-person.

Coursework wise, ASU's coursework is, by far, the most math/science heavy. From what I can see on my degree audit, 16 credits I need are in math/science alone.

Which school has the best reputation and would give me a better chance of getting into a top-tier MS program, if I decided to pursue ML or AI after?



FWIW, I'm also considering just going into an MS program. Regis said I already qualify for their MS in Software Engineering, but upon looking at the curriculum, I feel like it really won't give me the education I want. I've seen others on here criticise it for not really being a true MS program and I'd tend to agree from what I saw. ASU will accept me into their program without a BS in a related field... but the list of courses I'd have to make up first consists of 13 classes that amounts to 39 credit hours.

I'm a community college student and I will soon major in computer science next Spring. However, I have been brushing up on my computer science skills, so I won't be completely lost. Anyways, every time I start studying computer science or work on small practice problems in eclipse with Java. I either get frustrated or highly bored. Especially, when I'm working by myself. But if I'm in a classroom setting I don't get bored and I feel like I have more energy which, I think is very weird because I usually have more energy when I work alone on my other projects/subjects. 
Do you guys ever feel this way about computer science or is it just me?

I love computer science and technology but sometimes I think it isn't for me. I guess, I feel intimidated by it sometimes.
Also, for the fact that I had took computer information systems first and I guess that has something to do with how I feel about CS. Because I think CIS was easier even though I got frustrated with it a little bit.
Any advice about how to deal with this so I won't feel like I have to switch my major when I start in Spring? I was also, thinking about taking three classes at a time. Even though, it will probably take me longer to graduate by doing that and that's okay. I just don't want to get burnt out by it.

This year, I'll be a junior in college majoring in Mechanical Engineering.  I've taken a bit more classes than necessary for a ME, including courses in C++ and discrete logic(graphs, nodes, branches, truth tables, proofs, basic encryption, etc.). I really do feel I have more of a CS brain than a ME brain, but to switch to a CS degree would not be practical. I also feel as if I'm missing out on a lot by not fully understanding computers. Like I wish I knew how to use Unix, how to do networking stuff, what a basic computer is in terms of things like raspberry pi, and Arduino, like basic controllers. There's a lot of books out there, and I wouldn't know where to go to get a foundation, so...

Anyways My question was could anyone recommend books on the following topics? 
What is a computer? What book(s) would help allow me to build, or allow me to understand in depth what Steve Jobs first made in his garage? Or what books would allow me to create, or better understand, in general, an Arduino or Raspberry Pi?

What is Unix? How do I use Debian?

What is Networking? How do I understand networking so much that I can see any file from any computer that is accessing my WiFi? Or so that I can get deeper into the TOR? 

How do I write Code that can will communicate with other computers? (networking) If I pick up some networking, does that mean I'll need to learn SQL?

Do i need any books on algorithms and data structures?

For mechatronics/robotics, will i only be using C and C++? will OOP ever come into play for robotics/mechatronics?

What else should i read up on?

Please help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/4lknvf/my_boyfriend_solved_an_engineering_question_and/,SweetCaroline555,1464533063,"My boyfriend is 21 years old, computer science major. I was on vacation for a week, and during that time we skyped and kept in contact pretty much every day. Tuesday night he believed he solved the P vs NP unsolved computer science question. He stayed up all night writing a paper about it, which I can't explain what he wrote because I know nothing about computer science. He seemed completely normal, just excited that he solved something that took a lot of thinking. The days following he would send me messages about stuff he was writing in his paper. I didn't think anything of them because I thought he was just super excited and on an adrenaline rush of information. He told me that he was getting sleep. He drove to work and his class completely fine, both of which are an hour away. Thursday night is when it started getting excessive. I would wake up to 30 messages at a time saying things like ""Stop processing the transfer function and the input i just said. Thanks now count in time with me please! Starting from scratch. Describe N- dimensions. (N-1). Start with 0 and end at me with memory. So we can remember."" I started getting more worried Friday morning; he called me and sounded really happy asking when I would be home and that I had to find him and he had to find me. His sister and mom texted me asking if I had talked to him. I explained to them what he's been saying, and they told me that he called his dad, grandparents, and even my boss, trying to explain the p vs np problem. He was shaking, pacing back and forth, asking where I was (even though he knew), and wouldn't stop talking about time and infinity. He threw his shirt into a canal, jumped in the water and destroyed his phone. He insisted it still worked and it just needed to be charged. I was told that at his house he would pick things up, examine them and question how it was made, then stated that he invented it. Also said that he knew how to win at the casino because he knew the probability and statistics of everything. While I was on the flight back home, his parents called EMS to get evaluated at home. He would answer their basic questions completely wrong, saying he got his degree at Harvard with a PhD, and said his birthday instead of what the current date was. He got taken to the hospital and was given 2 doses of Ativan, and when I finally arrived at 3 AM he was calmer. He hugged me, knew who I was, and asked if I knew what was wrong with him. He never would speak gibberish, just made comments that were incoherent, tested negative for drugs, and doesn't take any current medications. When I asked how he was feeling he said ""I can't shut my brain off, I need to share my information with the world"" I finally got him to sleep around 5 AM then at 7 AM he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Later that night during the visiting hours, we were told he was sleeping so we decided to try again during the next visit day. This morning I called him and if you didn't know him you'd think he was totally okay. He said the nurse and therapist talked to him, gave him medicine to keep him calm, everyone was really nice and he made a friend. I would describe it as a fake happy. He knew where he was, what he ate for breakfast, but something is still off. I've tried to look up schizophrenia and bipolar, but neither of those seem to fit. I know the humans only use 20% of their brain, and some people I talked to suggested he may be using certain parts that we don't normally use. Like he's on an acid trip that won't end. If anyone could share their thoughts on what this might be, a diagnosis, or therapies that might help, please share. He knows something is wrong with him, and that the meds that they give him make him calmer. But he still can't stop thinking. We think he hasn't slept in a week, so that, plus the adrenaline he's had made him have a mental break down. I appreciate any feedback. I just want my boyfriend back, not just calm because of meds, but back to himself.",34,28,False,self,,,,,
