The more I learn about these things the more I begin to realize how frighteningly advanced they are getting.

Dont get me wrong. I love it. Computers are fun. But there is also a very moral and philosophical aspect to computing. 

I just think that if we can get an AI to learn how to play a flight simulator in real time, adapting to various situations, all while hitting human targets from the air with laser assisted precision, we will have unlocked a horrible beast. 

Honestly, I really think we are 100% there already. Sure we dont have drones with feelings, emotions, deep conversational thoughts but it doesnt really matter. 

A drone doesnt need to be able to do everything on its own. It only needs to be able to do one thing effectively and precisely. That something could be taking down other aircraft within a particular zone, eliminating all human beings wearing a certain color or uniform, patrolling in a set perimeter for recon, alerting us of threats. 

I think video game AI lives proof that these autonomous tasks are well within our decade of possibility. We have AI now that can defeat experienced chess players at their own game (alpha Zero for example). 

AI can beat us in fighting games, fps games, and especially strategy games. There is little reason to believe they could not beat us at war games too. 

Imagine a drone is able to observe the world around it, and play it like its just another game. This is what im getting at. A drone that becomes better at piloting no matter how many times it crashes or gets blown up because its memories are cloud saved. Soon it can stay flying without hitting any obstacles at all. 

Then it views the entire world as one big sandbox game, and remembers every face, every place its ever been to because it has visual memory. Say the word, and the drone will fly its way back to that location at your command. It creates a 3 dimensional gps map of every piece of geography it sees, every person it sees, remembers the last location it saw a face, and relays that information back to other all the other drones. Now imagine thousands of these things flying around.

Oh, and the entire flight the drone will still have a human pilot observing the whole thing to make the more complex decisions. 1000s of them, each with a human to back them up from the ground. 

Just look at your phone. Look at that facial recognition. Look how easily it detects your heads even from far away. 

People talk about the possible risks of using AI as if the danger is somehow decades away. Really, the tech is already advanced enough to be considered terrifying.",0,0

But I have no idea how to reason about how expensive a given operation is.

* Like an if statement
* creating an object
* querying an object
* writing//reading from a file
* querying a database
* outputting to the screen
* getting data from keyboard//mouse

I wanted get some feedback on a couple of ideas about pursuing a master's degree in TCS.

First a little background information, I'm located in the USA. I have a BA in mathematics, a BS in statistics and minored in CS and Philosophy from a no-name university. I love mathematics and logic and dreamed of being a researcher, but I failed to receive a TA position so I decided to forgo my graduate studies for now as I don't want to accrue more student debt. 

While I love the idea of pursuing purely abstract fields I realized becoming specialized in something so far from application may hinder my chances of employment, either in industry or academia. After all I'm already having to take some detours in becoming an academic. With that in mind I've looked at something that's more applicable like continuing to study statistics/computer science.

Finally, for TSC I wanted to find master's programs in computational learning theory and or analysis of algorithms. I'm not looking for Ivy league schools or anything like that. I'm trying to find notable people within the field from less prestigious universities. So any information for this I'm all ears!",1,1

Some key tech we currently have that I think will make drones more deadly and advanced. 

-Machine learning AI that can fly autonomously without collision, or learn through flight simulators. (skydio drones)

-GPS systems to create a realtime map of the drones location at all times, set patrol areas for the drone to comb. 

-Facial recognition to remember every person it has ever seen and their last known location over gps. 

-High definition IR cameras to record previous flights, spot targets miles away, seek or pursue targets based on clothing, color, appearance

-Fast computer CPU to create a realtime 3 dimensional map of the world around it as it flies

Another big sign to me is how video games have advanced. With the right software, a drone might view the world as one big sandbox game, essentially behaving as an NPC tuned our liking. 

I dont think an AI needs to be 100% independent to be dangerous. It only needs to do one or two tasks effectively.

I am currently in university majoring in computer science and I am at crossroads here. Python and C++. I am really interested in game development. NOT the content of the game, but the stuff under the hood. I don't want to be a game developer. I just crave to look inside the hood.

I am learning Python for a data mining course and C for another course. I am breezing through the C course. I already know what the professor is going to talk about. And as for the data mine course, I am interested in it but not as much as C (or C++/low level languages).

Now the problem is, I want to be able to do couple of things in my career:

1) Get a job at a tech giant (Google/Microsoft/Facebook etc.)

2) I want to be the guy who knows the ins and outs of how a computer works

3) I want to be able to do anything the task requires me to do. Any task, when time is not the issue.

4) Work on something cutting edge, as opposed to maintaining legacy code.

5) Games have been a part of my life as long as I can remember. (I was born with a keyboard in my hand and an arch in my back XD) So, I want to be close to them.

And that's just my career. I have relationship goals, fitness goals, family goals and all of the other good things in life.

As I am in the university right now, I want to focus on my studies and get a job in the tech field. And this is where the problem comes in. C++ gets a lot of bad rap because of obvious reasons (too much to learn). But no one recommends it, they say ""Learn Java"" or any other higher level language and be easy on myself. That's where Python comes in. It is easy (comparatively), all major companies accept it, AI and Data Science is big deal, and it works well with C++ ecosystem.

I am an international student and I am restricted in my job choices. I can only aim for big companies and be really really good at what I do or I get nothing.

I want to do game engine development (which I belive is not possible for me being an international student on F1 visa or H1B later on), systems programming and all the low level stuff which is where my interest lies. On the other hand I want to get a job when I graduate. In short, I have time constraints.

I should not be learning two languages at a time as experienced programmers say that it is a bad idea. But, is it? How should I go about in my situation? What should I do (a general pathway) to achieve my goals in your opinion?",5,0

However, I've heard a lot about self-taught developers not having good fundamentals in CS, etc. With that said, I've been considering taking CS50 online and then looking into some object oriented programming courses prior to beginning to learn a specific language (in my case, Python would be my first language). Do you think this is a good idea? This is what I've been thinking but I'm not sure if it's an optimal route to take.

1. Take CS50 online
2. Take an object oriented programming MOOC
3. Begin w/ this:  [https://realpython.com/start-here/](https://realpython.com/start-here/) 
4. Continue to make projects w/ Python
5. Eventually hop into other languages for software (still not sure which).

I kind of don't wanna go the web-dev route and so I decided not to pursue an invaluable resource like the Odin Project.

I'd love to be a high school math teacher where I could earn 2900 gross per month but I know IT jobs are paid well beyond that.  
My goal would be able to buy myself a really nice house somewhere not so far from the capital city (I live in Belgium, I speak French English and Dutch, French being my mothertongue) and I know that with a teacher's salary I won't be able to get a loan for more than a 200.000 house alone.

I kinda rather do a master in Computer Science (instead of the high demand high paying Cybersecurity) because i've never been really interested in being a ""Hackerman"" and I know that doing that you can end up being an IT consultant but I have no idea what does an IT consultant do at his work. I also heard you can start your own company but I don't know how that would work since I have no idea what I could be ""selling""

Apologies if this has been asked a bunch before, but I'm hoping to get some advice.

I am currently exploring options for expanding my education in CS and am debating what would be best for my background and career goals.

A quick bit about my background:

* I majored in finance + accounting during undergrad (graduated almost 8 years ago)
* At first job, I ended up doing some data analytics and taught myself SQL and C# before switching to a software company as a data engineer. 
* I am still at the software company where I have gained an expert understanding of SQL and had small opportunities to use C# to build basic internal desktop applications
* I'm now leading an engineering team that features a mix of software engineers, data engineers, product managers, and quality assurance engineers

My career goal is to continue to focus on leading software engineers (managerial track), whether individual teams or a full product area. My concern is that I have no background whatsoever in CS. While I don't think that will hold me back at my current job and I currently have no intention of leaving, I also want to prepare for the future and make sure I never feel ""trapped"" at my company because I wouldn't be qualified at other companies due to my lack of CS experience.

I've been reading up on MOOCs, graduate certificates, and potential CS Masters that don't require an undergrad CS degree. My company does offer reimbursements on tuition if I pursue any of these so the cost is less of a factor.

* Which of these, if any, are worth pursuing?
* Will the combination of one of these + my work experience be enough on my resume should I ever need to leave my current company?
* Are there any specific programs you would recommend I look into?

Question: Now I'm learning there are all sorts or development fields, front end, web dev, back end, hardware/software interface etc. Now that I have some choices, what should I focus on? Is it a little of all of them, some more than others, or what? Or is it just opinion? Do you prefer development or engineering? Which is more valuable?
Note: Keep in mind that I'm great at math, and have so far taken up to calc 2 and discrete probabilities, and will probably keep going and finish with a math minor, so that isnt a limiting factor for me. Also I'm not interested in doing research. I'd rather join the work force.

I have a Lenovo Z50 on which I have two Operating systems Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16. The problem, which I believe everyone has, is when you shutdown Windows and after that you boot on Ubuntu you will not be able to write on the other disks, if you search for this you find that windows has an option of "" fast reboot"" and it is activated by default this option allows windows 10 to reboot faster and causes the stated problem. If you deactivate this option or if you shutdown using a full shutdown using cmd ( shutdown /f) you will not have the problem and another way is simply to restart from Windows ( restart it normally) then select Ubuntu, you will be able to write in the other disks.

So I decided to start looking for oportunities to start my professional carreer.

Although I ideally prefer cybersecurity to do as a full time thing, or something Back-end related, recently I was given an oportunity to start in a company in their Big Data sector.

Since I've got little to none experience in Big Data, I'm a little scared about that, because I don't know if I'm gonna like it or not, if I'm gonna be any good or not, and my major was focused mainly in Cybersecurity.
They are interested because they need juniors in that particular sector, and they offer some education + training in Big Data, so the lack of experience wouldnt be any that bad.

My question here is: since I'm still finishing my university course, would it be a good idea to start gaining experience in a area which i'm not particullarly experienced at (and even my thesis is not even closelly related to it), just as a way to start my professional carreer?",2,2

Your program should store the correct answers shown above in an array. It should ask the user to enter the students answers for each of the 20 questions, and the answers should be stored in another array. After the students answers have been entered, the program should display a message indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam. (A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions to pass the exam.) It should then display the total number of correctly answered questions, the total number of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question numbers of the incorrectly answered questions.

Hi,

For  my computer hardware class we do exercises on the Silicon Labs C8051F120  Development kit. I was looking to buy one myself so I could practice at  home, but unfortunately, the development kits for this series are not being sold/produced any longer. Is there another development kit for a  different C8051F family which would be almost equivalent to the F12X  family? Or is there some way I could emulate the board?

Any help would be much appreciated.",0,0

Right now I'm between the Surface Book 2 (8th i7,8GB, 256GB SSD), or the Surface Pro 7 (10th gen i7,16 GB, 256 GB SSD).
I'm aware that I could get a laptop with the same (or better specs) if I choose another brand. But the the 2in1 functionality, plus the pen support and notetaking capability is a must have for me. And (I think) there's nothing line the surface line up right now in the market. With that said, which one would you recommend me (they are around the same price range). Take in consideration that I'll be starting a CS university program from 0 ( basic stuff for a while). I don't plan gaming on this device as own an xbox and I'm planning to buy a well equipped desktop later next year.
Should I go for the newer i7 and 16 GB RAM? (Being honest I lean towards the SP7 as I heard/read that the SB2 has many problems.",1,0

I saw an ad on offer-up labeled plainly as two 21 IMacs, Make An Offer so i offered the person $150 for both (dumb lowball) and he accepted. the person says one doesnt power on  and they dont know why, and the other works but it needs to have a profile removed from it 
one is cracked also, but thats not a huge deal, but it is the one that isnt working... Is this a good deal considering a 2015 IMac plus a non-working one?

We are a small business and want to make sure we are erasing HDD's /SSDs fully as we need to certify there is no way the data can be recovered.

Currently when erasing a hard drive I use a SyStor hardware erase tool that overwrites the data.

	Pass 1: Overwrite all addressable locations with binary zeroes.
	Pass 2: Overwrite all addressable locations with binary ones (the compliment of the above).
	Pass 3: Overwrite all addressable locations with a random bit pattern
	Verify the final overwrite pass.
This deletes and make everything unrecoverable.

The next normal step is to destroy the HDD. But I read about your Crypto Erase, Data Erasure, and Dban. Is this necessary to help protect the data? Or could I just use bitlocker and fully encrypt the drive then destroy?

Would using the Systor, then enrypt, then destroy help protect our data? What is the best program to use to finish that encryption step? Currently I only have Bitlocker. I should note we dont care how long the process really takes as long as its secure.

I have experience with all of these, and I would recommend atom, but use what you like, not what others like. 

DO: Format your code. Make it readable so you can understand it when looking back at it. Some IDEs can do this for you, but some cant. 

DO: Use functions. A way to write code once and use it multiple times, every time your program calls that function.

DO NOT: Please dont make your code messy. I regret every piece of messy code Ive ever made for this simple reason: I cant look back at it and retrace my steps. I cant look at it and know what it even does. And that just defeats the purpose, doesnt it? If the only way to find out what it does is to run it, youre doing something wrong. 

DO NOT: Name your functions function1, function2 and function3. Eventually youll have to look for the function that does X, and check every single function for if it does X. Its a terrible process. Name your functions by what they do. makeNewPizza, convertPizzaToHamburger and eatTheHamburger. Those are good function names.",4,1

What would you recommend for a research topic for a semester-long undergraduate CS course? Thanks for any advice!",2,1

But I am greatly concerned about my options about the future with my computer science degree and much more about my intellectual capacity. I am currently a senior at my university pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, but I am taking junior-level classes (graduating 2 years late). I feel like computer science isn't for me. I like and enjoy learning the material, but the problem for me is that every single little thing is a huge learning curve, I am constantly always doing homework/studying and always attending all of my professors' office hours since I can never for the life of me do any assignment on my own, and this greatly concerns me. What I more precisely mean is that I can never solve things on my own, and I don't really like the idea of building apps and websites for people's validation. (Save me the discussion about major decision, it's already too late for me to switch majors, the school wont let me.) 

I chose computer science because I was very introverted my freshman year and had no problem with never interacting with people. Well that all changed now, and I love associating myself with people in general and I feel that in computer science all I ever do is sit behind a computer all day and struggle for hours. (I don't mind it too much because I actually do enjoy the material and concepts, I dont hate it).

  
 I have zero outside experience since I never have time for myself due to my assignments and I refuse to deprive myself of sleep and putting my health at risk (did that for 3 years and was constantly depressed, now I have a strict routine for working out, eating healthy, and sleeping). The only good thing I've got going for me is a part time security analyst job that I just started working at. I am worried if I'll ever be able to get a decent job with little to no outside experience and a terrible GPA of 2.5. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried joining clubs (currently part of cybersecurity which seems to be my major interest at the moment) and doing  hackathons (when I realized I dont like software development), I do have a huge network seems I would like to consider myself pretty charismatic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've applied to at least 80+ internships from software dev and cybersecurity and only three interviews with no luck.

Assuredly similar in spec, this week's news round-up also talks about the Archer 2 Supercomputer, which is probably equivalent to a few hundred thousand Aldi gaming computers. The Archer 2 will leverage about 748,000 cores built atop the Epyc processor lineup from AMD. More mainstream desktop-oriented news includes Intel's i3 chips potentially becoming more similar to i7s going forward, and PCIe Gen6 looking toward 2021.

Threadripper Leaks

GN received independent confirmation of non-compatibility leaks regarding Threadripper 3, but has also received information on the pinout, socket, chipset, and TDP for Threadripper 3 parts, as reported to AMDs partners in design documents.

Information is detailed below:

The new socket is sTRX4
It is not backwards compatible with Threadripper 1000 and 2000 motherboards, and those parts are not forward compatible with the new sTRX4 motherboards
Socket is mechanically identical to SP3, but there are changes to the pins
Castle Peak on sTRX4 socket. CPUs will be 4-ch and DDR4, 64 Gen4 lanes
4094 pins LGA
TRX40 chipset for supporting IO. 500-series chipsets
Sharkstooth is the reference design board for HEDT Threadripper
Reference boards went out a few months ago
Tctl 95C will exhibit thermal throttling on the CPU
Up to 280W TDP and down to about 180-190W TDP. tCase is defined between 65 and 80 degrees Celsius for the TDP formula, depending on CPU group (A, B, C), with HSF theta_ca between .12 and.14. Were avoiding giving hard numbers as we arent sure what AMD plants to identify sources.
Separately, rumors online this week indicated a 3960X 24-core CPU.

Rumor: Intels i3 Chips Will Gain Hyperthreading
Intel has historically segmented its features based on price, and hyperthreading has been no exception. Just last year, Intel caught flack for removing hyperthreading from i7 SKUs like the i7-9700K. Now, as AMD continues to ratchet up the competitive pressure, rumors suggest that Intel will bring hyperthreading to its lower-end i3 SKUs, where it continues to be the most vulnerable to AMD.

As found by well-known hardware leaker TUM_APISAK on Twitter, theres a new submission in the SiSoft Sandra database that shows an i3-10100 with a 3.6 GHz base clock. Most interestingly, its a 4C/8T part. The i3-101000 is presumably part of Intels upcoming Comet Lake, based on 14nm +++ silicon. If this holds true, then Intel will be selling a Core i3 part with the same configuration that used to be limited to flagship i7 SKUs just a few short years ago.

Past rumors have also suggested that Comet Lake will equip i9 SKUs with up to 10 cores and 20 threads, as well as the possibility of new motherboards and chipsets.

Intels 10nm Desktop Plans Arent Dead
A rumor began to run rampant earlier this week, orginigating from German hardware outlet HardwareLUXX. The site had claimed to have reliable information from insider circles that Intel was going to kill its 10nm desktop plans, and opt to wait until 2022 for its 7nm CPUs. The rumor seemingly pegged lower than expected frequencies from the 10nm node that were ill-suited for desktop parts.

However, Intel has expectedly refuted the rumor, stating that We continue to make great progress on 10nm, and our current roadmap of 10nm products includes desktop.""

What seems to have given the rumor traction is how long Intel has taken to get 10nm to a point of volume shipping -- and its still only shipping mobile parts in the form of Ice Lake. Then there's the aforementioned Comet Lake, which is yet another iteration of 14nm and another derivative of Skylake. Theres also the rumored Rocket Lake, which is supposedly set to debut in 2021, based on yet more 14nm silicon. The defunct Cannon Lake doesnt paint a pretty picture for Intels 10nm desktop ambitions, either.  

Ultimately, Intel has been tightlipped about what form 10nm desktop parts will take, and when they might land. For now, well have to take Intel at its word and see what happens. The statement to Toms Hardware was decidedly ambiguous, and leaves a lot of weasel room for what happens. We dont know, for instance, if 10nm desktop support will include HEDT, mainstream, or NUC parts, or just one of them.

PCIe 6.0 Looks Good For 2021

We talked about a PCIe Gen5 demo last week, but that was a week ago, so no one cares about PCIe Gen5 anymore.

PCIe 6.0 was originally announced last June, just after the PCI-SIG group finalized the PCI 5.0 specification. However, at the time, the specification for PCIe 6.0 was little more than a draft. Now, its already seen significant progress, as the PCI-SIG has issued an update stating that PCIe 6.0 has officially entered version 0.3.

The technical details -- such as bandwidth, throughput, technology, etc.-- haven't changed since the original announcement. Rather, the announcement seems to serve as a mile marker for development, ensuring that the specification looks good for a 2021 finalization, as the PCI-SIG wants to avoid the long gestation period PCIe endured between 3.0 and 4.0.

We maintain a small online study group and were looking for a few new members to join and be productive with us. The core idea is to simulate the feeling of studying in a library at the comfort of your own home (or anywhere, really!). Basically:

1. Determine your goals for the day
2. Set up a broadcast (be it your desktop, a webcam, or a neat background)
3. If you want, invite others to on a sync'd study session (like a pomodoro!)
4. Tackle your tasks!

If you enjoy company while studying and some light social interaction during breaks, you're more than welcome to join us. We maintain a friendly environment and have people from all academic fields and backgrounds. It's basically like a 24/7 international library, but online!

I am now wanting to move on to the more physical side of computer sciences... I think?

Being that I am self-taught I am unsure of the terminology to phrase here. I know at a certain point I am going to be blurring the lines of Electrical Engineering, but what or where would you consider PLCs and Automation to be placed in Computer Sciences? Or the physical arrangement of the hardware, monitor, physical user interfaces, etc?

I am also intrigued by more theoretical concepts such as...  What is the difference between a Xbox and a Play Station  if you will... they are both designer computers  ...  what would you consider that area of study... computer theory?

This is my first year at college, first semester, I am studying CS, I'm really interested in everything  we take such as discrete and numbering systems etc.. but I don't know when I am going to start programming, I don't know how to start and I feel everyone with me know more about tech things  and they are so talented even if i am so interested on computer science and I wanna learn everything related to this field but I always feel that I am behind them.
I am so confused about the whole thing I don't know  when to start take courses and learn by myself or just wait and study the subjects that unversity afford at the beginning..i love computer science and I'm very excited when I read about how computers work, how we invented them etc and I can't imagine myself working in any other field ,but now after seeing other students who are at my age but better than me I feel I can't take a place on this filed and I will not prove myself, my ideas,moreover I don't have anything new to add to the field.

We maintain a small online study group and were looking for a few new members to join and be productive with us. The core idea is to simulate the feeling of studying in a library at the comfort of your own home (or anywhere, really!). Basically:

1. Determine your goals for the day
2. Set up a broadcast (be it your desktop, a webcam, or a neat background)
3. If you want, invite others to on a sync'd study session (like a pomodoro!)
4. Tackle your tasks!

If you enjoy company while studying and some light social interaction during breaks, you're more than welcome to join us. We maintain a friendly environment and have people from all academic fields and backgrounds. It's basically like a 24/7 international library, but online!

Unlike databases and other systems which simply store data, data warehousing takes an entirely different approach, it normally use a denormalized data structure, which uses fewer tables because it groups data and doesnt exclude data redundancies. Denormalization offers better performance when reading data for analytical purposes. On that note, data warehouses are used for business analysis, data and market analytics, and business reporting. Data warehouses typically store historical data by integrating copies of transaction data from disparate sources and can also use real-time data feeds for reports that use the most current, integrated information.

Coupled with solutions around data analytics and big data processing, data warehousing allow businesses gather, quantify, and actually analyze its information and take its information to an entirely new level by helping you create data visualization to make better decisions around your business and the market.",0,0

Id like to learn and be involved in research to grow as a programmer and learn how to be a part of a research team, but... I doubt that I would be of any kind of help up front (maybe providing continuity in future when I am actually able to be of minimal value since I am only a sophomore). Is this something even worth pursuing right now? 

I am working on a presentation that I need to present to the research group and just dont want to make a fool out of myself. But Im also older and realize that sometimes, rejection is just part of the game. I also would like to know if there will be ways that I can contribute just starting off even with the limited programming experience. My math experience is Diff Eq, LA, some statistics, and have physics knowledge up to introductory quantum mechanics. I dont think any of those things are really applicable, but I guess, how would I, (or even should I), try to convince this research group full of pHDs and graduates with limited space for undergraduates that I would be a good fit or accessory to this program?",2,2

Im now a junior at my state university and Ive recently made the switch into computer science. Coming from a B.A program, i am now taking the prerequisites for the College of Engineering: Physics, Calc, Intro to Python, etc., and Im loving every second of it and very glad to have made the switch. Especially taking Physics and Python.

Would a Computer Science major with a cognate (or minor) in Physics be as worthwhile as a Computer Engineering degree? 

Computer Engineerings blends the Electrical Engineering courses (circuits, processors,etc) and CSE courses.  It takes 128 credits to graduate.

Computer Science takes 120 credits to graduate.

We maintain a small online study group and were looking for a few new members to join and be productive with us. The core idea is to simulate the feeling of studying in a library at the comfort of your own home (or anywhere, really!). Basically:

1. Determine your goals for the day
2. Set up a broadcast (be it your desktop, a webcam, or a neat background)
3. If you want, invite others to on a sync'd study session (like a pomodoro!)
4. Tackle your tasks!

If you enjoy company while studying and some light social interaction during breaks, you're more than welcome to join us. We maintain a friendly environment and have people from all academic fields and backgrounds. It's basically like a 24/7 international library, but online!

Whoever has hacked my account is clearly (REGULARLY) using it too, because I can see my notifications frequently change through out the day! P.S. I use the Chrome browser on my phone to monitor my notification activities, after getting hacked. 

So basically, this is clearly someone I know, who knows my old number (haven't used it for a couple of years), idk how they got my password, because it's just a set of random letters and numbers, that only I knew. So this person is using my number, but has changed the password, and Fb recovery isn't being helpful at all. HOW CAN I RECIEVE A TEXT ON A NUMBER I NO LONGER USE, NOR DOES IT GIVE ME AN OPTION TO CHANGE IT TO MY CURRENT NUMBER 

I would really appreciate some help on this issue because I use this account for professional reasons and the keep in touch with friends that have moved away, and wouldn't want any sensitive information getting into the wrong hands.",3,0

Im am a 34M with a BS in Biology but my degree has turned out to be basically useless, so Im looking to start my career path all over again and need some advice.

I have always been interested in the digital world, but pushed back against computer science as a teenager. I grew up in the 90s/early 2000s so home computers and the internet were brand new to most everyone. I was always a smart kid too, so naturally I got overwhelmed with everyone wanting me to fix their computer when they would break it (mostly family and neighbors) and this caused me to actually lean away from computer science as a career because I could see the writing on the wall of being everyones personal tech support.

Well now I find myself at 34 years old, stuck in a dead end job that has nothing to do with my degree and I am ready to start over. I know there are a million sub fields of CS so I dont expect a magical answer or anything, I just want some general guidance if possible. 

I am the most interested in digital forensics and data recovery from damaged or deleted drives and systems. Other areas of CS are still interesting to me though. My main question is, am I going to be required to bite the bullet and go back to college to get another bachelors degree? Or will I be able to start my new career by studying for and obtaining some of the standard certifications related to this field such as the compTIA certs and others? I really dont want to go back to school full time at this point in my life, and from the knowledge Ive gathered so far, it seems this may be one field in which its not completely necessary. Am I wrong about this?

Thank you for your time and I appreciate any answers or guidance you may be able to deliver to me!",2,1

I'm trying to find cost efficient hardware (and get more info on it) to be able to distribute it to clients for a cheap price.

2. When it comes to personalization of the cards, what are some safety measures I should take when ordering the personalization? Working under a regulated market and have to make it secure, in case user card gets in the wrong hands.

3. I've read that most cards are personalized with Java. Is that true? If not, what would be the most efficient language in your opinion to code such system with?

-Make group chats or individual chats from friends list

-Sending real time text or images to chats

-Peer to peer network

I am looking for contributors for my project, [autostack](https://github.com/autostack-team/autostack). autostack is a command-line debugging tool that captures raised python exceptions, automatically searches stack overflow for an answer to the exception, and displays the answer in the console with syntax highlighting!

I actually entered this into a hackathon (CrimsonHacks 2019) and placed top 5. However, I am now looking to expand this to other languages besides python, add smarter Stack Overflow queries, and even create VS Code and Atom extensions.

Literally anyone interested in this project can start making changes and submitting pull requests. After a few contributions, if you'd like to become a collaborator, that's a possibility too! Not to mention that this project is definitely beginner friendly!

Checkout the repo at [https://github.com/autostack-team/autostack](https://github.com/autostack-team/autostack)! Looking forward to hearing from you guys!

Thanks,

While I won't go into the technical detail, I want the high-level descriptions of it to be fact-based. Hence this question.

All I know about games from my limited experience involves using commercial libraries, engines, and dev tools. LibGDX, Unity, Unreal, whatever. But a game wouldn't be very spooky if it had a corporations' labels all over its files and code.

Therefore, **assuming a brilliant, gifted developer had decades of their life to work on this game**, and only wanted to use a modern OS's drivers and C, what would they have to code from scratch that would normally be included in an external lib/engine? Sound? Graphics? What would the build process look like to get the game into an actual executable?

Bonus points if you have ideas to spook-ify the codebase more! I was thinking they could even use their own compiled/interpreted language, built on top of C or assembly or something like that.",6,3

The truth value table for XNOR gates says that it outputs if both the inputs are the same, so either AB or A'B'.

That seems to have the same truth value table as an OR gate receiving inputs (A'B') and (AB). This should be shown in the upper diagram here under F3. 

Since F3 seems to have the same truth value table in both diagrams, would the F3 functions be equivalent even if the bottom one doesn't receive any A'B' input?

After the user invokes the skill,  
Alexa will tell them what the last person said,  
then the user will be prompted for his message.   


He can say anything he wants, to the next person who invokes the skill.  
Hoping that it will be used for wholesome and positive messages to all.

I want to build a database for this state-funded college program that I work for part-time. Im still an undergrad CS major and Im taking a database class next semester.

We currently lack a database that is tailored to us to store student information and possibly run reports. Would it be feasible within the time span of a few months for me to build a database such as this on my own? Would I need others to help me? It would be used by multiple users with different levels of access and I want it to be able to produce reports and export them in excel format.

I would love to use this opportunity to learn, help the program, and have a project under my belt. I dont expect it to be quick and easy but I just wanted to know if Id be way out of my league attempting this.",7,0

Tried to do some natural language processing stuff, but 8 second Alexa timeout is not letting me do that(thinking of a workaround). So thought of just making a simple and (wholesome) skill.

What this skill does is simple:
After the user invokes the skill,
Alexa will tell them what the last person said,
then the user will be prompted for his message.

He can say anything he wants, to the next person who invokes the skill.
Hoping that it will be used for wholesome and positive messages to all.



Example :

User : Alexa, &lt;skill invocation name&gt;
Alexa : Hello, Welcome to &lt;skill&gt;. The last person said : ""I just bought a Nintendo Switch""...Now it's your turn to speak. Tell the world what you want to say.
User : Tell everyone, I had an amazing day and I hope you do too.
Alexa : I have told everyone what you had to say. Hope it was something nice.

(The next person who invokes the skill)

User : Alexa, &lt;skill invocation name&gt;
Alexa : Hello, Welcome to &lt;skill&gt;. The last person said : "" I had an amazing day and I hope you do too.""...Now it's your turn to speak. Tell the world what you want to say.

My research is in algorithms, and it is going great. In fact, in my opinion having a math background is ideal for theory research.

However, I have found that classes in my CS program have been quite a struggle; In particular CS theory courses including algorithms. While in the math programs I had straight As and was often the top of my class, I am frequently below average in my theory courses and recently even made the lowest score on an exam for an advanced algorithms course (there were only 10 people, but still) =\[  My old math program was considered more prestigious than my current CS department, so it isn't because I have moved to a more challenging program. I told one of my old math professors about this, and he said this was actually a common phenomena and he had heard of several other math students having difficulty with the ""math-y"" CS courses. So I was thinking that some possible explanations for this could be:

1. In math courses, the emphasis tends to be on depth of understanding and developing intuition for the material. In contrast, in my CS theory classes the emphasis seems to be on finding clever solutions and puzzle solving. Math students probably study in a way that develops the former since that is what was emphasized in math, but then don't do so well on a test that is designed to test for the latter.
2. CS theory courses go over way more material, and the student is expected to have a more broad but shallow understanding compared to a math course. Math students may have difficulty keeping up with the material if they were to learn it at the depth that would be expected in the math department.
3. Many of the CS theory courses I've taken either don't have a textbook or only go out of one loosely. This makes it way more difficult to learn the material, let alone find problems to practice. In contrast, pretty much all of my math classes went *exactly* out of a textbook and the exams were related to problems you had practiced.

Has anyone else gone from math to CS and experienced related struggles?",15,87
