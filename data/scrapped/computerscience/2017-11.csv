Should I stay with compsci?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7a088r/am_i_too_late_should_i_stay_with_compsci/,mattcompsci,1509496938,"I think computer science is one of those things that everyone and their brothers are flooding into. 



I'm almost done with general education courses at my local community college and I have a lot of coding experience outside of college.


Having said that I'll be in college for awhile atleast another year before I get my associates and then I'll transfer out where there's a possiblity that some credits won't transfer. Come graduation is it possible that salaries will go down and competition will rise significantly? I live just outside of Manhatten. 



I've thought about just stopping college all together and just grinding out the skills necessary to land an internship which will segway into a job. 



What do you guys think the best path is at the moment? Switch majors? Maybe I should switch to physics, math, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering.



Should I focus on Cyber security?

    const nightmareMatrix = new gaussianMatrix([[0, 0], [0, 0]], [0, 0]);

    if (nightmareMatrix.mat.every(row =&gt; row.every(col =&gt; col === 0)) &amp;&amp;

I know that the values to initialize the `gaussianMatrix` instance needs to be changed. So, I turned to some shell scripting:

    echo ""Enter the first equation of the system.""
    printf ""a? ""
    read eq1a
    printf ""b? ""
    read eq1b
    printf ""c? ""

    printf ""a? ""
    read eq2a
    printf ""b? ""
    read eq2b
    printf ""c? ""
    read eq2c

    echo

    magicregex=""^const nightmareMatrix""
    sed ""/${magicregex}/s/[0-9]\\+/${eq1a}/1;
    /${magicregex}/s/[0-9]\\+/${eq1b}/2;
    /${magicregex}/s/[0-9]\\+/${eq2a}/3;
    /${magicregex}/s/[0-9]\\+/${eq2b}/4;
    /${magicregex}/s/[0-9]\\+/${eq1c}/5;
    /${magicregex}/s/[0-9]\\+/${eq2c}/6"" main.js | node

So, using shell script:

- We inquire input from the user from the comfort of their terminals.
- We *literally just fucking* edit the JavaScript code in the correct place.
- We pipe the edited code to Node REPL to run.
- We get output.

Sorry about bragging, but this is literally me bragging. Anyway, I made this because I was pissed about how frequently these exercises come up in my schoolwork, and so I decided to just implement an algorithm and give it a nice interface.",0,0

I need a computer upgrade to keep up with my classes (MS Informatics - coming from a NON-CS background) and I know nothing about current hardware. 

I tried to explain what I was going to use it for and the guy at the computer store had no idea what I was talking about. He tried to explain the capacity of each processor/MB/Memory in terms of video games but I'm not a gamer. 

I don't do anything that's graphically intensive (some data visualization next semester but nothing like a video game) but I need to be able to run a lot of resource hogging programs at once. Many browser tabs with secure logins that are constantly making sure that I really really really am an authorized user, plus MySQL or RStudio or Python - sometimes more than one of those, and Office everything, etc.

So, my question to you all is what processor can I get away with? I mean, my computer now is ""Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz, 3000 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 2 Logical Processor(s)"" with 6G RAM. I obviously don't need the $1000+ gaming system (nor can I afford it).

I just managed to get this funny message about C++ and crashed everything running a SQL script, so it's obviously time to upgrade. 

I can assemble a computer, I have the software (legit Windows key and the others are included in my tuition) but I need to know the least expensive processor that I can reasonably use for this. As for the MB, I need to have an ethernet connection (yay Federal gov't), and I'd like to use two VGA monitors (the nice man who didn't know what he was talking about sold me a GeForce 8400 GS, which is fine for me but I have to have a MB that it will fit and IDK my ass from my elbow in that department) - pretty much everything else can be done with software and additional HDDs. 

Am I making any sense? I checked the specs of the computers in our labs and they are way out of my reach financially. 

Any and all direction is appreciated. 

Yes, this is my first semester and I (loooong story) had a much better computer that I used for SPSS in my last degree. Knowing that SPSS and it's horrible resource hogging is potentially on the horizon (plus Python, yay) I'm worried. 

I'm praying that Black Friday will bring me a good discount and that you all (Gods and Goddesses of Hardware) will tell me what I need to buy. 

Thank you!

When I started college as a freshman, I tried programming but I wasn't ready for real work. I was a partier and instead of focusing on my grades, I focused on socializing and just decided that I didn't have the work ethic to succeed in programming.

I chose business management as my major 2 years ago because I didn't know what I wanted to do and just assumed that I would never be smart enough for programming.

Since then, I have given up the partying and take school seriously. 

I don't have a passion for management, nothing about it really excites me.

The thought of being apart of the development process for a video game excites me. 

I am only 3 more classes away from finishing my BA in management so I plan on definitely finishing that.

However, I was thinking of filling my 2 open electives next semester with CS courses to help make sure that this is something I want to do.

My business advisor suggested that I have 2 options.

Option 1 : get dual degree of management and computer science

Option 2 : get masters in computer science

So what was confusing to me was how I would be accepted into a computer science master's program if I have very little experience with programming at all?

I'd imagine that some decent background, and in most cases, at least 2 years worth of computer science credits would be necessary to get into a masters in computer science program?

If I choose option 1, I'll still plan on getting a masters in computer science. 

Either way, I really feel that something involving computer science is what I want to do. 

Any advice would be welcoming, but please don't try to dissuade me from going down this route. I have the financial means and the time to do this. 

I want to do something I will enjoy doing for the rest of my life and I always thought computer science was just that.

I have a few questions to ask though.

1.) what must i do to ensure i can do well in this career?
2.) will the limit of my skill in math be a struggle?
3.) is computer science a rigorous major?
4.) Is there any resources to support me?
5.) is computer science a hit or miss career or it just takes time to perform better overtime?",1,9

I am looking for advice, experiences, and stories from redditors in the CS field.  I graduated from school with a degree in biology (minor in CS) and went to a year of dental school before figuring out I didn't have the chops to be successful in the field of dentistry.  After racking up an unbearable amount of student debt, and with nothing to show for it but a BS in biology, I returned to undergraduate school to complete a CS degree and hold off student loan payments.

Since returning to school, I have fallen in love with CS and programming.  Classes are fascinating, lots of fun, and I am succeeding again.  However, I currently work 32 hours a week as a pharmacy technician (just to pay bills and have a rainy day fund) while going to school.  At this rate, it will take no fewer than 2, possibly up to 4.5 years to graduate.

I have been reading lots of articles and listening to lots of podcasts, as well as chatting with the two people I know who got CS jobs from undergrad, and I'm wondering what my best route is.  I like school, but I want to start chipping away at this debt as soon as possible.  I feel bummed out that my job and assignments leave me with very short time in the week to make time for additional projects and studying that I want to be doing.  I have heard lots of stories of people from non-CS backgrounds landing jobs in tech, and learning as they go.  I wonder how ""out of the norm"" these situations are, and if it's something I would be able to do.  Should I stay in school and continue working for as long as it takes?  Or should I be looking for something with my less-than-average programming skills?

Please offer any advice you may have, I am interested to hear your opinions.  And if you know of a different subreddit that I could also post this too, I'd appreciate that too.  Thank you, Reddit!",1,1

I have a question I'd like to ask that regards learning code in college. So, I'm quickly reaching the point in college where I need to decide on my major and I have no clue on what I should do. And for certain medical reasons I've had to take a gap year and it really fucked up the way I can take math (specifically the prerequisite courses for CS like Precalc/Calc).

I made a different post going into more specific detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7b096h/help_in_deciding_a_major_how_important_is_this/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) because I didn't know what to major in and the one person to respond recommended that I still do the math (which I hate) despite the extra time it would take and go for computer science. And so I'm here. 

So to the main point, I've got a few questions for the ones who've ""been there done that"" essentially. I ask in the title how important something like a degree would be in computer science because I've always thought that experience is better than the degree alone (of course both would be best, but I'm looking at it as a comparison here). And so I've thought maybe I could major in something more general and just get the degree because I feel that most jobs really only look at the fact that you have one and any experience, especially considering how many graduates usually end up with a career that has nothing to do with the field that they studied in.

I had some level of intent to try coding on my own and see where I go from there, but would just majoring in the field be better as a whole? I don't want to take the math (to be clear I've been relatively good at math, it's just repetitive and stressful to me, more so than other things), and I don't know how much I'd enjoy code (enjoyment is crucial in my opinion), but the last thing I want to do is regretting decisions I made in college.

Would graduating in CS widely open up my job prospects as opposed to things like philosophy or something?

I'm graduating with my B.S. this semester and my parents, my girlfriend, her parents, and a number of other family members have been asking me and I have no idea what to tell them. They all know I'm fairly difficult to purchase for, (I'm somewhat meticulous when reviewing different things to solve a problem.), and they don't want to surprise me with something that I don't really want, so for the most part they want me to tell them. 

I'm both low maintenance and have been lucky to have a full ride scholarship, plus a decent job through school, so I'm not really lacking for anything obvious. I've even dug into my ""long term"" Amazon wishlist, but they don't really even understand what most of the things on there are, (1080 Ti for example, the others on this list follow a similar pattern.), never mind the prohibitive cost. I do have a wishlist for books, mostly CS related, but when pointed there, some have shied away citing the fact that a book is actually what they normally get me for one of the holidays. Some have even gone so far as to say they'll get a book, but want to do something else as well and won't take no for an answer.

At this point, it's less about me, which is fine, and more about helping my family feel like they picked out a good gift. I'd just like to be able to point to something that they can see me use and be proud they gave it to me. Does anyone have any CS related ideas?

I have two vectors of which I need to compare the cross product. The specific code section is [here](https://github.com/fschutt/clipper-rs/blob/3e6f190fc97beb38619578c49d65c529fe376dd4/src/lib.rs#L329-L337).

    let d = vec_a * vec_b - vec_c * vec_d;

The size of the ip_x and the other points is either *isize* (pointer size, varying between 32 and 64 bit) or *i64* (signed long / 64-bit). The problem is that the multiplication could overflow leading to possibly garbage results. The thing is, I am not interested in the result, only if it not equal to 0 and if it is greater than 0. 

The [original code](https://github.com/fschutt/clipper-rs/blob/3e6f190fc97beb38619578c49d65c529fe376dd4/src/cpp/clipper.cpp#L462-L463) uses a trick: it casts to a double. Since multiplying floats simply adds their exponents, this does not overflow, however, the lost accuracy also makes for a garbage result.

So a solution would be to use an i128 type, however this is fairly slow. I wanted to ask if it is possible to compare the multiplication, without actually multiplying. This would need a certain way of bit-shifting, however, I am not sure if there isn't a way to avoid this if I don't need the result.

So far I can say that if I shift right by 31 bits, I can at least be sure that it doesn't overflow (most numbers will be in this range).

    let vec_a = ip_x - pt_x;
    let vec_b = np_y - pt_y;
    let vec_c = np_x - pt_x;
    let vec_d = ip_y - pt_y;

    if (vec_a &gt;&gt; 31) &gt; 0 || 
       (vec_b &gt;&gt; 31) &gt; 0 || 
       (vec_c &gt;&gt; 31) &gt; 0 || 
       (vec_d &gt;&gt; 31) &gt; 0 {
        // possible overflow here (for i64 types)
    } else {
        // will not overflow
        let d = vec_a * vec_b - vec_c * vec_d;
        if d != 0 {
            return -1;
        } else if (d &gt; 0) == (np_y &gt; ip_y) {
            result = 1 - result;
        }
    }

However, I don't know if it is possible to compare the multiplication of two integers without actually doing a full i128 multiplication.",0,2

I have an assignment for an introduction to education class I am taking. I need to interview an educator. However, since I have little interest in becoming an educator myself, I have decided to interview those in the field I am really interested in, Computer Science! Any educator may feel free to answer these questions and even add any additional input you may feel a need to express. To clarify what an educator is, an educator can be a work trainer or technical teacher (k-12), or a formal educator above 12th grade. 

Here are some questions to get the ball rolling.



1. How important is a formal education when trying to land a good programming job?

2. There are many programming languages, which ones do you teach in, and why?

3. Is it important to learn as many  programming languages as possible or stick with a few and focus on mastering them?

4. What is the most enjoyable thing about teaching computer science?

5. Are there people who just flat out do not understand programming, or is it a subject anyone can master with enough practice?

6. How do you go about explaining hard to understand or extremely abstract concepts to junior students?

Also, I know that a lot of questions I am asking could potentially be answered in the side bar, but the point of this is to get the perspective of an educator specifically and to open up a discussion with more questions later on.

I'm trying to find out the differences between different terminologies and processes for storing memory within a CPU as it executes instructions. It seems the differences between the above terms are not well understood and I've seen a lot of misleading and outright incorrect information and would like to get some clarification.

I currently believe that:

Cache: Stores commonly used commands so they can be reused more quickly than rereading them from RAM. Not sure if this is the same as the Immediate Access Store or a separate mechanism.

Immediate Access Store (IAS): Used be CPU to store data awaiting processing so it is instantly accessible

Registers: Holds data that is actually being processed

Accumulator: Part of register used for arithmetic or logic data

Anyone know?

But, school is also extremely expensive, lol, and there seems to be a ton of source material you can find online that can essentially teach you what a degree could.

* A degree also seems to have a ton of core degree requirements like physics and calculus that would eat into how long the program will last - im sure they are important to framing your mind on the subject matter. 

If anyone has decided on second degree in this field, how is it-was it worth it?

* Does the ranking of the school matter significantly? - Considering two schools, one is ranked higher, but tuition is like twice as expensive.

138,2017-11-13,2017,11,13,4,7chkzo,Is it worth transferring to a different university if I'm not happy where I'm currently at?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7chkzo/is_it_worth_transferring_to_a_different/,Peach_Panther,1510515855,"Basically I'm living off a military benefit that pays strictly for 4 years of schooling (along with part time work). I live by myself so it's crucial for me to graduate in 4 years or less.

 The issue I have is that I enrolled in a state university's branch campus because the main campus was taking longer to accept my admission, and eventually did (after I said fuck it I'll just go to the branch campus and transfer, no worries). The school had rolling admissions and I applied late, so this is entirely my fault.

Well after finishing my military service and moving a whole bunch, I'm starting to realize that the school I'm going to is mostly liberal arts and business oriented, and that the computer science department is lacking. Contrary to what I believed when applying, transferring credits is a lot harder than I expected even though the universitys name is the same since the academic policies are different. 


I made a rushed decision to attend school here (applied to and researched schools while I was stationed overseas), and honestly I think I'd be quite happier at a bigger university with a vibrant cs community. The city of my school is extremely segregated by culture and is also a commuter school, while I live right next to the school. I'm surrounded by the ghetto (not to sound derogatory),homeless people, and 0 students. 

After some research of my own I concluded that it won't matter a whole lot where I get my degree from, it's the effort outside of class that matters. I feel like if I went to a larger, traditional college campus I'll be more involved outside of class, because in all honestly there is absolutely nothing here for my major. There is a small math/cs club of like 10 people that meet once a week. 



The only thing holding me back from transferring to my school's main campus is the fact that not all my credits will transfer, and that it will take me longer to graduate. I'm 22 years old starting my undergrad and my number one priority is graduating in 4 years, half of the reason being my limited funding and the other being that most people my age are already starting their careers. 

I know cs, like all STEM majors require classes to be taken sequentially, so transferring means that there is a good chance that Ill run out of my paid tuition/benefits and graduate longer than expected. 


Im not happy here, but Im happy Im starting school this fall as I planned and so far this semester is going well. 

TL;DR - Applied to colleges while stationed overseas. Got out of military, decided on branch campus of state university, moves back to america, moves across america to start school, area and school sucks, wants to transfer to main campus but found out transfer process is difficult. ",15,9

My NG Grant will not work here(save this for my masters?). I don't know how employment goes after graduating...

* **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign:** **PROS:** This is a phenomenal engineering school. It ranks high and after visiting the campus it seems like the engineering department gets a ton of funding.

I'm worried I will miss the social aspect of the school here and it's in a rough rough neighborhood. the school is also very expensive and even with scholarships, I will probably have debt.

Is this a field that you would most likely have to move to work in? I live in St Louis and while I have the option to move at the time I'm done with school I may not want to. Would it be hard to find work if I don't want to move? 

Is this something that is going to require a bachelor's degree for most jobs? I'm going to start the first two years at community college (I'm broke) and I want to know how nessicary it would be to go to university. 

What kind of laptop would last me through school? As I said, I'm fairly broke but I want something that would last me through school. I've been recommended thinkpads, since it's really going to be used soley for school but I wanted to see if anyone else had affordable and reliable options.

What kind of work load should I expect? I'm going to try to work part time 24 hours a week. If I need to I can work 12 or 14 hour shifts on the weekends, but I'm not sure if this would leave enough time for school work and studying.

I may add on to this later if you guys don't mind me asking a million questions! 

Edit: I did think of one more thing though this may be kind of silly. I know that this is a relatively male dominated field, is it likely to cause problems or set backs going in as a female? I don't see myself as any less capable as anyone else, but I don't know the additude that this field has towards women.

I graduated from one of the top universities in the U.S with a BS in Computer Science. I should be proud right? Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. I suck at programming.

I started my freshman year undeclared about 5 years ago. It wasn't until two years later that I accumulated so many credits that I had to finally choose a major. Honestly, I never knew what I wanted to do with my life. I still don't. Computer Science was just a shot in the dark. I literally picked out a random major out of a list and stuck with it. 

That's where all the problems start I guess. Despite being accepted into a great university, having high scores on all my entrance exams, and even managing to get a sizable scholarship, I could not keep up with any of these classes.

In short. I sucked at what I chose to do. Sucked is probably and understatement though. To be honest I am probably the worst programmer on the face of the earth. I know 3rd graders with more programming skills than me. I was almost always at the bottom of my class. I went from a 3.6 to a 2.5 in a short period of time. I barely made C's in my classes but somehow I managed to meet all the requirements to get my degree. I guess that leads me back to my original thought. I should be proud right?

I might actually have been proud if it all stopped there. I was just getting started. Now I have to find a job, which I don't mind. But to be honest, I don't know where to start. My resume, for obvious reasons, is lacking. I feel like I haven't learned enough to ace a basic interview. My actual coding skills are piss poor. I would say the only part I am actually decent in is the theory aspects behind programming but I'm sure most jobs aren't interested in theory. So that lead me to wonder, what should I do? What can I do? Is there anyone out there that can relate? Is there anyone out there that went through the same and ended up ok? I guess all I really need now is some advice.

Even if I don't come off badly, there's a competition part to the project so I don't exactly want to give out my secrets until the end. I'll talk about it here and possibly sound like a douche to people I don't know, but I need to vent my story so why not.

The project was basically to speed up linear algebra code in C++ and you get an A if you get a 20x speedup.

At first, I thought it was super easy, and it was super easy at the beginning. I profiled the tests and found that basically 99% of the time is spent on matrix multiply, which is relatively obvious because it is O(n^3 ) and everything else is O(n^2 ). To start, I transposed the second matrix being multiplied to optimize caching, stuck an openmp parallel for pragma at the beginning, and used a few AVX intrinsics to get ~8x flops. I got like 140x speedup, way above 20, and it took under an hour.

Done right? Turns out no, I failed random parts of the test because of floating point precision errors. The problem is that by multiplying large floating point numbers, you get some error, which is fine, but then if you subtract another large number of similar size, the proportional error is magnified. This happened a lot because the numbers used for testing were large random numbers with mean 0. The result ended up looking like every number was a few hundred off from the naive version, regardless of how big the number actually was.

So, I have a 140x speedup, I can easily just use doubles everywhere and incur an ~2x speed penalty but have negligible/no rounding errors. I did that and got a ~70x speedup but I was *still* failing tests by a few hundred or so. Why? Because the reference test values were off, not mine.

I had to come up with a way to speed up matrix multiplication but still keep every dot product addition in the same order it was before and revert back to floats instead of doubles. At first, I resigned to just not using SIMD instructions, but SIMD is the best so I had to figure out another way! Also, the competition was still a thing and didn't want to hand over a solution that's just barely better than 20x. What I came up with was a unique solution (at least I haven't seen it done anywhere else) where each lane of the SIMD registers corresponds to a position in the destination matrix and the full SIMD register corresponds to part of a row. That solution probably seems pretty obvious (it does in retrospect at least), but I think it's the first time in my (relatively short) CS career where I was actually stumped for a long time, then resorted to drawing out diagrams and doing math by hand to figure out the most optimal way to compute stuff while adhering to strict rules. In addition, I think it was the first time I had to basically tie all (well, a lot at least) of my CS knowledge together (complexity/algorithms, floating point representation, caching, pipelines, etc) to accomplish some goal.

After optimizing the code a bit more (unrolling SIMD instructions, reducing complexity in other places), I ended up with a ~70x speedup, which I'm pretty proud of despite having found a different solution that computes it twice as fast.

I'm not sure where I was going with this, but if you have any similar stories, I'd love to read them!",5,5

The interview needs to be ~20 minutes  including the introduction and closure  and it should be done via Skype. If anyone is interested in helping me out, I'd highly appreciate it. I have to record the interview but the video will only be shown to my professor.

If you can, please let me know and if you need more information, you can DM me here on reddit.

Thanks,

For instance: if I were to take an online course in database admin with oracle, would this be a transferable skills to other databases that aren't oracle?

(first generation immigrant family so i didn't have all the pieces to make a career decision BEFORE going to college)

I have a bachelor's in marketing. Not to knock on marketing, because i love and appreciate business, especially marketing. But I know marketing isn't the end of the road for me, because i love the challenge and reward of programming, and I want to pursue something in the CS field (maybe data science, machine learning, info security, or computer graphics).

After getting a marketing degree, i realized that what i'm really into is working with code and computers. So i enrolled and completed a coding bootcamp. I learned web development and how to program practically. (FYI the bootcamp was one of the greatest decisions in my life, it turned my life around and gave me a lot of programming knowledge. I would recommend a GOOD bootcamp to anybody).

Currently, I am working at an internship. But again, deep down i feel like i need to pursue something more in CS. I feel like I'm missing something

I've been thinking about going back to school for a post-bacc (a second bachelor's) in CS. This is because:

- I know some programming, going back for the actual theory, calculations and practice will be more fruitful with the experience i gained at the bootcamp and at my current internship

- More (relative) job security, because the industry is a little shaky right now regarding bootcampers, and because I fear not having a degree would cap my career at some point, and not enable me to expand and mature my interests in CS (not sure if i want to be doing web development forever!)

- Employers can't use the lack of degree to pay me less for the same work

- I want to get the CS foundation not offered at a bootcamp

- I may want to pursue a master's afterwards

- I want to be an overall better prepared developer

-----
Currently, I feel like I'm at a fork in the road. My options are:

- Keep working for a couple of years, and save up to go back to school for CS. Con -- graduate a little later in life, and possibly lose opportunities to younger competition, lose time i could be working and getting some experience, gain debt. 

- Go back to school next year for foundational knowledge and get the degree sooner, and give up the opportunity to learn more at my current internship. Con -- back in debt, back to school for a few years and not making money/strides in my career, losing the chance to dive deeper at my current job. (it's a startup so lots to do and lots to learn)

- keep working and not go back to school at all, not get any debt but risk losing potentially higher positions later, always feeling like i have gaps in my knowledge, always the question of why I didn't go for it

- go for a master's degree in CS. con -- feel like i'm missing out on the foundation, and some things (maybe alot of things) might go over my head


Does age really matter in the industry when trying to get a good job? Is it vital that I get the degree as fast as possible? I've been researching this for a while and the answers range all over the spectrum, now i'm hoping to ask you guys and girls with experience directly. Please help!

Thanks in advanced! :)

This year the units taught python in two units, which include general coding and to a certain extent some content on algorithms and data structures, discrete and continuous maths, and some really bad units that just barely touched the topics of web developement and computer systems (networks, cryptography etc.).

The point is, they're just trying to teach us some things (and then test us on a small part of those things) and hope that we all graduate with good grades which I personally feel is incompetent (but whatever). I went searching about the different subfields of CS and found that there are many things that I should learn, which I'm planning to do in my ongoing break. However, I am confused with how I should learn and progress, for instance, should I learn networking or databases first? It feels like having a really good book but without the table of contents - I don't know how to move on. I'd appreciate if someone could leave some guidelines, like when I should learn a particular part and why I should learn it, and what would I be able to achieve from learning it.

I'm a CompSci major (still learning C++), and, while reading the book, something that's come up to me over and over again is this constant implication that a good program must also be efficient, in that it must consume resources (RAM, CPU power, etc.) in as clever a way as possible. This has never been said explicitly or expanded upon, but that's the impression I got reading Starting C++.

My question is, What websites (or books) can I read to help me get more familiar with the idea of coding for resources-effective programs?

I narrowed down to these 2 schools. 
UF has very low cost for online program 130/per credit and the curriculum look very solid. It may take me 4 or 5 years to complete the degree because i can only take 2 classes per semester due to working full time and duty. 
ASU is ABET Accredited and their curriculum look very comparable to UF ( same as  UF for the first 2 year, require calculus 1,2,3 , linear algebra, physic 1,2. engineering statistic, ect..) . What I like about ASU is they offer 7.5 weeks of class. Although they are way more expensive but I may receive ""Military Active Duty and Reservist Commitment Scholarship"" which covers the rest of the tuition fee. I may graduation faster before i separate if i keep taking class whenever it is available. Am I Correct ? Or it will spread out to 4 years ?


Have anyone experienced with these school ? Which one will you recommend for active duty military with a busy schedule ( with base duty, cell phone duty, ect..)? 
Or should I pay out of pocket to enroll in OSU online program to do 2 year track ? 

I have a BS degree in Business and i Know I won't have a lot of credits transfer to my new school. I guess some English and low level Elective classes. ",2,4

I got accepted to the majority of my schools I applied to, but I am still waiting to hear back on a few. Here are SOME of the schools I got accepted to (ones I'm actually considering) and the scholarship(if any) that they are offering me.  

DePaul - $52,000
Loyola - none
UIC - haven't heard back yet  

Those were my top 3, here are some others that I don't really like the campus of or that I don't want to go to the school.  

Bradley - $40,000
Illinois Institute of Technology - $60,000

Which school has the best CS program? IIT I'm sure has one of the better ones but the campus is not the best in my opinion. I'm really considering DePaul, Loyola, and UIC.",5,3

I've never taken a class on computer science and I don't really know what it is either, but I registered for ""Computer Science I"" for spring semester because I'm curious. I know, it seems like a pretty stupid decision, but I'm currently undeclared and I'm just trying to explore my options as a college freshman! In any case, I heard from upperclassmen that computer science is really hard and wanted to know if anyone had advice on how to make it easier? Is there something I should read up on to make it easier to take in the course material? Should I learn how to code before the class to get a head start? Or is there a distinguishing characteristic among people who are good at CS? Regardless, any advice (even if it's that there's no shortcut to getting a good grade) helps!

tldr; I want a good freshmen year GPA and I also want to take an intro CS class, so how do I thrive without any background knowledge on it?

Also, just as a reference, I took AP Calculus AB in high school and that's the extent of my math knowledge. It's not much, but hopefully enough for this class?

Thank you!",9,4
