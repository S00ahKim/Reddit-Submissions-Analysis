I know a guy who knows a guy that is looking for a software engineer, and the guy that I know suggested me to the guy that he knows (sorry if confusing).

Anyway, we were introduced, and then the employer and I started emailing back and forth, and we planned to have a call on Tuesday (which is tomorrow). In the last email that I sent to him, I confirmed that Tuesday morning would be fine but asked him what time would be best for him/her. After that they didn't respond. My question is, would it be rude or out of place to email them again asking for a time or confirmation. If not, how would you word it?

Thanks!",0,1
