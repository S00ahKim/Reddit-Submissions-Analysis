The options: Business Information Systems, Computational Science, Computer Networks, Computer Security, Database and Informatics, Foundations, and Software Development

&amp;nbsp;

Does anybody have any recommendations of projects that I can do or places that I can reach out to get an idea of work spaces I could potentially get into? 



**Proficient Languages:** 

Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

**Other skills:**

Graphic Design, Finance, and I can definitely tell I work well as a team leader in all of my classes dealing with groups.

&amp;nbsp;

**My own ideas:**

I'm considering Web Design, even though that's not where the money is. I enjoy object-oriented programming and understand complex design patterns well. I could get into IT and do contract-based labor so that I could travel the world with a very in-demand skillset. Maybe I could work with algorithmic design and investment banking (a side hobby/passion of mine) by trying my hand at algo trading (aka work very hard for a few years of my life and not very much for the rest of my life because I have an application that makes +8% return on the stock market on a yearly basis).

&amp;nbsp;

I won't lie, my initial excitement with CS ended as soon as I exited the introductory programming courses and got into upper-level concepts. At the same time, I've only ever been in courses that surround me with software engineering, and -thanks to my distaste- I'm thinking maybe that's not for me? Simultaneously, data structures, design patterns, OOP, sorting algorithms, and search algorithms all make a lot of sense to me, but I get shit on in courses dealing with those concepts because we discuss proofs and dynamic programming, or I'm expected to come up with an algorithm to solve a problem during a test, when (in reality) it would take me a lot of time and researching. So, idk - prop me up or sit me down with that. 

I'm not really sure about any of my thoughts, so I thought I'd pose the question here where maybe there are others who were in my shoes and made poor or great choices.",13,12,False,self,,,,,

My current employer offers tuition reimbursement for my studies which I feel is an incredible opportunity.  My initial intentions were to get an IS degree to supplement my current experience (aka - just get it done).  I have started to feel that I wanted to obtain a degree in a major in which I felt I could personally be proud of.  Nothing against IS degrees in general, as I think they are still a great accomplishment, it is just that I feel that having a foundation in CS is going to be more personally beneficial.  I also didn't want to exclude myself from graduate degree programs which are engineering based.  Not to say at this time if I am going to go that route, but in a few years I certainly don't want to exclude myself from that possibility.  My current pay is in the low six figure mark, so I am currently not thinking a CS degree will automatically create a life changing income for me.  I do, however, think that it could open additional doors to opportunities... Maybe more money, maybe not... more interesting?   I hope so.  

After a decent amount of research, I was only able to find a handful of universities that would provide online coursework for a solid CS curriculum.  Currently I am slated to transfer to Regis University for their BSCS program here in a month or so.  There was also other schools which were contenders, but Regis seemed to be the best fit for the undergrad program which I could get into.  What is the perception of their CS program?  Will it have enough of a reputation to get into solid graduate program?

So, in my college we use [Sharif Online Judge](https://github.com/mjnaderi/Sharif-Judge) to grade our programming assignments. We use it because it allows the teacher to upload questions that he creates himself so that he can do specific exercises for each class. It also uses MOSS to detect cheats, so it's pretty much essential to our teachers.

However, it's missing quite a few key features that are really hindering our progress, like

* Not being able to give the gcc compiler compiling options (that means no C++14)
* Not being able to upload more than one file (so basically we need to implement something that we would normally do in a .h and a .c file in a single file)
* It's kinda hard to setup, because to configure each task you need to do a PHP script for it
* A few other things that escape my mind

Anyways, seeing that we depend on that tool to get ranked on our programming skills, I'd like to ask: is there anything better that we can use? Something that hopefully has the same features as that program, but with the key features that I listed and that are missing from that one.

Anyone else do something similar?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/48qfph/cs_intern_interview_embarrassed_i_bombed_this/,supercow_,1456980167,"This is somewhat of a vent post. Sorry. 


I had a CS intern interview today. Seemed to have good rapour with the interviewer. She liked my answers to the behavioral-type questions, problem-solving stuff, and general Java questions (what is overwriting a method, what are all the primitive types and their sizes, etc). Then there were a few technical questions. She asked me, what is wrong with this piece of code? (There was a little bit more interference code but this is the basic problem):

_________________________________________________
Instructions: The code should print 10, how can you fix it?

int total = 0;

for (int i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++)

total = total +i;

System.out.println(total)
_________________________________________________


I was running off 3-4 hours of sleep the last two nights and stressed because of a midterm later in the day so I wasn't in peak shape, but still, this is the type of thing I explain to students every day (I'm a CS tutor)! I figured I'd talk through the problem to explain how I usually work through these problems to show students what is happening. So I wrote down 'total = 0' and 'i = 1' to track the variables as I iterated through the loop, crossing off the numbers and updating them as I went. when i = 4 the loop fails its condition and stops. Total is 6. I got to that point and then just blanked. Do I add some extra variable to keep track of i outside of the loop? What is the trick to this problem? After maybe 20-30 seconds of mumbling over the problem again trying to figure it out she says ""I'll give you a hint its in the forloop"". I'm feeling kind of frozen for some reason. And she mentions that I've already counted up the numbers with 'i' and pointed to where I had written (i=1,2,3,4). And then I'm like ""oh...well I guess I could just iterate the loop once more by changing i &lt; 4 to i &lt; 5. She said ""yeah, I think you were overthinking that one"".


But I probably spent a few minutes on that question... and had a little guidance (even though I was eventually able to solve it on my own). I then went on to solve the other technical question that was a bitwise (a|b) question that was harder and more obscure before the interview concluded. 


I don't have a ton riding on this internship, but I've been kicking myself all day! I literally solve this type of problem (and ones much harder) all day. I just froze/blanked out. Do you think I still have any chance of making it to the next round of interviews even though I couldn't code my way out of a paper bag on this one question?

* Data Structures and Algorithms   (Textbook is the Cormen book)

* Comp.Sci 2- Basically just a bunch of Arduino work (which I've done but could definitely improve upon)

* Logic &amp; Discrete Mathematics 

And I'm taking a programming lab that had this as the topic areas: 

* C++ program basics-
Variables, types, control statements, development environments

* C++ functions-
Parameters, call stack, exceptions

* C++ memory-
Addressing, layout, management

* C++ classes-
Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance polymorphism

* C++ generics-
Overloading, templates, interface polymorphism , associated types

* C++ STL-
Iterators, algorithms, containers, functors


I'm currently doing the codecademy for Java just to get a feel for the language and plan on reading through Head First Java this summer while I'm working. 
For the Algorithms class I was going to try to pick up Introduction to Algorithms 3rd ed. by Cormen and look through the course notes.

I made a simulator/visualisation for data-flow analysis and need some feedback for a report I'm writing.

You can simulate some data-flow analyses on your programs (Reaching Definitions, Variable Liveness, Available Expressions) and see the output step-by-step via a visual graph or a table of results. There's also some mini-tutorials which aim to teach you about data-flow analysis if you've never seen it before.

All you need is a web browser with JavaScript enabled and an internet connection.

I've already done discrete math, calculus and linear algebra. In my last years I can choose one of two paths alongside my major:

1. applied physics, 
electronics, 
digital circuits.

2. multivariable calculus, 
complex analysis (cauchy theorem, taylor/laurent series), 
differential equation (first/second order linear equations, boundary value problems, phase plane analysis).

How do they attach to a JVM, find references to an Applet, and fake AWT events?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/4amouh/how_do_bots_for_runescape_and_similar_games_work/,Newell266,1458112072,"Runescape is a large online game with a pure-Java client which runs in the browser as a signed applet. It is pretty unique in that regard, with the other major example I know being Yohoho Puzzle Pirates. Due in part to the forces in the game economy, there is a large population of automated players running various bot software to grind for in-game resources.

These bots are some of the most complex Java applications I have seen, especially with regard to modifying the JVM state at runtime. I'm curious how these work, not necessarily specific to a particular game but more generally. (You can Google for examples pretty easily. I'm not going to direct link any because some of them are allegedly associated with malware.)

From what I can figure out, this is the approximate flow of what the bot does:

    Launches and attaches to the game applet. I'm not sure if this is a result of launching the applet in the bot's current JVM or a result of attaching to the game's JVM after it launches.
    Reads the game state. This at least means getting a reference to the current Applet and reading off of its Graphics. I'm not sure what else is involved here. I know some bots get references to some of the game's own objects and call their getters to read internal state programmatically.
    Fakes input. As far as the game can tell, it's receiving regular mouse and keyboard events. However, these are faked at the AWT level, since these bots can run fine when not in the foreground, and they do not use the system cursor.

How are each of these steps performed? What would I do if I wanted to write a similar bot for a similar game? Specifically:

    Should the bot launch the game, or attach to the game after it launches? Which of these approaches is feasible/reasonable? How are they done? In each case, how feasible/reasonable is it to get references to the game's Applet? What about JFrames or other AWT/Swing components it contains?
    Given a reference to the game's various AWT/Swing components, how does the bot go about reading them? When/where is it safe to do this?
    How does the bot call into the game code to call getters for client state? Note that the game code is obfuscated, and the names likely change with every build even if the overall topology of the code is almost the same. How does the author find these methods of interest to begin with?
    How does the bot send fake AWT input events? How does it do so in a reasonable and consistent manner?

I'm not necessarily looking to write such a bot, although this is one of the more interesting pieces of software I've seen lately, so I'm definitely looking to learn more about it. Interestingly enough, I think a lot of the stuff here could be applied to non-adversarial situations such as automated UI testing.

Full disclosure:

* I'm having trouble with some of the terms related to big O notation since I'm not very experienced with math, so, eg, telling me the run time of insertion sort grows quadratically means nothing to me

* this is an example question for school

I'm trying to understand how I would simplify down a mathematical function to its big O notation since it wasn't covered in class. I've read the notes on our slide decks (which are just reminders for talking points...), I've read a number of pages on Big O notation and such and I get the gist of what the various forms of O(n) or O(n log n) mean and how you might find those based on the process of an algorithm, I just don't really understand how I'd look at a mathematical function and say: THIS is the only thing I care about.

Anyway, the example function is **n^6 /1000 - 100n^4 - 100n^2 + 3**. 

I understand that 3 is not really important at all in cases where the input of *n* would be very large, hence you can ignore it, but I'm not quite sure what to do with the rest of the function. Going along the same lines, I assume we ignore n^6 /1000 since it will always be smaller than the two remaining portions of the function, and that we ignore 100n^2 for the same reason, thus leaving us with 100n^4 which is further simplified to n^4, thus, the notation is O(n^4). 

Does that sound right?",13,4,False,self,,,,,

For me it is clear how it applies to fields like agriculture, construction and manufacturing because they produce tangible products. So, it is easy to measure the positive and negative impacts of their practices on the natural environment and society.

But the concept is a bit abstract for professionals creating software. The product (software) is intangible. There is no direct impact on the natural environment due to the process of typing the code. It's like an author writing a novel. But except he writes it on his computer without using paper. 

So, how does software industries and professionals who strive sustainable development relate it to their fields. Do they consider the end result of the software. That is what it will be used for.

I understand WHY bootstrapping is important, I understand how it works (to an extent), but I don't understand how it works based on these diagrams. I think I'm completely misunderstanding the flow of the diagram.

[Example: (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bootstrapping-t-diagram.png)

I understand that each T represents a compiler, but I don't understand the statement on Wikipedia:

&gt; The righthand T is a C compiler written in machine code that produces (the same) machine code. The diagram illustrates that this can be used to bootstrap the left T by using it to compile the compiler written in C.

If the left compiler T, written in C is outputting M, and the right compiler written in M is also outputting M, how does it make sense that the C-based compiler is the input for the M-based compiler. I know I'm missing something here.
