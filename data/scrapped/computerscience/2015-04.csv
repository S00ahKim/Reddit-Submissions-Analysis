0,computerscience,t5_2qj8o,2015-4-1,2015,4,1,9,30zpao,self.computerscience,I've hit a wall and could really use some help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/30zpao/ive_hit_a_wall_and_could_really_use_some_help/,lolmycat,1427847128,"Before making you read a long wall of text, Ill start by explaining exactly what my post is about.

I am a 2nd year Computer Science major at a local community college in Southern California looking for some advice on landing an internship or part-time job.  I have applied to several companies, but have yet to get my foot in the door.  Ive searched high and low but seem to be unable to find many realistic job openings.  I have hit a wall, and honestly, it has begun to wear on me.  More than anything, I want to begin using my programming knowledge in a real-world environment, and get a taste of what it is like to work with a team of professionals.  I can only imagine how much it would allow me to grow as a programmer and individual. 


If any of you have gone through the same difficulties, or have any advice that could help, I would be incredibly thankful.
So now a little background on myself.  I am 21 years old, live in Orange County, CA, have been programming since my freshman year of high school, have been studying Computer Science for the past 2 years at a local community college, and will be transferring to a 4 year CS/UC school in the fall.   However, I have found little to no help at my community college with finding an internship.  I really enjoy programming and feel that it comes naturally to me.
  
I took my first CS class junior year of high school (AP Computer Science A), and received a 4 on the AP exam.  As of today, I am fluent in C++ and Java.  Instead of writing a huge wall of text Ill just detail the specifics of my CS background.  Anything I list below I have a great understanding of and can code from scratch.


* 	**Object Oriented programming (C++ and Java)**

*      Methods, Objects, Polymorphism, Inheritance, etc.   

* 	**Data Structures**

*     - Queues, Stacks, Lists (single,  double, circular)
        - Binary Trees (ADT, Red-Black) 
        - Maps, Hash Maps, and Dictionaries
        - Graphs (Dijkstra's algorithm, FloydWarshall algorithm, MST, etc)
        - Hashing
        - Search / Sort algorithms
* 	**UI design**
*     - JavaFX, AWT

This list goes on. Like I had mentioned, my understanding of Java and C++ is fairly in-depth.  

I have no problem with things like pointers, iterators, input/ output, method and operator overloading; the little things I see many of my classmates skim over and never really learn the ins and outs of.  Aside from school I have made a huge effort to push myself to learn as much as I can on my own: constantly trying to find more advanced ways of completing assignments, and spending way too much time on sites like Stack Overflow.  I have no issue following previously determined style guides and code documentation standards, and have some experience with HTML, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.  As for program development, I have done several team projects using AGILE, specifically JIRA.

Im sure there are a dozen things I havent listed that I know as well, but you get the idea.  With this information, any tips or advice on finding internships, building a better resume, etc. would mean *a lot*.  I know I can code well, but not being able to use all these skills I have spent hundreds of hours learning and practicing has got me in a slump.  Its somewhat exhausting to spend so much time with something and have little to show others for it.   It would just be nice to get a foot in the door, and have some sort of tangible reward for all the hard ward I have put in thus far.


For those of you that spent to time to read this, *I really appreciate it*.",3,4,False,self,,,,,

I'm talking with my employers about tuition reimbursement. They pay up to 100% of tuition costs depending on the prices, so it's really opened up the door to go after a computer science degree. I have a quick question though regarding two aspects of the education though.

Currently I work 3rds and am supporting a family. So online school is really the best/only option right now. That said, what are some things I can do/learn on my own to jump start my way into computer science, or to get a feel for things early on?

I'm new to programming and am having some trouble with an assignment. I'm not able to see my professor this weekend and would like to have made some progress before I head to his office hours on Wednesday. If anyone is willing to help, that'd be much appreciated. The assignment is as follows:

In this lab you will use your mad HTML/CSS/javascript skills to create a functioning four- operation calculator. Your calculator should have two input boxes in which the user can type numbers (16 and 5 in the example). The user will then press one of the buttons to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the two numbers. The result is displayed under the input boxes.

Requirements:
1. Use &lt;div&gt; blocks to group and align the inputs, buttons, result, and the Calc-O-Matic label, and for any styling that you want to apply.
2. The CLEAR button should clear both input boxes and also hide the result
3. The result area should remain hidden until a value is calculated
4. If the value is negative, the result should be displayed in red text
5. Try to make your calculator prettier that the rough sketch shown above

You are free to make your calculator as fancy as you like using styles, as long as it meets the requirements. To turn in your homework, submit all of the files necessary to run your calculator...the easy thing to do is to have everything in one file, and thats fine, but we often separate the CSS, Javascript, and HTML into individual files.

I'm a current senior in undergrad (graduating Dec. 2015), and I'm starting to think about pursuing a graduate degree. 

I'm studying at a good school, not T1 but pretty good and we'll respected, and I've been doing quite well. I have a lot of teaching assistant positions as well as industry internships. 

I have a few concerns with going straight into industry. The first is that I do not know what subset of computer science is what makes me tick. And the second is that I'm worried that I would be bored with my work. 
My cousin works at one of the top tech companies in the world, and when I moat recently asked him about if he's working on anything interesting, he basically said that his work was quite boring. 

My professors have told me that if I get a graduate degree, when I move into industry I would work on more interesting projects and be challenged a lot more. Have people found this to be the case? 

On the other hand, I  won't have the chance to get any research experience while in undergrad. Thus, I am worried that I might not enjoy research once I am exposed to it. 

I guess my main question is this, would lacking a graduate degree block me out of upward mobility and/or interesting projects?

So I'm a bit out of my depth with this, but I'm trying to implement a Monte Carlo Simulation in a Java Program. I'll explain the scenario I'm trying to do this in:

Question 1)
I have some log files from a website, I want to use this data as a simulation over how a website behavior might act. Am I correct in saying that to implement Monte Carlo (Perhaps you have another simulation technique I should look into?) I draw N random samples(how do I determine N?) of size X(how do I determine sample size?), and by doing so I have implemented Monte Carlo?..

As you see my understanding of Monte Carlo is quite bad.. Perhaps ELI5, haha...

Question 2)
To add to the simulation problem, the logs I have there is a time column, if I want to build a simulator that ""sends"" the simulator outputs at reasonable time intervals, how would I do this? 


Example on how the data would look (say I have about 300k of similar logs) the logs represent that someone made a click on a website at what time and what they clicked:

* time, url
* 23:50:01, button531
* 02:20:01, button421

So according to this, the algorithm is supposed to run at O(n).

From Bill Bryson's ""The Information"":

&gt; Landauer devoted his career to establishing the physical basis of information. ""Information Is Physical"" was the title of one famous paper, meant to remind the community that computation requires physical objects and obeys the laws of physics. Lest anyone forget, he titled a later essay--his last, it turned out--""Information Is Inevitably Physical."" Whether a bit is a mark on a stone tablet or a hole in a punched card or a particle with spin up or down, he insisted that it could not exist without some embodiment. Landauer tried in 1961 to prove von Neumann's formula for the cost of information processing and discovered that he could not. On the contrary, it seemed that **most logical operations have no entropy cost at all**. When a bit flips from zero to one, or vice-versa, the information is preserved. The process is reversible. Entropy is unchanged; no heat needs to be dissipated. Only an irreversible operation, he argued, increases entropy. Landauer and Bennett were a double act: a straight and narrow old IBM type and a scruffy hippie (in Bennett's view, anyway). The younger man pursued Landauer's principle by analyzing every kind of computer he could imagine, real and abstract, from Turing machines and messenger RNA to ""ballistic"" computers, carrying signals via something like billiard balls. He confirmed that a great deal of computation can be done with no energy cost at all. In every case, Bennett found, **heat dissipation occurs only when information is erased. Erasure is the irreversible logical operation. When the head on a Turing machine erases one square of the tape, or when an electronic computer clears a capacitor, a bit is lost, and then heat must be dissipated**. In Szilrd's thought experiment, the demon does not incur an entropy cost when it observes or chooses a molecule. **The payback comes at the moment of clearing the record, when the demon erases one observation to make room for the next**. Forgetting takes work. ""You might say this is the revenge of information theory on quantum mechanics,"" Bennett says.

In practice, what does this mean? Is it just a theoretical insight as to how information processing increases entropy, or does it have implications for hardware and software design?",1,2,False,self,,,,,

UCSC: closest to home and Silicon Valley, least competitive, but lowest ranked among these four colleges, and not a big fan of the redwood trees.

UCI: has its own CS school (separate from engineering) and higher ranked than UCSC, but it's known to be a commuter school with a very spread out campus.

UW (Seattle): didn't get directly admitted for CS, so I will most likely end up majoring in Informatics or something similar.  However, students are still allowed to take many CS classes even as a non-CS major.  It also has the nicest campus.

UMD: High-ranked CS program, but farthest away from home.  Don't know much about the campus and location.

I am considering University of Washington and University of Portland. UW is a great school and in state tuition is amazing, but I was not a DA into CSE so I would have to apply in. CS is one of the most competitive, if not, the most competitive major at UW and only has limited resources so they have about a 30% acceptance rate. UP is a good school and I'm already in the CS program so I dont have to be worried about trying to get in but there are a lot of factors involved with my decision, and this has been eating away at me for weeks. Also I apologize now for this being a long post.
Factors:
-Cost of Attendance: UW is ~$25,000, UP is ~$31,000
-Location: I live in Vancouver so Portland is super close to home, not really into that. Seattle is a beautiful city and is great. 
-Major: Would have to apply in at UW (very competitive), already accepted at UP
-Martial Arts: I do martial arts so going to UP would allow me to continue my training with my current school, UW has a club of my same style but they lack some aspects though it does allow me to expand my horizons
-UP is catholic, UW is not religious, I am not religious and am not a fan of it
-Ranking: UW CS is almost comparable to Stanford, UT Austin, Purdue, etc. UP is good but not the best. 
-Jobs: Seattle area has lots of potential for great careers, Portland too but not as much. 
-Incoming Credits: UW offers ~45 credits for anyone coming in with an IB diploma (me), UP only offers credits for test scores
(Above are in no particular order)
Lastly, my heart has been set on UW for a while; it seems like where I belong. But I am trying to think as best as I can with logic rather than emotion. Again, sorry for the long post. Any advice, help, or anything really, would be greatly appreciated.

    19.7 Format your newly created partitions (mkfs.ext4 for root, mkswap for your swap partition and mkfs.vfat for your EFI boot partitions)
    19.8 Mount your root partition on /mnt and your first boot patition on /mnt/boot/efi (You'll need to create this folder). ""swapon"" your swap partition.
    19.9 I used a USB to Ethernet adapter, and the installation CD configured it automatically. If you need to configure wireless settings, please refer to the ARCH Wiki Guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php..._configuration
    19.10 Edit the /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist and comment out any unnecessary mirrors.
    19.11 Execute the following command ""pacstrap /mnt base""
    19.12 Wait for the base packages to download and install
    19.13 Generate your fstab file by issuing the following command: ""genfstab -U -p /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab""
    19.14 ""chroot"" into your newly created environment by typing this command: ""arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash""
    19.15 Uncomment the needed locales in /etc/locale.gen, then generate them with: ""locale-gen""
    19.16 Execute the following command: # echo LANG=your_locale &gt; /etc/locale.conf (where your_locale matches your keyboard and language settings)
    19.17 Create a new initial RAM disk with: ""mkinitcpio -p linux""
    19.18 Set your root password with ""passwd""
    19.19 Create a new user for yourself with the following command: ""useradd -m -G wheel ""
    19.20 Set password for your user with ""passwd ""
    19.21 Upgrade pacman db with ""pacman-db-upgrade"", allocate the repositories with ""pacman -Syy"" and Install the sudo package with ""pacman -S sudo""
    19.22 Add your newly created user to the sudoers file located in ""/etc/sudoers""
    19.23 Switch to your newly created user with ""su ""
    19.24 Go into your user home directory ""/home/""
    19.25 Install packer dependencies with ""sudo pacman -S base-devel fakeroot jshon expac git""
    19.26 Create a new directory to download pkgbuild ""mkdir pkgbuild""
    19.27 Install wget and vim with ""sudo pacman -S wget vim""
    19.28 Get into the pkgbuild directory and run ""wget -c https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pa/packer/PKGBUILD""
    19.29 Execute the ""makepkg"" command inside that directory
    19.30 Install the newly created package with ""sudo pacman -U packer-*-pkg.tar.xz""
    19.31 Go up one level
    19.32 Download my pre-patched, pre-compiled grub2 binary from ""http://www.nocreado.com/grub-git.tar.gz"" (this one includes Andreas Heider patch to trick the bootloader with ""apple_set_os"")
    19.33 Run ""tar xvzf grub-git.tar.gz""
    19.34 Switch to the grub-git directory
    19.35 Run the following command: ""makepkg -si --skippgpcheck"" to install my version of grub
    19.36 If everything went fine, then you're ready to install and configure grub. First thing you'll need to do is tweak the ""/etc/default/grub"" file and add ""libata.force=noncq"" to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT parameter, it should end up looking like this: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet libata.force=noncq""
    19.37 Install grub with the following command: ""grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=grub --recheck --debug""
    19.38 Generate your grub configuration file with the following comand ""grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"" (This should reconize your vmlinuz images and your Windows installation).
    19.39 If everything went well, go to your / and create a new mountpoint for your extra boot partition (e.g. sudo mkdir /loader).
    19.40 Mount your patition there, switch to that folder.
    19.41 Touch a file named ""mach_kernel""
    19.42 Create the following path inside the folder: ""System/Library/CoreServices""
    19.43 Switch to that newly created directory (CoreServices) and vim a file named SystemVersion.plist with the following contents:
    Code:
        Edit: Please refer to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x for the file contents configuration
    19.44 In that same directory, generate your boot.efi image by issuing the following command: ""grub-mkstandalone -o boot.efi -d /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi -O x86_64-efi /boot/grub/grub.cfg""
    19.45 Reboot into OS X.
    19.46 Mount your extra boot partition with diskutil ""sudo diskutil mount /dev/diskXsY""
    19.47 Bless your new partition with the following commands:

    sudo bless --folder= 
    --file=/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi --setBoot
    sudo bless --mount= --file= /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi --setBoot

    19.48 If everything went well, restart your computer holding the option key. You should be able to reach your arch installation by selecting the ""efi boot"" Volume and Arch Linux from the grub boot menu.
    19.49 Once back in arch, download and compile https://github.com/0xbb/gpu-switch
    19.50 Reboot into OS X, select the new EFI Volume ""Arch Linux"" as your main disk in the Startup Disk Applet.
    19.51 Reboot your computer, you should be able to reach Grub without holding down the option key
    19.52 Boot into Arch, execute sudo ./gpu-switch -i
    19.53 Do ""sudo reboot""
    19.54 Once you're back in grub, click the ""c"" key to enter the console, type the command ""apple_set_os"" in the prompt.
    19.55 Click ""esc"" and boot into windows, You should be able to see 2 display adapters!!!

I ask this because I recently networked with a family friend at a funeral and she put in a very good word about me to her son, a hiring manager at Toshiba. He just emailed me saying I was recommended from a highly reputable source and that he wants to talk to me. What do I need to prepare for this?

I'm someone who is considering taking up CS as a second degree option. The field fascinates me and it seems like a very practical and job-applicable field. However, I'm concerned about the potential math difficulty the field proposes.

I'm not abysmal at math, but I'm no genius either. My undergrad degree is a business-related one, so there wasn't a huge amount of math required; I would need to start with Calc I to get into a program. However, I understand my own limits; I don't see myself having top-tier math skills as language/soft concepts are significantly stronger for me.

Is CS a hopeless field for me then? I understand that programming /=/ Computer Science, so I'm not going to naively assume that any programming skill would translate into being great at CS with subpar math skills.
