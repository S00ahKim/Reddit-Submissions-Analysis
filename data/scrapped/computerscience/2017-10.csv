I recently completed an internship with a focus on full stack web development. However, I have a very strong interest in geography and maps and feel I would love to focus my career in that direction. I have one free elective left, and when I spoke to my advisor about my interest, she recommended I take a GIS course to familiarize myself with all of the software and was extremely enthusiastic about just how many industries use geographic software and for so many purposes. I will be trying to get into that course if I can. Until then, I've started the Coursera UC-Davis Intro to GIS course, have downloaded ArcGIS, and am going through the interactive ArcGIS book. My favorite courses I've taken so far have been Numerical Methods, Database Design, and Adv. Data Structures and Algorithms. It seems like a lot of that stuff is used if I go this direction.

So, my question is, what sorts of jobs should I expect and in what industries? What can I be doing to focus on that path? What CS skills are needed in these sorts of jobs? Any other advice you can give me? Thank you so much for your time and your input.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

My idea was as follows:

In an emergency: Establish an opensource, battery and solar powered, wifi hotspot. Not to link to the internet as that is costly and difficult to maintain, but to display a website that disseminates useful information. 

It would utilize a redirect of some sort, similar to how the hotel's networks take whatever website you request and redirect it to their splash/registration page if you haven't already logged in. That page could host information that could be useful in an emergency. Like a local area map showing where the Red Cross is in your area, a schedule of when and where food and water deliveries are happening, where that fresh water spring that not everyone knows about is, who to see to get contacts out, what office is handling what etc... Kind of like an Emergency FAQ.

I am a fairly nerdy guy, but this is past my skill level. I am a wintel guy of limited skill and I don't want to invest much REAL money in it so ServerR8, etc are out. At first I was thinking of tinkering with a little linux box running a DHCP, DNS, and a simple webhost. but that became pretty daunting as I don't really know anything about it other than a couple of slackware boxes. Besides that the goal is simple, small footprint, small energy consumption.

Then I remembered re-flashing my wifi router at one point a few years ago with some software so I looked it up. Now I am at DD-WRT, but I'm not sure that is the cleanest and easiest thing to implement.

So far I have a hazy image of a Linksys or something running DD-WRT with some configuration of NOCAT or something. I would like it to host a simple HTML page with a couple of embedded maps etc. No outside link and no matter what you do it always ends up back at that page. I don't want someone to try to go to Yahoo and then not be able to find their way back. 

I think I have an old wrt54g in the basement someplace to play with, but if not ~60 at amazon is cool for a Proof of Concept. 

Goals:
A single box, implemented or supplemented with power (batt &amp; solar) supply considerations. Does not need to cover a huge area, I'll possibly do an external elevated antenna, but I'll worry about that later; RF isn't my problem. 

Ease of upkeep after initial installation. Some of the Linksys boxes have USB, could updating be as simple as keeping the same HTML file name and swapping out memory sticks that have been updated off site? 

Needs:
Some guidance on implementation. Ideally someone could point to a walkthrough or something and say stop at step 9, then put your HTML file on a memory stick and name it index.html, put x:/index.html in this field on this screen and you are done. ",3,5,False,self,,,,,

This Data Structure and Algorithm class I'm taking is slowly destroying what I thought I use to know as a CS major.

To add on to this, if I'm really fucked because of my lack of mathematical knowledge, would software development or 'computing' on it's own be a better degree to try and switch to? I know that programming is what I want to do but I haven't decided on a career yet.

* languages and frameworks: you can imagine it as a tree where each language can have multiple frameworks (i.e java -&gt; struts, spring, hibernate, javascript -&gt; jquery, angular)

* concepts: these are language independent although some may be applicable to only 1 language or framework (i.e design patterns, software life cycles, readability, truthiness [afaik only applies to javascript])

* tools: this is software that helps you write, debug and deploy code such as IDEs, web-servers, debuggers etc.

You can understand concepts and how to use tools, but if you don't know a concrete language or framework you won't be able to implement anything. Similarly,
you can know a language but if you don't know the concepts or tools your software will probably be shit.

My previous 3 where all business major stuff so essentially Im starting from scratch because I had no advisor help and wasted a lot of my time (I wouldnt say completely wasted because I still learned a lot of valuable things). 
    Basically right now Im working 30 hours a week and taking 15 credits. As of right now I have 0 free time, that on its own sucks. The worst thing is I still am not getting all my work done. I am someone who takes a lot of time to study it but once I get it its there for good. This on its own is bad being there is a lot of material I am missing and falling behind on. 
     Not only am I not learning everything I should but I am starting to get serious health issues. I am only 20 (almost 21) and I already have a bulging disk in my back causing it to pinch my sciatic nerve and cause extreme pain. The main reason for this is because I am constantly sitting. I am sitting at work, in class, and at home while studying. One of the best ways to fix my back without doing surgery is lots of exercising which I really dont have the time to do. 
      I never wanted to take our student loans but I am starting to think thats the best route. I am extremely good with money and know how to use it responsibly. My biggest fear is not being able to afford my bills and go late even just one month. So it scares the hell out of me to go take out a bunch of money in loans and not be able to find a job 6 months after graduating and not be able to pay my loans back. Schooling costs alone arent that bad but its the living expenses that add up. I would estimate it would cost me between $50,000-$70,000 to get my 4 year degree.
        My biggest fear is taking that $70k in loans (which I doubt it will be thats just the high side to be safe) would be around $777 a month in payments and if I dont get a CS or CE related job I dont think I would be able to afford this. I know this isnt a personal finance reddit or anything but I figured I would come here since CS and CE majors tend to earn more than most other 4year degrees. 
       Has anyone went this route and had it pay off? I dont want to take less of a coarse load because the extra money I could make in the 2 or 3 extra years it takes me to graduate far our weighs any interest I would be accruing. For example I make around $25,000 a year and according to my engineering book CE students make around $70,000 a year out of college thats a extra $45k a year. Thats $90k I lost out on if it takes 2 extra years and $135k if its a extra 3. There is no way interest will be that much not to mention I will pay the loan off before the 10 years.

I would pursue this course either full-time or part-time, depending on what job I have, beginning Fall 2018 at the earliest. I need to fulfill some math requirements before then (specifically Calc I&amp;II and Linear Algebra). I'm allowed to take those within the first year of the Master's program.

What do you guys think? Pursue my Master's? Just work for FedEx as long as I can and learn as many coding languages as possible while trying to get in with Google without grad school? 

tl;dr... Master's in CS for Google or try to up my game while working for FedEx as a developer?

Any and all book/site recommendations for math or coding is much appreciated.

I know that there is a loop from lines +64 to +78, it runs 12 times. each time it is running, it adds 15 to %ecx, and saves %ecx a that, so at the end of the loop, %ecx should equal 180. %edx acts as a counter and ever time the loop is run, it subtracts 1 from it until it is 0, making it exit the loop.

Upon exiting the loop, it should compare %eax, which I think should be 15, however it keeps jumping to explode bomb.

After that comparison, there is another to %ecx, which I think should be 180.

This is where I am stuck, I keep exploding at the first comparison, and I'm unsure what to do next.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

My class is in french which makes translating terms im not very familiar with to english sometimes an issue, add to that that often the resources i find are more aimed at electrical engineering class.

My professor notes are of little help because they are often complicated for little reason i find and often have typo which just adds to my confusion. 

 My midterms is in 2 weeks and i have an homework to give back on the subject in 1 week so i really need to get down with it quick and dirty.

Usually i have good success with website like Khans academy but i cant seem to find much relevant info on there (hopefully im just dumb and looked in the wrong spots), but the way the information is structured in simple short video with a calm tutor really works well for me so if something like this exist on the subject i would be delighted but so far youtube has been more or less useful because i would really like to find one resource who suits me and use that one resource for everything without having to readjust myself to different tutor every other videos/website.

Video with examples would be best but i could work around with some good clear text based information.

I have absolutely no background in circuits in general so its really difficult for me. And i really want to get good grades in this class as it could really help me get officially in the program.

Here's a quick rundown of what was treated in the class.

- Truth Tables (how to build one)

- AND , OR, NOR, XOR gates

- Boolean Algebrea and Properties (de Morgan?)

- Karnaugh Diagram

- Multiplexer, Demultiplexer, Encoder, Decoder.

- Addition circuit (using complement of 2 for substraction and then checking for C and V to test answer), Circuit de Decalage (guessing that should translate to Bias circuit maybe, sorry)

we are also using a program called LogiSim to build Circuits.

Thanks to everyone for your time and help,

much love,

I graduated in May with a BA in Political Science.  I was enrolled in graduate school to pursue a PhD in the field, but over the summer I felt very unmotivated and did not want to undertake something that would take 4+ years and still have the questions career-wise at the end.

During my undergraduate thesis, I did some Python programming to visualize data and I really liked it.  I started to read some books and stuff related to programming and figured it would be something that I liked.  I looked into programs like the OSU post-bacc BS in CompSci, UMUC's second degree option, but because I wasn't sure if it was something I'd truly like, I decided to enroll at my county's community college for an Associate's in CompSci.  

It's my first semester and I love the material and am doing very well.  After this semester ends I plan on putting my work together on github and building a portfolio website.  I have been comparing the courses I need to take to BS CompSci degrees and there is a lot of overlap.  

That being said, are entry-level programming/web development jobs accessible to people with AS degrees?  A lot of what I see are looking for BS degrees, but I'm curious as to if I should be applying to those anyway.

After I finish the AS, I one day would maybe like to go back for a Masters in Software Engineering or something similar after I can save up some money and not ttake out so much in loans.

TL;DR: Wasn't happy with my field after graduating, chose CS to study for an Associate's as my community college.  Should I plan on going back to get a Masters, finish another Bachelors or just focus on building my skillset(s)?

I thought I would do a follow-up post that may help other people deciding whether or no Computer Science is right for them. 

My decision, after attempting to complete Discrete Math, and Introduction to Java is that I would rather have my teeth pulled out of my head while having toothpicks driven into my fingernails and having someone scoop my eyes out with a melon baller. 

I am an older twenty-something student, and I think that has had a lot to do with my decision. I came back to finish up a bachelor's degree. At first, ANY DEGREE would suffice, I just thought I'd put all those general education credits I scooped up earlier in my twenties and put them to use and try to find a job not at a retail store. 

At first, I chose Communications. Then decided that I'd rather take on something more technical because I wanted more money. I chose Computer Science. 

My experience in this course so far at the university that I am at was not the best. I understand in programming, just like in any other topic, there is a good deal of 'googling' that one may have t do to get a solution to their problem. 

The issue is, is that the professor that teach both my discrete math course, and my introduction to java course is not that best at conveying information. He speed through the slides, and does not assign any homework for use to practice with. He then every few weeks posts assignments we must complete yet we have had no actual practice writing the code, we've only been watching him write code and run it. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, but with the amount of googling I've done, and the endless nights of 3AM study sessions, I've found that Code Academy, and Team Treehouse do a better job at teaching coding than this professor does. So to  me, I'd rather put the money I'm spending towards something I can achieve, and just learn to program on my own. 

I'd say so any older CS hopefuls to maybe look at online alternatives. 

I've made the switch to Information Systems Management, and will move ahead with courses to complete that degree. I've learned sitting behind an IDE is extremely boring and unfulfilling. Hopefully this helps others out. 

The issue is that we are now pushed towards STEM degrees, because if you get a liberal arts degree you are going to be sucking cock behind a dumpster at a McDonalds to make ends meet. But we aren't preparing people for these STEM degrees thoroughly enough in high school, and we don't have professors that are with the times. ",2,2,False,self,,,,,

He's never been very motivated when it comes to school. He'd rather spend his time working on projects like writing programs than studying for tests. But I think he'd really benefit from an internship where he got to work on projects and socialise with people who are interested in the same things as him. He's always had trouble making friends (he has some now but I don't think they're a good influence on him and none of them are into IT like he is) and I think maybe an internship would give him an opportunity to make new friends and kind of force him out of his shell. I'm worried he is going to be stuck living with our dad for a long time and end up dropping out of school if he doesn't get a taste of what kind of work he could do in the future to keep him motivated.

I am not sure this is a right question but I have some problems. I graduated a community college and transferred to another place, so now I am theoretically a junior student. but the problem is, the curriculum of CS major was pretty poor in community college so I could only take CS 1301 and CS 1302, which are mainly about java.(Got A both) Recently I am trying to get an internship for career, but I am not really sure what do companies exactly want for me. What kind of programming skills are required for internship? I mean, how knowledgeable should I be? I learned only about java at school but I studied HTML, javascript and Ruby by myself. (Learned C and python a long time ago but I cannot say I remember them) 
I think.. I can understand most basic lectures on w3schools or codeacademy, but I still have nothing that I made by myself, and not sure what to do as well. so many people advised me to try to make something on my own but.. they are too difficult. 
Let's say that I learned basic arithmetic operation(the programming languages that I practiced alone) but a lot of companies are asking me to understand linear algebra(Their qualifications are usually like ""Java, JSP, JavaScript, XML,XSLT, HTML, JPA technologies"").  
Is this situation going to be better as I take more classes? I have to graduate after 3-4 semesters anyway so I'm quite desperate. The only good thing I have is my GPA(around 3.7) but I heard this is not important at all unless I try to attend graduate school. 
any tips for me? am I the only one who feel isolated? I asked other classmates about this but looked like they don't worry about this as much as I do. I am also an international student so maybe that's why I'm more nervous?

So I graduated high school this year and decided to take a gap year. Next year however I want to start some serious studying.
I want a good job and would really like to work in a company and focus on security.
What kind of school / degree should I go for?
I was looking into BCIT which apparently gives you an incredible amount of hands on experience. But you have no life, the student life is no fun, and dressed up is a sweathshirt and jeans. Not sure if that is true? Maybe someone can confirm this for me? I plan to graduate with a BTech 

I could go to UBC but honestly the computer science degree doesn't seem that interesting to me and doesn't offer allot of security/networking options and seems a bit boring to me.

I could also go to the Netherlands and study in Utrecht and graduate with a Btech in 4 years.

I get the basic idea, and I understand most of it. But there's one bit I want some clarification with. 

To begin with, we are trying to show that for any regular language *L,* any string *s* *L,* such that *s* is at least of length  *p,* must be such that *s = xyz* where the following conditions obtain:

1. *xy^n z**L*for all*n* 0.
2. |*y*| &gt; 0
3. |*xy*| *p*

Alright, we then proceed to prove that those conditions do indeed obtain for any string *s* *L,* such that *s* is at least of length  *p.*  What I don't quite understand is how condition (2) is shown. 

At one point, Sipser says that the reason that |*y*| &gt; 0 is that *y* ""was the part of *s* that occurred between the two different occurrences of [the repeating state *q*]."" Why is this? Why can't *y* be the empty string? 

My thoughts are that it is because this string *s* was assumed from the outset to be length at least *p,* where *p* is the number of states in the deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that accepts *L.* Now, this means that during the computation of *s,* some part of *s* must take us through the same state at least twice. Whatever this particular part of *s* is (I.e. that takes us through the same state twice), *that* part of *s* is called *y.* Now, this means that *y* is a substring that does in fact take us along a transition ""arrow"" exiting from some state *q,* a transition arrow that leads us into a loop that finally comes back around to *q* again. But *y* could *not* take us through such a sequence of transitions *if* |*y*| = 0, for then *y* would be the *empty string,* and empty strings cannot move us along *any* sequence of transitions in a DFA. Therefore, |*y*| &gt; 0.

Am I understanding this correctly, or am I lost?

It didnt end up so well because I cant write programs to save my life. The exam was pretty straightforward until I got up to the coding questions and my mind went completely blank. The questions were really wordy and I can never seem to be able to apply what I learn to write code. I cant think of an algorithm or create proper logic to write a program under timed pressure. When I usually code without any time constraints, I usually take quite a while to understand the question and think of an algorithm. But this is a test and I cant just take my sweet time. 

So ultimately my question is, what do I need to do to figure out how to write programs when taking a test? Ive been practicing but I always seem to forget how to write the program/come up with an algorithm a day later. I cant think like a programmer because this is unrelated to any course Ive taken. Ive taken a myriad amount of courses in college and high school (math, science, humanities) but none of them are related to computer science in terms of thinking. Clearly, somethings just not clicking in my head because there are others whove never programmed before and they are able to learn and apply everything so efficiently.

The more I read about the relevancy of C, the more I get concerned whether this topic is of particular interest going forward. At its inception, C was a ground-breaking language and has stood the test of time...so far. With more modern languages providing similar abilities, and are type-safe and flexible than C, does it still have a place in modern day computing?

Legacy code is a big deal, and a focal point of my research, but are new products coming out that mainly deal with C? I understand that operating systems and embedded systems both rely on C, but is that going to still be the case in 10-15 years?

To explain: When I use a scanner object in Java to accept user input in a loop, if the scanner is initialized outside of the loop, it doesn't clear out the input properly and thus continuously registers whatever input is put in the first time. 

I've been 'fixing' this by initializing the scanner within the loop and just having garbage collection clear the entire thing away, input and all, but this seems like it's a bit of a clodge, and there should be some better way to do this- but I'm not great at searching Stack Overflow for stuff.

For example, currently in artificial intelligence, plan on taking computer networks, software engineering, architecture, database management and algorithms. This is just a few, but with this path will I still be able to successfully get a job in CS related fields that have to do with programming and not just IT.

When I sold my old phone I looked at how to do a secure formatting to be sure that all my data was wiped out from the internal memory. Then I got interested in the topic and I searched more just for curiosity. I saw some programs/app that promise a *deleting using military algorithm* and they cost a lot, but when I try to search why do we need such algorithms, I just find that the places in the memory  where the file existed are just marked as empty. The file is deleted only when it is actually over written.  So why cant one just, I dont know, create a  File full of random values big enough to occupy all the memory space? And then maybe repeat the procedure 20 times? Am I missing something? Are there algorithms that works at the physical layer? Maybe, I dont know, some electrical trace left by the old stored bits?

There is one in particular that I would appreciate some feedback on, and I'll elaborate on it in detail since obviously not everyone on this sub has probably played Overwatch:
**Note that I am assuming a lot of things based on my observations. I have no real knowledge on the inner workings of the game.**

Every game consists of exactly 12 players who all have a number assigned to them based on their skill rating that ranges from 0 - 5000 and, after they were found to be compatible (all within a certain range) in the queue, they are all placed into a game. At that point, they are arranged into two teams of 6 such that the average skill rating (SR) difference between the two teams is minimized. *To make it clear: given an input of twelve integers, the output is two sets of six integers such that there does not exist any pair of sets of six integers with the same input where the absolute value of the difference of the averages of the two sets is less than that of the algorithm's output.*

I acknowledge that since the input size is fixed at a small number the naive approach of finding the minimum out of every possible option isn't actually **that** bad of an approach in this situation (although I may be wrong as I don't remember how to calculate the number of possibilities in this situation (and as a sidenote if any of you could tell me that I would also really appreciate that. It's been a while since I last dealt with combinatorics.)) However, for the sake of learning/practice, I want to think of an actual good algorithm for this situation. What I have so far is to simply sort the input from least to greatest, then recursively place the least and greatest integers on a team (any team, as long as they are both on the same team) and remove them from the list (obviously since there are only 12 integers you don't have to do it recursively, it's just easier to explain this way. The algorithm is the same if you just do it by accessing the individual integers 1 at a time.)

My questions are 1. Is this algorithm correct? *EDIT: It has been proven wrong, ignore this question.* and 2. Is there a different or better (in any way) approach you might take if you had to design an algorithm to do this?

**tl;dr** Given the italicized text, is the algorithm of recursively placing the highest and lowest integers on the same team then removing them from the list they're placed in correct, and is there a different and/or better way of doing this?",14,8,False,self,,,,,

I'm new to Reddit so I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct sub-reddit for this kind of post, if not please point me to a more adequate now.
I'm 21, originally from Italy, I lived in the UK for a while and now I've been living in Australia for about a year.
I've always enjoyed studying and practicing on IT related stuff, any kind. I started when I was 15, working in a computer shop, when I got to know and love everything on an hardware prospective.
Then, I studied programming in PHP, Javascript, C++ and Python(which by now I have probably almost entirely forgot).
But of all things, what I always liked most was Security(Penetration Testing/Ethical Hacking) and all Linux/Open Source related things, which I have been studying for the past 2/3 years as a self-taught.
However, I never got an actual degree as I went to an electrical engineering school and realised too late that was not for me, so I decided to still get the diploma.
Now, I'm working in IT here, and since the company I work for is pretty small, I get to do all kinds of things, from project managing to pre sales engineering and PHP programming.
So as I am sort of ""stuck"" here, I can't go to Uni due to the exorbitant University fees for foreign students and I probably wouldn't have time anyway. Therefore, I was just thinking to wait for a couple of years until I get my PR and I can enroll for university at a resonable price.
I guess my only other option would be to enroll for an online university that is located somewhere in europe, and then take the master degree here(which I am guessing is more relevant), but I have no idea if:
1) I can actually even enroll for an online university without being in that country.
2) If I could ask for a government Loan being a EU citizen like I would if I were in an actual university.
3) If an online degree is actually valid and considered legit by emloyers or they are gonna snob you cause you have one.
I'm still confused about what degree+master I should go for, I guess the best way would be an IT/Computer Science bachelor degree and a Cyber Security master(as well as all the certification you need to do this job).
I'm aware there are also bachelor degrees on Cyber Security but at that point I guess my career could only point in one direction, whereas with a general IT one, I could still change job position if I wanted to.
I would really appreciate if some of you would spend some time to answer to this post and advice on how I should proceed as I'm totally confused.

Im trying to determine which one of those options would make me the most employable at the end of my degree. Are there any websites that would be good to check out to see what the job market is like? Anyone have any advice on narrowing down complimentary majors?
What kinds of jobs could the last two lead to?

My name is Alex, and I work with computers.  I always want to keep learning, and I wanted a way to grow as a T-shaped developer.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; We value T-shaped people.

&gt; That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable thingsthe top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow disciplinethe vertical leg of the T).

&gt; This recipe is important for success at Valve. We often have to pass on people who are very strong generalists with-out expertise, or vice versa. An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesnt go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual.

*Valve Handbook for New Employees*

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to create Breadth First Growth, a weekly newsletter with tasks to complete as a way to grow and give back to the community.  I learned so much from the Reddit community when learning to code, be it through /r/learnprogramming or /r/cscareerquestions, and I wanted to share my collection of tasks with the community to help others grow as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Breadth First Growth is a way to work on small projects once a week to build your skills across computer science and web development (the horizontal part of the T).  The hope is that you'll develop some familiarity with different areas over time and gain exposures to other parts of computer science.

&amp;nbsp;


**What this is for**

* Growing as a developer
* Learning new things
* Practicing skills you've encountered but don't often use
* Gaining exposure to different areas
* Working for a couple of hours on the weekend
* Learning about foundational topics of CS if you have a self-taught
or bootcamp background
* Expanding the horizontal of your T-shaped knowledge

**What this is not good for**

* Expanding the vertical bar of your T-shape. While this will help
give you exposure to a wide variety of projects, you should absolutely
continue to develop expertise in one area!
* Resume padding (Please don't do anything like putting C on your
resume after a small project in C! That's a great way to get stuck
with an interviewer who knows C well and would love to test you)
* Passing data structure/algorithm interview questions (The projects
may occasionally have to do with DS&amp;A, but only occasionally!)
* Finding a job (slide on over to /r/cscareerquestions)
* Finding a job at Valve (definitely slide on over to /r/cscareerquestions)
* Developing expertise in a subject area (Most of these projects will
be introductory level, but feel free to follow up and learn more!)
* Furthering your expertise in a subject area (Chances are if you
think you're an expert, the projects will probably be too easy for
you! Feel free to suggest a task!)

&amp;nbsp;

**Frequently Asked Questions**

*How much money do you make from ads and sponsors?*

None, and I'll let you know if this ever changes!

&amp;nbsp;

*How much does this cost to run?*

Right now, roughly $7 per month for the domain name and hosting ($5 for droplet and roughly $21 per year for domain name, so roughly $2 per month), and we're still on Mailchimp's free tier for now which is great!    I'm very lucky to be in the position that I'm in with a job in tech, and for the price of 2 or 3 coffees a month, it's so worth it to me to share and help others learn.

&amp;nbsp;

*What's the tech stack like for the site?*

Very simply static page hosted with Nginx server on a Digital Ocean droplet with Mailchimp handling the emails.  So easy to do that setting one up might be a future project!

&amp;nbsp;

*When do you send out the projects?*

Every Saturday morning!

&amp;nbsp;

*My morning or your morning?*

US EST (GMT-4)

&amp;nbsp;

*How long should I spend on the projects?*

As long as you want!  I would roughly estimate that these tasks would take 2-3 hours or so with breaks.  I highly recommend that you take 10-15 minutes halfway through to walk around.  Great way to get unstuck!  Of course, any time estimate will vary depending on experience and familiarity with the subject.

&amp;nbsp;

*What kind of projects do you send?*

I select two different projects from two different areas in the hopes that you'll always have something to work on that you aren't already very experienced with.  For example, the first week will be a task to design a user interface and a task to work through a tutorial in C. If you're more experienced with design, then tackle the C tutorial, and vice versa!  If you feel like it, do both!

&amp;nbsp;

*What's your experience?*

I work as a front end engineer for a small startup in the Boston area. I've been working as a developer for roughly 1.5 years (18 months for the new parents out there).  I studied Physics for my undergraduate degree and am currently pursuing a masters in CS.  I learned a lot of programming and computer science through online resources, including FreeCodeCamp, CS50, EdX, Coursera, and many many others.  I don't claim to be an expert in anything, but if I know a little more than others and can help bring them up too, that's all it takes!

&amp;nbsp;

*How can I recommend a task?*

Shoot me an email at breadthfirstgrowth (at) gmail or send a pm here! I'll take a look and mention you in the email when it's shared with everyone!

&amp;nbsp;

*What can I do if I'm stuck?*

Head on over to /r/breadthfirstgrowth and post!  I can't guarantee 24 hour support, but I'll drop in when I can (especially on Saturdays) to help out.

&amp;nbsp;

*This is awesome! How can I help?*

Suggest a task or head on over to /r/breadthfirstgrowth and help out your fellow learners!

&amp;nbsp;

*How can I sign up?*

Based on what I have seen, people tend to advocate SHA-2 because it is used all around the world by governments, banks, and websites (even Reddit uses SHA-256). Meaning that if there were any backdoors or security flaws, they should have been discovered by now.

Other people believe Whirlpool is better because it does not have NSA involvement. Even though Whirlpool is rarely used by comparison and is thus more likely to have undiscovered security flaws, the fact that the NSA is not involved would mean that the creators of Whirlpool (two dudes working privately) would not be highly incentivized to create an insecure algorithm.

Both algorithms are roughly of similar security (at least, based on what we know). So ultimately the question comes down to how probable it is that SHA has a backdoor. But since SHA code is open-source, how could there be a backdoor? People don't implement closed-source SHA into their projects; they either recreate the algorithm themselves, or they copy the source code from somewhere such as https://tls.mbed.org/sha-256-source-code

The code for SHA is not ridiculously complex and does not use any closed-source libraries etc. Any backdoors would be pretty easy to spot and test, right? So why do people believe that SHA has a backdoor?",5,7,False,self,,,,,

But I haven't programmed until the semester before I got into the major and took all my easy, least time consuming courses already.  I am also generally a slow learner, but I do my time and I do my best. My logic is it doesn't matter how you do as long as you enjoy it and do your best, and yes, I am on the C-B- side if the spectrum for most courses except for a few. 

But lately, these elitest, those who are the fastest learners, or have experience, or just gets it better than I do,  make me feel like i shouldnt be here even though I think i deserve to be here because I worked to be here and that's why I got here. I spent my time looking for what I enjoy most and this is it. Even if a lot of these elitest who don't say it to me, but rather those who might complain and/or are in the same position as me (but obviously more vocal about it), the responses they get tend to make me feel crummy and depressed.

However I've been in an internship and been told I'm doing great because I do the time needed and work outside of work, so it's reassuring but I just get bothered by the elitism that tell other students they shouldn't be in the major... ",31,35,False,self,,,,,

The time for me to go to university is approaching but I still haven't decided what I want to do yet. I am currently thinking of doing Computer Networks and Cyber Security at university but I know their are better jobs opportunities with a computer science degree. The reason why I'm undecided is because I barely know any programming languages and have only done web-coding in college. I know what languages I need for computer networks because my brother is doing the same course and he is in his final year right now. I've heard that the lecturers at university don't really teach you a whole lot and you have to learn everything yourself which gets me scared that I wont learn the languages and will fail.

I'm sometimes told that I'm a fast learner but I like to say I'm in the middle because of my laziness. I believe I can learn coding quick if I put my all into it but I would need a strong motivation (I guess not failing would be one). I know I would need some programming languages for computer networks but If my brother could do it than so can I (no offence to my bro). So I want to know what would be expected of me if I pick cs and if I should start learning a particular language right away. Basically, I want to know if someone with minimal knowledge of programming languages can do well at a subject like Computer science, to give you guys something to compare against, I believe I would do well at computer networks.
I love coding but was just recently introduced to it, never did any sort of coding before college.
I want to pick it but I afraid of failing everything just because I couldn't learn something.
Please advise me on this and change my mind into picking Computer Science!

I fancy anything related to computers but this course takes things a lot more slowly and mathemathics are mostly prevalent and make up almost half of my classes. IT route has more computer based classes so I am thinking about switching but the main things I want to know are:
 
These questions relate to the US and western Europe market

 Is CS really that much more reputable?
 Is CS better for job prosperity?
 Is there a considerable difference in median pay at the jobs in each department?
 Will switching to IT degree make me a less desirable candidate for any future jobs, or if I phrase it differently, is the job market  a lot more open to CS degrees as opposed to IT?
