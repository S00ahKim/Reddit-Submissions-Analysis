I'm hoping people in the field can give me a little insight.  So far I am planning to take these 3

*operating sytems

*comparative programming languages

*concurrent and distributed systems

Now for the next 4 I can choose from

*Database concepts

*Language processors and programming environments

*Computer communications and networking

*Secure Programming and systems

*Computer Graphics

*Intro to Artificial Intelligence

*Data Mining

*Autonomous Robotics

*Computer Vision 

*Numerical Analysis (Math course but would be ""CS elective"")

I should say I don't know for sure what I want to do after college.  If I did, these choices would be alot easier.  

I think I may want to create my own AI track.  I could do something like Intro to AI, Robotics, Data Mining, and Computer Vision.  My School doesn't have an AI track, so this would just sort of be me creating my own.  I feel like to work in high level AI stuff, I will need to go to grad school.  I have &gt;3.9 gpa and a little research (in math, though), but i'm concerned with how competitive an applicant I will be since my school isn't ranked very high and theres no AI track like many top schools have.  I also don't know for sure I'll like artifical intelligence, because I haven't done much with it.  I like the intersections of math and CS, so I think it may be a good fit, however at this point I can merely say I like the idea of it, since I haven't studied it much at all.

If I didn't go the AI route, i'd probably go with something like Databases, Networking, Language processors and programming environments, and one other (maybe security).  I feel like I would really enjoy these classes, too.  They are more practical for a typical job.  That said, I think the AI classes would be more interesting to me.

Ultimately, i'm responsible for my own learning.  My thinking is that if I go the AI track, I can self teach myself database and networking concepts.  

For full disclosure, I go to George Mason.  If I went that AI path, graduated with a &gt;3.9 gpa, and published another paper in the area of AI, how are my chances at a top grad program for AI?

Background: 
I am doing computer engineering major (many hardware classes in my country)  now as a senior student with a low gpa (2.3). Although I have a really low gpa, I have an 2-years of experience in one of the most well-known software company. I am working as Microsoft full-stack developer. Also, I am giving basic private lessons about computer engineering topics (mostly C, C++, and Java). 

Last day, I got a question from my student about binary search tree. It has been 2-years to work on binary search tree and I could not answer the question completely. Though I can implement linkedlist, stack, queue, etc., more advanced topics are now forgotten (dynamic programming, binary search tree)

I like coding and I and one of my friends want to establish a software company in 5 years that makes custom softwares. 

Enough for prating. Should I go with computer science advanced topics or Microsoft technologies how-tos (ASP.Net MVC, WebForm, WPF, etc.), javascript, mssql?

I am looking for minimum specs I would need for a laptop for college. I have recently built a strong desktop (i5-4690k, 8gb, GTX 970, 250ssd, 2 tb hdd) that will handle anything I need it to while in my dorm (gaming, projects, multitasking, etc.)

However, while in class or with groups working/studying, I am going to need a laptop. What are the minimum specs I should look for that will handle the demands of a CS major for at least 3, preferably 4 of the years. I have a bunch of credits coming in, so I do need it now as I will be taking 2 major related courses every semester at least. 

I do not want to spend more than 500 on it, as I could easily just find one that will be suitable over, but I am looking for the min specs I should settle for. 

I've seen conflicting opinions on all aspects, so i'm interested in what you have to see. Gaming and entertainment are not necessary factors as those will be for more desktop, however, a display at least 1920x1080 is preferred.

I currently attend State University of New York at Buffalo and am considering switching my major to Computer Science, and I have a couple of questions for anyone who has attended or is familiar with the program. My main goal is to become a software engineer working on applications in industry.

The program is not accredited by ABET, and this makes me a bit nervous. CS is in the School of Applied Sciences and Engineering here, and while all other engineering majors are certified by ABET, CS is not. The curriculum seems comparable to other good CS programs, however (in my opinion).

Because of the way courses are sequenced here, I can complete my BS in CS in two years. I have considered transferring to Rochester Institute of Technology, Stony Brook University, or SUNY Brockport, all of which have ABET accredited programs. Brockport would also only take two years to complete, but RIT and Stony Brook would likely take longer (with RIT actually taking roughly four more years including two semesters of co-op). Living costs are also significantly higher near Stony Brook (1200/month for rent vs 400 in Buffalo or Rochester) and RIT's tuition is MUCH higher than the state schools, of course. RIT's co-op program is excellent, however, and the school also offers a BS degree in Software Engineering as well (first in the country).

My fiance also works in Rochester, NY, so this is a great consideration for me. If I were to transfer to Stony Brook, say, she would have to look for a job in Long Island or NYC, and there is no telling how long this job search may take.

Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

I love programming, and I've been thinking about taking out a fatty loan to get a degree in CS. However, I've been reading a lot about H-1B workers snatching up a lot of American IT jobs. So would the degree be worth the 20-30k in loans? What skill sets are most in demand/anticipated to be in demand, and least likely to be outsourced? Thanks in advance. ",19,0,False,self,,,,,

On SAP the job description is more about technical support, communication and troubleshooting (not helpdesk), while on the other company there is more focus on the technical part (Oracle db, networking, managing servers, like a junior sysadmin role). Another perk of the other company is that they took a strong liking on me and that's definitely positive. Salary is the same in both.

On SAP there's the future value on the CV and great career development, while on the other role I think I'm going to learn a great deal about Oracle DBs and networking (also travelling on customer sites/servers) while on SAP I'll stick with SAP products.

Potential future job is Sysadmin although I have no idea what will happen until then.
