I am a junior in CS, I'm looking to learn web development on the side so I have some practical coding experience.  I've been wanting to do this for a long time but there always seems to be too many resources to choose from and I just end up doing nothing because its too overwhelming.  I recently came across a deal on Udemy.com for C++ and Unreal 4, which lead me to see some courses listed as ""The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp"", or something similar.  I was about to purchase one because it was only $15, but I figured that might be stupid given that there is a ton of free resources on the internet.  I figure its time I pick one site and stick to it so that I can finally learn this.  These are the ones I'm looking at:

* [Udemy Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/#curriculum)
* [Udemy Web Developer Course w/ Projects](https://www.udemy.com/web-developer-course/)
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* [University of Reddit](http://www.ureddit.com/)

Can anyone speak to their experiences with these? Is there one that stands out?  Should I just buy the Udemy course?  Any other suggestions are welcome too.  Thank you!

I am doing some work and am seeing two different answers. I was using a calculator (online) to check my answer and it is clashing with the answer I am supposed to get and I need to see which one is correct.

The problem is -6.25

I worked this out for 6.25 and then took the twos complement.
6.25 --> 0110.001 
Mantissa --> 0.11000100000                  Exponent--> 0011
My Answer:
Two's Complement            1.00111100000        Exponent-->     0011

The answer I should be getting says:
Mantissa --> 1.11000100000         Exponent -->  0011

It doesn't seem to make sense that all you do is add a 1 in front of the positive Mantissa. I know that if the sign bit is a 0 it is a positive number and a 1 is a negative number. Could you please let me know which one is correct or if either of these are correct please? Thanks. Just want to make sure I am doing it right before I continue.",1,6

So I just graduated college from a really reputed engineering school with a degree in computer science. I was born and went to school in the same city. So suffice to say I was sick of living in the same city for 23 years. I wanted to see what else was in the world and wanted to put some distance between me and my family. I just needed to get away. I got offered a job in another city and I took it. I knew the job was not my dream job but I realized this was a great opportunity to just get away.

So this job. I knew from the start this was going to be a support job. The job title is software engineer. But the work attached to it is anything but software engineering. This job has no programming whatsoever and I had no idea it would be this bad. Yes, they did tell me this was a support job but the job title led me to believe I would actually be gaining skills to advance my career. I now know this job is a 100% support and IT job and has nothing to do with software engineering. They said there would be programming in this position but I am finding programming tasks only come after working at the company for 3 or more years. My job is essentially granting access to users who request it. I use software, I don't write software. I don't even know why they hire computer science graduates. 

What do you advise me to do? It looks really bad to join a company and leave immediately. I won't be doing that. I want to stick it out for at least 8 months. But I have to find another job. I'm not going to hurt my software engineering career by staying loyal to any company. Not to mention the salary they offered is on the low end and I paid for my own relocation expenses. ",36,12

I think the biggest thing is how we constantly compare ourselves with other people, instead of working at our own pace. All of them seem really depressed and chose either weed/tobacco to deal with the stress. My relationship with my friends has turned into all of us talking about how this issue burdens us. I dont touch weed, or any drugs. But due to the stress this caused me I now am fighting a tough tobacco addiction. I hope people read this and see that there is alot of people struggling with this issue of college/uni entry at a older age. Your not alone, even though you may feel alone.

The problem is I have almost no background in this subject, I know some bash and C, a little bit of python. I'm 23 and have friends that already finished their BS, I feel like its way too late to start now. Older people told me I wont enjoy work when the person giving me tasks in younger and has less life experience than me. Sounds reasonable to me.

I don't know if I should go to university or not, maybe some other way to get education might me appropriate?

Anyway I applied and got accepted in  computer engineering and business computer science (translated from German, should be equal to computer science with minor in business?) still waiting on the reply for computer science

If I should start to study which degree would prepare me best?

I took a look at the available courses at the different schools:

Computer engineering:

* engineering basics

will this help me in any way? I like physics  but unsure about the gain

* lots of electrical engineering 

Again I don't know this could help me later

* many embedded and embedded security courses
* secure computers/networks/services
* introduction to hacking

the computer science degree offers a focus on IT-security with all security courses from computer engineering and many many more from cryptography to human hacking. Business CS would have the same courses available but I can take less. (from the same university)

I heard a lot from computer science guys the don't have to required knowledge about electrics. So might could it be worth to chase CE?

I like business a lot too, so there would be no personal problem for me going this path. 

At may age would it make sense to finish a masters degree?
so in my eyes the combination of BE in computer engineering and a master in CS with focus on security should be pretty good?

Another Problem. Can't move since I own a apartment and don't want to sell, I'm bound to my location (renting to somebody would be stressful and I don't know if I could count on the rent each month). for CS/Business I would need to travel 200km to get there and back each day, which is time consuming. 
Would decide that way only if there are major advantages against computer engineering.




Bonus question: 
Best way to prepare? Currently I'm reading learning python and reading computer networks by Tannenbaum. What should I pickup after this?

This may be a somewhat long read, but any advice or input would be beyond appreciated.  This is my 4th year in uni, and I'm a Finance major.  I've come to realize I really don't have a genuine interest in Finance.  

I got into this major because my grandpa was a very successful financial advisor (multi-millionaire) and he said I would have opportunities available at his firm once I graduated.  Sadly, he died in December.  It was a very emotional time, because not only had I lost my grandpa, I realized I had wasted four years of my life in a major I didn't want because of the prospect of wealth and job security I could have working for him.

Whenever someone would ask me ""why Finance?"", I would never know how to answer, other than ""I think Finance majors make a lot of money"", which should have been a big red flag.  I'm just over a year away from graduating in Finance, but I've realized CS is the major I really want.

I know very little about programming, but I've been learning on my own.  I'd like to be a software engineer or full stack developer!  I want nothing more than to be in this field building things and actually creating.  I've learned the fundamentals of HTML/CSS on my own just because they're the easiest to start with, and I've started learning Javascript.

Regret is the first thing I feel when I wake up everyday, because I know this is the major I should have been in from the start.  If I were to change majors now, I would be in school for three more years, as opposed to just over a year if I stuck with Finance.  I'm torn between staying the course to go work a job I don't care for, and staying in school to do what I actually want to do.  What do you think would be best?

TL;DR 4th year student, just now realized I'm in the wrong major, is it too late to change to CS?",9,9

However, I'm not sure where to start. I have some ideas but I feel like they're a little bit too ambitious and out of my depth with where I'm at concerning my knowledge of CS.

I'm interested in programming some stuff around music, basketball, easier computer functionality. And I'd be pretty interested in doing anything like web development, robotics, app development, browser extension development, etc.

Some ideas I had:

Predict first week album sales for a record

. Basically aggregate and compare stats from Youtube video counts, social media followers, Google Trends, single chart positions and sales, and prior album performances in order to generate an estimated figure for an artist's first week album sales numbers or even just to predict what an artist would sell if they were to release an album right now. I don't know if I can do this because it seems like a lot of statistics and math involved, and formula writing. And maybe some other stuff I haven't even thought of that I'm not qualified to do.

Mac Desktop App that automatically moves all files with a video extension in Videos folder, everything with image extension to Pictures folder

. Wouldn't even know where to start with this one

Music Pirater

. Input a song or album, then the application would automatically search on trusted music pirating sites for artist + song or artist + album, and generate a link to a page with a download. This would require me to aggregate some music pirating sites and access their search functions somehow. 

These are just some ideas, that I don't know if I can do as something for a beginner with relatively limited knowledge and experience. I can do Java, but I'm a rising sophomore CS student who's only learned as far as Data Structures for now, so I don't know. Any suggestions for something I can do, as well as if you think those ideas are too ambitious for me?

However, now since i'm signing up for classes, I've realized I can graduate with a CS degree due to AP credits I accumulated in high school. One of the course advisers (and my parents) suggested I look into a dual major with CS from the science college and Computer Engineering from the engineering college. However, this would mean I would have to spend the four years at college.

So, I'm left with two options.
1) Graduate in 3 years with a computer science degree. 
2) Graduate in 4 years with a computer science AND computer engineering 

Both are tempting offers. However, I don't intend to have a career in computer engineering. I love software, web, and AI development. I've interned at several large companies doing web development, both front and back end work (but simplified for interns), and I loved it. 

So this boils down to one question. Reddit, a dual major make a huge difference in employment, salaries, etc, over a regular CS degree in 3 years? Vice versa? Is a three year degree better or worse than a regular four year degree?

As of one year ago, I had no knowledge about computer science, but decided to pursue my MS in Software Engineering. As such, I have spent the last 8 months completing introductory courses at the university (Discrete Math, Intro to Programming, Computer Systems I & II, Data Structures I & II). 

A family member of mine who has been a software engineer for the last 25 years recommended to me to instead pursue the MS Cybersecurity degree, stating that cybersecurity is in high demand and low supply, with the industry only looking to grow in the future. He said that software engineers are a dime a dozen in today's saturated market, and that now is a good time to specialize in cybersecurity. 

Both degrees require the same introductory courses. I am approaching the end of my intro courses, and need to make a decision about which program to pursue. I've greatly enjoyed the programming elements of my classes thus far, would love to pursue programming further. Is there a significant programming element within the field of cybersecurity? I wasn't sure whether cybersecurity involves a lot of just looking at assembly language. 

I've also been reading on some online forums that a degree in Cybersecurity is not a good investment, since many employers simply look for security certifications.

20 years old from the East Coast, graduated high school with my associates of arts so I spent my last two years pursuing classes towards a CS degree before running out of scholarship money and ultimately settling with graduation with in Information Systems (IS) degree.

I took procedural programming (algorithmic design I and II) and my school focused on Java. Struggling to pay for rent and day-to-day expenses as i've been on my own since 15, I opted to focus on IS with scholarship requirements struggling to be met.

I got a product-based internship in college (Think mcafee installation work - ePO, DLP, ENS) and found out that's not what I wanted to do. I really wanted to program as part of a team and contribute to the building of some project.

I got an interview on the West Coast in California for an App Development company. 

During the interview, they focused mainly on things to do with the systems development lifecycle (App development, technical archietecture) and even let me see an example of a service they used online (can't remember the name).

The application allowed him to write some SQL statements and perform a task (moving a file from one location to another) using language-neutral microservices the company made. Like base frameworks, I think written in .NET, that could perform simple tasks and/or interact with other services that perform simple tasks.

The interview lasted for 9 hours, and up until that point (it was lunch) I was answering questions fine and meeting multiple members of the team.

Problem is - I didn't understand a word of it. I could speak on high-level terms about the MVC approach to solving problems (Like what it is) and idea of parnet/child relationships (i.e. when to use abstract methods/classes or interfaces), but even messed up on a few questions there.

(the biggest one was where to pass and perform actions if an interface has multiple consturctors that take in different paraments - 1 that took none - 
the 2nd that took a string and integer -
and 3rd that took multiple strings and multiple integers -
and I assumed the main constructor, with no parameters, is where I would use the information but even that made no sense after I said to one of the interviewers.)



The luncheon interviewer was the lead of the tech architecture team 

He formulated questions in such a way he saw that I had knowledge gaps with things like the common MVC patterns, what micro-services even are (I had no clue) and how to use common web-based API's to make those micro-services based on documents written up around the MVC patterns they stick to. I also had **NO CLUE ABOUT DEPENDENCY INJECTION, DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND INHERITANCE**

and I realized then that my IS, not CS, background was the biggest thing at play. My lack of knowledge of the *theory* behind the systems development life cycle stopped me from understanding how they utilize classes, import things, and pull data from one spot to the next.

Now, regardless of everything I got wrong, I got the job. I start at the end of the month, and believe they use .NET, not Java, which i've never used. I don't know where to begin preparing other than researching, generally, the ideas and theories that I obviously needed to work on. 

I spent 3 weeks studying algorithms before I got there to find out that it was basically useless, lol. I'm not terrified, but very concerned my lack of technical programming (i'm most **but not extremely** proficient in java, and can write simplistic HTML, CSS, and javascript after googling the problem at hand to sorta relearn the common patterns at play to pass data. I don't know the JSON format very well and only know simplistic Javascript from the JQUERY libraary to pass data to a SQL server. I'm not too proficient in SQL, but the statements are pretty straightforward and I believe I could google any common statment I meed need to use before/on-the-job.)

**TLDR:**

I got an job on an App Dev team, I believe as an Application developer, and understand *minimal* information on micro-services, .NET (never used it, have used Java), dependency injection, and how to write code that can utilize frameworks and language-neutral services that the company uses. SQL is shaky (1/2 year usage), with about 1- 1 & 1/2 years with Object Oriented Programming languages (java)). Had a 9 hour interview, 9 different people, only the Technical Architecture Lead portion made me feel unqualified for those reasons I stated above.

3) Will I be at a disadvantage if I don't have a BS in Computer Science when applying for tech jobs as an Applied Math or Math/Econ major?
4) How do I make up for the fact that I am not going to graduate with a BS in CS as an Applied Math or Math/Econ major?

I am a PhD student looking into developer behavior regarding deprecated features in an API. When a feature of an API is deprecated, developers should ideally react to this deprecation by replacing the deprecated call. However, we see that predominantly developers do not react to deprecation and this led us to question as to why that is the case?

I'm a military veteran going to school to gain a BS in Computer Science on the post 9/11 GI Bill, currently entering into my sophomore year in a community college in Fort Worth, Texas. I have yet to see any kind of coding class or (apart from math) computer science related course, and this worries me because I aim to become a Software Engineer post academia. So far, I've been instructed by my college's veteran councilor to take, in the previous year, 2 English courses (1302 was completed at an honors level), 2 history courses, 2 government courses, 3 math courses, and an elective in macroeconomics. I'm registering for classes this week for the fall 2017 semester and I've felt so far like the school veteran councilor is just eating my GI Bill money by giving me seemingly generic classes to take. I plan to transfer to a university for next fall and wanted to make sure I'm doing what I need to be doing/ not wasting money/time. What are your thoughts on this? Did you guys take any comp sci specific courses if you went to a community college beforehand? What would you recommend for classes before my councilor gives me suggestions?

The books would essentially be the recommended textbooks that accompany CS classes. Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, Introduction to Algorithms, The Design of the Unix Operating System, etc.

The motivation for this is my own desire to begin tackling CS concepts that go beyond articles, guides (things like [A Gentle Introduction to Complexity Analysis](http://discrete.gr/complexity/) and [Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/), etc), and the typical exposure that comes from working as a software engineer. While all of these are great ways to learn naturally I'm finding there are some concepts and subject areas that would benefit from **systematic study**. 

Given the complexity and length of study (estimating about 2-3 months for the average textbook), I think it would be much more engaging to have a peer group to learn from and be accountable to (this is the big one) than attempt to go at it on my own.

Anyone interested? Looking for those who might be in a similar boat as me and serious enough to meet 1x a month.

For some background of my experience level, I went to a coding bootcamp in early 2014 and have been employed as a programmer since, moving my way from front-end to full stack to backend ""software engineer"".

Know this is a bit of a shot in the dark, but if I find even one person to work with I'd consider it worthwhile. Happy to answer any &amp; all questions as well.

I really like mathematics and I'm pretty good at it. Applied Mathematics is certainly suitable for me but the thing is that I don't know if I want to choose a major that only revolves around maths. 

I also like working with technology and I have a huge passion for video games. That's why the CS major caught my interest. I have done a lot of research and I definitely took a liking to software developing and website designing. However, I have 0 experience when it comes to coding. I did a very basic programming tutorial a few days back and it was a lot of fun for me. I'd love to learn more about programming and taking this major.

I have talked to my parent about this and my dad does not support my decision at all. He is constantly arguing about how this major isn't for girls and requires people with experience. He says that CS major is for people who loves programming from a young age and started learning about it in elementary school. Even if I can make it into the major, he says that I will probably always be one of the worse and most inexperienced student and that I will have an awful time looking for jobs when everyone else is better than me. He really really really wants me to take another major like Data Science, Architecture, or something medical. Redditors who are/were in a CS major, is what my dad says true? If yes, to what extend?

Besides maths and video games, I also like art, design, photography, fashion, architecture, and biology. The reason I don't want to take the Architecture major is because it requires high grades in physics, and I am very average in physics. I don't want to study art/fashion stuff because it would be sooo hard to find a job. And I don't want to take Biology major because I'm only interested in the plants parts of it. 

Some other things I can add are that I am fairly creative and I can quickly adopt to new technology and softwares. I'm always very careful with everything to avoid mistakes and I prefer working alone and independently. Things I am bad at are languages, physical education, and writing essays.

Do you think that a Computer Science major will suit me? Even with no knowledge in programming (yet)? (I mean, we go to school to learn right?) Or is there any other major you'd like to suggest? Please, any help would be amazing! Thanks in advance :)

I'm really confused and could use some guidance. I went to OSU and graduated in 2015. At that time I graduated with a degree in Neuroscience because for the better part of a decade I had thought I wanted to go into the medical field. A month before graduating at OSU I decided I really didn't want to do it and that I was doing it for the wrong reasons. At that point I was interested in business/IT Field. I went and worked for a bank for a few months but quickly realized it wasn't what I was comfortable with. 

Since then I've been pursuing the IT Field. I learned how to do manual testing (QA) and am currently working as a manual tester. It's been an interesting journey and definitely an interesting job that I've learnt a lot from (especially in being creative with solutions and raising my technical expertise) but I wanted to get into programming/coding. I've been doing some research and came across several bootcamps that were supposed to be immersive in helping you learn from bottom up and have you work on some open source projects as well to gain real world experience. 

My question was I know if you want to go into programming you don't necessarily need a CSE degree but instead have to be very proficient in knowing a computer language and how to apply it but what if I want to be a software developer or software engineer? Is a CSE degree absolutely required? I just don't know if it's feasible or makes sense for me to go back to pursue a whole new degree at this point or if it's possible to be fine without doing that. Has anyone ever been in a similar boat or known someone with a similar circumstance like this? 

My next question was if a CSE degree was required did it need to be ABET certified? A lot of these online programs aren't and if I was to go back to pursue that I would need to do it online so that I could work full time as well to provide for my family and myself. 

My other question was if the circumstances permit, I would love to be able to get an MBA to further my career. Would that be something that is recommended in this particular field? Ultimately, I'd like to be in management (manager/supervisor etc) and I was curious if the MBA would still be useful even without a CSE degree. I guess a lot of my concern lies in the question if I need to have a CSE degree or not. 

My last question was, if I learned programming and was able to get a job as a computer programmer, was there other options in the IT Field I could pursue from there on out or are you stuck in the programming part of the IT Field indefinitely? Like what about Data administrator etc? Do those solely require CSE or is a bachelors degree sufficient if I can show competency in the required field?

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any feedback/advice on this. ",7,7

a) Enhancing my resume prior to eventual job applications in the software engineering realm.

b) Setting myself up for possible future graduate school applications for an MS in CS.

For background, I am a working professional with a humanities education. I started coding seriously about a year ago and have grown quite proficient. I plan to continue my programming education over the coming year and build a portfolio, but I am also interested in doing some formal CS education. I love coding and find myself wishing every day that I had discovered it when I was still in university. Now, I am working on my coding education full-time and will continue on that path for the next year.

Although I am increasingly confident in my coding skills, I suspect that I'll have a better shot at a career transition if I can gain a solid foundation in core CS principles as well. That is why I am investing time and energy into online CS courses with EdX, Coursera, etc. The question is whether I ought to be investing money as well. My main interest in the material is intellectual and I want to continue doing it regardless, but I recognize that future employers and/or graduate school may require some ""proof"" that I actually learned the material (beyond just portfolio projects).

For reference, I calculated out the cost of buying ""verified"" certificates for all of the required courses and it comes out to $1,712, depending on course selection.

A bit of background...I'm almost 34, have been in the auto repair industry since 18 and self employed for over half that time. Both my shoulders are getting some serious wear and tear and figure I should get out while I can still use my body. 

I've been exploring CS as it seems to have good pay and given the world we live in I like to think that this is a science/skill that can be applied in several different fields/industries. I have good critical thinking and diagnostic skills, and math has always been one of my stronger subjects. I am comfortable working with computers and typing but have literally zero experience with any coding or computer diagnosis/repair. 

Through the research I've done, I'm unclear about how I should start into this industry if I make that decision. There is a coding boot camp offered by University of Arizona that runs 6 months. The advisor explained that the main work I can expect from this is web development, either full stack, front end, or back end. When I search for web developer jobs in the area, it seems that everyone wants a BS or years of experience. How realistic is it for me to find a job that I can make at minimum $30-40K a year right out of the gate?

Is a bachelors in CS a better pursuit in the long run? Are coding boot camps and CS even comparable at all? Would a coding boot camp be a proper gateway to at least entry level work in the field while I work on the bachelors? Or if I'm pursuing the BS then boot camp is a waste of time/money?

* Quit accounting and become full time student in a post-bacc program 
* Study my GREs like hell/ take necessary classes and hope to get into a Masters of CS program

I mostly use my desktop with an i5-2500k which still performs very well despite its age. I find it really hard to choose one but I finally went with basically the cheapest 14"" model with a 7th gen i5 (7200u). Moments after buying it I regretted it and cancelled the order because I feel like the extra $170 might not be worth it as its quite a significant sum of money to me. &gt;$700 laptops are out of the question. Tbh I wouldn't really need a laptop since we have 2 nice computer rooms with plenty of desktops, all with i7's and VS and such installed, but many people prefer to work in other locations when working on projects or in study groups.. It also does seem handy to have a laptop in certain classes. I'm just not sure how much value CPU speed has in this case. Thoughts?",1,0

I took AP Computer Science Principles last year (I got a +B and a 3 on the ap test). I somewhat enjoyed the class but I didn't love it (some kids who like computer science didn't enjoy it either)

I am kind of worried because I'm not the greatest at math, and I heard there is a lot of it in computer science. I'm pretty good at thinking logically but sometimes complex math messes me up. 

I'm trying to learn Python and see how I like it but how else can I see if Computer Science is for me? Is there a different degrees similar to computer science that involves less math?

Thank you! :)",19,6

A bit of background info: I've decided to go back to school to get an associates (my state recently made two year degrees free and financial reasons prevent me from pursuing a bachelor's right now). I'm pursuing a double major in computer networking and programming. Included in my degree will be the A+ and CCENT certs. I'll be taking the Network+ soon and feel confident I'll pass. I also plan to pursue the Security+ and CCNA certs. Also included in my degree is an internship (most likely in the IT department at a local hospital).

My goal is to work as a network administrator or something closely related to networking. Obviously, no matter what I'll need to earn many years of relevant work experience. But I'm worried just having an associates will hold me back from getting a decent job after graduating.",3,2
