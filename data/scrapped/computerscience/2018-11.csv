I spent a good amount of time - about 3 full days - to come up with an algorithm, passed all the unit tests given out in the assignment. 

The auto-grader that's used in grading just pushes an output log on my GitHub folder, and I get a single line of error :  CODE DID NOT FINISH IN REQUIRED TIME THRESHOLD.

I guess it's some infinite loop that I didn't consider.

I'm gonna go to the TA's office hours tomorrow, but I don't expect a correction to my grades because this professor has a ""no regrading policy."" The TA's run an auto-grader against the assignment.

My question is, do I really deserve a 0 for this assignment? 

I know that a program shouldn't return an infinite loop to be of any use, but I just feel like I'm getting zero credit for the effort I put in this assignment. I feel like the grader is telling me ""you didn't do your assignment"" or ""your code doesn't even compile""

I may not be very good at it, but I love programming and am always eager to study it. However, this course is seriously discouraging and demotivating me so much. I work on this course for 10-20 hours a week to just get mere error messages that makes my effort nothing.  If I don't get any credit for this assignment, I'll have no other choice but to drop the course because it will hurt my grades so much. 

Last week I had a similar issue. I passed all the unit tests given out in the assignment file, but got half of my points deducted for an assignment. The reason was that I wasn't using a ""trick"" that the professor hinted us in the assignment guide. I found out that I sort of twisted the ""trick"" but was able to get the same results. But the test that was used for grading was trying to see if I was using that trick. I went to the professor to talk about this, and all he says is ""too bad, you should've followed the instructions"". I think there are many ways to solving a problem, and I think assignments should assess whether you can come up with a solution to a problem, not whether you can follow every single ""trick"" the professor tells you. Plus, it's not that I was using a method out of nowhere - I derived it from what I learned through the lecture.

On the other hand, choose the Java internship, I would work for a small society with no references or information about, nothing found on the web, just their (not so working) web-sites and some linkedin articles. But it would mean growing my java skills, just what I desire.

So, I'm here to ask you some advice, maybe some experiences about switching from .net to java and vice versa. I was thinking, maybe I could choose .net and improving Java skills by myself, working maybe on some solo projects and create a git repo to put inside my cv.

I would like to hear from you who has either or both:
- BS CS Degree from a regionally accredited university online or not
- BS CS Degree from a CSU/ UC
- BA CIS Degree from CSU/UC/Regionally accredited


How was your experience after receiving your degree?
Is there employment advantages with which kind of degree?
Which route would you rather have taken?

Lastly, employers. Which would you hire and wouldnt? I understand experience triumphs level of Degree, but per say all the candidates have the same amount of experience and skill set, which one would you hire as a Soft Dev?

But i cant afford a 15inch mbp with a 4core cpu packed in it. 
I also wonder if those 2cores cpus in the new mba and 13inch mbp without touchbar are sufficient for my work at my school.
Bumping to 16gb of ram on a mbp is also too expensive for me..
I would prolly switch to a higher spec mbp when i finish my degree and get a job. I hope this laptop could handle my work at school and my first couple years of work maybe until an upgrade on mbp where 4cores cpu become more affordable for me. By that time this laptop could be my secondary laptop for daily use.

So, should i go for a new mba with 16gb of ram, a base model 13inch mbp or any other windows laptop?
I could go for a surface laptop2 with 16gb of ram. With the 4 core i5 and 16gb of ram i think ill be fine for my work. I just wonder if its worth going for a base model mbp and sacrifice some horsepower for a better experience on macos.

Might be a shot in the dark, but I figured I would ask.

I'm developing a website in PHP, and everything is working perfectly on localhost (I'm using WAMP). Pushed my code to GitHub (which is connected to my Heroku environment), and when I go visit the website on the Heroku domain, almost everything that relies on PHP is blank.

The weirdest part is that I'm still able to log in, with credentials that exist in my database. So I'm not led to believe that this is an issue with my database. What's also weird is that when I inspect my homepage (after logging in) there's no HTML for a large part of my page elements, even though the code loads just fine on localhost. The common factor with the HTML not loading, is that they're elements that interact with the PHP on some level; either entirely or for a small portion.

Now my background on computers from highschool has been pretty spotty, I took an IT Essentials class, loved the part with building computers and working with hardware, things kinda went south when it came to the networking and security part of the class and I really struggled. 

I took a class on web development and learned a bit of your basic HTML, CSS, even a little Java and so on. 

Computers have always been something that have made me a bit giddy inside and I love watching videos over them, I myself have just never had the confidence to try and go through with it as a potential career to study for. But after experiencing the nightmare that is manufacturing, I'd say I'm ready. 

But the one thing I was good at and really really understood and enjoyed was the hardware aspect, I can easily talk and compare specs on computers, understand the in and outs of how they work and so on and would even say I'd be confident enough to know how to trouble shoot hardware issues and could easily be taught to repair it. 

So my big question is, if I'm really wanting to focus on computer hardware and computer repair and such, where would I look and where would I start? 

Luckily I'm 19 so I'm not too young to be going through my career change from manufacturing to computers. 

Any help coming my way would be appreciated and I'm looking forward to advice from everyone.

I have the passion and motivation to improve. I know I do. However, I lack experience as a computer scientist, and I also don't know what concepts will be taught in university (so I don't know what to study/improve).

I have experience in robotics competitions, and game development. I think I have a decent resume already.

Though a junior in a New York City high school, I can make a meaningful contribution to any team I join with my coding skills, passionate engagement, and work ethic. I have extensive self-taught abilities in scripted and object-oriented languages, computer vision and pattern recognition, CAD and 3D printing, robotics and mechatronics design, assembly and testing (Arduino, Rasberry Pi), etc.

I have gained problem-solving and presentation experience through a range of project challenges, including my own startup: a patented, prize-winning, low-cost 3D printed prosthetic hand.

The internship experience will afford me an industry overview and a practical deep-dive. I hope to use the experience and insights gained in directing my college plans to study computer science and engineering. I would also like to develop industry contacts with companies in order to begin my career in the field of computer science early.

I have attached my resume and would appreciate any opportunities. Thanks.

I started my CS degree at University around 2 months ago and it's going okayish, although slightly declining. I'm not entirely sure how to structure this post or if this is even the right sub (although it is Computer Science related), but I've recently been having a bit of a hard time. I had a semi-breakdown at the start of last week thinking that I was too dumb for the course (and I still do) and thought of dropping out but it got better as the week went on.

My main issue is that I just don't understand stuff/know how to do things, which ends up with me spending a ton of time on something small and making very little to no progress on it. Take today for example, I spent ~6 hours trying to create a Fibonacci Sequence program in ARM Assembly, and I basically got nowhere with it and only ended up making myself a lot more stressed because of it, similarly, last week on Sunday as well, I spent a similiar amount of time trying to create an ALU, which I also made very little progress in. 

I did expect it to be much harder than anything i've done before, but I wasn't really expecting this. I'm currently studying 4 different modules, and while I'm fine with 2 of them, the other two are linked with each other (one is to do with logic gates and creating them using other logic gates and stuff like the ALU) and another is ARM Assembly programming, both of which I don't like, don't understand and i'm pretty sure they'll be useless to me in terms of my future.

Have any of you current/ex CS students got any tips for me on what I could do? I don't feel like my issue is time but more understanding. I have quite a lot of time to do it all, but having a ton of time is useless when I don't know how to do something in the first place.",0,1

I understand the point and purpose of a logistic regression model.

For example, you would determine based off of salary and age (x1, x2) to determine if a customer bought a car (0 or 1).

My question is whether or not there is a way to use more than just 2 predictor variables to determine an outcome. For example use salary, age, gender, and address (x1, x2, x3, x4) to predict whether they bought the car or not.

I didnt care about my life unfortunately, I was very depressed. I grew up with an addict mother and then in a toxic foster home. I just didnt care about school during this, and spent my childhood/teenage years hooked on video games since they were my escape and my true joy. I loved console and PC games, and computers in general. But when I became 17 I got super depressed and anxious and just stopped going to school. Nobody was making me go, nobody cared if I went or not, so I was just making my own stupid decisions. And I got a boyfriend after I turned 18 and eventually became pregnant... I know you guys probably think Im just full of bad choices. But after having my son, my perspective on life really changed. I spent this time being a stay at home, his dad has a good job and has been supportive, and I sell my artwork and make commissions to pay for my bills. (find my art page on instagram if youre interested in seeing some of it! @danisartwork) lol. But now I realize I SERIOUSLY need to start working towards a career. I shouldnt have been so stupid in high school and not care about it. 
After a long time thinking about careers, I found that I really want to earn a degree in computer science. But I am so behind of course :( I would need to upgrade my college level courses from high school into university courses, which would be 9 courses if I wanted to get into a university for computer science. 9 high school university level courses would probably take a long time, over a year maybe? Especially with trying to balance my mom life/working from home. But I mean I really want to get a degree in computer science, as I think its fascinating and interesting, and would open many doors to good job opportunities. I want to be a successful parent, and take my son places and support him. 
Theres also a possibility I could just a couple high school courses so I can get into a computer program in the college (not specifically computer science) that might be able to bridge me into a university to take the actual CS. Not completely sure about that, but I have an appointment to meet with someone about this on Friday. 
But from where I am at now, what do you guys think I should do? Should I do those 9 high school courses and try to go straight into university? Should I try and just do a college program thats computer related (especially if it can bridge me to uni but idk if it can yet) or am I just too late and too behind for all of this. 
Oh and just to throw this out there in case anyone reading this is from southern Ontario, I live around Waterloo just so you know which schools are options for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  

**Introduction**

Consider a problem of **distributed matrix multiplication** performed on a set of CPUs. Given a pair of square matrices **A** and **B** you are asked to calculate matrix **C**

Am,mBm,m=Cm,m,whereA={ai,j},B={bi,j},C={ci,j}{""version"":""1.1"",""math"":""\\mathbf{A}\_{m,m} \\times \\mathbf{B}\_{m,m} = \\mathbf{C}\_{m,m},\\;\\mbox{where}\\quad \\mathbf{A} = \\{a\_{i,j}\\},\\;\\mathbf{B} = \\{b\_{i,j}\\},\\;\\mathbf{C} = \\{c\_{i,j}\\}""}

such that every element of matrix **C** is defined as 

ci,j=k=1mai,kbk,j{""version"":""1.1"",""math"":""c\_{i,j}=\\sum\_{k=1}\^{m}a\_{i,k} \\times b\_{k,j}""}

Each CPU is given (you need to develop your own row distribution algorithm) with a subset of rows of matrix **A** and the entire matrix **B**. It is responsible to calculate a subset of rows of matrix **C** which after being combined together with other partial sets calculated by other CPUs would form the entire matrix **C**. 

**Implementation details**

You need to develop an application with **command-line interface** (CLI) assuming to accept 2 command-line arguments: value of **M** (size of square matrices) and the number **N** of CPUs (user-level threads to be created). For example:

  java mmult 1000 10

where the first number is **M** and the second is **N**. Make sure to check that **M &gt;= N**. You can assume that **M % N = 0**. 

Use **random number generator** (RNG) to fill matrices **A** and **B** with values. Limit output values of the RNG by inclusive range **0..9**. Write generated matrix values into 2 separate text files, with each matrix row occupying a separate line, and column entries separated by whitespace(s). For example, the following shows content of a text file corresponding to a randomly generated matrix **A** of size **5 x 5**:

  2 4 0 3 1  
2 9 2      3   1  
6  1 2   6 3  
2 4   1 4 9  
0 0 1   2 3

Write resulting matrix **C** into a separate text file (so your application must create 3 text files in total) in the same format.

In case you work in Windows, you need to implement a simple profiling mechanism to **measure execution time**. The simplest profiler would retrieve and store current system time, [expressed in milliseconds](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis--) at the beginning of the execution and will do the same for the second time at the end of execution. The difference between two measurements is the program's execution time to be reported. If you work on Linux, you could utilize system tool called **time** in the following manner:

  time java mmult 1000 10

It would print a report similar to the following (different numbers... much bigger numbers):

  real 0m0.006s  
user 0m0.001s  
sys 0m0.004s

  

**Note:** The resulting matrix **C** should only be considered to represent the result of **A** and **B**multiplication when all threads have successfully completed their lifecycles. This assurance can be established in a number of ways, for example:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Call **join()** method      by the **main thread** off of all individual thread instances      in sequence. This technique will block the main thread every time      when **join()** method is called and will unblock it      when **join()** returns, which will happen upon completion of      the lifecycle of the corresponding thread instance. So calling **join()** for      every thread in sequence provides assurance that sequence completion is      equivalent to completion of all threads. 
2. Implement      a **barrier** object within the main thread (for example, by      means of built-in semaphore class) and share it to all worker threads. The      main thread will be expecting all threads to reach the barrier, before      this happens it will remain blocked. Every worker thread upon reaching      the barrier should modify it such that the main thread could be      automatically unblocked. **Hint**: Does it look like a clear case      of semaphore methodology application?

You need to implement the **second** option, i.e. the one with the **barrier,** to make sure that the main thread proceeds with saving resulting matrix to the file only when all worker threads have completed their work.

**Validation of the Result**

The three generated files, containing matrix data must be evaluated for the correctness of the result of matrix multiplication. One of the ways to do it is to use a software capable of multiplying matrices of arbitrary size. For example, you could use Octave, an open source alternative to Matlab. You can install it on any modern desktop OS including but not limited to Windows, Linux, Mac. Once installed, it will provide you with GUI or CLI where you could load matrix data saved in files and perform multiplication.   

For example, consider that result of your program execution is saved in 3 text files **a.txt**, **b.txt**, and **c.txt** in the format described above. You could check correctness of the result (fact that matrix **C** is the product of **A** times **B**) by using Octave as follows

octave:1&gt; load a.txt

octave:2&gt; load b.txt

octave:3&gt; load c.txt

octave:4&gt; c-a\*b

ans =

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

octave:5&gt; find(c-a\*b)  
 ans = \[\](0x1)

The all-zeros in the result of c-a\*b calculation proves that **C** is in fact equals to **A \* B**. 

**Submission**

Submit **all source files** required for compilation of your program along with a readme file containing all **necessary instructions** in a **single ZIP** archive named after your **last name**. 

You also need to submit a **report** (put it into same archive with source files and instructions) that includes the following sections:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Analysis      of the problem of distributed matrix multiplication from the standpoint of      application of the Amdahl's law. You need to estimate the proportion      of **pure-sequential**(I/O oriented) and **parallel-compatible**  (arithmetical      and logical)  operations. You may introduce a basic **OP** value      (length of abstract operation in time units) and express all other      operations as multiples of **OPs.** Knowing the proportion      you should be able to apply Amdahl's law to calculate the speedup factor      for different number of CPUs. Do your calculation for 1, 2, 4, and 12      CPUs. 
2. Measurements      of your program execution for matrix size of 4000x4000 on 1, 2, 4, and 12      CPUs. If your laptop/desktop computer doesn't have enough CPU/cores, you      can run the experiment on the LTSP server (in classroom 214).
3. Conclusions      that you render after comparing theoretical and practical results. **Hint**:      practical speedup factor is the ratio in execution times of 1-CPU and      many-CPUs scenario. You should have 3 values of speedup factor for 2, 4,      and 12 CPUs. ",2,1

Especially about ""Prior experience"" and ""Geek Gene"" from the students.

[Original paper PDF](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2016/icer_2016_bimodal.pdf)

Abstract: 

&gt;Although it has never been rigourously demonstrated, there is a common belief that CS grades are bimodal. We statisti-cally analyzed 778 distributions of final course grades from a large research university, and found only 5.8% of the dis-tributions passed tests of multimodality. We then devised a psychology experiment to understand why CS educators believe their grades to be bimodal. We showed 53 CS pro-fessors a series of histograms displaying ambiguous distri-butions and asked them to categorize the distributions. A random half of participants were primed to think about the fact that CS grades are commonly thought to be bimodal; these participants were more likely to label ambiguous dis-tributions as "" bimodal "" . Participants were also more likely to label distributions as bimodal if they believed that some students are innately predisposed to do better at CS. These results suggest that bimodal grades are instructional folklore in CS, caused by confirmation bias and instructor beliefs about their students.

From the Conclusion:

&gt;We theorized that the perception of bimodal grades in CS is a social defense. It is easier for the CS education community to believe that some students ""have it"" and others do not than it is for the community to come to terms with the shortfalls of our pedagogical approaches and assessment tools.  
&gt;  
&gt;A belief in the Geek Gene gives educators an easy way out from confronting these issues and being pushed to do better.

I have been working on this question.

Given a graph database D as a set of small graphs, the Apriori property of support means if a pattern is frequent in D, then all of its subgraphs are frequent. Consider a graph mining problem defined over a single graph G, where the support of a pattern P refers to the number of all the subgraphs in G that are isomorphic to P. Does the Apriori property still holds? If yes, give a proof. If not, give a counter example.

The questions core is whether the Apriori algorithm works in this case or not. In my opinion I see no reason why I shouldn't work, and despite my research have been unable to find a counter example.

Does the apriori algorithm hold up here? Or is this some exception I am unaware of?

Any help would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9wpc3c/im_not_sure_if_this_is_quite_the_right_subreddit/,noobto,1542118023,"**I had already been given the answer by the TA in class, but I don't understand it. I'm not asking for the answer on a homework problem or anything.**

The problem:

The Hamming distance (""distance"") of a word *w* to *v* of the same size is the number of positions wherein they differ. The distance between a *w* and L is the smallest such distance from a word chosen among L.

Let k be a natural number, and L a regular language. L' is the set of words w at a distance not greater than k from L. Show that L' is regular.

The way to go about this was to construct an automaton for such an L', and to do induction on *k*. If *k* = 0, then L' = L0 = L, and M0 = (Q0, E, delta0, q0, F0).

In general

&gt; Q is the set of states for an automaton accepting words with a distance at most k.

&gt; E is the alphabet among all machines and languages.

&gt; d is the tranisition function of Mk,

&gt; q0 is the start state for Mk

&gt; F is the set of final states for Mk.

The answer, according to the TA:

Assuming that the construction is valid for all i &lt;= k, we can form M' as follows:

* Q' = Q x {0, 1}, and **q'** is an element of Q'

* q0' = (q0, 0)

* d'((q, 0), a) = {(d(q, a), 0)} u {(d(q, b), 1) | *b* element of E}

* d'((q, 1), a) = {(d(q, a), 1)}

* F' = {q' = (q, t) | t = 0 or t = 1}
--------------------

I really don't get this. To me, it seems that if I start off with less than k+1 errors then I'll be in a state (q1, 0) for some q1, and if I read 1 error then I'm put in a state (q2, 1) for some q2. If I am in a state (q1, 1) for some q1 and read _anything_, then I'll be in a state (q2, 1) for some q2.

If I start with reading the first letter of any input, then I start in (q0, 0), and if I read one error then I'm in (q1, 1), and if I read 50 errors then I'm in (q, 1) for some q, but if we wanted **k** to be, say, 5, then I've surpassed that.

I'm really confused here. I'd appreciate any help.

But I'm considering signing up for an immersive coding bootcamp in the Washington, DC area and I'm a little overwhelmed. They're all so expensive (avg $10,000-$15,000 for 3-6 months), and they all seem to offer the same stuff. All the reviews say that they are great, and help land a lob once you've graduated. (places I've seen are GW University, the Flatiron School, Thinkful, General Assembly, The Coding Dojo, and a few others).

My question is has anyone does something like this? Will paying for a bootcamp like that be worth it or will I still be able to find a good job if I attend something cheaper and less formal? I honestly can't tell if most of these are ripping you off because they all have such amazing reviews. I am ready to work really hard at this and I loved the few coding classes I took in college, but of course I'm also concerned about wasting my time and money because the point is to get myself a decent job with the skills that I learn from this.

The content is given at a reasonable rate I am learning how to use Assembly.
However there is a problem with the instructor. 

Early in the class we did some maths using non-base 10 systems (mostly binary, SM, 1C, and 2C; all done by hand) and now that we're learning about floating point numbers we are learning how to turn base-10 numbers into floating point numbers (via paper and pencil). This is okay, however there lies a problem with this and the way the exams are structured. Each time an exam rolls around (we just had half of one today) it is in two sections: Programming and Theory. On each, we are expected to write a program (w/ pencil and paper) and do some work on the theory of MIPS assembly. 

However the issue is that on this ""Theory"" exam we only did maths on floating point numbers, base10 -&gt; base2 conversions, and a whole bunch of ""non-theory"" things. Basically, it was a math test. My impression of Theory on a Computer Science exam would be ""Here is some code. Explain what is inefficient about it and offer a solution with a short explanation of why you chose that solution."", not ""Here is eight problems on addition and multiplication of decimal numbers that you need to convert to base-2 FPS numbers and do math on, in only 50 minutes. Good luck!"" {the instructor claims he can do the same test as us in only 30 minutes}.

What have you all done in this position?

I started a CS degree two years ago, but quit because I felt overwhelmed and I had some personal issues that led to depression. So I went to study a mobile app development course (I'm from Spain, so it's a 2-year kinda vocational training), so that I could get at least some qualification in programming and solve those personal issues, and then decide what to do - I'm currently at that moment.

I'm interested in many fields (physics, CS, chemistry), and I've always struggled on deciding which one to choose as my career path. So I'm scared I might never get focused in one thing or find that ""motivation"" that everyone tells me I should have when pursuing a particular career. 

I feel like, when I say I might wanna start a CS degree (for example), I gotta say ""because I'm interested in THIS particular thing"". 

I'm also scared about time - I don't know if it might be too late now to start studying a degree. I'm 22, and I know I'm still very young, but everyone makes it feel like the opposite (with arguments like if I finish when I'm, maybe, 27, I won't find any jobs).

So I wanted your opinion on this, if it's still not too late for me and, even if I still don't exactly know what I'd want to center my studies on, it's still a good idea to start a CS degree now.

Thank you very much in advance and hope you have an amazing day!",4,1

They turn random conversations into sexual ones for no reason. When I've gotten better grades than said guys in a class, they pin it down to the male teacher being sexist and feeling bad for me.

I'm starting a new teaching business and was wondering what would be better to start? 

A Coding Bootcamp or a Computer Science bootcamp. I don't personally like the idea of coding bootcamp where you only learn to code but instead students should understand Computer Science in general with little bit of coding. I know that most people join bootcamps to get a job but would they be interested if it was for knowledge and not a job. I might be able to connect them to employers but would it work? What are your thoughts? Especially naming it Computer Science bootcamp instead of Coding bootcamp, would it attract people? or would it do the opposite?

Q is a finite set of internal states, 
 is a finite set of symbols called the input alphabet, 
 is a finite set of symbols called the tape alphabet, 
 is the transition function, 
[]   is a special symbol called blank, 
Q0  Q is the intitial state, 
F  Q is the set of final states. 

The Halting Problem is defined as follows: 
Given the description of a Turing machine M and an input w, does M, when started in initial configuration q0w perform a computation that eventually halts? (Linz 1990 page 317) 

Provability() is defined in the language of Turing_Machine_Descriptions: TMD 

M  TMD w  Finite_Strings()
Halts(M, w)  (TMD unify_with_occurs_check(M, w)  TMD halts(M, w))

The higher order logic predicate: Halts(M, w) is materially equivalent to the existence of a formal proof in the language of Turing Machine Descriptions:

// Test input pair (M, w) for valid input (see details below) 
from the q0w start state to the unify_with_occurs_check(M, w) state

// Then decide halting for input pair: (M, w)
then from the unify_with_occurs_check(M, w) state to the final halts(M, w) state

Implementing the functional equivalent of the Prolog predicate unify_with_occurs_check/2 in a halt decider enables halting to always be correctly decidable. Every input Turing machine description that would otherwise cause halting to be undecidable is rejected as malformed.

When fully appreciating this insight we realize that Rices Theorem would be refuted if the nontrivial property of halting decidability could always be correctly decided.

&amp;#x200B;

This semester's CS assingments have been getting tougher by the day and despite the fact that I start everything early, prioritize things, work in realistic and controlled periods , I still struggle. Don't get me wrong: So far I've managed to finish everything before deadline but the road hasn't been easy. Even when I put my hearth and soul into it, I can't possible finish any of the CS assignments without help from friend, TA or professor alike. Hell, the other day for an image filter I had to create an algorithm depending on the input to either do an NxN matrix of 1's or NxN matrix with 1's placed in a diamond shape (all zeroes outside the shape). It took me staggering three hours to do this one part of a bigger assignment when the median time for that was \~20min among my friends - these are guys who saw text editor the first time little over two months ago.  

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't seem to matter how hard I try, how I break the problem down to smaller components and  try different approaches&amp;analyze what has been asked, I still  - almost constantly - fail to see the pattern for general abstraction. And even when by dumb luck see the goal my way of implementing it is (objectively) so subpar it ashames me - my algorithms are so, so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Before you even say it, yes I know what imposter syndrome is. I'm going to call it out now and say that I'm less smart - have lower iq; inferior fluid intelligence bare minimum - than my friends. These are guys who didn't know any single thing about programming few months ago and now find so elegant solutions that TA's seem to learn more from them that the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I get by is because I can ask well articulated questions have good work ethics. That's it. That's the bag of tricks I have. Why I'm stressing/ranting this out is because for the past few weeks defeatism has loomed on my mind, and I have a pretty worisome picture that at best I'll be a person who has had his crystallized intelligence increased with all the algorithms I'm going to learn and nothing more.

Im a French student in physics and Im thinking about ending my studies to start others. To summarise I started in a preparatory classe to prepare the competitive exams of engineering schools. However it wasnt a success and I finally decided to join university in order to get a degree at the end of the year. Im currently in physics-mathematics at 3rd year but I hope to change next year. I dont like physics anymore and I dont see the professional potential and benefits of these studies. I dont enjoy working anymore and I dont see what job it can give to me.

I talked with many people and they have lot of different opinions about this because I enjoy a lot of things. However, one of my friend who study computer science recommended me to study computer science. He said that I would be good (because of my math skills and my logical thought), that its well paid and that my problem is probably the French system (he studies in England and think that the French system is catastrophic, which is kinda true). I also talked to a lot of people who said that its a good investment, and one said that he also left his physics studies for that. Thus I would really like to have information about the topic. Firstly you need to know that I just know python and algorithmic. I dont master other things, except some basis in C, bash and swift.

My first question is : what do you think about this situation ? Whats your personal opinion ? Can you share me your experience and thoughts ?

Then I want to know who should do that type of studies. Because I heard a lot about the topic. I know its cliche but many people like to say its very social and that youll not only do computer programming. However it seems very focused on that. I have an experience with a school one time and it was only programming day and night with other students. Thus not a cool atmosphere. Nevertheless it could be an exception because my friend seems to often work at home.

Finally I want to have details about these studies. I know itll depend on the country and school but all experience is good to take. How many hours of courses ? personal work ? Internship ? Besides, is it possible to pursue directly in a master after a physics degree ? My friend seems to say that its possible but I find this really weird. Moreover, how to apply in a foreign country ? Whats the best one ?

Thanks in advance for your help.",0,1

* Total program cost is around 85000 USD (Including living and insurance, tuition - 48000 USD)
* I am an international student and not so wealthy. I'll have to earn back this investment.
* Considering the H1B situation in the US, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to pursue now. I'd like to work in one of the top tech firms after graduating.
* Boston area will make it difficult to search for tech jobs right?

**My other option: Masters from Tu Kaiserslautern in Germany which is tuition free. Would this make my profile better compared to Northeastern? Do you think Northeastern's networking opportunities are worth it?**

With the German option, I would be able to complete my masters under 20k USD i.e. living expenses. I know absolutely no amount of German and would have to pick it up through the course to enable my self to be competitive enough for the Job market.

I plan to do a job after my Masters and would like to really understand if the US job market is rewarding enough to justify the 60-65k USD extra that I would have to shell out. I really want to love to see myself in a dream firm in the US but the low-cost education is highly lucrative at the same time.

I am looking at various PhD programs and am trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.  I completed my MSc in Computer Science with my thesis in Machine Learning / NLP.  It felt a bit ""too easy"" in that I applied existing techniques in new ways on new data to get improved results in a unique way.  I am sure it's a bit of imposter syndrome.

I really did enjoy my schooling and want to continue with my PhD. I am fortunate enough that my work provides me funding for continued education so if I continued with my studies it wouldn't cost me, would be a benefit to my career and would be self fulfilling. Note that I do not live in the US.

As I look into different programs I am looking at different fields of research and while I could continue with the NLP/ML area I was in I am curious what other serious subfields of CS there are with active research.  

I don't know what they are formally called but to give a bit of idea of work I like...

In some of my work I do a lot of data collection, cleaning, predicting, storing and then presenting. 

Data collection to me is a large part of my work where I am mass collecting data from websites with crawlers, with that I've developed a number of ways to be prevented by picking up by bots as well as have built distributed scrapers to encourage the high fidelity of my scraping. I've presented on the technical aspects of these are programming language conferences.

Web work is finding ways to make it easy for the users to deal with my data and results as they are usually not technically oriented.  I know software engineering is a massive CS sub-field, is Web Engineering a thing?  Like a Sub-sub-field of SE?

With modeling I do a lot of standard ML type prediction and classification modeling, nothing I find super exciting. Are there fields that deal with modeling of real world complex systems to try and find better solutions (e.g. traffic flow on roads)?

Thank you for your input - I know this is bit of a vague question since it's so big but these are a few areas of ""coding"" that I am involved in and enjoy and wonder if there's a way to dig into them from a research perspective.

it's so rhythmic it almost seems like something is polling once a second which causes my drops or something.

**it wasn't always like this.**  i've had this same machine for a while,  and ive reinstalled the OS many times.

\-But sometimes i think something gets flipped off or on,  and these drops start.  you can literally count the dips 

once per second.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to get about **120FPS** on some scenes,  and **60-80** in some of the more complex scenes.  I don't know if maybe something got flipped on my Nvidia profile,  but i've since tried refreshing the profile,  deleting it,  etc....,  so i'm not sure if it's that.  visibly it look like a stutter once per second.  on the FPS count you can see it dip all the way down,  and back up.  I turned on my SLI indicator,  and you can see the dip occuring in the SLI indicator.

When OSD my specs/statistics I can see that my GPU isn't even being used to the max.  maybe **30-50%** at the most,  and none of my six CPU CORES are even approaching 90%.  they tend to linger in that **50-70% range.**  It's like there's a grip of resources which aren't even being used by the game,  even in extremely complex scenes where FPS can drop well below 50FPS.  -But even in low FPS situations,  you can see the dips.

Not going to bother posing everything about my PC specs.  That doesn't quite matter considering the game **ran fine before,**  and just recently started doing this again.  It went away after a while since I previously formatted,  but it's back again,  and I have no idea what's causing it.  I'm starting to think the operating system is polling something.  Perhaps some speedstep crap,  performance counters,  or something that polls about once per second,  causing my FPS to dip.  -But if that was the case,  wouldn't I see it happening in every single game and video intensive app??

What are the best jobs and careers to get into for each degree i mentioned above?

I would really like to work in Hong Kong or Japan. Growing up with an aunt who married into the family and taught me bits and pieces about where she was from just really made me love that place. Its mostly for the schools, values, respect and most importantly the car scene that Id love to live there and eventually raise a family.

Im fascile in spanish and if i were to put effort into polishing it i would be fluent in it. (Grandparents are hispanic) and my japanese is very meh. Like preschool level haha. Again, not impossible to learn for me with application.

Now in terms of my IT, CS, and programming knowledge. Its basically zero from what i can say.

I build my own computers by putting the hardware together. I mean its not hard to youtube how to build a pc haha. Im a quick learner. Im more so computer literate to the point where if i have a teacher i wont have much issue learning the material.

Atm im an admin assistant/ clerk for an office making very meh money. I really want a career. And i want to live abroad if possible and it doesnt have to be right away.

Please, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss openly the methodology of how to properly be inclusive in our field. 

The ideology of inclusion when pertaining to career occupation should be seeing and rewarding talented individuals based on merit *regardless of age, race, gender, ethnic background, etc*. 

We need to move away from the existing definition of rewarding or meriting additionally exclusive opportunities individuals *because of being a woman or being a specific minority type*

In a relation database, you'd have different tables for posts and comments, for example, and would perform some kind of join (probably).

I've recently tried to learn a bit more about NoSQL databases, and it seems that performing joins is unwanted because it defeats the purpose of having these simple, scalable key value stores.

So how would you model such a system in a nosql key-value store such as DynamoDB? You wouldn't be able to have it all nested in one item, since it might exceed dynamo's limit of depth, etc.

Basically, TL;DR I really don't understand how NoSQL databases should be used properly. Any good articles that could help me understand this?

I took a computer science class last year and LOVED it (I got a 98%) so that's why I'd like to study it. I've been doing some research and found that I like Queen's, I'm interested uOttawa (since I'm French immersion) as well as Carleton.

Where I'm asking for advice is if anyone with similar marks went into computer science and enjoyed their time at university. Any recommended university programs or even suggestions if I should look into colleges would be much appreciated, as well as any other advice on the topic.

I'm from the London area so distance plays some part into where I'm applying.

&amp;#x200B;

SO HERE IS THE BRIEF 

&amp;#x200B;

Term 1 - Week 8/9:  
Functions  
The majority of assignments in the CS1PR16 module will be split over multiple weeks.  As  
such, each assignment will be split into multiple sections; you should aim to be completing  
one Session section per week.  
The two-hour lab sessions are intended for you to get help with the assignment and to be  
marked.  Try to get your work marked as you progress, rather than leaving it all to the  
very end.  
You will be marked within your assigned practical session.  Do not attempt to turn up to  
a different session for the marks, as you will be turned away (we cant cope with all 154  
of you turning up to the same session!  Thats why we have multiple sessions in the first  
place.)  
Ensure you are fully marked and signed off for the work you have completed each week.  
There will be a box to hand in your work in the lab.  
You must put the mark sheet in  
the box no later than the end of your assigned Week 9 practical on  
Monday  
26th November  
.  
It is your responsibility to keep your mark sheet safe until then.  
The  Alpha  Sting  is  an  extra  challenge  for  students  that  finish  quickly  or  want  extra  
practice.   It  is  worth  marks,  but  dont  worry  if  you  are  unable  to  complete  it.   It  is  
possible to pass the module without completing the Alpha Stings.  
Alpha Stings tend to offer less guidance than the rest of the practical; challenging your  
design and problem-solving skills in addition to pure programming.  
We encourage you to do the work in your own time as well.  
CS1PR16 2018/2019

Session 1: Simple Functions  
The  University  of  Wrighting  
would   like   a   new   online   Grade   Centre   for   student  
assignments.  
Each student will have a number of assignments that have been assessed, and need to be  
awarded a final grade.  There have been cases in the past where markers have awarded  
the wrong grade for a given marks, so  
UoW  
would like the system to compute a grade  
from the marks automatically.  
UoW  
will want to use your code in other parts of their new Grade Centre, so you will be  
given a comparatively strict specification to follow.  
Read the questions carefully  
\- our team of highly-paid consultants have told us that  
the specification as laid out should make later sections easier to do.  Furthermore, try to  
complete each question one-at-a-time:  it is better to have one mark for one answer, than  
no marks for two half-answers.  
You shouldnt need to write a huge amount of code for each question  
.  These  
are designed to be short functions that plug together.  The whole 2-week practical can be  
done in less than 100 lines-of-code (this isnt a challenge:  prefer longer code thats clear  
than shorter code you cant read) - if you find yourself writing a large amount of code on  
each question,  
ask a helper for advice  
.  
CS1PR16 2018/2019  
Page 2  


1    Computing Grades  
Grades at  
The University of Wrighting  
are awarded in a straightforward and standardised  
manner:  
Score (as percentage)  
Grade  
90 or higher  
A  
Less than 90, greater or equal to 70  
B  
Less than 70, greater or equal to 50  
C  
Less than 50, greater or equal to 30  
D  
Less than 30  
F  
A percentage may not necessarily be an integer - not every assignments available marks  
neatly divides by 100.  
Because  our  code  needs  to  be  reusable  (well  be  using  it  ourselves  throughout  the  
practical!), we are required to write a function to do this task.  
a)  
Write a function using the following prototype as a guide:  
char GradeFromPercentage(float percentage)  
  
Function must be called GradeFromPercentage  
  
Function must return a char (the grade, computed as described  
above)  
  
Function   must   accept   one   floating-point   parameter   (the  
percentage of the assignment)  
  
You are not required to perform any error checking on the input  
(it can be assumed that the percentage will never be greater  
than 100 or less than 0)  
  
In  your  main  function,  you  should  demonstrate  that  your  
function   correctly   computes   the   grade   from   a   user-input  
percentage.  
CS1PR16 2018/2019  
Page 3  


Assignments at  
UoW  
have some number of marks available - and not every assignment  
has the same number of available marks.  The marks a student obtains on an assignment  
are converted to a percentage by the following function:  
percentage  
= (  
marksAwarded/marksAvailable  
)  
  
100  
Because some lecturers have been known to calculate percentages incorrectly in the past,  
you are required to write a function that will compute the grade from an awarded mark  
and an available mark.  
b)  
Write a function using the following prototype as a guide:  
char GradeFromRawMarks(float marksAwarded, float  
marksAvailable)  
  
Function must be called GradeFromRawMarks  
  
Function must use the  
GradeFromPercentage  
function  
from part  
a  
.  
  
UoW  
may decide to change their grading boundaries in  
the future, and want as few places in the code to change  
those boundaries as possible.  
  
Function must accept two floating-point parameters  
  
The number of marks awarded  
  
The number of marks available  
  
You are not required to perform any error checking on the  
input (it can be assumed that the marks available will be  
greater than both 0 and the marks awarded)  
  
In your main function, you should demonstrate that your  
function correctly computes the grade from a user-input  
marks awarded and user-input marks available.  
(as an aside:  if the input parameters were integers, which would make sense with them  
being  discrete  marks,  you  would  need  to  perform  appropriate  casting  to  prevent  the  
percentage calculation from outputting 0.  Were using floats because were interested in  
how you write functions, not that you can cast correctly).  
CS1PR16 2018/2019  
Page 4  


2    Multiple Assignments  
Most  classes  at  
The University of Wrighting  
will  have  many  assignments  given  to  the  
student, and the students grade for the class is computed from the total of all assignments.  
One  class  in  particular  has  a  large  number  of  assignments,  so  your  code  will  need  to  
support  
up to  
100 assignments entered.  Most classes do not have nearly this many, and  
the lecturers do not want to add dozens of empty marks.  
UoW  
has specified that their lecturers do not want to count how many assignments they  
have issued for the class, and would instead prefer that the system prompts them after  
entering each assignment whether or not they are finished.  
c)  
Write a function using the following prototype as a guide:  
char GradeFromTotalRawMarks(float marksAwarded\[\],  
float marksAvailable\[\], int maxAssignments)  
  
Function must be called GradeFromTotalRawMarks  
  
Function must use the  
GradeFromRawMarks  
function  
from part  
b  
.  
  
Function will return a char representing the grade.  
  
Function must accept two floating-point array parameters,  
and an integer parameter  
  
The number of marks awarded on each assignment  
  
The number of marks available on each assignment  
  
The total number of assignments being passed to the  
function  
  
You are not required to perform any error checking on the  
input.  
  
In your main function:  
  
Allow the user to enter up to 100 pairs of marks awarded  
to marks available.  
  
After entering each pair, ask the user if they are finished  
by means of entering y for yes or n for no.  
  
The program should display the total overall grade after  
the user has finished entering marks, or after 100  
assignments have been entered.  
CS1PR16 2018/2019  
Page 5  


3    Improving User Input  
Some  lecturers  at  
UoW  
struggle  using  computers,  and  often  dont  realise  if  the  Caps  
Lock key is pressed or not.  
UoW  
would like all future input to their new Grade Centre to be indifferent to whether  
an input is in CAPITALS or not.  
d)  
Write a function using the following prototype as a guide:  
int CaseCheck(char a, char b)  
  
Function must be called CaseCheck  
  
Function must accept two character parameters  
  
Function will return 1 if both characters are alphabet  
characters, and are the same ignoring case.  
  
Function will return 0 in all other conditions.  
  
Your function will need to handle any valid ASCII character  
being entered.  
  
In your main function, you should modify your earlier code  
that asks the user to enter y or n to use this function (and  
implicitly also accept Y and N as valid responses).  
Your  
Hints, Tips and Tutorials  
sheet on Blackboard will give you a hint to solve this  
problem.  It should not be a long function to write.  If you are writing a lot of code, ask a  
helper for advice.  
4    Comments  
You will need to use these functions again next week.  Its a good idea to leave yourself  
comments describing what a piece of code is trying to do in case you need to update it.  
e)  
Ensure your code is commented appropriately

Here are some more details: A Turing machine H halt decider attempts to build a formal mathematical proof from its inputs to its own final states of H.halts and H.loops. If it finds that no such proof exists, then it has decided halting undecidability and rejects its inputs as erroneous, otherwise one of the two proofs that it built has decided halting on these inputs. 

Pages 318-319 from An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata (1990) by Peter Linz show the definition of the two Turing machines that are being analyzed: The top of page 320 show that  is being used self-referentially. [http://liarparadox.org/Peter\_Linz\_HP.pdf](http://liarparadox.org/Peter_Linz_HP.pdf)

This paper begins its first two pages with a slight adaptation of the notational conventions of Linz. It labels the second q0 state in  as .qx. It includes non final state of .qy. It numbers each copy of the input Turing machine descriptions.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323384939\_Halting\_Problem\_Proof\_from\_Finite\_Strings\_to\_Final\_States](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323384939_Halting_Problem_Proof_from_Finite_Strings_to_Final_States)

These adaptations to the Linz notation make it possible to perform a hypothetical execution trace of H(, ). 

This execution trace shows that no formal proof exists from H (, ) to final states H.halts or H.loops. No proof exists because the input pair (, ) specifies infinite recursion long before it reaches its paradoxical states of (qy) or ((qn)). 

The key to answering the original question is verifying this execution trace shown at the top of page three. This is the specific measure of whether or not a halting decidability decider could possibly exist. If this infinite recursion could be detected and rejected then a halting decidability decider does exist at least for H with inputs (, ).

I'm a third year Comp-Eng student and at this point I've done 2 group projects. In my particular school, there are a lot of east Indian students and apart from the annoyances of them being loud all the time and me assuming it was just a cultural thing, I didn't think much of them. But now that I have dealt (yes dealt) with them for the second time I am finding myself getting extremely irritated by their constant desire to cheat, create extremely sloppy code and try to manipulate me when I confront them on it. I knew they cheated a lot and it's not just an an Indian thing but man it's absurd actually working with them and having to constantly confront them about it. My girlfriend is studying commerce and when I told her about this she said it was the exact same thing with her program.

Now everyone says that work is not the same as school but I understand that as the ""work"" is not the same. 

This will probably offend a lot of people but I've gotten to the point where it has to be said and asked. 

I don't want to work with Indians who are ""FOB"". I wanna know if I have to deal with this type of nonsense only while I am in school or am I gonna have to deal with this shit once I enter the workforce?

About 2 years ago I recieved an SMS from a german number that seemed to be mistakenly sent to me. It is seemingly just a thank you-message, in german, for a present and is signed with a name at the bottom. I didn't do anything about it. Last year the number called but I did not pickup. This summer, the number called my phone again and left a message which is completely silent and only lasts for 2 seconds.  


Initially I thought that I should just text this person that they have the wrong number as it seemed they were really trying to reach someone, but some minutes after this call I got a message from the same number saying ""Hallo"" on Whatsapp. What made me hesitate was that the Whatsapp photo of this number was a very strange, super-zoomed in picture of a building. Then, the next day, it was a plant. Then, another day after, it was a cat. And ever until this day, the photo changes *every* day and is always something random like landscape, flowers, super-zoomed in patterns, tiles etc.   


This is really weird and doesn't really matter as I am going to block the number, but I'm so curious about the Whatsapp-thing as I can't see any other thing happening then it being some sort of automated picture change every day. The messages I have been sent, however, I don't think are automatic and seem more like a human has written them.

As in it never compiled , so I went home and decided to run it on my desktop ( 16 gigs ram, 8 core i9 9900K, 2xGTI1080Ti in SLI) so surely it wouldnt be a processing problem. The thing is, it still took such a long time, and was using 15% CPU and 30% RAM according to task manager! Whats going on that makes it so inefficient? Or whats the mistake here? I took a look at the both summations and they are rather long, but the program seems to take forever at the integrate function. Any advice ?

Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I must say I'm quite confused with whats going on. Initially, I wrote this program on my MacBook pro. When running, it would just stay running. Initially i thought that maybe there was an infinite while loop, but after debugging, i realized this was not the case. I figured it was a computation power issue, so i went home and ran the program on my desktop (8-core I9, 2 x GTX1080Ti SLI,16 GB Ram). When running this short code, I was astonished that PyCharm was using 30% of my CPU and 25% of my RAM. Im not sure why this program is so inefficient? searching the error code online didn't yield anything. I received the error when i wrote the program in the Python Console so I could see step-by-step what was going on, and the code seems to run forever in the ""val = sp.integrate"" line. 

&amp;#x200B;

While Im here, I must also ask: Im calculating the sum squared error. Basically it involves taking the difference of two summations, squaring the result, and integrating. As you can see in the code, for my ""exact"" value I'm doing 1000 iterations, and for the approximate it just takes the values of 30,40,50,100. Increasing the 1000 number drastically increases the inefficiency of the program, but would also make the result more accurate. On paper, the sum should technically tend to infinity, but I'm not sure how to tell python the compute the exact summation. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as my programming skills go however, I havent changed much, at least not relative to other times when Ive self studied.

I am not sure as to how relevant getting an A in music theory or history would be to my career. 

In high school, I always found it amusing how students would say This will not matter 4 years from now, because it very much would when it came to apply to colleges. Now in college however, it seems like I find myself in this dilemma.

Should I settle for less in my classes and devote more time to CS, or should I continue to explore the range of academics? 

As a side note, it seems like this is a transition from a holistic approach that was needed in high school (grades, SAT, extracurriculars, etc), and into what is now specialization (and more specialization within the field itself).

Thus, my questions emerge from an economic standpoint, but evaluating the importance (socially, personally, etc) of other classes is equally important. 

Thus. You. You that are in the field. You that are in graduate school. You that are completing the college journey. You that have self-taught since you were first conceived. Share the wealth of knowledge.

Now that I am doing my MS, I noticed that several of my classes are graded on either very strict curves or strict cutoffs and I know of more than a handful of students who are having GPA's below our cutoff for good standing (3.0).

Is this common in grad school? Because I would have imagined this being common during the first two years in undergrad. Even the upper division CS courses I have taken in the past, like OS, were very challenging but they all lacked that sense of stress that came with being in a weedout class (My OS professor was quite generous with grading if you put in a good effort).

I'm a self taught programmer and I'm pretty interested in low level programming. I have a history in maintaining linux systems so the ideas of memory, cpu, network, in terms of performance we present for me. However I'm trying to piece together the details of what's really going on under the hood.

I've been learning how x86 assembly works at a high level. And I understand that the CPU works with a stack data structure in memory. There is a CPU register which holds the value of the top of the stack at any given time. I understand that said register works in coordination with a base register to keep an offset of the current items in the stack being processed. 

Where I'm getting confused however is when I look in my linux books I see examples of a linux processes's memory layout. This involves a text segment, data segment, BSS, and then a stack and a heap. This is confusing my perspective. 

Things I do not understand right now are:

Does each process in linux get its own stack? Does each process get its own heap? 

I do not see any mentions in x86 assembly videos on setting up the text segment, data segment, and BSS when does this occur? 

I think I'm a bit lost when it comes to the linux kernel starting to run a process. I imagine that the linux kernel itself is calling assembly to setup the main() function of a c program. But if someone could walk through what actually happens in details when the shell executes a binary that would be HUGELY helpful. ",3,1

So as the title says, I'm in the middle of making some drastic changes in my life and could use some direction.

Some background: I received my BA in Psychology in 2016 and have been working as a research coordinator at Vandy the past two years. Unfortunately, I've come to realize over the years that I'm not very passionate about this work and am no longer interested in continuing it. This is mostly because I wasn't very passionate to begin with, but I was also pressured by family/professors to work towards my Ph.D. as this was ""the next step."" I was never doing it for myself. Just for other people and what they thought I should do. 

So, that got me thinking about what else I could do/what I'm good at, and I started thinking about computer science. I've always been good at math and am fairly handy with computers. A lot of what I did during my studies/at my job was data analysis: Working with analytical software, Excel, learning basics of a programming language to assist with analyses (used R, but not sure how much use that has outside of academia/research). I'm a very practical person as well and enjoy problem solving; the most exciting times of my job is messing around with the code/debugging to spit out the right outputs, and it's always so rewarding. I know those skills probably aren't much right now, but I think I could really excel in this field if I had the right background/training.

My hesitation comes with how vast the field is. Between programming/software developing/IT/security etc., I'm not even close to knowing what I would like best or what would be the best way to figure that out. Should I go back to school and get a bachelor's in computer science? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like that could give me a good foundation since I really have none. I also know there are tons of online resources (like edX, udacity) that I can take a intro computer science course or even learn programming languages that way. It's just all a little daunting right now going into this blind and could need a little push in the direction. :)

I've seen multiple proofs, and all of them seem to hinge on theoretical turing machines that output their result by printing that many 1s, and since the busy beaver function concerns the number of 1s that can be written, this is often a vital method in the proof. But what's stoping our hypothetical turing machine outputting its result in a different manner, for instance binary?

I'm convinced that a turing machine that takes n as input and prints (n) cannot exist, but I don't see why that means (n) isn't computable using some other output format.",3,1

I am trying to make my program uses the unordered arraylist implementation of the MyHashedMap class that implements the MyMap to find the word that has the most homophones.

 A homophone is one of two or more words that are pronounced alike but are different in meaning or spelling; for example, the words two"", too"", and to"".  

On The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, there is a link that has cmudict.0.7a.txt"" on it. It has the input of the file like this

""CLOSE-QUOTE  K L OW1 Z K W OW1 T 

""DOUBLE-QUOTE  D AH1 B AH0 L K W OW1 T 

...

 }RIGHT-BRACE  R AY1 T B R EY1 S 

As The page also contains a detailed description of the pronunciation dictionary. The file consists of lines of the form  ABUNDANT AH0 B AH1 N D AH0 N T  The first string is the word, which is followed by one or more phonemes (or phones) that describe the pronunciation of the word. There are 39 phonemes occurring in North American English that are used in the dictionary. The collection of 39 symbols is known as the Arpabet, for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which developed it in the 1970's in connection with research on speech understanding.  I called my program MostHomophones. 

The output is a first line should contain a single integer n, which is the largest number of homophones. The n homophones follow on the next n lines, one word per line. 

Considering only the MyHashedMap operations insert, remove, and find, give the worst-case total running time and a sequence of n operations that have that running time if MyHashedMap is implemented as: 

 (1) an unordered array list; 

(2) an unordered linked list;

 (3) an ordered array list.

In this fourth video I build on the prior three videos to finish building an arithmetic logic unit, then tying it together with six registers: an accumulator, a flags register, and four general purpose registers.

In the video I then show how to make three-state gates (which can drive a data bus), how to handle timing issues so we signal a register to read after a result is written to the bus, and how to build an accumulator that can read and write at the same time.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback.

Therefore, if one wants to earn 80kUSD as self employed, then he needs to generate 160kUSD at least. But to generate 160kUSD, I suspect there must be some strong value created for which I am very skeptic that only one developer could deliver in a reasonable time.

There are four different architectural design patterns that have been covered in this module:  


\-  Model-View-Controller (MVC) -  Separates presentation and interaction from the system data.  


\-  Layered architecture pattern -  Organizes the system into layers with related functionality associated with each layer.   


\-  Repository architecture pattern -  All data in a system is managed in a central repository that is accessible to all system components.  Components do not interact directly.  


\-  Client-server architecture -  The functionality of the system is organized into services, with each service delivered from a separate server. Clients are users of these services and access servers to make use of them.   


&amp;#x200B;

I been provided with the pre-release (case study) for the exam, but I am unsure what Architectural Design Pattern is most applicable. 

MVC is used when there are multiple ways to view and interact with data, so I don't think this pattern would be suitable. The layered architecture requires a UI/presentation layer, and therefore this pattern is not appropriate.  
I think that the client-server architecture model would be most suitable as servers can be distributed and general functionality (such as printing service) could be available to all clients and does not need to be implemented by all services.  
Of the four aforementioned architectural design patterns, which is the most suitable in this scenario? Thanks!

The University of \[retracted\] is an independent, not-for-profit university, with a student population of just over 10000 and over 1000 members of full-time equivalent staff spread across five schools of study. In order to effectively manage the day-today activities of the Universitys growing population of students and staff (academic and non-academic), it plans to issue a multifunctional ID card system, UID card, to all its students and staff.  

Primary aims of the UID card is to provide a secure and a convenient way to gain access to university buildings and rooms, use resources/services such as printers, photocopy machines and library books, and make payments for purchases from the university refectory. Long-term aims of the system are to monitor student attendance and usage of computer rooms, printers, photocopies and library books. 

The UID card should include the university name and logo, cardholders name, ID and photo. In the case of students, the card should include an expiry date, which is the expected date of completion of their study. 

A cardholder should be able to present their UID card to a card reader attached to the door in order to gain access to a building/room. A valid card should result in the door being unlocked. All staff and students can enter all university buildings. However, access to computer rooms are restricted to staff in the Computing department and those students enrolled in a computing degree programme. 

A cardholder can use printing and photocopying facilities using the UID card by presenting the card to a reader attached to the printer/photocopier. Whilst academics have no limits on the number of pages they can print, students are allocated a print quota based on their programme of study (e.g., 250 pages for an undergraduate, 400 pages for a postgraduate).  

Due to the scale, complexity, infrastructure requirements and costs involved in this project, the university has decided to deploy the UID card system in a number of stages. Their priority is access control to buildings and rooms. This stage will be jointly managed by the IT Services and Buildings &amp; Maintenance department, and has to be in place before the July 2019 intake of students. It is expected that the UID card system should utilise the existing student record system managed by the Registry.  

The use of UID card to access printers and photocopy machines will be rolled out in the second stage, which should be completed by September 2014. The system should produce termly reports of printing and photocopier usage. Facilities to use the UID card to make payments at the refectory should be in place before the January 2015 intake of students. This stage will be led by the IT Services and the Catering department. The university has decided to give all students 10 worth of credit on their UID card when they register at the university. Students can top-up their UID card up to a total credit value of 50 using cash at designated points. In future, a user-friendly online top-up facility is to be provided to enable students and their parents to add credit to a UID card using a recognised credit or debit cards. 

When the system is in place, the registry should be able to view attendance records of individual students, individual modules and schools. The system should trigger an alarm if a student has missed four lectures.

I consider myself a self-taught programmer even though I attended one year of online programming course in one school. I learned more on my own then there (that for my main languages, aside subjects/languages are taught well). Anyway, I dont want to be a programmer who just knows to type code and thats it. 

I wanna know how computers work, why do they do something. I wanna know how to use my tool (computer) and also to know my tool (computer).

I finished Telecommunications department on my college, but programming is what I love, thats what I found in 3rd year of college, since then, I started learning on my own, watching videos about programming, finding books, web articles...

Some of you reading may now what I need, for some my question is maybe too broad or general, but basically:

* I want to know how computers work
* When I write program what are the steps of compiling, what happens when program is executed etc etc...
* Little bit of history of computers

**I just wanna learn what a person who works with computers needs and must to know.**

I will gladly accept your suggestions, sources for learning, videos, books, anything really.

Thank You for taking your time to read my post! :)
