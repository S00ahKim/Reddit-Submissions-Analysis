But for some reason, I'm scared. And somehow, I feel lost in what I'm doing, despite all I have accomplished. I'm taking my first CS class in the fall, and what scares me the most is that I will not like it, especially because the horror stories have gotten to me.

I've currently taken an intro CS class and data structures. I'm starting into systems now. I am proficient in C, C++, and Python.

I was wondering, what's the best way to get started learning this stuff on my own?

I'd like to work from the ground up, so I can actually see what's going into all of this.

I understand youre suppose to pick a language based on what you want to do and the demand where you live. The problem is Im not really sure what type of route I want to take in my future.

But anyways I know that  the path of CS can take you to a lot of different career options. I know that I love technology and computers and I'm really thinking of switching basically to CS. My questions is, is it worth getting a masters degree on CS or are there alternatives routes that can take you to a technology and computer wise careers?

next week I'm going to give my class a short presentation about the halting problem; therefore I have been doing some research about the argument,.and inevitably I didn't understand some things.

I didn't get much into the formal syntax and symbols since I neither want, nor need, to be much specific about it.

So, down to my question, how did Turing answered the decision problem demonstrating the halting problem? From what I understood, the decision problem asks if exists a program that tells us if a given statement statement is true or false. Then, how can solving the halting problem, that to me seems a specific instance of the decision problem, solve the decision problem?

* All jump instructions into the basic block must target the first instruction in the block
* Only the last instruction of the block may be a jump instruction

In some research I'm doing I am using a generalized notion where a suitably modified version of the the above properties hold but where we may have multiple blocks (the configuration must be loop-free but may branch--this may need to be tweaked a bit since a basic block can itself be a loop). Are there any standard notions similar to this?

To be explicit, I am currently defining a generalized basic block the triple `(Blocks, head, tail)` where `Blocks` is a (possibly loop-free) set of basic blocks, and `head` and `tail` are elements of `Blocks`, satisfying:

* Any outside block with a jump targeting a generalized block may only target the head of the node, and
* The only block in a generalized block that may jump outside of the generalized block must be the tail",0,3,False,self,,,,,

Which is the smarter route to go?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8poquw/compsci_ba_vs_compsci_bs_earlier_graduation_and/,lockpickingMyDreams,1528501552,"I already know that most employers don't really care if you have a BS or BA, just if you can do the job or not. My question is about the specific classes in each degree. Part of me would like to work on AI like smart assistants because I find it very interesting so maybe the BS would be worth it, but maybe I don't need all the extra classes to land an AI position. But then the other part of me says just get the BA and a less technical job that still pays well, and do entrepreneurial stuff with that money like I've always wanted. For example working as a web developer, I think I'd enjoy that.

I'll be done with my core classes after next semester so I have to make a decision about which road to pick soon. Here's a table comparing the required classes in each degree program that I haven't taken yet

##CS Classes

| BA | -----  | BS
| ----- | ----- | -----|
| Intro to OOP || Intro to OOP
| Discrete Math|| Discrete Math
| Intro to Data Structures|| Intro to Data Structures
| Machine Programming|| Machine Programming
| Compilers and Automata|| Compilers and Automata
| Software Dev|| Software Dev
| Computing Ethics || Computing Ethics
| Senior Project || Senior Project
| Database Management || Data Structures and Algorithms
| CS elective || Programming Language Structure
| CS elective || Architectural Concepts
| CS elective || Operating Systems
| CS elective || CS elective
||| CS elective

##Non CS Classes

| BA | -----  | BS
| ----- | ----- | -----|
| Choice of Calc 1, Technical Calc 1, or Calc 1 for Business students | | Calc 1
||| Calc 2
| Choice of Stats class with prereqs. as low as College Algebra | | Choice of upper division Stats class, all with Calc 2 or 3 prerequisites
||| Intro to Linear Algebra with Calc 2 prereq.
||| Choice of upper division Math class, all with Calc 2 prereq. or higher
||| Physical Science with lab
||| Physical Science with lab


As you can see there are more credits to do in the BS as it requires more total credits, and on top of that less of my transfer credit applies to it, so I could graduate about a semester and a half earlier if I did the BA. There's also a lot more math which makes me wary as I've already failed Calc 1 in the past and withdrew from it once too. Many people say that Calc 2 is the most difficult math class next to Diff Eq. which isn't encouraging either. Another thing is, if I do fail a math class and don't pass 15 credits that semester, my scholarship will fall through.

The only thing that really appeals to me about the BS is the Linear Algebra class which is used heavily in AI according to my reading. Is that something I could learn on my own or on the job or would I really need a fundamental understanding of Calc 2 first?

I'd also like to point out with the BA electives, I can choose any of the CS classes on the BS side.

Another thing, is it unlikely for a fresh grad to land an AI job right out of school? Aren't those jobs usually a more senior position for people with a lot of experience? Maybe I shouldn't even be worrying about that for a few years, at which point the math classes I took in college wouldn't really matter all that much.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

**Question**

*Udp is a ""light"" transport layer protocol with a minimalist service. Nonetheless, when an application uses this protocol:*

*a) The application could have delays, that's the reason TCP is used in real time applications

b) The application can by herself implement services that would be implemented by a transport layer, but that aren't offered by UDP

c) The application can have flow control, given that the receptor can always announce its receiving capacity

I'm in a computer class at a regular University.

There's this girl in my class that sits next to me and every lab she will ask to take a picture of the other guy sitting next to her's completed code. He always agrees, which I don't understand why, and she just 'copy pastes' it and turns it in as if she did it on her own.

This has happened almost every lab, and it's really rubbing me the wrong way.

She even went as far as to get his number so she could copy a project coming up from him which I thought was a rather difficult project and spent quite a bit of hours on.

I have a question about the process of getting an internship.
I took a more non-traditional path, was never very organized and had a poor academic past. I Turned things around later in life by switching degrees and following my interests. I've been doing well and will be getting a Bs in CS soon. 

Now that I am close to finishing. I want to get an internship but I'm someone who didn't much guidance about academic life and or the finer points of getting ahead. I am most concerned about not doing things in the right time frame. How do yo figure out when to apply, are there deadlines and schedules similar to a school semester? Is there an optimal time?

I really want to get my foot in the door with an internship at a place that does things in engineering, rather than a startup where I might be doing web development. I know getting an internship at a place like NVIDIA or Sony or IBM is likely very competitive, but I just don't want to hurt my chances by getting simple things wrong like scheduling that have hurt me in the past.

I'm a computer science student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I'm in the summer in between Sophomore and Junior year. I am in quite a predicament because of my own mistakes, but I'm pretty determined to try and fix them. My university requires 5 math courses for a CS degree: Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Calculus 3, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. I had no High School credit for any math classes, so first semester of Freshman year I took Calculus 1. I left Calculus 1 with a C, having a lot of trouble with the final exam, but the curve saved me.

Next was Calculus 2, and so I took it the next semester. I didn't pay much attention in class and messed up on the exams, so I finished the class with a D. You need a C to take Calculus 3 at my school and so I was forced to retake the class. I ended up taking Calculus 2 twice more after my first failure (1st and 2nd semester of sophomore year). Both times I withdrew after 10 weeks because I had done so poorly. I started both semesters by paying attention, but when I got busy with other classes I did the my Calc homework just to get it over with, not to understand it, and ended up doing really poorly on the first 2 exams (the 3 exams of the semester made up 70 of my grade). I was really disappointed in myself and starting doubting my abilities as a student in math.

Fast forward to this summer, where I enrolled in the 8 week community college Calc 2 class so I could get the credit and move on. I believed that if I focused on Calc 2 and nothing else I would be able to do well, even if the class was twice the pace of my other Calc classes. I come to class on time, stay attentive, and stay after class for 4-5 hours to go through the homework.

What I found is that even though I'm devoting pretty much all my time to Calc 2, I'm still struggling. I have forgotten everything from Calc 1 because I took it over a year and a half ago, and my algebra was never strong to begin with. I take forever to do the problems, and even though I'm taking them slowly, I still make a ton of simple mistakes. I have this feeling like even though pouring all my time and effort into it, I won't succeed.

I am seriously dreading my first exam in 3 days, and its taking a toll on my mental health. Even when I'm not doing Calc, I'm constantly thinking about it and playing the moment where I know nothing on the exam in my head over and over. I'm also losing sleep from having nightmares from the exam and failing my parents again. My family is tight on money and this class cost me $700. I can drop it by tomorrow and still get my full refund back but that doesn't really solve my problem, it just puts an end to my constant fear and worrying. If I drop the class I fear I won't be able to graduate university on time.

I need some advice. Do I drop the class or just toughen through all my emotions and see if I can make it through the other end? Are there any alternatives to getting credit for this class? I don't know of any other options. If I could take an online class without a proctor where I have a lot of time to myself to work through the problems that may help. Thanks in advance for any responses at all, even if its just words of encouragement.

I could care less if you know 15 languages fluently. I hire for ATTITUDE and TRAIN for skills.

I don't care if you know 15 frameworks, if I am paying you 60k plus, you will do it my way. HOWEVER, if the attitude is there, and you are teeming full of confidence, I could be SWAYED to do it your way!

You are asking for peoples money, so you need to be prepared to back it up.

Just quick advice in case this actually gets traction: IF YOUR RESUME IS LONGER THAN ONE PAGE I WILL TRASH IT.

If I get over 20 resumes, I will link and rate them for you all so you can understand an INSIDERS point of view in regard to the hiring process.

TLDR: ONE PAGE RESUME (unless a federal application, or CS gig that needs a TSCI clearance), NO PARAGRAPHS (unless stated otherwise), NO MORE THAN 4 BULLETS PER JOB (unless less than 3 jobs), AND YOUR NAME BETTER BE THE BIGGEST THING ON THE PAGE (if you have experience, your education goes last.

Any ideas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8rrx8x/im_a_bit_torn_between_these_two_curricula_im/,noobto,1529250974,"Some background:

I have a bachelor's of science with a major in physics and a minor in mathematics. I have taken through Calc 4, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, ODE, and then Differential Geometry. GPA: 3.2

I have self-studied abstract algebra, a little bit of game theory, and some enumerative combinatorics.


I have turned over a new leaf, and have since decided that I want to get into artificial intelligence, and am going about it a very specific way. I don't want to go straight into one of the few Master's programs that may already accept me, and have been looking into getting a bachelor (""un licence"") from a French institution in CS, which is traditionally three years in length. There are two institutions that I have applied to, and have been accepted by one already (**A**), and am currently waiting to hear from the other (**B**) that I *should* be accepted by (when speaking with the international contact at that university). I have applied to the last year of the bachelor/licence (L3).

**A** accepted me into their mathematics/CS program. [Here](https://pastebin.com/Jz6Dxv2k) is their curriculum for the L3.

**B** is a better ranked school, and is in a city that I would much prefer to go to; however, their program is ""fundamental computer science"", and (their curriculum)[https://pastebin.com/HhSykpuF] is thus lacking in much mathematics.


Again, I've already accepted to **A** and am waiting to hear back from **B**, but I'm already in the window of when I should be accepting an offer and applying for a student visa. Either I accept **A**, or I wait a bit longer for **B** and, then just apply for **A** if there's still no acceptance. I am looking to go into artificial intelligence, and I'm not sure what exactly is required in going in. I've been looking at a few of the higher institutions across the globe for their AI master's requirements and curriculum. Some institutions don't really explicitly have any, and probably just then require a degree in computer science (**A** and **B**). I have found only one program thus far to explicitly mandate having taken Discrete Mathematics, so I'm wondering if there may be other requirements that I won't be taking at **B**. **A** would also give me the opportunity to retake the math courses I did and get a better GPA than what I had obtained my first time around.

I'm not sure of the extent to which Architecture and Operating Systems will be useful in artificial intelligence, but they are useful in general. Likewise, I'm not sure if I need to know so much about all of the types of algorithms on graphs/text/geometry for AI, but these are still things that surely won't hurt to know, although they will likely be covered to varying extents at **B**. Enumerative combinatorics, the course that is taught at **A** yet not at **B**, is surely something that I could study more in depth, or take an online course in (as well as any other course that I may lack), but I see that being offered as one of the required courses at another higher institution for their AI program, unlike OS and Architecture.

I guess I was just looking for which curriculum is better. I would much prefer **B** for many reasons (some non-academic), and was probably rationalizing my having only been accepted to **A**, and thought that it was the better option. After having written this out and thought about it, I once again think that **B** is better, but still, do you agree with that assessment (as far as for AI goes)?

I shouldn't expect to be accepted into top universities for their graduate programs, and am going to look at lesser institutions as well and see what their requirements may be, but if anything, I'd expect it to be looser.

But yeah, so thank you for having read all of this. Any ideas or advice? I'm going to write an email to **B** asking for a follow-up on my application, as there had been some issue in their acknowledge my ability to apply.",0,4,False,self,,,,,

I am currently attending school in the Midwest, Kansas/Missouri area as an International Student. This Summer, I'll be finishing my last semester at a community college and then transferring to a state school in the Fall. I graduated high school in Spring 2016, and have been taking general education courses at a community college. 

This summer I started my journey towards my CS degree. I am taking CS 200 aka Problem Solving and Programming 1 with C++. Other courses I have completed that might pertain to my degree are Engineering Physics 1-2, and Calculus 1-3. In the Fall, I am scheduled to take Programming 2, Linear Algebra, Discrete Structures 1, and 2 elective courses. Overall, I plan to finish my undergraduate degree in Fall 2020. 

I am mostly concerned about how I stand when compared to other students. Because I am technically transferring as a sophomore (2nd year college student), and I am just now taking my first CS class. Most other students start during their first year. Am I at a disadvantage? 

Second, is it impossible for international students (in engineering / CS) to get an internship, with the whole visa thing? If it would be hard for me to intern, what other options do I have in terms of being able to get the same professional experience? Is ""job shadowing"" a thing in engineering too? I ask about ""job shadowing"" / volunteering because I think that would be my next closest option but on engineering and CS subreddits, I often see people say to not do any work, intern work or real work, for free. What other options do I have because I'm scared of not being able to gain experience due to limitations with my visa. 

Follow up to my previous question: If I am able to do something like a ""job shadow"" for a day or spend a day at the company, who specifically do get in contact with to make it happen? 

It would also be really helpful if I could talk to someone or read someone's story who was or currently is an international student and going through the same situation as I am going through.

OK, this has bugged me forever. When I was young, before the age of DSL, I was one of the lucky fews to have an ISDN connection for my internet needs. It allowed me to connect nigh-instantly, and benefit from a whoopin' 64kbps symetrical connection, while all my friends were left with 56k down and 33k up.

The thing is, I never knew what exactly it was, in relation to POTS/PSTN and xDSL.

I mean, I've been told it's a ""digital line"", unlike POTS which is analogue and has to be modulated/demodulated (hence the MoDem). But DSL is digital too, and seems to be working in a vastly different way. Also, the ISDN required a ""special line"", but in the end, it's still just a pair of twisted copper wires, right?

So what makes ISDN different, at a technical level, from both PSTN and xDSL?

What are some cool activities I could plan, that can capture the interest of my members?

1. So, you always hear about guys like John Carmack developing games when he was 12 and similar people who just have an aptitude for programming. I wonder if programming is something you just either have or don't have, and I don't want to just jump into school for something I might not have. I am working on The Odin Project right now, and have taken a few codeacademy courses, and I seemed to take to them pretty well, but I'm worried that I'm going to come across things later that I just won't be able to understand.
2.  In high school, I was actually rather good at math and was able to grasp mathematical concepts well, but I never paid attention. I know there is a lot of math involved, and I'm not sure what mathematical level I should be at before even starting the coursework. I plan to meet with a guidance counselor this week, but I also wanted to get you guys' opinion on this. I remember very little math beyond the basics. I could learn it and am able to learn, I just have no idea what I should know before starting, or if that will be covered in my basics, etc.

I'll be going into my fourth year of computer science, half of which is dedicated to my master's project. I have spoken to a few lecturers about what type of things I could do and have shortlisted to two projects/project area, and I cannot pick between the two. 

**Project 1 - Streaming matching algorithms project.**

Without going into too much detail about what this project is, it's an algorithms based project where I will be given two algorithms that I will have to implement and analyse. Specifically, I will have to run them on a simple graph and compare things such as accuracy, complexities and actual runtime, and discuss them in my thesis. As this project is already set, I will probably not be able to change it too much, other than extensions at the end.

**Pros**

* The project is already well thought out and planned by the supervisor, so there will less decision making on my part, at least initially. 
* I did quite well in the Advanced Algorithms module.
* The supervisor is very specifically working in this area, and its a project that I feel he'll be able to help me in quite well if I get stuck. 
* The two algorithms are based on techniques I have learnt before, so I will be able to quite easily refresh them over summer.

**Cons**

* I feel like exams are quite luck based so I don't think I should over estimate my abilities based on the mark in the module, which only had one exam, especially since the supervisor claims this to be a difficult and heavily theoretical project. 
* Maths heavy (I am unconfident in my maths skills).
* May be more suited for people who would like to continue further studies and do a PhD, which I have no intention of doing.
* Supervisor is relatively new and I have never had him as a lecturer before.

**Project 2 - Deep learning in Biometrics**

This project technically isn't defined yet, so I'm not sure what exactly I'll be doing. The supervisor has given me some ideas as to what students have done previously, but I will probably have to think of a project myself. He specialises in nature based deep learning (e.g. identifying gorillas in extended video clips) and I would like stick to the same area, though I do have a lot of leeway.

**Pros**

* I quite like the supervisor. I've had him for many lectures and find him very enthusiastic and positive, which I feel would be nice since I stress out quite easily. He claims to meet his students once a week atleast to keep track of how they're doing.
* Deep learning is a popular topic in computer science, and one that I might find interesting (though I'm not sure of this yet).
* The supervisor has a variety of large data sets that I could work with.

**Cons**

* I would have to think of a project myself, and I feel like I can easily get bogged down in doing so. I don't quite get how ""diffiicult"" or unique master's projects need to be, and I wouldn't really know where to start. I feel like the open-endedness of this is a boon and a curse.
* I feel like a lot of stuff in deep learning has already been done so I'm worried I'd just be copying another master's project out there.
* Not sure how well I'd do as I have never studied a Deep learning module. I have done an introductory module for machine learning, and found it quite challenging. 

I understand that in the end it will be my choice to make, however I just would like to discuss this with people who have more experience than me and get a few reccomendations (or even possible alternatives).

I've just heard a few things about how its become so big now and I want to make sure that if I'm having a conversation with somebody I'll be able to give them accurate info.

So basically what I've heard is that AI algorithms require the need to be able to do a lot of the same work at one time. For example, when you do laundry, you wash and dry as much clothes as possible. You don't wash 1 shirt for 15 minutes, then dry it for another 50. Bascially you need highly parallel capability. So this means that hardware modeled after GPU's are the way to go. I've seen people say that Nvidia made the first GPU back in the late 90s, and that it was specifically designed for video games. Then all of a sudden, other people started to look at how those products from Nvidia were designed, and figured out that that is exactly what AI applications need.

But, I did a little googling and found out that there were already chips that were specifically made for gaming graphics. And also, if the development of GPU's in the late 90's was so instrumental, then how come we're just now getting heavy into AI? We should have already been getting into this stuff a while ago.

I am writing a program for an ARM SoC (AM335x, ARv7) and want to implement a ring buffer which is shared between two processors (PRU, CORTEX-A7)

One CPU writes, one CPU reads. Looking on wiki I see this guy..

volatile unsigned int produceCount = 0, consumeCount = 0;
TokenType sharedBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE];


void producer(void) {
	while (1) {
		while (produceCount - consumeCount == BUFFER_SIZE) {
			schedulerYield(); /* sharedBuffer is full */
		}
		/* Write to sharedBuffer _before_ incrementing produceCount */
		sharedBuffer[produceCount % BUFFER_SIZE] = produceToken();
		++produceCount;

void consumer(void) {
	while (1) {
		while (produceCount - consumeCount == 0) {
			schedulerYield(); /* sharedBuffer is empty */
		}
		consumeToken(&amp;sharedBuffer[consumeCount % BUFFER_SIZE]);
		++consumeCount;
	}
}


but it makes me feel real uneasy? I'm not too sure, but I have a feeling there could be a real chance that the increment operator could be split into two register writes, like for the case of say.. consumeCount == 0xFFFF_FFFF, when we come to increment this, how can be sure what instructions will happen? What if the compiler generates a 2 16bit load instructions instead of something that is a 32bit load instruction? we could have something like this, no?

t0, consumeCount == 0xFFFF_FFFF
t1, consumeCount == 0xFFFF_0000  
t1, consumeCount == 0x0000_0000  

if processor a processor reads consumeCount at t1, it will be hosed. I feel like we need a spinlock here to guard the tail and head pointer or use 16bit pointers so atomicity is inured? am I tripping? Is the wiki wrong? I don't feel like the code on wiki is exactly safe. Am I wrong?

If you're reading this, you're most likely interested in learning about quantum computing; however, you might not be sure how to get started because of a lack of people to work with, lack of direction, and maybe even a lack of a bit of background knowledge.

I've created a subreddit, /r/MikeAndIke, which will enable people with the desire to learn about quantum computing to come together and learn, generally directed (though not entirely restricted) by the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang (hence the name, Mike &amp; Ike).

I'm very new to reddit in general, and so I'm extremely new to running a subreddit. But, I hope that together we can make this a great learning experience for each other! Let me know if you have any questions or any other comments, feel free to spread the word to people you think may be interested, and I'll continue to look forward to your arrival! :D

If so, is this a new reduction and algorithm from 3 SAT to clique?  I could only find one SAT to clique reduction; it wasn't this.

**Definitions:**

A *clause group* of a SAT instance are clauses that contain the same variables.

For example:

(1 or 2 or 3) and (1 or -2 or -4) and (-1 or 2 or -4)

(1 or -2 or -4) belongs to same *clause group* as (-1 or 2 or -4). (1 or 2 or 3)  belongs to its own *clause group*.

The *complement* of a SAT instance is computed like this:

For each *clause group*:

* Compute all clauses in the *clause group*.
* Remove clauses that are present in the SAT instance.
* Negate the literals.

The result is treated as a disjunction of conjunctions.

For example: (1 or 2 or 3) and (1 or -2 or -3) and (-1 or 2 or -3) and (-1 or 2 or 3)

=&gt; (1 2 3) (1 -2 -3) (-1 -2 -3) (-1 2 3)

=&gt; (1 2 -3) (1 -2 3) (-1 -2 3) (-1 -2 -3)

=&gt; (-1 -2 3) (-1 2 -3) (1 2 -3) (1 2 3)

=&gt; (-1 and -2 and -3) or (-1 and 2 and -3) or (1 and 2 and -3) or (1 and 2 and 3)

The resulting SAT instance is a conjunction of disjunctions, one disjunction for each *clause group*.

Two disjunction clauses are *consistent* if they do not contradict one another.

For example:

These clauses are *consistent*: (1 and 2 and 3), (2 and 3 and -4)

These clauses are pairwise not *consistent*: (1 and 2 and 3), (1 and 2 and -3), (1 and -2 and 4)

**Reduction:**

Take a SAT instance. Each clause should contain distinct variables.  Each clause should contain at most 3 literals.

Compute its *complement*.

For each resulting clause, create a vertex.

Two vertices are connected if they are *consistent*.

Let N be the number of clause groups.  The problem is satisfiable iff there is a clique of size N.

Once youve found an N-clique, and-together the clauses for vertices to get the solution.

**Algorithm:**

Theres a straightforward algorithm that comes from this approach:

Once youve computed the complement, find a clause group with the minimum amount of clauses that are consistent with the solution thus far.  If there are multiple clauses, choose any.  If you arrive at a contradiction (a clause group with 0 clauses consistent with the solution thus far), back up and make a different clause choice.  (You dont need to make a different clause group choice.)  Youll either find a solution (satisfiable) or run out of choices (unsatisfiable).

Although I havent proved it, I assume the algorithm is exponential in the worst-case.  That being said, it seemed to perform well in some cases.  By well I mean the number of candidate solutions it went through in the worst-case was approximately the number of variables.",4,1,False,self,,,,,

(xpost from r/meteorology),https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ucdbe/computer_science_double_major_xpost_from/,mountainknits,1530126206,"Posted this on the meteorology sub earlier, but it's kind of small and I thought I might get a better answer here. I will clarify that the small about of CS related stuff I've done in the past I really liked, but am hesitant about taking on the workload of a second major if I don't have to.

I'm going back to school this fall to get a bachelors in Atmospheric Science, and I'm very excited! I've got most of a math degree from my last try at college, but ultimately decided it wasn't for me. I'm going to do a math minor at my new college, and asked about doing a computer science minor possibly at my first advising meeting last week.

It turns out my school only offers Computer Science as a major, so I'd need to double major. However, because of the way my degree program is structured, I could just take a handful of CS classes without doing the double major, but it wouldn't show on my degree. After my undergraduate, I'm planning to go to graduate school because I'm really interested in the modeling/research aspect of meteorology and want to make that my career. Since I want to pursue the modeling aspect instead of a forecasting track, is it worth it to double major in both Atmospheric Science and Computer Science? It would add a lot to my course load, but if it's what I need to do I'll do it.

TL;DR- Atmospheric Science major wanting grad school and a research career, school doesn't offer CS as a minor. Worth double majoring or should I just do Atmo with a Math minor and take a few extra classes in CS?

So I've recently been tasked with changing how the solution I maintain stores passwords. This is a 20+ year old project. Which has been in constant development in the Clarion programming language. 

Currently passwords are stored in planned text in a user's file with the name unique ID last time logged in etc. It's going to be changed so that the password is hashed and salted with a 64 character length string or alphanumeric text that will be stored in the user file the users unique ID will also be used to salt the hash.   

The reason for hashing is so that if someone gets access to the user file they can't use the information in that file to get credentials to log in. And the reason for salting is so that the same password will not have the same hash value if it has been salted. (If you bother reading this long as post please correct me if I'm wrong at any stage) 

If someone gets access to the file and can see the hashed password and the salt field and the unique ID. Someone could come to the conclusion that the password is hashed with the salt field and the unique ID. So for argument sake lets say that the password can only be a 4 digit number i.e. 0000-9999 10000 possible combinations. If someone had the file and could see the user ID the hashed password and the salt. They wrote a program to go through each record in the user file and  could brute force each password and decrypt(replicate the hash) and get the credentials to log in. As all the information is found within the file. (Sure you'd need to know the hash algorithm but this is all a hypothetical). My question is. Would adding a hardcoded addition salt make it any more secure?

So when checking the password on login in the software. You hash the password they enter the unique ID  the salt value and a hardcoded value. (I suppose this could be change per user aswell if you used the unique ID but for this lets just say a hardcoded value.) 

If you someone got the users file and wrote something to replicate the hashes when you tried these values in the actual software they wouldn't work because they wouldn't have that additional salt value. I mean sure you can dig around in memory etc but that's a faf.

I'll be going to a state university this Fall, studying Comp Sci and want to know how to maximize my efficiency ahead of time. 

In high school my setup was as follows 

I had my Mac Pro 1,1 (El Capitan, 16GB Ram, 512gb ssd, Radeon 5770) at home for heavy-duty work, mostly editing videos for media classes, gaming on windows, 3D design, Photoshop, CAD, etc. Mostly work use.

I had a 15 -inch Dell, 8GB Ram, 250 gb ssd, i7 3rd-gen I think, super heavy. I honestly used this for all my non-intensive school work, as well as light gaming since it had dedicated graphics. Battery life was poor even when we got it, heated up and fans were loud. 

Then I had a 12 or 13 inch Chromebook that I used for classes, taking notes, writing papers, research, light-stuff. Maybe some browser games, netflix, etc. I wouldn't ever bring my dell to school because it was in a dangerous area and people were constantly robbed on school grounds. Just awful. I used to have an HP Pavilion. Robbed sophomore year. Never again. 

As I'm going to school, I'll be bringing my Mac Pro with me as I'll still be using it for work, and have tossed my Dell because it was basically dead and donated my chromebook because it wasn't going to be eligible for the Android/ChromeOS Integration the newer Chromebooks are getting and to me that's important as technology moves forward that I be able to keep up hardware-wise. Not to mention, it's plastic body had taken a pounding through the years and it was slow and freezing. 

I'm going to be studying Comp Sci with an interest in software engineering, so I'm planning to get the 2015 Macbook Prom 16GB Ram, Radeon Graphics, and 512GB SSD. I've tried to use and adjust to the 2016 and 2017 models and it's not the butterfly keys, it's the escape key, the mandatory TB on the 15-inch that ruin it for me. I just dislike it. I've tried and it just messes with my mojo. Maybe if there was a physical esc keep I'd be OK. Not great but OK. Salty they have a non-TB 13-inch MBP and not that option for the 15-inch. 

While I plan to do my school work, and use Xcode, Final Cut, and more on both the Mac Pro, and MBP,  around Campus, I want a lighter device to use while on-the-go. I recently ordered a Pixelbook because I fell in love with it but my concern is just that, will the Pixelbook be a good mobile device for computer science? I'm looking into Crouton, Chroot, and other ways of loading Linux on it, but I want to know if maybe I should just get a macbook air or something? I'd be using it mainly for notes, and doing school stuff. I'd just get one laptop and be done but I'll be in Newark and have heard stories from personal friends about how Apple products attract the wrong attention and iPhones/Macs are stolen at an insane rate even on-campus. Not to mention, for my it's just ""the way it's always been"" Idk I just need to have the High-tier Machine (Mac Pro), mid-high-tier machine (Macbook Pro) and a low-tier device (Pixelbook) 

Let me know what you think will help me with my workflow as I want a device for school that will be useful for my throughout undergrad as I study computer science. When it comes to education my parents thankfully don't cheap out so if you feel that I'd be better with a Macbook 12-inch or like an air do let me know. Although fair warning, idk if it's because my glasses are strong but I can tell the difference b/w Retina and standard air screens so for me an air is a last-resort.

I have also been very interested in Computers, Technology, Programming, etc. from a very young age. I have touched languages like Python and C++ as well as built way too many websites with HTML CSS and JS. I have built many computers, I know how UNIX based operating systems work, and have tinkered with a lot of technology. I have also taken Introductory Computer Science classes over the summer at my local community college and will be taking an Algorithms Design class this next Fall. I know I want to learn more; actually, I'm excited and can't wait to learn more. However, I do know that heading into a field like this can be challenging. I have excelled in my math classes (next year I will be taking AP Calculus B/C), and I have always loved them.

I am not the type to quit though. I have felt what it's like to struggle, and I have always been a great self starter. I know I can do something I want to do.

This being said, I'd like to ask some questions to this Reddit community. Hopefully, some veteran CS related graduates can shine some light on what feels at the moment, like a very nerve-racking time in my life.

1. Those of you that felt passionate for Computer Science in high school (like I do), how did you end up with your degree? Did you change? Was it easy? Was it time consuming?
2. Do any graduates feel that I should reconsider? Stick to it?
3. What fields do you recommend if I'm leaning towards programming? What about something more hands on like Computer Hardware?

My problem is, that at 28 years of age, I'm probably going to be one of the oldest in class and one of few who already possess a master's degree. Due to financial difficulties, I can only take one class per semester, meaning that I'm not expected to graduate until I'm 35-38.

So what online courses are you currently doing? Which are on your to do list? And which do you recommend?

I just started [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) by Princeton University to prepare for the algorithms course I'm taking in fall.

I just finished part one of [Object-Oriented programming with Java](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/) by University of Helsinki, good course, I would definitely recommend it if you're getting in to coding or are about to start your first year at uni.

I also just finished [Elements of AI ](http://www.elementsofai.com/)by University of Helsinki. It's a bit high level and I already knew a lot of what they talked about, but if you're not familiar with AI it could be a fun intro to Artificial Intelligence.

[Machine learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

I haven't done this course yet, but a few friends have recommended and it's on my to do list.",3,68,False,self,,,,,

Can somebody help out?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8v1pf2/trying_to_understand_how_to_solve_recurrences/,foldo,1530363831,"The recurrence is      
`T(1) = 1`     
`T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn for n &gt; 1`


I tried to use the iterative method and got:    

`2^k * T(n/2^k) + (2^k-1)*cn`     

Then for T(1):   
`n/2^k = 1 =&gt; k = lg n`

Therefore my solution is:      
`2^lgn * T(n/n^lgn) + 2^lgn - 1 = nT(1) + n-1 = 2n-1`     

But unfortunately this is wrong according to the solution that I found. It is supposed to be `n log n + n` which makes sense considering that the problem is halved for each recursive step.       
But even after lots of google I don't really understand where I went wrong. Can somebody help me understand this?

Essentially I wasted 2 years getting an associates in IT. My plan was to self study programming while getting some kind of degree and then apply for web dev positions this year. However, Im not satisfied. While yes I probably could get a job as a developer right now I just want that bachelors in comp Sci so bad. I feel that it will open a lot of doors for me and get the whole bachelors degree thing out of my system. Im 24 and I would be 27 when I graduate from college. Also it would be completely paid for by the remainder of my GI bill so it would almost be foolish for me to not use it. I have some concerns though. I know AI and quantum computing is still a bit of a ways off, but I still worry that when I graduate in 2021 that developer positions wont be in the honey hole they are in now. I have this gut feeling the pay is going to reduce, and that AI will start rearing its head into software to the point where developers are not as valuable. What do you guys think? Am I just paranoid or is this a legit concern? Should I go through with the computer science degree like I want?",4,3,False,self,,,,,
