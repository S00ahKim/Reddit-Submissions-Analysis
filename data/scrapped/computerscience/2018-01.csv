1) Graduate in May 2019 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science 2) Graduate in May 2020 with a BS in both Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science

Part of me wants to take option 1 because it would mean an extra year of income to invest, and an extra year of experience. The other part of me thinks that I may be best served by choosing option 2 (stretching myself to 5 years of college), because it would open up more opportunities fresh out of college as well as allow me an extra year of saving, investing (albeit less than working full time), an extra internship, and the ability to travel more before graduating.

Why not have a processor generate two more signals, 'valid' and 'invalid', and then have a small buffer of memory with valid enable and invalid reset like mini RAM? I'm not sure if this would be easier but it wouldn't require tweaking the branch predictor so I feel like processing speed wouldn't be sacrificed (by 30%) which seems like the issue the media is focusing on. I'm also by no means a processor expert but might there be some existing signals that can be used to generate these 'valid' and 'invalid' signals? These signals and mini RAM could be implemented on the motherboard, and a few hundred clock cycles wouldn't require too much memory space. I figure you'd need to store the addresses of the actual memory space as well but you could also have valid enable and invalid reset for those so they would also not be saved. This seems like it would add a few clock cycles but perhaps not as many as a few hundred.

You might also have some signal, 'branch', that loads the processor with the speculative address but you could also use that signal to enable the mini RAM module. If there isn't a branch then there's no need and you can write straight to memory. Would this be viable? Am I perhaps misunderstanding memory/cache? Your thoughts please :)

P.S. if this is viable, I was also thinking that you could make a piece of hardware that fit into the CPU socket with a CPU socket of its own to facilitate speculation. Inputs could be directly connected to the CPU and outputs would go out just the same, perhaps with an infinitesimal delay from current performance times but if there's a branch you could perform the speculative execution on that piece of hardware, saving the memory and addresses and then since it's in the CPU socket if it's valid you can just execute whatever instruction it was on that memory and address that you've saved.

I'm in the process of understanding exactly what Martin Fowler's Remote Facade Pattern actually is and how it's used in practice.

Link to Martin Fowler's definition and the address example I'll be using: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/remoteFacade.html

I understand that the intention of the Remote Facade Pattern is to limit the traffic and the amount of calls made over the network, so instead of calling 3 methods separately over the network to set the address, you should make a Remote Facade that includes a single method to set all the data for the address.

The problem is that my teacher has given me the impression that a Remote Facade needs to be made on the client and not the server, but if the server only makes available 3 separate methods for setting all the address data and doesn't have a single method that combines the job, then I can make a single method on my client that calls all 3 methods on the server, but that won't result in any less traffic being sent, because 3 methods still have to be invoked over the network.

Is it wrong that the Remote Facade needs to be on the client and not the server or am I missing something?

In case it makes any difference, in terms of client/server I'm thinking about applications that would require a client and a server to communicate over the network like Socket and Web API.

I would really appreciate if you guys could help me out! Thanks in advance!",1,2,False,self,,,,,

To me, it seems like in America, Comp Sci just isn't known about as much as it should be. This goes from the average American all the way up to the president of the most powerful country in the history of the world. There just seems to be some elementary things that anybody who doesn't live under a rock should know, but don't. I'm not talking about asking somebody to write some code that does X or Y, I'm talking about the topic itself.

For example, our guy Trump made it a big part of his campaign that jobs are being lost all over the place. But even though this may be true, why doesn't he wonder why America is still the number one economy in the world, by a large margin? Maybe its because we've got the biggest tech industry in the world? As far as jobs go in America go, there is ALOT of money in the tech industry that isn't being touched right now. You got stats out their saying that there are over 500k jobs open in the industry, but just over 50k people graduate each year w/ a CS relevant degree. https://qz.com/929275/you-probably-should-have-majored-in-computer-science/ This lack of supply has been a problem for some companies, because they simply can't work on all of the projects that they actually have due to not having the talent to do so. Imagine how many more Googles, Facebooks, Snapchats, Instagrams and etc. we would have if we just had more people. And besides, these are among the highest paying jobs for anybody coming out of college. Stick with them for about 5 years, and you could cross the 6 figure threshold. 

Also, its just an issue that this is what runs the world now. We've long been done w/ the Industrial age where the wealthiest among us were those opening the factories and warehouses. The Henry Ford's of this generation are those who are the best at writing code. Its been said that whoever masters AI is going to rule the world. It's not about who is the best at manufacturing and etc, its all about TECH. America already has the largest tech industry in the world, so why not bolster that even more? Why is it that we are only now beginning to realize that we need to expose kids to CS concepts to spur their interest? I was lucky enough to go to a high school that offered a Digital Logic class, and after taking it I knew 100% that I want to do Computer Engineering. I personally believe that many more kids would stick in their CS programs in college as opposed to dropping out if they already had a previous exposure to it. Seems like the first time a lot of kids write any code is when they get to college, which is an issue because programming aint easy, and you're in college so its that much harder. 

It just seems strange that the country with the most influential tech industry in the world doesn't seem to try to encourage getting into it more heavily. You can even look at China, which realizes that if it wants to leap frog America in terms of economy and influence, it won't happen by continuing to be the Factory of the World. They're going to have to beat our Apples, Microsofts, Googles, Amazons and etc. ",31,15,False,self,,,,,

So for example if we have some code in C, if we do Compilation, we convert all of it into Machine Code, then execute it. For Translation, we convert one line of code into machine code, then execute. We do this for each line of code until the program is finished running. 

So based on that, when I get into something like Python, there are a few things that are a bit confusing. Since Python is a scripting language, its interpreted instead of compiled, so as we run the program one line of code is interpreted one line at a time until the code is finished running. Now people say that Python is run ""as is"", so does that mean a line is not converted to machine code before its ran? And if so, how is it executed? And also, how is it that Python is slower than C? For compilation, the entire code has to be converted to a smaller language and then stored in memory before its ran. For interpretation, you only run one line at a time as necessary.

This is my last year in high school and, since 10th grade, I've always thought about taking a physics degree when I went to uni. In fact, when I was a child, I spent hours on end reading about the universe.

My dream was always to be a researcher and learn a lot about theoretical physics, astronomy and astrophysics, but from what I've heard, I'm not likely to even stay in the field at all. I'll probably end up doing software engineering someplace else.

Because of that, I've been considering CS, which is something I enjoy as well, ever since I was a child. In fact, when I was 12 I was toying around with HTML. Ahahah

I've been having a bit of a change of heart on my career and been wanting to change the path I've been on. 

A little background about myself, I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance (it just seemed like the safe route) from a California State University. College was a learning experience for me because I didn't do much learning but what I did learn, closer to the end of my college career, was how to manage my own life. I spent most of my college life meeting new people, making connections, and preparing myself for the future. What I didn't do was really plan my career. Now I'm stuck finding jobs that I can't seem to find excitement in. Mostly HR, Data Input, and Office Jobs. My girlfriend said it best ""it's like you're looking for a job, not a career"".

That being said.

I wanted to jump into learning more about Computer Science. Something that I believe will be very valuable in the future, especially with all this cryptocurrency around and hacking becoming more common. With the online world exponentially growing the threats to the online world also grow. It made me want to understand this world. I found countless books to read, mostly from a subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ch0wt/a_reading_list_for_the_selftaught_computer/), and it just made me more interested in learning daily. Thus, my interest in Computer Science grew. It gave me inspiration to maybe pursue a second degree in Computer Science. It made me want to understand Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and especially Computer Security. I'm not sure if a degree would even help me find a job, because I'm a firm believer that someone can have a degree but it doesn't mean they are the best person suited for a task. Consider me as an example, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Finance and I focused my studies on Financial Management. But give me a Financial Analyst job and yeah maybe I can put a few graphs together but I can't apply that into growing a business. (yeah i'm pretty hard on myself) It's not that I regret my choices in college, because i'm sure many people do, but I do wish I applied myself more to make life a little easier as an adult.

With all that being said. What do the people of this community think my next step should be?

1) Go back to school to earn a Associates or Bachelors Degree and learn from professors?

**Pros**: I get to learn from scholars who have spent their life learning and wanting to teach the world

**Cons**: I would be in more debt... haha

2) Continue reading books and learn by finding an internship where I can find on the job training?

**Pros**: I feel like I'm a better individual learner where if I read a book it sticks. Taking tests and doing homework usually intimidate me and I don't do that well under the pressure.

**Cons**: Finding a job with a degree was already hard. I can't even imagine what it would be like to try and get one in an industry that I didn't have one in.

3) Avoid the whole thing and just stick to my day job? (Please I hope no one chooses this haha)

**Pros**: No learning involved

**Cons**: Stuck at a job I do not enjoy.


I guess my real question is do you guys believe that a second degree would be helpful? Because end of the day, I have a family to feed. So a job is necessary. Or do you guys think that if I gain the RIGHT knowledge through literature and practice the craft that I can successfully find a job in the Computer Science industry?

My background:

I graduated with a bachelors degree in biology in 2017. I majored in biology because I thought I wanted to go into healthcare; recently, I realized that I am much more interested in problem solving and working with ideas than I am working with people. CS is also attractive to me because of the vast opportunities and flexibility one has within the field. I have no formal CS background, and have just started self-teaching Python through a MOOC. The only college-level math courses I have taken are Calc I and Intro to Statistics. FWIW, I had a 3.6 undergraduate GPA from a solid state university.

My plan to get into a reputable CS program:

-Continue self-teaching basic programming (and potentially math) through MOOCs.
-Begin taking pre-requisite courses at a local community college during the summer of 2018 (and ace all of these courses).
-Take the GRE, paying special attention to the math section.
-After I learn some basic programming, I am considering reaching out to CS faculty at a local university to volunteer as a research assistant.

I'm more interested in a generic case where I am the provider of a 2 sided market and the sellers do not know exactly what their price point would be.

On one, hand I feel like he should be right since he's been in the damn industry for so long, but everything he believes flies in the face of what I hear from *everyone else, everywhere else*. So now I turn to you, r/computerscience, my fellow engineers, cs students, current members of the industry, and future leaders of the tech world: should I or should I not try to develop my own personal software projects? I've got some ideas I'm excited about that involve combining science, art, and software, and I absolutely love being creative and innovative with the stuff I do. What about graduate school and, heaven forbid, a phd, does that have any value at all? (There's nothing i'm less interested in than more school after college). I will use this post as evidence to talk to my dad if I get some good advice! Thanks ",9,1,False,self,,,,,

I originally posted this on /r/AskProgrammers, and someone there told me to try here as well.

*****

I'm doing research into how (and if) one can effectively automate the grading of a student's programming exam. This in itself comes with a few restrictions (as opposed to evaluating ""real life"" code) as the code for each task tends to be relatively short and simple. In addition, many of today's automated tests will not work, as we can't guarantee that the student's code will run or even compile.

So I'm going in another direction.  
I'm doing texutal and grammatical analysis of the code, extrapolating data points, and will use these to train a machine learning system by comparing the student's data with the same data points from the teacher's solution.

What I need is som insight or thoughts on my chosen data points. Critical feedback is appreciated, as I believe this will help me the most.  
Why could these data points work / not work, and what could be good substitutions / additions?  
(I have my own thoughts on the matter, as well as some sources regarding the use of variable names for evaluating code.)

The data I'm collecting so far:

* A list of all variables
  * Used to count the number of referred values, as well as the number of unique names
* Three flags marking if there exists
  * a for loop
  * a while loop
  * an if-statement
* A float between 0 and 1 indicating the textual similarity between the solution and the student's code

It was definitely one of the most challenging courses in the program for me. I had essentially missed the midterm exam and bombed a lot of the quizzes. I was able to get a D by getting the average on the final exam and doing fairly well on the projects. It's the only D I got in a CS class so it qualifies for credit toward the degree. I only need 2 more cs electives to graduate and my GPA is currently sitting at a ~3.25. If I were to retake the course and get an A/B I could potentially boost it to a 3.35+.

It seems inconsequential, but I'd like to leave open the opportunity for grad school in the future, maybe say GIT's OMSCS or somewhere that an employer would pay for. Would a slight 0.5+ boost in GPA be worth an additional ~$1800 in this context? It will be taught by a better professor I had before and I have all the projects done, but the pragmatist in me feels like letting this go (I also do not get financial aid, not that it even matters for a part-time semester).

My parents are very supportive in whatever decision I make, but I really don't want to waste their money. I also feel keeping the course load at 2 classes would give me more time to practice for interviews/apply for jobs and enjoy my last semester in college.

Unfortunately, my crazy ex-girlfriend is insanely jealous of my female lead singer and I believe she is making fake accounts to trash our band on Facebook and other websites we are featured on. All of the accounts have no friends and only a profile picture, so they are clearly fake. They specifically attack my singer which is why I believe it is my ex.

I plan on messaging the account saying, ""I know its you, and here's how I tracked your IP address...."" 

So basically, I need to sound convincing in how I obtained the IP address so that she will cave and admit defeat. I don't plan on actually tracking it, I just need to know enough about it so that I can back her into a corner. Any help would be much appreciated.

I'm a senior girl in high school right now debating on whether or not I should major in computer science. For the longest time I was set on majoring in it but now I'm having doubts... I'm not sure why but I'm just afraid that either i won't be interested in it or it'll be too difficult. I initially took an interest in computer science because I've always been fascinated with technology. I've obviously used computers since I was like 4 and love them. However, I have ZERO experience with coding/programming. The closest thing our school offers to a coding class is ""web page design"", which I've taken, but all we did was mess around with HTML and dreamweaver.

I initially entered with a ""wow I am 100% going to major in computer science!"" mindset, but the reason I started questioning that decision is because I'm not sure if I'm genuinely interested in purely coding/writing code. I also am a little nervous about the environment I'm going to be in since I'm a girl and computer science is predominately male, but that's not a huge factor. The main thing I'm worried about is if I'm going to be good at it, I guess.  I love trying new things and want to learn more about computers (I would specifically like to enter the field of cybersecurity) but I'm just nervous about whether or not the classes will be difficult or I will enjoy them.

So I guess my biggest question is: for those of you who had absoluely zero experience with coding, did you struggle with the classes? I'm afraid that the biggest thing holding me back is my lack of experience. Also, what can I do to help prepare myself for the classes?",40,17,False,self,,,,,

My question: I want to go into cybersecurity. That's what I want most. Can a software engineering degree get me a cybersecurity job? Follow up: are there any major differences?

is a (non) disjoint-set-data-structure meant to be dynamic?
i know that it is meant to contain dynamic sets but is the structure itself meant to be dynamic. the reason i ask is that the literature states that the structure is a set of k dynamic sets. but when you unite certain sets it frees up room for a new set. if so how can you access the freed up space if you want to add a new singleton set?

how do you implement union(A,B) in O(|A|,|B|)
mind you this is the union of sets that might not be disjoint. were they disjoint i can easily achieve O(1) time by implement the sets with linked lists. Also, i realize we achieve O(|A|+|B|) average time by computing the hash of all values in A and then going through all the hashes of the values in B, but this is obviously not worst case O(|A|+|B). I thought it might be possible to achieve the worst case time with perfect hashing but this is not really on our curriculum so i assume there must be a simpler solution

I am working on a research paper about the changing tasks within occupations, and I'm hoping you can help me find a resource for comprehensive computing history. I'm looking for a database, academic paper or book that can provide a list of major technological advances from the 20th Century (ideally with creators and introduction dates). So far, I've read computer science history books and reviewed the academic literature for similar products less than successfully.

Any information is welcome, including the information that this may not exist. Thank you!

*A little bit more, if you're interested*: I have a list of ""technologies"" (programing languages, system software/operating systems, networking and software programs) that appeared in job postings from 1960-2000. In order to get a better sense of how specific the job requirements are, I would like to compare it to a greater list of technology available at the time. 

I have read a few chapters of computing history textbooks, but I'm not sure how comprehensive they are. I've also found similar research performed specifically for computer science careers. The authors broke up the ""technologies"" into categories (i.e. software generations, database software, mainframe or desktop hardware, etc.) which isn't quite right for my goal. There are also a ton of really cool timelines and compilation websites, but none seem as rigorously sourced as I'd like. 

My ideal resource would be an academically researched database of technological advances, including creators, creation dates, obsoletion dates and popularity. But honestly, I would accept a timeline made in MS Paint that was published in a computer science journal. ",1,6,False,self,,,,,

I really liked it and even found myself not sleeping at one point for 32 hours just trying out everything. Ever since I came to college I wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon, but playing around with code seemed so much more interesting. It was such an open world, even when two people had the same design the code could have been so different. It just felt like there was so much I could explore at the time. Becoming a doctor does not have much of this. Exploration is minimal until you are already a professional. I feel like that creative difference just meant so much to me.

Anyways, I am also not spontaneous to a fault. I know HTML/CSS is just basic coding, even for web design. However, I want to start working at coding and computer science as if I will do it for a career, and if it ends up not being what I thought, I will just let it go.

I am in a bit of horrible, scary position that I have made for myself. I am graduating at the end of this spring semester and I feel I have nothing to show for it when applying for jobs (and I have yet to begin). This whole ordeal gives me major anxiety and have kept putting this off, so much so that I have not even created a resume because I have nothing to put on itwhat /could/ I put on it?

I always struggled with material and had to spend much time keeping up with lessons and assignments because of it, and any remaining time was spent working a food service job to help with paying college expenses. I could list out all the little reasons I could possible think of but the fact of the matter is that I have no valid reason for not being involved in extracurriculars or research or even a single internship that any recruiter would care for. I just always felt I wouldnt be good enough or as good as my peers and avoided any situation where I would have to prove my competence. 

Now I am about to graduate with no experience, no personal for-fun projects, or research to list on a resume and little confidence. Absolute zero. 

I was thinking I could perhaps try to apply for internships before applying for jobs to gain experience and something to show to job recruiters, or taking time off after graduation to try and learn more on my own and try working on personal projects before applying for jobs (any suggestions as to what I should self-teach?). 

I was hoping anyone here could tell me how sound/reasonable my plan sounds and/or offer some new advice about what I should do (I know I should go to career services, but I want to hear what you guys have to share).

I have this assignment where i need to use an algorithm called jumpset  to implement search in a sorted linked list L.  

&amp;nbsp;

The jumpset algorithm assigns 1 or more ""jump"" pointers to each object in L.  

&amp;nbsp;

Initially x.jump is set to x.next for each object x in L  

&amp;nbsp;

Then a loop is entered which continues so long L.head.jump!=NIL.  

 &amp;nbsp;

For each iteration i of this loop an inner loop is initiated which traverses the objects in L, skipping 2^(i) objects per iteration.  

 &amp;nbsp;

So for example, for a list of length 10 we get  

 &amp;nbsp;

1st iteration:  

 &amp;nbsp;

L[1].jump.= L[3]

L[3].jump=L[5]

L[5].jump=L[7]

L[7].jump=L[9]

L[9].jump=NIL

 &amp;nbsp;

2nd iteration  

 &amp;nbsp;

L[1].jump=L[5]

L[5].jump=L[9]  

 &amp;nbsp;

3rd iteration  

 &amp;nbsp;

L[1].jump=L[9]  

&amp;nbsp;

4th iteration  
&amp;nbsp;

L[1].jump=NIL

 &amp;nbsp;

I believe i understand how to search for an object x using the pointers generated by the above algorithm.  If we store the pointers assigned to x in x.p, you just start with L.head.p and follow its trail of pointers until you reach an object y equal to or larger than x. if x=y you return TRUE, else you repeat the same process L[y].  

 &amp;nbsp;

Eventually, if x is not in L you will reach a NIL object from which there are no pointers and so you return FALSE.  

 &amp;nbsp;

My problem is i cannot figure out the runtime of this method.  

 &amp;nbsp;

Obviously its O(n), but the naive solution for insertion into a linked list has O(n) time too, so it seems reasonable to assume this method would lower the boundary. Why else should we bother with this method?  

 &amp;nbsp;

I hope someone can help me. If it is needed i will gladly send the original specification for the jumpset algorithm

I work as a data scientist and have a background in mathematics (Bsc) and econ/finance (Bsc + Msc). At my current position I feel insufficient in programming since I more or less need to work as a fullstack developer and a data scientist. I work mostly in Python, but lack the sophisticated experience with testing, error handling, and building real systems. I want to have the same knowledge as someone who has a CS degree.

I have made a plan to go through all the undergrad course material that my university offers at the computer science Bsc. The programming oriented courses are:

* Computer Introduction
* Introduction to Programming
* Programming  Second Course
* Evaluation of Software Systems
* Discrete Structures in Computer Science
* Object-oriented Modelling and Design
* Computer Communication
* Algorithms, Data Structures and Complexity
* Functional Programming
* Concurrent Programming

Most of the courses have free pdf books, GitHub repos, and so on. And the other ones have recommended course books. Also, there are slides and exercises or all courses.

What do you think about this approach? Since I do not have exams I will probably not study as hard as if I was doing the degree. But I love reading, and I can imagine that I'll spend 1-2 hours per weekday and maybe more on the weekends. And then in a couple of months I will have gone through the books, the lectures and so on.

So what do you think about this approach compared to just learning by doing, or learning on Google or whatever? I feel that this is a structured way of learning and that I will probably feel more comfortable afterwards since then also know what knowledge other people with CS degrees have and what is expected of me.

I would like to be able to work as a software developer if I want and not only data science.

I'm currently a junior in high school and I've been interested in computers since I was a little kid. My gaming habits have always been my greatest asset, I taught myself to read at the age of 5 because I didn't want to wait for my mom to read what my Pokmon characters were saying, I learned how to fix certain file corruptions because of games not working etc.

I'd always looked at high school as being an amazing opportunity to learn more about these machines. But getting into high school and realizing how misleading all the teachers telling me how great of an opportunity high school would be for my future career was severely disappointing.

We have 2 computer classes currently, foundations of computer science, and AP computer science principles. Doesn't sound too bad right? Well don't let the names fool you. Foundations of comp sci was learning how to use office 365. I was made fun of for taking an easy A class for what I thought would be my first hands on experience with programming. I feuded to my friend who ended up teaching me some basic batch commands.

AP comp sci principles might as well have been called computer history. We had a 3 week unit on Python and HTML. I was in love with it. I went home after learning the Python print commands and wrote a 400 line Python game in 5 hours. It was inefficient, and sloppy. But it was mine. I excelled in my computer class easily being the most advanced programmer in the class aside from the teacher. And the unit ended. And I've been left by my school to teach myself. 

We have 4 computer labs and 5 carts of laptops. We have plenty of computers. Our teacher fought to get us more classes that he knew would be put upon him to teach. And they told him they'd let him teach it. 

Success! Or so we thought. They never gave him a class number, schedule or anything resembling an effort to make this class a reality. He'd go back to the administration week after week being told to fill out a form and wait. He got fed up with it and took a poll. 127 students were interested in taking this class. My school only has about 1000 kids. A voluntary elective getting 12.7% of the school interested with one teacher being capable of teaching it. That would be at least four classes. This finally got our principle to offer the class.

After next year.

2 more comp sci classes were to be offered. One being a prerequisite to the next. I am being denied a class that could drastically change my college career. While I'm appreciative of the opportunity my school offered me, I'm angry that I have more opportunities to become an artist, a linguist, or a child care professional than I would learning any programming.

I study in a French-speaking country. The curriculum is part of a School of Engineering, and the degree's name in French is ""Diplome d'Ingnieur en Informatique"" (Equivalent of a Master's degree). The first 3 years are common between all students, and later on we choose a specialization (Web, Mobile, Embedded Systems, Data Science, Business Intelligence, etc...) for 2 years. Those first 3 years are called ""Tronc commun Informatique et Telecommunication"" (TIC for short) and they are equivalent to a Bachelor's degree. But a Bachelor's in what?

These are the headlines of all the study units we have:

1st year:
- Procedural Programming, Algorithms &amp; Data Structures in C
- Game Development project using Linux Terminal &amp; SDL in C
- Math
- Operating Systems &amp; Networking &amp; Computer Architecture
- Electronics
- Multimedia

2nd year:
- Object Oriented Programming in C++
- C++ project
- Project in Web Development Technologies
- Math
- Introduction to Information Systems Modelisation
- Communication Networks
- Databases
- Microcontrollers Architecture

3rd year:
- OOP in C#
- OOP in Java
- UML
- Administration &amp; Security of Operating Systems (Unix)
- Statistics &amp; Probability
- IP Network &amp; Network Interconnection
- Language Theory
- Software Engineering
- Web Development Technologies
- Mobile Development
- Management Systems for Databases
- Web + Mobile Project
- Math
- Business Management (Financial Analysis and Decisions, Business Environment)

Does this curriculum look more like a Computer Science one or a Software Engineering one?

Also the headlines are literally translated from French so their correct names in English might be somewhat different.

I'm a student from Amsterdam, and at the moment I'm working on my bachelor graduation project. I'm setting up a new blog, where I'll focus on concepts like (computer)technology, automation, science, innovation and philosophy. In a nutshell, the big question I'm focussing is how IT-tech as a general purpose technology is affecting innovation processes in science and technology. How does it change the nature of the game? Philosophy will also be a major part in my analysis, by the way.

It's required to do some research into the target audience. I choose a survey tool. This subreddit and it's people - you: computer science fanatics, like me - are exactly whom I'll be targetting with my blog.

So my question is, would you all be so kind to help me out with me survey? It only takes a couple of minutes of your time, but to me it would mean the world. I included the survey link on the bottom of my post.

What the subreddit gains from this? The subject &amp; aim of my blog is closely related to what /r/computerscience covers. I'll regularly post articles and interviews, which I hope you'll all love - this community is my target audience, after all. If anyone is interested, I could share the results here later.

It would be a huge boost to my research and the blog in general. I want to thank everyone no matter what, thanks for your help &amp; time guys! &lt;3

a) UCD has more breadth as its a 16 month course vs 12 months at Birmingham. However this means being out of work for 4 months longer.

b) I am British, living in London, so Birmingham would allow me to access the job markets of midlands, North and London quite comfortably.

c) Birmingham seems to be better ranked, though this is marginal at best.

My background is a law degree, but I have found a great interest in technology and programming when I started to learn Java as a hobby. As I learn more, I realise that the circle of 'what I need to know to be effective' grows ever wider. For me, it is insufficient simply to understand how to write a loop, or a method etc.

There seems to be a vast amount of CS which is not simply 'programming' which I am missing out on by only studying a language. A few of these topics I have seen are Data Structures, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Networking, and even 'How a computer works!!!'

I feel that a broader knowledge would help me understand better exactly what I am doing, and all of the jargon which honestly goes over my head.

Now, I would like to establish a few rules with y'all:

    Q = {0, 1, 2}
    Si = {a, b} # Sigma
    S = {0}
    F = {2}
    E = {(0, 'b', 0), (0, 'a', 1), (1, 'b', 1), (1, 'a', 2), (2, 'b', 2)}

The presentation slide defines $E hat$ as the following, as far as I can read:

- Any 3 tuple of the form $( q , sigma , q' )$ in the set of E, if it exists, shall also exist in the same form with the same values in the set $E hat$.
- Any pairs of 3-tuples that show such a connection $q sub 1 = q sub 1$ in perhaps different positions in the tuples in the set $E hat$, if it exists, then there also exists a more concise form of such a pair in the form $( q sub 0, sigma sub 1, sigma sub 2, q sub 2)$ with the same values copied in the same set $E hat$.

My question is: What is the point of the set $E hat$ and why are we learning this?  It doesn't seem to be helpful in parsing anything with my machine.

So, given the quintuple parameters, I have constructed the set $E hat$ (`Eh`) using the following python code:

    Eh = E.copy()
    Eh = {(t[0], t[1] + u[1], u[2]) for t in Eh for u in Eh if t[2] == u[0]} | Eh

Well, anyway, that was kind of useless, idk.  I got this output for `Eh`:

    {(0, 'a', 1), (0, 'aa', 2), (2, 'bb', 2), (1, 'ba', 2), (0, 'bb', 0), (0, 'ab', 1), (1, 'bb', 1), (0, 'ba', 1), (1, 'a', 2), (2, 'b', 2), (1, 'b', 1), (0, 'b', 0), (1, 'ab', 2)}

But, moving on!
According to the slide, they say that the formal language $L(A)$ (`LA` in my code) is defined as $left { w | q sub s \\(mo S, q sub f \\(mo F, ( q sub s , w , q sub f ) \\(mo E hat right }$.  I don't actually expect anyone to understand that eqn code (if you wanna see the math, look at the slide), but here's the Python code according to my interpretation that does something like that:

    LA = {w for qs, w, qf in Eh if qs in S and qf in F}

This is the result I got for `LA`:

    {'aa'}

Frankly, that was a bit more useful than `Eh`, and it also happens to be the exact input that can drive the finite state machine to land on the accept (final) state.  But that's just two characters!  How about machines that take 3 or more characters in order to drive it to its final state?

So, the questions are:

- What are $E hat$ and $L(A)$ really for?
- What about machines that take 3 or more characters to be in its final state?  `L(A)` becomes an empty set, right?
- Did I interpret the math correctly?

    S = {0} # Start states
