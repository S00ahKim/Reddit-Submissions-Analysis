I'm a 19 year old guy currently attending my first year of university. So far, I've been mainly focused on getting GER credits out of the way, so I haven't had much time to focus on learning about computer science.

What I want to do is come up with a comprehensive computer science course for myself - yes, I'm at university, but I feel like I could better utilize my time and I want to learn as much as possible.

My aim with computer science is to become something of a Jack of All Trades, but specifically I'd love to devote a lot of my skills and effort into supporting emulators, WINE, and working on GNU/Linux in general. 

I would say that I currently have a somewhat above average knowledge of computers already, but nothing special; I'd like to learn a lot more and, even more than that, put what I learn into practice.

For learning materials and resources, I have a course on Udemy about learning C++, I've been using Codecademy to learn Python, and of course there are always books and YouTube videos. The questions are, what should I learn, in what order should I learn them, and how should I go about learning them?

Some things I believe are of importance to learn: the Linux file system, using the Linux terminal and the Windows Command Prompt, understanding basic networking and firewalls, thinking like a programmer, learning at least C++ and Python, debugging, emulation. 

What more things would you suggest, and at what pace/in what order? And do you have any resources available that would help or teach me?

I just wanted to ask quickly since I always mix things up - how would you define these things?

1. What type of word do you use to describe Linux/macOS? Are they UNIX-based systems? Wouldn't Windows be called a UNIX-based system as well?

2. What do you call terminal commands? Are they UNIX commands or Linux commands? (e.g. ls, cd) Or are they shell scripts? If they're Linux commands, are macOS

49,computerscience,t5_2qj8o,2018-8-4,2018,8,4,19,94i4e2,self.computerscience,The most asked question,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/94i4e2/the_most_asked_question/,smokemayo,1533377401,"The most asked question I see when it comes to learning programming is ""How do I get started?"".

I feel like what you really mean to be asking is ""How do I get where I want to be?"". In order to answer that question, you need to know where that is.

There are many different reasons why someone would want to learn how to program and I feel like when the question of ""Where do I start?"" is asked, the response is never quite right.

Generally you see the same responses. Youtube, Code Camp, College but it's not really the answer you were looking for. You want to know how to create a piece of software. The first step to doing that is learning the basics of a programming language. Tutorials and books are a great [start](http://www.youtube.com) to doing this but just knowing the languages basic syntax isn't enough.

When you finally get the basics of a language down you will have the skills you need to start a project. This includes knowing variables, conditions, loops, operators, data types, functions, classes and documentation. This process doesn't actually take very long, college classes usually take about two semesters to teach this but it can be [self-taught](https://www.udemy.com/) a lot quicker. When you get to this point you can start working on your first project.

In the process of creating your first project, whether it be a random number generator or a fully equipped web application, you will be researching and further teaching yourself what you need to know to finish. The process will be slow and at times frustrating but the next time you run into a similar problem, you'll know exactly what you need to do to fix it.

There is a possibility that your project won't turn out quite as imagined, but the entire process was a learning experience. When you choose to tackle your next projects you will then have those skills learned from the previous project to make the process a lot easier.

An important thing to note is that developers (and artists) will get overwhelmed trying to create every feature that they envisioned in their application at one time. There is a process to everything and you have to remember to take your time. Get something as close to what you want it to be on the screen. It can be extremely buggy and look terrible but if it's serving the function you created it to do you are on the right track. You can worry about the cosmetics later.

Another important note is that there are a ton of [resources](https://stackoverflow.com/) to help ease this entire process. Linked throughout this post are a few. There are also a lot of different tools and platforms used to create these applications. It is all dependent on what you are trying to get done. If you wanted to create a dynamic web site you would want to learn HTML and CSS. If you wanted to add some advanced functionality to that website such as a user log in system, you would possible learn JavaScript and NodeJS. If you wanted to learn how to create video games you would more than likely learn a C language and use a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. It is all extremely situational.

Finally, i'd like to share the most important advice I've ever received in the field. That advice is: don't reinvent the wheel. If there is something you need to get done, chances are someone has done it for you and they are allowing you to use that in your software. An application is usually like a big puzzle that has been put together by the developer. For example: The popular video game ""Fortnite"" was created in the Unreal Engine mentioned above. They didn't go through and create their own engine with collision and artificial gravity from scratch. That would be expensive and a waste of time. They used a resource that was already available to them and added their own software and style to it and created one of the worlds most popular video games.

I hope that this post helps people who are interested in getting into the computer science field or learning programming. It's a great skill to have and it can be extremely rewarding but it takes a lot of patience. Keep learning and working and eventually you will be where you want to be.

In other words, stored ""bits of information"" on computer registers are best thought of as electrical potential energy. Does that makes any sense?

Then I read a sentence from a related [Wikibooks article](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/CIE/Computer_systems,_communications_and_software/Components_of_a_computer_system_and_modes_of_use/Types_of_software) that threw me for a loop:

&gt;*""Software components of a computer system have no physical presence, they are stored in digital form within computer memory.""*

What does that mean? Was I wrong in my initial assumption? Do electric charges themselves retain large chunks of information?

See, to me this is important because until the very recent past, I believed that being a programmer was more or less the same thing as being a computer scientist, insofar as what you need to know before pursuing a career in software development. For example, my understanding was that if you want to become involved in the development of video games, you *need* to know every last minutae of how computers work - how electric current is transferred via millions of transistors and logic gates, how these are represented on-screen, etc. You need to know the architecture of your game's graphics engine, you need to be 100% fluent in programming languages (i.e. never needing to look anything up - you know off by heart what to type, and *where* to type it), and so on and so forth. It shocked me to learn that programmers oftentimes don't even fully grasp how computers work at the absolute lowest levels of abstraction. Shouldn't they?

For example, my goal would be to create a data structure abstraction like such:

    var intList = new IntegerList();
    // append [1,10]
    for i in 1..10 do intList.append(i); 
    for rng in intList do writeln(rng); // 1..10
    // append [2,20] in strides of 2
    for i in 2..20 by 2 do intList.append(i); 
    for rng in intList do writeln(rng); // 1..9 by 2, 2..20 by 2

While the above example is rather naive, I ask this because I have a problem where I want to perform automatic compression of ranges on the fly because we can have potentially millions and billions of integers; we are targetting exascale hardware so it could go past that in the future. Something that can automatically eliminate duplicates would be great too, as well as something parallel-safe/concurrent, but that isn't a necessary requirement.

If one does not exist, would there be any advice on how to create such a data structure? I was thinking that a simple List or flat/contiguous storage container would be far too naive, and maybe something like a tree could be constructed. The only data structure I have found was an [Interval Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree), but that stores individual elements, I just want the intervals by themselves.

Assistance would be appreciated.

i started the 2nd semester of last year, now i'm taking the summer semester of this year.  

Question 1:is studying university subjects enough? everytime i ask someone what to do with my free time they say have fun, yet a lot of people say that university only gives you a headstart, and you should study on your own, which side is true? i find myself with a huge advantage over others simply because of the reason that i really love computer science, i can sit for days reading/solving questions without getting bored,Every professor i meet tells me that i'm smart and i have Potential to be good at what i do, i'm starting to believe that but i am afraid of wasting that potential, which is what this whole thread is about, How to achieve my full Potential?

Question 2:What to do in my free time? i took c++ and currently taking java and i'm finding myself with too much free time on my hand, the stuff i take is really easy and we are moving really slowly ,I take 2 hours everyday to solve Codeforces questions and random questions i find online just to strengthen my problem solving skills, even then i still find myself with a lot of free time, how can i use that time efficiently? A lot of people tell me i should just have fun, go out and enjoy this time, I am doing exactly that, and still have some left over time, Should i learn a Programming language ? learn a new subject?  
  
  ___________________  


Question 3: How do i organize what to learn and in what order? for example, i want to learn about networking, i find myself jumping from eli the computer guy, to random youtubers, to internet pages, to udemy courses, while i learn from all of that, i find the information scrambled and cant connect them together, What i need is a Guide or an index telling me what to start with and how to progress.    
  
___________________


Question 4:Should i worry from all the people with existing programming knowledge? There are a lot of these people who knows a lot of information at an early age, i see them doing world-wide contests, being popular for that reason, i strive to be like that , but what are the steps towards that? is doing Q1/Q2 enough?

I am going into my third year at university, and I need to make a decision. I am currently an Industrial and Systems major, though I like computer science. I have excelled in both programming classes I have taken, one for my major in [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) and one for my minor, programming fundamentals 1 in Java.

I am (relatively) good at programming and I am passionate about it. I often push off my other work to get ahead in my programming classes. My professor told me that the CSE minor is pretty extensive, and that I wouldn't be missing a ton by not majoring in CSE. For reference the minor is:

Introduction to Computer Organization

Programming Fundamentals 1  
and Programming Fundamentals 2

Data Structures and Algorithm

Operating Systems

Applications of Discrete Structures

Analytic Geometry and Calculus 2 

I originally chose ISE because it is so versatile though I often think of changing my major to Computer Science Engineering. I haven't really taken many ISE classes so I don't really know how much I like it, though I do like its emphasis on statistics. I'm still not entirely sure what I want to do when I graduate.

So, I guess my question is, how much Computer Science education do y'all think I'm missing out on? Also for those with experience in ISE, how valuable are these skills in relation to Computer Science. I know a lot of people study statistics and computer science to work machine learning. Also, it seems like a decent combination to work with the Internet of Things. On one hand, I would like to keep my options open to maybe even work in sales engineering or go to law school (sort of just an out there example, but I don't really know.)

Hypercomputation is a ""cheat"" that extends the capability of a Turing machine or quantum computer or cellular automaton by adding extra abilities. A standard method is ""Oracle machines"", Turing machines with an extra black box device that can be queried and give an output that normally would be uncomputable. For example, a halting oracle would tell the machine a bit encoding whether an input program would ever terminate. Such ""hypercomputation"" machines can calculate various forms of uncomputable outputs.

My main question here is: Could a hypercomputational device/computer compute all kinds of incomputable things? I mean, even impossible things or things that do not/cannot exist, like Russell's set problem solution?

Another computer scientist told me (referring to this question):

Computing something implies determining some properties of that thing. But if a thing cannot exist, it cannot have any properties either, right? Like ""if xx is either 0, 1, or 2, but it is not 0, not 1, and not 2; then is xx even?"" is a question that makes little sense...

But Oracles (a type of hypercomputational device) can compute other incomputable things (as it is said at the beginning of this question) that do not exist. So what is happening here?

Ive learned general CS concepts and some algorithms now, but I have no real proof that I know anything so Im wondering if I need more projects, but I dont really have any impressive ideas.

Honestly, a lot of my hobbies have to do with unplugging like fitness, cooking, and being outside. Thats what I love spending my free time on, but I do occasionally get ideas for stupid and useless little fun projects that I think Id find entertaining enough to spend time on, but do projects need to actually solve problems to be taken seriously? Would it suffice to build and put on my resume things that maybe demonstrate a CS concept in a fun way, but it doesnt really do anything remarkable?

Thats the kind of stuff I find interesting and could see myself doing lol. Im pretty sure that was made by someone already in the field, and Im not at that level to do something like that yet. I also only have a month so Id probably make mini projects that work in a browser or a codepen.

For example:
MVI A, 0Fh
MVI B, 55h
AND A, B

(MVI being Move Immediate which moves a byte of data (right side, source) from memory to the accumulator or a register (left side, destination).

I just had a quick question about switching career paths and trying to find a job in the computer science feild. I am currently going into my senior year of my bachelor's degree as an English major and have decided that I'm no longer intrigued by the feild (although I figured I should just finish up this degree anyway). I would love to get into the computer science world and am currently trying to find the best/quickest/most economical path to get there. I have found one master's program that consists of 10 online classes where you can obtain your masters (regardless of your undergraduate degree) in just 12 months, yet this seems to good to be true. So far these are the paths that I've seen I can take to break into this feild:

1) get my associates degree in CS and see if I may be able to get a job with just this (I am leaning towards this option because it would only take a year and a half)

2) go for my bachelor's in CS, although it would be three long years full time, would it allow me to have a better job in the future?

3) go for to 10 class masters and hope an employer will be okay with me having my bachelor's in a completely unrelated feild (I also think this would be a good route just because it would only take a year to complete)

What are your thoughts? Like I said, the quickest path that could land me in this feild would be great! And thank you so much for your replys!!!",10,1,False,self,,,,,

Trying to understand this method, and its magical constant, was sort of my white whale. It wasn't until 2014, right after I graduated from college, that I finally understood how the method came about. It's actually deceptively simple, and I think that anyone, with a bit of luck, could have come up with this constant.

In fact, you could even create up constants for the sqrt, inverse cube root, and any rational or irrational powers. You can also use a similar technique to create approximations of exp, log, and geometric means.

The fast inverse sqrt method is essentially this approximation:

```
float invsqrt(float y) {
  	int i  = * ( long * ) &amp;y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
	i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i &gt;&gt; 1 );               // what the fuck? 
	return * ( float * ) &amp;i;
}
```

in essence, it seems like if you take the bitwise IEEE 754 representation of the float y, as a 32bit integer, divide it by 2 (the left shift by 1), then subtract it from 0x5f3759df, and finally treat it as a float again, then you somehow get a value that seems to approximate 1/sqrt(y), with up to 10% relative error for the range of floating point numbers.

Why?

To answer this question, let's start with some simpler notations. We'll use the function float2int(y) to denote the conversion that takes in a IEEE 754 floating point number, and outputs its machine representation as a 32bit int; basically what the first line does. We'll also define the inverse function int2float(i) that performs the reverse conversion. Obviously, float2int and int2float will be inverses of each other.

Now, the question is why int2float(0x5f3759df - float2int(y) / 2) approximates the inverse sqrt function.

Well, this is where the luck comes in. Assuming that you got curious and started looking at the function

    f(y, m) = int2float(m - float2int(y) / 2)

and you have a plot where you can fix an arbitrary constant m, and plot out the curve for f(y, m) in terms of y, what would you see?

Well, as luck would have it, you can [try this out](http://www.phailed.me/2014/10/0x5f400000-understanding-fast-inverse-sqrt-the-easyish-way/#Adding%20Alpha).

If you plot the curve for just invsqrt(y) on the same graph, you'll notice that, as you vary m, your function is just a multiplicative factor away from invsqrt(y). That is, f(y, m)/invsqrt(y) is linear-ish, and your task is to find the value of m that makes this ratio go to 1 (or as close to 1 as you can manage for as many values of y as you can manage).

So how do we solve this problem? Well, the way that the original authors did was to treat this as a boundary value problem; e.g., use some value of y that simplifies the equations as much as possible. Their choice was to set y = 1 at one end of the boundary:

    1 = f(1, m)/invsqrt(1)

this simplifies to

    1 = int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1

and recalling that int2float and float2int are inverses, we have

    float2int(1) = float2int(int2float(m - float2int(1)/2)/1)
      = m - float2int(1)/2

which gives

    m = 1.5 * float2int(1)

I'll save you the troubles of computing float2int(2), it is 0x3f800000, so, to satisfy the boundary condition, the magic constant would come to be 1.3 * 0x3f800000 = 0x5f400000.

This is very close to the 0x5f3759df, so how do we close the gap? Well, it turns out that if you graph the errors of this plot, you'll notice that the error is always positive. As a result, if you just subtract a little bit off of 0x5f400000, you can actually halve the absolute value of the error by shifting half of the error down into the negative side. Finding the optimal constant is then a simple task of bisecting through viable constants while minimizing the maximum absolute value of the relative error.

This method also generalizes to arbitrary powers. It turns out that for any power, c, you can approximate y^c by

    int2float(0x3f800000 * (1 - C) + C * float2int(y))

And finally, with a bit of analysis, you can also derive analogue laws for exp and logarithms, e.g. in https://github.com/leegao/float-hacks#exp-redux.",12,77,False,self,,,,,

I just started my very first intro to programming CS course a few days ago. I am concerned that this major isn't for me because I don't have prior knowledge. I managed to do the step-by-step short program that the professor gave us.They gave us step by step instructions on how to input everything into the software we are using for the class. It took me two days to do because I have a MacBook Air and I was trying to figure out how to install the software onto it so that it would work, and I even went to the head professor/Dean of computer science and they said I'd have to pay money to Microsoft so that I can get a license to legally run windows on my Mac and because I couldn't do that I emailed my professor to see if I could write the codes on my window desktop and transfer it/ directly save it into a flash drive, but that idea isn't working properly, because I'm having trouble saving it properly. The project is due on the 20th but its a soft due date. I am also weak in math and science I got a B in both my pre algebra and elementary algebra classes. I had bad grades in high school for math and science classes barely scrapping by with C's. I have liked math and science I never dreaded it, but I never had a particular good aptitude for it, partially because I have a lot of anxiety and because it takes me a while to understand things. Even though I did finish the step by step code that the professor gave us, and I am going to submit it tomorrow, because I want to go over it one more time. I'm worried that I won't be able to do anything the minute those instructions are gone. I am determined to work hard for this class. And my math class, I have noticed that after I came into college last year I have developed a particular fondness for math. It's just that I've heard that you should feel a particular sense of accomplishment after figuring out your first code, but I didn't I spent hours trying to figure it out, I went to bed close to 12 Am last night and I woke up early just so that I could work on it, to see if I could figure something out, but once I did, I didn't feel a sense of accomplishment, I felt relief but no ""Yay!"" moment occurred. I talked to the dean, and my tutor (for math and comp. Science) they both think that I will be able to do this major if I work whole heartedly towards it. I've talked to other students and they have years of experience and I have none. I was learning from an app called ""solo learn."" and I really enjoyed programing on it and I was excited about all the things that I was learning but as soon as I started the class I began feeling lost and unprepared. I am overwhelmed. The only reason I am trying this major out is because a someone told me about it a while ago and after doing some research I came across khan academy's cs and programing course, which I am trying out right now and although it is kind of frustrating, (I've only watched a few videos, nothing more.) I don't have any experience at all. I like it so far. Although its taking me a long time to teach myself and I have to rewatch the videos on Khan Academy over and over  I have to ask questions about How? What? Why? and When? before I fully understand something and even then I have to go over material multiple times before it clicks in my head. I didn't even know what computer science was until probably a year ago. Also next fall in 2019 I'll be taking Physics and because I've never taken physics before I wanted to ease myself in so I am taking general physics then the following semester after that class I'll be taking the actual physic classes required for transferring as a CS major. Also I am worried that due to my lack of knowledge on the subject matter I won't understand anything and end up failing the class. prior to this I did sign up for the same cs class but ended up dropping it before the class started because I was so anxious and overwhelmed with fear, because I was intimidated by the fact that I had no knowledge on the subject matter.

And for the longest time my anxiety has been getting in the way of me attempting this course.. What should I do? A lot of people are telling me that I shouldn't go for it because my lack of knowledge and because I'm doubting myself.

Long story short I've been looking at other universities' computer science courses and I am starting to think that I am not being taught enough. I get about 16-25 hours teaching time per week.

I have two questions in particular;
1. Do you think the units listed are sufficient?
2. What units should I be doing on my own time?


(This is a top 100 university)

But, I still feel like I'm in a race i'll never have a chance of winning. My friend who inspired me to join this field made me feel very small. He said that it's extremely competitive in this field which is why you need to make yourself stand out. He programmed for 5 years before college and this past summer he was involved in research for the university in the field. I feel so behind him and I wonder how things will go. I really don't know much about this field. I know people need to have personal projects and internships but I don't have either of those. I'm pretty creative and I'm sure I can definitely think of projects but I don't know how to even start. My friend has pretty cool projects and I don't even know where to start to get to that point. I'm so lost right now and I'm hoping someone can clear up some of this for me. It seems like the journey to an entry level job in programming is super complicated as well as competitive. They don't inform any of this stuff in school so I have no idea where to get information for stuff like this.",24,46,False,self,,,,,

I'm about to enter in my final year as a computer science student and I want to begin with my project as early as possible. Initially I was looking to write a compiler for my programming language, but after reading a while the Dragon Book I realized that I will not be able to finish in time such an ambitious project considering that I also work as a part time software developer. After, I started to search for some good ideas that could use Java for the implementation (this is my favorite programming language and the one that I work with) and ended up with these: 

1)  A build tool just like Maven/Gradle

\- written in Java;

\- I will use YAML representation for the project model file a.k.a Maven's pom.xml or Gradles's settings.gradle;

\- Ensure dependency management: downloading libraries in a local repository;

\- Implement the following tasks: validation of project, source code compilation, running all unit tests, and packaging the source code in a JAR (also handling executable jars with Manifests, and Uber jars). In this manner I will obtain a build life cycle. 

\- If everything is ok at this point I will try to enhance and add some performance improvement, running the build on multiple threads.

2)  A distributed learning system that allows teachers via network connection to share their screen and present to multiple participants a lecture. The teacher can also see the screen of a specific student, while a student cannot see the screens of the other students

\- The server would be written in Java, while the client will be written in HTML, CSS, Javascript.

\- I will use some library for JS, probably React with Redux

I also searched for some technologies I found Google's Kythe, Apache Hadoop, IPFS protocol or Quantum Computing (I have no idea about quantum mechanics or linear algebra so I don't think that I have enough time to invest on this subject).

To be honest I would like to implement the first idea (the build tool) but I don't know how complex it is and if I have time to do it.

What other ideas do you have for a final year CS project?

Normally this wouldn't be an issue if the data was already there obviously but I thought it would be an interesting way to get my feet wet with SAS/SQL. Also, my program requires me to randomly select galaxies from my data (.fit formatted as pd.DataFrame() after using astropy.fits package) and I'd like the code to automatically retrieve data from SDSS's database regardless of which objects are randomly generated. 

For each galaxy theres an object id # (objID) that labels the dataset for each galaxy. Is it possible to pull very specific data (SQL querey) from the command line / IDE (anaconda) in python?

CSC 320
Algorithms - A systematic study of algorithms and their complexity, including searching and sorting algorithms, mathematical algorithms, scheduling algorithms, and tree and graph traversal algorithms. The classes P and NP, NP-complete problems, and intractable problems.


CSC 385
Formal Logic and Computation Theory - An introduction to sentential and first-order logic including logical connectives, proof theory, and quantification. Formal models of computation including finite state automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. Incompleteness and uncomputability.


MAT 146
Calculus II - Concepts of calculus focusing on integration; topics include techniques of integration, applications of integrals, differential equations, infinite series, and polar curves.

All the courses are taught in Java.

My background: A few intro CS classes in high school and college (python, java, fortran...) and some numerical analysis courses, intro web dev courses during my MS in technical communication, 5 years working in software as a technical writer. I know an assortment of individual programming concepts, I can still throw together small programs like in my intro CS courses, and I know how to use Git on a basic level.

For the first year and a half, I was in a AS Digital Media program for graphic design, but enjoyed the programming classes so specialized in Web Development. When I thought it through, I decided that I wanted to go for Computer Science to become a software engineer who would work on systems.



I've only been in it for one semester, and am currently at 58 credits. It turns out that I'll only have financial aid until I hit my 90 credit mark. I only wanted to finish all of my math and science classes to get my AA degree, but have only finished College Algebra thus far and was taking Pre-Calc and Trig this semester. I only have a few classes left to finish my AS, and have finished most of them over the past semester which were Gen-Ed classes.  I feel like I should've listened to the people who told me I needed to continue pursuing a web development degree, and I feel like that's the only thing that can save me at this point. Because by the time I get to UCF like I wanted to, I'll have already have about 180 credits by graduation, and I'll lose financial coverage after that 180 mark, due to all the classes I took in that two-year degree program.

- And also job stability, a lot of students start in this subject, so there will be fewer jobs, and also, for example, when a doctor does 11 years of study he is unlikely to lose his job because his know-how is hard to have but in the case of computers I see lots of people who say learn python in 1 week or others who follow courses of a few months on the web.

You can see that my course doesn't have algorithms and data structures and looking around the web I m regularly finding that employers are generally keen on these two aspects. If I do main computer science degree then data structures and algorithms ARE included in the second year. 

Should I be worried? Should I switch over to just computer science? Will mathematics + computer science give me more opportunities than just computer science within the IT industry? If I start learning data structures and algorithms, will it take a long time? If so can you please point me in some directions? 

I m an total noob in this sector, I will start watching MIT open lectures on this and I have the book introduction to algorithms but to be honest I m finding it quite difficult to understand and would like something easier to slowly building up the basics.

 I'm a uni student and will be finishing this upcoming spring. I went for our game programming major in the engineering department because it seemed like fun and they also said that it was equivalent to the computer science program just geared more towards games so that you have chances of getting hired in other companies and not just gaming companies. Well it wasn't until last year that I realized this was a slight overstatement and it definitely does not leave you prepared to take a job outside of games and quite frankly leaves a pretty nasty knowledge gap that can make it hard to get a job in game companies. To try and make myself more appealing to companies outside of games (but also more appealing to game companies) I decided to take some courses off of our pure CS curriculum. The only classes I am missing are Calc 3, Intro to Probability theory and Statistics, Operating Systems, Algorithm Analysis, Computational Models, Comparing Programming Languages, Intro to compiler design to be considered pure CS. Sadly, I can't take them all but I can take a few of them and I have an idea of what I want to take I just want to get advise from people who have more experience. 

Of these classes  I figured I obviously shouldn't take calc 3 since It's something I can easily learn on my own (I also really like calculus). I am already taking probability theory and stats because it counts as an elective for my major and a general education requirement and from what I've noticed it's pretty applicable to games.  

Of the remaining classes I can only take 3 and I decided to go with Operating Systems because the professor also taught my advanced programming class and he was wonderful and gave so many meaningful assignments and great advice for programming; his teaching is really high quality. Aside from that it's an OS class and just about everything has some sort of OS running. I also decided to take Algorithm analysis because as the title suggests it deals with analyzing algorithms (mathematically) and methods for creating them.  It also covers space complexity (I only learned time complexity). Algorithms are really important in computers so I figured this class is a must. The third class I want to take is compiler design mainly because it sounds interesting and the more I use all these fancy compiles the more I want to learn about them.  

Reasons I didn't pick computational models and comparing programming languages:  

Computational models seemed more of a class focused on theory and academia (if that makes any sense) and as I have no interest of pursuing a master (at least for now) I felt like I won't need this class as much (also I don't think I can take it due to schedule conflicts). The class covered things such as P-NP, turring test, church-turing thesis, pumping lemmas, grammars, etc...

Comparing Programming languages is literally what it sounds like. According to some friends of mine the professors that teach the class all teach it nearly identical and they  teach some old (slightly outdated languages/ languages you will probably not see ever) and you learn the reasoning and theory behind creating the language. You also learn the differences in programming languages/ styles such as functional, OOP, etc.... according to most CS majors I've talked to, this class is kind of a waste of time.

What can she do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9ah5k8/my_girlfriends_coworker_is_an_awful_coder_and/,saltshakercat,1535303598,"Hi guys. So everyone in this post (me, her, the coworker) is 20/21 and a junior in college. She works for a MechE lab doing computer science work, so her boss isn't much help because he doesn't know much of anything about CS. 

My girlfriend just started coding last year. When she started working at this job, she didn't know what OOP was. She's come a huge way in a short time and really has a knack for this stuff. I'm really proud of her because it can be hard to play catchup.

Anyways, onto this coworker. So since she is new to programming, he did most of the coding on their project at the beginning and she did most of the algorithm work. Now that she is in her junior year and knows what she's doing, she's been contributing more. She's thinking of submitting the project to a journal and writing a paper to go along with it, and has been looking back through the code to make sure it is journal ready. 

Her coworker's code is AWFUL. He also kept moving the code to his private repo instead of the lab repo (why?), overwriting her changes and he made over 200 commits in only a couple months (worth noting that this project only has like 3 files...wtf dude). She asked me to look it over because she wanted to refactor it and wanted to know if I had any input. I swear, she has to rewrite all of it. I'm not even being dramatic, the two paragraphs goes through what I mean but is totally skipable if you don't care, it's mostly me being sad about this code. 

So as part of their code they have two objects that I would assume would inherit from something. Like Shape --&gt; triangle, square. He has one class, Shape. He has you pass the type (triangle vs square) into the constructor, then if type = triangle, declare one set of variables, otherwise, declare a different set. This class has two methods, one method for each type. If you call a method on the wrong type, it throws a runtime error. WHAT.

In the main code, he also iterates through a list AFTER clearing it. Why? He calls a function on each list item with the word ""get"" in the title. That function doesn't return anything, or use pass by reference. That function ALSO calls a ""get"" function that returns nothing and doesn't edit any values. Huh? 

So yes. The code is a mess and looking at it made me want to cry. No journal would ever accept this in the state it's in and she honestly needs to probably start from scratch. He didn't even follow the algorithm. This coworker though, thinks he is gods gift to the earth. He insists on having all the code on his private repo, instead of a lab repo where everyone has equal access. The prof even told him to have his code in the lab repo, but he moved it back to his! What! He doesn't comment or document properly, and whenever she tries to make (much needed) changes he commits and overwrites them. He also purposely leaves her out of email chains concerning the project (even though it was her project to begin with, and her idea), and talks to the professor behind her back. To the prof's credit, whenever he conveniently forgets to use the CC button he brings her back in, and the next reply she's out again. **Another thing - he doesn't even work at the lab anymore!!** She can't talk to her boss about him, because he's not his boss anymore! He told her and the prof that he ""doesn't have enough time"" to do the paper, and that she will have to do it on her own. **But he's still happily making changes to the repo (that he won't move off his account), usually like one line change / commit. My gf is already planning to do a total refactor of the code, but we're afraid that he'll just undo the changes**. My dad (in the CS industry for years) thinks we should talk to the prof and get the coworker kicked off the project, or fork the repo into the lab repo and ignore his changes from now on. My gf hates confrontation and thinks this is ""too aggressive"". I think that she should basically tell him to screw off, fork the repo without him being a contributor and redo the code properly from scratch.

Thanks.** 

I was originally going to ask this in Yahoo Answers, but it's too long, and Quora won't let me add details to my question, and since this is a computer science Reddit, I figured I would give it a shot.

&gt;I love computer science and programming! I've been programming since I was about ten. I fell in love with computer science and programming. I'm fifteen now, which means soon I'll be looking for a job. I would like to go into something computer-science related, and have for a long time.   
&gt;  
&gt;I have a okay base of understanding. I try and branch out to have an ""advantage"". I know mostly high-level things, like Java, web-development languages. I am learning C and some x86\_64 assembly, and things like that.   
&gt;  
&gt;I take courses online at Udemy, since I love their classes, and unfortunately high school and middle school computer classes teach ridicules basic things ( even programming classes ), so they're really not much use for me. To actually get a job, I understand I'd have to take collage classes in the field, but I still like preparing BEFORE that, so it's not cramming and memorizing code, and then I also know what is ( and isn't ) important. Case in point, my computer teacher also taught Java, so we'd look at code together if she couldn't find the answer, and she had to teach ... switch statements. I never use them ( well, almost never ), and find them almost completely useless.   
&gt;  
&gt;Always, a little off topic. That was mostly just background. My main question is this; right now, what are some classes would you recommend I take. Material I should study, languages it would be good to learn. Then, once I graduate from high school, what classes should I take?   
&gt;  
&gt;My grades aren't the best, but not because of lack of knowledge, more because of ....... ""laziness""? I don't want to take very easy and basic classes ( if possible ), because they're much harder to sit through, because it's relearning everything I've already done. . Thanks, and so sorry for this mountain of text. Haha.

I really do love computer science. It's what I do most of my time. I work primarily in Java, because I worked in it for a long time, and I gradually got better. I really only recently **understood** what interfaces were; they confused the heck out of me before. I started learning it, honestly, because of Minecraft. I wanted to understand how Minecraft worked, so I began working in Java. Even though my goal hasn't been reached ( looking at the MCP, I'm a confused still, because of the largeness and complexity of it ... although diagramming it all out may help... ), I still use Java constantly, and try to avoid using other languages, when I can, because of my comfort with Java.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for this wall of text. I just want to know what you guys have to say with that. I've occasionally done small freelancing projects before. Usually, they don't know of my age, but still say my work is okay. I program for fun, hobby, and real-life use. I use programming to help explain complex math topics, create demonstrations for science, and have fun. I use Roblox for fun programming, Java for math programming, and Arduino ( and I think C++? ) for science ( and sometimes Java/Roblox too ).

I've been putting a lot of thought into going back to school for a computer science degree recently and wanted to get your take on the  worth of the degree. I failed out of college the first time I went and  found my own way for a few years. The last few years I got lucky with  some good connections and was able to get into a job where I learned Windows/Linux server management, scripting (powershell, bash, python)  and cloud technologies among other things.  


I've moved onto another company making  more money and working with the cloud, but I don't feel as motivated  working with infra. Feel I would be much happier in software  development. Always have loved the scripting aspects of my job, and feel  I would enjoy development much more. I could probably bust it out and  do a job change with another entry level position, however I want to  learn the fundamentals of comp sci from a solid university. Possibly get  a masters years down the line. Would this be worth it for me? Feel I  have enough saved to take time off to accomplish this. Would I be more valued in the industry with a solid infra/cloud background?  


Asking here because I have gotten a lot of  mixed feedback from friends/family/mentors. However I feel this would  benefit me more in the long run since I would be learning from the  ground up, not on the fly like I have with all of my infrastructure stuff.

Anyways, mid explanation, I realized I simply had to change a typo from j to i in one of my loops and the program worked flawlessly and he finally shut up... 

Then another time I had someone helping me, and they began to type some code out for me. I saw them type n/ instead of \n but I figured they catch the error once they ran the code. They run the code, catch the error and say next time make sure YOU write \n instead of n/. I wanted to throw my computer at this person...

Long story short: I was depressed throughout high school/college, was majoring in Biomedical Science but then switched to Biology in hopes that I would graduate sooner. I did not want either degrees, but my parents were paying for college so I followed orders. 

After I graduated, I tried becoming a PTA (physical therapy assistant) but soon realized that was a bad idea. I started studying for the GRE but I had no idea which masters program I wanted to go in. My gpa was really low (3.0) and I had no idea how I was going to get recommendation letters. It felt like a dead end so I stopped studying and started looking for jobs. I looked at lab jobs, environmental jobs, and nothing seemed promising. Hours were awful and pay was always really low. (I work at a grocery store so I wasn't *that* desperate to find job). 

I don't know if I'm coming across picky and entitled, I'm definitely not. I just wanted to find a career path because I was really lost during this time.

So this is where I started to learn java. Surprisingly, I really enjoy it. The feeling of passing tests that you were struggling on is the best feeling. I'm currently learning through the MOOC classes. I'll be starting OOP part 2 soon. 

I need advice on which route I should go in. I know I'm in the very beginning stages of programming and I would appreciate a reality check. Do I have to get a bachelors in CS?  Would getting a certificate in CS be enough? Do I need to pay for traditional classes? Would building my porfolio with projects even get me a job interview if I have no traditional CS experience?

Files have to be transferable at any given moment from the single user going in and out of the server. There does not have to be a preview of any of the files.

The problem I have is that the whole point of the project is that we have to do it using a language we don't know already, so I can't use Java at all. It's due in 3 weeks and I need a simple way to code this, there doesn't have to be much of a UI as long as the user can see the names of the files he's sending and receiving. 

My idea was to modify Linux to connect two PC's on separate networks as if they were on the same, however I don't know how complex it would be as it's written in C (not too hard to learn), but as I said there's only one month to learn and apply the method.

Pls send help &lt;3

Regards,
