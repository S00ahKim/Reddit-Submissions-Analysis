I'm currently a student at University of Sydney. I'm currently taking majoring in Political Economy (ECOP) and Government &amp; IR (GOVT). I was hoping to drop GOVT and pick up CS. However, I'm worried about math. I'm also thinking whether it would be a wise choice to do so or should I just learn CS outside of class?

I was hoping to pick up CS as a backup after grad and if I'm interested I'll probably further my studies. I only have 2 years left and I would like to do an honours in ECOP but GOVT can take a pass if I take up CS. Worth it or should I just study by myself online? Is CS on a degree better than no CS on a degree?",6,1

I took two C classes during my senior year in High School as well.  Currently I am taking Intro to Perl, as the third C class was full before I was able to register.  I have worked with C++ a small amount, having made a small chess game using SFML - not much, I know.

The more I read about college advice, regrets, and general success, the more I've come to realize that I absolutely need an internship to secure a future for myself outside of college.  The problem is: every internship opportunity I see on the web or on flyers at my school require, at the very, very least, 2+ years of study; in fact, more often than not they require a degree.  These kinds of expectations discourage and, frankly, terrify me.

My question is: what should I do to find an internship given my relatively amateur experience?  If improbable with my experience, what should I do to prepare an appealing resume? 

Thanks for your time.",4,2

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota in Duluth, and I got my BFA in Theatre Design and Technology. While I do enjoy doing theatre design, it's a very difficult field to get started in, especially with student loans hovering over my head. I've always had an interest in CS, I've developed a few theatre related android applications, I host a few websites for friends on my VPS, etc. Given how much fun I have when I finally get some program/server setup to work, I probably got my degree in the wrong field.

Now I live in California, where I got a job doing tech support related to theatre technology, and it's only got me wishing I had a degree in CS more. I support someone else's product, and wish I could pop into the source code to fix some things that people complain about. 

I've been looking for schools to apply to in CA (preferably in the LA region, since that's where I am currently), but found that most schools don't accept a student applying for a second baccalaureate. First off, why? It feels like I've been punished for sticking with it and finishing my first degree. Secondly, are there any schools around that people are aware of that are still great institutions to learn this stuff from, but actually accept students who have completed a first degree?

TL;DR - Any good CS schools near LA that take 2nd Baccalaureates?",11,0
21,2013-11-23,2013,11,23,6,1r8veo,Worried about low grade in 'Theory of Computing' class...,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1r8veo/worried_about_low_grade_in_theory_of_computing/,Muff1ns,1385157006,"hello comp sci redditors! i'm currently a sophomore CS major, and have always loved math and computers since a young age. so far i have taken up to Calc 1 for my math courses and got an A in both Pre-Calc and Calc 1, and i will be taking Calc 2 next semester. For my CS courses, I have taken Intro to Comp Sci, Data Structures, and am finishing up GUI Design this semester. I have also gotten As in all of my CS courses.

now, my biggest issue is my ""Theory of Computing"" course, which is required for my major. while i have received consistent As in pretty much all of the classes i have taken so far in college, this course has been my biggest weakness. some things that we have learned are regular expressions, finite automata, context-free languages, chomsky normal form, etc... and for some reason i have failed to understand about 90% of the material we have covered. it is not just me, either, but the majority of the class is near failing. my professor is just not very good at presenting the material, but i also feel like i may have taken the course without the proper prerequisites. 

so, my question is just how important will this theory course be when it comes to my career? i plan on being a programmer, perhaps something with app design since i've really loved learning Objective-C(iPhone apps) this semester in GUI Design. i'm somewhat of a perfectionist, and i know i will be lucky to get a C as my final grade in this course unless he curves the grade immensely which is really disappointing for me. i fear that not knowing this material may affect my abilities in other courses, and unfortunately this same professor will be teaching Discrete Structures next semester as well (he is the only professor to teach Theory of Computing and Discrete Structures, so i have no choice but to take these required CS major courses with him to graduate) so i fear that i will be heading down a slippery slope with this major :(",5,0

This is a wall of text post about my struggles in life that I'm giving to the kind folks at r/computerscience so that you redditors can give me some perspective and guidance and maybe share some of your own hardships.

I was a single child with a single mother who passed away in 2007. I was left with her house and a mortgage to pay during the big recession. Instead of selling it for an unsatisfactory price and continuing with school I dropped out of High School my senior year and started working manual labor jobs to afford the mortgage since it appeared to be the better financial choice to hold on to my house. I was weak in Math back in high school and not really trying in my studies anyways due to my mother's health. I never really tried in school during my life anyways... I always had my personal problems. I was always struggling with personal issues of having a drunk abusive father who was always in and out of Jail.

After working manual labor jobs for a couple years I eventually worked up to $15/hr as I found that a company I was working for found that they benefited more from my IT skills than my facilities maintenance abilities. I got lucky as our CEO retired and my boss who previously did most of the IT moved on to a better and higher paying position. I took over part time as an IT Support Specialist, had my mortgage readjusted and started going back to school in 2010.

After having a dose of ""Real World"" slamming me in the face so unexpectedly I definitely don't want to major in anything less than something that will directly get me a job right out of college. Sociology, Psychology and Earth Science are pretty interesting but there's no way in fuck I'm going to get myself into more debt to get a degree that's anything less than a meal ticket for the rest of my life. I have the experience in Computers, I live in the Silicon Valley, my friends all work in the computer industry... I want to fucking study computer science.

By attending 6-8 units per semester for the past 3 years I have all my General education and non-major coursework out of the way. Now I just need to do Math. After barely scraping by Algebra 1 with a D in High School and dropping out of Algebra 2 I'm finally finishing my Algebra 2 community college course this semester. So far as long as I keep my head up these next few weeks I should get an A. However, it's fucking HARD for me. I have my girlfriend helping/tutoring me all the time when I'm stuck. I'm doing almost every problem and exercise in the book instead of just doing the assigned work load and I'm trying SO HARD just to get this 'A' in a remedial math class that most of you probably breezed by as 15 year olds. I feel it's a huge joke for a 24 year old to be struggling with such a minor math class. (apparently this algebra 2 class is pretty hard though, systems of linear inequalities, introductions to summations, formulas circles, elipsses, and hyperbolas, logs, inverse functions)

Given all these math struggles, and lack of math experience, and lack of schooling in math how hard will it be for me to continue through this Math conquest and Juggernaut my way through to 3rd year calculus, vectors, linear algebra and differential equations? Can I do it? How hard will it be? Where can I expect troubles?

Am I the only aspiring computer science major who's been completely math-tarded attempting to forgo these math classes?
