I hope this will be an informative discussion. Firstly, I am Turkish citizen and currently a student at university in computer engineering department. 

Unlike most of countries, Turkey didn't give attention to computer industry. Turkey still have ""computer engineering"" departments instead of ""computer science"". Although the curriculum of engineering is based on computer science. Student profile is worst.-Also I need to mention that this is not only my opinion or observation, many people can agree about this situation.- Most of them are in university because they use social media or play games more than most of people. Some students have the ""I'm gonna hack the FBI or CIA or some Facebook accounts"" mentality. 95% have no coding experience. While the teachers makes us doubt they actually know what they are teaching. -For example if I want my programming languages teacher to explain why did we chose x function instead of y function, he replies : I do not know, I've learned that way-

So you can imagine how bad is this. I see myself as lucky because all of my family is in the software industry. My dad is an electronic and communication engineer, he used to work on first ADSL modems in our city and has lots of knowledge in network and later he started to web development. His cousin -I call him uncle btw- high school grade self-taught programmer and he is pretty good at his job (He went to few countries in Europe to work, came back home after 10 years). 2 of my cousins are software engineers, one of them is at Snapchat, other one is at Amazon. So I feel like I've got almost unlimited source and help.  My dad taught me HTML when I was 11. My uncle bought me PHP book, after that taught me the basics of C language. I learned 'a lot'. At least I thought I learned a lot. Everyone around my age, even some university student had no programming language knowledge like mine. As time pass by I realize that the things I know is so little, so little that it's not even enough to finish any project. Then I find myself on Reddit to dig up some information. I've been in some subs but people over there called me arrogant and some names but the thing is how could I knew that some kids in US or anywhere else can start learning programming when they are young and became programmer when they're 14-15? People in here almost have no opportunity start programming earlier than university. I started to learn as soon as possible and I'm still learning as much as I can. 

I just finished my first year in university. I'm looking for internships. In Turkey big companies tend to take students from top 5 universities because of their prestige. Other places takes you if you know someone who works there. Well I don't know anyone who works in a software company. I try my chance on international companies like Amazon but most of companies choose students from Schengen Area or US/Canada citizens. I'm well aware that these are just excuses but I feel lost for some time. I'm open to any advice.

I'm building a fairly large applicaiton that allows people to upload and consume audio data. So far, I'm just using a cheap Linode box for development, but I'm thinking about this from a point of view knowing that it will scale. There are tons of people interested and even if I only convert 25% of them I think I'll still be doing really well. So I'm designing with scalability in mind.

First, everything is built using python and boto3 for storage and sending sms notifications for verification of a number. Supervisord manages and handles UWSGI emporer which runs all of my services.

Services in this instance can be broken down into cms (for employees/me), API (for the IOS/android app), static (hosts static files for cms/web which can be cached behind varnish or something) and docs (probably going to merge with static). For my data storage I use postgresql for user information and storage of s3 metadata.
All of these services are stored in github in a private repo which is where I will be documenting release procedures. I use sqlalchemy so most of my database management is handled for me and I can easily have it update the tables on prod.

I am using sentry (not for prod), but for staging when I get to that point and for prod. This will agregate and report any errors. I've also set up a firewall that just blocks everything but http/ssh (so I can get in to do any work if I need to). When I release to prod I'll have a jump-box that is used for ssh and only allow that IP through.
I'm also using Jenkins to nightly run unit tests on the individual services (so mostly just API for right now).
I've got two main issues apart from whether or not anyone can recommend anything else that might make this better/easier to manage.
I don't have any background in devops, but my biggest concern right now is making sure that this is secure (are there good ways to test this) and determining whether or not I need a WAF and how useful that would be to set up during dev just so I can tune it.
My secondary issue is just that of migration. These are getting fairly complex and I'd like to be able to quickly role out new changes and deploy new servers. I've got everything documented and by following the instructions I can easily deploy a new server; all of the config files are also stored in another git, so that shouldn't be hard, I'm just trying to think ahead here.
Also, when it comes to a DBA prospective, how do people generally handle things like sqlalchemy? If I add a new column it will just call an altar statement, but are there any pitfalls to be aware of there?

I appreciate any information/advice that might be offered. I graduate next semester and just want to have something cool under my belt. I've done a lot of QA work previously and my background before that was mostly in systems security/performance, so I think I've mostly got that covered. Ultimately I'd love to put each service in its own jail and have nginx in another jail that can connect to them and serve as hosts, but I'm not really sure how viable that is and I would lose the ability to use emporer.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to any responses.",5,6

So where would i start? Algebra, calculus and build my way up to discrete math?

Also how important is it to have knowledge in computer science for a decent job perspective?

There are a set of pegs, numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each peg can have a connection to another peg with a rubber band.

Basically, the program is given an adjacency list with all of the pegs and the ones they connect to. The idea of the project is to come up with an algorithm that returns a permutation with the all of the rubber bands stretching the least distance.

It's my understanding that this program will take a long time to run. Our teacher implied that the algorithm should run multiple times to get the best answer; each result of the algorithm should improve the overall ""cost"". (The cost is the distance spanned by all of the rubber bands, measured in pegs. For example, a set of 5 pegs in numerical order that has one rubber band between peg 1 and 3 has a cost of 2).

I won't be able to take DS&amp;A until january because of the prerequisite for the class is the aforementioned compsci class but instead of waiting I was wondering if learning it by myself via a textbook would be possible. I heard that algorthims by sedgewick is a good book. Do you guys think it would be a good idea attempting to self teach via this textbook? Also I don't have access to good internet this summer so online video lectures are sadly out of the question.

I can guess my way through the quizzes, but I'm not understanding how the arguments fundamentally work. Here's the main one, a proof that the halting problem is undecidable:

*Prove*: The language consisting of all machine definitions &lt;M&gt; where M halts on an empty string ({&lt;M&gt; | M halts on an empty string }) is undecidable

*Strategy*: Reduce the language consisting of machine definitions &lt;M&gt; where M accepts its own definition ({&lt;M&gt; | M accepts &lt;M&gt;}) to it

*Code*:

    def R(M):
       def N(x):
          while not M(M):
             pass
          return True
       return N

I don't understand how the concept of reduction is demonstrated here. My understanding of reduction is that it's a relationship where for every item x in a set A there's a derivative item f(x) in a set B (and also where deciding f(x)'s membership in B is at least as hard as deciding x's membership in A).

However, I don't have a clue how the Python code portrays any of that. Admittedly I might be misrepresenting something here, but hopefully I've provided enough that someone can set me straight.",1,3

I plan on transferring to University of California, Santa Cruz within the next year, since I live in San Jose, CA, which is close by. 

&amp;nbsp

This past semester I passed data structures &amp; algorithms with an A, so programming is not a very big issue with me. Although, I must admit I'm not a great programmer, by far, and it takes me a while to learn things, but I try hard.

&amp;nbsp

Two majors at UCSC have caught my eye:

&amp;nbsp

[BA in Computer Science] (https://ua.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/CS_BA_16-17.pdf) (Includes Calc I &amp; II, discrete math, Linear algebra, etc) but I just dread some of the upper division courses and the capstone project or thesis option.

&amp;nbsp

Secondly, [BS in Technology &amp; Information Management] (https://ua.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/TIM_16-17.pdf) (TIM for short). Overall, it's certainly not a ""frowned upon"" or ""basic""  IT or IS degree (I have seen people on this sub say in previous posts that CS people don't respect IT or IS people) after viewing the course requirements. It includes taking up to Calc IV, discrete math, many economics courses, and all the very important foundational CS course like data structures &amp; algorithms, Computer systems and assembly, etc.

&amp;nbsp

I'm just so torn on the two majors. BA CS has many tricky/very time consuming upper division courses and a required senior capstone project or thesis. TIM is a jack of all trades master of none, with no large senior thesis or project and can provide other marketable skills. 

&amp;nbsp

I'm not 100% sure if I want to be a programmer, neither am I 100% I want to be in tech management. Most of all, I want a worthwhile degree that won't hold me back from being in tech or have me looked down upon.

&amp;nbsp

Which major should I choose?

I'm currently considering a path for a masters degree for next year but have a dilemma. There is the option of persuing a MBA, yet, I feel at odds about it. Since I'v been out of school I'v managed to teach myself the basic of a few computer languages being HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery(Javascript is huge, but eventually I'll get the hang of it and will expand to other languages). I'm satisfied in this area and would like to pursue a masters in an area of computer science. I would be satisfied with a path in computer science and feel the MBA path is the lesser meaningful path for me. The issue is that I have no background in computer science and am unsure of what to do to reach my goal. I have attempted to find other people who have succeeded in entering the computer science field with no background and how they obtained the education necessary to do it. No luck! I just committed to a new job for at least 2-3 years and finally have the time to pursue further education on the side. Any advice?

If you have any personal experience with how long it took you to learn the basics, do chime in as well.

I understand learning a language is an abstract concept as who and honestly say they know all the words of their mother tongue but I think you see what I mean.

By the way I am happily employed but simply want to learn Java as I think I would enjoy it.

When I look in the discussions for problems I'll sometimes see 1 liner solutions.  Which at first I thought was really cool and genius to be able to work the language like that.

The more I thought about it though, in terms of writing code for a company, I'm not sure that this is a good solution.  At a company good code would be code that is both efficient and maintainable.  These one liner solutions may be smaller code blocks, but they can also be much harder to read, especially for freshers at a company and reduce maintainability.

So my question is, while condensing the code can be a genius manipulation of the language being used, is it really good practice to do it that way?  assuming the same efficiency in both scenarios.",3,8

This isnt relevant but I must emphasize that this note was incredibly important.

Unfortunately, before pasting I accidentally copied other text therefore, seemingly, erasing that copy from the clipboard memory. Although, it seems like it would be a reasonable feature for iOS to retain a small clipboard memory (maybe 3) for such emergencies after extensive research and consultation it appears that no such data exists. I have given them feedback about this because the memory cost is completely outweighed by the potential user benefit for retaining such data.

I have tried every conceivable avenue for recovery barring a 3rd party program.

My iCloud backup had been turned off for 3 months (all the writing was done over the course of the last couple weeks)

My last iTunes backup was before the note(s) were written.

The Apple representatives were able to recover the ghosts of the notes that had been deleted via cut paste (minus the final paste), meaning they were the notes in their final version which were blank.  The Notes program automatically deletes a note that has no text. The recovered files had no action history, meaning I could not to the shake-phone-undo function to go back to before I had deleted the text.

So. My question is. Is it even theoretically possible for any 3rd party program to recover these old notes. Is there any trace of them anywhere out there in the ether, any foot prints of them, anything. Or has it vanished from the face of the earth.

If anyone knows please let me know.

Much appreciated.

I am a PhD student in Chemical Engineering (got my chem engineering bachelors already) and am realizing that this field is not for me.

A) Get a Master's in Chem Eng.  next spring, then get a job related to computer science, and come back in a few years for my PhD.
B) Apply for PhD. programs in Computer Science this winter so I can get my master's next spring and jump right into my new field.

In terms of my Masters work and personal life, I've self-taught myself a few languages and my Master's thesis involves generating a constraints-based computer model to predict cellular metabolism, so it is entirely computational.

Skip the middleman, there are lots of folks willing to interview you for free or at least cheaper. AMA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6j9iln/i_was_an_mock_interviewer_for_gainlo_a_service/,NeedsMoreFlow,1498327014,"About me: My day job is working for a big, well known tech company as a software engineer and have ran 127+ coding and system design interviews for my company. As a way to try to make some side income I've tried some random stuff out including being a mock interivewer for Gainlo.

I've been an interviewer for this company/guy for a couple of weeks to test the waters and see how it operates. The focus of this service is to make it possible for people to get interviewed by engineers working at large, well-known tech companies like Google/Amazon/Microsoft/etc and get honest feedback without any risk. The person/entity/group behind Gainlo, ""Jake"" ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-cook-259bab101/)), acts as the middleman for matching people up and charges a fee of anywhere from $100-200+. **I don't recommend it.**

I had a friend reach out for a quote for a 1-hour coding interview for a junior position and was asked for $150 to be matched with an interviewer with no real verified identification. The verification process for these interviewers is that they ask interviewers for a LinkedIn profile. Not only is this something you could easily do yourself, but it's just as easy for the interviewer to fake their credentials and pretend to be a developer at a big company by citing someone else's LinkedIn profile.

For reference, I was being given $40-50 per session (45m interview, 15m verbal feedback, ~30m for written feedback) as a senior developer. I don't know what other interviewers were being given.  They are taking a huge cut for playing matchmaker when people could instead be getting interviews for free or at least get bids on Reddit forums for mock interviews.

If you're not ready for mock interviews, there's so many free practice coding exercises available like LeetCode, InterviewCake, and HackerRank to name a few.

However, now that I have completed my R script that handled tons of dataframes and numeric and string manipulation, I was told to translate it all into PHP. Would doing this make the script run faster, or would calling the R script to run via PHP exec(), storing the strings as PHP variables, and then inserting them in the PHP arguments, slow down the overall speed?

I am a second year CS student (just completed and did well in Data Structures, discrete math, calc 2, computer org etc)

I got an interview for a job that I didn't really meet the minimum quals for, but my passion landed me that interview. It was an entry level ""bug fixer"" job. I did not receive that position but instead got a second interview for a full time developer position as one of the Developer team leads saw something in me.

I did that interview and got a call that night with an offer. I am nervous that I won't be able to live up to expectations. Again, I am not a degree holder and I may be the only developer there without a degree. The fact is that they could have hired developers for that position with a degree.

Granted, my starting pay is in the bottom 5 percent of developers. (Not complaining it is very good money, more than ive ever made before, as well as excellent benefits). It is a satisfying amount for me.

I guess I just want to meet expectations, and be able to contribute to the company. I don't want to be a liability, what could I expect day 1 as a new Software Developer. I believe their primary languages used are Java with SQL. What could I start learning on my own to better prepare. TBH I have limited knowledge in database programming. I have been watching syntax videos on how SQL is written, and that's all fine but I just do not know where or how to apply these concepts.

Anyway, just nervous. They obviously have high expectations, and I hope to meet them. I LOVE programming, it is my passion I didn't start because of the money. I am very professional and positive even under stressful conditions, as well as being teachable. I believe I demonstrated all of the qualities in my interviews. I just hope that I can learn the needed tools and concepts well enough to ""earn"" my paycheck and make contributions to the team.

Is it common to feel like this?",5,2

I have always had a interest in computers and technology. But I need a few questions answered before jumping straight into a major.

1. My Technical college offers Cyber Security associates degree (certifications), also offers associates in programming, and then the University offers Computer Science I have a interest in all 3 just having a hard time deciding. Getting my cert/associates in cyber security what are my chances landing a job with just that as my education background/salary the same with associates in programming what are the chances landing a job with just a associates in programming/salary? Because I already know computer science is the best way to go just haven't narrowed the other two out need advice. 

2. I know a lot of you are majoring in Computer Science so I would like to ask what are the prerequisites you take before the core classes? And what are the core classes? My University doesn't show all the classes on the website. This is my University Computer Science core classes it shows is that all the classes? https://www.coastal.edu/computing/cs/

3. I'm confident I can pass everything in computer science the only thing that worries me a bit is the Maths. Math wasn't my best subject growing up unfortunately I would like to know what kinds of maths will I be learning and are they brutally hard? 

I'm just really stuck at the moment need some advice from you guys thanks! ",4,4
256,2017-6-29,2017,6,29,12,6k5w80,Big O Notation Question.,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6k5w80/big_o_notation_question/,GiveEmMoZo,1498708562,"Hello CS verse, I started programming about 9 months ago (first language was R for those who give a crap), and I'm trying to learn Big O Notation and algorithm efficiency this summer before my Algos class, and figured the best way to kind of grasp an understanding of this would to think of two algorithms to solve the same problem, and determine which one would be more efficient and still cover the problem completely. So if you guys would kind of check over my work here, I'd love it! (NOT homework lol).

Problem: So I have two groups of data, say Group A and Group B. These groups have coordinates in 3D. The size of these groups don't have to be the same. My task is to grab every point within a certain distance of any point on the opposite group. (Let's say the distance cap is 15, I would need every point in A that is within 15 of any point in Group B, and every point in group B that is within 15 of any point in Group A).

First algo: This was kind of a brute force approach where i took the distance between every point in A, and every point in B, created a massive dataframe, and then went through and grabbed the values that were less than or equal to my distance cap. I then ran filtered the data to delete duplicate entries. 
My Big O Guess: n^2 for the computing, n for the filtering. This pulls every point needed, but I feel like it would take a while if the groups were very large?

Second Algo: Take the first element in Group A, compare it to every thing in Group B, if it fits the cap, remove the item from group B, if there is ANY match that the entry in A for the cap with in B by the end of the run, remove the entry from Group A. Complete this process for every item in A. 
My Big O Guess: n^2? I feel like this algo would be more efficent with speed, but I'm not sure it would pull every point. My thinking is, if the distance is satisfied once, there is no need to keep looking at the point, so the algo should speed up as it goes on, since there are less elements to compare... but like I said, I'm a newbie to programming and Big O especially, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks everybody!

One thing I recently realized is that if unifications are modeled using homotopies, then unified variables are not just ""equal"" but that there can be a nontrivial topology to the unification.  For instance a transitive chain of unifications (A=B AND B=C), and likewise a star (A=D AND B=D AND C=D) can be contracted to a point, but a circular loop of unifications (A=B AND B=C AND C=A) has the topology S1 (the unit circle) so it is NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME PROGRAM as the first two examples!  I'm convinced this has exciting implications for logic programming, I just... can't quite figure out what they are.  Can anyone take a guess at what operational or semantic effects different topologies of unifications could or should have on a logic program?  Or better yet, how can we give the distinction meaning, either for the user or for the implementation?",2,10
