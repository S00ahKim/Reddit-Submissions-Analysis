I'm senior at a UC school and I'll be graduating in the spring with a BS in mathematics. My original plan was to go to graduate school for math but I've come to realize the job prospects aren't exactly what I'm looking for so I've become interested in pursuing alternate masters programs.

I'm heavily drawn towards computer science as it's very similar to math (essentially the same thing), but I just don't have the knowledge base required to enter these programs. Now I do have a lot of transferable skills but I really only know a basic amount of programming such as basic Python and C++. My current university does not allow outside majors to take comp sci so it's a bust.

So I suppose I have a few questions. Is it reasonable to self-study/take open courses from local universities to achieve a comparable degree of competency to that of a Bachelors in Computer science ? I was planning to take a year off, move back home (sucks but hey sometimes you gotta do it) and try to find internships or anything while studying for the GRE and learning various comp sci topics. Will I run into any issues? What do you guys recommend?

Software engineer here...
About a year ago, my team got some new machines that were more powerful than what we had.  The intent was for them to be development machines.  Between working in the office and working from home, I realized my home computer was WAY faster at building code, and... everything else, in general.  

My work computer is a Dell T320 Tower Server:  
---  
Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard  
Intel Xeon CPU E5-1410 v2 - http://ark.intel.com/products/67417/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-1410-10M-Cache-2_8-GHz  
48 GB RAM (Don't know exact specs)  
2TB 7.2K RPM SATA 6Gbps 3.5in Hot-plug Hard Drive (I think)  

I installed my old graphics card, since it came with a crappy one.  
Sapphire Radeon HD 6870 - http://pcpartpicker.com/product/Vqzv6h/sapphire-video-card-100314vxsr  


My home PC is custom built, mostly for gaming:
---  
Windows 10
Intel i5-3570k - http://ark.intel.com/products/65520  
Asus P8Z77-V motherboard - http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/P8Z77V/  
Radeon R290 - https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121842  
Corsair Vengeance 16GB RAM (2x8GB), 240-pin SDRAM DDR3 PC3 12800 (1600 MHz) - http://www.corsair.com/en-us/vengeance-16gb-dual-channel-ddr3-memory-kit-cmz16gx3m2a1600c10  
Samsung 840 Evo SSD  

The following are common activities I do on both machines:  
1. Developing (same IDE, same codebase)  
2. Building (same exact codebase, running mostly ant targets and RPM builds)  
3. Browsing internet on firefox.  

In all cases, the PC at work is definitively slower.  Browsing different code modules in the IDE (IntelliJ) is sometimes laggy since we have about 200 java modules.  But it is almost unbearably laggy on the work PC.  A full rebuild takes up to 30 minutes or more on the work PC, but takes only about 5-10 minutes on the home PC.  Firefox is extremely slow on the work PC when rendering video or PDFs.  No slow-downs whatsoever on my home PC.  I have about the same number of tabs opened on both.  

Would anyone know why there would be such a stark difference?  

Thoughts I had:  
1. CPU difference?  For whatever reason, I had the impression the Xeon processors were put into servers cause they were faster/better in some way.  And aren't they usually priced higher?  
2. Is it the OS?  Is the Windows Server OS not optimized for UI usage and coding?  
3. Hard drive?  SSD vs. HDD?  But this shouldn't affect build speeds.  

Besides, all this seems somewhat negligible to me.  

Edit: HDD, not Sata  
Edit edit: No anti-virus/malware on it.  Installed the OS from scratch myself.  ",8,7,False,self,,,,,

My degree was a mix of business classes, project management, SAP, simulation, statistics, using Excel solver, Minitab, R, etc...

It's a long story, but I plan on getting a CS degree immediately after this (some of my electives are CS major courses so that works too). I don't like the idea of spending years in school for a second degree so I'm trying to figure out what I want to do here. My options are something like this:

- 3 year BCS (13 courses left)
- 4 year BCS (21 courses left)
- 4 year BSc in CS (more courses than the BCS)

Is a general BCS degree not going to be adequate to jump into the CS workforce as a developer? My parents were wondering if there was a way for me to take prereqs and do a master's degree in CS instead, and they have a point. It looks like my university requires a 4 year cs degree for master's admission, but tuition for the master's program is only $2500 a term... Are there universities in Canada that don't require a 4 year CS degree for admission? Is it even necessary?

My current plan was to get the 13 courses done for the BCS within a year.

I'm a second semester college junior, and last semester i declared my major in computer science. I never knew what I wanted to major in; I just knew that I was good with math so it had to be something in that range. 

I didn't grow up having an interest in computers so I don't have a well rounded knowledge of them currently. So I went into this major almost blindly (I'm not technologically impaired but I'm no genius either). Being the shy girl that I am, its hard enough for me to talk to people. So when everyone else in my classes seem to be extremely tech savvy it's very intimidating and makes me feel so inferior. 

I do enjoy learning coding and I am definitely interested in learning how the inner mechanisms of a computer work, but I don't know if it was a bad idea for me to choose this major when I don't have a strong background in computer knowledge. I'm trying to learn and understand as much terminology and as many computer concepts as I can but I just feel so dumb compared to everyone else.

Can anyone offer any advice? It would be much appreciated!

I come to seek some advice on how to keep moving forward with my current study and career.

Some back story: I am a beginner at any programming, period. I am almost 29, and have been a cook/chef since I was 16. Currently, I hold an Associates in Culinary Arts and a Bachelors in Business Management. For a number of years I wanted to get into game development (no lectures on this field, please. I'll explain below), but for years was put off because of how people treated it.

So, last year, I finally got fed up with my current line of work and am currently getting an Associates in Computer Science (it is in game development, but at this point in life I am A-OK with just doing CS work in general if I never become a game dev.), but as the name states I feel like I am going backward. I am so novice at programming currently, (a little Python and HTML knowledge, currently enrolled in C++ and JS) that I have no idea where to even begin to start looking for employment. I have given myself a personal goal to be out of the kitchen environment sometime in the summer. What I am noticing in entry level positions, and even internships, are pursing 4yr bachelors in CS or having numerous years of experience in CS already. This is pretty disappointing to see, and disheartening. I enjoy what I am learning, and want to be good at it.

So, I have started my quest to exit cooking and find a entry level job somewhere. I feel I would learn a heck of a lot more once I got into a job somewhere, but I have zero clue how to start or where. My current jobs hours make study difficult, and my free time is so limited between work and study I can't just start making programs as some have suggested to me in person. That, and I'm pretty iffy on things still. 

Sorry if this seems all over the place. Thanks for any tips and advice in advance. ",3,11,False,self,,,,,

* I am a junior computer science major

* I am formerly a chemistry major

* This caused me to start on my computer science major pretty late (2nd semester of my sophomore year)

* After this semester I will have taken 4 computer science classes

And now I am wondering what I should do this summer. I have seen suggestions of undertaking an internship or REU will greatly impact your resume. However deadlines are approaching fast and I'm wondering if I am ""talented"" enough to do this. I wouldn't say I am a bad coder, but I only have a full year of coding under my belt and am by no means great at what I do.

So would internships/REUs even want me with my lack of experience? I also have to take at least one online class this summer to graduate on time. So is it possible to do an internship and take a class at the same time while keeping my sanity?

If I didn't do an internship, I'd probably just take the class and find a job for the summer, which is what I did last summer. But will not having an internship/REU severely hurt my chances of finding a career next year?

I don't know what career I want to be in. Let me explain. I like algorithms and big data. I really liked the concept of making things more efficient. Say for example like a job at Uber maybe making sure everybody gets the most efficient routes or something, or everybody gets the closest driver to them based on traffic and and if the drivers are currently on a one way street and they have to turn around... etc but I don't know, I think, that's going to take too much effort.

 I also wouldn't want to be a data analyst because I majored in computer science not math. I would like to use my degree to do some developing. I would like to be able to work from anywhere with a laptop by the way. This isn't negotiable for me. It's a big reason why I picked CS.

 After 5 years or so I would also like to have the option to be a product manager. I'm a natural born leader - but I like to solve interesting problems also while coding. .. just not that hard.

&amp;nbsp;

So to summarize all of that:

&amp;nbsp;

1. I like algorithms and making things more efficient - but a job title with that role specifically would be too stressful.

2. Data is cool and all but I didn't major in computer science to become a data analyst. I would of picked math, which is 100 times easier for me.

3. I want to be able to remote work and become a product manager in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

What do you guys think? By the way, I need to choose two of these electives. Which ones would you guys take if you were me? And by the way, do you guys think taking Linear Algebra will be beneficial in my career? In my school it's optional, but I'm taking it regardless. Still want to hear some opinions though... about my career specifically.

1. Extract claims from source text with document summarisation (and other ML) techniques.

2. Analyze how claims propagate through public media.

3. Given this information, produce metrics given certain criteria on the reputability of a given source. For example: sources that historically have produced verified information are to be considered more reputable. 

Finally, produce metrics for trustworthiness of new claims given reputability metrics of sources that present the claim.

There is an online textbook that explains things but it just seems like a bunch of words. I feel like when I look up definitions to help me it just brings up more definitions, but still I don't understand how to solve a very simple textbook problem. 




I didn't come into this discipline disliking it, but I have come to associate working on Comp Sci with looking at a simple problem in the textbook for 20 minutes and even doing a google search and thinking critically and still not knowing what to do. And then everytime I feel like crying, so I hate it now because of the feelings that I associate with it.




Anyway, I just want to understand this stuff and feel like I have done nearly everything I can. I don't like asking others/TAs/Professors for help because I feel like they expect me to have some baseline understanding and will just tell me ""well you need to understand this first"" or something else, which of course is what I don't understand. At this point it's a snowball because when I look at my textbook or labs or projects I know what is in store so I just feel bad. 




I feel like I have some sort of learning disability, I need some other way to get understanding I guess. 



**EDIT:** A few people have asked for an example of a problem and my thought process about it so I have it here: 

This program currently fails to compile because the parameters cannot be automatically converted to Double in the statement  tripleSum = item1 + item2 + item3;. Because TheType is bound to the class Number, the Number class' doubleValue() method can be called to get the value of the parameters as a double value. Modify tripleAvg() method to use the doubleValue() method to convert each of the parameters to a double value before adding them.


    public class ItemMinimum {

     public static &lt;TheType extends Number&gt; 
     Double tripleAvg(TheType item1, TheType item2, TheType item3) {
      Double tripleSum = 0.0;
      
      **tripleSum = item1 + item2 + item3;**

      return tripleSum / 3.0;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Integer intVal1 = 55;    
       Integer intVal2 = 99;    
       Integer intVal3 = 66;    
      
      Double doubleVal1 = 14.5;    
      Double doubleVal2 = 12.3;    
      Double doubleVal3 = 1.75;    

      // Try tripleAvg method with Integers
      System.out.println(""Items: "" + intVal1 + "" "" + intVal2 + "" "" + intVal3);
      System.out.println(""Avg: "" + tripleAvg(intVal1, intVal2, intVal3) + ""\n"");

      // Try tripleAvg method with Doubles
      System.out.println(""Items: "" + doubleVal1 + "" "" + doubleVal2 + "" "" + doubleVal3);
      System.out.println(""Avg: "" + tripleAvg(doubleVal1, doubleVal2, doubleVal3) + ""\n"");

      return;
       }
    }


So I tried to just do Number.doubleValue(item1) + Number.doubleValue(item2) and so on.... but it said that I cannot make a static reference to something non-static or something. So I looked up something on google about instances and I realized that I needed to create an instance of the Number class. So I did that, but I think I did it wrong, because then I got an error message that said the Number class was abstract. I know that abstract classes are kind of like *hypothetical* classes, that require classes that use their undefined methods to define them, but I wasn't sure how to apply that here.

I'm currently a CS student about a semester and a half into the program, in Intro to Computer Science II.  The entire program is taught in C++ and I'm doing pretty well.

I've recently decided I wanted to make an IOS app with an idea in mind.  However, I'm wondering if I should learn Objective-C or Swift.  I know Objective-C is more of a standard (and I assume closer to C++), but from what I understand Swift is growing in popularity and is designed to be easier and more streamlined for IOS/OS X development.  

To make things easier here's a list of questions given the above information that I have:
Which will I have an easier time learning
Which will be more useful in my career
Which has more resources available
How fast is Swift growing and how streamlined is it really
What are some good resources you guys could recommend for IOS development (tutorials, programs, etc.)

I'm new here, so apologies if I'm doing something wrong. (cross-post to /r/learnprogramming)

I've just completed coding a website. (I'd love for some feed back, it's on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheFirstQuestion/HelpMeWatchWho) if you're interested). I've been developing it on my personal computers using MAMP (on my Mac) and a LAMP stack (on my Linux laptop). As far as server-side technology goes, I use PHP and SQL. 

I don't really know how to publish by website to the public. I use GitHub Pages to serve a small static site, but my new site uses server-side stuff and is much more complex. I've got a lot of questions:

1. What hosting services are good (and cheap)? I've been looking at [HostGator](http://www.hostgator.com/), and it seems to have everything I need.

2. How much server configuration do I need to do? I run a small home server, so I'm not a total noob, but I wouldn't feel comfortable having to set everything up myself. (Also: my site depends on a config file for SQL located outside the web server for security. Will I have access to file locations that won't be open to the public?)

3. How do I get the files to my hosting service? Drag-and-drop, FTP...? (I'm guessing this depends on the service.) Is it relatively easy and fast to update the site?

4. Any other advice? I really don't know what I'm doing, so tips/tricks/etc. would be awesome.

I am currently in my final year of BSc Computer Science in Northern Ireland. My skills are in Java, WebDev including React, SQL and bits of scripting like Ruby &amp; Python. I was very lucky in that the company that I worked for in my year out (between my 2nd and final year) gave me the opportunity of a Graduate position in the company. I say that I am lucky because there are lots of students in my year still trying to get into graduate position and even students younger than us struggling trying to get a placement position.

This is where my idea comes in. I have purchased the domain PerfectPC.tech. I have a few ideas for the domain, but I am looking for roughly two other people to join me in the adventure of starting a successful site. I want to bring on fellow students to the projects because I feel like as students we need these kind of opportunities to put on our CVs and impress employers. I don't plan to do any interviews or anything like that, but I will be interested in your background i.e. what stage you are in your degree (maybe you're not even doing a degree at all!?), do you have any existing side projects as it is etc.

If you're out going, love programming and have that entrepreneurial/start up spark please send me a DM! I would appreciate in the DM if you included any ideas you have for the site already.

Thanks for reading, lets make something awesome!!

Now obviously there is no ONE language you should learn. Currently I've studied computer science at my university for about a year and a half (going on 2 years ) and in that time, they've introduced us to Java, Python, and basic HTML(without java integration). Now the stuff we do in the class varies from either modifying pictures, creating text adventures, or web scraping (which was a bitch). Granted, I never even touched a line of code until my second year of school. The classes get much more advanced and thorough, but I digress. I spend a lot of time just exploring the code and I've made some decent things myself. Like for instance I wrote a paycheck calculator in python which is surprisingly accurate. It accounts for taxes and overtime and other things like that. As well as object-oriented text adventures which are pretty fun. 

I understand there's all sorts of C languages I've yet to learn, as well as JavaScript and multiple others. My plan is that I'd like to go into the software engineering area for a while. Ideally I'd like to work with game developers at some point, but that to me would have to be farther down the road.

When I started at a University last semester, I found that my skills were quite a bit behind my peers and I was struggling hardcore. At the time my mind was far away from getting an internship this summer because I didn't even know if I would pass all my classes (which I did, thankfully).  
  
So, I have been researching things to do in order to get an internship and find that I don't really fit the preferred qualifications. My associates GPA was 3.5, but since I struggled in the beginning of last semester my overall GPA is  now 2.8 and my major GPA is 3.0. On top of that I haven't done any personal projects outside of course assignments. Looking around I see that personal projects and a high GPA are what companies are generally looking for.  
  
Also, before I started working towards a CS bachelors I was an AutoCAD technician in the construction industry for a few years. Should I bother putting this on my resume?

I assume this is because a mipmap LOD is chosen according to the height of the surface, so when the texture is applied to the surface the sides are stretched? (fig 1 on diagram)

If so, why not choose a mipmap that's the same width as a short rectangle? That way you are compressing the image vertically but horizontally it's the right size. Surely compressing an image is better than stretching it, or am I wrong? I would have thought there'd be less blur. (fig 2 on diagram)

It's so shallow and nothing to gain from it other than coding experience and sitting in front of the monitor sippin' on gin and juice.

Peers are developing in Javascript, C++, and I'm just a code monkey doing menial work. Can't fall behind; gotta keep up and keep ahead.

So, each day, I'll dedicate 2 hours on learning Impact.js, a $100 Javascript/HTML5-based game engine. I forgot most of my javascript, but I imagine it'll take just a day or two to relearn everything. It's going to be easy. The hard part would actually be coding the game using the said engine, but simultaneously that would be the most fun part. I don't care if the games are fun or not. The point is to create, create, and create. 

I'll also do some side projects, like my hobbies, such as building a youtube empire or producing music and getting a song/track on Billboard. Just to keep me sane and going.

Thanks for reading, I needed to get this off my chest, need someone to hear me out.

Anyway, cheerios! May you be blessed in life and in software.",1,3,False,self,,,,,

Unfortunately, I'm completely lost for ideas as to what to do it on.  I'm new to computer science (this is my first year studying it).  Ideas for topics, optionally accompanied by a brief description of the topic, would be **_greatly_** appreciated.  Thanks everyone!

Edit (clarification): The idea behind the seminar is that it's supposed to be some tool or technology that isn't introduced in the traditional CS curriculum, which would be helpful for a CS student.

Edit 2: Thanks for the help everyone!  I think I'm going to go with AI and its potential effect on society.",6,2,False,self,,,,,

Currently I've been learning fundamentals in Java so still rudimentary but I'd like to specialise towards areas that would benefit my employment opportunities. 

I specified being female in the title as I am aware there is a culture atm towards supporting women in CS (I personally view this as unfair to my male colleagues but this isn't the point of my question) so wonder if that should factor into my strategy (EG I'm aware there are awards specifically for female students.) 

Atm I find the java projects quite boring and am curious if anyone can suggest areas of CS I might find engaging. I specifically enjoy maths and logic.

Thanks for any suggestions.",25,9,False,self,,,,,
