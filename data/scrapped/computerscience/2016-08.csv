I will be attending UIC from Spring 2017. I deferred my admission into the College of Engineering: CS for one semester. I have to take the following class as I am newly declared CS major.

I have almost no experience in computer science but I was hoping I could study on my own for one semester while working to save up money for school. This is an introductory level class. I would like to know how I can learn the concepts from the class so I can save a semester and place out. 

The class is CS 111: Program Design I.

I would like to place into CS 141. Can you guys please help me out and look through the two links and help me with this situation. I was also wondering if the following eDx class covers the CS 111 Program Design I material and if I could place out of 111 by just following it to a T.

You only learn the how. You don't learn how to work in a team, how to identify problems in design criteria and how to manage time. You learn to write code, and learn about computers and that's it.

&gt;In SE, you do a variety of subjects which force you to work in a team and complete a set task. Ignoring all the learning stuff, as i stated above, there are only certain jobs an CS can do. Cs's generally can't work on critical systems, even some Se's only those who hold Ieng's or Ceng's (which is very important if you want to move up in $$). 

&gt;Basically, what i am trying to say is that SE is a far more practical degree. If you want to work on large complex systems with a team, become an SE, otherwise if you want to become your average coder, working on mid level systems, do a cs degree.

Curious to hear other's opinions on this. Obviously my main issue with this is SENG and CS degrees differ drastically across the nation and world. For example, at my uni the SENG and CS degrees are virtually the same so this 'difference' he's talking about doesn't really apply to my uni.

I keep telling myself before every semester begins that I'll do better than before. But after the first month or two, I get bored and just give up. I don't know what's wrong with me. Even in a shitty college with low academic levels, I can't even get a 3.5 or higher. 

I decided to transfer to a bigger University where I'll be dorming for the next 3 years. It has a higher academic level and it's obviously more expensive (3x the tuition). The campus is huge and textbooks are more expensive.

I have a BS in CIT but I literally have no special skills that can land me a well paying job. 

I know enough to get by at an entry level networking job or a helpdesk position (positions that require a AS or BS in a computer field, but don't necessarily require me to be savvy with every piece of software and hardware that the company uses), but I have no real experience in something like DB administration or business level networking, etc. 

Most of my classes seemed to be based around explaining core concepts but not a lot of hands on work. It seems as though they set it up so a specialization is chosen with a masters degree. For example, they teach you about the various IT concepts during the BS, and have you focus on a specific field for the masters (Masters in IT security, Masters in DB design and implementation, Masters in Computer networking)

I've bought a few books and tried to teach myself, but a lot of it requires me to have access to expensive software/hardware that I have no way to afford. I bought some cisco networking books, only to find out that they assumed I already had $100's worth of networking equipment.

So I guess my question is... is it worth it to go back to school in hopes of specializing in a field? Like maybe get my masters in DB administration or a certificate in Cisco networking, etc? 

Are any fields notoriously more difficult/tedious? I don't want to focus on something, just to find out there are no jobs or the jobs require 18 hour workdays or something. Coding is not my thing (maybe web programming.)

If it's not worth it, what would you recommend I do? ",8,5,False,self,,,,,

For example, this tech guy who came to install new RAM onto our computers, and he attempted to remove the HEATSINKS from the RAM modules, thinking it was part of the packaging. He also brought DDR3-ECC memory modules instead of the required DDR4-Non ECC memory modules, and had a hard time figuring out why the notches were different. I gave him a course on RAM modules and what PC3-XXXX and PC4-XXXX and ECC means.

Turns out he has a degree in Psychology and used to work at Home depot. I'm not trying to degrade him, not at all, everyone's just trying to survive and I respect that. But I thought even a beginner tech guy would know these things right? I figured I would be coming into the workforce not knowing anything, it's slowly seeming like the opposite. I am very humble, and I know that these people have experience I know nothing about so my goal is to take in as much as I can, given how fortunate I am to be able to be doing the things I am doing at my age. I mean I think out of the typical CS students I have always kind of been ahead of the game because I love computers but man, I can't even explain how I feel.

Basically it involves treating a list of numbers as a series of upwards and downwards shifts. For example 1 3 2 would be translated to up-down since from one to three there is an increase and from three to two there is a decrease. 

Every number in a list (excluding repeated elements) can be represented as a number from 1 to the size of the list, where this number represents its position in the ordered list. Therefore, any list of size n can be expressed as a series of numbers from the range 1-n. Given that there are n possible entries for the first element, n-1 for the second, n-2 for the third and so on, we see there are n! possibilities for a list of size n. These possibilities can then be grouped in terms of what up-down behavior they exhibit. 

3412 and 2413 can be grouped into up-down-up. 

Now that we have the permutations grouped by their behavior we find a specific transformation for each group so that the greatest variety of groupings is created after the transformation. A transformation in this context means shifting the indexes of the permutation and is written as a list of size n. For example, if we apply 3214 to the permutation 4213 then we get the permutation 1243. The first index becomes the first, the second becomes the second the first becomes the third and the fourth stays the fourth. In this example the permutation 4213 had rule down-down-up and after the transformation changed to up-up-down. As long as more than one permutation belongs to a group following a given rule after one or more transformations, more transformations need to be applied. Elaboration: if we have 4 permutations of type up-down-up and we apply transformation a to them and get two of type down-down-up and two of type up-up-down, we need to apply transformation b to the down-down-up group and transformation c to the down-down-up group. Finally we have one permutation from b which changed to down-up-up, one from b which turned to up-up-down, one from c which turned to down-up-down and one from c which turned to down-down-up. Once every permutation belongs to only one group, we store the string of rules that transformation followed until becoming its own group. Moreover, we find what transformation leads to this permutation being sorted, or in up-up-up...-up. In this example the one that ended up as down-up-down would be written as (up-down-up)-(down-down-up)-(down-up-down). 

Once we know how every permutation behaves given a series of transformations, we are ready to sort any list of size n. Keep in mind that the preparation process needs to be done only once. The data structure which holds it together, (im thinking a map with keys being strings of u's for ups and d's for downs and values for the permutations which follow those rules) needs to be created only once and can then be used infinitely many times to sort any list of size n. 

In order to sort a list with the data structure we first look through the list in order to determine which rule it originally follows. Then we apply the transformation we previously chose for this rule and see what rule it changes to. We repeat this process until we reach a rule with only one permutation. At this point we get the sorting transformation and apply it to our list to get a sorted list. 

I realize that the preparation phase for this algorithm is o(n!) but since it needs to be done only once, and after that point it works at worst-case o(nlogn) (or maybe even better, honestly not sure) it may be worth it. Given that n! grows ridiculously fast, I realize the memory the backing data structure requires is a considerable problem. However, maybe it can just be used for small lists. ",17,6,False,self,,,,,

So I think I have a VERY base level understanding of an  adapter as a design pattern, in that it serves as a go between for a client and data set. (If I'm way off let me know).

Context is designing an android application, with an activity communicating with a data set through an adapter

My question is to ensure good OOP design should methods of the calling client asking to manipulate the data in certain ways (ie. delete these objects) be implemented in the Adapter class or within the call client. 

If within the Adapter class should this be done through interfaces? Any good resources out there for understanding good design with adapters?",1,6,False,self,,,,,

Now we're all CS geeks here, so we should immediately know the cause of this bug.


Here's the math:
The user was booking the flight for 15 Mar 2017. 413786 h is about 47.2 years, or 17241 days and 2 hours. If you subtract 17241 days and 2 hours from 16 Mar 2017 02:25 (the date/time when the layover ends, you get 1 Jan 1970 00:00. 1 Jan 1970 is the beginning of the UNIX/POSIX epoch time, which is used in computing to represent time and is defined as the number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.


So why is the page showing this time for the layover? Notice that the arrival time in Bangkok is blank, so it is most likely a null value. The layover time is calculated by subtracting the layover arrival time from the layover departure time. Since the layover arrival time is null, it gets treated as a 0 (which would be treated as 1 Jan 1970 in UNIX time). So we have:

1489631100 (layover departure time) - 0 (layover arrival time) = 1489631100 (calculated layover time) = 413786h 25m

EDIT: Realized I fudged the math a little bit at the end. Should be 25 min, not 25 sec, which would make more sense as the departure time is 2:25. Also realized that this would not exactly be the root cause; the root cause would be whatever caused the arrival time to be null in the first place. Probably some data corruption as the data was sent back from the server.
