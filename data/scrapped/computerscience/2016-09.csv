I did a little bit of coding on Khan Academy (albeit, it was just some very basic HTML and CSS) and seeing the finished products, even though most were bare websites with a couple of links, gave me an immense amount of pride, a sense of pride that I didn't think I could feel about a couple of garbled lines of code. 

I really want to pursue Computer Science, but math and science are not my strongest subjects. Don't get me wrong, I'm not horrible in them (I've been getting A's or B's so far), but I'm not sure if I'm on par with other students who're also pursing Computer Science. I'm currently in regular Pre-Calculus, and, if all goes well, I will be doing AP Calculus AB my Senior year. I'm also in Honors Biology, and will probably just do regular Physics my Senior year. I also currently don't have any space in my schedule to take a class like AP Computer Science (at my school you need to take two semesters of Computer Programming as prerequisites, and I don't have that). In addition to all of that, even though I have coded a little bit, I'm still incredibly inexperienced.

When I discovered Computer Science a couple of years ago, I felt that I'd finally found a subject that was practical, but also gave me room to be creative. It seemed so perfect, but I see what other high schoolers who are also interested in Computer Science are doing, and I feel incredibly inadequate. It just bums me out because I finally found my niche and I feel like I'm too ""stupid"" to actually be successful in it.

Firstly the very first day i started my supervisor gave me some hard task to code, i struggled but managed to do it. I was then given some other to do throughout all these weeks and i have managed to overcome them. This week has literally been the worst. I was assigned a project to work on but the same time the manager came to me and wanted me to do 5 reports for him. So i had to pause my work. 

These reports are built in a software completely new to me  . Have never heard of it. Not only that i have to write massive complicated sql scripts using Sql server which i have never done. Only done a bit of msql at uni. One of the experienced guys has been showing me how to do it and i have been asking him quite alot. 

The manager then called me in his office and said to me if i am struggling he will get another person to do the reports .  Very rude to me. Telling me my supervisor abit disappointed i havent been able to do alot of software hence pushing me to this kind of stuff. And if i dont improve they will end up demoting me to IT support or testing. 

This offended me very much and was overwhelmed thinking im actually not good enough even if ive never done it before. They have never trained me. Theyve just been giving pro
blems to solve without teaching me nothing. However im trying to learn on my own so hard to be able to cope but these guys have zero patience.

I have a REST architecture question.

Say I have a resource, students.  When I make a GET call to my server, I get a list of students with their metadata.

Now I want an additional feature-I want to return a list of students with only some of their metadata, like their ID.  Perhaps you only want to make the previous resource available to the student's parents, and this resource available to whoever wants to call this endpoint.

Would it be more RESTful to:
A) Create a new endpoint for this resource?  For example, if the previous endpoint was something like /students, perhaps something like /students/ids.

B) Use the old endpoint and pass in a parameter that would indicate whether or not to include all the metadata or just the IDs.

What is your argument for each, and why?

It's a smaller school, it doesn't quite have a big name when it comes to Computer Science. But it's a school. I can drive to class while living with my parents at this point.

The next interesting option that I realized I could afford to do is to go to the University of Illinois for my bachelors.

AT the same time, I've literally never heard of this university till yesterday. 

So reddit, can anyone give me any advice? Is UIUC really not that great of a choice? Does it really matter where I get my bachelors? Does it just make more sense to goto UNF?

They have asked me to look into cloud computing to reduce these computation times. Specifically they mentioned Amazon's EC2, Google cloud platform, and Azure and also asked me to consider an in house solution.

I'm completely flustered. All my prior experience has been in web development (I've never deployed or set up any applications, just worked on existing ones). So my knowledge is strictly in programming/app development. When I researched into building my own cloud infrastructure it seemed way out of my league! When I looked at the services EC2/GCP/Azure it seemed a little bit friendlier. What I'm having trouble getting my head around are these questions, any resources or docs are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance =). 

- How do I get machines in the cloud to start doing work (for example, I've seen the console interface for EC2, where i can log in with an account and 'start' an instance, but how do i work with that instance and get it to execute scripts/ run programs etc.. Furthermore, how can I do that programatically (instead of using a console).)

- How will the computation engine run on multiple machines. Is this just a matter of dividing input data and running the same program on multiple machines at the same time ? Is it dependent on the nature of the code ?

First post in here I think so sorry if I'm not following suit, the FAQ is  most certainly the furthest thing from a useful FAQ, empty on my screen pretty much anyway.

My college is small (~5000 undergrad) in the northeast and is private, etc. It's the kinda school I'll tell someone and they'll respond, ""Oh I've heard of that, it's in &lt;some place nowhere near me&gt;!"" which is fine, I don't really care at this point as a senior.

Even worse so, the CS program is extremely lacking. The professors are qualified and got their degrees (all PhD) from good universities but I think they're just a little outdated and the kids that come here don't have the best mind sets all the time. Someone I was talking to said he had a job over the summer and others were laughing at our program compared to theirs.

I never learned advanced data structures or advanced algorithms that people are talking about frequently and with two semesters left, I probably never will, judging by the courses I'm taking now.

My question is this: has anyone been in the same boat? How was the job hunting experience? I have had internships over the years and have some personal experience, so that will help.

I'm trying to solve a came across this problem that has me pretty stumped. It basically goes like this:

You have two people who want to split up *n* number of items. Now each one of them has a **distinct** value for each item. They won't tell you what that value is, but they will tell you the order in which they want them.

The ultimate goal of the problem to be able to determine **definitively** if each person can get at *more then half* of the total perceived value (which we don't technically know).

For example:

Person 1 Wants: Item 1, Item 2, Item 3, Item 4

Person 2 Wants: Item 4, Item 3, Item 2, Item 1

As you can see from the above example Person one can get the first two items and Person 2 can get the second 2 items. In this example we know for sure that they would get more then half because the sum of the first two items has to be greater then the second 2 items.

Using this kind of information you need to create an algorithm that will be able to give you a hard yes if it is possible to split the items between the two people or a soft no if you're not sure if you can.

Here is what I've figured out so far:

1. If you have an odd number of items then you can't give a hard yes because one person would get one item less then the other person.

2. You need to be able to get the first item or else you can't guarantee that you will get the first item.

Example: 70 &gt; 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 4 (Doesn't matter if I get the other 3 because the majority of the perceived value is the first item)

3. The above rule is scalable and you can technically say that if you get the first x number of items then you don't need the next x number of items because we know that the sum of the first set will be larger then the second set.

That's about as far much as I could figure out so far.",6,4

I am a computer science student who took a break after being in general studies to help my family deal with the declining health of my grandmother. During that time I worked in a computer repair shop and learned a lot about os installs, data backups some about Linux and hardware repairs.

 Now I'm trying to dive into the field after returning to school and I want to further my education outside of the classroom. I've read about a lot of things that I could delve into on my own but the more I look around the less I know where to start.

Do I:

 1. Get all of the compTIA certs I can (a+, network+, server+, security+) to help build a general knowledge base

2. Try working with servers and VMs Linux and Windows (This really interests me but I have no clue where to start and worry that I won't have anything tangible I can put in a portfolio)

3. I've already taking a basic c++ course so I could get a better grasp by doing projects and be able to show those off

I know it boils down to where I'd like to end up and for now I like the idea of doing Linux or Windows server administration while being able to develop and script at needed but I don't know if that is something I can learn at home or that I would have anything to show for it.

 All in all it would be amazing if I could get some ideas from people who may have already been in similar positions or anyone who has an opinion on where I could start or find good resources

I just started my sophomore year of college, but with summer classes and AP credit, I am halfway done with my major. 

Because I am relatively ahead, I basically planned to get my undergraduate career done in 3 years as opposed to 4. However, I decided to take a Comp Sci class this year to fulfill a gen-ed requirement and I realized how much I miss studying computer science. So I am thinking about just graduating when I was originally supposed to (2019) in order to complete a CS BA major along with my Biology major. 

I was in a special program in high school where I had to take technology-heavy courses for all 4 years. I decided to take the programming track so I learned how to code in Visual Basic, C#, SAS, and Java. Plus, I did an internship in IT and learned a bit of Bash and Python. I really excelled in my programming courses, I would always score the highest on all my tests (meaning I really understood the logic/theory behind everything) and I had no problem with any of the projects. In fact, my teacher in high school used to make us write code by hand for her tests and I never had any issues with that. So I think I have a good baseline understanding of programming. 

Anyway, in high school I also pursued my interests in health/medicine and biology inside and outside of the classroom. When I went to college I was sure that I would rather pursue medicine as opposed to computer science (I liked my CS classes, but I did not like my CS internship at all). 

I still want to go to medical school. Since college has started I have done ample hours of hospital volunteering, research, a bit of shadowing, etc. so I know that my passion lies in medicine. However, being in my comp class, I really miss computer science as well. I would love to study the intersection of computer science and biology. 

I would have liked to do a computational biology major, but my school has nothing of that sort. I was thinking instead doing a B.A. in Computer Science (there are a few classes in this course of study that deal with computational biology). I do not want to do a B.S. because I do not want to take any math classes in college (I fulfilled my calculus and statistics requirements in high school).

Ultimately, I would like to use this knowledge and try to get a position in a computational biology lab (I know of two that I would like to get into). Also, I would hope that a BA in Computer Science would help me learn enough programming to program something really useful and creative related to Biology (even on a very small scale). Additionally, as a female, I think I would offer that diversity factor medical schools are looking for (since there's not a whole lot of females who major in CS). 

My ultimate question is: am I being to naive in thinking that I could complete a CS major at the university level? Is my background sufficient or do you think I will struggle through the coursework? Even though I took all these classes and really understood these programming languages when I took them, I haven't coded since, so I do not know how much I would remember.",7,0

The catch is that you can't access the actual values of the array. Instead you have a function `compare(l1, l2)` which takes two of the index values at a time and tells you if they are the same or not.

The obvious solution would take `n^2` but is there a clever way that you can determine this in `n log(n)` time?

I know that it's going to be a divide and conquer method because that the section I got the problem from and because I feel like the solution revolves around the idea of looking at one part of the array at a time.",3,5

I'm new to programming and I would like to create a simple regression analysis _without_ NumPy. I bet it's less easier, but I want to know how to do it.

The program will ask which file you want it to read, where the file has a lot of numbers in two columns that are separated with \t (tab). Later, the program will create this simple linear regression analysis.

I've got:
Two variables: x and y, with n observations x_i.

I need to calculate:
The sum of all x's, the sum of all y's, the product of x and y, x^2 and y^2, and:

y_i = alpha + betax_i + _i where the  equals a disturbance.

beta = (n*S_xy - S_x * S_y) / (n*S_x^2 - Sx*Sx)
alpha = (S_y)/n - (beta*S_x)/n

Can anyone give me a hint to how I can start?

Recall that a grammar is defined as G = (V, T, S, P) where V is the set of variables, T is the set of terminal (alphabet) symbols, S is the start symbol (one of the variables), and P is the set of production rules. Suppose that a password for a website is comprised of only letters from {a, b, c} and digits from {1, 2, 3} and must contain at least one such letter and one such digit (but in no particular order). Devise a grammar that generates the language of passwords accepted by this website.

Recall that a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is defined as (Q, , , q 0 , F) where Q is the set of states,  is the input alphabet,  is the transition function, q 0 is the start state, and F is the set of final (accepting) states. Design a DFA that accepts the language in question 1. (Hint: perhaps use a case-based state design similar to the example discussed in class for a DFA that accepts strings with an even number of 0s and odd number of 1s.)",1,0

You must find the median of both sets, but you are unable to see all values at the same time. You can only view the value based on its position. Also we define median as the nth item if both sets were merged and sorted. (So it's not the mathematical median where you need to average to numbers)

The way you solve this is by finding the median of the individual sets. Then seeing which of the two found medians is larger. Remove all elements greater then that median and all elements smaller then the other median. You continue to repeat this process until both sets only have 2 values in them. Finally you can just look at the 4 total value individuals. Sort them and median will be the second highest (because it's defined as so).

Problem is I'm trying to find a way to prove this and I can't find a way. I feel like the way to achieve a proof is by showing that you never throw away the actual median when removing the items great than and lower than the found medians of the individual sets.

I'm figuring out my list of grad schools to apply to (running very late), but right now it's a bit top heavy. So far I've got UIUC, U. Washington, Georgia Tech and University of Utah... I'd like to add a number of options to the list that are safer choices. (I'd also like to have some less stressful options, even if I could get in anywhere.. I want to enjoy grad school.)

I think I've got a pretty strong resume (See below), so I'm looking for more mid-tier schools. The big thing is, I'm interested in learning a lot more about functional programming, theory of programming languages, static analysis and compilers, and I'm not sure how to find schools where those are a thing.

I care more about quality of courses (and local quality of life, though that's pretty subjective) than about super-prestigious research... still figuring out exactly how well-suited I'll be to research. I figure I have at least one solid Master's thesis in me, but past that I might just like to take more advanced coursework and return to industry.

To give you you an idea of where I'm at, for judging what qualifies as a ""Safe"" choice:

 - Just above a 3.0 GPA, but 3.7 if you only look at the last three years (my second run at college), and above a 4.0 if you only look at my CS grades during that time.
 - GRE scores - 90th percentile in math, 99th in verbal/analytic
 - Good/difficult course selection for electives
 - Math double major
 - Two very solid letters of recommendation, several pretty-good options for a third
 - Won site and placed second regional in Tier 2 ACM programming contest
 - Succesful internship (for whatever that's worth), was in charge of a lot of non-trivial features (including the entire security system, from design up)
 - Attached to several research projects (Missed results, did write a spam filter for SoundCloud that the professor had been wanting for a while)
 - Wrote honors thesis (not exactly research, survey paper on static analysis for memory management)
 - Spent my last year of college also caring for both of my parents as they died of cancer, so there's that",5,8

I'm working full time and would like to obtain a master's degree in computer science. I currently hold a bachelor's degree from a well known state university.

My employer will pay for a large portion of my masters on the condition that I complete it entirely online (I must work full time). Here are some online computer science programs I've found:

1) UIUC - Professional MCS. My second choice, not only because it is one of the highest ranked CS schools in the country, but because it only takes 2.5-4 yrs to complete.


2) GA Tech - OMSCS. From what I've read online, this absurdly cheap ($7000!) CS program is top notch, with high quality videos and resources included as part of the program. Plus the acceptance rate is fairly high.


3) Columbia CVN - MS Comp Sci... The Columbia video network provides the same exact degree as the on-site program. The Ivy League name brand is definitely a nice touch. It is quite pricey though.


4) Johns Hopkins - MS Comp Sci. Not in the top 25, but still an extremely good program. They have a really cool robotics lab too, so that's a plus.


5) Stanford - MS Comp Sci. My top choice for sure. Tied for #1 Comp Sci school in the country, but it's the only one with an online master's degree. According to their website, you had to be an employee at one of their ""member"" companies if you wanted to do an online masters through their HCP program. However, I just emailed someone from the department, and she said that this is **not** the case anymore.


**Are there any other top CS schools, other than these five, that offer online computer science (or robotics/AI) degrees?**

EDIT: Schools listed in comments:

6) Carnegie Mellon - Another #1 school. Only offers online degrees in Software Engineering, not computer science. Still a great choice for those who want to manage a team of software engineers one day.

This kind of pissed me off because I don't want to just pass or get by, I want to MASTER the content.  2. My teacher teaches using examples and I think this teaching style is making it difficult for me to learn the basics. Often times I understand what he's saying in context to the problem he is solving, but I lack the ability to apply it to something else.  (I'm not blaming the teacher for this). I'm not trying to blame my teacher for me having a tough time grasping the material so please don't think I'm not taking responsibility for my learning. 

Long story short (sorry): 

1. I need help grasping the concepts of C++ so I can feel more confident working within Microsoft Visual Studios.

2. I need some places that I can get some easy problems so that I can code a little each day. I understand that the best way for me to learn C++ is too work on it everyday.  I am willing to put in the time; I just need some extra resources.

Basically you're given an integer from 0 to 1,000,000 and then told to take the average of any adjacent two numbers, round up and then replace those two integers with that single integer.

For example:

373938 could produce 53938, 35938, 37638, 37368, 37396

(Notice that you will always lose a digit)

The goal is to find which of the possible numbers is the highest. The obvious solution is to just produce every single possible number and then check to see which is the highest but that gives you a time our error once the numbers are too big. Does anyone have any idea how it can be done faster? I've been racking my brain trying to find a way but so far nothing comes to mind.",3,2

One of the classes I am taking is called ""Digital Systems"" and it is basically a course teaching us the fundamentals of digital computing. I have a pretty clear understanding of the lecture material thus far however we have been given an assignment and I am having trouble solving a few of the questions assigned:

Q1. Prove that a carry bit in addition is at most equal 1 in any number system. (Hint: a base B in any system is equal M+1, where M is the biggest digit in given system, sum= 10 produces a carry at any position).

Q2. Show, that there is no overflow possible when you subtract the positive numbers.

Q3. Show, in general terms, that flipping 0-s to 1-s and 1-s to 0-s is a good method to calculate a 1s complement of a number.

These questions need to be proved mathematically. If anyone knows how to answer these questions or has any answers of any type I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much.
