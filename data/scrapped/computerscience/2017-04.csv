The question is in the title, I just want to add a little background.


I already have a masters degree in statistics and have worked in finance for 11 years. I'm more or less good financially (not for retirement, but could easily go without work for 10 years and live comfortably), but wouldn't want to quit my job just yet. I'm trading commodity futures and options and although I can't see myself spending the rest of my life guessing energy prices I'm content at my job.

However, being content isn't quite enough, and after doing a bit of research I've figured out I can do a MSc in computer science in about 3 years (possibly 4). I'm a fluent programmer and have previously implemented Boltzmann machines, feed forward neural networks and that is also what I would like to work with in the future and would do a Phd if I get the opportunity.

The thing is though: 
Let's say I don't do a Phd. How will I be welcomed in the industry as a 42 year old with a fresh degree?  ",7,1,False,self,,,,,

I'm 22f, and I graduated with a BA in Advertising + a minor in Russian last May. 

I'm quite unhappy in marketing, and I've had an interest in coding since I was young, so I want to make the jump to CS. I think formal schooling might be the way to go, but I don't have a clear pathway in mind and could use some advice. 

I've heard of second Bachelor's as a recommendation, as well as a Masters. Don't you need an undergrad degree to pursue an MS? My only CS experience is the Harvard CS50 course, of which I'm about 1/3 of the way through right now. I also had some life-threatening, documented medical issues my senior year, so my last semester brought my cumulative GPA from a 3.2 to a 2.9 upon graduation. |: 

So I don't really think I even qualify for any kind of graduate program, but one of my friends recommends that I ask anyway. I am lucky in that I don't have any educational debt. Cost right now I'd prefer to keep reasonable, but I don't have any specific budget/can make things work if needed. 

Otherwise, I was looking into some online programs that award a second bachelors and usually take 1-2 years, depending on the course load taken and the work hours of the student. 

There's also coding boot camps (still expensive, not as foundational/theoretical?), and self-teaching (harder to get a job, less organized, gaps in skillsets?). 

I'd love to hear any anecdotes and get any advice I can.

Out of HS, I went and did a 5 year tour with the Marine Corps as an avionics guy. Post marine corps I've been hired as an entry level (associate) electrical engineer doing avionics work for Lockheed Martin. When I was hired in I was basically told ""you know enough to be useful on the engineering staff, but if you ever want to see promotion and increase longevity... you need to finish your degree."" Of course the worded it nicer, but that's the meat and potatoes of it. 

Love my job, I want to keep it. I have about 30-40 semester hours towards a ""BS in Information and Computer Science"" with a concentration in software engineering through Park University... but inside this company (Lockheed Martin), they tend to be elitists when it comes to where you go to school and who accredits the school or program; ABET being the preferred agency. I'll outline my issues and concerns below.

- should I transfer to a nicer school with an ABET accredited CS or engineering program and forgo the majority of the progress I've made at Park University? This would obviously make me more competitive, but would take significantly longer because it would be part time and most of my credits probably wont transfer in. A major concern is that if I don't show these guys a degree within the next couple years, that I'm fat waiting to be trimmed from the engineering staff.

- I could just finish my BS in information &amp; computer science from park and then just find an ABET masters program, right? That way I get the piece of paper for promotion quicker and follow it up with an ABET accredited MS a couple years later to prove I belong.

As of now i'm leaning towards Colby. I know most of you may be thinking it's a stupid choice but hear me out! I'm OOS for Ann Arbor and after four years it will end up costing me 168k plus.

Colby has a dual degree option with a 3-2 system. I spend three years at Colby and get a BA degree (Was thinking Math) and then through a guaranteed admission (if I maintain a 3.30+ GPA) I can spend the next two years at Columbia, where I can get a BS in Computer science. This would be five years costing about 119k.

Do you think it's a wise decision? Committing to Colby? I heard internships and job experience is very important for CS Job. Maine would be pretty barren of these but I hope my two years at NY would offset that lack of experience.

What I did before starting and some tips:
  1) I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. 
   2) Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.
   3) I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.
   4) Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.
  5) I study an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot

A little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.

   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.

Note: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.

Note 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose. 

EDIT 16/04/2017: Everyone who joins to the slack team are encourage to look first the two posts, ""Team Community Rules"" and ""General things about this team and the Challenge"" in the channel #general_rules, then you can proceed to start in the #how_to_start channel",56,64,False,self,,,,,

I am debating on whether I should go back to college and get a CS or not to worry about it.  I'm 29 years old, currently work in the tech industry have been for about 10 years now.  I work as a QA Engineer mainly doing manual/exploratory testing for our products.  

I've always wanted to get a CS degree, but life has a funny way of making it ""more challenging"" to get.  My work as offered to start teaching me to write simple Python automation to start tackling our backlog and current features.  Only problem is, we are so busy and short staffed, that there has a been little to no movement on starting this.  

I have been teaching myself Python, but I feel the progress is slower than it would be by just going back and getting a CS.  I already have an associates degree so all general classes are done.

My question comes down to, would it be worth my time getting a CS degree at this point in my career?  I'll have to go part-time since I do have a family/full-time job and it will take roughly 4-5 years to complete, putting me at 34-35 when I would graduate.

Currently 9 months in, still have 3 years and few months left before I get out. Have completely no idea about enrolling and getting started with college. Did some research and have a general idea but still pretty confused about the process. I, for sure, know that I want to get a bachelor's in computer science.

With that being said, being in the military, doing school is kinda hard especially because I live on the military base and have no car. But there are a few colleges that are on base, however, the classes available are limited. So, only way for me to do college is online.

The thing that confuses me is that does Bachelor in CS require general education? Because when I get out of the military, I'm thinking about using the GI Bill to pay for my college, thus I do not want to enroll in a high cost online university. I just want to start off slowly with college classes(preferably in a online community college) that are relevant and slowly progressing, then when I get out I can finish the rest.

Is it possible to get a associate degree(if so, which one), then transfer to university and go for Bachelor in CS? Or does CS not require general education and I am better off just enrolling in a CS online university?

I guess the thing that I'm trying to say is that...

* Because of situation, I can only do online college/general education college classes in my area

* I don't have much time thus can only take 1-3 classes a week (depending on difficulty)

* I don't have the money or want to enroll in high cost university(as stated above) thus prefer community college

* I do want to start progressing in getting the bachelor's in CS (Doing classes that is actually reducing the time that I have to be in college when I get out of the military for CS degree)

How do I start/What can I do?

Edit: If it matters, I am stationed in San Diego, but I am from Arizona. So I can do college from both state.

I am a sophomore Computer Science student, but I only just began the major this semester, so I am very behind other students in my courses (I am taking the Intro 101 class in the spring of my sophomore year). I will still be able to graduate on time comfortably, but a recruiter told me that it would be hard to compete for internships and jobs during recruiting (which happens during junior year fall) because I have taken less classes than students I will compete with. In particular, I won't have taken Data Structures, which makes it really hard to do well in technical interviews. So she asked if I would be comfortable taking an extra semester in school, because this would push back my junior year by one year and I will have taken more classes by the time I do recruiting in the fall. Basically I'd graduate a semester late so I could retain junior status for a longer time and get more classes and experience comparable to the other people I'd be competing with during recruiting.

I dont like the idea of taking an extra semester of school that will be essentially useless. I am fortunate enough to have my parents be paying for my education, and I don't think that it makes any sense to waste their money on an extra semester that I don't need. So I thought that instead of staying an extra semester, it would be a good idea to take a semester off of school. I could take data structures next fall, then take the spring semester off, and then I would come back to school in the fall for my second ""junior"" year having taken data structures, which would get me more up to speed with my peers. I would also use the summer before coming back to school to hopefully get a good internship, and if not, to work on personal projects to build my portfolio. Which would, again, benefit me a lot when applying for positions.

I would however, be graduating a semester late, and in the winter instead of in the spring. I would also have more and better internships under my belt. Is the late graduation something that employers care about in tech? And is it worth it to graduate a semester late in exchange for the gain in experience I get?
If you dont think it is worth it, then why?

If you do think its worth it, thats great! Now, the next question (and perhaps more thorny problem) is what I should do with that semester off.

I know it would be more sensible for my career and such to use that semester off of school to work or get an internship for more experience. However, I have always *really* wanted to travel, but my parents were not comfortable with me taking a gap year before school. They also were not comfortable with me studying abroad my freshman year, and now that I am in the Computer Science major, it is very hard to study abroad through the school.
I know that an internship would be more sensible, but I feel like this is a really good opportunity for me to travel for an extended period of time, without having to worry about responsibilities like taking time off from work like I would once Im employed. Travel has always been something I've seen as important, and I'm really terrified that I won't be able to do it until its too late.  It would realistically be quite a while until I could support taking a few months off of work to travel if I try to do this when I have a career. Life and responsibilities always get in the way. I don't want to wake up in my 40s one day and regret not doing this - that seems like the worst thing I could do to myself. Maybe it's a silly goal, but it's never going to be so easy in my life to travel as it is right now. I don't really have ""responsibilities"" as such - no career, no family, no boss to worry about. I have been calculating costs, and I think I will be able to afford paying for about 3 months of travel with the money I make from my internship this summer along with working part-time next semester, so I won't be burdening my parents. And the timing of it should actually help my career instead of hindering it, based on what I explained earlier about the benefits in taking a semester off.

I could get into a lot of personal reasons as to why I want to travel and why I think it'll be beneficial, besides being fun, of course, but basically, I have heard a lot about how beneficial gap years are in gaining maturity and perspective and therefore helping kids get more out of college once they get there. I never got to have that experience and I really regret that because I often feel like I am not mature enough to be getting everything I should be out of college. I am enjoying my time here and I am doing fine, but I dont think Ive grown nearly as much as Id hoped I would here. Coming back to career stuff, I think it hurts me because I come across somewhat unconfident and immature. Now Im not saying travel is the solution to everything, but I do feel that I desperately need some real world experience and I think that solo travel is one of the best ways to do it, and fulfills a goal that is really important to me.
I know there are many typical concerns about taking a semester off, such as not coming back to school and all, but I want to emphasize that I really do love school, and I have a clear cut schedule of how I would do this so I can come back to school and make this whole experience beneficial to me. I am not trying to run away from school, I just feel like I need to get some more perspective and grow as a person, so I can come back really ready to get everything out of this place that I can before I graduate. If I was the type of person that didnt like school, I would not do this, because I know that I would never come back. 

While it would obviously be a good idea to intern during the semester off, instead of traveling, I feel like I am making up for that trade off by getting in an extra summer internship, plus structuring my schedule so I take the data structures class before recruiting, helping me to land better internships to get better jobs down the line. Not to mention of course, the benefits that come out of extended solo travel.

I know that this plan would seem foolish and impractical to a lot of people (including my parents!) but Ive been thinking about it for some time and I dont really see any huge negatives. I would be graduating a semester late, but I think that it would be made up for with huge gains in experience, along with maturity and real world experience (also desirable for employers, I think?). And I have been reading from similar postings on Quora and it seems that employers, especially in tech, dont really care a lot about an extra semester in school. I really want to hear perspectives from people specifically in tech though, because I dont really know how this plan would be perceived in the work world.

TL;DR: Is it worth it to take a semester off of school to boost my chances during recruiting? And is it a bad idea to take that semester to travel instead of doing an internship or something to advance my career?",6,6,False,self,,,,,

I'm really enjoying it so far. One thing I noticed very quickly during my first semester is that the professors are probably the most ""hands-off"" of any department.

It's clear they're trying to perpetuate the ""active learning"" philosophy, where the professors usually stand off to the sides and offer a minuscule amount of assistance in order to force us to solve problems on our own. Studies have shown that this creates a deeper level of understanding, and it's closer to how things are going to work outside of college, so I think it's a good thing in the long term. However, I do have an anecdote of where things can go wrong that I wish to share.

We were recently assigned a video game to code in Java (purpose of the assignment was to learn polymorphism). They linked us to a graphics library with absolutely zero guidance and told us to figure it out. We all got it done, but some had more success than others. The instructors decided that we needed an extra class on polymorphism, because a lot of us apparently had ""smelly code.""

The professor noted that a lot of people used ""instanceof"" for collision detection, which is apparently a bad idea. But he never explained *why* it was a bad idea. He simply said polymorphism should allow us to avoid that. The rest of the class was focused on implementing a new game element and it sidestepped that issue completely.

A (in my opinion dangerous) trend I've noticed is that professors are extremely reluctant to offer direct answers to questions in class. Granted, I know they have 20 people to attend to and they can't stop to debug everyone's code, but surely the professor could have gone into more detail, right? If the mistake was common enough that he failed to mention it, why would he just stop at saying ""this is wrong"" and give zero elaboration? I know they like us to figure things out for ourselves (and we did have access to a correct solution), but is it really that difficult to open up the sample and compare it with an incorrect solution and squash the problem outright?

I'm not saying I like a straight-up lecture where we are just given solutions. I really do enjoy the hands-on problem solving aspect of CS. Wouldn't a balance of direct instruction and active learning be better than one extreme or the other?

Anyways, that's my story. I'm not coming here to vent. I'm really just curious what others experiences have been and what their opinion of their education was.",4,8,False,self,,,,,

There are 2 main GI bill scholarships, and I can only use one at a time. The DEA covers just tuition, which is about $6000 for me. The Fry scholarship covers absolutely everything, housing, books, tuition, whatever I need, which amounts to about $22000. They each cover 36 months of class, so 4 years of schooling.

The issue I am facing is whether or not it is worth it to use the DEA scholarship first, and try to make up the difference in community based scholarships so I can save the Fry scholarship, which I will be eligible for until I am 33, to get my masters degree. The downside to using the DEA is there are a ton of smaller community scholarships that I have to apply for separately and have to reapply for every year.

My intended major is computer science, and from what I've been reading about, the two years of experience in the work force is more valuable than a masters degree. If this is true, then I see no reason to not use the Fry scholarship first since it is a single scholarship that will cover all my needs.

I have spent hours trying to figure it out and only have a day left. The more I stare at it the more confused I am getting, and the messier it becomes. If anyone has any help or insight I would be forever grateful.

**The project description is as follows:**

Input a positive odd integer N, then compute the sum of the odd integers less than or equal to N.

=1+3+5++

&gt; The user input will ALWAYS be a two-digit odd number (between 01 and 99). You do NOT need to check the correctness of the input. For example, if the user input is 21, then your program will output 121.

Now, I have figured out how to input the two digit number by taking one character at a time. Multiply the first character by ten and add it to the second character. I cannot seem to begin converting the other direction. Dividing the number out to get the individual digits to print their ascii values one at a time.

For example given the number 1234, I would:
* divide by 1000, print the resulting value as ascii
* divide by 100, print the resulting value
* divide by 10, print the resulting value
* divide by 1, print the resulting value
*subtracting the 1000 * a counter, etc. along the way?*

Below is my incomplete code. Note here I haven't even dealt with inputs yet. I am trying to just work out the conversions. I doubt the code is even any use to anyone here. Anyway I just cant wrap my head around it, and its the final project for this particular class. :/ HELP

The problem is this:

A group works together, all the members of the group are known.  At the end of the project, or on some time interval, we want to assess and create a ""percent contribution"" for each member of the group, such that the sum of percents for all group members = 100%.  IE: Alice, Bob and Charlotte, each contributed 30, 30 and 40% to the end result.

Here are the caveats:

 * there's an unknown number of participants, typically less than 50, in the 2-20 range usually. (small groups)

 * the end credit assignments can be incredibly important: funding, reputation, and potentially even careers could be at stake (high stakes)

 * we can ask whatever ratings or feedback we want of participants to assess each other, in any number of rounds.  simpler is better. 1 round is best, and one question in one round ideal. (???)

 * not all members may know the contributions of all other group members, so some may opt out in part or in whole from feedback (blanks)

 * some members may want to defer in part or in whole their feedback to the knowledge of another in the group (proxies)

 * some members may outright lie either for political or personal ends to gain more credit than they deserve (lies)

 * some people will want to assign negative contribution to others (negatives)

 * the data collection will be signed, public, and the algorithms for credit assignment in the group will be transparent, so anyone else can check the results and how they were obtained (public)
