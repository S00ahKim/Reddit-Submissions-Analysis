&amp;#x200B;

I've came up of an idea to Generalize the concept that it might be possible to  reduce subset sum into my Sudoku puzzle generation following the shift(L) language.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, lets look at the subset sum problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Given a tuple of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero?  
&gt;  
&gt;\[-3, -2, 5\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The answer is Yes!,  -3+-2+5=0  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, I'll generalize the same concept into my shift(L) puzzles  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Given a set of n2 by n2 puzzles (both shift(L) and regular) which ones follow shift(L)?**

&amp;#x200B;

# Generalization Concept

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose, we take a *proof* that subset sum is *NP-complete* and **reduce it into our Sudoku Subset Problem.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Suppose, we reduce 3-CNF-SAT to Subset Sudoku Problem. The formula in 3-cnf is *c1 and c2 and c3 and c4*,   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;c1 = x1 or not x2 or not x3  
&gt;  
&gt;c2 = not x1 or not x2 or not x3  
&gt;  
&gt;c3= not x1 or not x2 or not x3

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose we have a satisfying assignment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I probably have them in the wrong place, but it'll do for the generalization. And, if it is we'll just swap terms in our decision problem to make it true.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;x1 = shift(L)  
&gt;  
&gt;x2 = shift(L)  
&gt;  
&gt;x3 = regular

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

x1  x2  (x3  x1)  x2  (x3  x1)  x2  x3

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](pi13yfqkshv21 ""Generalized Concept of Subset Sudoku Circuit-SAT"")

&amp;#x200B;

  
Now, this generalization implies that it should be possible to reduce circuit-sat and all other np-complete problems into my Subset Sudoku Problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ddphhfq4thv21 ""Here's the truth table"")

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the generalization is correct and that figuring out if shift(L) grids and puzzles are NP-complete for n2 by n2 size. If you can give me your opinions on the matter for such an interesting concept. I would love to discuss something so mentally stimulating.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I've did some reading into co-np, Np-hard, Np-complete, p vs np and did more studying seriously into the concepts than the last time.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background, I am a web app account manager for a .NET software development firm. We also build native apps, but I'm not on that side of the business. A bulk of my responsibility is managing small-mid-enterprise organization websites in a variety of industry verticals. 

My undergraduate and graduate degrees are in communications, so the bulk of my development knowledge is learned on the job. Often, I rely on our developers and software engineers to answer my questions about technology solutions, which I don't like.  I'd like to be more self-sufficient, and allow them to continue their work. Rather than diving into Google right away, I thought I'd take a stab at tapping into some collective knowledge here. More specifically, I'd like to learn about web app technology trends (i.e., hosting, integrations, languages, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Two questions:

1. What sources do you recommend for someone in my position?
2. Are there any emerging trends to pay more attention to than others?

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to be able to consult clients on the latest technologies, and follow in the footsteps of specialists' and how they obtain knowledge on web technologies.

Our quality assurance process involves a single person manually testing front-end testing on physical devices (i.e., tablets, smartphones, computers) and using Browserstack. They also conduct backend testing (content editing in content management system), but they mainly focus on the content editing experience instead of stress testing its use cases. They're more versed in UI testing. Additionally, a software engineer reviews the commits, but does not test the functionality. It feels like bugs, sometimes apparent bugs, are slipping through to production too and being identified by the client. One recent example of an occurrence, without going into too much detail, is we completed 13 tasks. Seven of the tasks had usability or creative issues. I'm not able to test sites extensively since I have other responsibilities. 

My feelings are that our QA methodology is somewhat primitive and the testers are not introducing new technologies or modern process. We recently started using Test Studio on select web apps, but not my projects.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is one person manually testing a single site's development and maintenance the modern way of testing? 
2. If not, what are your thoughts on a modern quality assurance practices for web development?
3. Is the use of third-party software testing companies a trend? I feel like I'm seeing more and more.

In 6 months I'll be sitting for college placements and I havent worked on any real projects. All my professors have the same reply that publish a research paper.

1. College - English
2. Few online tutorials, few meetups and seminars, conferences
3. Coding bootcamp
4. TA at bootcamp
5. **Current:** Moved to CA to live with SWE brother.

I was not the top in my cohort. I used to have alot of top students complain about how students with my background (non tech) could not possibly keep up with a C course and so on.

I agreed with them, but knew they were students as well - *most of them went to college for CS and did the bootcamp, some did freelancing, others were either in a startup once or did another bootcamp* - and  I was not about to let their words stall me when I knew they would not care if they were in my shoes.

I did whatever I could to graduate but knew my abilities still didn't improve. I had a hard time with ds + algorithms and was incompetent with building projects quickly. 

I moved to CA and my brother told me I wasn't ready for a job so I started studying. He told me not to look for a job until I am 'ready'. 

It has been 4 months and more. He told me not to work on projects but focus on interview questions. Most of the time I'm just confused studying the material and my mind freezes up. I joined an interview bootcamp. I have been doing ds and algorithms, leetcode, read the books he wanted me to read but to be honest, I have attempted to quit several times because I'm always struggling with a problem before I solve it. 

I was even willing to move out of CA because I didnt want to be under my brothers roof while he was paying the bills and I'm still struggling to stop my 1.5 year unemployment. He's done alot to get me to where I am today, but I am frustrated that things are not moving and I am at a standstill 

My brother wants me to apply to big companies but I feel like it is taking me too long to solve problems, and I know there are other students who can solve them quickly. I have just been rejected by Pinterest, and I have an interview coming up with Google. I won't lie, I'm just not sure if I can do this. I feel like it is better for me to start small.

The pressure in this field is something I just can't handle and it is really hard for me to keep up knowing that others have it easier. I'm grateful my brother gave me the chance to live with him, but I feel like I should have been able to at least get started somewhere already.",1,0

**g(L)p**, because **shift(L)  p**, and **S(L)  NP**.

&amp;#x200B;

Since, **S(L)** puzzles share **shift(L)** grids.

As their solutions then it must be true that **S(L)  g(L)**.

Since, **S(L)  NP** and **g(L)p, S(L)** then it must be true...

&amp;#x200B;

To get an idea what a participant would do, here are 2 examples:

1. You will get the game (free demo) and do some specific tasks and I will observe (Screen sharing) and ask why and how you do it and where you have problems (I evaluate the game, not you!)

2. We have a Q.A. or a short interview related to the usability.

&amp;#x200B;

A very brief explanation about Usability: 

With evaluating a product considering the usability, it can improve its effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, error tolerance and learnability.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I post this here:

I made a survey with Factorio users to work out the user group and common patterns. Based on these results I'm spreading out to find people fitting in the user group.

Factorio has some parallels to programming and logical thinking, planning and problem solving. Many Factorio players have an IT / programming background. So I was thinking that some people here who like games may also be interested it, and so would be candidates for my usability test.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a small survey to find possible candidates for usability tests. The survey takes less than 5min

I am a 31 year old stuck in a mid level management position for last
the last 6 years in construction estimation. I don't feel like this is
my calling and I want to go back to school. Computer science intrigues
me and I feel like it would benefit my career to go into a path in
technology considering today's world. I have always been intrigued by
how people can make apps, webpages, and software. I have just recently
built my first PC with the help of my cousin, and it has started my
curiosity.

I have the following questions looking for advice:

- First off, is it worth it?

- Can a 31 year old be taught these things?

- Any recommendations or expectations?

- I was planning online courses, is this a good or bad idea?

- What will be the hardest thing I have to learn? I always have been
good at math when I was in school, but that seems ages ago.

- Does career outlook seem good to you newly hired degree holders?


I appreciate the help you can give. I have 4 children to support, and
want to make sure I'm making the best decision for myself and my
family.

Thank you.",12,0

Using the code we did in class today, create a program which displays an analog clock with hours, minutes and seconds. As you know, the sleep function is imprecise, so you should, periodically, update the time from http://nist.time.gov/actualtime.cgi (Note: DO NOT REQUEST THE TIME MORE OFTEN THAN ONCE PER MINUTE!!!!). For this, you will ned to fashion an HTTP request similar to the sample in which we requested Google's homepage.

Edit:

It seems NIST now requires HTTPS connections. You can use the sample code below as a guideline for making this work:

public static void main(String[] args) {
try{
SSLSocketFactory factory =(SSLSocketFactory)SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket socket =(SSLSocket)factory.createSocket(""nist.time.gov"", 443);
socket.startHandshake();

After dedicating my entire life to becoming a doctor, I have finally taken the leap to follow my lifelong passion in technology. Specifically, I am planning on becoming a computer scientist/programmer. My question today isn't whether or not I'm doing the right thing, as I know that I'm infinitely more passionate about technology and computers than about medicine. Rather, I would like some advice and insight about how to jumpstart my new career, given my past experience and education.

At my age, I would think that the most efficient/affordable way to build my knowledge is through taking computer science courses at a local community college. Fortunately I live within ten minutes of such a college that offers a 2-year associate's degree in CS. I was wondering - would I be able to transfer any credits from my previous education toward a CS degree? I hold a bachelor's in biological sciences from Northwestern University, and have completed nearly three years of medical school (like I said, unorthodox..). If I'm able to transfer these credits, is it possible to obtain that associate's degree in much less time? Or alternatively, would it make more sense to try to apply those credits toward a second bachelor's degree in CS? I know for certain that community college is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than going back to a large university...

I have very little programming experience but a very strong work ethic, and I'm open to all suggestions and advice. Thank you!",6,0

Currently, I'm using Visual Studio Code (basically Visual Studio Lite) with some plugins that make SSH work and all that. It works fine but it's not a fully featured IDE by any means. 

Over the summer, I want to switch to a more fully fledged IDE and use something like Bitvise (or whatever its called) to upload my files to the server. I'm wondering which IDE is used most in industry, as I figure that getting used to that early is a good idea. 

I know the two big ones are probably Eclipse and Visual Studio. Are there any others I should be aware of, or does it depend? And if possible can any connect via SSH to a remote server or is Bitvise my best option?

I also want to center my major more around programming. The computers I have currently are an old MacBook air that I am donating to my younger sibling when I get a new one. I also have a custom build gaming pc that is pretty high end.

**Technology:**

First off, what type of laptop should I buy? \*assuming price is not an issue\*

Mac? I love how MacBooks integrate into the ""apple experience"" and how all the products are very reliable and well built. I'm not sure if I should drop 2k on a new laptop going into college, only to realize that I need windows to efficiently do things in computer science.

Windows? I have been looking into the ThinkPad x1 carbon. That thing is a beast and has an amazing keyboard for a laptop. (i have an Anne pro 2 so when I'm at home keyboard won't really matter though).

Anything else? if you have any anecdotal evidence of a great keyboard that you use for computer science please share. I am open to all help and suggestions.

**Misc:**

What languages should I try and learn over the summer before I go to my fall term? What will be the most useful in college and which ones will the the most practical?

Comp sci majors, what tricks did you use in uni to get through and not want to kill yourself. I have heard that the major gets really difficult towards the end.

Since machine learning, and other forms of artificial intelligence software, are so widely used across both academic and corporate research, replicability or reproducibility is a critical problem. Keeping the data under version control with Git-LFS is a big improvement. But the lack of version control of the data files is not the entire problem.

The determining factors for the results of training a model or other activities include the following:

* Training datathe image database or whatever data source is used in training the model
* The scripts used in training the model
* The libraries used by the training scripts
* The scripts used in processing data
* The libraries or other tools used in processing data
* The operating system and CPU/GPU hardware
* Production system code
* Libraries used by production system code

Obviously the result of training a model depends on a variety of conditions. Since there are so many variables to this, it is hard to be precise, but the general problem is a lack of whats now called Configuration Management.

And lo and behold I got a call the problem is I only know Java (well at least i'm comfortable with it and I did a job for 3 months on Android). That being said I did learn .net when I was in the university and passed with a '-A' but I never really followed or explored it after that .

So I got the call they did say  ""We only work on .net and your CV doesn't have that on it"" To which I replied ""Yes, I did learn it and made a project on it 2 years ago when I studied it but never followed it"" So they said ""Can you catch up on .net within a week before the interview ?"" And I STUPIDLY said ""Y...Yeah"". 

And here I am, any advice ? What do I do ? Should I go to the interview with whatever I can prep within a week? Should I just tell them that it's not for me ? or Just simply not even go without telling them ? (Which seems a bit shitty on my end)

P.S It is a decent company So ......

Any advice will be helpful though . PEACE !",3,2

I'm torn between programming and white hat hacking as career.
I like both enough. 
My research says that white hat hacking has:
-bigger salary 
-maybe less people to support this field? 
-I'm good enough in technical stuff 

But one thing that convinces me to go into programming is that I find a lot of remote programming jobs with salaries at least 50k/year which is incredibly good for me because I live in Greece and we don't get more than 20-25k/year. 
Also by being a programmer you have open opportunity to be an System architect in which I'm also very good.


Can you find white hat hacking remote job or there are only few?

I understood the first step which is to split the set of numbers into subsets of the same size, and to calculate the each processors sum of their subset of numbers (partial sums)

This is the given coding for the first step:

sum[Pn] = 0;   
for (i = 1000*Pn; i &lt; 1000*(Pn+1); i += 1)     
sum[Pn] += A[i]; /*sum the assigned areas*/

An extra MS in CS? Conditional acceptance following performance at the Masters level?

I'm interested in pursuing computational social science research at the PhD level. Considering schools in Information/HCI/Linguistics/CS (data science) and struggling to make sense of some viable ways to make myself more desirable for CS departments specifically. I'm a huge fan of some of the NLP/HCI work in a few CS programs (NYU, UW, Stanford, GeorgiaTech), but I noticed CS programs expect strong math/CS prereqs that I simply never had to take in school (linear algebra, differential equations, data structures and algorithms). 

I have a very specific interest in studying online communities/social networks and statistical NLP, specifically applications in hate speech detection, algorithmic moderation, design of multilingual computing interfaces, and human raters/data quality in ML pipelines. 

What I'm doing now: taking courses this summer/fall at a nearby college in math and CS. Considering a 1-2 year MS in CS if necessary (though I'd like to avoid it).

If additional info helps explain my situation: 

* BS psychology/BA philosophy, Masters in HCI, GRE/GPA won't be a problem
* 2nd author publication in a top tier communications journal doing qualitative work on social media, research experience in computational linguistics from undergrad, one grad level NLP class on transcript
* At least 2 good letters of rec, although both in HCI **without a focus on computation**
* I use python/R (self-taught) and stats frequently for data analysis at work
* A CS faculty member I know personally said I need to prove my math and programming chops via a publication in NAACL/ACL (ideally) or coursework and it has me panicking.",8,3

Just when I think I am starting to understand it I find a new spanner than gets thrown into the works. I feel like I am in conflict with myself between what is right or wrong.
I am attempting to find the big O notation, time it takes and time it takes doubled for two algorithms.

1) 
SET sum TO 0
FOR i=1 to 1,000,000
   FOR j=1 to 10,000
sum = sum + 1

I believe the Big O for this algorithm is O(n) and calculate that the time it would take would be:
1,000,000 * 10,000 = 10,000,000,000 ops
10,000,000 / 1,000,000 = 10,00,000 seconds

I just feel like somehow this isn't correct somewhere..

Algorith 2)
SET sum TO 0
FOR i=1 to 1,000,000
   FOR j=1 to 1,000,000
sum=sum + 1

I've only come to the conclusion that this is o(n^2).

&amp;#x200B;

I am a HS Comp Sci and I have noticed that we have a serious problem in Computer Science education... at least at the high school level. Either students get a teacher that has little to no knowledge of programming, or they get a teacher that is a programmer, but not the skills to teach. Often times even if the teacher has programming and teaching abilities, a better job offer comes along to pay them more. The result is that the students suffer because great teachers aren't paid enough to hang around, especially in CS. Online tutorials are helpful, but that doesn't help the students with little CS experience or knowledge to pull from.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that teachers get tons of days off and we are ""off"" around 3. But if you ask a teacher, they're days-off are often spent grading and lesson planning. The thought that we get off at 3 is ridiculous... And to prevent me from going in to a rant that nobody wants to listen to, I will leave it at that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is that I am frustrated that there isn't a bigger emphasis on CS education in general, more professional development incentives for teachers in CS, or some way to just get better CS teachers. I am not sure there is an easy answer to this, but wanted to know some thoughts and make people outside the CS education aware of this frightening fact when the future growth of CS is so immense.",18,50

To give you a little insight into our document you can read a summary of the paper here.

**Abstract**

We provide a technical exposition of the HelixMesh protocol and the underlying DAG-based transaction ledger. The HelixMesh is based on the double-consensus MeshCash framework and the Snowball protocol of the Avalanche family. The main advantage over existing BFT consensus protocols is a high degree of flexibility: the protocol can be deployed in both permissionless and permissioned environments. Moreover, virtually any BFT consensus is suitable for the off-chain layer of the HelixMesh. As a result, the liveness vs safety tradeoffs are not dictated by the protocol itself but may be adjusted based on the particular use-case requirements. This makes the HelixMesh a robust blueprint for IoT-sourced distributed ledgers

I apologize in advance if this question seems unintelligent but I just started in my new role and could use some guidance.  

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started took on the position of Data Architect for a mid sized financial services firm in the U.S.  My position did not have a predecessor, so I've had to define my role as time passes to see where my skills are needed.  I've basically realized my role entails the following: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Data discovery 

2. Data cleanup 

3. Data access consolidation 

4. Data governance 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the issues my firm has is that the data power users have too much liberty with the raw data and little guidance on data defaults (i.e. how do you define active clients via data logic) and as a result, reporting numbers among different areas of the firm.  They have also have their own SQL server environments with copies of databases and tables from our core data.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've since suggested, and was approved, to centralize these SQL server environments into a single environment, controlled by I.T. and myself.  So the data power users in different areas of the firm will access this single environment where we will create views/tables w/ populated with subsets of data populations (i.e. active clients, international clients, etc.) 

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thought was to restrict the users from each other via schemas, and create a global schema where all users can access global data.  For example: 

&amp;#x200B;

Database1

\-&gt; Global Schema - contains tables w/ data beneficial to all users (either from Schema 1 or 2) and users can R but not C/U/D

\-&gt; Schema 1 - contains tables w/ data beneficial only to users in Schema 1 and these users from this schema can C/R/U/D in this schema and others cannot C/R/U/D

\-&gt; Schema 2 - contains tables w/ data beneficial only to users in Schema 2 and these users from this schema can C/R/U/D in this schema and others cannot C/R/U/D

&amp;#x200B;

My questions to this forum.  Am I taking the right approach in centralizing their data access to a single SQL server and restricting their access to each other's data via Schemas?  

&amp;#x200B;

Any guidance or opinions will be appreciated greatly.  Thank you folks.",0,3

Its 9 days from exam day, and Im super worried.  Ive been doing practice problems from 5 steps to a 5 and did well for the ones I did.  However I did not do well on the questions in collegeboards prep.  All multiple choice questions (and even the FRQs require me to trace code).  I do really bad on nested for loops where the counter variable for either loop are reused in the loop or when theres a lot of variables being manipulated at once.

I need to get good at tracing code fast.  And then I need to get good at writing it for the FRQ, although another problem is that the instructions for the FRQ can be so convalouted that I dont know what its talking about half the time.

Ive been going over problems with my dad (who is a programmer) and doing coding bat.

Does anyone have anything to say about the exam?

Im really worried because if I dont pass this, my college schedule will be ruined because CS1 is required for CS2, which is the gateway class to all other classes in the major at the college Im going to.",4,1

I must admit I feel a bit awkward posting this but as they say, ""when there's a will, you need to find a way"" (...or do they?).

So I'm a Mathematics student passionate with sciences, and I recently came across the website *Brilliant.org* and simply find it...brilliant! (No pun intended)

In all seriousness, I'm currently self-teaching myself as I'm unable to attend lectures right now and will be sitting my exams in a couple of months and I find this website to be a valuable resource.

When looking into putting up together the panoply of the perfect student, one ought to notice that brokenness often represents a major aspect of due diligence! So I'm here to offer you guys help with your French homework in exchange for a one-month subscription to Brilliant (it costs around 8 or 9 dollars and you have the option to offer the subscription as a gift through their website, which means it is safe).

I'm a French native speaker, I study in France and in French, which, I believe, would make me proficient enough to help with grammar, writing, spelling, translation, etc...

That's pretty much all.

Here's a link to Brilliant if you want to have a look at their content: [https://brilliant.org/](https://brilliant.org/)

If you have any question please do not hesitate to drop me a private message or reply to this thread (or topic, board, inquiry... Delete as appropriate)

(If you are a fellow student that needs help and can't afford it, I'd be happy to help too, just ask me whatever it is you are stuck on and I'll do my best).

He did like the idea of converting the joke ""Now One (College) Degree Hotter"" into JavaScript, and he attempted it. I guess it isn't the best or something because he doesn't think it makes sense. Here's the code:

Abstract

The cryptocurrency platforms such as BitCoin and Ethereum rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Following the PoW, the nodes that solve the computationally intensive cryptographic puzzle is given the opportunity to create the next block in return for an incentive. Such puzzle-solving nodes are called mining nodes,"" and its owners' are referred to as miners. Mining nodes are powerful computation platforms with the ability to perform computationally-intensive tasks. Although contemporary PoW computations demand high computation resources, the outcome of the PoW is not practical as the result of the computation is not used for any other applications except securing the blockchain. Using the mining nodes to execute practical algorithms for applications such as artificial intelligence, protein folding, and video processing would increase the effectiveness of the mining nodes while securing the blockchain. However, the distribution of computation tasks and sensitive data among trustless mining nodes leads to security vulnerabilities. Besides, the lack of technologies for verifying the result of the computation performed by the mining nodes makes verifiable computation impractical. In this work, we formulate the verifiable computation problem, discuss the existing work, and propose a novel platform for verifiable computation for the Helix Tangle.

I'm a year out from graduating with 2 bachelors degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics. I am 100% sure I want to pursue Computer Science in graduate school, and have begun the process of looking at schools across the country, comparing their research, requirements, costs , etc. The issue is that regardless of the school, I don't meet the requirements for their programs in terms of courses I've taken. With my curriculum, I've only taken discrete math and Programming in Java. I am missing Algorithms, Programming in C/C++, Computer Organization, Operating Systems, and Data Structures. Some graduates schools allow you to take the prerequisites there, so the masters program would be prolonged, while others flat out state you need to have them done before even applying. That's when I found out about Post-BA programs, such as -&gt; ([https://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more](https://admissions.ufl.edu/apply/more)). Is this what I'd need  to do before applying to graduate school? Would graduate computer science programs accept these courses since their not taken in order to get some formal degree?

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone wondering how I'm so sure I want to do computer science without formally taking those courses above, I've worked at a Precision Robotics lab for about two years and have done work in machine vision, machine learning, and lots of programming in c++ as well as some work with digital logic. I love the stuff but want to really focus on machine learning applications to robotics in the future.

C#. I have been doing a lot of experimentation with parsing xml protocols. I was interested in finding ways to apply an algorithmic approach to dealing xml protocols. I applied an implementation of KMP algo for text processing to deal entirely with byte arrays. 

The key here is i knew the structure of the xml messages before hand.

My general thought process was that i am looking for an array of bytes (xml tag) within the larger array of bytes (xml message). Most generally i knew that this meant that i was interested in a particular arrangement of a particular number of byes (the byte array representation of the xml tag) so when searching for the tag i did not need to look at all the bytes. 

Something else i knew is i did not want to allocate new array space so i used the arraysegment object class to in essence mark up the xml message array where ever i found a value (that being the content between an open and a close tag)

Where nested xml was found i would go ahead and markup as an arraysegment then pass that particular array segment to another method to essentially do the same thing again to the nested content. Delineating once again more array segments on top of the original array but within the area of the arraysegment enclosing the nested content this way i was able to reduce the search space as well. In a way using the first arraysegment to say search within this x area.

I learned C++ language in my junior and senior year.

I also put my hands on Java language in my sophomore year and learned easy-peasy concepts (which includes functions, classes and arrays only). We used the BlueJ platform to code in schools. I still feel like I learned no heavy or important stuff in that language. 
I'm not very keen in coding and computer science, in general. That comes from the fact that I always scored fair or low marks in my tests and felt like an idiot infront of bright kids. And I never did a project or built a software in my course (it was there but no one really cared for your real efforts). 
But sometimes, I find myself getting excited to do a problem or think about a logic for a piece of code. From my high school experience, programming was both a good and bad experience. It was good because I developed methodical nature, procedural way of solving and diffused thinking. It was bad because I had to memorize a few code pieces for implementation of same kind of programs, low confidence due to constant failure in coming up with new or better logics and my poor/slow typing skills (I am really ashamed of this in particular). 
Now, I want to expand and solidify my old concepts in Java and learn another language Python. I tried to look on EdX for a course, but there are so many for beginners. So I am confused about how and where to begin with. 
Can anyone please tell me more about this? I will also appreciate any other advices or criticisms.

TLDR

I am a freshman at a very small liberal arts college for CS and Mathematics, and I am very torn on whether to transfer schools or not. Here is some of my reasons to transfer and not to transfer, in no particular order of importance. Of course, the goal of college, in my view, is to meet people who I can have long term beneficial connections with as well as get a high paying job, or even better, make a great, successful living being self-employed.

  
Reasons not to transfer:

1.) I am at the top of the class. Have already taken Data Structures and Algorithms, OOP, Computer Architecture, Differential Equations, Linear and Abstract Algebra. Lowest grade I have so far in my college career is a 96.

2.) Faculty loves to work with me, as do I with them. At one point, one of my professors told me that he feels guilty as a teacher because he feels like he is getting paid to do nothing as I get the concepts quickly and breeze by his tests.

3.) As a result of reason 1 and 2, I have had some (when I mean some, I mean so far only one) insider opportunities. My CS adviser recommended me for an internship of which he told he would never do especially for a freshman. In addition, the CS faculty knows of only one alum who goes to a FANG, Big 4 company. They always keep talking about her, and saying big statements about how they can connect me with her and in terms get in me to work at her company.

4.) Small class sizes make learning easier. I am well-known in the school to be acing junior-level classes. If I were to transfer, then I ***may*** lose the luxury of standing out in the class as well as having such a good, personal relationship with the professors.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons to transfer:

1.)  Prestige and connections makes the job search easier. There is a higher probability to get those insane paying jobs at brand name colleges.

2.) Difficulty of the courses. I am pretty sure my current CS and Math classes are heavily influenced by the class. Meaning to say that many of my classmates do not grasp the concepts as quickly and thus the class is slower paced/assigns easier homework assignments (relative to what I know and what I consider is easy/challenging)

3.) Teachers acknowledge that I am not challenged in their classes; despite getting a recommendation for an internship as well as being admired heavily by faculty, I don't see any other support systems or opportunities that they are giving me that will help advance my career. (as a freshman, maybe I'm just being impatient and haven't seen everything yet; maybe I'm just expecting too much. I don't know)

3.) There is little to no exciting CS/Math environment; my school's career fair were geared towards military, actuarial, and health sciences. There was only one booth that had something slightly connected to computer programming. In addition, the CS and MATH club is very inactive. When they do have activities, its similar to what you see in high school: making pie on pi day (that's the only event both clubs ever had, so I can't list any more for you as examples)

4.) I am a TA for some of the introductory CS classes. In addition, I tutor as a part-time job. I can say that I spend an average of 12 hours a week helping students out. The amount of time I spend helping others out starts to bog me down; rather than collaborating with classmates on projects I want to do, instead, I am helping them understand rudimentary concepts and help them pass the class. I don't feel like I'm advancing my career/knowledge. 

5.) There are very, very few competent CS/Math students at my school. I'm not saying this because I have a superiority complex. I'm saying this because the majority of my classmates  statistically do not do well on exams or assignments despite having a very small class size, and long open professor office hours. The majority of my classmates have the ""C's get degrees"" mentality and I can't find anyone (except for one) who is self-motivated enough to create things for the sake of creating things you can be proud of. In addition, I watched the senior capstone CS projects, and I was a little underwhelmed by what they had created in the course of a whole semester. Although the projects were not rudimentary, they were not anything a self-taught programmer could do in the same amount of time, if not better.

\------------

I know that the name (and its respective academic rigor) of a school is not everything. I've read posts here where people's passion for CS has brought them to great opportunities, jobs, etc. In addition, I might have too much of a high/fantastical view of prestigious colleges as the key to the high-paying, very desirable jobs. I do enjoy being less stressed in school, spending a short amount of time on class work while still getting high grades, and having more time to do whatever I want (side projects, challenge myself with online classes). And despite sounding harsh on my reasons why I should transfer, the amount of attention and respect I'm getting is very uplifting for me and I do think the teachers do genuinely care about me and are very serious in getting me to good places. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I have friends that go to premier CS universities, and I definitely have FOMO when I compare their CS career fairs to my non-existent one, their problem sets versus my assignments, their class content versus my class content. They're going to FANG, Big 4 internships, while it took me 500+ internship applications to land one at a small local business. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a love hate relationship with my current school. It's a place that boosts my confidence that I can grasp what ever will be given to me. It's also a place where that is not rigorous enough to advance my career goals, and I must find ways to supplement this myself through Leetcode, side projects, etc.

I was hoping to get some input from those with experience on how to enter the CS industry. My current plan is taking major prep courses at SMC to transfer into UCLA for a CS Bachelors. However this involves heavy courses on physics and calculus, which I'm not too talented in as subjects and I'm not sure how beneficial they actually are in the long run.

I'm considering instead to pursue an AA degree at the community college which would involve less math and science, less time, and less money. 

Some people have also recommended taking a boot camp, which I'm very interested in as an option because I'd honestly prefer to learn CS skills upfront rather than in pieces. It'd also save a lot on time and money. My only concern is how I'd be affected competitively as a candidate in the field.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks",8,1

Hi Community!

I have never used Reddit but seems like it could be a valuable tool. I am working on graduate project and I have found the best way to convey my capstone information is through a database. I have built the layout on Excel for template purposes. The database has to be a place where contributions can become members by signing up and posting. I have setup a URL via GoDaddy around December (90 day grade period before I can transfer).

Can someone share how/where they have made a database and posted it live for users to contribute? 

A little background of me is this is for a Technology Management degree and I have little to no programming experience. I am hoping to find a user friendly area.

The extent of the database will be (for example): 

Year  Month  Day  Breed  Activity  Food  Live in Friends  Consumption

Each area will be limited to specific data, for example there will only be specific breeds one can chose and same for the rest. Year would only go back 20 years. From there all information should be filterable from the following actions Year  Month  Day  Breed

I've always loved CS and I try to learn as much as I can without pursuing a degree. That being said there is at least one huge gaping hole that I'm aware of in my education so far. And part of the problem is I'm not even sure what exactly am I looking for. And so I will try to describe what I'm looking for in hopes that someone here will be kind enough to point me in the right direction. Here it goes:

I don't know anything about **networks**. Neither the physical side nor the software side of it. I don't know what **http** really is and how is it different from **ftp**, **ssh**, **TCP** etc. and how much these differences are relevant for a website. I don't know what's a **socket**, how do **DNS** function, how many are there and how can one benefit from the existence of more than one... And so on and so on.

I hope you get the picture. The reason I'm writing such a disorganized plea for help is because I'm truly lost on where to start. Is all of this covered in textbooks about networking in a way that I could understand it? Or is this too broad and basic for a **Networking 101**. I tried many times to get into it through tutorials, wikipedia chains and countless  while tinkering with network problems on Linux. But I never got to the basic enough level to feel like a have a whole picture. IP address, DNS, WWW those are all things I think I could define properly but at the same time I lack a basic understanding of the relationships between all the different layers of technology, frameworks and the common usage in all of these.

I would gladly pick up a textbook (I sure do love textbooks!) but I don't even now where to start. So my question is: what even am I asking about, i.e. what would be the best way to describe the subject matter? Are there any beginner friendly resources you recommend? Finally how would the answers change if I admitted I'm thinking about pursuing a career in web development?

I have a question about being able to self-study computer science.

I'm not talking about learning to program or networking,I've already paid them a visit.

A little back story. I'm 19 and I will be entering university this year. I plan to study theoretical physics because I absolutely love it. But the thing is, I also love computer science to a degree.

Throughout highschool I was totally engaged in learning as much as I could about cs, i learnt a lot of programming languages(C,C++,PHP,Python,C# and VB(regret it since I'm on Linux), Bash Scripting, A little bit of Assembly) and i took courses on networking(Net+, A little ccna(Never got to actually taking the test)) and some LPIC. my major passion was with Network Security(CEH , SEC+ , A lot of self studying) and Exploiting.

Last year I had an important year at school and I got some eye problem that prevented me from seeing objects close-up(so no books, no computer) so i completely set aside my cs studies and most of my school work(i had a doctor's note).

Now that I'm on a gap-year my eyes have been better and I can start doing it again(I forgot a lot and I'm planning to remember most of it + new things).

So my question is, Will i be able to reach a rather deep understanding in this field through studying by myself at my free time? Or is it mandatory for me to be a cs university student?

If yes how do i start on hard subjects such as Operating Systems and Logic Circuits and ...?

Should i just read the books that cs students read? Should i take any classes?

Thanks everyone for your time and sorry for my post being long.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: Although it would be nice if i could land a job in the cs field, I do it mostly for passion and interest, so not having a certified degree is not that much of an issue, plus i can attempt to get one after my main major is finished.",1,1

The startup iExec is launching on May 15 its V3.0 ([today at 4pm UTC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfIThShzefQ)) that will address the needs of neural network data used in AI. You can also make use of other people's datasets to build your models, and mobilize scalable and on-demand computing power to train them. There is no need to own and maintain your own servers.

iExec is compatible with TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, or Scikit-Learn.",3,1

So, I'd like to start with saying that when I was young or say when I was in a phase of life where I had to choose my career, I wasn't serious and due to that I never put thought into what I have to do with my life. So, I ended up doing what others advised me to do and did my bachelors in Businesses Administration. During my study, I realised that it's really not my thing. I was already a kinda guy who wasn't serious about my studies and on the top of that I didn't like the subjects.

Before I proceed,  when I was young I always loved computers, I did a lot of tweaking and playing around with my father's computer and by the time I was grown up, I became expert in computer troubleshooting and general hardware knowledge, and I loved it. 

Okay, back to the future, so during my bachelors my mother gifted me a laptop. After a while, I came across CodeAcademy, I started with HTML then proceeded to Java. And man, that was the time I realised I can do this all day. I purchased books and took online courses on coding, I couldn't keep a track of time while I was learning to code. Imagine, a guy who couldn't study for an hour straight is now studying for hours and on. It was then I realised this is what I wanna do. 

But the thing is, I realised that too late, I was already in my final year and the problem is that in my country shifting career is not possible, what you took in your college will decide what you are gonna do in your life. But I don't wanna do that, not at any cost. I wanna do my masters in Computer Science. I have almost developed Generalized Anxiety Disorder thinking about this. 

Now the thing is I need advice from people in this field. 

As I cannot pursue my Masters in CS in my country I did a lot of research. 

I came across various courses which don't require you to have CSE in your bachelors. 

In the US : Master's program in universities like uChicago, uPensylvania, NYU and few others

In  UK : something knows as Conversion Masters in universities like UCL (but the course module is weak)

In Australia, there's a course in ANU.

Now the problems with these options:

1. As I told you I wasn't serious about my studies during my early stages and therefore I have a very poor academic profile, and for almost all of these universities I need to have a strong profile. 

2. It will cost me a lot, so much that I will repay the loan till my midlife. 

3. Toughest competition, when it comes to the admission competitors to these universities, I am a very weak contender, guys have papers published or have already taken projects and I have none of that. 

4. I can't decide of it's a good option considering the investment, I don't know what's the ROI for people who shift careers like this. 

Guys I sincerely need your advice what to do about my situation. I don't have a lot of time. I am almost 23 and my parents are pushing me hard to do a masters in Business. I need to decide quickly. Please tell me about every possible route I can take to enter the field of Computer Science or something closely related.",16,2

I am now majoring in computer science but havent taken any cs class yet. I know a tiny bit of introductory stuff of programming like java and python and just a tad bit of  general knowledge of computer science.

I love science a lot and I like learning how things work on all levels. I really enjoyed biology and physics and I thought I was going to major in electrical engineering. I decided not to because software engineers/developers are in so much more demand than electrical engineers and I feel like electrical engineers have to stay in school longer than most. Im pretty confident that I will like computer science and would like to be a software engineer in the future. Physics or biology would have been a cool major too but Im just tryna get a job. 

However, Im wondering if computer science will quench that thirst of mine, so to speak, of learning how things work. It seems like computer science is mostly about programming and isnt really science but idk I dont want to sound ignorant since I dont know much about it at all. 

So yeah, has studying computer science satisfied your love of learning how things work? Is computer science really science?
Im pretty sure I know what youll probably reply so Im kinda just looking for inspiration, insight, and advice that will make me more confident that I chose the right major lol.",7,4

Im just looking for advice because I know I eventually do want to be a true data analyst/scientist and not just an entry level analyst working in excel 24/7.

There are many use cases for service workers. However, from a purely caching point of view, does it makes sense to use the Cache API?

Many approaches make assumptions of how resources will be handled. Often only the URL is used to determine how the resource should be handled with strategies such as Network first, Network Only, Stale-while-revalidate, Cache first and Cache only. This can be tedious work, because you have to define a specific handler for many URLs. It's not scalable.

Instead I was thinking of using regular HTTP cache in combination with the Cache API. Response headers contain useful information that can be used to cache and verify if the cache can still be used or if a new version would be available. Together with best practice caching (for example [https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/)), this could create a generic service worker that has not te be updated when resources change. Based on the response headers, a resource could be handled by a custom handler. If the headers would ever be updated, it would be possible to handle the resource with a different handler if necessary.

But then I realised, I was just reimplementing browser cache with the Cache API. This would mean that the resources would be cached double (take this with a grain of salt), by storing it in both the browser and the service worker cache. Additionally, while the Cache API provides more control, most handlers can be (sort of) simulated with http cache:

* Network only: Cache-Control: no-store
* Cache only: Cache-Control: immutable
* Cache first: Cache-Control: max-age with validation (Etag, Last Modified, ...)
* Stale-while-revalidate: Cache-Control: stale-while-revalidate

I don't immediately see how to simulate network first, but then again this would imply support for offline usage (or bad connection). (Keep in mind, this is not the use case I'm looking for). While it's always useful to provide a fallback (using service workers &amp; Cache API), is it worth having the resources possibly cached double and having copied the browser's caching logic? I'm aware that the Cache API can be used to precache resources, but I think these could also be precached by requesting them in advance.

Lastly, I know the browser is in charge of managing the browser cache and a developer has limited control over it (using HTTP Cache headers). But the browser could also choose to remove the whole service worker cache to clear disk space. There are ways to make sure the cache persists, but that's not the point here.

My questions are:

* What advantages has the Cache API that can't be simulated with regular browser cache?
* What could be cached with the Cache API, but not with regular browser cache?
* Is there another way to create a service worker that does not need to be updated",0,0

Im currently not happy with my work and I want a career change to something in the programming field. Fullstack Academy is a Bootcamp I found and I gave the prep class a shot before I threw a huge amount of money at it. 

So I just finished the Fullstack prep Bootcamp yesterday and although I learned a lot and picked up what I learned pretty easily (thanks engineering school for the amazing problem solving skills), Ive ultimately decided that maybe I should not continue with the FullStack Bootcamp due to the layout of their part time course.

I unfortunately cannot quit my job so part time is my only option, and their part time class focuses heavily on self study (aka you studying on your own) with a couple of part time classes per week. Compared to the full time class which is literally a 40 hour full time job per week, the part time is basically me paying to teach myself. Because of this, theres very little reason for me to throw all that money to do what I would have done at home anyway. I also work very well with teachers as opposed to learning on my own which is why I wanted to take a class in the first place vs self study. At least this is the mentality I have and not sure if this is the correct one. 

Aside from the obvious which is just continuing to practice at home and teach myself, what other options or resources are available for a person like me who already has another job. Im willing to pay for things so long as they actually have me paying for something. Even other Bootcamps would be good too so long as their part time program isnt just me sitting at home. Im still thinking about if I should just do the part time class with Fullstack and just make the best out of it but I have 2 days left to decide and would love some advice. Thank you.",2,1

I have a general idea of why this happens. This could happen because i start working on a task without fully understanding what needs to be done. I also often rely on a tool or piece of software without fully familiarizing myself with it and it's limitations. I also refactor my code to make it cleanier before I even finish it.

No one on the team has time to explain something to me, or to answer my questions. The code is completely devoid of comments, and full of variables with completely misleading names. The (little) documentation present is not technical, and is localized in a language other than that used in the code.

I'm starting to get deadlines on things to do in the project, without even being told WHAT I should do.

The office is in a giant open space where we work at least 50 people. Colleagues spend an exaggerated amount of time talking ill of one another.

My question specifically is, for which set of basic functions is O notation total, that is if f(n) != O(g(n)), g(n) must be in O(f(n)).

This is trivially not the case if you take all functions, since sinx!=O(cosx) and cosx!=O(sinx).
And you can create functions with similar behaviours. On the other side if you only allow polynomials O is trivially total.

It would appear that if you only allow either sin or cos and polynomials you do get a total system, since sinx and cosx are both in O(1) and sin^nx*p(x) where p is a polynomial is in O(p(X)).

It would also appear that a^x can also be added without disruption anything, but I don't have a proof for that.

So what do you guys think?  Anything I can do with this other than dispose of it properly?  Thanks!",0,0

I live in India and plan on applying to Europe/US colleges, at the time of choosing my bachelor's degree, i wasnt sure which field to pursue and so i chose to pursue Biotechnology from a good university as the cut-off for CS was way too high(I did not want to take a gap year and wasnt sure about my interest in CS)

That was in 2015, fast forward 4 years and I am graduating this month and want to pursue a master's in CS down the line. 

I pursued CS electives as well as alot of projects during my undergrad including an Internship as a software developer which led to a good job offer as well where I'll be working as a full time Employee from August.

My GPA in biology related subjects is quite low(~2.5)
Whereas in Math and Computer Science related subjects it's around 3.7

My GRE Score is 331

I have taken the basic courses of math, programming, Algorithms design analysis, Data Structures, Database Management Systems, Computer Networking, Intoduction to Robotic Systems, Probability, Computational Biology. All these were University offered electives and I have much better grades in these and was the course topper in ADA and Comp. Bio. 
I also have letters of recommendations from my professors of Computational Biology as well as my thesis  mentor.

I have done a few small projects in front end development and back end development and have a pretty good extra curricular profile(Leadership roles, clubs, had my own start up, etc)

Now I am not sure about pursuing a masters yet. Since I dont have a particular field of interest yet and wanted to work for a couple of years and then maybe apply. I am sure that I do not want to pursue biology ahead and would want to go into a Core CS field.

I wanted to know what are my options, given my low GPA and Non-CS background. Do I even have a chance at any good universities? What should I do if I want to pursue a masters a year or two from now and what would your advice be for me? 

I would be really grateful for some help! Thank you!",2,11

562,2019-5-23,2019,5,23,18,bs0miv,Back at it again with the logics,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/bs0miv/back_at_it_again_with_the_logics/,Pseudoo_,1558602253,"So, a while back I posted to this subreddit with some circuit design I had done to create a 16 bit calculator (See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/948usj/my_bare_bone_16_bit_calculator/)). Since then however I've been experimenting more and more with logics and I've come to a very simple CPU circuit that's fully functional, although the programs that I've written so far have been very small.

Here's the entire circuit from a top down:[https://imgur.com/a/oMH3iF0](https://imgur.com/a/oMH3iF0)

Obviously this project took quite a lot of time (Seeming as I was teaching myself a lot of this and guessing things as I went), I've probably invested 50+ hours into this. So, let's start looking at a break down of what I've got in this calculator.

The central clock has a period of 250ms (Much smaller values would be ideal but the simulation at hand doesn't allow for them) and each operation within the CPU actually takes two cycles. This is more down to a fact within the program and how it handles the connections inbetween frames (I could be mistaken however). This computer also offers up 16 bytes of memory + 4 bytes of temporary storage dotted around.

So what can we actually see from the top level circuit?  
[https://imgur.com/a/HvF9ZNE](https://imgur.com/a/HvF9ZNE)  
 \- Black = Program Counter  
 \- Blue = Program  
 \- Red = Main Memory (16 Bytes)  
 \- Green = Register (1 Byte I commonly call this register R)  
 \- Purple = ALU (Contains three of its own single Byte registers I'll be referring to as C\_1, C\_2 and C\_a)

I don't intend on going into too much detail on some of the specs as I'd like to spend this coming summer going over all of the work I did and attempting another few versions in an attempt to perfect it.

Program Counter:

The circuit I devised for the program counter is as follows:

 [https://imgur.com/a/vRimcOc](https://imgur.com/a/vRimcOc) 

This is the timer that counts through the memory addressess of the program that's currently ""installed"" in the CPU. The programs essentially work as 1 Byte memory pieces (Which I'll talk about more). So four bits of the ripple timer are dedicated to the address of the current instruction and the remaining bit essentially serves to buffer the current parameter which is a fix for an issue rooted primarily with the simulation software. I also wanted it to have the ability to be set to a specific value by the program in hand. This, still has many issues as of right now however and is not what I'd call functional.

The Program:

 [https://imgur.com/a/dgJE9LD](https://imgur.com/a/dgJE9LD) 

This is how a program would look, essentially just an address bar that points to different binaric values. These are the instruction. The instructions I've chosen for my IL are 4-bit opcodes with 4 bit arguments for some.

 \- 0000 - Null: Does nothing  
 \- 0001 - Put: Puts the argument in R (Register mentioned before)  
 \- 0010 - CLR: Clears the memory address (Address is given as argument)  
 \- 0011 - CLR\_R: Clears R  
 \- 0100 - SHIFT: Takes a value from memory (Argument) and puts it in R  
 \- 0101 - PULL: Takes the value in R and put it in memory (Address from argument)  
 \- 0110 - CLR\_C1: Clears C1  
 \- 0111 - CLR\_C2: Clears C2  
 \- 1000 - CLR\_CA: Clears CA  
 \- 1001 - LOAD\_C1: Loads a memory address (Argument) into C1  
 \- 1010 - LOAD\_C2: Loads a memory address (Argument) into C2  
 \- 1011 - MATH: Argument determines addition/subtraction (0000 or 0001), performs operation over C1 and C2 and saves to CA  
 \- 1100 - SAVE: Saves the value of CA to a memory address (Argument).

Main Memory:

 [https://imgur.com/a/JnOR3hN](https://imgur.com/a/JnOR3hN)   
 [https://imgur.com/a/gXAS3ql](https://imgur.com/a/gXAS3ql)

Main memory isn't very inspiring honestly, it's just all stacked/nested to make the handling of it easier for me! Nothing overtly complicated here.

The primary thing with handling the memory and the various registers is the flow of data.  So, this features two bus loops.

 [https://imgur.com/a/FZAmIQl](https://imgur.com/a/FZAmIQl) 

The above loop allows for moving data back and forth between main memory and R (We can't move values from R into C1 or C1, and whilst it's possible to move data from CA to R I've not done this as I've never had a need).

 [https://imgur.com/a/kP2yNDD](https://imgur.com/a/kP2yNDD)

This loop allows us to move data from main memory into C1/C2 and from CA back into Main Memory.

The ALU:

 [https://imgur.com/a/dTnzxN3](https://imgur.com/a/dTnzxN3) 

This is essentially the same as the ALU that I featured in my calculator previously with a few improvements however. One of which being the support for subtraction by using 2s complement!

I'm currently studying the core CS classes at my local community college in preparation for Georgia Tech's online MS CS (OMSCS) program starting (hopefully) next Fall (2020). I have a previous degree in engineering (non-CS) but I'm currently working on CS courses to beef up my background ahead of the program.

By the end of this year, I'll have completed the following five CS courses in preparation for applying to GT: discrete math, intro CS (using C++), C++ data structures, objects &amp; algorithms (using C++), and intro to computer organization &amp; architecture.

I'm planning on specializing in the machine learning track at GT, but I've gotten really interested in c++ so far through my studies and would like to do some electives in the computer systems area, as well as a couple of software dev classes to round it out (I'll prob end up taking an extra 1-2 classes beyond the required 10).

Regarding the aforementioned intro to CO &amp; Arch class (slated for Fall 2019), I scoped out the textbook (Lobur &amp; Null - Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture) and it seems to cover decent ground in terms of fundamentals but at a pretty rudimentary level. It doesn't involve any C/C++ programming, and focuses mostly on programming in simplified pseudo-assembly language developed by the authors called ""MARIE,"" which also runs in a VM application/GUI written in (i think) Java. 

So my question is, do you think it would be beneficial to get some deeper background in this subject beyond this ""basic"" course ahead of GT? In particular, for the intro operating systems course in the GT program (as well as the distributed systems &amp; parallel computing courses I'd like to eventually take), it seems like a deeper understanding would be helpful. In particular, I was looking in the ballpark of textbooks like Computer Science: A Programmer's Perspective (Bryant &amp; O'Hallaron) and Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface (Patterson and Hennessy), but not sure which would be more appropriate. I was leaning more towards CSAPP (along with related CMU lectures and lab assignments), since it seems more focused on the computer systems side and incorporates a lot of C &amp; C++, but I'm having trouble figuring out where the overlap is with a more architecture focused text/course like that of CO&amp;D (and related courses that would use this type of textbook).

Hi everyone!

I'm currently doing the 4th year of CS BA and working my first job as Java developer (almost 5 months).

The  project I'm in is almost 6 years old. My day-to-day tasks are bug fix  and adding new stuff. But it's usually not something serious: it could  be add a new if-condition, refactor DB table, remove some code etc.

Unfortunately  I realised that probably this isn't my thing: I'm not interested in  learning new things like during the weekend, sometimes I write shitty  code, sometimes it's stupid copy-paste where I can copy-paste something  old and not refactor it at all. Also I do tasks quite slowly sometimes  and my colleagues are kinda pressing me for that thinking I'm doing  nothing but I'm trying my best!

Also  my mind is all about patterns: I'm good at solving tasks I've solved  before but if it's same task but with a little different wording I may  not recognize I should solve it the same way.

And  recently I started thinking of moving myself into another field which  is Big Data. I think I'm especially interested in becoming a Data  Analyst. **BUT**

1. I'm not the best-best with maths, especially abstract ones. Though I'm kinda ok when there're numbers :D
2. It's  kinda of hard with Big Data jobs in my region, especially Junior ones.  So I'd either have to move to another one or move to another country  (European preferrably). And this current job gives quite good money  which I'd lose if I switch. Just like kiind of stability with Java dev  job ads.
3. I'd  have to self-educate with coursera/udemy/whatever which basically would  be everything I have in my background since there're no internships  (see 2). Also may need to hire a tutor to help with maths but only if I  have enough money because sometimes I may not understand things myself  and need help.
4. Looks  like I don't have much of analytical/critical thinking. Also I have  sometimes weak attention (like may not notice some mistake).
5. My  soft-skills aren't the best :( Also I prefer reading info rather than  listening and get tired and bored of boring conversations easily (and  don't like talking lots myself). Aaaand sometimes I easily give up when  there're difficulties so it takes me some time to cool down and try  again. So I have a rather ""fixed"" mindset.

Also  I plan to do master's degree in CS so in order to study BD I'd have to  leave the current job since I come home absolutely tired and have only  weekends to do things. But since MA also has homework to do there'd be  no time for BD left.

So  I wanted to know your opinion if I should go to the other field or no?  It seems interesting to me that you can answer lots of questions using  same data, it seems like solving puzzles to me. But on the other hand  I'm afraid my mind is not the best for this type of tasks (see the  points like maths). So I'm struggling since it's such a huge risk.  But  I'm also afraid that I'm doing more or less ok just on this job and if I  get another one as dev where I have to implement new things it'll be  hard for me cause sometimes I can't think of all the possibilities in  the future to design something well of apply the best practices.",1,2

I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and was wondering what are the best career options for me. 

Im 24 and have recently decided to travel abroad (Germany perhaps) to get a Masters degree in a specific field. The only problem is that Im not sure which field I should take. 

To give a bit of background information: Ive been working as a marketing data analyst for the past 2 years and I havent really been doing any analysis work. My work usually includes making reports and fetching certain data from large databases (basic SQL stuff). But I have been looking into data analysis and I find it quite interesting and something Id like to specialize in the future. In college, another one of my favorite subjects was software engineering and have always found it fascinating. 

I enjoy coding and would say that Im fairly decent at it. So I guess my question is what, in your opinion, would you suggest as a good field to specialize in? What are the fields that are up and coming and would be a wise move to get into? I understand that one should always do what they like but Im genuinely confused because theres no one field Im inclined to. 

Also, the main reason for me to do my masters abroad in a place like Germany because its financially possible for me to do that. Masters in a place like USA is not possible for me. I also believe that unless I go abroad for masters I wont be able to get a job in a different place and I would very much like to leave the place I am right now. 

So, what field is the most interesting to specialize in? Cyber Security? Data Analysis? Software Engineering? Any thing else?

Thus far, I am on section 2 lesson 19 for the Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python &amp; R In Data Science and I am loving it. My only concern is that I am able to follow everything that the instructor is doing, but as soon as I am not looking at his code and I am trying to do it on my own from scratch, I am not able to remember the code. If I was to be given a similar task, I would need to look at previous code to complete the given task. This does not feel right, I do not know if this is normal as an aspiring machine learning engineer. Your input is well appreciated.

I just finished up my 3rd year of CS and was not able to lock down an internship for this summer.  This is most likely because I had a stressful spring semester and i was a bit late to applying for them.  Anyways, I have one more summer left before I graduate and would like some advice on how to get an internship in my situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

I expect my GPA to be around a 3.0 (probably a 2.85-2.90 if Im being honest) and I havent had any professional experience to speak of.  Whenever I apply for internships or interview, the company seems to expect, or act surprised at the fact that I have not had a professional job yet.  This always bothered me because I'm not quite sure how they can expect a 20 year old college student to have already had 2 jobs! After all, thats what the internship is for, isnt it?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I've been on plenty of interviews, I've done well in my CS classes, I have a good number of skills and tools under my belt, and yet here I am working in a kitchen after my junior year.  If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation, I would more than appreciate some wisdom.

Hello, I opted for a BA instead of Bsc because I was transferring from another college and taking a BSC would require an additional year to my degree which I think is a waste of money and I prefer the more flexible elective requirement that arts provides.

The main difference between science and arts is calc 2 (Integral), calc 3 (multivariate calc), and stats probability all of which I took and I'm also even taking several courses related to statistics and machine learning since I found my passion lies between this topics. I also had a research assistant position with my professor over the summer (on similar topics) and I am currently in a top 40 university in CS if that's relevant and having a relatively good grade (for a Canadian university).

Would it be detrimental for my grad school application due to my BA degree ?. Not that I would directly apply for one, since I would want to work for a year or 2 before continuing with a masters most likely in Machine learning or more applied Computer Science field such as HCI.",3,1

After university I worked in a child-based recreational therapeutic environment where I designed and implented programs for children with medical disabilities, but the company was a complete shit and after 2 years I had advanced as far as I could. Then they shut down my program, and I have worked retail the past few years while looking at other jobs as well as other career options.

  
I've always loved computers, but as a kid never was as heavily into computers but did mess around a bit with basic stuff like Ubuntuu and Arch Linux (although that was a while ago and I've forgotten a large amount of the langauge) but never got any further than that. I've been going through some stuff like the Harvard CS50 online videos as well as other stuff, but know that this is barely even a foothold for stepping into everything.

That said, I've always loved the computer science world, but always felt intimated as math was never my strong subject.

I am currently a student getting my MS in health economics, but after having done some work in this field - I don't think it's what I aspire to do as a career. I believe I want to pursue a master's in cybersecurity engineering - as I think the healthcare field is important, but I do not feel fulfilled with my current role/business description.

Enough of my background, I just had some questions for you all:

Would it be worth going back to school to get a BS in comp sci before I try for a MS in cybersec eng? The reasons I'm wary of this topic is the cost and the time investment. The upside to it is it gives me a greater foundation/chance of being accepted into a program.

If I choose not to pursue option 1, how could I go about a way to receive professional accreditation/certification for the following areas: 
C, C++, or Java
Data structures
Analysis of algorithms
Discrete structures
Operating systems
Computer organization
Software design
These are the requirements set out as having baccalaureate knowledge of for some of the programs I have been looking at.
The positive to finding something credible to teaching these is: I can go at my own pace, their should be less time investment, and it is probably cheaper. The downside is it may not be recognized by an institute, and may not make me competitive.

I started my CS major last semester and just finished my first ever C++ class (first half of it Ill take second half this summer.) 

After taking the class I still feel kinda lost. Our last two topics were functions and arrays and I still feel like I cant do array problems. This kinda worries me because I hope Im prepared for the next course and this is supposed to be really basic right? Shouldnt I be getting it by now ? I passed the class with a B only and I feel like I know a lot less than I do. 

My professor was kinda shitty and made me dread the class which kinda sucks cuz I enjoy math and csc a lot. I want to say a lot of me not learning was because of him but maybe I didnt work hard enough? Am I overreacting ? Lol What can I do throughout summer to get better with C++?

Ill take any advice I can get thanks!",5,3

The best definition I have heard that anyone can understand was in this interview with Steve Jobs

Its a well-known fact that even without any formal engineering training, Steve Jobs had an unmatchable understanding of technology.

Here is how the interview went on

***Jeff Goodell:*** *Would you explain, in simple terms, exactly what object-oriented software is?*

***Steve Jobs:*** *Objects are like people. Theyre living, breathing things that have knowledge inside them about how to do things and have a memory inside them so they can remember things. And rather than interacting with them at a very low level, you interact with them at a very high level of abstraction, like were doing right here.*

*Heres an example: If Im your laundry object, you can give me your dirty clothes and send me a message that says, Can you get my clothes laundered, please. I happen to know where the best laundry place in San Francisco is. And I speak English, and I have dollars in my pockets. So I go out and hail a taxicab and tell the driver to take me to this place in San Francisco. I go get your clothes laundered, I jump back in the cab, I get back here. I give you your clean clothes and say, Here are your clean clothes.*

*You have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. Maybe you speak French, and you cant even hail a taxi. You cant pay for one, you dont have dollars in your pocket. Yet, I knew how to do all of that. And you didnt have to know any of it. All that complexity was hidden inside of me, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction. Thats what objects are. They encapsulate complexity, and the interfaces to that complexity are high level.*

Cognitive science is a multidisciplinary field where psychiatrists, neurologists, computer scientists, and others try to understand the nature of human thought. Computer scientists are particularly interested in this field because understanding human thought is helpful in the field of artificial intelligence as well as human-computer interaction.

The cognitive theories behind Object Oriented Programming have been in existence for decades. In fact, the first object-oriented programming languages started to appear in the 1960s, but at the time were not very popular. It is only recently (in the last 15 years or so) that object-oriented programming has become popular.

C++ is so compatible with C that you often see it as C/C++ or C,C++ and can take a file made in C, make it a cpp file, and itll still run. This is why Bjourne Stroustrup (the creator) once said that some people try to use C++ as a C but with some more features, but thats not the correct way to use it. C++ is fast and allows the creation of objects and how they relate to one another. It does a lot of what could be done in C for you to make your life easier. Due to its speed and objects, its often the best choice to make video games and operating systems in.

The answer goes to the heart of what object-oriented programming (OOP) is all about. A great deal of academic fluff has been written about this, but it is not useless to say that its all about data abstraction, which means you define a class (a general type of object) not by its internal structure but by what it does.

But to stick with the very practical and obvious, a member function for class CFoo can do everything that a function that refers to a CFoo can do, plus

* One obvious advantage is that every class can have a function of the same name, such as draw() for example; I dont have to have separate functions such as draw\_Square(), draw\_Circle(), draw\_Point(), etc. The right form of draw is automatically called depending on what kind of object it applies to. This is a way of controlling the proliferation of the namespace, at least.
* Another advantage is that member functions of a particular class can access all internal private data, while the data is kept inaccessible to functions outside the class. Such an approach can prevent hidden dependencies creeping into the code  dependencies that cause many bugs whenever the internals of the class are revised.
* Member functions can also be the basis of *polymorphism*, a difficult concept to explain in a small space. But it means that you can use member functions as a general protocol or interface allowing you to call functions that may have unlimited implementations in the future by classes that arent even written yet! This approach decentralizes software and puts the implementation in the hands of objects  rather than requiring endless switch statements on the part of the main program.
