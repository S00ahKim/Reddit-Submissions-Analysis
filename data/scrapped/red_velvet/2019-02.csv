I had a pretty close P1 seat, but people a couple rows in front kept holding up their phones and banners blocking everyone's view behind them. They aren't even watching what they are filming. I didn't pay $230 for a seat to just see 10% of the what's on stage. I really should have complained to venue staff. I know it wasn't a great venue choice either. It was made for sitting viewing, but no one sits at a concert.


Please be considerate of others at the concert. Don't block other's view with phones and banners. Don't throw objects on stage. We all paid good money to see Red Velvet in person. We can buy professional Blu-rays of the concert performance later. Enjoy the moment! ",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Lets put all our thoughts and spazzing into this thread. Mods feel free to edit or remove this post if it violates anything or if I missed some sticky thread.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was in the 2nd concert in LA and holy crap was it an amazing experience. I've been to Kpop concerts before but this was my first solo act. I usually attend collab concerts like Kcon or SMTown, but this was on a different level and feel. Everyone's energy was high and the performance was electric. The fact that they all took time to learn some English and practice it was super sweet of them to do. Yeri I was especially impressed with as she would work through her thoughts and ask Wendy for some help. I apparently was dancing and cheering so much that the guy behind me said I was a hoot to be behind (specifically said I was hilarious in my accuracy with chants despite no one around me doing them). I was also surprised how many folks knew the B-side tracks. I had always loved RV b-sides but never had a chance to enjoy them until the concert. Glad I wasn't the only one. 

I was super impressed with all of their voices as well. I have not seen RV perform live before so it was great hearing Wendy belt out some high notes. I melted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Merch was a sad state as nothing was left day 2 of LA. Just some shirts and pins which I jumped on immediately. Hoping they improve it for the rest of the tour! Thankfully I already had a fanlight.",2,2,False,self,,,,,

I've only been to American concerts before red velvet and I've never seen anything like this.

With that being said maybe this is because they're in more smaller intimate concert settings? I was thinking this problem would go away once they start doing arena concerts (10-20k people) since their mics would be a lot louder and one person can't make their presence known.

Another pet peeve of mine is holding up the banners at the end... Im short and I literally could not see them perform, but at least it was for only the song day 1 so not a deal breaker.",93,113,False,self,,,,,

So I'll be attending the Toronto show tomorrow and I'm super excited!! However there are still a few things that I'm worried about or not sure of. 

1) So my first question is: was there a bag policy? I was thinking about bringing a backpack with me just to carry the lightstick and a few banners I made for people and myself. I heard there's lockers at the Toronto venue but that doesn't really help since I'll have my hands full in my seat.

2) As for banners, was there a restriction as to how big it can be? Or do they have to check it to confirm you can bring it in? The ones I made are a bit bigger than what the fansites were telling me but honestly it's only about 20% longer but 10% shorter. I don't plan on raising it up since I'll hopefully be in the first row, I can just hold it forward and the girls would still be able to see it.

3) This is the one I'm worried about the most and have been thinking about non stop. To those who paid the premium on StubHub for front row seats, were you able to get in without any problems? I'm super nervous about this. I've heard and seen the horror stories about tickets coming up as already scanned. I guess it happened at the Newark show, a ticket was deemed as ""refund"" when the person tried to get in. I understand you get a refund and they still get you a seat at the show but losing front row seats would be a day killer. I'm already planning on showing up super early just to avoid this.

I think that covers everything I'm curious about for the show tomorrow. I hope you all enjoyed yourselves!",7,3,False,self,,,,,

What. A. Night. My only problem is that I wish the show could have gone on forever...  
This was my first time seeing RV live. Upgraded last minute to 5th row seats. And I do not regret it at all.   
My first reaction in the opener? Mouth absolutely to the floor. Seeing them on a computer screen versus them in a real life incarnation just made me stare in awe. I couldn't believe they were right in front of me. And they are really THAT pretty. When I look back at my recording of the opener, RR, I legit still get shivers. 

Their connection to the audience is also amazing. They really tried to interact not just during the talking breaks, but also during the slower songs. Special shoutout to Yeri who made the talking breaks even more enjoyable, and also being more confident and shining on stage. F you OT4 fans. I really loved RV's attempt to speak English as much as possible. (Joy's English is adorable). Moreover, the audience etiquette this time in Newark was fantastic. Didn't see anything being thrown on stage, not much blatant interruption when they were talking compared to other cities. Just wonderful.

Anyways, Now I know why some people are doing a a big trip to see them multiple times. Goddamn, I wish I could watch them one more time to fully soak everything in again, especially since I recorded a lot of it and had to make sure my phone was aimed properly at them every so often.

I definitely will try my best to try to see them again. This was an opportunity I'm glad I did not pass up, since they are in their prime and they just happened to be performing pretty close to me. Thank you RV again for a memorable night!!!  


Other personal bonus Highlights (May contain spoilers):

I threw the finger/thumb heart sign at Seulgi (my bias) during About Love, Seulgi saw it and did it back. I also did it to Joy during the last talking session, and she acknowledged it and put her hand to her heart and smiled. Unfortunately both instances, i wasn't focusing on my camera (obviously, since I was looking at them during those golden moments), and in my recordings, my heart sign / hand was blocking them RIP. However, I see it confirmed in other fans' recordings :)

I choked twice at the opportunity to catch a signed ball. Both times the ball slipped out of my fingers. AHHHH",0,1,False,self,,,,,

I am interested to see how the results will differ in a smaller community, but one focused only on red velvet here in this sub.

This thread/poll will last for one week until 11:59 PM EST on Tuesday, February 26th. 

The rules are as follows:

- List your top 10 songs by Red Velvet in this format with number 1 being the best/your favorite - 
1. Song
2. Song
3. Song
4. Song
5. Song
6. Song
7. Song
8. Song
9. Song
10. Song

- Different Language versions of the same song will all be counted towards the same song (ex: Bad Boy English and Korean Versions will count towards the same thing)

- The points will be awarded where someone's number 1 song will receive 10 points, their number 2 will receive 9 points, and so on down to number 10 receiving 1 point towards the total tally. 

- Upvotes/Downvotes on someone's list will have no impact on the final tally but feel free to do so as you please

- You may reply to someone else's comment of you have something to say about their list but please make sure all original comments include a list. 

- As long as the song is an original Red Velvet song or OST including only RV members, it will be accepted. For example, Wow Thing would not count even though it includes Seulgi, as it is not a RV song, but Be Natural would count as it is their song.

- Lastly, just because a song isn't popular doesn't mean you shouldn't put it in your list. If you think the song is one of their top 10 songs then put it in your list. 


As stated earlier, the voting will end at 11:59 PM EST on Tuesday February 26th. The final results will be calculated on Wednesday, February 27th and posted on the subreddit so stay tuned for the results.

Im a newer Red Velvet fan and I didnt know they were in NA until a week or so before they came. I bought two front row tickets to the Vancouver show tonight because I couldnt split them. I relisted one to try to recoup some cost, but I dont think its going to sell. So, rather than lower the price, I wanted to give it away to someone on the sub who wanted to go but doesnt have tickets.

Every interaction Ive had on this sub has been positive so I figured I would pay it forward. All I ask is that you dont judge the sign that I made and I would be forever grateful if you helped me to get an autographed ball from Wendy. I promise I dont bite.

Anyway, just comment below for a chance to win. To prevent people entering multiple times with new accounts, Im looking for accounts older than three months and at least 50 karma. Ill work out logistics for delivery with the winner, but I want it to go to someone who will use the ticket, not someone who will just resell it. Im near the area where the concert is. Cutoff time will be 4:30 PST.

I know its a bit last minute, but I just got off of a flight from the US.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Bad Boy (418 points)

2) Kingdom Come (207 points)

3) Russian Roulette (197 points)

4) Dumb Dumb (159 points)

5) Red Flavor (151 points)

6) You Better Know (116 points)

7) I Just (103 points)

8/9) Tie between Butterflies and So Good (93 points)

10) Automatic (87 points)

&amp;#x200B;

Right on the bubble of the top 10 is Rookie (86 points) and One of These Nights (84 points).

&amp;#x200B;

To the surprise of pretty much no one, Bad Boy is the consensus best Red Velvet song by a *large* margin. Good to see half of the list is composed of B-sides though.

&amp;#x200B;

This was fun and interesting to do, I appreciate everyone's participation and maybe in the future I will do more community poll type posts. If you have any ideas you'd like to see let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you're wondering how a specific song not listed above did overall, drop a comment and I'll let you know. The post would be too long if I put the entire list in as there were a whopping ***68 UNIQUE SONGS*** from their discography mentioned throughout everyone's top 10's.",19,52,False,self,,,,,
