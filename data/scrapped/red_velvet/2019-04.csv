However, there are a lot of songs I struggle to categorize, due in large part to the fact I'm not super familiar with musical theory. Where does ""Somethin' Kinda Crazy"" fit as an homage to 2000's American pop? Or ""Sappy"" with its synth bassline and horns?

Moreover, it doesn't seem like any album is *purely* Red or Velvet. *The Red Summer* has ""Hear the Sea"" which seems to fit more as a Velvet song, and I might argue ""You Better Know"" is Velvet as well. Meanwhile, *Perfect Velvet* has ""Attaboy"", which I would consider closer to Red than Velvet.

Am I wrong about songs? Am I just overthinking this? Does it matter?

&gt;YERI: I think because I debuted at such young age, I got asked frequently ""what do you think will change the most when you turn 20?"" or ""what do you want to do when you turn 20?"" and at that time 20 was such an overwhelming concept to me, but once I became 20 nothing really changed. Rather, I think it was more of a time where I wasn't the best at comforting and looking back at myself. I wrote the song thinking about that.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. The mood of the song was bright, but I liked the warm feeling of the way you were comforting yourself**.  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: There is a line where it says ""you don't have to pretty yourself, you don't always have to be anxious"" and I think while I wrote that part of the song I got comforted by it a lot. I was in the professional's world since I was young that I had no time to look back at myself, and I was not good at it either. But maybe it's because of the little free time I have now that Ive been telling myself ""good job, thank you,"" and that Im proud of myself more than usual. I poured those feelings into the lyrics.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. I didn't know your lyrics skills were this outstanding, I was a bit shocked**.  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: To be honest, there is more work of my own that I haven't shown to anyone. I naturally took liking into writing lyrics because I like reading a lot, then I started putting a melody together with the lyrics and it was very fun. I feel very happy when I pass time while I am focused on that work. I am excited myself about the future stories I will be creating. One day, I want to show you people an album where I have poured my stories into.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. Red Velvet has definitely been expanding its ground yearly, do you feel it?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: It still doesnt feel real to me yet, but I do feel sometimes that ""our group has grown a lot"" and I felt it especially during the North America tour. Seeing everyone with different eye colour, hair colour, and even different language fill up the whole stadium made me feel a bit emotional. Whenever I experience something like that, I feel very proud and rewarded.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. Let's talk about your North America tour. I heard you covered 7 places in USA and Canada with sold out tickets and the heat was insane.**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: North America tour was such a dream to us. When we first heard the tour confirmation, we couldn't believe it. ""Can we really well carry out the stages throughout a whole month?"" half excited and half-worried, we couldn't sleep well. However, of course, because of our fans we were able to communicate together and have a lot of fun. Except two songs, we mostly sang in Korean, but everyone still sang along. It was such a thrilling and overwhelming experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. \[Having\] a US tour is a really big symbol \[of success\]. I think it's a really amazing outcome for Red Velvet.**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: In the US female solo artists have a lot of power. That's why I think our performance itself was a new experience for \[the Americans\] as well as us. With this tour I think it was an opportunity for us to engrave our strong and catchy songs into many American fans so I'm proud.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. Of all the cities you went on tour to, is there a city that's most memorable?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: We visited 7 cities on a short schedule. But still after rehearsal we went around visiting different corners of each city and spent \[our time\] well. I have memories popping up of each city but of course I think LA is the most memorable! It's a city that I've personally always liked and people I know live there so I was able to briefly meet them as well. It was such a good time.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. This trip is your first vacation in a while, right? How is the Hawaiian air?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: In the US I've visited LA a lot. Every time I go I always say I want to live there. Now that I've come to Hawaii it's so nice. The air is so fresh and the energy of the people here felt really warm. If I came and lived here I think my heart would automatically grow relaxed and the wounds on my heart would heal too.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. While traveling in Hawaii what was most impressionable?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: It was nice to spend time with the staff members who always work so hard beside me. Going to discover restaurants here and there was also memorable. I really can't forget the apple pasta we ate our first night! I am so thankful and happy for the times we spent laughing while chatting and eating good food.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. You guys have a lot of hit songs, but what's Yeri's ""one pick""?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: It has to be Rookie. Some might only remember the upbeat ""rookie rookie"" part, but to me it was special. Ever since the demo, I felt so energetic and motivated by this song. I think because of that special memory I am especially attached to the song. Even the performance suits me well.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. I feel that because Red Velvet has such power in their songs do you feel a lot of pressure every time you release a new song?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: It's definitely a lot of pressure. Because whenever there's a new song, the charting shows we definitely can't just not worry about it. However, we do realize that's not all, compared to the past the ""trust our fans and walk the path we want to walk"" has been in our mind a lot.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. As you carry your celebrity career, are there any philosophies or phrase/ determination you live by?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: My mother always tells me, ""Fame always fluctuates up and down"" so I try to live being aware of that. If I only live chasing fame, in the future I don't think I would be able to get a hold of what to do next. If I live while aware of the reality, I think at least I wouldn't end up putting myself through stress and difficulty.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. What do you do in your free time?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: Whenever I have free time, there's always a pattern. Guitar lessons, write lyrics, work on songs, read books, or watch dramas &amp; movies, morning to night in my bed. I also like listening to old songs.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. I have realised you have very broad fan base. You are even picked as the warmest member to fans.**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: I don't feel distance because of my age. My parents are on the younger side, and my mom and I are close just like friends, talking on the phone every day. She was very jealous of me being here today, she kept asking me what gift I was going to bring back for her (laugh). Anyways, for me especially unnies and oppas take care of me a lot. Rather than younger people, I think I fit better with older people; I even like and make good dad jokes! (Laugh)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. I think it's great that you debuted at your 10s and achieved your dreams.**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: I became a SM trainee in 5th grade, so I lived a very different life than people my age. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't hard. However, I think definitely, there were way more sense of achievement and worthy experiences, I gained. I was young and very competitive; I think the passion I learned at that time has contributed to my identity today. Even if I went back, I would have made the same decision.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. Do you have any special goal for this year?**  
&gt;  
&gt;YERI: First, being healthy! In addition, no matter how busy I am, consistently doing the things I like doing, like guitar and writing songs. I also want to exercise but it wasn't easy. I am on the weaker side where it's surprising that I have so much energy on stage. This year, I will build my endurance! Lastly, thank you to GRAZIA for giving me such a good time, I will never forget it! Love you!

I now listen to a lot of k-pop, including Mamamoo and Heize.

However, it makes me wonder if there's anything similar in western music? I have access to radio at work, but don't like to listen to k-pop when other employees are there. Not really ashamed, just know other people don't like listening to foreign lyrics.

Aside from Carly Rae's ""EMOTION"" and Lily Allen's ""Alright, Still"", I haven't really been into pop music. Which is to say, I don't really know anyone or where to look.

Any recommendations for songs or artists?
