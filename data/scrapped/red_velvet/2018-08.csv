After four long years, /u/thenerdal has decided to open up this subreddit for other users to post as they please.

With this change comes the addition of myself, /u/Pick_Me_15, and /u/handsupdb to the mod team. Before we completely open up this sub however, we would like your opinion on a few things. 

If you could please take a moment to answer a few questions in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1voUYO7sEkosNR2YUoRdUKiojYuPlnSMGLXHvPI0JJz4/edit) our very own /u/Pick_Me_15 has made, we will be able to get a better idea of how everyone would like to see us handle things going forward.

If you have any additional thoughts, questions, or things you would like to see us do, please feel free to post them in the comments below!

Just my opinion but the intro to the English version was not as good as I expected so I decided to mix the first half of the Korean version to be just like it was at KCON NY.

I'm hoping someone likes this enough to upload to YouTube. I don't speak Korean so I can't make a lyric video and I'd feel bad using someone elses lyric video.",2,1,False,self,,,,,

The result of our community survey are in! I'm here to give you the results and explain the decisions the mod team has made and what the changes will be going forward.

Let's start off with the big questions and content, as well as the changes and then I'll get into demographics/fun facts at the end. I apologize for the long post, there's a lot of information!

---
 [What would you like to see more/less of?](https://i.imgur.com/EoUOsLg.png)

Pretty much across the board there was a positive ask for: Images, GIFs, Videos/Fancams, News, Albums/Song Discussions, Social Media Updates.

The one thing that people seem to not want is Fan Content (Music Covers, Fan Art etc).

---
 [Would you be interested in a weekly free-talk thread?](https://i.imgur.com/uIjHIA4.png)

A pretty resounding yes at 76.8% we've decided that weekly free talk threads will for sure be a thing! This will be a good spot to fill the desire for album discussions above.

---
[How often would you like to see individual member megathreads for GIFs, images and discussion?](https://i.imgur.com/elWVQ8t.png)

This was a close race with only 52.8% saying weekly vs biweekly. We understand there was confusion on the use of biweekly, it was intended to mean every two weeks. For now we'll be starting with weekly member threads and if it ends up being too much, move to biweekly.

---
So what's gonna be new? How are submissions changing?

First things first, I regret to inform you that submissions aren't going to completely open up. But wait! That doesn't mean you can't share your content! There are going to be weekly free talk threads as well as weekly member threads, and that's where we'll get some content concentration.

Weekly free talk threads will be posted every Friday at 12AM CST. This will be the spot to discuss &amp; share anything you please (doesn't have to be Red Velvet related). This is where we hope more of the community gets to know eachother outside of RV. One word of warning though, all discussion is to be kept SFW! Member stuff goes in the member threads.

Weekly member threads will also be posted according to the following schedule:

* Monday - Irene

* Tuesday - Seulgi

* Wednesday - Wendy (seewhatwedidthere?)

* Thursday - Joy

* Friday - Yeri


Member threads are the place to post member images/GIFs/links and talk about members. This should be content that wouldn't appear on the normal feed from approved posters. Fan content can live here!

We're trying to keep the sub a bit of a cut above. While it's OK, dank memery and crack videos have another home that isn't here. I'm sure you can find it and I definitely suggest you check it out!

---
Rules:

As things are going to get more active we're going to need rules to help keep everything together. These are:

* Reddequite

* SFW content only

* No comments sexualizing, objectifying or otherwise demeaning any of the members (or anyone for that matter)

* Speaking ill of other groups/artsists/fandoms is not acceptable

* Disagreement in discussion is ok, however personal attacks/argumentum ad hominem does not contribute and will be removed

* Racism/sexism or any other form of discrimination is strictly forbidden

* Main feed posts are restricted to approved posters only

* Doxxing/posting of personal information (be it phone number, address, personal social media) will result in an immediate ban. Private, unofficial information of the members (like flight info) falls under this as well.

* Any comment or post that is not a direct violation by the letter but is in the spirit of circumventing the rules is considered in violation of the rules

---
Who is /r/red_velvet?

From the survey results [here](https://i.imgur.com/esiRGUP.png) you can see that the vast majority of our users are in the 18-37 age range. Our users under 18 and over 37 are no less important or significant though!

The [bias](https://i.imgur.com/p3Yveu5.png) vote is also in, don't read too much into it! All the members are awesome!

Most users tend to visit the sub on a [daily-weekly](https://i.imgur.com/I1F7FrR.png) basis. Hopefully the new discussion threads can help keep those people entertained, but the sub will stay organized that those few that come by monthly won'y miss out!

---

I look forward to the future and I hope you all do too. Just because these changes are in place now doesn't mean they're permanent, and doesn't mean that they'r the end of changes to this sub. We hope to all grow together and make this a better place for everyone!

Massive thank you to /u/thenerdal for making the place exist, /u/JerSucks and /u/Pick_Me_15 for the hard work they've done and keep doing!

You can definitely expect to see more of us around, /u/Pick_Me_15 will be starting album survivor and I'll be kicking off topics in the discussion threads!

If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to message the mod team!

* Voting will last approximately 48 hours per poll (I'll be posting them every other day due to my schedule).

* You are voting for a track to be ***eliminated***. Do not vote for your favorite.

* In the event of a tie, **both** songs will be eliminated.

* Lobbying for a track is encouraged, downvoting or trolling because someone disagrees is not.

It helped distinguish the new members by associating them with their hair. And really helped considering the ICC they went blond/red and threw everyone off. They've been very consistent by promoting with their colors (especially in PU and RF) and as Yeri didn't participate in the debut we have never gotten debut hair again. They did red-tips for Dumb Dumb clearly as a throwback. Unlike many debut concepts, RV's has stayed consistently present throughout their 4 years. The red and velvet sides, as well as the addition of colors in their concepts and concerts, have made RV what they are. But I digress, my question is: do you think Red Velvet will ever do the tipped hair again so we can finally have an OT5 collection of hair colors?",8,11,False,self,,,,,

133,red_velvet,t5_32s1t,2018-8-18,2018,8,18,7,986pmk,self.red_velvet,Let's have a discussion on Red Velvet's live performances.,https://www.reddit.com/r/red_velvet/comments/986pmk/lets_have_a_discussion_on_red_velvets_live/,differentiation1026,1534545405,"Seriously, just LISTEN to the most recent [Music Bank performance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUZmzP8dWks) Their voices are obviously strained and tired. Wendy is trying her best to carry the group vocally, I'm pretty sure she's the only one who sings ""Power Up!"" (understandable because it's part of the chorus, but still, it's supposed to be all 5 members). This isn't even factoring in the really rough first week of performances. Bad Boy had questionable quality in terms of live performances, but it could be excused due to the slow, RnB nature of the song. This time around, with a more poppy, upbeat song, it's glaringly obvious that there is some serious problems with stage presence and charisma, excluding Wendy and maybe Seulgi. 

I want to have a serious discussion about what the international fandom thinks about these issues. I've seen little to no actual discussion about this topic, atleast in English. If you go to any fancam / live stage of Power Up, translate a couple of the Korean comments. I know many international fans have problems with how Korean fans critique their idols and conduct themselves online, but this time around they (generally) have valid criticisms about Red Velvet's live performances. 

What I mainly want to know from you guys here at /r/Red_Velvet is, 

- What is your opinion on the performances of Power Up thus far in these promotions?

- Are there any stand-out members, bad or good?

- Should we be worried for the future success of Red Velvet? Do you think these live performances will have any real impact on how the group is managed or promoted?

To me, especially now that we have an un-lip-synced performance with Music Bank, it's becoming increasingly obvious that Red Velvet needs a serious break. It's really been a while since the last time they had rest. Between the Redmare concert, #CookieJar, and Bad Boy it seems like they're being seriously overburdened this comeback. I suspect it's in order to recreate the insane commercial success of Red Flavor that they had last year (SotY 2017 btw). It's obvious to pretty much anyone who keeps up with Red Velvet that they are seriously putting in work at SM to promote Power Up / Summer Magic, but to me I wish they put in this effort at a time where the group could be showcasing their very best live performances. 

I'm not a hater. Red Velvet is my bias group, Yeri is my ultimate bias in all of k-pop. I own multiple albums and plan to buy more, even Summer Magic (when I'm not broke). I just want to have a civil conversation about this topic, because I care about both the well-being of Red Velvet and the quality of their live performances.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

Hello Reveluvs! Welcome to the third round of the ***Summer Magic*** Survivor series and Discussion!
For those of you who are new to Survivor  each day, well be voting off a song to be eliminated from the game until were left with just one song, which will be considered the winner!

The song eliminated in [Round Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/red_velvet/comments/97ra9w/red_velvet_survivor_summer_magic_round_two/) was **Hit That Drum** with 31.1% of the votes! This time the next most voted for song was actually a three-way tie so any of those three could potentially be eliminated next round!

Looking through the additional comments it looks like we have a group of people that dislike the re-use of Bad Boy, as well as an individual that always gives the reason ""Its not blue lemonade"".


**RULES:**

* Threads will be posted between 12-5pm GMT (Generally)

* Voting will last approximately 48 hours per poll (I'll be posting them every other day due to my schedule).

* You are voting for a track to be ***eliminated***. Do not vote for your favorite.

* In the event of a tie, **both** songs will be eliminated.

* Lobbying for a track is encouraged, downvoting or trolling because someone disagrees is not.

* You can ONLY vote through the Google Form  votes via the comments will not count!

Welcome to the results of the Red Velvet *Summer Magic* Survivor! Thanks to everyone who got involved with the voting.

Before I reveal the results I'd like to say thanks to everyone that got involved, this has been a huge success and I can't wait to start up the next one! Wasn't really sure how this would go down over here but you've all seemed to enjoy it and album discussion is going quite well, which is all I really wanted :)

By now you've probably realised that there were 3 songs left but this is the results thread so that means we had a double elimination in the [fifth round!](https://www.reddit.com/r/red_velvet/comments/99d0z3/red_velvet_survivor_summer_magic_round_five/) So out of the remaining songs: *Power Up*, *Blue Lemonade* and, *Bad Boy (English Version)*, we are left with out winner which is...

**Power Up!!!**

Both Bad Boy (English Version) and Blue Lemonade received 37.7% of the vote leaving Power Up as the winner!!

**PREVIOUSLY ELIMINATED**

* Round One - *With You*

* Round Two - *Hit That Drum*

* Round Three - *Mosquito*

* Round Four - *Mr E*

* Runner-Up - *Blue Lemonade* and *Bad Boy (English Version)*

* **Winner - Power Up**

I'd like to thanks one more time to everyone that got involved, it has been a lot of fun! I'm probably going to make survivors for each album now, maybe once a month, so look out for the start of the next one!

I have nothing against Yeri but why did they feel the need to add her to Red Velvet? Sure they weren't quite that established as a group when she joined them, but wouldn't they have worked just as fine with four? Sure, choreography-wise you can do more with an uneven amount of members but other than that?

I love Red Velvet and they're only going further up. I was just wondering.
