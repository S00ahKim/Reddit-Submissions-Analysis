Theyre a girl group that SM Entertainment confidently released in 2014. Having debuted on August 1st, they just got the title of rookie group. Lets start finding out about Red Velvet who is releasing colorful energy with their debut song Happiness.

**What Do I Think Happiness Is**

&gt; ***Irene*** - When I can be with people I can call my own.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi*** - Being with people I like.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Wendy*** - Enjoying things. Not getting stressed about anything, if you do fun things with joy, I believe that is happiness. Thats why I always try to keep a positive mind
&gt; 
&gt; ***Joy*** - Whether you have or dont have people you can do happy things with ( happiness becomes intensified as you share it with more people)

**My Happiest Memory**

&gt; ***Irene*** - When all four of my family members eat at the same table.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi*** - When Im on vacation with my family and get to eat anything I want
&gt; 
&gt; ***Wendy*** - The fact that I recently had my debut stage with my members along with so many fans. That made me very happy as well as touched.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Joy*** - I was the happiest last week at our Music Bank debut stage when I prayed while holding onto my unnies hands. Although I became nervous when all my memories as a trainee passed by as well as the fact that I was debuting, it was also my happiest moment.

**What I Will Show as Red Velvet, Accomplish as Red Velvet**

&gt; ***Irene*** - Showing off a good energy as well as colorful and diverse versions of ourselves just like our name.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi*** - Instead of looking like were stuck trying to show different images of ourselves, I want to become a group where we get approved as a group that can pull off diverse concepts.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Wendy*** - There are so many things I want to show as Red Velvet, but I want to become a group that continues to develop, get love and get our names widespread like our SM seniors
&gt; 
&gt; ***Joy*** - I want to show myself exactly like I am.

**Red Velvet to Me is**

&gt; ***Irene*** - LOVE
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi*** - Late night snacks (keep thinking of it)
&gt; 
&gt; ***Wendy*** - Precious. Here with me the whole way like family. It helped me achieve my long time dream of becoming a singer as well as making me the Wendy I am today.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Joy*** - Refuge ( a place you can trust and lean on )

**If I Were to Describe Myself**

&gt; ***Irene*** - Baby-faced leader, Irene
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi*** - A teddy bear with no double eyelids, Seulgi
&gt; 
&gt; ***Wendy*** - More charming by the day

&gt; 
&gt; Despite it being such a short time, thank you for the overflowing love and attention..bb
&gt; 
&gt; I dont know if I deserve all this love..
&gt; 
&gt; August 1st, Red Velvets first debut stage I will never forget!

&gt; I was so nervous that I couldnt sleep, but I think was really really happy to see so many people come see us than I expected!!! Thank you once again~!
&gt; 
&gt; I dont know I happy I am to be able to fulfill my long time dream of a singer with my members along with all of you guys  3
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Did you guys eat the red velvet donuts that we all genuinely put the logos on? &gt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, to all the fans that cheer Red Velvet on that we couldnt meet yesterday!! Thank you so so much!!

**Happiness~ Hello, its Joy.**

&gt; It was the first time meeting our fans in a closer way than just from the stage.
&gt; 
&gt; You dont know how nervous and happy I was when I heard we were having a fan meeting
&gt; 
&gt; I was really touched to see so many people showing up despite the rain.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone!! Did you eat the red velvet donuts well? 
&gt; 
&gt; Its such a small present compared to the love we are receiving but
&gt; 
&gt; I wish you guys would enjoy it while thinking of Red Velvet
&gt; 
&gt; Ill become a Joy that cheers up and delivers happiness
&gt; 
&gt; Please love Red Velvet a lot
&gt; 
&gt; Red Velvet fans are the best~~~~!

&gt; ***Q***: In the music world filled with idols armed in strong and sexy concepts, Red Velvet chose to be natural instead. You give bright performances and positive energy fitting with your age with your song. What's your difference between girl groups who acts sexily?
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi***: It's good to be pretty but we thought that we should go with fresh, and bright image. Our song has African mood and beat and is of urban Europop genre so sexy and fierce concept doesn't fit it. We're happy because people see us cutely.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Q***: Looking at Irene, she's smiling brightly during Happiness music video. Knowing someone like this, they're often the funniest ones.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi***: That's right. If you'll notice it more, she's the funniest. After we finished filming, we were going for radio recording and in fact, we practiced among us. That time, Irene unnie pretended to be Kim Chang Ryul sunbae. She's so good. Haha.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Q***: I was wondering if SM Entertainment can produce a unique girlgroup which is not like SNSD or f(x) and Red Velvet is the answer to this which I never imagined. 
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi***: We had a burden in that part. We worried about ""What kind of performance should we show off"" more rather than worrying about ""Which side of us should we show to people"" even until now. After the long worry, we were just surprised and overwhelmed that a lot of fans supported us after seeing our performances and the song.

**Irene and Seulgi's Interview**

&gt; ***Q***: You were able to endure and stand for your first performance an hour ago. You must be thrilled.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Seulgi***: Our debut stage was on Music Bank. We turned and started to do our choreography then fans chanted ""Red Velvet, congratulations on your debut!"" That time we thought, ""So we're really standing on stage now""
&gt; 
&gt; ***Irene***: When we passed the audition, we were so happy. We were as happy as that when we stood on our first stage. That time, we walked on our way to be singers and now, we're really starting as singers already.

**Wendy and Joy's Interview**

&gt; ***Q***: Your song consistently says find a way to be happy. How does Red Velvet find happiness?
&gt; 
&gt; ***Joy***: I find happiness through eating. I'm happy whenever i'm eating something with the members. I don't care if it's bread, meat, noodles or whatever kind of food.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Q***: Ey, you find happiness only through that? Isn't that a typical lie that groups say?
&gt; 
&gt; ***Wendy***: It's true. Diet is our assignment for lifetime. We can't eat as much as we want to so we become happy whenever we eat. We think we can't eat so our attachment (to food) is stronger.

We're very satisfied as rookies. No, I think we're more thankful than satisfied (laughs).

**Joy**: It hasn't been long since we debuted but people are giving us so much love. When I heard about our ranks on music sites, it was so unexpected that I didn't believe it. We have to work hard with a thankful heart. 

**Red Velvet**: We're a girl team which game out 5 years later so we think that is why people give us a lot of attention. Plus our seniors are popular and good so that's also an impact. We're just thankful. It's impossible that we won't feel any pressure as SM rookies but we have our own different colour so we believe that we will do well. 

**Wendy &amp; Seulgi**: It was out first time to see BoA's sunbae's stage for real. We figured out why she was entitled ""Asia's star"". Her charisma on stage was really amazing. She was so cool. Her performance was free and perfect. 

**Wendy, Irene, Seulgi**: We met CEO Lee Sooman at SM Town concert venue and he told us, ""You guys are doing well so work hard"". We're thankful because he cheered us up. Before we debuted, he advised us to ""Just enjoy your stage"". He also told us that the most important moment is now. 

**Red Velvet**: We dreamt to be singers as we watch other people too. We also want to be someone's dream. We want to be artists like the seniors in our company who introduces K-pop to people and artists who get to influence the whole world. We are also aiming to be singers who gives bright and good energy to people (laughs).

**Wendy, Irene, Seulgi**: We met CEO Lee Sooman at SM Town concert venue and he told us, ""You guys are doing well so work hard"". We're thankful because he cheered us up. Before we debuted, he advised us to ""Just enjoy your stage"". He also told us that the most important moment is now. 

**Red Velvet**: We dreamt to be singers as we watch other people too. We also want to be someone's dream. We want to be artists like the seniors in our company who introduces K-pop to people and artists who get to influence the whole world. We are also aiming to be singers who gives bright and good energy to people (laughs).

###140829 Interview for Newsen 

Many people said we look like puppies. Haha. Of course on the first day we got our hair did it was it felt really weird and we couldnt get used to it. We thought can we actually debut with our hair like this can we get our fans to like us when our hairs look so weird. Back then the colours were even more brighter and bolder than this. But looking back, now we think that they recognize us more and can tell us apart just by looking at our hair colours and we were able to get more attention for this.

I still cant believe that we have debuted. We are so grateful and happy for all the love and support we are getting. We are already looking forward to our next comeback. I think well have fun.

""Rather than describing it as anticipation, I think It was good for me because during the 7 years of preparation, I learnt a lot more and could prepare myself to be better. Of course there was a slump but I think I become stronger in mentally while going through this. (SEULGI)

To be honest I will be a lie if I said that there was no pressure. But we try not to care because we have our own colours. Instead of worrying about that, we tried to find our own colours because we thought the more we think about that we will be constantly worried about that. (WENDY)

""Freshness and that we are quite small. If you see celebrities these days they are all tall and have nice bodies but I think we can look more realistic and agreeable in a way.

Because there is the colour red in our team name, we do have a hidden sexiness. We showed freshness and the smooth side of us this time, so hopefully next time we can show you our red side next time.(SEULGI)

###Seulgi talks about their fans &amp; Wendy explained why they were holding hands while heading to music broadcast 

**Seulgi**: During our debut stage, a lot of fans came. We thought they were fans of other idol groups but they were ours. We were shocked and amazed. 

There were also a lot of fans while Red Velvet were heading to music broadcast taking pictures and when asked why they were holding hands back then, Wendy explained: ""We were very nervous and we don't know what we should do so we walked while holding hands. We like holding hands. It makes us feel at ease.""

###Wendy talks about her dad 

**Wendy**: My dad knows that I like to sing so he bought a microphone for me. When I sing loudly, he asks me to keep quiet so I go inside the closet and record my voice while singing. My friend uploaded my friend upload my first video and comments were coming through so I kept on recording.

###Wendy talks about her name being mistaken as ""Seunghwan"" &amp; Irene &amp;Joy are still awkward with their stage name 

Three members Irene (Bae Juhyeon), Wendy (Son Seungwan) and Joy (Park Sooyoung) are using stage names. Wendy whose name was mistaken as Son Seunghwan said ""It came out that my name was Son Seunghwan so I wanted to reply each of the comments that the correct name is Son Seungwan. I think I received more attention because it's a guy's name."" 

Joy and Irene spitted out that they're still awkward with their stage names. 

**Irene**: When they first called me Irene, I thought it wasn't my name. If you'll see Henry's sunbae's '1-4-3' music video, the name Irene appeared. I thought it was just in the play but they said it's my name.

###Joy wanted to be a teacher but explains why she ended up as a singer 

**Joy**: It hasn't been long since I dreamt to be a singer. I'm the eldest daughter so I wanted to study hard and my dream was to be a teacher. I stood up on stage once during our school trip and I sang Cherryfilter's 'Flying duck'. The moment that I sang a verse of the song and heard the cheer of the audience, I knew the taste of the stage. Since then, I thought that rather than studying, I want to go to music. I'm the eldest so I can't tell my parents, so I asked my friends how about I try to audition. My parents didn't expect it, but SM GLOBAL audition became my first audition that I tried.

###140831 Red Velvet reveals the SM trainee life. It is difficult to communicate with seniors.

SM's new girl group Red Velvet is revealed 5 years after their last [girl group]. Their debut song is titled Happiness and has been spreading the happy virus to people. Starting from the left is Wendy, Seulgi, Irene, and Joy. Photo credit to = SM Entertainment
SM Entertainment is one of the most popular entertainment companies amongst countless numbers of trainees who are preparing to become Kpop idols. With singers from all time-periods/ generations starting from H.O.T, to S.E.S, Shinhwa, TVXQ, Super Junior, Girls' Generation, f(x), SHINee, and EXO. Therefore, being a trainee at SM Entertainment would definitely make one proud of them self. But how confident would one feel after debuting under SM?

Actually, there is a new girl group that has debuted under SM Entertainment that would most definitely leave other SM trainees in envy. [The group] consists of Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, and Joy whom make up the group, Red Velvet. It seems as though the girls had no problem with their debut, but on the contrary to what we may all think, they spoke about the name 'SM' giving them a lot of pressure. We knew that people had high expectations for us because of the fact that we are SMs newest girl group debuting five years since the last [girl group]. Since we were nervous about the fact that we might not be able to fulfil [people's] expectations, we worried that we wouldn't be able to show our charms on stage properly. [NOTE: They're talking about the fact that since they are an SM girl group, people would have high expectations of them because SM is such a powerful managing company. Because of their nervousness, they were scared that they wouldn't be able to perform properly.]

When Red Velvet was feeling anxious about their debut, SM's main directer (founder) Lee Sooman gave them words of encouragement. [Their] leader Irene explained, Teacher Lee told us to enjoy the stage as much as possible. Since we are rookies, and being a newbie is one of the most important times in a singer's lifetime, teacher advised us to be confident and proud on stage. This is why we try to be positive every time we go on stage.

What secret does SM Entertainment use to produce perfect K-pop idols? To the question, Red Velvet answered, One of the best parts of SM is that the entertainment company makes trainees practice systematically [according to their skills]. The system also allows trainees to improve on their strengths and give trainees time and help to develop themselves [as artists].
It is not true that all SM trainees have their expected debut date. Red Velvet's Seulgi has been training for seven years- since [the] seventh grade, and Irene had five years of training. However, Wendy and Joy had shorter training periods compared to Seulgi and Irene; [both trained for] 2 years.

Being a SM artist, it comes as an expectation that they will meet and talk with seniors at SM who are already top stars. But to tell you the truth, this is false. Red Velvet members said, We met [our] seniors a few times while going back and forth for training, but it was hard to meet top singers personally or officially even if we were from the same company as them. We met [our] seniors officially for the first time at the 'SMTOWN' concert last month.

Red Velvets debut song titled Happiness is an urban European pop song. It contains positive lyrics that talk about happiness that one can find easily in their life, [as a result in teaching] one to love them self more.
Happiness is one of the best songs to show people the energy and freshness of just-debuted newbie idols. [The] Red Velvet member's smiles and bubbly choreography on the stage give an odd charm that causes for others to enjoy their stage as well. The choreography of Happiness was by a Japanese choreographer by the name of Takeuchi Ayako, who has previously worked with BoA and Girls' Generation. SMs performance director Jaewon Shim also contributed to the dance, making a complete, perfect choreography.

Red Velvet member said, When we first heard Happiness, the song only consisted of the melody; no lyrics. [The] African beat rhythm was awkward, but soon we came to realize that the song was really catchy. They then added, We guess that our debut was successful, seeing as though many people are enjoying our stages. Since we have many supportive fans, we are trying our best on stage to have more powerful and eye-catching performances.

Believe it or not, Red Velvet is a popular girl group even outside of Korea. After the release of Happiness, the song appeared in the top 10's of iTune's single chart in [countries such as] Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Hong Kong.

After [their] official debut, the interest in [the] individual members increased immensely. People's interests especially revolved around the member's unique hair colors which allowed people to easily seek differences between [the] members.
Irene, whose hair color is pink, has white skin and cute baby face; [and] Seulgi with orange coloured hair is what you would call an Asian beauty. Wendy, who has [a] charming smile, chose blue. And [the] youngest of all [members], Joy, chose green making her appear more adorable.

Red Velvet said, [Our] members chose their hair colors judging by their personalities. Since we have unique hair colors, the difference between each member is easily visible even from far away. However, the colors become faded easily so we have to dye our hair quite often.
It was visibly shown that Red Velvet's debut was a success. But on the contrary, the Red Velvet member's said, ""Even though we had a successful debut, we have a lot more to show our fans. We're really excited as to the point where we get tingles when we think about how we're going to change in the future. And to add to that, please expect other unique, adorable, and charming stages.
