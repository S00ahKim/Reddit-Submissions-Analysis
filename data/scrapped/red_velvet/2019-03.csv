I know they had that short video of each venue and how many Km of travel and flight time but I haven't seen anything attendance wise. I'd love to know the actual numbers or at least close to what each venue had. I know that the Toronto show had somewhere in the 3000s but this was the day of the ticket sales, they eventually opened up the venue more for more seats. On a side note as well, I'd love to see RV play in a bigger venue for more fans to enjoy but at the same time being in a small venue with no bad seats and an intimate setting was such a memorable experience that I wouldn't want it any other way!",5,22

10,2019-3-3,2019,3,3,1,awj8hi,Why is Red Velvet not more popular?,haruhisuzu,1551543178,"This is just a question I've been wondering about since I became a can in mid 2017. They're a whole package: singing, rapping, music, dancing, personalities, etc. 


Is it because they received a lot of hate from debut? There was a lot of controversy with Happiness, including the MV and how quickly they debuted (from what I know, SM announced a new girlgroup a week before their debut??). Happiness was a moderate success imo but Be Natural was a flop and probably pushed away potential fans with their new sound/dual concept. If we compare RV to Twice and BP, only they had small hype and interest from debut.

They did really well with ICC and DD and then SM somewhat killed their red-side momentum with OOTN. The digitals were poor but the sales were okay but a downgrade from The Red. They do really well with Red songs so this most likely pushed away potential fans once again whereas Twice and BP's titletracks have similar sounds/concepts while RV tries new stuff with each comeback. 


Russian Roulette was a major success and their titletracks from RR to Power Up were all hits and solidied their position as part of top 3 girlgroups however, their album sales and MV views haven't improved that much. Yes, they hit 100k with Rookie and have been consistent with hitting 100k for each comeback since however, there havent been any huge improvements in album sales despite RV becoming more popular in the kpop community and worldwide. I know that Summer Magic had huge sales reaching 150k. I was on OneHallyu looking at the sales weekly and it looked like it got huge numbers because of the limited editions and would've reached more if SM didn't print a small amount (a lot of Kfans buy the limited editions in stores). So we can see that their sales is most likely because of SM's poor packaging and if SM wants RV to gain more numbers they need to stop with the jewel cases and put more effort into their albums. 

As for MV views, if we look at 2018 comebacks, Bad Boy is about to reach 200M while PU and RBB are below 100M. Compare this to Twice and BP with their MVs reaching 100M very quickly often in a month or two. SM groups lack MV views in general but when you have a new girlgroup hitting 50M views in 48hrs compared to RBB who just reached 30M last month it's confusing. Of course, MV views don't mean anything but it's important in today where having high views can win music shows and the fandom don't put much effort into streaming imo. It's fine if you dont stream constantly I do the same but there are a lot of people in this fandom who thinks streaming is not useful at all and big accounts with 10k-30k followers on twitter/IG tend to push this mentality which is disappointing. I dont expect record-breaking views but RBB being at 30M is kind of embarrassing. 


It's just weird imo that while RV has become huge in Korea and worldwide that their fandom havent increased much. I've seen some say that RV attracts more causal fans than loyal fans which is disappointing. The numbers from concert attendees and album sales which hasn't improved drastically despite their explosion in 2017. However, it's arguable that these are SM's fault where they dont trust RV enough to give them bigger avenues (especially in Korea which is extremely ridiculous since they can easily perform in 20k-40k venues if they can perform in 17k venues in Japan). And as for album sales, I've already explained above. 


Their duality concept prevents them from being a THE top girlgroup since Korea likes consistency and it's expected that they wont do as well as soon they'll start focusing on solo activities but with no new SM girlgroup I hope we can work together and give them their most successful comeback to date this summer! Unlikely but I hope they win SOTY someday. 


This is just my theories and I'm fine with RV not being the nation's girlgroup or something but I love RV very much so I cant help but wonder why they aren't popular. Feel free to correct me on anything and I'd love to hear your thought. There's not much activity or discussion here compared to BP and Twice's subreddits  (Sorry for comparing so much with BP and Twice, it's just that those 3 are considered to be the 3rd gen's top 3 girlgroups hope Im not upsetting anyone with this)


P.S. random but SM is sending NCT to Europe hopefully Redmare tour isnt over amd the girls come here too",15,18

What do you hope for RV in 2019 in terms of group activities and solo activities too. I hope Avex gives the girls proper promotions for their jpn songs since I believe they have potential to get bigger imo. I also want a 3rd full album this year since SM always give the highest quality of music in their full albums
 

Solo activities, I'm gonna be biased and focus on my bias Seulgi :P I hope she gets more opportunities as a singer. So hopefully more collabs (I hope one with Sunmi) and she mentioned wanting to focus more on dancing this year in an interview so I hope SM gives her the opportunities to do so. ",17,26

record I want to improve it. I need to do something against the glare of the lights in the video, improve fps, and increase the quality to maybe 4k. So I'm wondering if any other fans are using a video editor, I'd appreciate it. I wanna

enjoy the memories in crisp 60 (possibly 120) fps with high res lol

I don't know if this is unpopular or not but I was really disappointed with RBB's concept. The styling was awful and I know the MV is meant to be a mimic of B-horror movies but it looked SO cheap and after how cheap BB and PU MVs were I was even more disappointed. Plus the whole name being a sequel to BB and then making a song completely different.. Would've been better if SM chose a different name for the titletrack.

Anyway, I hope we get a darker version of Dumb Dumb since that's my favorite era aesthetically and also a proper hiphop song with strong choreography. ",41,38
