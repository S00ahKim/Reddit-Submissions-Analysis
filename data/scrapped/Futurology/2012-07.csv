Currently a jump between one to another requires a reprocessing and translation of media. A spoken phrase requires a separate set of skills and tools to convert to a written phrase and yet another set of skills or tools for a visual translation.

Speech to text technology has automated the translation process for two of these languages but the form they take in order for us to digest each of them is still unique from one another. Image recognition is also developing strong but the converted results are a bit more nebulous as a description. 

Take for instance information recorded as written language how will our wired minds, catalog, search, interact and use this form of information? Will our brains need to somehow ""read"" the text and then translate it's meaning? or is written language too far removed from thought process and will this written data at some point be auto converted into ""thought"" for us?

I've always been fascinated with the design structures that will be necessary in organizing this type of data flow.

What could the cataloging of something like a memory look like? I have had my thoughts, but am curious as to what you may think. How will one persons visual memory ""appear"" to another person in a search? If it had to take a form what could the structure for this type of information look like in the minds eye? How do you visualize your own thoughts. Are your memories grouped or organized in a way that can be described to me?


Edit:  if necessary, take some time to consider this before answering, but, please post a quick note letting me know you are processing. Thanks.",1,5,False,self,,,,,

I've found one company that is currently researching spider-silk in applications: [Kraig Biocraft Laboratories.](http://www.kraiglabs.com/) It's stock symbol is KBLB, but I have a few problems with this (I'll x-post to /r/investing, but I wanted a /r/futurology take on it as well):

* KBLB is a penny stock, which means it can be risky and subject to 'pump &amp; dump' scams. Although getting in early may be extremely beneficial.

* Are there any other companies that are spending money on R&amp;D into spider-silk production? If no, why not?

* What are the best companies for future materials? Is it 3M? BASF?

* I'm not sure about practical applications. It seems like if spider-silk could be manufactured cheaper than Kevlar it could be viable, especially since it'll (likely) decrease the weight compared with current Kevlar applications.

* Are there better innovations occurring on Kevlar that will trump any biologic based 'spider-silk' materials?

So what do you think? Will Spider-silk be a future material that will make lite-weight clothing that is also bullet-proof, or is this just another Beta-max, good for somethings but eclipsed in the market by other, more viable products?

The manifesto in the side bar here is quite a good read, but it seems that at its core, this is essentially Transhumanism. It seems to me Transhumanism is a little more intense (read: we are almost already all cyborgs), whereas Futurology seems to have more respect for preserving humanity somehow. Or perhaps Futurology is about the study of the Future, and Transhumanism is a subset? A rather big one?

I propose we create a list with all of the best books related to, and about, Futurology. To begin, the list will be split into Fiction and Non-Fiction sections. If users feel that there are other more interesting ways to break the list down then PM me with your proposal. 

If you want me to add something to the list just comment on this post with the Title and Author and I will add it. However, if the community decides, through voting, that a recommendation is not worthy of this list I will remove it. To clarify; all recommendations will be automatically added to the reading list and it is the Futurology community's responsibility to decide if a new inclusion stays or goes. Vote responsibly :)

I've spoken with Xenophon and he has agreed to put this list on the sidebar once it gets going.

Finally, everything I've said is subject to change. We're a community and as such I'm not interested in being the List Dictator (TM). If you don't like something, or think we can do it better, let me know.

I'm working on one about nanotechnology right now and was wondering if you guys had any comments, suggestions or criticisms. Any other things I should mention? Is the gray goo scenario too dark for little kids? Is the subject matter too difficult or explained in a confusing way? 

Futurology for Kids:
Nanotechnology


Most of us know what technology is. Technology is what we call the tools people make and use every day to make our lives better. Things like computers, cell phones, and TVs. But what is nanotechnology?


Nano means very, very small. So nanotechnology is really tiny technology. We already have computers that fit in our hands, and scientists work hard every day to make machines smaller and smaller. Someday in the future, we'll have machines smaller than we can see without a microscope. 



There are lots of things we could do with such tiny machines. We could put them in a shot and have the little robots take medicine to the parts of the body that need it the most.



We could have a whole bunch of them hook together like building blocks and make bigger things like a toy car. When you are done playing with the car, they could fit together in a different way to make something else. Anything you can imagine could be made from these tiny computers.


Tiny robots could be taught how to build copies of themselves. More and more robots would be built until they were everywhere. They would all be connected to the Internet and would always be talking to each other. When that happens, anyone could connect to the Internet and see what the robots were seeing and know what they know. 
 

But what if the robots didn't stop making copies of themselves? They could turn the entire world into a giant ball of gray goo made of tiny machines. 

We probably don't have to worry about that, though, since scientists would make sure to program them so that they stop making copies when there are enough of them.  ",0,1,False,default,,,,,

1. Through the growth of the BRIC nations, there's an explosion of college degrees leading to huge amount of available research and development power. Scattered around the world, not only their whole number but also the variance of backgrounds will increase the overall problem solving capability. India and China produce already ingenious minds.

2. The rising of interactive learning systems with the capabilities to find blind spots, to diffuse curricula etc. are greatly increasing the efficiency of the educational system in a few years. It's now possible to learn more in the same amount of time than ever, making it possible to get more intelligence between subjects. Efficacy increases a lot too, since your class reaches virtually everywhere and the need to filtering students decreases because the one-lecture for all approach vanishes.

3. New computing power:
Although we're facing the end of silicon computation, new generations of computer chips are on the rise. One can already buy quantum computers exploring new kind of algorithm complexities. Parallelization makes it possible to increase conventional computing power for at least a decade still following moore's law. Combined this with chip- or programbased neural networks, which apparently only need to get bigger, a virtual brain is in range of sight for the next 3 decades but not only evolutionary/statisticall A.I. is making huge progress, but formal A.I is making big steps too. Many people use already evolutionary algorithms to do their research.

4. the end of semi-hierarchical systems in intelligence:
The overall patent system and publishing system won't scale to this explosion of research and development. Regarding how bad the patent system already works or doesn't work, it's just a matter of time when it's not used anymore. Although the paper publishing in science has different goals compared to the patent system, it works very similarly and thus it won't scale for much longer. 

5. The rise of scalable intelligence structures:
Linux kernel development pretty much shows how collaboration on a huge scale is possible and increases efficiancy on intelligence work. It has huge advantages compared to the old peer-review system. Just for an example: Linux kernel development makes lower education work accessible to  lower educated people which would have been done by highly educated people wasting their worktime. Programs like git or bitkeeper will be the base of every scientific theory.

(6.) Akkumulation of Data and Data analysation tools

That's what i think is going to happen to universities and brain intelligence companies in the next decades. I have proof for all my claims or detailed explanations.

I am a technology and marketing enthusiast, enjoy forward thinking, science, and have attended conferences about transhumanism.

According to the sidebar, this subreddit is a 
&gt;subreddit devoted to speculation about the future through discussions, images, videos, art, gifs, and tedtalks about technology, civilization, foresight, futurology, futurism, the Singularity, Transhumanism and accelerating change. The future is infinite.

This, to me, is a beautiful, optimistic and utopian idea of the subreddit. However, as r/Futurology grows, we may run in to some problems. As any subscriber to r/truereddit, or anyone who has been on reddit for more than 4 years, Reddit slowly moves toward lower quality posts. It's almost as though we are acting following entropy, and when a subreddit reaches a certain number of subscribers, the subreddit has a heat death of very low level submissions and comments.

How can we keep a subreddit away from this heat death? I can think of a few ideas, but I would love to discuss everything!

* Rules. Strong, easy to understand rules where everyone knows instantly if a rule was broken. An easy example of this rule is at r/ggggg. Everyone knows what should be submitted, and everyone follows the rules. Instant ban/delete for offenders. The rules for this sub should be very specific and published loudly in the sidebar and maybe at the top. They should be more than ""be civil"". Maybe it should be guidance about what the post title has (should say specific idea source or concept).
* Moderation. Make sure everything is right and correct. We have the team in place, we just need to make sure everyone is on the same page with rules to allow/disallow certain posts. Everyone thinks of r/askscience when it comes to moderation, and even though askscience is VERY cut and dry and easy to evaluate, it is still a great example.
* Self posts. They fix a lot of issues. Link, then a quick information blurb about it, instead of minions posting things for karma.

Enlightenment after Enlightenment, idea after idea - everything from the number zero to silicone microprocessors has revolutionized the world in a radical way, often with results no one could have guessed towards.

I think crowd-sourcing and open source is going to be the next major 'game changer' for the world.  The cost savings of using open source combined with the wisdom of the crowd allows a unique level of efficiency within the movement - the occupy movement boycot banks and companies, sometimes actually making a difference - but did they realise if instead of boycotting bad companies they supported good one that they'll be making a much large difference? when you buy from an open source supporting company you're paying the wages of someone who'll likely use those wages to buy more open source, you're allowing that person to create more open source products, and you're getting whatever it is that you've brought. You might say that this only works for hardware, and if you think about it the old fashioned way then sure i agree, hardware companies like makerbot can sell kits and working items to fund development, but what can open source coders sell? well exactly what they would to a company that might employ them to do proprietary software, their time and skills. For a small donation we can 'buy' their time and their skills, we can 'order' a few hours from their 'shop' and 'pay' them to work on improving something - rather than wait for someone to make a program with a drag and drop interface we can pay someone to take time off their other job and code a drag and drop interface, here not only do we get what we want but we give that ability to the whole world and we invite others to improve and continue the tools we've helped provide. 
  
I think that once groups like occupy and even greenpeace or any of the various special interest groups realize that by helping the development of open tools they can enable people all over the globe to be better able to support their cause then we'll see the focus and effectiveness of change based organisations develop rapidly.  Gandhi had a point of spinning his own clothes, the reason for this was because homespun cloth supported the local community rather than the invading and occupying forces, he broke the sale embargo and manufactured his own salt for similar reasons - when you're self-sufficient people can't control you, this is bound to be a big draw to groups who complain about oppression and tyranny; but further if groups like greenpeace can enable their supporters to collect data, to perform positive actions or etc AND resist the corporate bullshit, isn't that even more likely to appeal?  Instead of greenpeace simply having to tell people to complain about what other people are doing wrong they can help put them out of business by enabling others to do it right.   
  
Personally i think we're already moving into another stage of development, the industrial revolution which started with the steam era is finally starting to draw to a rumbling close, during the fifties many people worried that at some coming point the production abilities of the factories would exceed peoples need; they'd have their toothbrush and shaving kit, their bed and duvet, their TV and radio, they wouldn't need anything else and so everything would stagnate, or more likely as the system depends on growth - it would collapse. But then along came Consumerism and the endless desire for self-expression and novelty - some say we're manipulated into being thus but i believe we're simply more clever at addressing the world, more able to ask better questions and so from this higher position we have higher expectations. Soon, i hope, we will pass from this mania like stage of compulsive purchasing and move into a more sedate post-industrial age, here we'll have a more considered approach to life; neither obsessed by poverty or opulence - in this future world one may satiate the desire for basic necessities and still lust after inventiveness yet neither of these things are what drives and focuses desires and actions. I'd like to see a world where people realize that instead of needing to demonstrate their wealth via ostentatious trainers or name-tagged-watches they can actually improve their life experience and the quality of the world simply by diverting some funds into projects which they support and believe in.

In a lot of ways it's a culminations of capitalistic and libertarian free market theories and the communistic or socialist principles of the 'rising tide' - projects survive and grow via a process of natural selection of the most fit to impress someones altruistic and pragmatic understandings and desires. When the community wants autonomous gardening robots the community acts to enable autonomous gardening robots, being aware of your desires, considering them rationally and acting to attain them is an important stage of growing up, one which maybe the world as a whole is starting to learn.",4,7,False,self,,,,,

Science and society have been structured on the ability to recognize individuals and categorize them for efficiency and productivity. Many lifetimes have been invested into deciphering this natural construct and understanding its biological code.

Manmade enhancements of our communication, interaction, body and selves will not be created to ignore the natural distinctions of self. Too much has been structured on these premises. Instead the technology within our society will inevitably be bent to meet up with the drawn path of the current social course. The refinement of tech that allows for restriction to be toggled on and off depending on regional law is proof of this bend toward current social order with an incremental evolution.

Individuals will need to float within the network. To do this the network will come to the individual in the form of various manmade devices placed within our natural environment. If access is to be a seemingly natural occurrence, it will come from the natural distinctions of our current physical selves. The algorithms of Face, of Body, of Fingers, and Voice, will be the keys as they pass through the keyholes of lenses, touch pads, and microphones. For now it is that simple. You as you exist right now will be recognized by your environment. Visions beyond this leap of human evolution is merely the the promise of a flying car and a jet pack. This is our generational shift so think within this parameter. Keep in mind however, this on a global scale.

To make this jump the transition can and has been mapped. Like all designed societies a philosophy of reason will be a carrot. Regardless of the map that lies ahead, the incremental steps have been followed as built, they have been presented and we have been enticed incrementally.

My predictions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xaazn/what_if_solar_power_were_suddenly_110th_the_price/,etherop,1343450714,"Thinking about both photovoltaic and thermal with storage.  Both would provide more power in the summer than winter, except around the equator where they provide more constant power year round.  [Solar insolation map](http://www.geosolution.com/solar_map.htm).

I looked around for an analysis like this but couldn't find anything online.  I suppose a lot of sci fi makes the assumption of cheap power, but I don't think it's usually a primary focus.

Here are my predictions:

- Electric heat will become competitive with natural gas, especially seasonal storage heating, which can store heat from the summer for use in the winter.
- We will switch to electric vehicles.  There will be more charging stations, since these are a very small investment compared to a gas station (no huge tank of gas).  More power stations mean you need a smaller battery, and since [1/4-1/2 of the vehicle cost is the battery](http://miter.mit.edu/article/cost-dilemma-why-are-batteries-so-expensive), this drops the price of the vehicle significantly.
- Coal will become cheaper.
- Oil will become cheaper gradually as cars switch to electricity.  Oil companies will fight technology but will fail.
- [HVDC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current) lines will encourage electricity transport between north-south neighbors, creating a dependence.  Africa and Europe are [already planning it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertec).
- Desalination, a power-hungry process, will make fresh water and power available in previously uninhabitable deserts near oceans.  
- New communities will form due to fresh water, and tensions about water will ease.  This will be most significant in the middle east, which will again find itself rich in natural resources - though not as exportable.
- Large scale solar plants will affect the weather: PV may convert 10-20% of the sun energy to electricity.  Solar thermal will convert perhaps up to 70% to heat, which will be released as electricity is generated with heat engines.  It would stabilize the day-night temperature in the deserts.  (Current conversion levels are low (like 3-5%) due to spacing out of mirrors/pv cells, but as the tech gets cheaper, I believe the collection elements will be closer together to increase peak collection and the plants will be much larger)
- Cheap hydrogen will be available (2030 they say), using the [sulfur iodine cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur%E2%80%93iodine_cycle), which makes use of high temperatures (1000c) obtainable from solar thermal ([~1500c is efficient using 5000x concentration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power#Efficiency) and is well below the theoretical limit for earth of 45000x).
- DC power will be cheaper around PV fields during the day, due to the cost of inverters.  This can be used, for instance, to power lasers and computers.  But this will only be available when it's sunny.
- Societal effect: electricity will be guilt-free (including driving).  The transition to renewables will have been a success.
- Environmentalists may eventually protest *against* solar power, saying it's taking up too much land.

That's all I have.  I think solar will be our next source of power.  It already powers our hydroelectric and wind, and created our coal and oil.  Perhaps fusion or fission will become bigger in the future, but I think solar will be the nearer future.",11,28,False,self,,,,,

Computers already outperform the average human. The two components that make computers function are electricity and human interaction. 

We have reached some sort of a plateau. Once we can overcome the necessity of human interaction we shall have reached the singularity.

The question then becomes: Can computers be made to think like humans? Theoretically it should be possible. Should I be asking a better question?

How about: *Should* computers be made to think like humans? A computer is definitely not a human. At this time it may be a bit unrealistic to expect computers to function on a human level. When a hawk is taught to kill a target (as in falconry) you don't teach it to aim a rifle and pull the trigger. The hawk has special characteristics that are unique to it's design. It is unrealistic to teach an animal to hunt like a human.

There is one exception to this: Design tools that allow computers to act like humans. This entails giving a computer humanly features. However even at perfection this does not allow a computer to think like a human, so we must return to the last two questions: Can and should computers be made to think like humans?

First off, what makes us human? Is someone without the fear of death truly human? If we don't have the ability to empathize, socialize, relate, have fun, laugh, or feel any emotion, are we human at all?

I argue not. The complexity of the situation is grand. Creating a computer that can figure out a human is certainly more near than creating a computer that thinks like a human. 

I can only see four scenarios:

* Computers are made ultra efficient but still require human interaction. This provides us with security (robots will not wipe us out because they require us, don't bite that hand that feeds you).

* We can strive towards artificially intelligent computers that will long outlast humans with capabilities of reproduction (i.e. we are a stepping stone for the master race to evolve, which is quite interesting to think that nature created a completely abstract way of rearranging it's matter into life).

* Implement computers into humans to make us perform like computers but retain our humanly aspects.

* Create a 100% artificial human inside a computer that can think/feel/be conscious. This is the hardest of the four to achieve.

""[Pop music too loud and all sounds the same: official](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/x6u5n/pop_music_too_loud_and_all_sounds_the_same/)""

**TL;DR: Music in the future will be composed by technology which has a direct link in your brain, which knows exactly how to compose music based on your own preferences and experiences to recreate the emotions you want to evoke in yourself. You will be able to communicate many if not all of your feelings to others with this insta-music better than you ever could with words. In the average person's daily life, pop music written by a [few people](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/dtzi4/ever_wonder_why_pop_music_all_sounds_the_same/) will be replaced by [procedural music](http://arstechnica.com/science/2009/09/virtual-composer-makes-beautiful-musicand-stirs-controversy/) programmed by a few people.**

This article got my head going about how technology has changed what music the average person likes to listen to. I mean, how has pop music been changed by technological developments, and how that history could portend how the very idea of pop music changes in the future. This is all layman speculation and totally Euro-centric.

In the age before recordings, when all music was live, listening to music was a true luxury; performing it, even more so. Therefore, ""pop music"" catered to an ""elite"" group to an extent. If you did not have the means to be educated in nuanced music, then you were limited to appreciating relatively simple vocal songs or drum beats, or repetitive tribal music. Music was not part of the average person's everyday existence.

With rudimentary recordings, people could learn to feel music as part of an everyday existence; dance halls became popular and pop music boomed as the way to fill these venues with the best, most exciting beats possible with the limited technology. Orchestras of the 1800s were replaced by bands which usually featured drum beats that could create a fun, lively atmosphere, rather than stir other feelings which you might like to settle into in an otherwise-silent concert hall. 

With the advent of home stereos, society began to appreciate the wider range of possibilities for music, because you could listen to the same thing over and over during your daily routines at home. The Beatles, for example, stepped right through this opportune development with music that was great to appreciate by yourself and with others. But you still couldn't bring it with you.

The tape player, and later the CD player (and, I guess, portable radio) changed all that. Now, you could have (lower-fidelity) music whenever and wherever. The booming beats of the [loudness war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war) were egged on by the fact that now, people were buying music that they could listen to during the *most boring* moments of daily life, like when walking down the street or in the car. People had a soundtrack to their lives, music that could stimulate an otherwise inattentive brain.

The iPod is significant in my view for at least one thing else. It made it easy to exercise listening to music. Even a CD player is not convenient to bring for a run, and neither is a pack of CDs. Radio might have music with an uptempo beat, but its taste and fidelity leave something to be desired. You can have all the music you want, and with websites like spotify accessible from smartphones, you can discover all the music you want, with relatively little effort.

Where does that leave us? Fidelity, portability, and musical selection are nearly limitless--and it has left us with pop music that is catered to do one thing for the masses: wake us up. That's why pop music is so loud, so uptempo, so obsessed with themes like love and heartbreak. 

The future of music will inevitably expand in some way due to technology, but how? By creating music that is no longer geared for the masses, but for *you*. Music has always been an attempt to arouse emotions in people; pop music has rarely been created to arouse thoughts. The day will come when--for the average person, on their average day--a computer will know what you like to feel better than the best artists, and how to give that to you in a new, yet familiar way. Not only that, but if you want to express something that you can't quite nail down in words, these emotions will read and translated by that same process, essentially give another person your feelings. Sure, artists will still be around, but you won't *need* their works to satisfy your emotions, only their thoughts.

**In other words, we will all dance to the beats of our own drums. Thoughts?**
