I am planning to purchase 20 laptops out of my pocket for use in the classroom next year. Our school uses netbooks, but unfortunately they are not maintained to my standards by other classes. I am currently a technology teacher at an elementary/intermediate school. I see various classes throughout the day and wish I could spend more time with each class. I've made a decision to go back in the classroom and have a core group of students that I can work with, hopefully Grade 6-8.

What I'd like to focus on is creating a class of knowledge builders and to spark innovation and creativity without being tied down by a checklist curriculum. I want to build a community aimed at advancing best practices and moving problem based learning to a new level for my students.

Reddit has a wide array of users with many backgrounds. I'd love to hear your insight (inside and outside of education) into what an ideal classroom looks like.

But I want to check with something - hasn't this revolution of sorts already been happening? I mean think of it this way. Also, these statistics are hypothetical and me just trying to get the point across.

In 1850 90% of people work on farms, in order to grow food for 100% of the people. The other 10% do other businesses and the quality of life is at 1850's level - no power, no refrigeration, manual farming with animals for most people.

By 1900, 40% of people are in agriculture, 60% do other things, but the 50% who left agriculture didn't just stop working. Instead, the technologies that allowed them to leave their jobs allowed them to get new jobs in order to create an economy that creates a higher, 1900 level standard of living.

And then you have today, where like 2% of people work in agriculture and tons of people work in for example financial services, things like stock derivatives which are so involved it's amazing that people actually make money off of such abstract things. But it equates to an even higher living standard for us.

So wouldn't the whole jobless revolution not really come for at least a century until machines are far FAR cheaper and mentally capable to take up pretty much all market forces?

The perfect storm of destructive legislation is coming into full swing, and its effects will start to be felt about a year and a half from now. Authorities are tightening controls on what information you will be allowed to view, and which content providers will be permitted to stream material.

This means ISPs can have authority over which sites are allowed bandwidth, it gives them censorship rights according to private policy, and fiscal extorsion will be acceptable as a means to produce a broadcast. This already has been somewhat true in online marketing, but now the underdog will not even be allowed a platform to compete on. Don't want to shop through Amazon or Ebay, tough luck, other web merchants aren't permitted.

Between the MPAA, national service carriers, the patent ""industry"" and big tech companies, Alexis Ohanian's ""Gatekeepers"" are winning. That's not even mentioning the human impact of job automation and slashed welfare programs. 

The events unfolding are a pure and simple **attack** on the Abundance world view preached by Diamandis and Fresco. For the last two decades we've had a free internet, where speech and content were open to everyone. It has been very fortunate, but now we are headed towards a future where only large companies will be able to bribe ISPs to allow their services to run.

This means startups will no longer be allowed to be independent. Every new company will require large corporate sponsors that float the bill to pay ISPs for increased host costs and protection against patent trolls. Much in the same way that Microsoft recently lobbied for more [foreign visas at much higher cost](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/microsoft-stem-education-coalition-h1b-visa-outsourcing), this is taking from small companies and putting into the pockets of the big ones.

**The environment we're headed towards is one where the Gatekeepers build infrastructure that allows them to either directly own or illegalize the work being done by disruptive groups.** If we do reach true ""Abundance"" it will be at the mercy of [these finance organizations](http://i.imgur.com/5jo0knE.gif) and these [corporate identities.](http://stopsyjonizmowi.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/bilderberg.jpg)

There are some possible saviors. [Ethereum](http://www.ethereum.org/) looks promising as a means to author distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs) that use cryptocurrency as an exchange market. However, under new laws, P2P and WebRTC can be used for Piracy, and as such they can be discriminated against. 

We are looking at a future where blockchain traffic could be targeted against by ISPs, and the TPP might even have enough authority to illegalize many distributed technologies in the countries which signed on.

The era of functioning DAOs will come into full swing about a year from now, and the legislation to shut it down will be signed in at about the same time. And of course the authorities will have the full power of PRISM to monitor and crush any opposition to these new measures.

I really cannot see a fully positive future anymore.

Most of us in the West live under a capitalist system which demands that everyone have work, or be excluded from basic necessities like food and housing. At present, the number of people chronically unemployed is small, so the problem is managable.

But in the not-so-distant future, we will see more and more jobs vanish. They will be automated.

Of course, the service sector will grow and absorb some of these displaced people, but not all of them. Even the service sector will see automation.

So we are presented with a problem. We will very soon have structural unemployment at levels higher than a capitalist system can tolerate.  Indeed, its already beginning. The resulting economic inequity will cause political friction in the form of ""class warfare,"" as its so disparagingly termed by the wealthy.

Last time this happened was after the 2nd Industrial Revolution. At that time, we saw enormous inequity develop in which very small groups controlled most of the worlds resources. Shortly thereafter we saw the rise of Marxism and variants thereof.  Both the inequity and the marxist response proved hugely damaging to the world. However, after some time, the service sector exploded from a meager few percent to more than half of all employment.  This created more jobs free of automation, and allowed capitalism to continue. 

This time, we see the Information Revolution doing the same thing, but on an even grander scale. We're already seeing the inequity. It wont be long before Socialism rises again.

But this time, there wont be any jobs that cant be automated; no job a computer cant do.

The only jobs that remain will be those which do not yet have good robotic interfaces or which require a personal intimacy that we would not trust to machines. Things like retail clerks, therapists, prostitutes, and childcare. In the long term, not even technical and academic jobs like writer, researcher, software developer, and engineer will be safe from automation; AI will take over whole industries there, too.

So my questions are:

 What effect will this political upheaval have in the short term? Massive protests? Regime changes? Wars? How will particular nations handle it? Where will socialism spring up?

 (This is the really interesting one.) What will be the final outcome? What will our economic system look like in a post-automation world?



Edit: Some commenters seem to believe I expect all jobs to disappear. Not so. So, to clarify: I merely expect that most occupations will see a similar level of automation as factories do today; many people still are employed there, but far fewer than before. Many, perhaps even most, people will still be employed, but the number of chronically unemployed will become too great for traditional markets to manage. This is the premise of my inquiry.",90,104

You work for a company that sells the items it makes for 10. Of that 10 4 are labour costs. The company fires you and with robots can sell the items for 6. But you can't buy it for 6 because you have no job and no money. The sales tax puts the price back up to 10, pays you the 4 you use to get on the 15 of these you use to make every day.

The Roman economy also did not experience much need to automate or industrialize. Why spend effort and money to save work when you have slaves? Rome focused on food and trade. They went to war to get more lands and slaves to grow food and to trade. Source: http://www.unrv.com/economy.php

And they created their version of a basic income (Bread and circuses):

&gt;Later emperors all used **free or greatly subsidized grain** to keep the populace fed. The political use of the grain supply along with gladiatorial games and other entertainments gave rise to the saying ""Bread and circuses"". As the empire continued, the annona became more complex. During the reign of Septimius Severus, olive oil was added to the distribution. During the reign of Aurelian, however, a major reorganization of the alimenta took place. It appears that he ceased to distribute free grain; instead, **he issued free bread, and added salt, pork and wine to the dole**, which was provided free or at a reduced cost. These measures were continued by successive emperors

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_supply_to_the_city_of_Rome#Politics_and_the_grain_supply


Still, it was possible for a free Roman to compete with a slave, if only because a free Roman would be more motivated at his chosen job, than the forced slave. I don't think that will be true in our future. It doesn't matter how great a driver you are, self-driven trucks will be safer and don't need sleep.

So we can expect a Rome on steroids like economy, with automation doing almost everything.

But does that means we also really have no alternative than a basic income/negative income tax or government ""cheese""?

And once everything is automated, will that discourage or slow down innovation for us, as slavery apparently did for Rome?

We are living in possibly the greatest generation, because we were around for the VHS, now we're seeing the Smartphone, and someday soon we'll have Deus Ex style Cyberware. Once the singularity hits (I give it 40 years at most), then all bets are off, all boundaries are broken, and the stars are our playground. Every day I see dozens of new developments that I immediately think ""This is some of the raddest shit I have ever seen"". Technology is growing so explosively that I can't even keep up, and I'm trying! 

So the discrepancy comes from friends and coworkers who DON'T try. I just had a conversation with an old friend, and she admitted to not know what a Particle Accelerator is. Same goes for Carbon Nanotubes, Bionics, the Singularity, the Alcubierre Drive, the Higgs, etc. I don't expect them to know the details, and honestly, some of it is a little much for most people, but Carbon Nanotubes? Seriously? They were this HUGE buzzword for a long time!

The point is, I see the same issue in almost everyone around me. They seem to be completely unaware of any scientific developments over the last decade that don't involve their iPhones. Reasons range from not being interested, to not seeing why it matters, to not seeking the information, to just flat out not believing me at all when I show them articles and videos!

So my question is thus: How can I, and people like me, raise some awareness and passion out of the regrettably ignorant in our lives?",20,14

I believe that in the future government and judicial processes will be implemented using the block chain technology.  It will be a side effect of the economy moving to block chain systems and the natural requirements of a fast and global legal system. 

* Instead of depositing fiat in a centrally controlled bank I will send it to a block chain ledger that follows an exchange protocol (think NYSE) that opperates much like today's Mt.Gox or Bitstamp. 
* When there are disputes and cheats operating inside a protocol I'm involved with subroutines will arbitrate and distribute contractually arranged judgments. 
* Involvement in protocols will be voluntary and beneficial.
* These protocols will become so numerous as to all but eliminate the need for governance.
* The benefits of being involved with this sort of technology may go so far as to form a sort of market based minimum income for intelligence.

The beginnings of this sort of technology seem to be coming to fruition in [etherium](http://www.ethereum.org/).

In general, I see greater organization and speed moving into all systems. So, in this regard, the future should look like what we have today but more of it.  Even if it's not the block chain or etherium solving the problem it is a problem that will get solved.

I'm interested in learning how to implement new technology with human services/labor-type jobs that can be used to collect performance data and incentivize employee productivity over short periods of time. An example of this might be a window washing company that uses GPS tracking and augmented identification software to calculate the number of windows cleaned and steps taken by each worker, then rewarding the crew with the best overall statistics at the end of every month. 

Wearable devices such as Google Glass and Fitbit seem like the obvious solution for this sort of activity, but I'm also curious to know how these or other types of assistive technology can be used to excite productivity between teams of workers? Furthermore, what organizational models should be considered to allow these ideas to flow transparently throughout the business world in the next 5-10 years? 

The demographic I currently work with are Autistic individuals (mostly unemployed with a desire to work) who posses a strong understanding for video game mechanics. This has inspired me to find ways of combining rudimentary job tasks with theories such as ""gamification"" and the ""Quantified Self"" to train on the job and provide a clear breakdown of personal progress using a skill-tree leveling system. In addition, businesses could benefit by improving their status quo for labor production and identify new areas of service. 
 
The [training concept](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEHQJW-Y9Z4) I originally designed has proven difficult in acquisition among universities and local businesses in my area, so I am now back to the drawing board in hopes of creating a better training formula that could create more adaptive work environments in the coming months.
 

I'd love to get some insight on this subject and hear your feedback on how I can better convey some of these ideas with future businesses.

The news isn't good, Guy (a tenured professor at Arizona University) predicts at least a 4C rise in temperature by 2050, which he says means human extinction. 

Guy says the only answer is the dismantling of industrial society, and doesn't believe there is any chance of this happening in time.

The ruthlessly competitive Carnegie, the imperial Rockefeller, and the provocateur Gould were obsessed with progress, experiment, and speed. They were balanced by Morgan, the gentleman businessman, who fought, instead, for a global trust in American business.

There is a general trend for materials to become cheaper, but there seems to be no attempt to look for new materials, but methods to create fake impressions of existing ones. How is this progress? Why must we fake traditional styles?

You can't be a hacker if you got caught.

One time a preview in a movie theater told me I couldn't download a car so we stole the chair and put it on wheels[^[2]](http://i.imgur.com/eAvR2eh.jpg) and next week I sign the papers for a real one. I'm a young thirty something walking into corporate America[^[3]](http://i.imgur.com/7CdDKxa.jpg) as a virgin despite being guilty of a criminal past that stretches from on or around [1990](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#History) when I was about ten years old up until 2004.

Back then they weren't even crimes. I mean *we* ran the Internet, and really we still do. Maybe the mob doesn't run Vegas, but even giving the NSA the benefit of having a functioning quantum computer five years ago the future of this place is still run by the people you'll never read about in books. Geek culture is a funny thing to hear. I don't know when it became cool because I'm not cool. That's the hipster singularity. I was not cool before it was cool to not be cool and then stayed not cool.

OK, so they were kind of crimes but no one was going to jail but no body got hurt. I mean I was a kid who got to be a grown up on the internet everyday after school when the technology was in its infancy. I am a literally a *pioneer* in trolling and you wouldn't believe half of the truth. We were doing whatever we wanted to whoever we wanted and there was just nothing, just no one to stop us. No internet sheriff. You really dun goofed. But really it was never that malicious. Guys like that were the ones who got caught, well some of them anyway.

The older I got, or more accurately the closer to adulthood and thus the greater likelihood of criminal penalty ,the less and less outrageous (illegal) it became, but I never stopped reading about the evolution, architecture and design of what we are now using today or who the movers and shakers were. What was happening under the surface, and generally what people have been talking about since its beginning. Where it's going.

Against the backdrop of this maleficence... Don't give JD Salinger [unrestricted library access] to a twelve year old like me while simultaneously providing unrestricted computer privileges. Or maybe, do? When the phone bills got too high, well, we discovered phreaking, or what was left of it and the 80s scene. Prodigy, AOL, BBS', and my beautiful-beautiful IRC. One time I almost got arrested for building a bomb. We were the kind of kids who had to discover that the *Anarchist's Cookbook* was bullshit for ourselves in a rich Jewish neighborhood on a beautiful day during spring break in junior high.

Today you'd call it terrorism, probably. Maybe it would be a internet scandal about affluenza instead. 

Simultaneously against this backdrop of madness there was the classical education that I had the honor to be exposed to. Not only am I young today, but I'm the kind of guy who can sit down with a sixty year old and reminisce about the good old punch card days. I learned to program in seven languages that were obsolete before I graduated high school. I had an uncle who was (at the time) a senior VP at one of the (currently) largest computer companies in the world. I ""invented"" mp3's players when I was kid and tried to talk to him on the phone about this new thing but nobody would listen. I'm going back and editing this piece of writing as I go and since it's early morning and I'm drunk I might as well say fuck Steve Jobs and give nothing but love to the Wizard of Woz. Bill Gates a bad motherfucker who did what he had to do and now he's trying to save Africa and shit. Malcolm X said, *by any means necessary*, right? So what's up Google?

Before I dropped out of college I ran a topsite and if you downloaded a movie that was still in the theater and of screener quality around or just after Y2K there's a semi-decent chance that it touched my hands. Reddit's a big net and yeah, some of you definitely had my shit. Music. Software. Why sell pot when you can sell coke &amp; heyron and triple your profits? You can never make enough. Never. Hell I even stocked cams... which back then was like crack, or krokodil. I mean, we used to look down on people who watched those and considered them bottom-feeders but if it meant maxing out the three OC3's that I had access to at my uni's unrestricted network? I was pushing out terabytes a week before personal computers could support them without running a multi-disk RAID.[^[4]](http://i.imgur.com/Ng8KO6O.jpg) 

Fuck Frank Lucas and Nicky Barnes. It was never about money. It was about learning, doing, and exceeding ourselves. *Always*, *always* fucking pushing the limits and of course the lulz. I say that without ever having made a post on /b/, and while we're at it Guy Fawkes can go fuck himself, too.

All of that was before I could buy beer. Before I paid taxes. Before I got laid for the first time, and most importantly before I learned that the world can be a cold place when you're hungry. Before I saw what being homeless was about. 

And so a decade later I find myself reborn. An alien here in my own home. I first joined Facebook a year ago when I read a Forbes article that employers find it weird if you don't have an account. You Google my name and there is nothing. Just what I want there to be. What I want you to see. After years of thinking about how to download a car... working as a freelancer, working for free, fucking prostituting myself... after years I've risen clean to walk among you and collect a salary that separates me from 95% of the planet. 

Nothing but smoke and mirrors. Lies that can't be disproven. At one time I worked in a kitchen, and now I don't. [#Things_change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKkRDMil0bw).[^[5]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Change) If you can't prove a lie then it becomes the truth, right? Fake it until you make it. *We are at war with Eastasia. We've always been at war with Eastasia.*[^[6]](http://www.understandingpower.com/)

Now I'm walking into boardrooms and I'm the youngest person there, but I'm also the only person in the company who can do what I do. Many of the shiny toys that they have are things I've only read about. Applications that don't, or can't be pirated. Interfaces that are one thing to play with in a sandbox, but another when they apply globally to multiple relational databases. Every day I'm humbled by the middle-aged and retiring talent, many of whom were in college and first encountering the formal study of the thing that I learned how to break as a child. We shared the same classical education, *the original way it was learned*, if you will. A proverbial virgin who is often asked to do complex tasks using clunky platforms that I've never laid hands on... and yet, I can simplify it and using simpler tools automate the process. What took my predecessor 2-4 hours every month takes me 5 minutes to generate. Over the course of a year that's a savings of 35 hours. In a year I'll have automated almost my entire job and relegated it to a few batches. I'll be able to advise the company how it could consolidate five, ten, or twenty positions into one and save hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

Oddly enough I've emerged a vibrant republican. A ronin who not only now serves a master, but who is grateful to do so. The world is cold and hungry and the words of Cicero ring truer than those of John Locke. But fuck the GOP. I like to say that I hate computers, and I do, but I like to add that one cannot truly hate something until one truly understands that thing and in that capacity I now find myself the youngest and most capable person within a multimillion dollar company that has any sort of responsibility, and they even think I graduated. 

*The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...*

My feelings on Snowden are mixed. I take my responsibility very highly and to this day feel that it's still all about the lulz. My creed is intact, but now I'm using the system to keep myself warm. Minimum wage sounds like a joke when there is so much more out there, and all I can say is that I am grateful to work for a company that doesn't put my integrity on the line vis-a-viv my understanding of American political history. For the record, I don't think Snowden exposed anything illegal. Therein lies the problem. It should be illegal, but he broke rank and betrayed the thieves' code. Maybe there is no honor among thieves, but I am a Thief in Law and it's all I've ever known. What do you want me to pat him on the back and say thanks? Encrypt your shit, [anakata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfrid_Svartholm). I don't want to see my fucking face on a milk carton.

When you get to the dark corners of the web it isn't about your tattoos, it's about the things you can talk about and the names you can drop. In a weird way it's like the street and you have to get vouched for. You have to convince people you're worth their time and that you can have a conversation on their level. One time I remember being quizzed on the name of a freeware macro app that I used to send scripts thru. Couldn't remember what the software was? Must be a cop, or a liar. Those places still exist and I feel strengthened when I return to them for guidance on how to approach a technical problem. Politics don't matter there. Either you are or you aren't this thing or ours. If you got caught, well, then you aren't. At least not in present tense. 

The future is now. We are making it. I don't know if it's good or bad or where it will lead us. I will do an honest job and work ethically to advance myself. As [*Neuromancer*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) approaches my desire to divorce myself from this... world? It grows. I feel like a dinosaur amongst babes and yet I've only really just begun. In two years when I've mastered this next level of sophistication I will become truly dangerous. A couple of years after that and I should have enough money to retire to a quiet little beach somewhere in SE Asia. Maybe I'll open up a bar and put a sign out front that you can't use your smart phones and Instagram that shit.

Gentleman, we will build the future. We have the technology. How it will look will depend on our humanity. Not only can't you stop it, but you lack the ability even if you wanted to. 

&gt;&gt;The other bonus is another gift to us. The money earned by [this](http://www.filedropper.com/futl) novel will be going to directly and substantially support Heinlein's dream, and the dream we, Heinlein's Children, share. Earnings will be going to the advancement of human exploration of space. When you purchase ""For Us, the Living"" you are also contributing, in a real and meaningful way, the furtherment of this dream. Yet again, [Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein) 'pays it forward.'

My dream is to transform my physical body to something much closer to my ideal. I want to be curvy, pretty, voluptuous, etc. I want to have nice wide hips, narrow waist, slender shoulders, big round butt, shapely legs, and so on. I'd describe it as being a cross between an hourglass-figure and a pear-shaped figure. Hips wider than shoulders, with defined waist and such. Not everyone will agree, but I personally like that bodytype and want it for myself.

Right now I'm pretty far off the mark, and although I could go through with sexual-reassignment surgery, hormone-replace therapy, facial feminization surgery, voice training, etc., I feel I'd still fall far short of how I want to look. I won't be curvy, I won't have the big hips and small shoulders, I won't be pretty. It depresses me severely that I might have to go the rest of my life feeling ugly and unattractive!

Each Olympic season, the host nation plays a big part in trying to show off what it can do and what it has done in the past. Prior to the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremony was little more than a show to entertain prior to the lighting of the torch. Ever since Beijing, however, the Opening Ceremony has become a country's chance to show the entire world what makes it unique. 

Fast-forward to the year 2020, where Tokyo is the host city for the Olympics. Every host city gets to choose a motto that shapes that year's olympics. Beijing chose ""One World, One Dream"", Vancouver chose ""With Glowing Hearts"", London chose ""Sport at Heart... Inspire a Generation"", and Sochi chose ""Hot. Cool. Yours."" Tokyo has announced its motto for 2020 will be ""Discover Tomorrow"", with heavy emphasis on a futuristic look. 

The [stadium and surrounding buildings](http://tokyo2020.jp/en/plan/venue/) are designed to give off a futuristic vibe, and it is likely that their opening ceremony will as well. What kinds of things do you think Japan will utilize in its ceremony or throughout its hosting period?

I've noticed that pessimistic people point out that since the 1980s, most of our technological progress was only in computer technology. They say, ""Compare our lives now to someone in the 1980s: it's more or less the same except with smartphones and Facebook. There hasn't been any significant technological progress outside of consumer electronics and computing technology."" And they also point out that those accelerations were only due to Moore's Law, which is starting to end now. So soon we won't even have better computers.

And to be honest, I have a hard time seeing how they're wrong. I see optimistic futurists saying ""Things are accelerating"", but are they really? Can anyone provide a good, solid counter-example to what the pessimists and naysayers are saying? Is the future going to accelerate or is it just going to be a big slog of incremental progress?

I really REALLY want the pessimists to be wrong, so I'm hoping you guys can give me solid examples of accelerating returns that don't have to do with consumer electronics, computers, etc. Will multiple fields start to ""take off"" in the coming years and decades?",58,57

I decided that if LENR came out I could place a greenhouse in my back yard (one of those massive ones using plastic for walls).  I could then have a heat pump running inside it 24/7 keeping a perfect growing temp.  I could also line the ceiling with LED grow lights allowing my food to grow 24/7.  I could run humidifiers or dehumidifiers as needed.  If the cost to power this greenhouse was 0.01c per hour who cares right?  I would likely end up with more food than I know what to do with.  It would be spray free as well.  With energy cost a non-issue I could even see companies making greenhouse kitsets, they would probably draw 3-5KW 24/7 but who cares if the energy is essentially free.",3,2

Global Governance is the mechanisms which work to create peace in the absence of government. NGOs, IOs, civil society etc. are all contributing factors in global governance, but I fear that AI systems programmed to support the interests of governments and the private sector will result in a world where [human security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_security) ""for all"" will not be achievable. Instead, state and profit seeking behaviors may lead the world into an Elysium type of scenario. Ultimately, it's how AI's are programmed to behave that will determine how they effect humanity. Are there any AI systems currently working on global governance issues? If not, what are your opinions on creating ""protector AIs"" that are programmed specifically to solve problems threatening humanity, create sustainable peace, and mitigate state interests?

I'm doing a 3-year bachelors degree (commerce), in which my university permits me to do a masters of engineering. I'd rather not do engineering because the pay is shit compared to finance jobs (Investment banking, hedge fund). Im more inclined to work for a bank because:


	Id rather work 70+ hours a week to make $80,000 + bonuses (average graduate starting salary) as opposed to earning $65,000 working 35-50 hours per week.

	Im not interested in relationships, I dont go out on dates nor do I want to commit to a relationship.

	The banking employee system rewards people which bring in the most people to the company and disbands poor working employees, call me crazy but I think Id thrive in that system.

	Did I mention I love money?
Goldman Sachs and HSBC are always looking for new recruits at my Uni.

We often talk about and lament the fact that we live in an age that is too old to explore the Earth, but too young to explore our solar system, our galaxy, and our universe (yes, I said our universe... Google multi-verse theory if you want to have your mind aptly blown for the day). 

Indeed, one of the reasons I've decided to pursue Cognitive Science is that I see our brain as a relatively new, uncharted frontier. One that we've had since the dawn of our species (although it has grown and evolved) but have never had the full capacity to explore... until now. I believe that fully understanding and controlling the potential(s) of our brain(s) is the last step in charting, exploring, and understanding our planet &amp; species, and the first step in understanding literally everything else. 

The truly exciting revelation that I had this evening, while working on some coursework, is that even while we are still trying to understand our brains and how to explore our own minds (introspection in the purest form), we are already laying the groundwork for the next age of exploration; Space. 

One of the most interesting things I've learned this semester are the principles and theories surrounding visualization and its correlation with actually doing a task. That is to say, for the sake of this argument, that when you visualize doing something, your brain activity spikes in the same way that it would if you were ACTUALLY doing that activity, albeit at a smaller margin. Furthermore, if you are put in a simulated environment (think flight simulator), your brain is able to create the connections it needs to actually do those tasks in its fullest capacity. You can, theoretically, learn to do something (or most of the tasks associated with that specific action) by simply visualizing it, and/or simulating the experience. 

Here's where it all ties together and gets really damn cool. 

With the assistance of technology, we're beginning to create tools that aid us in learning things that we either can't do, are too scared to do (in a real life scenario), or don't have the adequate ""analogue"" counterparts to do. Go and look at the articles and companies that are growing in Brain-Computer-Interface technology (Cyberkinetics, BrainGate)... Yea, as in controlling a computer with your brain alone. Also, while you're at it, look at the advancements in artificial limbs, and some of the exoskeleton prototypes that are coming out that aren't replacing limbs, but actually reinforcing pre-existing ones. Think cyborg/terminator/Master Chief level stuff... Its becoming a reality. 

One thing that I find immensely interesting is how gaming is progressing. We're approaching a point where we can't distinguish real-time computer generated images from their real life counterparts. Also, with the Oculus rift coming out sometime this year, we'll be able to experience games that touch on the first kinds of fully immersive virtual reality on a widespread consumer scale. Games are starting to create these immersive simulations as well (think back to learning). 

Go and YouTube search ""Star Citizen"". Its an upcoming game that integrates the Oculus Rift into its software, and is basically an open ""world"" space simulator that has elements of RPG's, FPS, and flight-sims in it. In addition to being graphically beautiful, its also essentially doing one thing to its players, without them even being aware of it.

They're learning to fly spacecraft. 

Now I realize this isn't the first flight-sim, or open world flight game etc. etc., but it combines pretty much all of the elements I've touched on above. Considering that, is this game not a manifestation of people having an inherent interest in wanting to learn how to fly in space? Is that not a portion of people that are starting to lay the groundwork for the upcoming era(s) of space exploration?!

People say that America's interest in space has diminished with the decrease in funding to NASA... I think we're just getting started, and the generations to come will have an inherent curiosity and propensity to explore space more-so than any of us, because it will become an attainable goal. 

I'm getting chills just writing this... Like I said, it was too exciting not to share. I hope you've found it interesting. 

**TL;DR - I'm studying Cognitive Science and am finding huge distinctions in how it ties in with technology, space, gaming, and a variety of other interesting things that are relevant to r/Futurology. I want to hear some of your opinions on these topics.**


**Also, this was first posted on Facebook, so if I come off as condescending, it is unintentional. I was just trying to simplify some of the topics to get my point(s) across. If you see anything that's incorrect or you find to be different, please say so in the comments! I don't want to pretend to be an expert, but instead show that I'm a student! I'm trying to get an exciting discussion going!**

A sensor worn on someone suffering from incontinence will keep a constant connection with a teleporter and have it beam away all wastes when the bladder and bowels are half-full. (Or set to quarter-full for safer measures.)

Diapers cost parents and insurers quite a bit every year, so putting a discreet sensor on a child or patient that signals a teleporter to beam away waste could $ave an epic bundle of dough every year.

**A FEW NOTES ON THE CULTURE - PART I**


**Introduction**

The Culture is a group-civilisation formed from seven or eight humanoid species, space-living elements of which established a loose federation approximately nine thousand years ago. The ships and habitats which formed the original alliance required each others' support to pursue and maintain their independence from the political power structures - principally those of mature nation-states and autonomous commercial concerns - they had evolved from.

The galaxy (our galaxy) in the Culture stories is a place long lived-in, and scattered with a variety of life-forms. In its vast and complicated history it has seen waves of empires, federations, colonisations, die-backs, wars, species-specific dark ages, renaissances, periods of mega-structure building and destruction, and whole ages of benign indifference and malign neglect. At the time of the Culture stories, there are perhaps a few dozen major space-faring civilisations, hundreds of minor ones, tens of thousands of species who might develop space-travel, and an uncountable number who have been there, done that, and have either gone into locatable but insular retreats to contemplate who-knows-what, or disappeared from the normal universe altogether to cultivate lives even less comprehensible.

In this era, the Culture is one of the more energetic civilisations, and initially - after its formation, which was not without vicissitudes - by a chance of timing found a relatively quiet galaxy around it, in which there were various other fairly mature civilisations going about their business, traces and relics of the elder cultures scattered about the place, and - due to the fact nobody else had bothered to go wandering on a grand scale for a comparatively long time - lots of interesting 'undiscovered' star systems to explore... 


**Anarchy**

The Culture, in its history and its on-going form, is an expression of the idea that the nature of space itself determines the type of civilisations which will thrive there.

The thought processes of a tribe, a clan, a country or a nation-state are essentially two-dimensional, and the nature of their power depends on the same flatness. Territory is all-important; resources, living-space, lines of communication; all are determined by the nature of the plane (that the plane is in fact a sphere is irrelevant here); that surface, and the fact the species concerned are bound to it during their evolution, determines the mind-set of a ground-living species. The mind-set of an aquatic or avian species is, of course, rather different.

Essentially, the contention is that our currently dominant power systems cannot long survive in space; beyond a certain technological level a degree of anarchy is arguably inevitable and anyway preferable.

To survive in space, ships/habitats must be self-sufficient, or very nearly so; the hold of the state (or the corporation) over them therefore becomes tenuous if the desires of the inhabitants conflict significantly with the requirements of the controlling body. On a planet, enclaves can be surrounded, besieged, attacked; the superior forces of a state or corporation - hereafter referred to as hegemonies - will tend to prevail. In space, a break-away movement will be far more difficult to control, especially if significant parts of it are based on ships or mobile habitats. The hostile nature of the vacuum and the technological complexity of life support mechanisms will make such systems vulnerable to outright attack, but that, of course, would risk the total destruction of the ship/habitat, so denying its future economic contribution to whatever entity was attempting to control it.

Outright destruction of rebellious ships or habitats - pour encouragez les autres - of course remains an option for the controlling power, but all the usual rules of uprising realpolitik still apply, especially that concerning the peculiar dialectic of dissent which - simply stated - dictates that in all but the most dedicatedly repressive hegemonies, if in a sizable population there are one hundred rebels, all of whom are then rounded up and killed, the number of rebels present at the end of the day is not zero, and not even one hundred, but two hundred or three hundred or more; an equation based on human nature which seems often to baffle the military and political mind. Rebellion, then (once space-going and space-living become commonplace), becomes easier than it might be on the surface of a planet.

Even so, this is certainly the most vulnerable point in the time-line of the Culture's existence, the point at which it is easiest to argue for things turning out quite differently, as the extent and sophistication of the hegemony's control mechanisms - and its ability and will to repress - battles against the ingenuity, skill, solidarity and bravery of the rebellious ships and habitats, and indeed the assumption here is that this point has been reached before and the hegemony has won... but it is also assumed that - for the reasons given above - that point is bound to come round again, and while the forces of repression need to win every time, the progressive elements need only triumph once.

Concomitant with this is the argument that the nature of life in space - that vulnerability, as mentioned above - would mean that while ships and habitats might more easily become independent from each other and from their legally progenitative hegemonies, their crew - or inhabitants - would always be aware of their reliance on each other, and on the technology which allowed them to live in space. The theory here is that the property and social relations of long-term space-dwelling (especially over generations) would be of a fundamentally different type compared to the norm on a planet; the mutuality of dependence involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without. This broad result is - in the long run - independent of the initial social and economic conditions which give rise to it.


**Economy**

Let me state here a personal conviction that appears, right now, to be profoundly unfashionable; which is that a planned economy can be more productive - and more morally desirable - than one left to market forces.

The market is a good example of evolution in action; the try-everything-and-see-what- -works approach. This might provide a perfectly morally satisfactory resource-management system so long as there was absolutely no question of any sentient creature ever being treated purely as one of those resources. The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is - without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset - intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.

It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] - through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others - a kind of synthetic evil.

Intelligence, which is capable of looking farther ahead than the next aggressive mutation, can set up long-term aims and work towards them; the same amount of raw invention that bursts in all directions from the market can be - to some degree - channelled and directed, so that while the market merely shines (and the feudal gutters), the planned lases, reaching out coherently and efficiently towards agreed-on goals. What is vital for such a scheme, however, and what was always missing in the planned economies of our world's experience, is the continual, intimate and decisive participation of the mass of the citizenry in determining these goals, and designing as well as implementing the plans which should lead towards them.

Of course, there is a place for serendipity and chance in any sensibly envisaged plan, and the degree to which this would affect the higher functions of a democratically designed economy would be one of the most important parameters to be set... but just as the information we have stored in our libraries and institutions has undeniably outgrown (if not outweighed) that resident in our genes, and just as we may, within a century of the invention of electronics, duplicate - through machine sentience - a process which evolution took billions of years to achieve, so we shall one day abandon the grossly targeted vagaries of the market for the precision creation of the planned economy.

The Culture, of course, has gone beyond even that, to an economy so much a part of society it is hardly worthy of a separate definition, and which is limited only by imagination, philosophy (and manners), and the idea of minimally wasteful elegance; a kind of galactic ecological awareness allied to a desire to create beauty and goodness.

Whatever; in the end practice (as ever) will outshine theory. 


**Artificial Intelligence/The Minds**

As mentioned above, there is another force at work in the Culture aside from the nature of its human inhabitants and the limitations and opportunities presented by life in space, and that is Artificial Intelligence. This is taken for granted in the Culture stories, and - unlike FTL travel - is not only likely in the future of our own species, but probably inevitable (always assuming homo sapiens avoids destruction).

Certainly there are arguments against the possibility of Artificial Intelligence, but they tend to boil down to one of three assertions: one, that there is some vital field or other presently intangible influence exclusive to biological life - perhaps even carbon-based biological life - which may eventually fall within the remit of scientific understanding but which cannot be emulated in any other form (all of which is neither impossible nor likely); two, that self-awareness resides in a supernatural soul - presumably linked to a broad-based occult system involving gods or a god, reincarnation or whatever - and which one assumes can never be understood scientifically (equally improbable, though I do write as an atheist); and, three, that matter cannot become self-aware (or more precisely that it cannot support any informational formulation which might be said to be self-aware or taken together with its material substrate exhibit the signs of self-awareness). ...I leave all the more than nominally self-aware readers to spot the logical problem with that argument.

It is, of course, entirely possible that real AIs will refuse to have anything to do with their human creators (or rather, perhaps, the human creators of their non-human creators), but assuming that they do - and the design of their software may be amenable to optimization in this regard - I would argue that it is quite possible they would agree to help further the aims of their source civilisation (a contention we'll return to shortly). At this point, regardless of whatever alterations humanity might impose on itself through genetic manipulation, humanity would no longer be a one-sentience-type species. The future of our species would affect, be affected by and coexist with the future of the AI life-forms we create.

The Culture reached this phase at around the same time as it began to inhabit space. Its AIs cooperate with the humans of the civilisation; at first the struggle is simply to survive and thrive in space; later - when the technology required to do so has become mundane - the task becomes less physical, more metaphysical, and the aims of civilisation moral rather than material.

Briefly, nothing and nobody in the Culture is exploited. It is essentially an automated civilisation in its manufacturing processes, with human labour restricted to something indistinguishable from play, or a hobby.

No machine is exploited, either; the idea here being that any job can be automated in such a way as to ensure that it can be done by a machine well below the level of potential consciousness; what to us would be a stunningly sophisticated computer running a factory (for example) would be looked on by the Culture's AIs as a glorified calculator, and no more exploited than an insect is exploited when it pollinates a fruit tree a human later eats a fruit from.

Where intelligent supervision of a manufacturing or maintenance operation is required, the intellectual challenge involved (and the relative lightness of the effort required) would make such supervision rewarding and enjoyable, whether for human or machine. The precise degree of supervision required can be adjusted to a level which satisfies the demand for it arising from the nature of the civilisation's members. People - and, I'd argue, the sort of conscious machines which would happily cooperate with them - hate to feel exploited, but they also hate to feel useless. One of the most important tasks in setting up and running a stable and internally content civilisation is finding an acceptable balance between the desire for freedom of choice in one's actions (and the freedom from mortal fear in one's life) and the need to feel that even in a society so self-correctingly Utopian one is still contributing something. Philosophy matters, here, and sound education.

From one point of view, I think you could argue that they'd do worse because of the program they'd operate from that would struggle to distinguish between weather conditions. 
  
On the other hand, you could argue they would do significantly better because of their lack of reliance on sight. I would imagine specialized sensors would do most of the ""seeing"" in those instances. Additionally, many people don't know how to drive effectively in the snow (too much acceleration, etc.), it seems like an autonomous vehicle would have a higher capability to maintain traction dynamically.

So many great ideas and concepts come through here, only to be forgotten months later. I get so hyped up about everything I see in this subreddit, but rarely does any of it come to fruition. Yes, I realize progress is slow. I guess I'm just sick of waiting. I feel let down.

Every video I see has these experts talking about these amazing things to come, how and why they are inevitable. Sometimes I worry that it's all just idealistic, wishful thinking. I feel like there are a million ways all these things can go wrong and only a few ways they can be implemented correctly. How do we know they will be? What are the chances?

Part of the reason for my frustration is because, aside from this subreddit, I know virtually no one who knows about futurist concepts. And if they do, they don't seem to even care. And I am sitting here feeling like this is the only thing that matters right now. This is the future that is happening right now. Again, aside from this subreddit, all of this just falls on deaf ears. 

Up until now I've been strictly just a long time lurker. But because of these frustrations, I really want to take an active role in spreading awareness of the concepts of futurology. Starting with this subreddit.

Everyone I see in these relative fields are reknown professors, businessmen, engineers I'm not sure if I could survive going through another several years of schooling and sacrificing that kind of money and time to do that. Is this the only route to be able to pursue my passion?  And I wonder, without these credentials, who would even listen?

**A FEW NOTES ON THE CULTURE - PART II**


**Education**

Education in the Culture is something that never ends; it may be at its most intense in the first tenth or so of an individual's life, but it goes on until death (another subject we'll return to). To live in the Culture is to live in a fundamentally rational civilisation (this may preclude the human species from ever achieving something similar; our history is, arguably, not encouraging in this regard). The Culture is quite self-consciously rational, sceptical, and materialist. Everything matters, and nothing does. Vast though the Culture may be - thirty trillion people, scattered fairly evenly through the galaxy - it is thinly spread, exists for now solely in this one galaxy, and has only been around for an eyeblink, compared to the life of the universe. There is life, and enjoyment, but what of it? Most matter is not animate, most that is animate is not sentient, and the ferocity of evolution pre-sentience (and, too often, post-sentience) has filled uncountable lives with pain and suffering. And even universes die, eventually. (Though we'll come back to that, too.)

In the midst of this, the average Culture person - human or machine - knows that they are lucky to be where they are when they are. Part of their education, both initially and continually, comprises the understanding that beings less fortunate - though no less intellectually or morally worthy - than themselves have suffered and, elsewhere, are still suffering. For the Culture to continue without terminal decadence, the point needs to be made, regularly, that its easy hedonism is not some ground-state of nature, but something desirable, assiduously worked for in the past, not necessarily easily attained, and requiring appreciation and maintenance both in the present and the future. 


**Philosophy &amp; Purpose**

An understanding of the place the Culture occupies in the history and development of life in the galaxy is what helps drive the civilisation's largely cooperative and - it would claim - fundamentally benign techno-cultural diplomatic policy, but the ideas behind it go deeper. Philosophically, the Culture accepts, generally, that questions such as 'What is the meaning of life?' are themselves meaningless. The question implies - indeed an answer to it would demand - a moral framework beyond the only moral framework we can comprehend without resorting to superstition (and thus abandoning the moral framework informing - and symbiotic with - language itself).

In summary, we make our own meanings, whether we like it or not.

The same self-generative belief-system applies to the Culture's AIs. They are designed (by other AIs, for virtually all of the Culture's history) within very broad parameters, but those parameters do exist; Culture AIs are designed to want to live, to want to experience, to desire to understand, and to find existence and their own thought-processes in some way rewarding, even enjoyable.

The humans of the Culture, having solved all the obvious problems of their shared pasts to be free from hunger, want, disease and the fear of natural disaster and attack, would find it a slightly empty existence only and merely enjoying themselves, and so need the good-works of the Contact section to let them feel vicariously useful. For the Culture's AIs, that need to feel useful is largely replaced by the desire to experience, but as a drive it is no less strong. The universe - or at least in this era, the galaxy - is waiting there, largely unexplored (by the Culture, anyway), its physical principles and laws quite comprehensively understood but the results of fifteen billion years of the chaotically formative application and interaction of those laws still far from fully mapped and evaluated.

By Godel out of Chaos, the galaxy is, in other words, an immensely, intrinsically, and inexhaustibly interesting place; an intellectual playground for machines that know everything except fear and what lies hidden within the next uncharted stellar system.

This is where I think one has to ask why any AI civilisation - and probably any sophisticated culture at all - would want to spread itself everywhere in the galaxy (or the universe, for that matter). It would be perfectly possible to build a Von Neumann machine that would build copies of itself and eventually, unless stopped, turn the universe into nothing but those self-copies, but the question does arise; why? What is the point? To put it in what we might still regard as frivolous terms but which the Culture would have the wisdom to take perfectly seriously, where is the fun in that?

Interest - the delight in experience, in understanding - comes from the unknown; understanding is a process as well as a state, denoting the shift from the unknown to the known, from the random to the ordered... a universe where everything is already understood perfectly and where uniformity has replaced diversity, would, I'd contend, be anathema to any self-respecting AI.

Probably only humans find the idea of Von Neumann machines frightening, because we half-understand - and even partially relate to - the obsessiveness of the ethos such constructs embody. An AI would think the idea mad, ludicrous and - perhaps most damning of all - boring.

This is not to say that the odd Von-Neumann-machine event doesn't crop up in the galaxy every now and again (probably by accident rather than design), but something so rampantly monomaniac is unlikely to last long pitched against beings possessed of a more rounded wit, and which really only want to alter the Von Neumann machine's software a bit and make friends... 


**Cultural change**

One idea behind the Culture as it is depicted in the stories is that it has gone through cyclical stages during which there has been extensive human-machine interfacing, and other stages (sometimes coinciding with the human-machine eras) when extensive genetic alteration has been the norm. The era of the stories written so far - dating from about 1300 AD to 2100 AD - is one in which the people of the Culture have returned, probably temporarily, to something more 'classical' in terms of their relations with the machines and the potential of their own genes.

The Culture recognises, expects and incorporates fashions - albeit long-term fashions - in such matters. It can look back to times when people lived much of their lives in what we would now call cyberspace, and to eras when people chose to alter themselves or their children through genetic manipulation, producing a variety of morphological sub-species. Remnants of the various waves of such civilisational fashions can be found scattered throughout the Culture, and virtually everyone in the Culture carries the results of genetic manipulation in every cell of their body; it is arguably the most reliable signifier of Culture status. 


**Biological engineering**

Thanks to that genetic manipulation, the average Culture human will be born whole and healthy and of significantly (though not immensely) greater intelligence than their basic human genetic inheritance might imply. There are thousands of alterations to that human-basic inheritance - blister-free callusing and a clot-filter protecting the brain are two of the less important ones mentioned in the stories - but the major changes the standard Culture person would expect to be born with would include an optimized immune system and enhanced senses, freedom from inheritable diseases or defects, the ability to control their autonomic processes and nervous system (pain can, in effect, be switched off), and to survive and fully recover from wounds which would either kill or permanently mutilate without such genetic tinkering.

The vast majority of people are also born with greatly altered glands housed within their central nervous systems, usually referred to as 'drug glands'. These secrete - on command - mood- and sensory-appreciation-altering compounds into the person's bloodstream. A similar preponderance of Culture inhabitants have subtly altered reproductive organs - and control over the associated nerves - to enhance sexual pleasure. Ovulation is at will in the female, and a fetus up to a certain stage may be re-absorbed, aborted, or held at a static point in its development; again, as willed. An elaborate thought-code, self-administered in a trance-like state (or simply a consistent desire, even if not conscious) will lead, over the course of about a year, to what amounts to a viral change from one sex into the other. The convention - tradition, even - in the Culture during the time of the stories written so far is that each person should give birth to one child in their lives. In practice, the population grows slowly. (And sporadically, in addition, for other reasons, as we'll come to later.)

To us, perhaps, the idea of being able to find out what sex is like for our complimentary gender, or being able to get drunk/stoned/tripped-out or whatever just by thinking about it (and of course the Culture's drug-glands produce no unpleasant side-effects or physiological addiction) may seem like mere wish-fulfilment. And indeed it is partly wish-fulfilment, but then the fulfilment of wishes is both one of civilisation's most powerful drives and arguably one of its highest functions; we wish to live longer, we wish to live more comfortably, we wish to live with less anxiety and more enjoyment, less ignorance and more knowledge than our ancestors did... but the abilities to change sex and to alter one's brain-chemistry - without resort to external technology or any form of payment - both have more serious functions within the Culture. A society in which it is so easy to change sex will rapidly find out if it is treating one gender better than the other; within the population, over time, there will gradually be greater and greater numbers of the sex it is more rewarding to be, and so pressure for change - within society rather than the individuals - will presumably therefore build up until some form of sexual equality and hence numerical parity is established. In a similar fashion, a society in which everybody is free to, and does, choose to spend the majority of their time zonked out of their brains will know that there is something significantly wrong with reality, and (one would hope) do what it can to make that reality more appealing and less - in the pejorative sense - mundane.

Implicit in the stories so far is that through self-correcting mechanisms of this nature the Culture reached a rough steady-state in such matters thousands of years ago, and has settled into a kind of long-lived civilisational main sequence which should last for the forseeable future, and thousands of generations.

Which brings us to the length of those generations, and the fact that they can be said to exist at all. Humans in the Culture normally live about three-and-a-half to four centuries. The majority of their lives consists of a three-century plateau which they reach in what we would compare to our mid-twenties, after a relatively normal pace of maturation during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. They age very slowly during those three hundred years, then begin to age more quickly, then they die.

Philosophy, again; death is regarded as part of life, and nothing, including the universe, lasts forever. It is seen as bad manners to try and pretend that death is somehow not natural; instead death is seen as giving shape to life.

While burial, cremation and other - to us - conventional forms of body disposal are not unknown in the Culture, the most common form of funeral involves the deceased - usually surrounded by friends - being visited by a Displacement Drone, which - using the technique of near-instantaneous transmission of a remotely induced singularity via hyperspace - removes the corpse from its last resting place and deposits it in the core of the relevant system's sun, from where the component particles of the cadaver start a million-year migration to the star's surface, to shine - possibly - long after the Culture itself is history.

None of this, of course, is compulsory (nothing in the Culture is compulsory). Some people choose biological immortality; others have their personality transcribed into AIs and die happy feeling they continue to exist elsewhere; others again go into Storage, to be woken in more (or less) interesting times, or only every decade, or century, or aeon, or over exponentially increasing intervals, or only when it looks like something really different is happening...

But I am worried that technology isn't progressing fast enough. Recently, someone posted a pic of his flash drive from 2004, which had 64 mb, and his flash drive in 2014, which has 64 gb. That is a 1000 fold increase, but the question I have to ask myself is, how is this improvement impacting my life? Yes, over the past 10 years the internet has improved a bit, internet speeds have increased a bit, computers are much much faster, and we now have smartphones and tablets. Yet, I have to say, my life has not changed much from 2004.

Ray kurzweil frequently likes to say that a kid in africa has access to much more information through his smartphone than the president had 15 years ago and also that this smartphone would have worth millions of dollars 15 years ago. Yet, is this kid actually better off? The smartphone and the information isn't probably of much use to him. What good is a smartphone when you can't even eat? Rich people who lived thousands of years ago probably had a much higher quality of life than most of us do in our ''high-tech world.''

To me, as long as most of the world's population live in abject poverty and as long as we all have to ''work'', the future isn't here. Only the day when no one has to work pointless jobs in order to feed themselves will I consider our civilization to be high-tech.

Money is necessary for survival in our current system governed by rules and laws.  We need it to get food, clothing, and shelther and other basic necessities.  Without money, people cannot function in modern society.  Despite the importance of money, it is remarkable how such a key component of modern life is misunderstood by so many, even those that control the rules and laws.

What is money?  Modern money is simply a note created by debt called currency.  Only banks can create currency by making loans to persons, businesses, and governments.  Those who are recipients of bank loans are those who are first in line to receive freshly minted currency.  People accumulate and trade bank notes among each other defining success and the relationships we call modern civilization.  Without access to currency, people can't function in the current economy.

Since economic success is measured by money, the more loans banks make, the bigger our economy grows.  Banks traditionally issued loans to those who were reasonably expected to pay the loans back through productivity.  Since bank loans require the repayment of principal and interest, it is necessary for banks to make sufficient new loans in order for there to be enough currency to pay both principal and accumulating interest obigations systemically.   Before banks were considered too big to fail, there was a strong relationship between increasing debt, expanding productivity, and economic growth.

Now that automation and other technology are driving unprecedented productive efficiency and rapidly replacing the need for people to labor, it is becoming impossible for banks to legitimately make sufficient new loans to support the current debt based money system.  Consequently, in order to perpetuate the current system, bankers are making loans to governments, businesses, and individuals that they know can't be paid back.  

Bankers making loans that can't paid back through productivity is fraud and similar to a ponzi scheme.  The fraudulent lending practices of banks to a vulnerable population is essentially what caused the financial crisis of 2008.  Today, people are again unknowingly participating in another fraudulent ponzi scheme that is contributing to the destruction of our society and biological ecosystems globally.  

We are extending this game of debts by collectively accepting the narrative that the banks are ""too big to fail.""  Since banks no longer have to fear failure, there is effectively no limitations on bankers' lending practices.  People and politicians have become dependent to the whims of bankers to allocate credit and money.  Whenever one person can print money without recourse for what another must labor, steal or beg, the laborer is the slave of the printer. If we don't evolve our our money system to reflect our technological advancements and environmental constraints, we can be confident that stress and frustration will spiral out of control in a culture where consumption is now dependent on fraudulent lending practices of a few to allocate resources among the many.

**""Failure Is Success In Progress""  Albert Einstein**  
""Too Big To Fail"" has always been a lie.  Kings thought they were too big to fail.  Slave owners thought they were too big to fail.  Dictators and tyrants thought they were too big to fail.  Today bankers, politicians, and other ""elites"" think they are too big to fail in an unsustainable game based on consumption.  The game is being enforced by obsolete rules and laws that no longer serve society just like what happened in the earlier too big to fail systems.

Too big to fail at its core is theft as it fraudulently takes from the many and gives to the few.  It takes a legitimate game and turns it into a rigged outcome.  Profits achieved in a too big to fail system are tainted by the system itself.  Gains in such a system make any profits obtained no different than the the loot of a thief.  For the past one hundred years, the current financial system controlled essentially every aspect of human life in the consumption game. The more people consumed things that they didn't need, the bigger the financial system grew.  When society was recently told the financial system was too big to fail, we all should have realized it was time to evolve into a new system.  

**New Thinking Will Unlock Potential**  
The lubricant of civilization is trust. In a specialized world, we rely on trust in each other and trust in our systems for our daily existence. For a variety of economic and environmental reasons, ideas that worked for a few are now failing for the many. By clearing all debt and connecting people, we can move beyond current limitations into new systems that everyone can trust. 

Any thoughts on what kind of system can we trust?",31,9

In it, Cliff presents an argument against the vision of an Internet revolution:

&gt;Visionaries see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic.

&gt;Baloney. Do our computer pundits lack all common sense? The truth in no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works.

I thought it would be a fun exercise to step through Cliff's arguments and see how his predictions have panned out over the last 19 years.

    1. Democratic speech

&gt;Consider today's online world. The Usenet, a worldwide bulletin board, allows anyone to post messages across the nation. Your word gets out, leapfrogging editors and publishers. Every voice can be heard cheaply and instantly. The result? Every voice is heard. The cacophany more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harrasment, and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen.

The cacophony still exists. I immediately think of YouTube comments, XBox Live participants, and 4chan. However, the Internet has evolved methods to filter meaningful content from noise without the need for a central authority, like an editor or publisher. [Blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), [Podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast),  and [Web Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) allow Internet users to create media content. [Social networking services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service) allow this content to be shared democratically and acts as a word of mouth filter. Additionally, sites like Reddit allow users to vote directly on content to directly determine what signals arise from the cacophony. 

Still other sites like [BuzzFeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed) aggregate content by applying the old-world publisher model to new-world viral content.

    2. Electronic publishing

&gt;How about electronic publishing? Try reading a book on disc. At best, it's an unpleasant chore: the myopic glow of a clunky computer replaces the friendly pages of a book. And you can't tote that laptop to the beach. Yet Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Intenet. Uh, sure.

This one is pretty funny :)

The problem here is that Cliff assumes computer hardware will not improve with time. The typical beach in 2014 is littered with computers: mp3 players, smartphones, and people with e-book readers relaxing on the shore.

    3. Information retrieval

&gt;What the Internet hucksters won't tell you is tht the Internet is one big ocean of unedited data, without any pretense of completeness. Lacking editors, reviewers or critics, the Internet has become a wasteland of unfiltered data. You don't know what to ignore and what's worth reading. Logged onto the World Wide Web, I hunt for the date of the Battle of Trafalgar. Hundreds of files show up, and it takes 15 minutes to unravel themone's a biography written by an eighth grader, the second is a computer game that doesn't work and the third is an image of a London monument. None answers my question, and my search is periodically interrupted by messages like, ""Too many connections, try again later.""

This seems strange now that [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) has become ubiquitous, but it shows just how vital an intelligent search algorithm is to the modern Internet. Also, a big shout-out to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) which uses a democratic system to create and regulate the largest general reference work of all time. Together, these two technologies form the perfect counter-argument to much of Cliff's article.

In 1995, Cliff's search for the date of the Battle of Trafalgar stalled out. In 2014, I pressed Ctl + T in my browser, typed *Battle of Trafalgar*, pressed enter, and Google retrieved the Battle's Wikipedia page in .27 seconds.

The date Cliff was looking for is October 21st, 1805.

    4. Government campaigns

&gt;Won't the Internet be useful in governing? Internet addicts clamor for government reports. But when Andy Spano ran for county executive in Westchester County, N.Y., he put every press release and position paper onto a bulletin board. In that affluent county, with plenty of computer companies, how many voters logged in? Fewer than 30. Not a good omen.

[Ron Paul's 2008 campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul_presidential_campaign,_2008#Internet_popularity) proved that the Internet can be a very powerful political weapon. The campaign was driven primarily by a grassroots movement that operated through newly established social media channels such as YouTube, MySpace, and Facebook. Though he lost the Republican primary, Paul lives on as an example of what an earnest community can accomplish with the Internet. 

Also, as [this meme](http://i.imgur.com/vihL20G.gif).

    5. Education

&gt;Then there are those pushing computers into schools. We're told that multimedia will make schoolwork easy and fun. Students will happily learn from animated characters while taught by expertly tailored software.Who needs teachers when you've got computer-aided education? Bah. These expensive toys are difficult to use in classrooms and require extensive teacher training. Sure, kids love videogamesbut think of your own experience: can you recall even one educational filmstrip of decades past? I'll bet you remember the two or three great teachers who made a difference in your life.

Google + Wikipedia can teach almost anything to anyone. As far as traditional book learning goes, the [Khan Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy) offers free online school tutorials and reaches 10,000,000 students per month. Sites like [Udacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udacity) and [Coursera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera) offer free, highly-specialized, University level courses taught by world-class experts with active feedback from the teachers through discussion boards for free to anyone with an Internet connection.

The 1995 student may remember Mr. Jones who taught high-school physics, but the 2014 student can remember taking an AI class with [Sebastian Thrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun), the Stanford professor who invented the [Google car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car).

    6. Business

&gt;Then there's cyberbusiness. We're promised instant catalog shoppingjust point and click for great deals. We'll order airline tickets over the network, make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts. Stores will become obselete. So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the Internetwhich there isn'tthe network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism: salespeople.

You can buy nearly any product you want from Amazon and eBay. You can order anything from airline tickets, to hotel rooms, to food delivery from specialized websites that aggregate prices and automate coupons. [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/01/01/the-coming-death-of-the-american-shopping-mall/) recently ran an article about the shopping mall's impending death (I found the article by typing ""Internet vs mall"" into Google and read the article online for free).

Credit card information is sent over secure channels across the Internet every day. Services like [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) allow a layer of abstraction between payments and bank accounts. Digital currency systems like [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) are gaining popularity and attracting users.

    7. Virtual space

&gt;What's missing from this electronic wonderland? Human contact. Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends over coffee. No interactive multimedia display comes close to the excitement of a live concert. And who'd prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality where frustration is legion and wherein the holy names of Education and Progressimportant aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued.

Already, we are shying away from direct contact with others at every opportunity. [We prefer texting to calling](http://techland.time.com/2012/08/16/we-never-talk-anymore-the-problem-with-text-messaging/), [stare at our iPhones during concerts](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-10-most-annoying-concert-behaviors-20130114), and the Internet has made [porn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_pornography) ubiquitous.

Furthermore, the next generation of technology is aimed to blur the line between physical and cyber spaces. [Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass) places the Internet's information perpetually in the visual field of its users. The [Oculus Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift) is taking life-like virtual reality out of the realm of science fiction and placing it onto the market. The [Omni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuix_Omni) allows users to navigate an immersive 3D environment using their legs.

I am, in fact, someone who got a ""C"" in business law in his undergraduate years.  I have only the thinnest grasp on the law, so I'm excited to hear some opinions.

Common Law, as I understand it, is one way that US courts make decisions.  Common Law basically states that if older court cases are similar to your court case, then you can expect similar judgements to those precious cases.  Common Law is paired with Written Law (constitution, traffic laws, anything written down) to make up the American legal system.  As I understand it, Common Law has been used for hundreds of years and is the standard practice for lawyers across the globe.

Now I suppose for murders, car accidents, and burglary, Common Law is still a pretty good system. However, as we look to the future, (or even the present on occasion) when every case could be riddled with cyber issues, surveillance, personal augmentation, highly complex drugs, etc., will Common Law still work?

We see if today with media cases a lot- the internet is the new medium, but many of the old rulings from the newspaper days are affecting decisions.  Communications rulings, retail rulings, and privacy rulings all seem to be stuck in the past.  Granted, some of these rulings are based on written laws, but I'm concerned about the growth of Common Law rulings that will continue to be applied to these cases, even if they don't really make sense!

What do you guys think- should Common Law go the way of the newspaper and phone booth?  What systems could replace it?",0,0

I think that this applies to technology as well.

It took about a century after that for anyone to build a general purpose computer. So it's not true that technologies are inevitable, even significant ones (or rather the year they are invented can vary by a lot from random, unpredictable factors.)

You can also look at mathematics or science where one genius will come along and suddenly make a significant discovery or discoveries that no one else could figure out for years.

What I'm saying is that I'm not sure we can predict the singularity (or other technologies for that matter), with any degree of accuracy. It could happen next year, or it could take a century. Likewise don't be so harsh on people that made failed predictions in the past.",21,12

I really wonder whether the task of sewing a t-shirt,
currently one of the lowest paid, and for a human also relatively simple task, is something that can be easily automated.


The thing is:


Unlike the materials used in other factory processes a piece of cloth is this crumbly, twisty material and to sew a t-shirt out of it, you have to turn it around and straighten it out several times, and I could guess you would need a robot with not only a sophisticated AI,
but also robot arms with a certain finesse to do this.


The importence of this thought lies of course,
that its kind of a counter example to the thought that if we would all get our studying on and join the glorious STEM-masterrace,
all this lowly work would just vanish,
and that it is thus justified to treat these workers like we currently do.


This specific example is of course just one of many,
and even if I'm proven wrong, and there is a simple and efficient way of building such a machine,
one still has to ask what other tasks there are, where human ability still by far surpasses technology, even if those tasks are  for a human are very ""low-skilled"".


Or put another way, if the system works as intended and soon all humans gain the skills to work in high tech, it would also mean that the current comp sci and engineering guys would also have to take up a part of the manual sewing work,
and thus if you are a person who actually *likes* engineering,
you could say that maybe it would be in your interest to set up a system where those jobs are not treated so horrible that everybody has the highest incentative to do something else.

I am a prospective software engineer in my first year of study. I am reading Michio Kaku's book *The Physics of the Future* right now. One of the predictions the book makes is that Moore's Law will end toward the end of this decade or the beginning of the next decade. Michio Kaku thinks that this could turn silicon valley into a rust belt. 

Presently job growth is quite good for software engineers. [Pay increases at a rate of ~6.8% per year.](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/110712-it-salaries-2013-264063.html) Do you think salaries would continue to rise if computing power ceased to increase exponentially? Do you think software engineering would become even more important since algorithmic optimization would be one of the only ways left to improve performance? If hardware sales go down what will that do to software engineering? 

Quantum computing, molecular computing, and 3D circuits are possible but improbably to become realities in the next two decades. 

Quote from the relevant chapter: 

&gt;Two years ago, I keynoted a major conference for Microsoft at their main headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Three thousand of the top engineers at Microsoft were in the audience, waiting to hear what I had to say about the future of computers and telecommunications. Staring out at the huge crowd, I could see the faces of the young, enthusiastic engineers who would be creating the programs that will run the computers sitting on our desks and laps. I was blunt about Moores law, and said that the industry has to prepare for this collapse. A decade earlier, I might have been met with laughter or a few snickers. But this time I only saw people nodding their heads.

I'm posting this here because Michio Kaku is one of the featured futurists of the subreddit. I think we need to consider the economic implications of his prediction. ",13,0

Here's a question I've been mulling over for years.  I think most people on both sides of the political divide will agree that the government does not serve the people, or at least not very well.  From my perspective, the wealthy have far too much influence over our political system, thanks to campaign finance laws that basically amount to legalized bribery.  My question is, how is technology going to change that?  How is technology going to re-democratize America and give the power back to the people.  I'm confident technology will eventually have a positive and irreversible impact on our political system; I just don't see how it's going to happen.  

I would like to avoid turning this into a political debate.  I want to focus on technology and its impact on politics; not just in the U.S., but around the world.  I'm primarily concerned with fixing the system here in the U.S., but I'm sure any technology that changes OUR system will change others as well.

You bet that in future your problems will be solved by technology that does not yet exist. When the singularity comes you receive your winnings in the form of basic income, advanced technology including AI, immortality from transhumanist life extension technologies, or some other fanciful futuristic benefit. I know you think this way because I have read this subreddit for months. 

This is disasterous thinking. Imagine if someone told you they were going to live above their means because they were certain they were going to win the lottery in 10 years. Imagine that they had wonderful charts, graphs, and books describing how they were more or less guaranteed to win the lottery within a certain time frame. This person, in anticipation of their future wealth, would go on a spending spree and put themselves deeply into debt while banking on their future wealth, which would of course never materialize. 

The best thing to do with singulitarian hypotheses is ignore them. It is kind of like the inverse of Pascal's wager. Let's call it **Stringman's wager**. Let's assume that the singulitarians are wrong on all counts for the 21st century. You don't get basic income, a house robot, a human level AI, biological enhancements, super longevity or any other futuristic bonuses. Unfortunately, since you believed in the singularity you didn't save for retirement or plan for your eventual, inevitable demise with a decent life insurance policy. So, at the end of your life your transhumanist, singulitarian **faith** has robbed you and your family of financial security. Contrast this with someone who knows nothing of the singularity or does not believe anything about singulitarian claims. There is no penalty if they turn out to be wrong. They just get to enjoy the benefits of future technology while being financially secure. Ironically, the people who are best suited to enjoy a *possible* singularity are those who know nothing about singulitarianism. ",85,0

I've read all his other books as well, starting with *Daemon*. His novels cover future-tech ideas from automated vehicles to holograms suspended in air to post-human intelligence AI, but the common thread with the tech he introduces in his novels is that, I can imagine how it could be possible. In some instances, he even discusses the technology and how it works, in detail. It's still Sci-Fi, so I take it all with a grain of salt, but it's refreshing to read about future tech in Sci-Fi and then read online where some company is working to make it actually happen.

I contacted him about some of my own work on healthy development and consciousness (see my website [TheWiseTurtle.com](http://www.thewiseturtle.com/) for more details), and also asked him if there were places where I could get involved with helping make this kind of healthy AI development happen.  He suggested a few top-down type places (institutions and corporations and such, like the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk) which don't seem to want help from just any old thoughtful person.  He also said that there were some Facebook and other communities, but didn't mention what they were.  So, I'm wondering if you folks know of anything.

That much is obvious. Since our days of living in caves, we've always had a survival instinct. That creeping shadow outside could be a dangerous predator. Such instincts have stayed with us all this time.

My question is how will horror and fear manifest in the future. Personally, I believe that until humans are purely logical beings without emotion (something that could be a hundred to thousands of years away.), we will always be afraid of something. How will technology change this fear.

Old horror movies and books could easily be averted if the protagonist  uses a cell phone. Then cell phones mysteriously stop working. If you go on /r/nosleep you'll find a lot of modern horror where the supernatural manage to circumvent technology. Mysterious Skype calls with no caller. Creepy faces on a computer monitor. cellphone apps with bloody images. In many cases ghosts manage to not show up on cameras or webcams.

How will new technology affect this? Would we feel safer or would we have creatures simply circumvent these too.

Personal robots suddenly hacking you to death in the dead of night? Smart homes trying to kill their occupants. Mysterious phantoms haunting you without showing up on your AR contact lenses memory banks.

Even better, how would people in space handle horror. They would be working or living in what amounts to be a desolate wasteland or void without many other humans (initially). Would that shadow off the crater actually become a spirit? Would you be chased around by a monster on a derelict mining ship that's losing power? Would the abandoned asteroid base suddenly be home to a deranged psychopath and his murder victims? Would unspeakable nightmares traverse the void, ready to tear the minds of those who view them?

Any viewponts on how we handle fear and horror in the future would be nice?",2,9

It strikes me as a generally techno-optimistic book so far. 

&gt;**Thinking Machines, Available Now** 

&gt;Machines that can complete cognitive tasks are even more important than machines that can accomplish physical ones. And thanks to modern AI we now have them. Our digital machines have escaped their narrow confines and started to demonstrate broad abilities in pattern recognition, complex communication, and other domains that used to be exclusively human.

&gt;Brynjolfsson, Erik; McAfee, Andrew (2014-01-20T00:00:00+00:00). The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (Kindle Locations 1253-1256). W. W. Norton &amp; Company. Kindle Edition. 

The chapter goes on to say that AI will augment all of our working lives soon and change the way we socially interact. 

Contrast this with AI pessimists like Noam Chomsky:

&gt;""[I]f you want to study, say, the neurology of an ant, you ask what does the ant do? It turns out the ants do pretty complicated things, like path integration, for example. If you look at bees, bee navigation involves quite complicated computations, involving position of the sun, and so on and so forth. But in general what he argues is that if you take a look at animal cognition, human too, it's computational systems. Therefore, you want to look the units of computation. Think about a Turing machine, say, which is the simplest form of computation, you have to find units that have properties like ""read"", ""write"" and ""address."" That's the minimal computational unit, so you got to look in the brain for those. You're never going to find them if you look for strengthening of synaptic connections or field properties, and so on. You've got to start by looking for what's there and what's working...""

He thinks general AI is a long way away and that we might have the wrong approach. 

How is there so much disagreement in a field that is so old? AI research has been going on since the 1950s, yet there are still serious academics with huge doubts and others with high hopes. There isn't nearly this much diversity of opinion in other old fields like nuclear power. 

Ben Goertzel, a self described 'hard core singulitarian' had this to say about the future of AI when asked the following question:""What is the biggest or most fundamental benefit you see AI progress and research delivering to Humanity as a whole over the next 20 years?""

&gt;That is hard to predict. I think AGI could vastly accelerate research on ending death and disease. An AGI scientist could also probably massively accelerate our quest for cheap energy, which would make a big difference. Also, AGIs could potentially get Drexlerian nanotech to work. Basically, I suppose I fall into the camp that: Once human-level AGI is created, we'll fairly suddenly have a large number of very smart AGi scientists and engineers around, and a LOT of different innovations are going to happen during a somewhat brief time interval. Exactly what order these innovations will come in, is not possible to foresee now...

So you see, there is lots of conflicting information out there and it's really hard to make an estimate of how useful AI or AGI is going to be this century.

Have you got any better information? 

Here's one meta-prediction by Bill Gates: 

&gt;""Ray Kurzweil is the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence. His intriguing new book envisions a future in which information technologies have advanced so far and fast that they enable humanity to transcend its biological limitations-transforming our lives in ways we can't yet imagine.""
-Bill Gates 

Another by Michio Kaku that captures my main point quite well. 

&gt;""Not surprisingly, although the media hyped some of the more sensational predictions made at the Asilomar conference, most of the working scientists doing the day-to-day research in artificial intelligence were much more reserved and cautious. When asked when the machines will become as smart as us, the scientists had a surprising variety of answers, ranging from 20 to 1,000 years."" Michio Kaku in *The Physics of the Future*",17,11

The human brain does an estimated 1exaflops/sec computations. meaning 1,000,000 tera flops. 

You can rent a GPU on the cloud from amazon that offers 2.3 teraflops/sec for 0.65/hour. This means renting so0mething with the capacity of the brain costs $325K per hour. 

And with the new of way of doing calculations more efficiently by 100x posted here a while ago, it comes down to $3250 per hour, which should make the hardware available for many research groups and start ups. 

That , with the fact that most likely we don't need that much hardware , means that hardware will stop being a limit(which is good since moore's law is stopping). It would be all about the software.

The futurology subreddit has given me a lot of hope and excitement. I think futurology is probably my biggest interest right now and in terms of career I'd love to do something that contributed towards it some how although I know it's probably hard to get in to. Some of my interests are:

- The advancement of travel/vehicles. i.e: nasa, spacex, the hyperloop, google self-driving cars
- The preservation of youth/increasing life expectancy
- Computer science/AI

Some things I've been doing are learning to program in my spare time for a while and looking at the possibility of doing a mechanical engineering degree which would cover the first interest I'm guessing. What careers would you recommend for each of the induvidual interests?

793,2014-2-26,2014,2,26,7,1yxhqs,A clarification on Moore's Law,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1yxhqs/a_clarification_on_moores_law/,[deleted],1393365606,"Many people in this subreddit use the phrase ""Moore's Law"" to refer to exponential growth in computing power per constant dollar across time. This is not what Moore's Law is. Gordon Moore was referring to integrated circuits only when he observed and predicted that the number of transistors would double every 18 to 24 months. 

Here is a Wikipedia excerpt that explains the confusion:

&gt;He [Kurzweil] believes that the exponential growth of Moore's law will continue beyond the use of integrated circuits into technologies that will lead to the technological singularity. The Law of Accelerating Returns described by Ray Kurzweil has in many ways altered the public's perception of Moore's law. It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology, when it was originally intended to apply only to semiconductor circuits. Many futurists still use the term ""Moore's law"" in this broader sense to describe ideas like those put forth by Kurzweil. Kurzweil has hypothesised that Moore's law will apply  at least by inference  to any problem that can be attacked by digital computers as is in its essence also a digital problem. Therefore, because of the digital coding of DNA, progress in genetics may also advance at a Moore's law rate. Moore himself, who never intended his law to be interpreted so broadly, has quipped:

&gt;   Moore's law has been the name given to everything that changes exponentially. I say, if Gore invented the Internet,[note 3] I invented the exponential.[76]

&gt;[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#Futurists_and_Moore.27s_law)


Moore's Law and Kurzweil's ideas have been mashed together and now create confusion for people who think that the end of Moore's Law may mean the end of exponential growth in computing, which it may, but only because of a lack of alternative architecture. Moore's law is set to end no matter what happens since the physical limit of silicon transistors is 5 nm; we are currently at 14 nm.

It would be a perfect way to grow a lot of fruits and vegetables in a controlled environment without the need for pesticides or even a lot of land. The only real problem is maintaining the growth substrate and growing conditions. But I suppose it would be possible to regulate heat by making use of uptransfer, basically use lower levels for lower heat and higher for higher heat as the heat from the lower levels rises up.

[Dollhouse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135300/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_10) is based on the idea of erasing and imprinting information on brains. The operation center is named the Dollhouse, and is where all the 'dolls' live between job assignments. The dolls are hired by the rich to do any job imaginable; dominatrix, assassin, or nuclear physicist, anything copied from true professionals. For the sake of a TV plot there has to be a few holes in the technology, but by the end, you'll have seen the major possibilities and issues that this technology could develop.  
[Joss Whedon](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/) is the creator and/or director of Dollhouse, The Avengers, Firefly, Serenity, Angel, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

The ""cities of the future"" seem to be giant skyscrapers of metal and glass that extend to the far reaches of the atmosphere. The most troubling is the lack of any human scale to the cities. They are monolithic and don't feature anything a real human today (or throughout our thousands of years of human history) would ever care to traverse. One of the few cities of tomorrow that were ever built was Brasilia, which is a total failure. 

One of the *truly* interesting depictions of our future cities comes from a Japanese artist by the name of Imperial Boy (). His artwork captures the human scale but built up. 

Anyone else's thoughts on why the depictions of future cities are probably nothing like how our cities are going to be built in the next few centuries? ",20,10

You have all of the average amenities of the day but are a somewhat more highly educated community than average with a broad range of expertise.

One day in the blink of an eye there is no other human on the face of the planet. Your 30,000 are it. You also discover it's as if humanity was never there to begin with. All natural resources are untouched outside of the borders of your small city.

Let's say you were about 70% capable of subsisting without external imports for the basics like food, water, and power to begin with. You're not going to die en mass now that you're alone, but it's not going to be comfortable.

How would you start over again? 

I ask this because I'm reading Eric Flint's 1632 series and it made me wonder. Just how well would a city 30 years in the future survive? One built on higher order technology which required a global supply chain to maintain, and one built by people who did not grow up as independent as the characters in that series did?

Let's assume that we're not concerned that scarcity is good for business since business is just a means to an end, and a means that many hope to replace in the future.

I've come up with a few items that I think might be a negative consequence (although I recognize that some of them may be things that we want):

1. Either Socrates or Plato-quoting-Socrates stated that the technology of writing reduced the human capacity for memory, and therefore caused humans to be less wise because understanding something is to remember something about it. So the more technology we depend on, including abundance dependent technology, the less we are required to know about things. The counterpoint to that is that we can specialize more by emptying our minds of things we don't need to know in order to survive. This is already something we do to some extent. Another one is that human minds may become augmented at some point in the future anyway.

2. If we have an abundance of anything, we are more likely to appreciate it less. We may place less meaning on things that we have previously been grateful for. I think there's wisdom in not taking things for granted. 

3. WALL-E type human lethargy. Fat bodies (could be genetically reversed, or mechanized, or digitized), always plugged into a network (we're all on Reddit already, we might even desire this), child-like innocence (is it better to be wise from struggling, or naive from contentedness?)

4. Human innovation and efficiency. If all of our needs are met people may become less inclined to seek a better way to do something. Counterpoints: machines could do this for us, and abundance is often the result of efficiency so some measured efficiency would already exist.

Is there anything you can think of that could be added to this list? Even if you have a valid counterpoint. I know Futurology is supposed to be about solving all of the world's problems, but I've only found things that I would consider to be relatively minor problems, if they would be problems at all.

I suppose from a Futurologist perspective we could think of this as a list of things to be aware of that we should solve while bringing about abundance.",22,12

So here is my theory, I don't know if it is that original but I haven't seen it anywhere else:

The Internet of things will be Web 3.0
By ""Internet of things"" I mean the connection of everyday items like cars, watches, TVs, kitchen equipment but also innovative gadgets such as centralized controls for your home electronics (e.g. Nest), sensors in garbage cans, streets and everything else.

Let me explain further:
Web 1.0 were static Websites that anybody could host.
Web 2.0 are dynamic Websites with usergenerated content.
Web 3.0 will be the conquest of the physical world by the internet. 

Advanced sensors in portable devices (Smartwatches, Fitness wristbands, Smartphones), big data analyzation, visualization of everyday life statistics, downsizing all the electronics, ...
Google, Apple, Samsung, Sony, Fitbit, and so forth, every big hardware manufacturer is working on something that will manifest the internet in a more physical form than the average PC, Laptop or iPad.

Smartphones were a big leap in this direction but if you take a step back and look at them, they are very bulky, abstract and unnatural devices for all the purposes they have inherited. A Phone is not the correct devices to be fitness companion, communication and media consumption device in one.

Every current upcoming trend points in this direction. It will be a huge revolution of our lives. As their manufacturing costs decrease (rapidly I think) sensors will be everywhere in every device. Services like Google Now will analyze the huge amounts of personal data and use them in a useful way. Your car will tell your home control when you`ll come home, so your lights turn on by themselves. Your wristband/smartwatch will monitor heartrate and bloodpressure, it will tell you when you should see a doctor. Google and Apple are already patenting and researching sensors and algorithms which do this.

Everything will be connected.

It will be awesome and terrifying.

At least this is what I think will happen. What is your opinion?",17,24
