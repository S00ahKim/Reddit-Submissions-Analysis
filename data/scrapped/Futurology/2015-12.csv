Sure, at the moment the flavor is lacking compared to livestock meat, because the tech isn't quite there yet. It is also expensive, but it won't be forever. Eventually, it will become much cheaper, just because it takes fewer resources to grow the meat without the animal. When it's exactly the same or even better than meat right now, how can you call it ""fake"". It's made of the same thing, but produced in a way that is much more efficient and doesn't even involve slaughter. Farms (factories?) would have absolute control of flavor, texture, literally everything. They would have it growing in a tube. ",12,2

The whole thing was about virtual reality, where in that person's response, someone experienced a whole life time (I think 40-50 years) in the span of two hours.

And that got me thinking: Would there ever be a virtual reality machine system so complex and so advanced, that it would literally ""slow down"" the real world to the point where we could live essentially centuries if we wanted in the time span of only a few hours?

For example, our brains would process it as happening in ""real-time,"" but in reality, a person watching someone in this machine would really see the simulation zip by years every few minutes.

Would something like that ever be possible?",35,13

I try to stay mostly up to date in world relations. It's not something I dedicate mass amounts of time to but a pretty significant amount of time is put into it when I do. So now even seeing the things I see, reading religious texts, listening to conspiracies, just taking in everything that I can see happening. All the stories from different sources so as not to get too biased of a view... and even if I was the one who discovered and pin pointed the time and date, what would I do? So my opinion that follows is what if all the crazy shit that's happening while we're on this planet in our time.. is just our version of the end.. I'm sure throughout history... all sorts of bullshit happened and people thought it was the end or their day..  but all our days come to an end. . No matter what. . It's no ploy of god, it's humanities way of coping with the chaos of the universe, but I'm sure that's been thought of before. But like I think we're just spending our time, playing around on this giant playground we were fortunate enough to evolve on, into this beautifully destructive species that refuses to leave questions unanswered and boundaries unpushed. Now that being said.. do you think it matters whether I spend my life, chillin doing basic work and just paying for my normal stuff and drugs and fading into existence.  Or push to make a mark on reality that could quite possibly be the reason we continue on as a species.. or last go out with a bang like our great ancestors before, beyond the life, when we were still stars, exploding in a blaze and fury spreading the elements across the vacuum so that new life may move forward, like when trees die and are decomposed and redistributed to who ever needs it. I think God pulls us to the spiritual side of reality. But there's no use in stressing unless you want to.. I just had to rant ",8,0

We recently [announced](http://www.sentient.ai/news/shoes-com-sentient-technologies-unveil-visual-filter-the-worlds-first-ai-shopping-experience/) with Shoes.com a new way to shop for shoes utilizing visual intelligence. The [Shoeme.ca](http://www.shoeme.ca/collections/womens-boots) solution leverages (Sentient Aware for e-Commerce)[http://www.sentient.ai/aware/] to provide retailers and shoppers a way to find the products they love. For a detailed look at how the AI-powered retail platform works, see my blog on the technology [here](http://www.sentient.ai/creating-sentient-aware-for-e-commerce/).

Im here for the next 90 minutes to answer your questions on AI! Ask me anything!

So ten years? Probably not. Even if we do what the guy is talking about it isn't likely, but he has a point. Governments are spending virtually nothing on advancing AI research (DARPA in the US being the only real contender in the public sector) and that is *absurd*. 

But they aren't the only ones with money to throw around. I just saw a headline in /r/worldnews about Zuckerberg donating $45 billion to charity, Gates spends billions on charity while he's alive with a plan to donate anything that's left in his will. We have philanthropist billionaires by the fistful donating massive amounts of money to charity---which is absolutely a noble thing to do! But the development of safe AGI would end all of the world's current problems in a short period of time. Yeah, it's probably further away than 10 years even with huge amounts of money and manpower invested, but it is the last thing we ever have to invent. It just seems absurd for the developed world to spend trillions of dollars every year on charity without spending even ten billion a year on AGI research (and the only ones who are, large tech firms, are looking more towards near-term narrow AI development which probably isn't the most efficient possible route to AGI). 

It is infuriating how little press the concept gets. It is infuriating how few resources we are putting into the most significant development *we are capable of as a species.* 

Tell your friends. This issue needs attention---more so than virtually any other. The development of safe AGI is the most important thing we can be thinking of and society at large isn't thinking about it at all. ",30,5

Before that there was Napoleon vs the Duke of Wellington.

Napoleon called himself Emperor but all of Europe's rich and famous called him an usurper and a Corscian corporal. Duke of Wellington was recognized by everyone in Europe as a Duke.

The Duke of Wellington still exists. The house of Bonaparte is no more, although Napoleon's line does survive thru his illegit son Waleski (who was proven to be Nap's son in a genetic test recently).

All the technological advances have not changed social structure too much. After all is said and done, those who control the law and politics and media, etc, win in the end, before the techies.

In his immortal book ""Class"", Paul Fussell describes various classes of America, which supposedly do not have an 'aristocratic' class. The Top-out-of-sight, about whom not much is known since they prefer to not reveal their true identity to the public and would rather only associate with themselves, is the iron class which controls basically everything.

Rentiers have been always at the top of everything historically.

No matter how much tech might evolve, people still need a place to sleep in, which means the rentiers will always make money in a high-tech world.

in an Abundance world, people who could pay $10,000/mo rent will be pushed over by people who could pay, say, $25,000/mo rent. No matter how much abundance one might have in the world, since the amount of 'prime' space is limited, the rentiers win. 

All the tech progress in the last 400 years did not weaken the upper or top-out-of-sight class too much.

Some people make lots of money. However, as time goes on, it is always the toos or upper class who has the last laugh, as the wealth of these parvenus are eventually added to the ranks of these high-class people by marriage or other means.

All social systems are designed to prevent radical changes which might harm those who designed it. High-tech and singularity are not likely to upset the 'Darjeeling Cart', simply because class trumps everything and it has trumped every new tech ever designed.

-----

Social structure and class have proven to be far more enduring than anyone could have thought.

The slots for the world's most prestigious universities are very limited, and the legacy admissions sometimes do make very big (i.e. George W Bush)

They are still going to become world leaders or be placed in important positions of society, strong enough to stymie tech advances as it has happened in many instances (i.e. Edison vs Tesla)

I don't see the class system upset by tech advances. There will be enough people believing in class systems, no matter how much tech could evolve.",41,9

1. SpaceX will land and refly a rocket first stage. 
2. The Chinese will use Crisper to modify a viable human embryo. (But they will not implant it). 
3. 2016 will known as the year of VR. With oculus, vive, gear VR, etc sales reaching one billion dollars.
4. Human full genome sequencing will be offered to regular consumers for $1000 or less. 
5. 2016 will be the start of 4K gaming with Nvidia Pascal leading us into a glorious gaming future. 

There will be many more improvements to AI, robitics, autonomous cars, but nothing too ground breaking.

I thought I might just make a brief post about it here. 

I've been seeing a lot of people saying things like the following in regards to futurism in employment/worth:

* 30 year old - ""Soon, getting a CS degree will be more like an apprenticeship akin to plumbing or being an electrician. This will perhaps be in my lifetime.""

* ""The future is STEM. People should migrate to those degrees and opportunities because that's where the jobs will be for a long, long time.""

* ""Don't study _______, study ________ instead because in 35 years you'll still have a job.""



These conventional (and quite obvious, hardly futurist) views frustrate me somewhat. They assume that there isn't going to be an abundance of software, an abundance of machine learning, an abundance of computers getting smarter, etc. Humans stagnate, but computers only get smarter... A computer **never** regresses. As a result, these ideas of humans programming computers for 35 years is in my opinion, nonsensical. With current trends in machine learning and computer programming (which will be done by computers themselves), there's only so much time that humans have left being useful.

We can already see this devaluation of human capital in other industries. Take the forex market for example; hedge funds like BlueCrest are [getting rid of their investor based models](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/115504dc-982a-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html) because they have been having a hard time turning a profit recently. This isn't because of a recession or a weak economic period, in fact, quite the opposite. It's because there is a saturation of traders that are good; there are no more white nights in the industry who have more knowledge because they've been there for 30 years and went to get a Cambridge physics degree. Any old Schmuck can be just as good as them at trading. As a result, it hasn't been profitable to keep so few of the profits from investor cash, and that's why they need to use personal funds to take 100% of the winnings. Trading robots also are getting better than humans...


Conventional banking and finance is **definitely** on the fall... This has been predicted for 4-5 years now, yet many still haven't caught on. Trading robots will do it better than humans do (very soon, 5 years maybe), and it also requires less processing in the system to be a trader.

The same is true for programming and CS for me. As computers will soon be able to do it themselves, there will be less need (and eventually no need) for human capital in those markets. 


___________________________________

Will there be unemployment? Yeah. Will conventional university degrees, especially for STEM, become obsolete? I think so. 

These aren't problems though. They're only problems if we run the world with the same conventional system that we have for decades now. Something new will come about, and that's an exciting prospect. Labour, employment, worth, human capital/value, education, skill, and wisdom will all change greatly and/or be eliminated.

A refusal to think freely is making universities increasingly irrelevant. He makes a strong case.

The arts (sociology, etc) have been hijacked by the left and have been turned into a bland PC porridge of nanny-centric centres of indoctrination (Im looking at America as well). To create safe spaces for university students. Fuck that! University students are supposed to be in the vanguard of progressive thinking with a nervous establishment reining them in. They are future leaders and the only downside is their youth and lack of experience (nothing wrong with their thinking). Now radicalism is having a poster of Che Guevara on your wall and left posturing in the local coffee shop. Thats not radical any longer, thats mainstream. Graduates are left-leaning and perpetuate the nanny ethos when they become leaders.

This relates to futurology in that the technical innovation route is progressing but the evolution of society is static  this is where sociology is important. If society does not evolve solutions to cope with coming changes (unemployment, etc) they are going to see their arse big time. An ill informed society hinders innovation and cannot cope when it happens. Sociology, as a discipline, needs to have the easy option stigma removed and some serious talent need to become sociologists and work on the, long neglected, evolution of society.

More seriously, a general trend I've noticed, especially over the past few decades, is an emphasis on sparseness and minimalism, sleekness, and there being a lot of light. This is shown in a variety of films such as Minority Report, AI, Cloud Atlas, etc. (I know there are exceptions, especially if the future is portrayed as post-apocalyptic). 

Is this just a reflection of current trends, mirroring say, the glassy sterile-looking skyscrapers making up most modern skylines? Or is there a real trend towards more light and less baroque detailing, which has arguably been the case since the last turn of the century?

Will the technological needs and demands of the future necessitate certain aesthetic constraints, especially in architecture and design?",10,5

Will waste be used for something more constructive in the future? Will our waste be used for fertilization and/or other things? I'll admit I haven't given it much thought, but the more I think about it the more difficult I find it to think of drastic changes.

This has been evident from the begging of technology.  The hammer can build or destroy.  Once more technologies become more accessible to people, the possibility for devastation gets bigger. Knives guns bombs chemical/bio weapons. But what will we do when the technology to hurt others will be more and more accessible to everyone? There are a lot of smart people predicting that we will have our own nano-scale factories that can produce macro scale objects on our desktops at home. You already can print a 3d gun at home if you have the right blueprints. (google liberator gun) And worse yet, some people predict we'll be able to cheaply and easily engineer viruses using CRISPR and other genetic manipulation technologies. I think we'll come to the realization that we will no longer be able to control evil peoples ability to harm others simply by using regulation. And the stakes are only going to get bigger.
With the internet of everything, mass camera reinsurance and more and more available data, would it be possible to monitor all of it with a kind of AI that is not accessible to humans outright.  Once a threat is realized the likelihood of a serious crime and all the data could be given to law enforcement.  But it can't be trolled for data by government for nefarious purposes.

You want to order a pizza, so you say to your flat screen, ""TV, go to dominos.com."" It pulls it up, you ask for a large bacon and pineapple with a 2 liter of coke. They make it, then a drone flies it from your local shoppe to your landing pad. The pad is on the roof of your house, or in a depository in your apartment that attaches to a dumbwaiter-type device. Once the drone makes the drop, your TV/phone is alerted. You get your pie and eat. 

Oh wait, I want to order a new shirt. You say to the flat screen, ""TV, go to [Lion &amp; Wolf](http://lionandwolf.bigcartel.com)."" You order a sweet tee. At a big warehouse 50 miles away, an automated picker takes your order, finds the slot, pulls the item, and an automated truck goes to your local hub. Then again a drone drops your package off to your spot. 

Life is short. You just got your taxes back, and mama needs a new king size bed. Go to IKEA, or whatever, and select beds. Wearing your Google Glass, you choose a victorian poster bed and in virtual mode, you can see if the bed is a good fit for your new hipster room.

Also, when you go to CNN for the news, it just starts up live feed (like old-school TV), but you can also tell your flat screen to do all sorts of other things at the same time, browse new editorials at the site, blog your ass off, all while the show is off in the corner, you see your alerts for shopping pop up like a notification on your phone. When you go off to get the pizza, your son pops his phone up on the big screen and starts playing Digimon episodes. Wife calls, tells the son to sit the hell down, and here's you eating a giant pizza pie all by yourself (what would the doctors say?).

Fun stuff. Your thoughts?",11,8

When talking about the future of transportation, there seems to be a huge divide between car manufacturers and the people, but nobody seems to ever point it out. Car manufacturers think that the future for them is to transition from offering cars to individuals, they have no choice as sale numbers plummet, and offer instead the service of transportation. 

However, what they intend to do is nothing other then trying to reinvent public transportation while keeping it forever private, less efficient, more energy intensive, more damaging to the environment and thus, in the long run more costly. It would be one thing to cover the needs of transportation through a fleet of cars and another with a far smaller number of buses, trains, trams etc.

Basically, when thinking of the future of transportation, most futurists seem to have drunk the kool aid of the car manufacturers and now share and champion their vision of shining 8 lane highways with self driving electric cars clogging them 24/7/365 running bumper to bumper.

We have had the solution in the form of trams or trains for more than a century. Nobody seems to want to look back and consider the better alternative for the average person.

Well, at least this is my opinion. What do people around here think about the matter?",23,15

* Late 2020s: First sexbots that resemble real humans appear (they will be a separate 'line' than the more dollish ones). They are still limited and can only do sex functions and some basic conversation, for the most part. 

* 2030s: Robots become more multi-functional, and are able to clean themselves and do basic household tasks. 

* Late 2030s/early 2040s: Sex robots get close to becoming human replacements, as they are able to maintain themselves, converse like a human, and do 'wife' tasks like cooking, cleaning, and maybe even shopping. ",7,0
384,2015-12-6,2015,12,6,8,3vlfzt,Why I believe that transfer of identity (mind uploading) would work.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3vlfzt/why_i_believe_that_transfer_of_identity_mind/,Barzahl123,1449356852,"But it is not enough for survival.

So the assumptions of people who believe that mind uploading would work are.

1:The identity of an entity is not the sum of it's parts but the system of relations between those parts.

2:it is possible to recreate this system precisely on another substrate.

Conclusion:Because of 2,It is possible to ""transfer"" the identity of a person into a different substrate.

You can either choose gradual replacement,scanning or replacing huge chunks at a time.All of these methods are based on the above assumptions.


In order to resist the main argument for mind uploading you need to challenge one or more of these assumptions.

Usually the debates about mind uploading involving denying the first premise or denying the second.More often the disputes are about the consequences of the argument.But people who dispute the consequences of the argument end up having to confront one of the premises.They might have to deny the claim that the identity of an entity is the system of relations between it's parts or deny the claim that it is even possible to replicate the system of relations.


What happens in cases where I am still alive and the ""copy"" is standing across the room? Clearly I am not the copy,and clearly the copy is not me.

Some people would argue that the copy and you both have an equal claim to being the original.This means that there is nothing special about your brain that makes it necessary for you to be the one and the only special one.

You will both believe your memories are real and neither of you will have any way of knowing if they are real beyond pieces of evidence scattered across the world.You will have the same status as your ""copy"".

If we stick with the above assumptions,you will have transferred your identity into the copy,even if you did not transfer your consciousness.Some people do not accept the idea that the consciousness isn't the identity.But the argument can be deduced to this.It wouldn't be transferral of consciousness,but transferral of identity.

This might be enough to put some people off the concept of mind uploading,because it doesn't do what they want it to do for them,and what good is a technology that doesn't work as intended?

People care about their own survival.If you are standing across the room from your ""copy"",it is true that you will both have the same identity(if you accept the above assumptions).But it is also true that you will both be concerned with your own survival,and mind cloning will not directly contribute to your survival(by making you immortal).So what's the point?

Anyway,so transfer of identity does not entail transfer of consciousness.Consciousness is not identity.An entity may or may not have consciousness,non-conscious entities can exist.

In this case the idea that an entity **is** a sum of it's parts has equal strength.Your having an identity is not dependant on your having experiences.Thus you can be dead and still have an identity.Even when you are not experiencing existence,you may still exist.

Many things exist which do not have experiences. Cryogenically frozen people,people in a coma,people who are asleep,rocks etc



Of course at the end of the day is the question of survival.You have this strong sense that you are a being that has survived for many years.But what evidence do you have to support the claim that you have existed for more than a few seconds? All the experiences you are having are consistent with the claim that you came into being seconds ago,and you will disappear a few seconds from now.The only thing holding these experiences together is the sense of self,autonoetic awareness.But what you are compelled to believe about your identity from moment to moment doesn't tell us much about the facts.Survival is the real issue.",20,0

Things like Prime Air are a warning sign that robots are going to make us turn out like ""Wall-E""; why not use robots to keep us healthy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3vn6od/modern_innovation_is_removing_the_need_for/,ViceAdmiralVidya,1449392806,"Think about it. 20-30 years from now, there are going to be very, very few reason to actually leave the house. For some, working at home will just be the norm. With the advent of Amazon's Prime Air, pretty soon people will be using the system just to get snacks. There may come a time when in-house drones or other robots remove the need to even get out of bed. 

That scares me a bit. But I'm not gonna blame the robots, it's not their fault. It's ours. It's just human nature. 

But, biologically, we NEED hard work. Our muscles must strain and stretch, our lungs must swell and our heart must beat. Without hard work, we will atrophy and die. 

But we don't have to.

Thanks to ""smart home"" tech, our entire houses are becoming connected in ways that we never could have imagined a few decades ago. We need to use this technology for our health.

When our will fails us, the unwavering focus and determination a machine can take up the slack, and crack the whip to get us moving.

Let me see if I can make a clear example.

With a ""smart"", integrated kitchen (pantry, cabinets, microwave, oven, fridge and more), my daily calorie intake is measured. A device on my wrist or neck measures my biometrics. 

Now, it's near the end of the day and I've eaten my daily calorie intake. But I'm still a bit hungry. I go to open the freezer to get some ice cream...

But it won't budge. It's locked. The house knows that if I consume any more, it will be converted to fat. 

See, I neglected to do my daily workout routine that day. 

If I want that ice cream, I can work out to get some. Once I complete my routine ( which it monitors through some sensors in the house and in my wristband) it unlocks the freezer and lets me at that mint-chocolate goodness.

But, I need a bowl. If I try to eat it right out of the container, the house will see. If I want, I can eat that entire gallon of ice cream right there. But the house will know that I seriously overate.

If that happens, my workout routine is intensified to help compensate until I've worked it all off.

If I try to walk out of the kitchen with the thing, the doors will not open. I'm not that sneaky.

So, I go to the cabinet to get a bowl. A small bowl is dispensed. If I want a larger one, I can do a workout now, or opt to intensify my regular routine. 

I settle for the smaller bowl. Once I've cleaned up and the ice cream is returned to the freezer, the doors to the kitchen unlock, and I am free to take my bowl of mint chocolate chip to my room. 



That was a bit lengthy, but I hope I got the point across.  Obviously, the system doesn't have to be so heavy handed all the time. Let's say it can be set to simply suggest and gently guide me, or we can set it to total lockdown, since my willpower regarding ice cream does not favor my health. 

Alternatively, you can set it to scale; start off soft, and if you remain complacent and lazy, it gets harder on you. The better you can operate on your own, the less the house will ""force"" upon  you. 

Should an emergency occur, the house will fully unlock to avoid worsening a situation. In fact, should the house detect you are injured, seriously ill or worse, dying, it can automatically contact emergency personnel and lock all the doors that would lead away from your position, so that said personnel can reach you faster. 

Someone breaks into your home? Woop woop, lockdown time! Once the house detects where the intruder is, doors are locked to prevent them from getting any farther and police are notified. 



These technologies have a great many possible uses to keep us healthy. Now, to some, my proposal is alarming.

""Sensors and cameras all up in my house? M-muh NSA!"" 

To be frank, the NSA will be able to monitor you no matter what, unless you decide to go Survivorman. There are most definitely some potential drawbacks, and even some potential hazards. But I'm no engineer and this is just a proposal. This could do a lot of good, not only for the weaker-willed among us (yes, me) but for the elderly or recovering. 

A connected smart home like this can help Alzheimer's patients in their day to day, or it could even help veterans who are struggling with PTSD by providing a calming, secure environment and calling their service animal, should they have one. 

We have this technology *right now.* Granted, it's hella expensive, but in time it will be available to the common person. 

Think how much it could help us in the long run. Hell, it could even help college students (with ""smart"" dorms) keep it together. 

What do you think, and what potential applications for this technology do you see?",24,21

It was (of course) wholly rejected by auto makers as too costly to implement. 

Having a brake light in the front grill not only lets pedestrians know if the car approaching them is stopping you're also able to see from your rear view mirror whether the car rushing towards you is stopping.

With the advent of self driving cars I'd suggest that the front facing brake light is going to be very important since pedestrians won't even be able to rely on seeing where a driver is looking to know what a car is likely to do (i.e. stop or not).

Internet markets theoretically pose more of a risk to power structures which provide a basic income - cash flow out of the domestic market is accelerated as citizens use their increased earning power to buy goods in markets their currency has more leverage in.

Inflation is not merely caused by increased demand, it is also caused by increased speculation and buyers who continue purchasing goods which have had their prices inflated past a reasonable level... medicine and light bulbs come to mind. This speculation will occur regardless of which market the goods are actually purchased in, foreign or domestic.

We have a limited amount of time until the end of the world when runaway global warming takes place and a limited amount of funds to invest in technology research that may or may not come to fruition in the time available.

Do we invest in renewable power generation - giving us more time to harness fusion power or do we sprint to the finish to fusion power and use the limitless power it will provide to build inefficient, but carbon capturing devices like sequestering, hydrogen fuel for cars and solar factories?

It seems like we are progressing on all fronts, but will we have the time to save the world?

What would you like to see happen first?

It has often been said that every next level of available energy allows developed nations to progress to another technological milestone.

What do you think would become available in an unlimited energy world? 

What has been held back by the cost of energy or overlooked due to the cost/benefit ratio?

How quickly will global warming come under control or be reversed when energy demands are met or exceeded?

Do you think that there are unforseen negative impacts, such as ignoring deforestation because it will have no impact on carbon if we are controlling our excess emissions with technology solutions?",5,8

There might be just a tiny little chance equal to a speck of dust in universe that it will be the best decision you have and ever will make in your life. Death is natural, not right. You have been told from little that it is natural part of life and it is OK. No. It really is not OK. Your loved ones for ever taken from you. Never to hear them laugh again, never to hear them speak,never to feel their touch. Never again will they do that one thing you always loved. Be the reason from something divine or from natural course of life, it is still not right.  

There will someday be a day when even the impossible feat of stopping aging will be achieved and they will look back and think how could we possibly so easily accept death and not fight it. So I ask of you dear redditors, please help me in trying to save my parents and all those loved ones that are sure to follow. Maybe. Just maybe. The impossible will happen and by helping me you will save your loved ones too. Because, I believe if anyone could ever achieve the feat of immortal life in our lifetime it would be me. Lets not start to argue the reasons for why this and should you believe them or not. You have nothing to lose from helping me and the whole world to gain.  

So Reddit could you help me on the small task of curing death and finding immortality?  

Please do not dwell on questions like overpopulation, and that even though aging could be stopped,or even reversed, we would still die from accidents or diseases. Or what if all do not want immortality. All of these and similar problems can be solved and lingering on these will only lead conversation to the wrong path.
How can you help? Well I would be truly honored and humbled if anyone could devote more than what I ask but I do not expect a miracle from you guys, only from myself. I only ask your expertise to help me choose from these choices what path I should travel to achieve this goal.  

1) Become scientist in the most relevant field to achieve this.
Pros: Almost guarantee to at least get closer to goal
Cons: Pretty much powerless if other necessary fields do not go forward  

2) Go into politics. Rally the people to this cause
Pros: Would , when succeeded at least be the second most effective method and possibly most.
Cons: Hard to achieve and the ever changing political atmosphere could ruin everything midway  

3) Become really really wealthy and fund all relevant fields or build a science center and gather all experts there.
Pros: Most likely the most effective solution
Cons: Hardest to achieve before it is too late  

4) Become a doctor
Pros: Best overall understanding of the subject? Naturally meet people that can help
Cons: Smallest power to get other people on board to the mission(investors etc.), own resources limited  

5) Put all my effort and bets on singularity( the moment first computer is smarter than a human and in theory could at a fast rate build more intelligent machines, every machine always smarter than the one before ). Some scientists have already guessed this could happen in the not so far future.
Pros: Pretty much guaranteed success if this would happen
Cons: Can it even happen or is it just a theory? And if it can happen will it still even give the desired effect?  

6) Other?

Lets stick to speculation about cause and effect and try to imagine a world where fueling your car and heating your home don't involve drilling for petroleum. 

Lets start with farming, vertical farming. Imagine farmland looking more like NYC than Kansas, with tall sky scrapers full of semi automated hydroponic systems so tall they have their own weather inside, their own rain, own eco systems. You would want to build them near the equator where sunlight shines year round and there would need to be local sources for water. Because they are nearly self contained, any water that goes in goes to the plants instead of evaporated back into the atmosphere. So their water footprint would be much smaller than an equivalent planting in conventional farms. 

You could vary the climate inside based on elevation and heat, with tropical plants towards the bottom floors, and cooler crops towards the top where elevation will help to limit temperatures, and at the tops you could grow crops that need gentle climates and limited water like grapes. 

I envision vertical farms like this growing food not just for consumption, but for fuel as well. With the help of microorganisms we can create a diversity of oil and sugar based bio fuels. Carbon dioxide released from burning these fuels is scrubbed by the plants themselves as they breath leading to a zero carbon footprint. Not only would they allow small plots of land to feed many people but they would provide fuel, textiles, drugs, plastics, and many other materials.

We would need natural plastics if the petroleum economy falls out. We would also need natural rubbers and other plants for building materials. 


So what would a vertical farm like this need? 

clean water

fresh carbon dioxide laden air

sunlight

minerals and fertilizers

plants and seed stock

insect or manual pollinators for some plants. 

built in processing facilities for creating raw industrial goods like fuels, plastics, textiles, etc. 

Lets start with water. The plants will need to breath and fresh air will need to be pumped in. We could use wind traps to get some of the water. We would definitely need to remove water from the waste air to prevent it from evaporating back out into the atmosphere. Direct surface water wouldn't exactly be needed; it may be possible to get most of the water from aquifers, further reducing losses due to evaporation. The warm moist air inside would rise to upper floors and cool and condense back into liquid water which would allow convection to do much of the work of pumping water to the upper floors. Gravity would work well for removing waste water for scrubbing and filtration in lower floors. 

Fertilizer. A lot of home hydroponics set ups use living fish for nitrate fertilizers. The fish live in the sump tanks and their waste provides nutrients for the plants. This could work on a larger scale for vertical farms with a byproduct of providing meat. 

Air movement, water pumping, and energy needs could be provided by wind power, like a combination windmill/skyscraper. We would need to limit solar panels as that light is needed for the plants. If needed some areas of the farm could utilize solar panels which may be desirable if their efficiency ever competes with the efficiency of plants. 

Logistics. We would need massive transport to get the finished products out of the farm and to the people. A rail network would make the most sense for now. They are efficient, scalable, and work well for fixed industry. 

One of the largest setbacks might be contagion. Having so many species in an enclosed eco system it would have to be carefully monitored to prevent the spread of disease that could harm the plants. Sanitation and sterilization of incoming goods would be important. Keeping it clean is just a good start though. You could have thousands or millions of small, smart sensors spread throughout the building, all powered by wireless similar to how rfid works now. Build a pulsed RF power network into the buildings backbown and you could have a truly wireless smart infrastructure full of many small nodes and sensors working together to form a smart mesh. If you add biochips into the mix for monitoring of pathogens you might be able to stop an infestation before it gains a foothold. 


Imagine how much life would change if you didn't have to ship agriculture products hundreds or thousands of miles to the consumer. Imagine vertical farms of various sizes spread throughout the city much like businesses are today. Imagine flying to Europe using biofuel grown in your city, and eating locally sourced produce and fish. 

Preventing the need for massive transportation to move raw resources and food back and forth between the heartland of a country and it's cities, would free up many highway systems, rail networks, and reduce the cost and energy demands of transporting goods. 

This would allow more land to be used for parks, and other forms of trasnportation like smart car highway systems, especially in gridlocked city areas where they are most needed. 

Think about how the highway system and travel might change if it wasn't needed as much for simple things like putting food on your plate or shipping oil from all over the world. 


What might it be like to live in a city with vertical housing, vertical farms, and even vertical manufacturing? How would it change the look of cities and how people get around in the city? How would it impact jobs and markets if city states had nearly self sufficient energy, food, and water? ",12,0

Are there any subs you can recommend that aren't in the sidebar that someone who wants to dig deeper from the cutting edge to the bleeding research edge can go to get his fix of complex discussion and futurological analysis of the impacts, behind these discoveries and technologies.

Love you all, have a good future",7,12

Sorry about that, but please educate me!  But the reason I ask is because a) we allow animal testing that we wouldn't allow for humans, and b) while the application of sapience to produce abstract knowledge-based intelligence over generations may be largely environmental, sapience itself is largely genetic, right?  And once the genetic/structural aspects are accounted for, shouldn't humans be able to train animals *how* to think abstractly?

Sapience may be genetically complex, but so are holistic aims like reversing the aging process.  At least sapience is confined to a single organ, and we have a good starting point in contrasting the genetics of humans from those of other primates.

Anyhow, I know that's a sloppy argument; I'm really just asking the question.  Is it reasonable to expect CRISPR to dramatically change opportunities for currently non-sapient animals both prior to and more dramatically than the changes to human opportunities?

The popular theme on this sub involves AI, exploration of the universe, driven towards singularity of consciousness, etc. very plausible, if not probable.

But..what about just getting really really high?

I believe there is a possibility that has not been addressed that is reasonable. Hear me out.
What if, before we create AI that can do all of our work for us, mostly in the sense that we no longer need to do the major work ourselves to progress/evolve/advance humanity,
a different branch of technology comes to us first. A very interesting drug, or combination of drugs.
What is this drug? well it has no side effects obviously, those have been worked out with our advancements in chemical and brain understandings. what it gives us is complete contentment and happiness, maybe even bliss or euphoria to whatever extreme you'd like to imagine. you do not grow ""tired"" of this feeling, as that means discontentment. Basic needs of food, etc have been met. 

The rest becomes somewhat philosophical.

Maybe this is our deepest drive. Why do we have such innate curiosity and need of purpose that leads to our impressive progression as a race? Maybe it doesn't matter. we ""like"" to go after these things because it gives us a ""feeling"". which is chemical. if these innate urges can be satisfied entirely by a drug. We may decide our end goal has been met, and live lives of pure bliss and contentment. and that the game of life has been won. Is envisioning a future of such a world to implausible for you? why or why not?

But the questions raised there got me thinking about immortality, especially of the artificial (non-biological) kind.  

When I think about immortality, I like to think of living out a happy, healthy and comfortable human life and having the opportunity to take on any human challenge imaginable.  I'd like to learn every language, learn to play every instrument and explore the planets as an (idealized) human being.  

When I think about immortality as a ""computer"" I think - Where is the fun or challenge in that?  If I could learn any language in an instant by simply loading a module; if I could learn any instrument the same way; if I could explore any planet without the physical challenge of protecting my biological body -- where is the challenge in that?

Complete mastery of all knowledge and the ability to instantly recall  it sounds **boring** especially when viewed from the perspective of eternity.  What is the point of having billions of years to one's self if nearly any problem can be corrected or any challenge overcome almost instantly?  

Convince me otherwise.",8,0

All of this achievable without one person being in, or anywhere near the cars. 

They can potentially drive inside large buildings car parks, inside underground tunnel systems and right up to the front of treasured landmarks. Now obviously as these cars start rolling out, due to the nature of the navigational technology I assume the car will have some sort of GPS capabilities that will be managed/tracked by someone, whether that's the manafacturer or what not. 

But once driverless cars are used for no good, or even before they are, won't a new age of surveillance and basically having someone know where our personal car is at all times be prevalent? Isn't this a privacy issue?

Sorry if wrong thread, couldn't think of elsewhere to post.

Based on Jeremy Howards work on the AI Deep Learning (Check out his TED talk here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4kyRyKyOpo) I have been considering its potential regarding DNA sequencing and genetic modification. As we increase our genomic databases with gene sequences Deep Learning can be utilized to recognize genetic similarities and aid in the research of gene expression. Further building on this, could this technology be used to suggest modified genetic code based on inputted characteristics? For example at a species level, could we utilize Deep Learning to recognize gene expression for leaner muscle mass of cattle and suggest the appropriate modifications? Or a broader example, could Deep Learning be utilized to identify expressions of high CO2 uptake in microbe and plant species? This may allow us to modify or create microbe or plant species with increased rates of production that aim to reduce greenhouse gases. Id love to hear everyones thoughts as well as other potential applications for Deep Learning with regards to genetic modification.",6,31

Blockchain/Bitcoin seems to be the only technology that can get us out of this mess. For anyone who doesn't know, block chain (the bitcoin backbone) is a group of computers that form an unbreakable encrypted pathway for people to send information directly to each other, or to a voting ballot box.  

So how close are we to creating a free standing, unhackable voting app for the blockchain/bitcoin network? It would probably need to use biometrics (preferably ones that only work when the person is alive) for authentication. If we wait for the government to impliment it, it would take too long.",94,31

So a tiny device could project a hologram you interact with, or it will be capable of understanding language and intent as well (probably better) than a human so you can get it to do what you want. I think phones that understand 'you' and your goals/agenda/beliefs strongly enough that they can accurately predict your needs before you are aware of them will be big in the next decade. Instead of thinking of what you want to google, your phone will know it before you do and tell you unsolicited.

What if humans take control and modify selective pressures more deliberately?

For comparison, [Homo heidelbergensis](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Homo_heidelbergensis_%2810233446%29.jpg) looked a lot like us, when physical adaptations for his current envoriment.

Personally, I think there are some interesting selective pressures on humanity at the moment, but the ones that will shape us in the next half-million years are the ones that both strongly affect reproduction, and stand to persist for a very long time. Even if humanity attempts eugenics, I am completely faithless in it's ability to keep the same coordinated selective pressures in place for millions of years. 


1.  We will develop resistance to a variety of drug-based birth controls. They are a direct impediment to reproduction, and we are likely to go on using them until they stop working. Life finds a way, although I suspect it can't find a way through a good old latex condom.

2. Brain development will become resistant to various kinds of modern toxins like alcohol (fetal exposure) and lead.

3. Humans will become less sexually mentally dimorphic as the rapidly changing desires of thousands of years of culture select for an adaptive individual over one born for a certain role. Future humans' sex hormone levels may begin somewhat more balanced and then fine-tune based on the pressures placed on them.

4. Our digestive system, while remaining very omnivorous, will absorb calories much more reluctantly, due to their abundance and selective pressure against obesity.

These things may happen even if we just go on living the way we are for a long time, but doubtless will will eventually discover a number of incredible technologies and a variety of new poisons that will put new selective pressures on us, but it's hard to say what will happen and what will stand the test of time.

We know that self-driving cars, nanobots, rockets to mars, and quantum computing are all coming; they're getting lots of mainstream press, regardless of timeline estimates. 

What are some technologies that are not being discussed in the mainstream media, that have to potential to surprise or blindside us, the way cars replaced horses? 

Edit 1: This discussion keeps getting down-voted, which I'm guessing might be happening because people want Futurology news in their feed, not discussions. If this was posted in the wrong place, can someone point me to a place where it would be more appropriate to post discussion. Thank you!

But in some far away future, when computers can harvest food, make clothes, construct houses, etc. all on their own, and people no longer have to work to get money to buy the things they value, what will determine how those things get divvied up?

One thought is that the cost of producing these things we currently value will become insignificant, and that everyone can have as much of everything they want without expending any effort. 

Another thought is that our standards of value will rotate into areas that are still untouched by AI, such as entertainment skills. As AI improves and starts to encompass more and more of these areas, we will eventually have to move out into standards of value which are increasingly ridiculous and unproductive (e.g. who can juggle the longest while riding a unicycle) as a means to differentiate people and determine who gets more or less of the robot-produced stuff.

I'll just go ahead and make some up. But I think we'll have combinations of these possibilities.

1) Collapse: Just short of the apocalypse. Could be a dust bowl that starves us to death. Could be conflict. Could be inflation. Or it could be a depletion of natural resources that keeps the world running.

2) Dystopia: We surrender more and more freedom to centralized institutions. Corporations, banks, governments, unions, cartels or monopolies, y'know the usual suspects.

3) Stagnant decline: We go out of our way to protect how everything is. Civilization deteriorates from squandered opportunity.

4) Zero Sum Disruption: Traditional economic staples of civilization fall off the ladder flat on their face in favor of new contenders.

5) Free For All: An abundance of viable choices arrives on the scenes that make centralized institutions decline. It's not a question of who to work for, but what you want to produce for trade or for yourself.

6) Homogeneous Utopia: Moneyless arcology based type 2 civilization with an autonomous economy. Nobody owns anything and everybody owns everything.",3,14

After computers can do everything humans can do better than humans can do them, the only way to earn money will be by owning capital. 

In our present society, only a select few own capital, and even fewer still own the means of production. If this is allowed to continue, there is a significant possibility that only a select few will have the means to subsist while most people are left destitute. This will all happen in a world with unprecedented levels of wealth. 

How will our societies allocate wealth once labour for money is no longer a viable method of spreading wealth around society? ",37,6

I was doing some thinking about Subvocalization Telepathy and ""Brain"" Computer interfaces.  Subvocalization is the ""voice"" you ""hear"" in you head when you are reading silently. These subvocalizations can be detected with machines that measure involuntary minute movement of muscles associated with speaking. (Im sure there is also brain signals that can be read by EEG associated with this subvocalization)
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization

My idea was to hijack these signals to be used for cheap silent computer interfaces or ""telepathy"". These signals should be able to read by and EEG or even the micro movements of the vocal cords. I have searched online and have found little information about anyone actually using this or the draw backs of trying to use Subvocalization as an input method. 

Does anyone have any additional information about using subvocalization for input methods. What do you think about using this for computer interfaces and telepathy. ",25,33

Oh, the stories our modern man would have to tell!  He is from nearly a thousand years in the future, and I'm sure the English commoner would love to hear about the mystical and magical wonders of the future.  
  
It wouldn't take long to establish that our ""average Joe"" essentially lives and eats better than the finest kings and lords of the past:  
  
- he has the perfect temperature in his home, whenever he wants.  
- he dines on a wide variety of top tier meats, cheeses, wines, and spices.  
- he has access to nearly infinite information, and can even use this access to look at uncouth things like naked women and funny cats.  
- he even has access to interactive worlds the likes of which don't even make sense when explained to the man-from-the-past.  
- he smells like soap all the time, and has a life span roughly double what the man from the past has, due to massive advances in medicine and sanitation.  
- etc. etc. etc.  
  
And yet, our ""average Joe"" is not satisfied with his life.  He wants to own his own business, and more than that - own an entire franchise of his creation, and be a millionaire... or perhaps even a billionaire.  
  
Our modern society has given our ""average Joe"" a legal way to join the noble class, true, but the man from the past is befuddled why he would even want it.  
  
""You have everything you could possibly want!  Food, porn, entertainment, comfort!  Why do you crave more?  If I had even a piece of your life, I would be endlessly happy!""  
  
-----------------  
  
**Now imagine the same conversation, but with an ""average Joe"" from our time, and an average man from 75 years in the future.**   
  
The man from the future leads an enviable life by today's standards:  
  
- He has perfect virtual reality that lets him experience nearly anything he can imagine with no consequences: sex dungeons, war recreations, space battles  
- He won't die of old age; that was recently solved.  
- He has an AI companion that compliments him and encourages him every day, and can anticipate his needs.  
- etc, etc, etc.  
  
And yet, *our man from the future still wants more*.  He wants to rise up to the next 'class' of society.  His plan is to slowly learn about programming, encryption, and political theory in order to propose new solutions to managing society on a multi-planetary scale.  He also hopes his contributions to robot rights will allow him to rise through the classes and be recognized as one of the ""elites"".  
  
Our man from the present is confused though: ""Why?  You have everything you could ever need!  You have endless companionship, and hell - if you wanted it: orgies.  You could lose yourself for years in the most advanced video games ever created.  You have a life that even the richest person in my time couldn't dream of.... why would you want more?""  
  
And the man from the future answers: **Because I want the same thing that every human has wanted, for thousands of years: to be important, and to matter.**

In this quote, Musk mentions all technology, which includes his mission to Mars, as well as the subject matter of most posts in /r/Futurology/.   

[Some background on war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4).     

As we recognize this holiday season, most Americans are having a [hard time dealing with money](http://i.imgur.com/61lDc.gif) already.   

In order to fix this, I strongly think we would need to reenact [Executive Order 11110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110), which President Kennedy signed into law on June 4, 1963. This law created an American currency, rather than one from a [for-profit, private bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5PfJubkgoQ).    

Otherwise, the **near** future of the U.S. [looks bleak for our children](http://i.imgur.com/PB6ny5M.jpg?1).",11,22

Does anyone have any evidence to the contrary?

Do you think his predictions were too optimistic? Would a revised timeframe now be appropriate?

Do you think alternatives will become a reality before we reach robust human rejuvenation?

In a sense, it could be our communities fireside chat.  It would allow us all to voice our opinion and have a more favorable conversation about an interesting topic.  So before I go any further, I want every one reading this post to imagine themselves sitting by a campfire, drinking what ever beverage of choice, having a good time with your mates.  I would hope that everyone can agree that backing claims up with good evidence is a good idea however I don't want that to discourage anyone from voicing their ideas and opinions, no matter how ludicrous you might think they are!  I mean, keep the conversation relatively on topic but if you don't understand something or want an answer, ask that shit!  You having that question means theirs probably hundreds, if not, thousands of people out there thinking of asking the same thing.  (Exhale) 

So, welcome to the first week of WhatTheFuture's Fireside Chat.  I didn't want to use the name r/Futurology 's fireside chat, for fear of the mods taking this post down under ""false advertisement"".  I instead, used WhatTheFuture because its the title of my podcast.  Which you can find here [whatthefuture!](https://whatthefuture.fm)  We talk about a lot of cool stuff, things I know every lurker on this subreddit finds interesting.  Take a look at our episodes and website and give us feedback.  How can we better the experience for you, the listeners? 

Alright, now to the good stuff.  This week we will be talking about a global military for Earth that will protect us from any negative threats.  I.E. (Aliens, asteroids, etc.)  I want to discuss an allowable and well founded prediction or theory on how and when this will happen.  

To better understand what I'm talking about when I say Earth military, just look at Star Trek.  Their, obviously fictional organization, protects the beings of Earth from the dangers of the outside world, or world(s).  When do we think this will happen to us?  Is it going to take something so catastrophic, like an alien invasion, to persuade the world to create such organization?  Who will be in control?  These are just but a few of the questions that could be asked to answer the major underlying question, when and how will we create a global military?

I live in an urban city, but being in America, it's hard to imagine nit having a car.",12,2

Your best friend is the sidekick, your gf is ""the girl"", and etc. Imagine actually *being* the character and experiencing the movie as that individual. If you're feeling lazy and just want to chill out, then you go along with the pre-scripted version. Think you can improvise, and the limelight is yours.

Well I believe in Kurzweil's Singularity and that we are right at the cusp of immortality and a level of civilization never fathomed by human imagination. And I damn well don't want to miss it by a decade or so. I want Kurzeil to see it. 

Political corruption is inefficiency. At this point, I'm blatantly asking for financial support and in doing so, I'll reduce my quality of life in outrageous respects by publicly broadcasting myself at all time and from all angles. I'll reduce my diet to rice and protein shakes (if the hivemind so declares). I'll read the damn bills in their entirety. I'll make weekly youtube fireside chats and speak very candidly and with lots of cursing. I will explain my reasoning and seek intelligent discourse. I'll spend eight hours a day answering skype questions and studying economics or whatever the sub-reddit decides.

I'm volunteering every piss, fart and dirty picture I google. I have no shame. I want to see heat death and there is no price too high.

I want you to know that I understand how silly and immature an idea this comes across as, especially by those whose opinions I hold in regard. But they are wrong and I'll subject myself to ridicule and examination to prove so.  I think even the incredibly intelligent are likely to mistake the curve for a line. 

Now is the time to be desperate. You are under-estimating. Careers will dry up quicker than an old dog can learn new tricks. Driving will now longer be a viable profession in 5-10 years. It will only get worse from there. That's why my platform would be framed around basic income and automation. The current stock of front-runners are miles from the real and brutal conversations we should have been having ten years ago. 

Invent your insanely educated, sub-subservient politician and I'll do it as decided upon. I need the minimum payment on my debts and enough for food and shelter. I'm pretty damn drunk at this point so don't be surprised if I'm very embarrassed about this in the morning, but sober me is a puss and don't listen to him.

Edit: oh geez, I forgot I did this. I'll try to respond to everything after work.

Edit2: Let me start off with that I don't actually want to do this. The idea of it scares me senseless. Nor am I particularly well qualified, but I'm willing to work hard to be so. I'm not really killing it at life or superbly financially responsible. I have some anxiety and depression (and kinda froze up at the response this got). But I feel compelled to try anyway, (especially while drinking apparently). And there is no harm in trying other than a lifetime of embarrassment for me, my friends and family.

I first I was pretty discouraged with overwhelming negative responses, but hey, upvotes don't lie so I guess I'm going to go forward with it over at /r/automationparty. I'm currently traveling home for the holidays but over the next few days I'm going to copy the good questions here and put them into an FAQ over there.

If you're onboard with this idea at all, please consider uping [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/newreddits/comments/3y12en/automation_party_im_considering_running_for/) thread as I don't want to clutter r/futurology any further. If you, like many of the commenters here do, think it's childish nonsense, why not enjoy a good trainwreck.",1341,3075

Well I believe in progress for the sake of finding solutions to our problems. We are travelling down a road of inequality which is currently driving our high incarceration and violence in this country. I don't want us to miss an opportunity to use our current technology to work smarter, and thus harder. 

Political corruption is inefficiency, by definition. I'm not asking for handouts, that's what taxes are for. I will however happily take a sub 100K a year salary to live comfortably while I work for the people. I don't see a need to give a 24/7 lifecast of myself. However, I don't think C-SPAN is enough transparency. I would adopt the ""TrudeauMetre"" style of reporting progress on issues and promises. This is a living tracker that changes as the world does. Keep me honest. 

I admit there are alot of people who do not want this system. I see that there is a demand for people like Donald Trump. This is an effect of having a diverse country. As a diverse country, we must be flexible in how we do things and NO ONE should feel unwelcome here. We are founded by immigrants.

Now is the time to be educated. You are all valuable in working towards a better nation. Careers will change quickly as technology increases and innovation will maintain stability. Driving will no longer be a viable profession in 5-10 years. It will only get BETTER from there. That's why my platform would be framed around a mixture of basic income and capitalism. The current stock of front-runners are close to the real conversations we should always be having. How do we solve basic problems in 2015. Digital voting systems, a slow re-balancing of the economy through wealth re-balancing, and private funding for research, not government. Those are just a few big issues that come to mind in keeping our government honest.   

I am not drunk. I do care about the future of this country as I am sure our politicians do. The key difference is that money drives corruption and I think that is what some other people on this subreddit are getting at. Take this as a debate prompt, I am not running for office... ever. I have a great engineering career. ",51,103

Despite of all the progresses, human nature, which takes a long time to evolve, has still remained in the same level with the medieval kings, priests, and knights.

In other words, quite a lot of people are not too capable of understanding, or helping, the great progresses. They are able to use the new tech with better interface, but are not likely to understand or make things happen with them. 

For a large portion of population, the new tech are little more than new toys, like the old noblemen of Alexandria who thought Hero's steam engine was nothing more than a new toy.

I do think that transhumanism is the only way to overcome human nature, which is limited by millennia of evolution thru environments which are not exactly compatible with all the progresses. 

Willpower, like zen, sufism, mysticism , can only do so much. Even the greatest zen master on earth has to eat, or at least drink tea.

To overcome human nature, transhumanism has to go with futurology. Unless human nature can be overcome, all the progresses will be just nothing more than new sources of toys.

Without transhumanism, the 'monkey' nature will not disappear and mankind will revert to the old habits",1,0

Why not create a people-power fueled outlet that will allow us to express ourselves directly? This idea would tie together the reproducability of a viral media or hashtag campaign with a sense of groundedness, say by taking photos at one's local polling place. 


The 2016 election cycle presents a unique opportunity for political engagement in the United States. This is because it is during the election years that political participation in US democracy on the part of citizens becomes largest. The Trump and Sanders campaigns are the two campaigns that have attracted the most enthusiastic supporters. 

For those of us looking to see positive social trends, it would be a shame to let the phenomenon of the Sanders/Trump campaigns go to waste like we did the Ron Paul 2012 campaign. Ron Paul was shunned by the media, and the coalition he brought together of conservatives, libertarians, and progressives eventually fell apart. The various factions regrouped, and have come to participate in this election cycle on opposite sides. 

This moment provides the opportunity to create a system of collective expression that is not beholden to corporate monopoly interests. Both the Trump and Sanders campaigns, as well as their supporters, have been frustrated by media misrepresentation. This misrepresentation occurs because the establishment has been trying to downplay the appeal of these two candidates. 

The big idea is that an anti-corporate media stance would be supported by populists on the left and right, as well as those centrists who are concerned about centralized corporate and state control. Let us explore the possibility of investing in a process which is not geared toward the election of any one candidate in particular, but that should let all candidates and ideas which are not favored by media monopolies be seen by an interested public. 

To this end, let us put aside our political disagreements for a moment and agree that whatever political conflicts exist should be hashed out by the people, and not by corporate media monopolies that serve above all the interests of the most wealthy and powerful vested interests. Let us continue to argue, but in a way that empowers the people generally, instead of we the people relying on corporations and the government to do our political work for us. 

My proposal to get this started is for us all to go to our local polling places and take a picture of a sign and perhaps a party hat. On the sign, we could answer the question what do you think 2016 will be the year of? A hashtag only makes sense, my suggestions would be #newyearsrevolution or #yearofhere. I think that if we initiated some kind of viral campaign like this, it would give Americans somewhere to post to get their messages out to the rest of the country and the world, and somewhere for us all to look for such information. Eventually, we will need serious infrastructure to have some sort of open-source media or something like that, but that can come later. 

Let's make moves against the media monopolies that are strangling our minds!

See /r/sharingeconomy


Some examples of 'sharing economy' include:

**Uber** - people using their own personal vehicles as taxis

**AirBnb** - people using their personal homes as hotel rooms 

In the future there might be more examples of *sharing economy* as more people find ways to share/rent goods and services. Expensive items are especially likely to becoming part of the 'sharing economy.' Someday driverless vehicles might be shared among a neighborhood or community.


Along with the definition there is a link to a related subreddit (/r/sharingeconomy)  for more information.

2107,2015-12-28,2015,12,28,11,3ygyof,Vyrdism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3ygyof/vyrdism/,Yuli-Ban,1451269742,"I present to you a more focused detailing of my previous words here. Thanks to a guy named Henry Vyrd, the idea behind [technostism](/r/Technostism) has been streamlined greatly, so I can finally convey all I need to say in just a few words.

In honor of him, I've scrapped technostism's original baggage and streamlined *it* down to meaning ""**full workplace automation, or the pursuit of such in the name of profiting directly from automated labor**.""

Now onto [Vyrdism](/r/Vyrdism). 

What plagues society is income inequality, which has reached extreme and unsustainable levels, and the root cause of this is control over business operations. This is why the conservative left has largely failed they aim for higher taxes on businesses in order to fund welfare, rather than treating the problem at the source.

Vyrd believed that we should create a national networked federation of worker cooperatives. This is meant to compete against *and* cooperate with traditional enterprises. The thinking is that low and middle skilled workers will opt to work at the cooperatives, while higher skilled workers head for the specialized jobs that capitalists offer. Capitalists, meanwhile, will be shocked by the labor flight that occurs and will invest heavily in automation in order to offset the rapid loss of workers. Those who fail to do so will see their businesses bought by workers. This all works to bring the price of automation down to affordable levels which the worker federation capitalizes upon. The worker cooperatives, too, become automated, and the workers act as the beneficiaries, shareholders if you will. 

Automation becomes cheaper and cheaper until anyone can afford their own personal worker. This breeds [helotism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3v12kx/helotism/) as well, where there exists a large pool of [technotarians](http://technostism.wikia.com/wiki/Technotariat) that are owned in common. Technotarians can be loaned to a person who lacks ownership in order for them to buy a wage-earning robot of their own, and it is through this [seed loan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3f93me/seed_loans_the_solution_to_technological/?ref=search_posts) that any person can become a member of the worker cooperative federation post-technostism.

The helots, since they work for the People, work in order to provide a basic guaranteed income. Helots cannot be loaned to any particular person, and they fulfill State roles.

Eventually, through technotarian ownership, all humans become part of the [networking class](http://technostism.wikia.com/wiki/Networking_class) and an [economically] classless society is achieved, where social class is instead based upon personal merit and talent.

Vyrd said it himself consider it 'communism via bourgeoisie', where instead of proletarian revolution, we all become capitalists exploiting the labor of robots. In fact, exactly as Marx himself said would happen. Vyrd also went on about abundance and free market socialism and whatnot, but this is the gist of his ideas.

PS: Vyrd was a [Market Technostist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Technostism/comments/3uzzk8/there_are_already_two_camps_market_technostism/), by far. He never mentioned tax-based UBI because he was actually a conservative libertarian before I described technostism to him. Because Vyrdism is ""Nouveau-Leftist"", it treats the economic conditions with economic action first and puts State action last.",1,3

How people would react to having semi-intelligent droids do everything necessary for them is something I'd like to watch. I'd like to see the social repercussions, the economic side-effects, things like that.
I mean, I guess I answered myself. Such a game would be well known and studied, and anyone who's ever heard of the Internet would know of it. Unless, you know, it's a relatively small, overlooked game that no one really cares about.

About [technostism](/r/technostism). I've already tweaked it before, and now it's become Vyrdism. Seeing real people react to it would be a boon. Y'know, I'd rather not have created another variant of Stalinism or Nazism.

I don't usually do new year resolutions, but I have taken some time to think about goals I would like to achieve and places to travel in 2016. I think I am fairly passionate about the future and want to make it the best possible. So in 2016 I want to up my involvement in things I think will be helpful to humanity and humanities overall future. These are some of the things I've come up with so far. 

Buy a HTC vive. Virtual reality is just the first step to expanding our ability to enjoy like and tell stories. Get a Tesla Powerwall. Though I have stable power i could use a backup battery bank for bad weather. I believe the future is renewable and distributed. Buying batteries now only helps speed that and EVs along. Also it's the cheapest way to truthfully say ""I've got a tesla in my garage"". :3   In 2016 I really hope I could get my full genome sequenced for around $1000. Genetics is probably the most promising area of future related technologies that we have right now. Right now we need a larger population sample size to help understand the human genome. That's all I got for right now. I'm sure more will come to me over time and new things will pop up in 2016.

This includes manufacturing technology (3d printing), computing power, battery efficiency, etc.  Traffic remains a huge problem in many major cities, only getting worse all the time.  I think within 30-40 years flying cars are inevitable.  You have AI that is improving exponentially, as well as driverless cars already in testing phase.  Materials are getting stronger and lighter and I think commercially used drones will be the precursor to flying cars.  Once they're made legal in the air space, companies like Amazon will use them to ship goods from local warehouses to people's homes.  This commercial drone technology will improve over time - first perhaps only able to carry x sized items with x amount of weight, leaving the extra heavy and  extra large items to be shipped the more traditional way.  Therefore it would be in their best interest to continue developing more efficient drones that can handle more weight and larger items, leading to a point where 200 lbs is handled fairly easily.  Once this milestone is hit, entrepreneurs or companies like Tesla or Uber may see the potential for human transport.  At first it would either be just used by the rich or used as a taxi service (or both) but with further exponential leaps in technology it would inevitably be used by many people as a much faster way to commute.  You choose your destination and the on board AI will take you there, while at the same time communicating with every other such vehicle - to avoid a collision.  ",14,3

They had to win the war before Americans were committed en masse, and they had about 3 months of window to do so.

However, at that time the entire German forces were commanded by Erich Ludendorf, who was a quartermaster general. He himself had no confidence over a single battle ending the war, and so he frittered his formidable forces in half-successes.

When he only had enough forces for one shot, he held some of his punch for 'future offensives' and it was he who lost the war for the German Empire.

Because of him, Germany got into some rough straits, like the inflation, freikorps, an Austrian with a funny mustache and everything he and his minions brought in.

It has not regained its most resource-rich regions, now ruled by Poland and protected by the good ol' US Army, which still occupies Germany to this day.

Right now I feel the same way about the future.

Sure, the tech breakthroughs in the last years have been nothing less than amazing, and more headways are being made as well.

However, there are a few problems spoiling the soup.

1) The rentier problem

The rentiers , including those who claim copyrights and other 'intellectual property rights', are proving to be a big nuisance. 

To combat them it is necessary to have ties with big corporations, which can combat these almost parasitic class but have agenda on their own.

The necessity of a big corporation to get anything done means tech will advance in a way for them to make huge amount of money, which may not be the right direction to advance (such as the old typists defeating the more efficient dvorak keyboard, or Microsoft's mediocre products swamping out everything else)

2, Geriatrics.

Caring for the old is going to consume a huge portion of virtually all advanced country's budgets. Granted new medical advances will make this problem easier, but they are not free.

And, because the old tends to have political power due to their voting power, a lot of money is going to be spent to extend their lives, which are more likely to be reactionary and less likely to innovate or advance.

Hillary will be 69. Trump 70. Sanders even older. Hardly people to lead the world to the newer era. 

Even Mao Tse-tung, who led china into communism and killed lots of US soldiers in Korea, softened up at the age of 79 when he sat with Nixon on 1972.

That means , a lot of people would be old folks who are unlikely to lead the world to new heights, while consuming vital resources from the younger generation who would be more strained to care for the old.

3) Resource depletion

Although oil prices are low, other resources are not abundant everywhere. I think the world will be ok till 2040 - 2045 but after that it is anybody's guess. Overpopulation is also part of this category.

All of the above have the possibility of ending the great progress and a new generation for the humanity. I think 2) is the most dangerous since they do have political power which could sway the whole civ into the wrong direction, although in that case the more creative part of population would probably run from them.

If mankind has failed to reach Type I civ , or at least achieve a real AGI, then I don't think the more advanced part of humanity can survive the backlash from those who are not 'in' there. It is always necessary to keep a distance of a generation between the advanced and the rest, and if it is broken the rest will overtake the vanguards and bring them down, somewhat like Pol Pot's Cambodia.",8,0

But what is behind that attitude?

Even at the height of ""Space Age"" hype when people were being told by all authorities that the future was a bright, beautiful, effortless place, *still* general culture was defaulting to post-apocalyptic shitpile futures: Atomic mutants chasing around barbarous cavemen around the ruined rubble piles of obliterated civilization.  So clearly it's not an extrapolation of current experiences: It occurs in good times and bad alike.

Is it just stupidity?  Are people just not imaginative enough to picture a future other than a present that has been corrupted or destroyed?  That is of course part of it, especially where Hollywood is concerned: Rubble makes for cheaper sets than trying to design a credible-looking advanced civilization that's clean and functional.  But I think there's something more there.

People are **afraid** of there being no End.  The idea that humankind will not just be stamped out in a dramatic cataclysm, nor dwindle away in some degenerate state - that it will instead grow, and divide, and speciate into unknown alienness...ideas like that seem to genuinely terrify people.  That nothing they know will continue, and yet their descendents will continue and change forever...it's a blasphemous thought to people who place great store in their own values and cultural assumptions.

What makes it even more unpalatable is the projection of evolution forward - the idea that we are not nature's pinnacle achievement, but just another ripple in an endless cascade.  People in general can accept human evolution as a process *toward* us, because it feeds our egos - we can pretend we are the purpose of all that went before.  But evolution *away* from us, that is scary.

Imagine, if you will, *millions* of species.  Not millions of individuals, but entire *species* - all descended directly from humans who spread out into the cosmos.  Some of them, due to local cataclysms and ecological limitations, ended up as once again dumb animals.  Others, as significantly altered but still beings we would recognize as sentient, technological animals.  Some developed beyond comprehension.  Some extinct.  But none of them us.  None of them that wouldn't inspire either terror, disgust, contempt, or awed vertigo if we could see them in our mind's eye.

The infinite future; the alien future; the future that has forgotten us and yet dares to continue anyway; the future born not from any apocalypse marking our passing, but just one moment flowing into another, one gene pool branching from another; for all practical purposes, *forever*.  This thought causes many people to run and hide, to find Apocalypse a comforting thought by comparison.

As much as some self-absorbed people seem to find it troubling that other people will continue after they die, so some also find it troubling that humanity - and all that will follow from it - may continue after everything they recognize or understand is gone.  

When all our nations are gone; when all our languages are unrecognizable; when all the history we know and imagine to be so deep is seen as just the dimmest of blips at the Dawn of Time; and our planet and star are both dust in the galactic wind; there may be within other beings, the tiniest flicker of something that was something that was something that was us.  

And yet they will not know us, and will not understand, and will give no more of a shit than you do that the mitochondria in your cells were once the dominant lifeforms on primordial Earth.  *This* scares people more than a nice, neat End.

(Update: Just to be clear, since there seem to be many wildly mistaken comments, fantasizing about everything staying exactly the same forever is NOT wanting an infinite future - that's wanting the present to be endlessly repeated, which is the exact opposite of a realistic future where change is eternal).

1. Is this a worthwhile consideration, given the time frame? Megacities might not be as common as the military seems to think in the latter half of the range.  
2. What effect will this have on military tactics and strategies? Cities are already difficult to navigate, sweep, and control. Megacities will offer more opportunities for civilian casualties and less opportunity to use tanks and many sensors, weakening industrially capable powers like the US and China.  
3. What other risks might megacities create for militaries engaging in them? Obviously there's more cover, opportunity for ambush, and more escape routes, but what other risks am I not thinking about?  
4. What potential benefits are there to operating in megacities? Increased surveillance capacity, maybe? Greater opportunity to interface with locals and build trust-based relationships?

http://hooning.rocks/articles/the-worlds-largest-diesel-engine-is-producing-109000hp

 ""Each hour the Finnish sea going diesel devours over 39 barrels of oil to keep it running.""

So i searched for more articles that might get into the pollution side of this all as the first article is just admiring the feat of engineering. 

""The most staggering statistic of all is that just 16 of the worlds largest ships can produce as much lung-clogging sulphur pollution as all the worlds cars.""

Source- 
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1229857/How-16-ships-create-pollution-cars-world.html

I couldn't find a definite answer on to how many container ships are at sea daily.   ""There are now over 100,000 transport ships at sea, of which about 6,000 are large container ships.""  

Source- 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_shipping


Just accounting for the 6,000 large container ships, that's 375 times the amount of pollution as automotive produces (lung-clogging sulphur pollution).

That is only one part of many more that are detrimental to earth and the people of earth.  I understand that shipping is what keeps the economy moving but the point i want to get out is that there are very little regulations to the emissions of container ships and very much the opposite to automotive.  

Why is this the case when it is clear that automotive is such a small piece of the puzzle compared to energy plants, container ships, ect? Why have we been so blind to the real problem? Is there someone pulling strings to cover up the real problem? loss of profits? 


*if there is a better place for this let me know*

I hope i at least got you thinking outside the box. Please provide your opinion, information, articles, ect. that can add to this.

I think that is because of the editors, who still have the 'traditional' mindset, and simply can't stand stories which do not end in the means they could understand.

Right now, most movies are just regurgitation of old themes, tried to tiredness for decades. 

That is probably because movies are big business and the average moviegoers are not likely to understand the tricks, which are rather mundane and do not make interesting spectacles.

Still, human imagination appears to lag quite a bit compared to the speed of tech progress now. 

http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/84128/will-real-world-applications-ever-need-a-128-bit-flat-address-space

This link is 4 yrs old and I have not seen too much discussion on 128-bit computing - in fact quite a lot of folks still use 32-bit computing.

---

There are so many possibilities, but I personally feel all these technological power has been utilized for inefficient use.

The amount of data is humongous but most of them are streaming videos or retweets, relinks, etc, and after cutting the lard off the amount of 'meat' is similar to a few years ago. 

I personally think the human imagination to utilize all the available tech has hit some kind of brick wall, or very close from doing so. Sure, all these techs made life a bit easier, but they have not been able to make fundamental changes to lifestyle, how people conduct their lives, etc. Telecommunicating is cool but to get ahead office politics still works.

Human behavior patterns, even with all these progress, have not truly changed too much and because of that human imagination, and therefore the ability to utilize all these tech, has lagged too.

Some believe there is no limit to imagination, but in reality I am afraid to say that there might be a limit of new stuff the people could take on, and once that limit is passed they can digest no more, making progress stop at that point.... ",4,0

I recently became privy to this sub and it seems the perfect place to have a discussion of my idea and so here I am.  

It strikes me that currently as a species we are making huge advancements in the fields of technology and computing.  AI and robotic manufacturing capabilities have been improving at an incredible rate as well, and I feel that relatively soon (50-ish years) we will be at a point where the entire production process for all goods can be fully automated.  This would have several implications both economic and social

Economically we would see the cost of everything fall dramatically.  Cost is more or less a reflection of human labor involved in manufacturing a product.  If a product requires many hands and much time and oversight, it will be expensive, because all those workers need to be paid.  If the product is produced entirely by robots the cost is nearly zero and the product could be free.  If everything was made for free, everything could be sold for free.  

Now you have a situation where nobody works in industry, but all goods are free and so you can live comfortably with no income because everything you need you can get for free.  At this point we could get rid of money.  But what about services that could only be provided by a human, like a lawyer or a psychologist you ask?  Well we would still have roles like those in our society but they wouldn't be paid.  Why?  Because they don't need to be paid because they can exist for free.  

At this stage we would have a world where there would be no economically imposed limits on anything.  Unlimited medical research, unlimited R&amp;D for NASA, unlimited R&amp;D for bettering our automated production system.  Anything that could be done could be done to its fullest potential because it could be done for free.  

I think that this future is not only a beautiful utopian world where anybody can fully dedicate themselves to whatever they wish, but also a world that is becoming ever increasingly likely due to our continued advancements in technology.  Feedback?

TL;DR everything is free, everything is wonderful.",25,15

Even a research update would be nice.  An example of this is a few months ago, a scientist accidentally discovered a longer lithium-ion rechargeable battery by adding something like aluminum oxide and letting it soak for several hours (just paraphrasing/guessing).  The article lead the reader to believe that this new method would lead to incredibly stronger, more reliable rechargeable batteries in the near future, as this technique was easily scaleable to mass produce.  However, I've not heard anything of the sort.

Everything from cancer research, strong materials, engines, anything and everything that could meaningful improve quality of life and progress technological evolution, and yet...

I mean, how many years ago did BMW announce they had a car that only produced water vapor as a by-product and the tagline at the end of the commercial stated ""Ready for the world, when the world is ready""?  And yet, all I keep reading is about fully-electric cars will be ready by x years in the future, without a second thought given to the article.


So what I'm asking is:  Is it possible to catalogue and keep up-to-date information available as to the progress and development of innovations and/or when they are expected to come to market?  It'd be incredibly helpful for keeping track of innovations and scientific progress.  If nothing more, it'd be helpful for weeding out junk articles.",10,6
