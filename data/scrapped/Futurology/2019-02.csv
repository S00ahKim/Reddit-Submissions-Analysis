&amp;#x200B;

I think avatars will be great to help with domestic tasks.

You arrivetired at home. You ask your avatar to take out your shoes.

While the avatar is not able to do that task automated someone you hire will do it for you remotely.

Then, you ask what meals can be done with the ingredients that you have available at home. Hundreds of meals will be suggested with your remote chefs ready to control the avatar. You choose the meal you want and the remote chef.

You go to your room to rest a bit while your meal is being prepared and another avatar does you a body massage. You just need to tell what kind of massage you want and the remote massagist you want to hire.

Also, another avatar remotely can be doing your laundry, ironing, cleaning, going outside to put the garbage in the bin, etc.

You can just outsource cheap remote labor do do everything for you for cheap.

Most of the things will soon be automated. You just tell the avatar using voice: ""pick up milk from the fridge"" and it will do that automatically without the need for remote control.

Also when someone is doing you a remote massageyou can make sounds to express how much you are enjoying a certain area being massaged and AI will work with remote massager tooptimize the experience.

You could have a kind of Turing test for when a remote massage performed by an avatar is indistinguishable from a real massage from a human being at your place. Same for cooking, ironing andother domestic tasks.

I can see remote avatars also being used to clean streets from litter, going to a shop to buy something and then going to the post office to deliver it.

I think not only avatars will be remote controlled. You can also have people being remote controlled. You want to go for a date and you will be able to hire someone that is in a date in a specific place that you fancy and you will be able to experience the dating in real time. Most of the dating will be a passive experience but then you can instruct the avatar of the real person you are hiring to be remote controlled and tell him remotely to mention specific things like:""I like your trousers, where did you buy them and how much did they cost? You can buy a similar one at the following website for a much cheaper price...""

Or: ""Tell me more about that traveling that you were talking about. Where exactly did you stay and how much did it cost? I think you would also like to go to Ibiza""...",3,1,False,self,,,,,

My question is in the title. With self driving vehicles becoming more prevalent it seems more and more self evident that each and every family owning a vehicle is an inefficient and environmentally unconscious way to live. 

It is my belief that once self-driving vehicles are perfected there should be no reason, save auto makers wanting to sell more vehicles, that every family should own their own car. 

I believe it would be best for a society of the future to replace all vehicles on the road with self driving vehicles owned collectively by everyone. The concept goes further to having civilians be able to call a vehicle up to pick them up and take them to a destination, and the vehicles could cycle out daily for maintenance. 


I think this is a good idea but I'm not sure where to go to refine it or where to float it that people may see it and act on it. I myself have no expertise in any of the related fields and I even doubt myself as being the first of this concept but it is something I haven't heard discussed but wish to put towards action. 

Thank you.

The institutional government is formed by a center of the regenerative channels as a brain of an organism. It is not just affected and does not dictate. It creates the whole model of the control solution. The human being will be motivated to see the whole rational picture in compact invariant-adjusted compression. All of behavior and production will be centered around this vision.

Personal requests and inputs will be processed with the whole technological power of a social organism. A human being gets real freedom to see reality and make choices that would be secured with all of organistic society power. The best of choices are symbiotic in the priciple. A separate body cell will never become malignant if the brain-neural regulation will bring the SQ-matrix being complete and filled with symbiotic prospect. This is just the law of the synergy-quantum physics of the most freedom instead of the least resistance in closed energy. The most freedom is a growing and compact tunneling in an external cooperation. Thats why the individual regenerative life and society will be agreed with the whole power of the symbiotic abilities. 

A mutual regenerative work will inhance that individual and social abilities. Its motivations is to get more the personal rate in the whole regenerative process. That would mean more space for its individual freedom to live. Instead temptations to keep a brain dormant  a person would see unlimited spaces and try to get them. Its specializing, skills and activity will be formed with the tremenouse symbiotic plans. The variety of endless creation instead hard exhausting work and death. Such would be highest motivational choice for everybody.  These are the pictures of the new-coming organistic society of the Synthetic Informational Democracy. That would be democracy of the adequate self-control.

How long it would take? The last century moved the technological progress scale from hundreds year to tens years. The 21-t century is just years-scale progress time. The Information Synthesis based regenerating channels and centers will cover the Earth and focus this Earth ship to the open future fast.  The venture capital and other investments will flood up this area for nearest several years. This is the Challenge of making a Dream being complete formed (compact), rational and constructively true... The first time in the human history... personally... from now...

The history includes the intensive intentions (Albert Abrams, Ruth B. Drown, Hulda Regehr Clark, Thomas Galen Hieronymus, Georges Lakhovsky, Antoine Prior, Royal Raymond Rife, Hercules Sanche, George de la Warr) in finding a complete EM- and magnetic fields based treatment, for the first of all, cancer and other dreadful diseases. However even having a partial biophysics results they were not based on a scientific foundations of the synergistic physical material and biological body construction. So their separate effects and intuition based methods and means were often not recognized with official medicine and often were mixed up and with mystics and misuse \[73-92\]. Meanwhile the right approach \[5-11, 93\] is to built in all of studied oscillating effects and techniques into the compact Synergy-Quantum control system to get complete-regenerative result. The oscillation effects are fundamental but should be merged into the model, which gives a body certain physical substance and organism fundamental background.

Not separated frequencies heal diseases but Synergy Matrix exactly determined and profiled pack (bundle) of modulated frequencies of different carriers and agents including mechanical (surgeries), chemistry (pharmacological) and genetics individual engineering could bring a complete positive result in a current practice. The individual Synergy Matrix explication would give aCompleteRegenerative Medicineand a complete regenerating way of a living as soon as human being will be concentrated on this reality.

What it happens in biological synergistic systems (organisms) and their superstructure symbiotic systems (many levels organisms)? The internal quantum consummation is limited by an entropy condition (energy conservation). This limit gives closed systems. Amount of energy in closed system is constant. However a living system is always open and changing its structure. The functional arrangement that is formed in closed system does not manage those forced or reasonably structure changing. So just a functional processing always leads to collapse after certain amount of resources are scooped out.The Living Regeneration is linked with entity of asynergisticenergy revival.This is why living processes are different from of functional (mechanistic) ones. The living system of a cell or many-cells organism adjusts itself to get energy revival similar to as a radio receiver gets energy by adjusting its oscillating structure.The goal is how thisadjustmentis organized in principles,measurementsand construction. This is the key for aging, cancer,Alzheimersand similar diseases identification and complete-reversibletreatment with complete vital function regeneration as nearest reachable result.

Ive proposed these universal principles and procedures, as a constructive approach, in 1986 (Kyiv, Kharkiv) and 1988 (Alushta) in the science reports then they were approved in frame of number of the the USSR and Ukraine state research programs \[7,8\]. The solutions included theSynergy-Quantum Self-Organizing Processor (Synergon)construction in principles, procedures that giving an architecture of the Complete Autonomic (living) System Control. These approaches included theSynergon-ResonanceTunnelGyroscopeconstruction and theInformation Synthesis Reactorconstruction.

The top of this technical pyramid is set bythe Information Synthesis Reactor\[12 \] construction. This is an instrument of an autonomic organism consciousness, which could be adjusted and connected with certain organisms body to give adequate, both linear and resonance-non-linear measurements and corrections. The Information Synthesis Reactor processor is physically-processing body model of a self-organized matter (substance) of the certain living organism. If this model is joined with living organism with body by physical exchange it will show bordering substance tunnel infrastructures. The measurements and knowledge compression are pulled into a compact self-organized nuclear similar to that as how a master paints his masterpiece by finding only possible outlines of harmonica forms, compositions and light. The compact nuclear sets a kind of quantum-tensor that works as spatial-time gyroscope showing gradients in the cycle-interval linear resonance-energetic revivals. In this way Fibonacci ratio and all of physical and mathematical constants, as general copmonents, are obtained.

The Internal Synergy-Resonance effect shows, that was called, insight of non-linear forms transformations, which brings descriptors of information. As result a matrix of physical geodesics would be found, space of control function interpretations would be found and critical correcting-control points - information would be found. From medical point of view the Universal Therapeutic Matrix to keep living functions regenerated would be found. The Information Reactor naturally includes both components, which belong to both von-Neumann algorithmic (also neuron-linguistic and quantum-computing ) conception and informational-resonance physics. This is functional-synergistic fundamental composition. Thats why such double principle construction is used in human brain construction. That is how brain and entire brain-neuron system works. The number of the synergistic-system determinations and constructive procedures gavethe Method of the Synergy-Quantum Control.

Physically the Method of the Synergy-Quantum Control identifies and forms all of its substance-functional structures in way, which gives maximum synergistic energy revival.This is principle formula of the synergistic control that gives measurements and holds its synergistic infrastructure. This is an organism root (stem, nuclear, core ) processing. In such way the Matrix of Synergistic Infrastructure is created. It defines and propels all of functions of sub-cells, cells and many levels symbiotic organisms, with a consciousness on the top, is determined as a selection of a manifold of a functional control structure with maximum energy revival of compact compression. Herewith, a compactness is controlled with knowledge logic and information synthesis-process of a consciousness. These procedures have spectrum-cluster mathematics and physical tools to get essential data. By using these instruments we could get a complete and analytic representation about normal and abnormal synergy function structure in terms of frequency bands and their focuses. This is an universal instrument to modulate any of physical and biochemical organism functions to be completely regenerative.

The limit of the completeness is determined with the expression:

Living time ( L )((structured energy E(|structure (R) = inertial projections and Transformations (T) of self-control) ==Information ( I )(compact structure transformations &gt; compact structured energy)|Synergistic Quantum Control (S) (E,I), U (V, C), lim L(U/S(E=I) = Lim \~/0 =\~| S(E x I = Q)

This means that living time of a self-organized (S) system, wich is seen with rational projections of inertial structure (R) and its dynamics (T), is defined by way (S), which sets relation between energy of structure transformations and information (I) that makes these transformations be belonging to the compact synergy quantum matter (body) (Q). If this relation is tend to E=I so, having open Universe (U) (continual (C) variety (V) of potential structuring), we have L=\~ (I used sign \~ as sign of endless). In particular case of a transition from the Newton to extra-Finslers Physics (extra-Finslers Physics is my definition of the Physics of spatial-time endless variations, which was actually outlined with the Finsler spaces ideas) we get the almost known of energy, mass, light speed relation E = I x m x C2 (C x C), where I - information that shows the relativity to the carrying proto-material quantum. This general expression is compressed into all of existing limited formal systems with partial symmetric and digital solutions. However it directly deployed into the Information Synthesis Technique with the whole regenerative constructions as result.

The reality of such living system arrangement is proved by the Nature.Any organism looks for ways to recognize and to follow its Synergy Matrix of universal and specific physicalQuantumcondition first and just then its Functional Matrix appeared, holded, developed and regenerated as a subordinated component.We can see these directly invisible microbiological experiments. The mitosis vs amitoses process experiments show how a cell, which skipped formation of spindle fibers and framing of chromosomes (synergistic control processor), looses it ability for the further dividing. This is direct manifestation of a Synergy-processor arrangement that forms a cell synergy infrastructure.

A biological cells dividing is caused by the reason of the boarding synergy quantum tunnel transitions. A biological cell forms a distance relatively an exhausted quantum position and vibrates looking for the synergistic maximum of energy revival. Two-level consciousness organism structuring extend space of such consciousness logical search into range of more complex-compressed logic. The population (including social) organisms extend this way. On contrary, cancer cells move from the two-level organization to the just conditional homogeneous feeding spaces by simplification their Synergy-Matrix and corresponding Functional Matrix.

Actually all of natural phenomena are based and show the synergon-process. We can see huge trees, which making their symmetrical roots-branch construction with all of functional center and peripheral units.This direct EM-light consuming is organised with branch-leaf antenna while roots restructiring feed trees functional body. This construction allow near thousand years of longevity. This is passive way of the space-time control.

Dimensional correlation with longevity is seen in animal world. The longevity is increasing with bigger body dimensions. The same biochemical process gives that difference just because dimensions. A different thermal energy management shows no difference in longevity because there are short living cold-blood snakes and 500-700 years living cold blood sharks. The same physical matter and the same biochemical processes give different living range. What do give them such abilities unless a more massive structure causes more synergistic energy revival?

But also they show an anabolism which is the way of body structure simplifying that makes it more universal in time transitions. This is thermal way of simplex-reproduction. Mushrooms and mold use another type of simplifications by spreading with spores. Animals and human beeing sperm reproduction is also way of simplex-reproduction. However it based on synergon-nuclear propagation that demands a dialectic joint couple to be activated vs the whole cold body time transition. However a human being is able to use a synergon technological shell to expand its living time with both inherited body and nuclear propagation in process of the complete regeneration. The first stage of the body metric agreement will definitely give longevity not less that this 500-700 that are shown with other living creatures. This is the prospect of 1-2 years in a pilot project.

The Synergy Quantum Control Method introduces itsthe Instrumental Universal Regenerative Methodthat gives the Universal Regenerative Medicine naturally. This is a therapy that is based on Synergy Matrix measurements and diagnostics vs regeneration that is based on Functional Matrix forms and manipulations with them. Genetics engineering and stems cells regenerating \[38-45\] methods give another proof about the space-structure recognizing of the Synergon-machine inside of a living organism. However so called genome map shows just about 1.5 % of DNA based genetic code as useful. Everything else is treated as service markers or trash. There are other suggestions. However the point is that the unique trash code sooner carries ( as unique code of Iris or skin prints) the most precious data about personal body physical matter and could become the most important information in Synergon-projections.

The genetics engineering should be enhanced with Synergy Quantum method and technique. The synergy-informational way would give the certain organism complete regeneration. That means also that such diseases as Aging, Cancer, Alzheimers and similar diseases, including mental diseases, immune system diseases etc. will be understood and treated completely because their Synergy System specifics. The specifics of these diseases is that all of them are diseases of violations in self-identifying measurements and corresponding restructuring. If having a Synergy Quantum Control instruments we could identify and treat these diseases precisely and completely by diagnosing and affecting on these systems abnormalities.The instruments of the Synergy-Quantum Regenerative method set its technical Platform. Lets consider how exactly the Instrumental Universal Regenerative Method will identify and treat the mortal diseases.

The Complete Regenerative Medicine Against  Aging and Other MortalDiseases

Lets consider an aging.An aging is a Synergistic Quantum discoordination all of an entire body structures and processes including its intro-cellular nucleolus-matrix structured medium, entire matrix-skeleton and connecting tissues also brain and nerves tissue also metabolic, location and dynamics control organs also system organs and processes of a stem cell-based differentiating and cells dividing also stem-cells generative organs and depots, blood metabolic and matrix control generating apparatus, brain-nerves apparatus, humoral apparatus, immune apparatus components. And this is a matter of the Synergy-Autonomic Control. An aging is a Synergy-Quantum deficit process because distractions cant be fixed with internal functional logic of a closed in that organism. Its Synergistic synthetic function is not sufficient. So a human body just depletes its meta-quantum space by the cell dividing. This gives first an exponential grows then an exponential declination with collapsing functional conflicts on this road.

A human body evolution confirms this fact and this direction of their development. Thats why its brain-nerves infrastructure has an architecture of the tunnel Synergy-Quantum control. And a brain potential much exceed just regular function control needs. There are known cases of the normal organism functioning even a part of brain was absent. It means that a brain evolution that is not finished yet and the Synergy-Quantum Control is its goal.

The human living could be endless and immortal in principle. Lets see that the chemical substance exists in endless transformations, cancer cell can divide itself endlessly and immortal jellyfish can reproduce itself by disassembling into polips etc. The metamorphosis and biological regeneration are performed as fundamental process. So id self-organizing organism will manage own synergy it could be extended in this quality. Such in principle complete organisms could swim smoothly in endless quantum pool of the Universe in adequate controlled metamorphosis. They could meet each others in common worlds and be tunnel-separated in prognoses transformations out of the horror of a death. The birth and human love still would available giving new wolds alleys but death would be substituted with a world extensions and parallel worlds tunneling. It is constructively possible now under the next conditions:

1. A human brain got an constructive idea about Synergy-Quantum structuring thus structured in this way.

2. Synergy-Quantum Autonomous Control Technical Shell (that saving universal ship) would be constructed.

And this constructive plan is discussed in the article. It could be embed for the next few year.

The technique of an aging prevention or an aging reversing until best dody form includes the next two techniques. The first one is the technique of the individual physical substance and individual Synergy-Quantum infrastructure Matrix explicating. The second one is the technique of the either synergy-packed frequency direct energetic or SM-modulated generalized influences or an engineering (mechanical, SM-modulated mechanical, ray-EM, chemical of biochemical etc).

The linear component of the Synergy-Matrix explicating is available now.The unique part of a genome DNA code, its physical morphology, special electrical and EM probes, also body tissue structure including iris and skin prints give the precious data that could be proceed with an algorithm to give the person its life-saving matrix. There is not principle matter about the processing techniques but processing dimensions and processing effectiveness \[94-137\]. The DNA code cluster compression could based on computational abilities of contemporary computing servers.

The special Synergy Matrix basedResonance Mosaic Generator(special assembly of generators) will correct an aging process radically. It is expected that Hayflick limit of cells dividing will be overcome and telomerase will repar internal cells clocks due to sufficient energy revival. Probably all of the organism memoris infrastructure renewed. Stem cells and system as well B-lymphocytes will be renewed. In this reason a human body will get a regenerated organs and smooth young skin. Considering mentioned nature longevity phenomena a human being longevity probably will be extended at least in 8-10 times. These are results of the next few years of the proper work upon this approach.

Afterthe Synergistic QuantumInformationReactorwill be constructed the non-linear part of Synergistic Matrix will be added. All technical means will set a personal regenerative channel. To build such a channel as personal regenerative shell and enhance its abilities will be the main human goal and criteria of its success.

When saying about that super-longevity the questions about an overflow of population should be answered. Indeed, there are no reasons to speak about an overflow of population and lack of the Earth resources because this mistake of non-adequate physical world realizing. More population is more integrated power of more parallel physical space vision. This vision will discover tunnels that are not so resource-destructive as space flights. They will give distances of informational vs energetic touches. Informational vision lens gives the real unlimited world

This is the fact that the Universe are continuously solid and continuously diversified. Regular vision and regular knowledge, even the so much developed, cant explain world so they give wrong picture of the reality. The astrophysics black holes, which absorb material and big bangs, by which this materia is given happen not somewhere there but in every emptiness of our instrumental vision. They are between each, even the least partial, components of our body

The functional instruments give just partial projection. The reality is no in such projections. The reality is the following down synergy-tunnel tangents. Everything depends of ability to predict and control own synergistic infrastructure adequacy. This is the Information Synthesis process, which must be managed by humanity.That is the mainchallengeand the main goal of humanity to be free and secured in all of humans specifics.

As concearns a cancer.A cancer is a Synergy Matrix and the Synergon-process to be restructured in way that makes separate organism of separate cell come to a conclusion (body cell has own consciousness - measurements of its special physical matter structure and making autonomous logic around that) about that cell gets an energy revival better separately than being in integral organism.

Different factors and their combinations could play their roles. Anyway as result such cells will activate a telamerase renewing cycle and starts a yeast-similar energetic process with logic to fight with entire organism immune system. What keeps this process going? The Synergy Matrix simplification into simply-feeding side. What could bring cancer cel back? Synergy profiled energy revival or exact Information Synthesis process based engineering. These approaches were discussed above.

Alzheimers disease is diagnosed now just by secondary indicators of a brain functional destruction. Indeed this diseses happens not because sclerotic calcium deposits or wrong structured protein tissue are grown. On contrary, that  happens because brain as the specific organ gives wrong of  a current moment organisms Synergy Matrix. What is the difference this entity comparing with an aging and a cancer? The Synergy Control process is damaged not inside of a cell. It is damaged in the organ, which provide  an entire organism with Synergy Matrix. Accordingly the Quantum Resonance Mosaic Generator shoud be adjusted for its structures.

The frequancy based method is  really effective. Just recenly the University of Queensland has published results about ultra-sound effects on the Alzheimers disease. The ultrasound waves oscillate tremendously quickly, activating microglial cells that digest and remove the amyloid plaques that destroy brain synapses, explained Jrgen Gtz. The word breakthrough is often mis-used, but in this case I think this really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this disease, and I foresee a great future for this approach. \[72\].

Im afraid that the history with Raif-machnine is come back. The separate frequency effect could be turned into the medical method by many years of statistical trials or even criticized and forgotten. The key to the complete success is in the Synergon-machine. This complex of technical means, which provides a Synegy-Quantum Autonomic Control will give the whole matrix of corrections to reach the goal. This will be the solution.

The Technology Construction

The nuclear of the Synergy-Quntun Regenerating Technology is the Information Synthesis Reactor.This is flexible structured machine that gives the models that work both as generative symbol images and physical mediums. They are compressed in the way that give information - the direction about current compact control action of a self-organizing. It could be imaged as a digital, nuron-flexible or 3-positions quantum computers, that are organized under the Synergon control. In difference from digital bits or neuron-logical operations or quantum computer qubits-operations the Information Reactor basic elements (echobits-operations \[12\] ) is formed as flexible formed compact structures that are formed with Synergy-Resonance processes that are measured and deplyed in a physical medium. Echobits compositions and decompositions give the formal meta-models that are further processed in digital, neural or 3-position quantum-computing way.

This is the base of any of living organism consciousness as own physical matter and a synergistic specificity self-recognizing processor. Ive called this device reactor because it creates sensors of physical matter, which react showing a tissue of physical proto-material. It creates self-control models with components, which are organized to get an external energy revival that is measured and controlled externally. It happens because its inertial components are pulled together synergistically. The components and components of components give actual self-control model. Being in physical connection with human body it becomes part ot its processing giving data and information about its Synergistic Matrix and corrections.

The natural analogue of such reactor is those (right) part of a human brain, which gives insight of a suddenly vision of a solution often when sleeping. And a sleeping itself is a vortex-Vulcan-reordering process when the current knowledge mess is pulled into an organism Regenerative Matrix sensations order. Thats why an organism cant exist without sleeping (sometimes not sleeping is sleeping is spread mood sleeping substitute indeed).

The Information Reactor is device of knowledge and sygnals images compressing into the compact models that give the Synergy Resonance effects. They show Synergy-Quantum alternatives and critical transitions of an organism extension. The critical organism transition is synergistic structures that start chains of a self-regeneration. Its compact form thatintroduces an information (vsknowledgeorcommunicationdata and controlsignals) about self-organizing alternatives. Aninformationis compact-key physical structures, which bring an organism a compact structure component, which being merged into a currentprocessingautomaton, leads it to a compact self-organized form. Beingrefinedfrom heavyconnections(compact) an information is the most energetically movable matter while its integrative production consumes the most energy (the human brain consumes about 25% all of an organism energy). The compact models gives current organism meta-logic, architectural geodesics,decompositionand their metrics that are called above as an organism infrastructure.

The Information Reactor gives non-linear, which is come from proto-material non-linear synergy-Quantum material process. The last gives decompositions into the currents processing automaton control as a direction for direct energetic or (and) intermediate mechanical, physio-therapeutic, biochemical engineering. These are the particular logic of particular subordinated automaton that are well managed by functional Cybernetic math. These logic are processed with left half-sphere of the Information Reactor. Thats why the Information Reactor architecture includes that right-left, central and channeling (all organism parts connected) components. The similar form of the architecture is seen in human brain construction.

The left half-sphere (Cybernetic brain) of the Information Reactor gives the Synergy Matrix approximations as much adequate as they are controlled with the right halph-sphere. It performed according to data about the Synergy Matrix with cybernetics methods and processors. Thats why this part of the Information Reactor could be reconstructed fast.

The principle questions about processing dimensions, energy supply-energy exchange and constructing element base are resolved with nano-demsional and many-layers processing technologies of 5-25 nm level of discreetness \[ [http://www.itrs2.net/](http://www.itrs2.net/) \]. Their dimensions will secure a compact - informational-compressed process of self-control. The Information Synthesis process gives the synergy-quantum ratio between inertial memory of control operations and a synergistic quantum saturation, which should be compressed to break an entropy. This happens in the living nature as fact. The natural numbers of such compression are the next.

The The Universe visible barion discreetness is evaluated as3,28 in degree of 80. \[132\].However as the fact these space is compressed just with from 25 000 (human being) vs 22 000 (helmints) chromosones in bilocical cells. About 99% genes of human being and a mouse is the same or similar. Almost the same number 2.9 x 1000 000 000 for human being and about 2. 5 x 1000 000 000 for amouse nucleated couples code these organisms genome \[133\].The number of descrette processing compomemts (neurons) of a different living organisms is in range from 100 000 (fly) till 86 000 000 000 (human being) \[135\] Cats and elephants have acordingly 1 000 000 000 and 23 000 000 000 neurons. However, not these numbers determine the compressing ability.

The invariant synergistic infrastructure forms those compression, which makes organisms more or less smarter and developed. In spite of the current neuro-scince cant answer question why and how a brain are folded the Synergy-Quantum theory basics introduces the invariant process, which gives the Information Synthesis Resonance folding form and its meta-logic all of the consciousness control. It sets a lens and a compression which sees and compress the whole Universe into the pragmatical reality.

The Information Synthesis Reactor processing space is space that is formed with active resonance-compressing elements. They form compact space neighborhoods compressing balkness into compactness. Thats why the human brain could process so mach data with so small parts into the solutions. This is flexible process, which is constructed with with flexibly-connected echo-parts (echobits) of invariant structure \[12\]. Thats why all of biological neurons should be considered not just as communication elements but elementary and complex physical resonance sensors that tends to give an integral synergistic maximum in concentrated structuring. The resonance-synergistic cluster compression \[12\] is the way of the Information reactor functioning. This is the essence of a living process control. This infrastructure are reveled in clusters (echoclusters) of each body specific physical matter that would be recognized and operated in the Information Reactor processing.

The information Synthesis Reactor resolves the main problem of the transition from the endless living matter and its population worlds with separated consciousness in into the living matter and its population worlds of complete individual consciousness that are secured and equivalent to the their endless extension.

The Information Reactor give an adequate control plan which is embed with automate of its inertial decomposition. They form affecting techniques. The technique of direct energetic corrections forms a device that Ive called as the Quantum-Resonance Mosaic Generator (Corrector). Its functioning and applications were discussed above, Alltorgather these mean will form those centers and channels that will bring a complete regenerative process for each of human being body.

In terms of technological progress this techniques will set the Synergy Quantum Autonomic Regenerating Platform. This will be the Synergon-machines platform. Probaly it will be called as the platform 5.0 Platform to differ from current technique protocols.

The principal solution and available technical base suppose two parallel lines of that construction. The first of these lines is line of the linear Synergy control means construction. It based on existing technologies, which would be integrated under supervision of the Synergy control machine. The DNA code universal and specific morphological and numeral bio-codification, body tissue, including skeleton tissues, Iris and skin individual prints, body proportions also direct current, impulse and alternative electrical current body response also ultrasound echo also light, UV, XR probes will give the Synergy Matrix data, which could be measured and processed with algorithms on the computing machines of von-Neamann, neuro-nets or quantum-computing types. As result an individual body physical substance static model will be gotten. This means that a medical diagnostics and all medical influences could be exactly profiled with certain body physical substance Synergy Matrix structure. The result could be compared with a skyscraper building according to construction plan vs mechanical mix of different materials. The pilot pattern of the main instrument of the direct regenerative process (Quantum-Resonance Mosaic Corrector) could be constructed and all of therapeutic actions could be started for about one-year of the works.The second line supposes the whole Information Reactor Construction as was mentioned above.

Lets Construct an Adequate Reality and Resolve the Human Problems

Actually the humanity has no another reasonable alternative unless to resolve that holistic systems Synergy-Quantum Autonomous control problem. The self-organized thus Synergy-Quantum Autonomous controlled physical matter is only the beginning and the determination all of existing. This is the sense, the method and the goal of the human being progress. This is the final choise of an evolution or a creation. Otherwise each human being will die in each helpless human life so miserable as millions years ago and the entire humanity will be collapsed early or later. 

There is nothing pragmatical in anything else. All of other human goals are just illusions because even the most high human achievements and hopes are doomed to a death. The sophisticated patches and couple tens more longevity in wheelchairs does not set a difference. However that human collapse is not predicted indeed because a life as entity is endless and regeneration phenomenon is proved. The certain specific life is always collapsed due to wrong paradigm, which does not allow seeing a certain life being in the Synergy-Quantum permanently self-controlled process. No other approach gives a solution.

Lets recall the past 60-th, when the cybernetics and genetics expectations were very high. Cancer diseases were seemed almost defeated. Magazines and TV told e.g. about immune system signaling chains with interlakin-2 control, which promised the real victory the next time. Alas, 60 years later we still there hoping in new scientific-technological progress. Having so much more powerful and sophisticated technique the human being is still helpless because still it is stubborn in following the pragmatics of a partial relativity. 

However already Werner Heisenberg \[137\] showed the principle, which stated about the relativity of separated measurements is not resolved giving uncertainty. The same conclusion was given with K. Gedels theorem about incompleteness of formal systems in fundamental mathematics. The humanity waists its time and other resources in vain just destroying the environment because this substitutes of the Synergy-Quantum reality with mystics of casual or pseudo-scientific believes. The Universe and its physical mater are self-organized. The self-organizing has its invariant  technique. This technique is rationally identified and synthesis-informationally functioned. It should be constructed. Such is the fundamental compact solution.

Our ancestors saw the Earth as a plate that is placed on the back of a mythic turtle and stars are nailed to the sky fabric and the Earth was considered as a center of the Universe etc. And now, in spite of all of methodical and technical developments our life is still fulfilled with non-adequate believes and surrogates and our life is the same way collapsing and non-predictable as millions years ago. Only having the Synergy-Quantum Autonomic Control instruments this hopeless situation could be fixed radically. Its critical time to get rid from mystics and resolve the whole problem constructively. 

What could be done right now to get rid from Aging, Cancer, Alzheimers, Similar and Other Diseases by Getting the Platform of the Universal Regenerative Method?

1. The pilot platform of the Quantum-Frequency Mosaic Processor with Alpha (A) processor of A+jW process and W heuristic control could be constructed for about one year because it demands just a programming.

2. Under the SQM-method supervising the DNA code structure, tissue structure, Iris and skin prints, electrical and sounds echoes data structures could be measured by existing instrumental methods and the pilot technique of the control could be done.

3. The measurements data could be cluster-compressed and the SQM of certain organisms body will be gotten.

4. The SQM-aberrations could be detected

5. A direct frequency Synergy Matrix bundle and Synergy Matrix modulated bio-chemistry regenerative plan could be taken and ready for experiments according to the FDA demands.

6. The Information Synthesis Reactor A+jW process constructing will be started and accomplished for about 5 years.

7. Personal regenerative channels will be started as a) experimental one according to the FDA demands b) as personal reliable safe deposit of the most precious proto-informational body data about the individual body SQM both for   a current medical practice support and the regeneration prospect start c) as a technical polygon, for about one year 

And this (1-7) actions are the best pragmatical goal for everybody who treat themselves not as a chemical stuff and temporary biological splash but really homo sapiens who is owning the sense, method and process the body self-control. Just few talented constructors of the proper knowledge and skills could construct another future with starting for all of the humanity avalanche-like regenerative process of the endless world. Such a few price vs scale of the accomplishment. 

The humanity stays in one step from the own Information-Regenerative alternative. The is the platform of the new complete antranthropocentric (organistic) society with goals and values of real freedom, which having sufficient choices to be synergistic protected. This is the transition from simplified-illusions world with pragmatics and criteria of a death to world of the compact-divers into endless physical reality. 

The reality is not products and pleasures of a consuming. That is not a nirvana of smoking. The endless reality is not TV watching and it is not phone and Internet communications. The endless reality are not flights to the Mars even all of that give the progress in techniques and spaces. The endless reality is myriads stars and the symmetrically mount of particles that are compressed into solid compact physical matter of our and each other specific body by means of the Synergon Lens. The Information Reactor, the Mosaic Generators and personal Regenerative channels should superstructure all of centers and nets of existing productions and regular services to give this Synergon-completely secured future. 

This is the platform and productions of the organistic (Informationally-symbiotic) society that should naturally come instead authoritarian, totalitarian, socialists or ochlocratic pseudo-democratic surrogates. All of these outdated social buildings were based on the subjective authoritarian or social-inflicted plans. The democratic progress was as helpful as good the humans cultures were developed. The pseudo-democratic appeals to the less competent major part of the society by voting gives wrong control in principle. The constitutional power dividing and constitution statements always are not complete and do not guarantee a right government. 

The market gave the only objective regulation. However it works with mass-statistic process and intermediate indicators. The money-universal exchange is the compelled way by the conditions that exact individual features of the consuming and certain production cant be measured, described and interconnected. There were the fundamental and technological limitations, which conditioned that stage.

Foreword

Todays human pragmatics is senseless and always leading to a death because of not-completeness of scientific, particularly physical, medical and social, foundations. The Synergy-Quantum Autonomous Control is the main missing link. This article is the road-map of the method and the technique of the Information Synthesis based Autonomous Control as a filling of those fundamental scientific gap, which does not allow a human body and its consciousness collapse to be prevented. The method is introduced as such needed filling and the constructive procedural plan. The main in it are compact determinations, the procedures that give synergistic metrics and complete (universal) infrastructure of the Main Control Invariant with the Information Synthesis procedure (a consciousness technique) on the top. These give the synergistic instruments of the technical constructing for an aging and death to be prevented (treated) not by illusions or with magic wand but in principle on practice. It would mean the complete regenerative medicine as the technique of the individual permanent modelling and an individual body Synergistic Matrix based regenerating. These instruments will set the compact regenerative channels and personally secured self-control nets that are placed above all of techniques and productions of the society. This approach concerns as biological sub-cells, cells, entire body and social integration in organismic (organistic) symbiotic systems. As social plan it gives a technological platform to manage resources, natural disasters and social conflicts adequately by means of an agreement of  extending invariant-organistic models. In this way built  organistic society would treat each of its member as a goal and necessary resource of mutual extension in the endless nature space. So this article is also a plan of, an organistic in principle and symbiotic in pragmatics, self-organized society. Thus, this is about the synergistic way of the conceptually and technically secured endless human living and the society arrangement that puts these method and means into the base of its organistic institutions. This is the whole program. Always young body and the motivated super-high technological solidarity instead  temporary patches, destructions, desperation and a tragic fate. These could be done for the next few years. That is what this article about.

Introduction

The physical matter and living bodies are self-organized as local or continual separations of the Universe. This is the only possible fundamental scientific position and it could be developed completely up to perfection and constructively proved. The universalities and specificities, which are revealed in fundamental physics of the past experience with such entities as physical condensed and field spread matter, gravitation vs magnetism, superconductivity, quantum entanglement \[1,2\] etc., also in mathematical models and, even in gaps of their theoretical formalizations \[3, 4\] also in different kind of data of the chemistry, biology, including bio-genetics, astrophysics etc. are explained, agreed and resolved only under condition that they are built in a constructive sense of a technology of the self-organized Universe. This is the base of a living matter and its subjective consciousness-based organism arrangement. Constructively it is a subject of the complete fundamental Control (Management) Science. However the Control Science evolution still is not complete and that is the reason of the conventional non-adequate human paradigm. This is the only reason all of antagonisms, disasters and collapses. However all of these dreadful mess are not predetermined with the Universal Nature that is endless in its continual variety.

So the material self-organizing control completion is the Main fundamental = Main utilitarian task of an adequate existence, which is potentially infinite, because the Universe is infinite. Actually the developed human knowledge and processing technique are close to the solution. However the major of human being still are built into the logic to die in experimental selections instead to predict and to expand a living tunnel of its continuously-diversespace-time alternatives. 

This article introduces the whole plan. It revises and make compact-constructive such fundamental determinations as a physical and formal matter, energy, space-time, metrics, logics, function, automaton, system, synergy, information, autonomy, adequacy, consciousness, harmony, pragmatics, perfection, completeness by giving their complete-constructive sense and performing technique etc. The article shows the principles and a construction plan of that control sciences and technique completion to rule out the everyday coming catastrophic problems in their roots, in a regular practice and as the Paradigm of the Completeness (Perfection)\[6-13\].

&amp;#x200B;

The Conceptual Solution

The catastrophic human bodys and human surroundings problems are problems of the holistic-system nature and any temptation of decomposing them into parts mechanically gives just endless variety of interpretations instead of a focused - compact solution. Such holistic (system, synergistic) approach it was often proclaimed but never resolved in principle before. The article, introduces the constructive synergistic solution to resolve the problem of a human catastrophe in principle completely that means the next:

1. There is a principle solution as a constructive procedural plan of the complete self-organizing Autonomous Control. It determines open self-organized systems (organisms) universal infrastructure that sets the main and around rational invariants and their A+jW dual, A (alpha) - inertial and W (omega) - non-linear informational process of the self-control. These suppose a particular for each system physical matter and energy recognition in quanta of their objective physics. The synergistic quanta vs inertia is the source of the system metrics. It gives the meta-formal j-part of the process, which includes a synergistic censoring of informational interconnections between a physical substance and its energy transformations relatively to a quantum enclosed inertial memory.

The Synergistic means structured with a quantum-given self-organizing frame and this quantum meta-structure recognizing is the basic Synergistic (self-organizing) open system function. The Synergistic function recognizes itself as some invariant infrastructure that is compact in looking for its objective space of its inertia. This is a recursive function with j-component of non-linear transitions. It is performed by the Information Synthesis. The information Sythesis is a base of a consciousness. An information shows connections from a current to the future also give a track of a consciousness memory. A system order that is based on synergistic infrastructure gives a Synergistic System. The synergistic structure internal relative transformations (dynamics) give internal process, its relative ratio and functions in internal time to be mutual calibrated. Different synergistic structures and processes are interfered each other but never intersected in invariant infrastructures. They universally similar but specifically objective (physically) embedded. This is the condition of an existing and an interacting of Synergistic Systems. The synergistic interference could be agreed, conflict and conditionally neutral.

The system structuring is naturally split into the dialectical types of the whole Synergistic (Condensed, Clarified, Revealed as going from some objective physical matter focus) Functional and Inertial Functional structuring. Synergistic Functional structuring (further word functional will be often omitted in reason to dont mix up with inertial functions) seeks to be compact within the Synergy System (shows such objective physical matter focus structure) integration. Synergy features reflect an objective physical matters infrastructure that gives the Signature (structural and procedural descriptors) and Functional self-organizing process. The Inertial Functional (further will be often called as Functional) self-organizing process takes that Synergistic features as subjective features of invariants of a self-organizing to keep this subjectivity.

A Synergy System is a system that is based on objectively given quantum-subjective forms of its structure initiation. Objective means structuring from focus-inertia that carries a subjective plurality. This focus-inertia introduces a quantum arrangement of a physical material. A functional structuring reflects dynamics of plural subjective choices of the Synergy System inertia extension. The functional structuring is a time-structure transformative mobility (dynamics) both of focus-structured essence that is treated as physical Matter (physical inertial substance and fields), and its transformative potentials, which are treated as an Energy.

The Matter and Energy is objectively-subjectively jointed with information about their time ordered prospect. A subjectivity is embedded with a Consciousness construction. The Consciousness is a primary objectively given, developed or introduced subjective formed superstructure, which recognizes and gives a Synergy Systems choices of a self-organizing restructuring. These choices could be either subjectively linear-limited or Adequate (Compact-Harmonic up to Complete Harmonic). It has universal harmonic base that gives informational fillings that are brought by the Internal System Resonance. The Internal System Resonance is harmonic effect of an interrelation between system-focused and time-linear structuring. The harmonic matching gives maximum time (=energy revival) of an existing. The Consciousness is an organistic (in a sense of living systems constructing) technique (material instrument) of adjustments of an internal resonance Harmony.

The Consciousness is based on the constructive InformationSynthesis procedure. A Harmony is a information-resonance constructive condition of the Autonomic Automaton Systems Control. When we hear a nice music or enjoy colors or experience a sexual orgasm we are affected with the internal synergistic resonance sensations. This is the reason of so much pleasure we feel. Those that are recognized in aesthetics or sexual attraction indeed are the internal Synergy-System infrastructure response in a limited or a complete progress. The process of knowledge compression to get the System Resonance introduces the Information Synthesis Process and Information as a compact physical matter that connects chains of a actual systems harmonic time order. 

2. There are the technical means and a technological base, which allow this solution to be constructed in certain (the first stage for about one year and second stage for about 5 years) time.

My answer is positive.We can construct this now.And that is what this article is about.

TheBeginningsof the Foundations

Do you think that your body consists of the same physical and chemical components as abody of another living creature? This is wrong. Even water (60-90% of a body mass) in your body is different. And a body does not consist of the physical and chemical matter at all. It locates (reveals, manifests, detects) the certain physical and chemical substance by fact of its birth and a living process. The periodical systems  of parts appear in result of the human expirience mutual agreemet. Thats why a living body is different comparing with any mechanical composition. A living body reveals its own individual-matter physics. That is the answer on the main scientific question what is difference between living and non-living matter and how they are organized.

This each time unique revelations of each different body has the universal base that could be formally (linearly, mechanistically) recognized and reproduced giving start of the new living lines. The Mechanism does not determine the compact structure as a static form (formal system \[14\] ) but determines the process, which gives an information about a compact structure that could be measured in variety of objective selections. The subjective invariant based track of this objective selections determines a subjectivity. This mechanism of the substance structure revelation shoud be discovered first before any critical action, especially medical treatment, could be specified in terms of any, even very sophisticated medical knowledge.

The problem ofAutonomousControl (Autonomic Control) was actually raised and considered in frame of theInvariancy Problemstudy inAutonomousControl science \[14-17\]. The problem of Invariancy is problem of regulation that keeps some primary regulation to be independent from some external (relatively this primary control) disturbances (distractions). This problem is directly corresponded with medical problem of Homeostasis \[19,20\] that means a process, which secures an organism to be kept it normal functional form. However that normal functional form is indeed Synergy System organized and different for each organism so Homeostasis approach, as being a functional-generalized one, cant recognize and manage its originating specifics.

The problem of the of Autonomous Control was partially resolved as an engineer method of approximations that gives a balance in complex linear (quasi-liniar) dynamic-parametric (functional) interrelations. Especially fundamentally important is the Fourier analysis \[18\], which gives a harmonic-spectrum compression of the whole in quantum-exponential time projections. However nowhere it was formulated and resolved the problem of open systems autonomacy of the real world (class of living systems). And now this main sphere is managed by just different kind of knowledge logics and their heuristics. Because they are is not based on universal platform (invariant base) so they cant resolve the Problem of Autonomacy in principle. The Autonomacy solution cant belong to both heuristic or closed formal system. However it can be described in principles, architecture structures and procedures of the universal (invariant) construction. And just this construction makes mathimatics and physics complete and adequate as based on the universal self-organizing control. That what I mean referring to the complete Autonomic Control Science.

What is wrong in the science, mathematical science \[4\], physical science, medical science, which are not allowing to get over 0-100 years of usual human longevity range and pushing us to live in variety of catastrophes and mortal diseases including an aging, cancer, Alzheimers, similar and other diseases?The only reason is absence of theprincipallycomplete fundamental physical model of self-organised matter that includes consciousness on its top.

All of models of knowledge and practices that are used now in the science and applications are partial, secondary-intermediary, non-compact, non-adequate, so in principle, limited. In the same time the sum of the contemporary knowledge and operational techniques allow recognotion the complete-compact physical model as a consummation of the fundamental base of the Autonomic System Control Science. The control scienceuniversality, as a basic line of any knowledge, was accented by Norbert Wiener in hisCybernetics\[21,22\]. Really, everything that goes and happens in our life is a realizing of actual and potential internal and external distractions also potentials to find ways to give a responsive by taking actions to keep our system being living.

These ways could be ascomplete and perfect as our realizing and responsive technique is. They could be functional-reflexive and mechanistic. It could be a goal-reaching and operating with knowledge. It could be even similarity-reproductive ones. However anyway, all of these are not enough to give a living system (organism), which is performed with autonomic consciousness that is a control on base of subjective-individual invariants. The Invariants keep both the inertial-rational and non-linear predicted compact descriptions about a universality and an individuality, which can not be lost to keep an organism alive. The point is that principles and apparatus of such invariants forming are universal.And they suppose the Information Synthesis process. And this is the key to the whole problem. 

An organism recognizes its unique physical matter and its logical invariants as itself in each cycle of its existing and transfers or reproduces this representation (vs just similarity) by means of producing of an information (vs just data) about that realizing. On this place (system autonomic completeness) the Cybernetics was stuck (even in robotics and artificial intelligence) giving way to either systems \[23\] and synergistics \[24-30\] and informational \[31-36\] approaches. All of these terms belong to the same Synergy System entity that was not resolved with compact specific determinations, balances of rationality, criteria and procedures.And this is the main human gap that causes all of problems of hopeless around.

Indeed, Synergistic-information entities are described in rational determinations, principles and procedures \[12\]. They could be put into rational techniques giving a superstructure above the Cybernetics. That would be Information-Consciousness managed systems construction. The complete organistic construction to get and adequate technical embrace (shell) of personal or social organisms for the endless regenerative living could be obviously expected. If these phenomena exist in wild nature why it could not be managed by homo sapiences technique?

The superstructure would give an operational platform of a substance compact structuring and adequate transformations in that self-organizing control, which is led with an information.An Information is somecondensedmaterial pointers onto structured energy (compact trans-structure) process that gives the next cycle of a system synergisticintegrityin a self-organizing control.In medical applications of such process is calleda Regeneration\[37-44\]. This supposes a self-realizing of its universal and specific physics in measurements, knowledge logic and processing functions. The instruments of such organistic information based self-organizing control give aComplete Regeneration Platform.

This platform could be called either systems, or synergistics or synthesis-informational one. However objective side of the key solution is going from the Quantum nature of the Universe. The Universe is woven with both universally and particularly twinkled-intersected (proto-matter - matter dual interaction) Synergistic Quanta.The Synergistic Quantum is an objective space-time condensations that bring a system synergistic inertial structuringand all of its system control functions including informational ones (the last one shows actually system regeneration alternatives). This structuring is reflected with a Synergistic Quantum Model and is managed with a Synergistic (Universal) Regeneration Platform.

The principles, metrics, procedures and technique of this synergy quantum control forms the fundamentalSynergistic Quantum Model (SQ-model), which explains and rules all of entities of the Nature. It introduces an adequate control of any application. This gives the Completeness (Perfection) Informational Paradigm.This information based Synergistic Quantum Paradigm would change the way of human living by means of compressing all of knowledge and productions intoindividualcompact-adequate technique channels with all of a humans being or social applications adequate integration.The processings and communications centers and nets will establish the organistic infrastructure of the perfect social organism. That would be completely different way of an existing in a harmony without of collapses and catastrophes.

The platform of that paradigm would allow the world to be seen compactly. It means compressed with informational lens, wich both the First Fundamental Level of self-organized physic matter and the Second Fundamental Level of self-organized consciousness without being drown in np-fullness of informational burst of endless interpretations and experimental errors. This would prevent mess of incomprehension, bulkiness and errors of rough and squandering personal and social experiments. The world around would be finally considered not as particles, stars and planets as result of simplified instrumental projections but as continuum of tunnel condensations and unlimited prospects of informational-assembled self-organized systems. The fragile tissue of a human life should be based not on primitiv  mystics and selfishness but on the technical compression of unlimited constructive-harmonic growing. Only having such platform we could combine all of special knowledge and techniques to get a Complete Regenerative Way of our living. And this goal are reachable now in a practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Instrumental Part of the Conceptual Solution

Lets consider an Aging, Cancer, Alzheimers and similar diseases. What is a common for the listed diseases besides the next: a) official science and practical medicine cant cure their specifics so use just rough and just supportive methods b) these are the mortal diseases? These are diseases of a lost of a living organism Systems Autonomic Control. This is about that mentioned cybernetics superstructure (synergistics).

The Systems Autonomic Control is the main-(re)generative mechanismthat is located in body of cells \[11, 37\] and of an entire organism. This is the mechanism of self-determination in universality and absolutely unique specificity of each of body substance and its structures. It gives a root regenerative integrity with synergistic (the First Level of an Integrity) and symbiotic (the Second Level of an Integrity) structuring of its components. All of basic sub-cells, cells, organ-constructive, consciousness and entire organism initiation-processing functions are explained and identified just in that structuring. Only after such self-determination structuring (synergistic control) is determined the functions of stabilizing and adjustments (cybernetics limited control), which are known in genetics, metabolic and signalling chains, are appeared.

If that synergistic structuring is broken a functional control is interpreted or dispersed in form of a cancer, aging, Alzheimers and similar diseases. Actually, the synergistic mechanism determines anInfrastructureof the real physical matter that allowing an organism assembling. Technically it is expressed withSynergistic Matrix, which assembles and rules the whole organism.This is the only synergistic place,where the listed diseases are appeared, identified, measured and treated indeed.Nothing could be done completely and successfully unless that mechanism are understood and managed. I called this mechanism asSynergy Quantum Control (SQ-control).This is the Synergy-Quantum Matrix (SQM) with The Information Sythesis base control.The Synergistic Quantum Control is performed in each living processing. This is root of an organism consciousness process as the material way of physical universal and specific Synergy Quantum System self-recognizingon the second floor of a system control structuring.

Generally Quantum appearance are known in terms of the Quantum Physics \[46-54\] as invariant-formed portion of continually-discrete medium in entities of EM fields and nuclear physics. The M. Planks constant of particles energy or EM waves concentration gives some clue and number about such an invariancy. However, a quantum is self-sufficient entity because it is born to exist in corresponding time linearity (inertia) until either to be dispersed or to be built into a tunnel extension. This self-sufficiency is printed in its structure and its transformations (actually both of them are inseparable and should be considered as trans-structure) and carries features of universal mater infrastructure. Physically this print carries features of generating matter (Proto-Matter) that is not instrumentally seen directly but could be predicted by linear integrity. In such way it could be measured. Its similar to as sky bodies are predicted by seeing other bodies movement deviations. We can read these prints and we can compress them into the knowledge to construct the whole sensors.

If it is being predicted, measured and merged into actual knowledge about body functionality (which are their non-complete relative projections) these universal-specific infrastructure would give anessentiallinearand non-linear fillings in form of informationabout an organism regeneration as an alternative of a self-organized matter structuring. This is the principally synthetic way of the holistic body identification and control. This is the sense all of so called holistic approaches. This is a sense of a synergistic quantum = informational = adequate-individual body identification (modelling). So the main question is what is the Universal Quantum Infrastructure that could bring both just mechanical Newtons inertia and could give information-based dual self-organized organism?

According to a fundamental reason all of material entity are appeared as periodical systems.In that way a time is determined. It looks like a motorcyclist that rides under a circus cupola. To keep a moment in that position it must make circles each time returning back symmetrically to a center. This process should be controlled. That rout should be tracked also an energy amount and energy revival should be secured.

The primary description is appeared in inertial memory where formal signs and interconnections are placed. This cycloid is turned into a frequency by means of a trigonometry of the space metric, which combines components together. Generally such metric is the Extra-Finslers (each geometrical point carries a continuity types of geodesics) \[12\]. However each individual metric of certain control actions is consequent and Time-Euclideans one. The Extra-Finslers time separation gives \[12\] the 3D Time-Euclideans image.

A primary each periodical system material condensation is caused with nothing but external features that keeps such periodicity. In primary material appearances has nothing but proto-material as source of that reason. The structure of periodical system is caused and integrated with features of proto-material, which cause such entity as a Quantum. A Quantum is material condensation, which caused of some kind of proto-material protrusion. Such protrusions and absorbing are enough well described in Astrophysics. Actually all of Big Bang, Space Strings and Multi-world hypothesis \[55-57\] are based on that physics appearances. Internal self-organized features of quanta suppose to consider them asSynergistic Quanta.

Proto-material Invisible protrusions become inertial self-organizing structures and its transformation dynamics in form of Synergistic Quanta. Its structure hasuniversal infrastructureof rational matter. The appearances are known in physical entities, numbers and proportions such as Planks constant, Fibonaccis ratio, Avogadros number, Hayflick bio-cells limit etc.

Quantum-Periodic systems intersections give linear interactions and rational numbers (projections) in that. Periodicity and linearity mutual projections gives inertial systems are known in form of Newton physics also in form of Euclidean spaces (up to quantum physics and Riemanns \[58,60 \] then Minkovskys \[60-62\] and Finslers \[63-65\] mathematics) being geometrical at-first (as quantum space generalization) then arithmetical (secondary class-numbers-generalization) one.

The contradiction between quantum condensation and space continuity (e.g. certain structure of easy chemical elements vs not complete and dynamic range in periodical table vs heavy chemical elements shows such the entity) is resolved with categories of structre transformations in form of linear and synergistic quanta interactions, including second fundamental level of signals and data sensors/channels. That material transformations and their appearances also is caused with has nothing but proto-material as source of that reason. The appearances of reasons of the transformations are known as appearances of energy in potentials, dynamics, charges, fields intersections etc.

Hierarchic intersections create two-level constructions with different structure dynamics (fast in the basement). Linear projections of such dynamics formfunctional structuresof organisms. Quantum synergistic integrity of such structure gives physical effects of the whole quantum. Such complex two-level system construction determines memory and information entities. The memory keeps projections and their combinations that forming functional structures and reconstructive logic keys of class-structured knowledge as result of self-learning. Information gives matrix of synergistic system integration as factor, which is preventing a structure entropy. Such structural transformations set the fundamental category of an existing that is known asAutonomous(Autonomic) Control(Management). Its observations, measurements then transformations (trans-structuring, trans-correcting) are converted into time of an existing of that that two-level synergistic quanta-constructions, that is known in entities of living systems (organisms) and their subjective consciousness-informational activity.

Synergistic Quantum Control breaks into two organically tighten components as a functional (Cybernetics) and a synergistic-tunnel control. Its converted into functional control in closed limited mechanical-thermodynamic systems, where a system exhausts out its resources going to a collapse Synergistic-tunnel control determines and contains functional control that is organized in way that allows seeing transformations that lead to a consequence of the other quantum-closed positions(Quantum Tunnels). This is the way of unlimitedmetamorphosis, whichincludesinherited consciousness and basic system form conformation.

The cybernetics control is limited functional control with a fixed functional base. This is the situational control automate with algorithmic or self-learning structuring, which are autonomic just relatively some fixed processing base. It performs stabilizing or purpose-transitional structure deformations. The second sort of control is determining that base and purposes. This is tunnel-synergistic control with internal metamorphosis that is based on key-transitional elements tha are known in phenomena of en entropy preventive information. The information keeps base of a subject existing that is converted into form of signals, data, structures and energy of functional processing. In the common the control is either a quantum structure linear or quantum entropy transformation (deviation, aberration, destruction, distortion), which are determined and gradiently compensated in a quantum and its tunnel extensions or this is the synergistic (the whole systems matrix based) type of a control or this is a combination of them. The human type of control is a combinations with adjustment of the types of domination. The synergistic dominant gives a consciousness-based autonomic control.The Functional dominant gives data-signal type control of a following.

The synergistic type of control is based onthe Information Synthesis Process. This is such knowledge integration that gives the compact matrix of fillings - information about functional-synergistic form of a system. The whole quantum system information control structure sets a technique of such entity as Consciousness.Aconsciousnessis a individual system specific physical matter as a functional-synergistic structure self-realizing. It has clear determined universal infrastructure of its basic technical procedure.

Quantum Control Systems, as being periodical, lead an energy exchange with similar periodical systems in an effect that is known as aResonance\[66,67\]. The Quantum Control System has complex oscillating structure that gives theComplex Systems Resonance. All of the systems structure components set an assembly of resonating sub-systems that are coordinated in time. Such systems always contain recursive-closed linear component also they carry proto-material infrastructure links of non-linear nature. This nature could be controlled by synergistic (informational) resonance effect only.Synergistic or information synthesis based resonanceis physical resonance of the synergistic-complex physical structure that is interacting with its proto-material quantum condensation in way which manifest its structure by criteria of the maximum of pro-to materia energy revival.System inertial functions are converted with Fourier-type compression giving a structure as an instant frequency spectrum.So technically Synergy QuantumControlledsystemis open Self-Organized Auto-Oscillating Systems with proto-material energy revival control.

The nature ofthe Synergistic System Resonancewas not studied enough in the science. Thats why the Synergy Quantum Control technique still not available in medical practice. Thats why a medical branch is concentrated just on functional knowledge and skills developments. Such Quantum Focus lost leads to bulky and just statistically based forms of medical practice whereas e.g. aging, cancer, Alzheimers and similar diseases directly linked with synergistic control breaks.

Meanwhile a fundamental effectiveness of EM and mechanical frequency-profiled (sounds and vibrations) effects are well known and good proved in the wide medical practice. These are well-known light-frequency applications of nano-meter range, including IR and UV, radiation band also EM waves of sub- mm, mm, also sounds (US, SD) and vibration applications. Dr. R. Rife \[68,69\], Dr. H. Clark \[70,71\] and other researchers showed a real frequency based effects in microbiological applications. That are real physical effects. The body cells and microorganisms are really controlled with frequencies and there are many of the contemporary proofs \[72\]. Indeed, the frequencies destroy bacteria and viruses, eliminate harmful mineral and organic deposits, stop pain, stimulates metabolism, cut and splice tissue, gives data about organism condition in probing etc.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

Trading futures, crypto, stocks, index, etc (Since day traders still succeed even with AI traders being heavily used, why would they disappear in the future?)

Selling artisan goods such as handmade wood furniture, paintings, sculptures, watches, wine etc. (People always see handmade objects as a higher quality than mass produced objects)

Sports and E-sports (I assume people like watching other people compete)

Twitch/Youtubeand other entertainment (or whatever the equivalent is in the future)

Professional gamblers and poker players (I doubt robots would be allowed to gamble against people)

Teaching and academia (would becoming a University professor still be seen as a possible career since teaching is that seems like humans would excel at)

Politics and judges (Would we still have a President, Congress, senators, judges, courts, litigation lawyers, etc?

And if they're not, could some AI program be playing OW in secret?

But I've recently recognized that even though the research on the negative effects' of children's screen time is still being debated, we are moving full speed ahead with technologies like VR, 5G, and AI-powered applications. 

Here is what gravely concerns me about these, and why I think it's essential that national governments globally, led by the EU or the US, assign a expert led task forces to pressure relevant law making bodies.

* While engaging with a mobile app, AI infers a childs interests and demographics by analyzing the childs actions and choices, and then it presents the child with highly personalized content and targeted advertising. This AI activity is dangerous for a child because a child does not understand that their experiences are not purely coincidental. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that a child will come to prefer to live in this personalized digital world rather than in the actual world.
* VR headsets are going to amplify the negative effects of this AI-powered personalized world. If mobile screen time is considered dangerous partly because a parent cannot co-view content as easily as they can on a TV, what about VR headsets where the viewing is limited to the user? What is more worrisome is that over time the child may not be able to easily distinguish the content experienced in VR  recorded and streaming video, video games, and video chat  from real life. Therefore, a virtual realistic life that is also personalized will surely be a life that is preferred to real life. To boot, with this technology, developers and content creators will possibly influence a childs thinking in scary ways, directing not only the childs future consumer behaviors but even shaping the childs philosophical, political, and religious thought.
* Then there is what some call the electricity of the new era, 5G, which ties all of the other technologies together. 5G will enable any internet connected device blazing fast speeds with low latency. Verizon claims that 5G will deliver speeds roughly 20 times faster than what is possible with 4G  latency could drop into the single milliseconds, making lag times nearly impossible to detect. So that means that AI-processed data can travel from device to device or device to server and back with nearly zero latency, and images streaming from the other side of the world, even from the outdoors, can appear through VR headsets as if the child is actually present.

Have you thought much about this? How to start a conversation on these new technologies as parents already feel overburdened today with managing screen time?

5G is a new, High speed network with the potential to completely transform the internet

That is 4G - the mobile network that used around the world to make calls, send messages and surf the web. Now there square measure plans for 4G to get replaced by, you guessed it,5G - a new, quicker network that has the potential to rework the net.

5G could be a software system outlined network - it means whereas it wont replace cables entirely it might replace the necessity for them by for the most part operative on the cloud instead. This means can|it'll} have a 100x higher capability than 4G -which will dramatically improve web speeds. For example, to transfer a two-hour film on 3G would take concerning twenty six hours, on 4G youd be waiting vi minutes, and on 5G youll be able to watch your film in precisely over 3 and a 0.5 seconds. But its not simply web capability that may be upgraded. Response times will also be much faster.

The 4G network responds to our commands in precisely underneath fifty milliseconds. With 5G it'll take around one time unit - four hundred times quicker than a blink of the attention. Smartphone users will enjoy a more streamlined experience but for a world that is increasingly depend on the internet just to function, a reduction in time delay is critical.

Self-driving cars, as an example, need faster that info is delivered to autonomous vehicles, the higher and safer, they can run.

For many analysts this can be only one example of however 5G might become the animal tissue for the net of things, AN business thats set to grow threefold by 2025, linking and dominant not simply robots, but also medical devices, industrial equipment and agriculture machinery.5G will also provide a much more personalized web experience using a technique called network slicing. Its the way of making separate wireless networks on the cloud, allowing users to create their own bespoke network.

For instance, an internet gamer wants quicker response times and larger information capability than a user that simply needs to ascertain their social media. Being able to alter the net also will profit businesses. At huge events like Mobile World Congress as an example - there's a mass flow of individuals in one explicit space mistreatment data-heavy applications. But with 5G, organizers might acquire AN augmented slice of the network, boosting its internet capacity and thus improving its visitors online experience.

So when can we start using 5G? Well, not nevertheless and in line with some analysts not till 2020. 5G was created years past and has been talked up ever since. Yet its calculable that even by 2025, the network can still lag behind each 4G and 3G in terms of world mobile connections. Its mainstream existence faces multiple hurdles. The most vital of those after all is price. According to some specialists, 5G could cause network operators to tear up their current business models for it to make business sense. In the U.K. for example, 3G and 4G networks were comparatively low-cost to line up as a result of they were able to roll out on existing frequencies, on the countrys radio spectrum. For 5G to figure properly but, it wants a frequency with a lot of larger information measure which might need latest infrastructure. Some analysts believe that the intensive building and running prices can force operators to share the employment and management of the mobile network. This has been less of AN obstacle for countries like China, who are taking a more coherent approach.

The government, operators and native corporations like Huawei and ZTE square measure near to launch huge 5G trials that might place them at the forefront of apparatus production for the new technology.

That may be at the expense of the West, where there is concern regarding Asias 5G progress. A leaked note from the National council to the White House necessitated a nationalized 5G network to stay the U.S. ahead of their global competitors. White House officers laid-off the concept, however some specialists predict that by 2025 nearly 1/2 all mobile connections within the U.S. will be 5G,a larger proportion than the other country or region. Its still possible but that a lot of of the West can have a a lot of gradual approach to 5G,driven by competition however with a uneven variety of development.

For example, AT&amp;T pledged to start rolling out 5G later this year but in just a handful of cities. For key industrial zones but, its expected the technology are adopted quickly, while for many in rural areas 5G may be a long way off. But once 5G will establish itself and fulfills its supposed potential, it could even change how we get the internet at home and at work -with the wireless network replacing the present system of phone lines and cables. It may not happen long, however 5G is coming.",1,1,False,self,,,,,

The /r/Futurology subreddit frequently features highly upvoted posts on cell-based meat, reflecting the media attention and public interest that has followed the industry. There are many introductory resources to how cell-based meat is produced and what its benefits may be, however there are no comprehensive resources which fully inform those interested in learning more. Below youll find the first post in a 6 part series (to be posted monthly) which walks through the science driving the innovative technology of cell-based meat. **These posts are intended to be educational but lengthy and best understood by those with science backgrounds.**

**Cell-Based Meat Science Discussion Series I: Cell Lines**

[Cell-based meat](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2018/09/10/Cultured-meat-cos-agree-to-replace-term-clean-meat-with-cell-based-meat-and-form-trade-association) is a term for the technology currently being developed which allows for animal stem cells to be grown into consumable meat products without animal slaughter. It is also sometimes referred to as clean meat [as a nod to clean energy and cleaner processing](https://www.gfi.org/clean-meat-consumer-survey-public-is-hungry), which we will discuss later Series V, as well as cultured or lab-grown meat. There are now over 25 companies spread across the globe that are working on making cell-based meat products that are as tasty and affordable as conventional animal meats. However, in order to achieve success, we need a dramatic influx of scientists from a variety of disciplines such as cell and molecular biology, tissue engineering, and chemical engineering to catalyze these industries. In this discussion series, we will review [the core scientific areas involved in cell-based meat production](https://www.gfi.org/images/uploads/2017/06/Mapping-Emerging-Industries.pdf), aiming to provide an in-depth look at how the technology is being developed, the scientific hurdles to overcome to achieve success, and its potential to shape the future of food. 

The series will be broken down as follows: 

* Series I: Cell Lines
* Series II: Bioprocessing
* Series III: Bioengineering
* Series IV: Cell culture media and regulatory considerations
* Series V: Final products
* Series VI: Impact (environment, human health, food security, animal welfare)

**Introduction**

The cell lines used in cell-based meat production ultimately determine many of the downstream variables to consider. As starting material, cells that can self-renew and differentiate into the cell types that make up meat tissue (i.e. myofibers, adipocytes, fibroblasts, chondrocytes, etc) are most attractive. In other words, we need to begin with a [stem cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell). There are several different possibilities for the starting stem cell population, delineated by their [potency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_potency), or ability to differentiate into a diversity of cell types. For instance, embryonic stem cells have the ability to differentiate into cells of all three developmental germ layers (i.e. ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), while adult stem cell populations found throughout our body are more specialized and limited to creating cells of the same germ layer or organ type. The most likely starting cell types for use in cell-based meat production are outlined in Table 1 and discussed below. 

**[Table 1](https://imgur.com/a/pFGtxtP)**

While not discussed throughout, it is also possible to use pluripotent cells or primary cell lines from specific organs or tissues for the generation of other consumable products such as [foie gras derived from hepatocytes](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/eat-it-without-the-guilt-the-story-of-the-worlds-first-clean-foie-gras), or other organ tissues which are more commonly eaten outside of the Western world.

**Pluripotent Stem Cells**

In order to use embryonic stem cells as a source for cell-based meat production, one must first have access to an embryonic stem cell line. Embryonic stem cells are derived from the [inner cell mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_cell_mass) of an early embryonic structure called a blastocyst, which forms just a few days post-fertilization. The first embryonic stem cell lines were derived from mice in 1981 and were followed thereafter by a select few additional species including human, non-human primates, rat, chicken, and fish. However, derivation of stable embryonic stem cell lines is extremely challenging, as the embryonic material is difficult to obtain and work with, the cells are highly sensitive to their growth substrate, and they require different sets of growth factors or inhibitors from species to species to maintain proliferation without spontaneous differentiation. Indeed, the derivation of embryonic stem cell lines from agriculturally-relevant bovine species was only recently achieved in 2018.^[1](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/02/08/1716161115) Therefore, if cell-based meat is to be available for every commonly-eaten animal species, there exists significant work in the establishment of bonafide embryonic stem cell lines from a diverse set of species. 

As an alternative, scientists can utilize a technology called cellular reprogramming to obtain [induced pluripotent stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell) (iPSCs) that maintain the desirable properties of embryonic stem cells without being derived from an embryo. Cellular reprogramming enables the direct conversion of one cell type into any other cell type based on the expression of a defined set of important genes of the final cell type^[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26780608), typically a set of [transcription factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor). Reprogramming is classically performed via viral-mediated overexpression of transcription factors, either via permanent genome integration (e.g. via [Lentivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus)) or stochastic non-integrating expression (e.g. via Sendai Virus^[3](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113052)) based on the virus type. However, reprogramming can also be achieved by additional non-integrating methods such as episomal or mRNA gene delivery^[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329913/), proteins^[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20439621), or small molecules.^[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067267/) The generation of iPSCs can be performed from virtually any adult somatic cell, including easily obtained cells such as white blood cells or skin fibroblasts, by overexpressing the canonical set of transcription factor genes Oct4, Klf4, c-Myc, and Sox2, referred to as Yamanaka factors.^[7](https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2806%2900976-7)  Because these genes are highly conserved, iPSCs have been generated from virtually all agriculturally-relevant species, although examples of fish and other marine animal iPSC derivation are sparse^[8](https://elifesciences.org/articles/00036). Thus, iPSCs are easier to derive than embryonic stem cells while being generally equivalent in their functionality.^[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3388) 

The use of reprogramming technically permits other starting cell types (e.g. fibroblasts) to be directly converted (i.e. [transdifferentiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdifferentiation)) into muscle^[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08232-2), fat^[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450766/), or other cell types, bypassing the iPSC state altogether. Transdifferentiation strategies are somewhat limited in that their conversion efficiencies are variable and incomplete, and they result in a post-mitotic population that undergoes limited expansion.^[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27796171) Given that the production of cell-based meat will require excessively large numbers of cells (discussed in Series II), proliferation would have to occur prior to transdifferentiation and all non-converted cells would be wasted, impacting the overall efficiency of the [bioprocess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioprocess). Nevertheless, these reprogramming technologies may be pursued using non-integrating methods in order to avoid potential regulatory issues (discussed in Series IV) with transgenes. 

**Adult Stem Cells**

Many tissues in the adult body contain a reservoir of stem cells needed to replenish cell populations due to injury, cell death, or normal cellular turnover. These are referred to as adult stem cells. One of the most studied adult stem cell types is the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), sometimes also referred to as mesenchymal stromal cells. MSCs are most commonly obtained from purified cell populations originating from a bone marrow or adipose tissue biopsy, although other sources such as the placenta, dental pulp, or umbilical cord have also been cited. Indeed, the diverse set of tissue sources and resultant cell phenotypes has called into question how MSCs should be defined and whether they are stem cells at all.^[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06756-9) While guidelines from the International Society for Cellular Therapy^[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16923606) have aimed to better define MSCs, some criteria such as cell surface marker expression may not be applicable in species outside of humans and thus will need to be defined. Additionally, MSCs are typically defined in part by their ability to form osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, while MSC potency toward skeletal muscle cells is somewhat limited and can be dependent on tissue source. In general, the multipotent nature of MSCs can be harnessed by culturing cells in specific cell culture medium formulations in order to bias their differentiation pathways (discussed further in Series IV). Thus, MSCs can serve as a readily attainable source of starting cells capable of making the principal cellular components of meat. 

The resident stem cell populations in adult skeletal muscle tissue are referred to as [myosatellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosatellite_cell) or satellite cells. Satellite cells lie alongside myofibers [under the basal lamina of the muscle](http://biomedarticles.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/0/9/27098417/1574818_orig.png) tissue where they remain quiescent until activated upon injury or stress. In mouse, there are roughly 550 satellite cells per 1 mg of muscle tissue^[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22300977), making them one of the most abundant tissue-specific stem cell populations in the body. Satellite cells can be obtained from a small muscle biopsy, under local anesthesia or from animals recently slaughtered, and purified in the lab based on an array of cell surface markers.^[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4793971/) However, maintaining their proliferative capacity in vitro outside of the resident muscle niche has been challenging and is an area of active research. As a tissue-specific stem cell, activated satellite cells readily give rise to myoblasts, which eventually lead to the formation of myocytes, multinucleated myotubes, and myofibers, each delineated by the expression of key transcription factors.^[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634270) There is some evidence that satellite cells can enter an alternative mesenchymal-like pathway, leading to the generation of other cell types such as adipocytes^[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15466890), however this has been refuted.^[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201117/) Therefore, satellite cells offer the most direct method for obtaining skeletal muscle tissue in vitro, but may not be ideal for the creation of other cellular components of meat. 

**Cell Banking**

A reproducible and consistent cell line is essential for any bioprocess. Due to the large number of cell population doublings needed to make cell-based meat at scale, there exists a sizable concern for genetic drift and cell line stability, which may lead to inconsistencies in downstream processing and final product. In essence, as cells continue to divide and replicate their DNA, the probability of an increased burden of genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number variation, large insertions or deletions, epigenetic changes, or aneuploidy) also increases. In some cases, these variations can be harnessed for improved processing (e.g. adaptation to suspension culture or lower concentration of growth factors, discussed in Series II), however, in general, genetic stability is favorable for a reproducible process. 

In order to mitigate the risk of genetic drift, cells will need to be initially expanded, validated via rigorous quality control, and cryopreserved as a master cell bank. Individual vials from the master bank can then be serially subcultured to produce working cell banks. Animal-origin free and chemically-defined cryopreservation techniques will need to be optimized for a diverse set of cell types from various species. This strategy can allow for batch processing of cell-based meat or continuous processing of progenitor stem cells, at least until sufficient differences are detected wherein the culture can then be restarted. Similar strategies are already employed in other biomedicine industries, [such as vaccine production](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/vaccines/ucm202439.pdf), and these may serve as a guide for the cell-based meat industry. 

Currently, there exists few publicly available cell lines of the aforementioned cell types from agriculturally-relevant species for cell-based meat production. Thus, there is a great need for the creation of new cell lines that can be banked and distributed to researchers in academia and industry alike. These biorepositories can be set up similarly to those dedicated to housing tissues and cell lines for efforts related to endangered animal conservation or large scale distribution networks (e.g. [American Type Culture Collection](https://www.atcc.org/)). Having many cell lines available from a diverse array of animal species will be one of the most important factors in bootstrapping the research required for the cell-based meat industry to thrive long-term. The Good Food Institute is funding a project, the [Frozen Farmyard](https://www.gfi.org/researchgrants), to accomplish this goal. 

**Species Differences**

Much of the knowledge for culturing stem cell lines has come from the fields of cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine. While there are many fundamental similarities in laboratory techniques, protocols, and reagents that can be used in cell-based meat production, an important difference lies in growing cells from different animal species. The vast majority of published literature using the cell types previously described comes from studies in human and mouse. While there exist examples of studies using the stem cells described from bovine, porcine, ovine, avian, and piscine animals, the field as a whole lacks well-established protocols and the degree of rich scientific literature from which to draw upon. Despite this, a vast amount of information, some of which is held privately by corporations, does exist on the cellular biology and genetics of livestock species, which may be leveraged for adapting livestock species for cell culture. Additionally, resources such as sophisticated genome annotations, validated antibodies, and other -omics datasets will need to be generated. Lastly, while key developmental processes are generally conserved by evolution, it remains unclear the extent to which species differences will affect the success of applying human- or mouse-based cell culture strategies to evolutionarily distant species such as crustaceans or fish. Thus, the overall bioprocess will likely be replicated from species to species, but key differences, either advantageous or disadvantageous, are to be expected due to inherent biological differences across an evolutionarily diverse set of species.

**Cell Line Considerations**

Other cell line selection strategies may entail generation of multiple cell lines from an individual animal, different biopsy locations within an animal, different individuals within the same species, or clones of each derived cell line. For example, selective breeding has produced desirable traits in specific animal breeds and thus these same traits may be strategically recapitulated in vitro (e.g. using cattle from the [Belgian Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Blue) versus [Holstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein_Friesian_cattle) breed for skeletal muscle production). When possible, cell lines should also be obtained from animals that are raised in closed flocks, herds, or colonies, and free of [known specific pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific-pathogen-free). Having multiple cell lines or clonal lines will also enable companies to choose lines which have the best downstream characteristics (e.g. proliferation rate, differentiation potential, etc), potentially avoiding labor-intensive strategies such as directed evolution to acquire the same characteristics. 

The location of an initial cell biopsy may also have downstream effects. As previously discussed, this could influence the differentiation potential of a mesenchymal stem cell population. For myosatellite cells, a muscle biopsy from a region of fast-twitch muscle fiber will in turn bias production of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which may influence final taste, texture, and metabolic rates of the cells in culture.^[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16436474) Location variables are less likely to influence pluripotent stem cell-derived outcomes, however individual and clonal variation amongst pluripotent stem cell lines is a notoriously difficult problem to manage.^[21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671115003744) With these considerations in mind, its likely that many species, stem cell types, and cell line variables will be explored in order to determine the best cell lines for cell-based meat production. However, one of the inherent advantages of using cell culture to produce meat rather than an animal is the range of real-time testing, data analysis, and parameter iterations which can be made from biopsy to product packaging. These advantages can accelerate the rate of innovation to reach success and create new products (discussed in Series V) versus traditional animal agriculture.

**Cell Proliferation and Immortalization**

In general, the process of cell-based meat production following cell line selection can be broken up into two phases: proliferation and differentiation. In the proliferation phase, stem cells divide repeatedly to generate a large number of cells until they are transferred to a new environment and triggered to differentiate into a mature cell type via changes in scaffolding (discussed in Series III), medium composition (discussed in Series IV), or both. 

One hurdle in obtaining a large number of cells is that the number of times a cell can divide is inherently limited based on the [Hayflick Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit). The Hayflick Limit imposes a limitation on cell divisions due to degradation of end-capping chromosomal telomeres following each cell division. Once a certain number of cell divisions occurs (typically around 30-50 in vitro for human cells), the cells enter a state of [senescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_senescence) and stop dividing. Thus, the number of potential cells acquired from a single starting batch is biologically limited. Some cells, however, can bypass the Hayflick Limit and achieve [cell immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortalised_cell_line). Pluripotent stem cells achieve immortality in part by epigenetic changes^[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665075/) and upregulation of the enzyme telomerase^[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3967062/), which prevents telomere degradation. This property makes pluripotent stem cells especially useful in initial scaling, although genetic drift during proliferation may also lead to cell senescence or apoptosis. 

While some adult stem cells can retain some telomerase expression^[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2360127/), it is insufficient to acquire immortality. One alternative method is to rely on the accumulation of a sufficient number of mutations in vitro to bypass normal cellular checkpoints and achieve spontaneous immortalization. Many cell lines used in research were derived from spontaneously immortalized lines, however the mutational burden can also alter the biology of the cells in unpredictable ways, potentially limiting their utility. Additionally, biological variation between species or cell type can contribute to the probability of spontaneous immortalization or cell transformation. For instance, the naked mole rat, which is highly resistant to cancerous cell transformation, is hypersensitive to contact inhibition^[25](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/46/19352) and resistant to iPSC reprogramming.^[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107597) Other species such as lobsters and fish, which retain high telomerase expression^[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9849895),^[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928394/), or elephants, which have multiple copies of the p53 tumor suppressor^[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5061548/), may thus be easier and harder, respectively, to achieve transformation, although in vivo telomerase expression levels do not necessarily correlate to those observed in vitro.^[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843963) These and other unique animal properties, known or currently unknown, may be strategically harnessed for cell-based meat production. 

A targeted immortalization approach can be achieved by overexpression of exogenously added genes or viral proteins. In these cases, the overexpression of telomerase in combination with inhibition of cell cycle genes such as p16 or Rb^[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12507935) or use of viral elements such as the SV40 Large T Antigen^[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9828095) or adenovirus type 5 E1 gene^[33](https://jvi.asm.org/content/81/1/95) have been utilized for cell immortalization. Precision gene editing (e.g. CRISPR) methods can be used in combination to insert these genes into safe harbor loci^[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22129804), minimizing the risk of alterations in global gene expression. Additionally, tandem use of genetic engineering strategies can create ON-OFF switches for immortalization, through use of Cre-lox or Flp-FRT recombination^[35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25651101),^[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8799138) or piggyBac transposon^[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991573/) systems. Thus, immortalization can be readily targeted or reversed, however, it is currently unclear how spontaneously immortalized or intentionally immortalized lines will be regulated, as significant genetic alterations and use of genetic engineering may warrant rigorous regulatory standards (discussed in Series IV). 

Additional methods to improve proliferation rates or maintain proliferative capacity of non-immortalized stem cells also exist. For example, in myoblasts, use of small molecule compounds can assist in maintaining proliferative capacity via targeting of proliferation pathways^[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742392) or inhibition of specific proteins such as STAT3^[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25194572), p38^[40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28746-7), and Setd7.^[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29395054) Other strategies include mimicking an injured or regenerative state via growth in the presence of cytokines^[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456625/), addition of small peptides normally released following exercise^[43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0131-6), or growth of cells in a hypoxic environment which may more closely mimic fetal oxygen levels.^[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22764051) Similar strategies can tune biochemical pathways in other cell types such as adipocytes or chondrocytes. Many genetic engineering methods can also be employed to achieve similar results. These include gene overexpression via inducible or constitutively active systems and gene inhibition or knockout. In general, mimicking the native stem cell niche to retain stemness in vitro is an area of active research, and there exists a broad amount of possibilities (more in Series III) for implementing these strategies for cell-based meat production.

Day in day out society complains about racism, sexism, transphobia and other -isms related to how people look. I honestly can't believe how they receive so much attention yet the most pervasive, insidious *debilitating* \-ism is swept aside and relegated to ""lol only angry virgins care about that"" status. Lookism. Lookism is the core -ism that underpins and compliments all other -isms. I could quote numerous scientific studies regarding the halo effect, the effect looks have on jobs, love interests, pay-grade, friendship forming, confidence - every fucking aspect of ones life for all the good it would do. Racism and sexism and all these other -isms are archaic learned behaviours that will disappear naturally over time, lookism on the other hand is intrinsic form of discrimination, it is biological and and inherent of being a human being. A good looking white person a good looking black person a good looking asian person a good looking \[insert ethnicity here\] all share the same fucking traits that make them look good and humanities ability to alter these traits are so fucking stone-age tier that I cry myself to sleep every night about it. No amount of osteotomies or craniofacial/maxillofacial surgeries can take a biologically repulsive human and make them biologically attractive because it's impossible to alter the way a skull/face/soft tissues/eyeballs/muscles/maxillofacial processes/zygomatic processes have grown, to the required extent needed to make an ugly person attractive after the fact. The technology, the in-vivo gene editing, the whatever it is that's needed for this shit just doesn't exist. I want to kill myself every fucking day because of my clinically deformed face. Lookism is the only thing that matters yet people would rather act as if the colour of someones skin is a more important factor in everything that life entails.

Don't respond to this if you're going to say some bullshit LoOkS aRe SubJecTivE spiel, because I dare you to try and live for one day in the life of me or the countless millions of other people with inoperable untreatable craniofacial deformities. I am angry, I am bitter, I am a literal biological reject - I don't say this for pity, I don't want pity, I say this because being able to admit the truth no matter how much society wants to avoid it is oddly cathartic.

With the growth of devices especially mobile phones, the Internet changed to a 2 class society: Those who have public IP addresses, and those who don't. People like you and me are have become disadvantaged.

&amp;#x200B;

IPv6 is about to change this dramatically: With IPv6 everyone **can** have an public IP address. Actually, no. Everyone can have **ALMOST INFINITELY MANY IPv6 addresses**.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays if you are a startup, a private person, you have to pay to publish your services, to enable you. With IPv6 you have the choice to publish your service even own your notebook. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the cloud services existing today might still survive, however they are practically seen not required anymore. You want to talk to your friend? Just connect directly to his phone! You are running a small shop and want to use your cashing machine as a webshop? All clear!

&amp;#x200B;

Everything that nowadays is dependent on an intermediary will be possible directly. You have IoT devices that are needed for protecting your elderly and you want to check whether they are still reachable? Just ping' them!

Hopefully, I am not violating any rules. I do not believe I am, but I am trying to find information from people who might be more knowledgeable and scientifically literate on the subject than I am.  


I have congenital heart failure. Unfortunately, I nearly died a couple of months ago and my condition has progressed and my doctor believes I will need a transplant within 3 to 5 years. I admit it, I'm afraid. Even if one survives the operation, the danger of rejection is ever present, and anti-rejection meds are another nightmare all together.  


So, with that being said I have a few questions:  


1. Are there any promising developments for cloned organs, 3D printed organs, or re-cellurized organs in the near future I can be on the lookout for, and be hopeful for?  

2. Is there any research being done or showing promise that might trick the body into accepting a transplanted organ as its own and thereby remove the necessity of anti-rejection meds for the duration of the patients life?

3.  Any other developments that might be useful for people like me?

&amp;#x200B;

I have dreamed of freedom all my life. I have lost so much to this disease, and I am just looking for hope.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

This form of air travel, whilst significantly slower than conventional fixed wing aircraft (an average speed of about 100km/h or somewhere thereabouts). Will have the potential to be far more luxurious with features akin to a flying ocean liner (sleeping berths, a restaurant, a bar, an observation deck, and many other creature comforts.)

This all makes the automation apocalypse seem inevitable. There are two issues I see with this. One is that 5G, as I understand it will not be a global platform, it will launch city to city and most for the most part will be for super localized applications. This makes me think the automation apocalypse will take more technological advances in order to come true. This brings me to my second point, Moore's law died in 2018.

Hello all,

My focus since 1992 has been customizing education (e.g., for AI). Links to praise I received in 1998 and 2004:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-02-13/one-more-thing-on-43-things) ([cached](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AAzl9aFN9dWMJ%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2005-02-13%2Fone-more-thing-on-43-things+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;fbclid=IwAR1i0rYcEj2PKJCWhDFX8LVwrOQF4tSpHs2Q4PerPDAcmM890ip52mHOC6c) by Google)

Details about said threat:[http://libgen.io/book/index.php?md5=0d82c62ac8195c55fcd49cbb5394a877](http://libgen.io/book/index.php?md5=0d82c62ac8195c55fcd49cbb5394a877)

Excerpt:

**\~77 million psychopaths (Ps) are IMPERILED. Worst case: A growing number of Ps are resisting (e.g., coercing, equipping to terrorize). . . .**

**Re: Ps are IMPERILED (reason 1 of 2)**

\-- Summary (details below) --

Psychopathy is substantially heritable.

Via the burgeoning science of molecular genetics, many/most/all genetic markers for psychopathy will be identified soon.

Indefinite detention of Ps could/should ensue, according to a leading psychopathy researcher who's tenured at the University of Pennsylvania.

**Re: 1) my submissions of my threat analysis to U.S. government agencies, 2) motivation for you to contact particular journalists**

Details below.

. . .**Re: \[said UPenn researcher writing in** **his 2013 book** **that Ps are\] ""time bombs \[waiting to explode\] . . .""**

From 2011 book *The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry*:

&gt;\[\]She said, Ive got a *bad* personality. I like to hurt people. I thought she was winding me up. I said, Okay, fine. So we went through the \[fMRI\] tests \[i.e., brain scans\]. When she was looking at the photographs of the mutilated bodies, the sensors showed that she was getting a kick off of them. Her sexual reward centerits a sexual thingwas fired up by blood and death. Its subconscious. It happens in milliseconds. She found those things *pleasant*.

. . .**Re: Ps are IMPERILED (reason 2 of 2) (part 1 of 2)**

\-- Summary (some details follow; more via part 2) --

In the years ahead:

* the cost of conceiving a child via buying a top-quality gamete will decrease steadily/rapidly (e.g., soon all women with health insurance will be able to afford in vitro fertilization and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis)
* superstar-biased technological change (SBTC) will continue to be rapid and to accelerate rapidly
* buying a top-quality gamete will be the best way for most individuals to conceive a child who can thrive amid SBTC

As demand for top-quality gametes increases, demand for indicators of gamete quality will increase. In particular, demand for better indicators of learning ability.

TOP indicators of learning ability will take shape via the ongoing build-out of human-capital markets (e.g., customized education).

Via the above in this section, therell be UPSIDE for all non-psychopaths (NPs): for some, $ via selling ones gametes; for all, access to top-quality gametes; etc. (All NPs = \~99% of people.)

Implications of this upside: Many/most people will soon be active in human-capital markets; many/most of these people will be active on a (near-)daily basis.

Via this activity:

&gt;Each P will be unable to reproduce via gaining access to (top-)quality gametes, unless s/he coerces.  
Each P with superstar-level ability will suffer very costly career damage/loss, unless s/he coerces.

. . . **Re: its almost certain that many Ps knew before this write-up that Ps are IMPERILED (part 1 of 2)**

From the November 2012 article in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin titled The Corporate Psychopath:

&gt;Todays corporate psychopath may be highly educatedseveral with Ph.D., M.D., and J.D. degrees have been studied . . .

From *The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry*:

&gt;It wasnt only Bob \[Hare\] who believed that a disproportionate number of psychopaths can be found in high places. In the days after Essi Viding had first mentioned the theory to me, I spoke to scores of psychologists who all said exactly the same.

. . . **Motivation for you to contact particular journalists re: the threat that Ps pose to NPs (e.g., to your children and grandchildren)**

Ps being neutralized would make many journos MUCH safer (e.g., [journos who report(ed) on The Panama Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/), which show how easy it is to finance terror using U.S. shell companies \[1\]; journos who might get Khashoggi-ed for other reasons). So journos would be likely to make said threat known to President Trump, and to the Democrats in the U.S. who are 2020 presidential candidates.",0,1,False,self,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

What will we call A.I., computers, and robots in the future? And what of clones? Will computers and robots still exist; intended to do the work for the new inhabitants of earth? Those we define as sentient.

&amp;#x200B;

A.I. is, in general terms, a computer that is capable of formulating complex thoughts and creative expressions on par with humans.Computers are a silicon-based processing unit created for the purpose of doing complex mathematics calculations and have, up until this point, been developed to make tasks in humans lives easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Robot denotes a mechanical system comprised of metals and plastics and run by silicon based processors. The origin of the term robot comes from Rossumovi Univerzln Roboti, a Czech play about synthetically grown sentient life forms that were required to work for humans. These synths are most similar to the androids from the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

&amp;#x200B;

Synths are, as I define it, those created via synthetic means mimicking natural birth, and who (as of now) are intended to resemble humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Robot, Computer, and A.I. are terms we use to denote something that does work for humans. We define them based on [us.So](https://us.So) what will they call themselves in the future? We call ourselves human and define our self-aware existence as alive. Humans are, at the time of writing this, carbon based systems full of water and run by a brain that came into being via birth. But will that definition change as well?

&amp;#x200B;

Taken to its logical extreme it would appear that in the future there would be 3 types of living being. Birthers those created by way of biological breeding. Synths those created synthetically but in a way that mimics Birthers. And Robots those of metal, plastic, and silicon that have become self-aware.

&amp;#x200B;

And even these definitions will sound ignorant in the future. What of cyborgs? Those that are a combination of Human and A.I. What if you created a Synth body but it was operated by a silicon based processor? Will there be natural birth in the future, since birth is dangerous to the body and cloning can solve that problem? And what of generic modification prior to birth? Will we call them fake?

&amp;#x200B;

Every human in history has, to some degree, drawn lines of separation between themselves and others. We draw lines on maps separating countries and ""races"" that are our own abstract constructs. Will we find a way of drawing lines between those that came into being via a different process than ourselves? Using terms like clone and robot to demean, harm, and hand wave away the fact that they are just as capable of abstract thought, are self-aware, and for all intents and purposes are alive. There are any number of words we use today to do the same thing to each other, and we are the same species.

&amp;#x200B;

One day future generations are going to have to ask these questions and they will not be easily answered. And provided beings unlike ourselves are capable of the aforementioned, they will choose their own name as we have chosen ours.

&amp;#x200B;

Though the most interesting, albeit meta, thought to me is: provided that Humans, Synths, and Robots will one day be on par with one another; even this thesis, which attempts to pose a parity between them, may one day in the future, be incredibly beingist.",5,1,False,self,,,,,

Cars develop problems, weird problems and they are suspected to a lot of abuse. Old or ever current cars are simple in their construction. They can survive harsh conditions and unintentional rash driving. these AV are not that strong in their construction. Too many parts to failure and too much complicated construction.

These cars will be like smartphones. Top end will be like Apple, no shit premium product but a budget car bought by an average person will be like xiaomi, Asus etc. Remember how the first iPhone was simply godsend, too many features, no lags no fuss but look now what budget 2019 smartphones are suspected to. Lags, forced updates, bugs etc.

With time as these vehicles will replaced ic manual vehicles there will be cost cutting, poor workmanship, higher defects, reduction in overall quality and software issues. One broken wire and you're fucked.

Also don't tell me that there will be operator in each car or you'll be partially driving your car. No, that's just for now. Do you know what is same as an av. A bus. Have you ever worried about how your bus driver or train driver is driving. You just sit on your seat and indulge in your activities. Same will happen with AV.

The best thing that could happen is that don't take full control off a driver's hands. Just aid the driver with ai to increase his efficiency and Sense but Don completely replace the driver.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working for some months during my spare time on a project that aims to grow funds for anti-aging research institutions. I am building a trustless platform where contributions get rewarded with ethereum tokens that in the event of a  patent or treatment being discovered could be used as currency for production rights over patents or to pay for treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe it benefits everyone involved and that with proper exposure it can get many funds from the crypto world to anti-aging research.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still tweaking the decentralised platform that manages the funds and based on feedback I might add or remove features.

We are already well underway with bionic eyes and arms and such that can be controlled by our brains. So that doesen't seem like one of the main obstacles.  
  
However the brain requires oxygen and nutrients. Synthetic blood would solve oxygen, and nutrients as well. However as a friend of mine stated, our gut bacteria also serves a vital role. So the question is: Could synthetic blood also cover what the gut bacteri provides? What about hormones?   
  
The question is basically: **What are the most problematic parts of transplanting a brain out of the body?** This on a technological and biological level. I'm guessing just having the tech to do the surgery itself without us dying would be just as much of a problem.

In the end of the novel all of the children in the world suddenly lost their individuality and merged with an a alien being that absorbs other consciousness into itself called the Overmind. The children ended up destroying the planet in the process, killing the humans who were still individuals while the children became one with the Overmind. This was supposedly treated as a good thing and the next great evolution of man, to abandon individuality and for a single godlike consciousness.

At first I was disturbed by the ending due to the loss of our individuality and being absorbed into a single gestalt like consciousness. But another part of me started thinking that maybe this should be what humanity strives for. As being a single consciousness will eliminate all pain and suffering that comes with individuality like crime, war etc. And it would basically turn us into a god.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional details provided (originally posted by user Matthew Lane on 2/17/19) :

 

In  short, what I ask is whether or not an AI could use a recently deceased  body, to piece by piece copy it, rather than trying to bioprint body  parts from scratch. If nothing else, for the sake of learning how parts  and whole are made. On the topic of coping a brain, there is significant  possibility already: RNA Barcoding (1) can permit in-depth mapping of  neural connections, meaning that if the brain was dissected, after being  barcoded, then it could be reconstructed in perfect detail; yet, only  in a digital format.

What I ask then,  is whether an AI could learn to copy the structure it sees into a  physical medium, recreating neural connections not by directly printing  them, due to the scale and complexity, but by instead using the  Replicator (2) which employs light to create full models in a single  step. If the brain cells were engineered to be photosensitive, then in  reconstruction, the Replicators stimulation could change what is  essentially a blank lump into the same detailed patterns which held a  lifetimes memories.

The purpose of  all this, from a transhumanist perspective, is consciousness transfer,  but only if the process does not end here. Another step is needed, for  even if brain and body are copied perfectly, there is still the problem  of continuity: the self is lost no matter how perfectly its neural cage  is reconstructed, if that lustrous, flitting thing is itself, left  behind.

But what this does accomplish,  is a vast stride in the right direction. For, if done as well as I  believe possible, then there is a perfect avatar, a copy of your present  body wrought of younger cells. Doing this does however require the  total destruction of your current body, but that does not of itself mean  your death is inexorable.

What is  needed now, is a place for your consciousness to be held in stasis while  its home is rebuilt: something that need be no more than an additional  lobe, rather than a full brain. The Law of Specific Energies of Nerves  (3) tells us that regardless of stimulation type, certain nerves produce  certain sensations, and only these. Thus it is, that if a smaller brain  region was printed, it could be incorporated into the bodys network  without necessarily binding it directly to the original brain, something  that may help with popularity and comfort, since few among us relish  the idea of having our skull cracked open.

All  this region need be capable of doing, is sending thought, and receiving  it. Integrated with existing nerves, it may intercept signalling, may  prevent the use of a body part, but it is not meant to last. Instead,  all this is meant to do is provide the consciousness with somewhere to  stay while the body is being rebuilt.

Consciousness  is the amalgam of connectome and pattern, and is preserved only through  direct continuity. I offer the following proof:

* If a patient  suffers severe brain damage, continuity is not lost; even an entire  lobes darkness, while catastrophic for function and quality of life,  does not make of the individual a fundamentally different person
* Circuitry was lost, but not continuity
* So long as part of the brain exists, so to does consciousness; so long as continuity is unbroken.
* This  means, that if another, smaller brain was integrated into the network,  it would provide a sanctuary if the original was destroyed, as it would  be in order for copying to take place.
* Continuity is preserved, but not circuitry.
* Once the brain is reconstructed, once its first cells are made, and no later, the artificial region is to it connected.
* Continuity is preserved, and circuitry is reestablished.
* Once  this is done, the smaller brain can be disconnected; integrated or not,  the memories it stores are only those directly before Transference, and  losing these is not catastrophic by any reckoning.

Thus  it is that in my opinion, a new body can be made, and the consciousness  poured into it, so long as continuity is established, maintained, and  never, for any moment ruptured. So long as the new brain is integrated,  so long as the originals last flickers are linked with its own,  unfading light, then in reunion, the consciousness and self will have  been preserved.

Hi!

We are the Science Bros.

   
 

We created a new Blog at [sciencebros.ca](https://sciencebros.ca/)

Go check it out if you like tech, robotics, bionics, new inventions, movie review, game review and more...

   
 

We also have a YouTube Channel where we will post our new web show called Science Bros. | Saviors of Humanity. 

It's a comedy show where we do stupid robots and inventions to save the future. Come check it out! the first episode will be out soon and if you like the idea, don't forget to subs and share. It would help us a lot! :) 

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE7hRbyYEBpjDi0voWkcFRQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE7hRbyYEBpjDi0voWkcFRQ)

   
 

We make a podcast too in French tho. But we will make one in English if people are interested. Meanwhile, every subject that we talk in the podcast become an article on the Blog so you can check it out!

   
 

Our main goal has a group is to make new Bionics applications like prosthetic limbs our human augmentations. We will post updates on that too everywhere we can! Right now, we are working on a robotic hand.

   
 

So, if you like the ideas, you have suggestions or questions, we would be happy to talk to you!

   
 

Talk to you later!

Many smaller countries, additionally, would be associated with one of these countries. Such a space race would commence with a few countries constructing space elevators, drastically reducing the cost of space travel. Such an endeavor would allow for autonomous vehicles to mine on other planets, and later on, perhaps, people would begin to permanently begin to live on such worlds. Terraforming would come into play, and soon, 2-3 interstellar civilizations would exist with huge amounts of tension. This could lead to an immense war, ultimately spelling doom to much humanity, with the exception of a few isolated colonies sent back to a tribal era because of the war. 

Now, what I need help with is constructing a feasible future scenario with those criteria- one packed with a rich history of decisions by various leaders, a complex dynamic of alliances between nations, and the various objectives behind it all that I would not be able to construct myself.

**The Information is Very interesting in this blog may this talk about 2018 But I want to know what other companies will do or doing in 2019**

I am giving little or you may say short description about this blog

According to this blog

*""Google and OnePlus were the main brands which sent all their cell phones with the most recent rendition of Android OS in 2018, another report said on Monday. As per statistical surveying techARC, 32 models of cell phones were propelled by different unique hardware producers a year ago.*

*By and large, Vivo drove the number of dispatches with 7 models having the most recent Android OS variant transported out of the processing plant. The second spot was taken by Nokia which propelled four models, trailed by Tecno (3), the report said. OnePlus Trolls Apple iPhone After Becoming Leading Indian Smartphone Brand in 2018.*

*With stock Android turning into the inclination of clients, the OEMs can diminish the update turnaround time for OS as it requires negligible incorporation from their end after Google discharges one, said Faisal Kawoosa, Founder and Chief Analyst, techARC.*

*Almost 80 percent of the dispatches with most recent OS variant had Android 8.1 (Oreo) pre-stacked when sent available to be purchased. The rest of the 20 percent had Android 9.0 (Pie) rendition. Fortunately notwithstanding for the section level (sub-Rs 5,000), clients could get a cell phone with the most recent Android variant, which was sold by Nokia and Lava, the discoveries appeared.""*

The deeper problem might lie with the fact that people see labor and work as something that gives their life meaning, when in reality, meaning is intrinsic to itself and can be derived through more ""meaningful"" work. Work that enables you to manage your schedule to the point where you can take part in family, friends and love. Work that enables you to dedicate more of your life to learning several skills, listening to music, reading libraries worth of books, exploring hitherto unexplored aspects of knowledge, philosophy and more.
Its a touchy subject and often is interpreted as communism. But I guess that is the nature of being human. To have so many interpretations of a concept that you can never double down and make a decision unless you absolutely have to.

With automation, unless we remove the need for income completely, a UBI may not be a choice but a necessity. And implementing it might just allow for a lot of the existential difficulties people have just surviving to dissipate. Because every human has a value intrinsic to themselves and they have the right to exist at a respectable level.
 
Once again, all my opinion but I tend to be optimistic even though life tends to be very harsh. Automation and UBI, though scary can lead to a much more self sufficient and enriching life if executed properly and lead by proper management and careful consideration.

The negotiating process for outside deals tends to be narrow and confidential, and this seems like a waste of opportunity.

Let's say instead that research firms put together a common marketplace for scientific investigation, and they declare what data they intend to find before doing it.  Institutions and businesses seeking data of that sort could offer bids for exclusive (but time-limited) access in open competition, with the net effect of rapidly and efficiently pooling resources to fund science. 

With this approach, what they're offering may not be *exactly* what the customer is looking for, but could be applicable enough that it's worth paying for.  Moreover, economies of scale could apply to actually make it cheaper (sometimes) than hammering out the details of bespoke investigations or redirecting internal resources that may not be the most efficient at finding a given type of result.

The kind of problems we are going to see this approach tackle will be problems that are somewhat noise and error resistant and that do not demand abstract reasoning. A special focus will be behavior that is easier to learn than to articulate - most of us know how to walk but we couldn't possibly tell anyone how we do it. Similarly with grasping objects and other such skills. These things involve building neural networks, filling in state-spaces and so on, and cannot be captured as a set of rules that we speak in language. You must experience the dynamics of your own body in infancy and thrash about until the changing internal numbers and weights start to converge on the correct behavior. Different bodies mean different dynamics. And robots that can learn to walk can learn other sensorimotor skills that we can neither articulate nor perform ourselves.

What are examples of these type of problems? Well, for example, there are already autonomous lawnmowers that will wander around gardens all afternoon. The next step might be autonomous vacuum cleaners inside the house (though clutter and stairs present immediate problems for wheeled robots). These are all sorts of other uses for artificial animals in areas where people find jobs dangerous or tedious - land-mine clearance, toxic waste clearance, farming, mining, demolition, finding objects and robotic exploration, for example. Any jobs done currently or traditionally by animals would be a focus. We are familiar already from the Mars Pathfinder and other examples that we can send autonomous robots not only to inhospitable places, but also send them there on cheap one-way \`suicide' missions. (Of course, no machine ever \`dies', since we can restore its mind in a new body on earth after the mission.)

myself i'm very concerned with climate change and there are some victories, but the one being massively hailed by this sub is far from being as big as it is claimed. 

So to begin with, this article : https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/02/21/kicking-ass-her-generation-applause-16-year-old-greta-thunberg-eu-chief-pledges-1

Is based upon that Reuters report : https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-teen-activist-idUSKCN1QA1RF

Which says the following:
&gt; In the next financial period from 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards action to mitigate climate change, Juncker said of his proposal for the EU budget, which is typically 1 percent of the blocs economic output, or 1 trillion euros ($1.13 trillion) over seven years.


The 1 trillion is the TOTAL European budget over the 7 years. 

Only one fourth of that is being invested into fighting the climate change. So that's only 250 billions and not 1 trillion. 

It's a massive confusion between the total budget of the EU and the budget allocated to fight the climate change.

A Sustainable Energy Generation System (SEGS) is an electric power system supported by 100% renewable energy. The root challenge of designing SEGSs is figuring out how much renewable energy and how much storage is required for sustainability. A SEGS is sustainable if it can meet the goal of supplying enough energy year-round. 

SEGS can be designed using intermittent or non-intermittent renewable energy resources, or both. Non-intermittent renewable energy resources are technologies that produce a steady and continuous power supply. Geothermal, nuclear, biomass and hydroelectric are a few examples of non-intermittent renewable energy resources. For these technologies, there exists a trivial solution for designing SEGSs.

**The trivial solution for non-intermittent sources is the net nameplate generation capacity must be greater than or equal to the projected peak power demand.** Consider California as an example. This figure shows the [actual power demand of California](https://i.imgur.com/JFauEa6) for the last 3 years (2016-2018). Notice how each year had a power peak. 2016 had a power peak of 58GW. 2017 had a power peak of 63 GW. 2018 had a power peak of 59GW. Based on this data, [the trivial solution for California is a net nameplate generation capacity of 63GW](https://i.imgur.com/KS013tx) or greater.

As stated, the main goal of a power system is supplying enough power to meet the demand all year round. The trivial solution solves this problem by incorporating a net non-intermittent generation nameplate capacity that exceeds all possible power demand quantities. Since the trivial solution can always meet the power demand, the trivial solution doesnt require energy storage. 

With this solution, the power supply is greater than the power demand for most of the year. The extra power will need to be detached or redirected to balance the electric grid. The extra energy can be detached by turning off power plants, or the extra energy can be redirected by powering stand-by devices such as carbon scrubbers. This graph shows [how much extra energy will be available](https://i.imgur.com/DRfgre4) assuming the resources are operating year-round. The green area represents the extra energy. For this example, a 63GW SEGS will produce 270,000GWh of extra energy each year.

To conclude, the purpose of this post is to share a solution for designing SEGS that is, in my opinion, the easiest to understand. The best solution for designing SEGS will involve a combination of intermittent and non-intermittent renewable energy resources.

## What Front Pages Tell Me



In this week, the front pages told to me:

Nike owes Zion a sponsorship because he slipped. This is supposed to be important news, I guess.

Vaccines are 100% safe and effective. Risk free. Any minor complaint, or a suggestion to improve them backed by research and repeated experiments will be dealt with pretentious hate and ridicule. This will include personal attacks with links of info that will only broaden the topic, and you can expect nothing to further the discussion. They are perfect.

Takei shared a link to show Trump is supposed to lack credibility, and the NYT is the best, ever. Im supposed to agree and hate him just because others do, too.

Articles are still up about Amazon leaving New York so I can continue to hate the rich. Despite that Amazon moving in wouldve been close to an infinite cash on cash ROI if they moved to NY.

0% credit card offerings so I can have free money, but still hate the rich.

The world is so worry free that the only news to report on are these tabloids and a debate between edge brownies, and center brownies (I took a bite into this one).

DOW Jones to $26,000. Buy, buy, buy! Once your money is in, its bye, bye, bye. Go listen to some Nsync. Dont worry about the 10-year bull market.

With the propaganda machines continuing to roll, its always good to seek out and choose who you listen to. The Facebook feed, and front pages just wont do.

1. vehicles crashing into each other.
2. vehicles hitting people.

Self driving cars could solve at least the first of these issues very well. 

1. There would be no need for traffic lights if vehicles knew where each other were, and each just adjusted speed to avoid hitting the intersection of their paths at the same time. Humans do this already when merging, but if you're ever experienced a bunch of humans merging - they *really* suck at it. 
2. Pedestrian crossing lights would still be necessary, unless we created small raised bridges to cross roads, or raised all sidewalks. Or, we guided people's crossing using some other form of tech. 

Next traffic flow, which I see being caused by 3 major factors.

1. Improper spacing - People driving too close to each other, and the causing a chain of breaking which eventually causes some drivers to stop when they otherwise could have kept going. 
2. Improper Lane Changing - this is basically merging, but when there are multiple streams of traffic and someone changes lane too close to another person it again causes a string of break checks that end in stopped traffic. 
3. Drivers not being able to anticipate the actions of other drivers. 

Dr [**Eddie Wilson**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/7881410/Mathematical-formula-predicts-phantom-traffic-jams.html), an expert on traffic modelling at Bristol University, said: ""The exact point at which a traffic jam starts is very difficult to measure as it often causes a wave that produces a jam 20 miles further back ... My own feeling is that it has more to do with lane changes, particularly at junctions when there are large numbers of vehicles changing lanes.""

\-----

These are exemplified in this 2008 Japanese Study - [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/3/033001/meta](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/3/033001/meta) (interesting pictures about halfway down.)

They set up a scenario where drivers had to continuously drive around a circular track, and everyone had enough space as long as they were able to maintain speed and distance. And humans couldn't do it. It took one person driving too close to another and having to break, or driving too slow and forcing the human behind to break, and traffic was created. The cars bunched at one end, and the cars at the other end caught up, creating a situation where there were always cars having to stop. What's extra funny is this experiment was done another way previously, on a long oval track. They saw that people needed to break to go around the turns at the ends, and thus traffic formed at either end. So this study is easier, with no breaking necessary to go around tighter turns, it's a big circle, and humans still couldn't get it done! 

\-----

So we see all of these issues stem from 2 main issues with human drivers. 

1. Their lack of understanding of the traffic system as a whole - which makes sense because they can't know what other cars are doing or going. 
2. Their inability to maintain proper spacing - something self driving cars could excel at.

Self-driving cars in communication with each other could solve both of these issues.

In summary, I see a lot of merit in having an overarching network that all vehicles are part of. A network which would inform all vehicles on the road where other vehicles are, where they are going, and at what speed etc. They could then use this information to adjust course and speed, allowing them to then weave through intersections without traffic lights, and essentially move as one complex unit - having all the cars in a stream start and stop at once, and adjusting their speed to allow streams to mingle. Lights would still be useful for crosswalks and pedestrian safety; but if we were really trying to *maximize* traffic flow then we could have raised side walks or crosswalks that allowed pedestrians to cross above or below traffic without interrupting flow. This would only work if all the cars on the road were self driving, but if they were then it could work really well - even looking like what's portrayed in this very popular gif: [https://i.imgur.com/OH4iBGO.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/OH4iBGO.gifv)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - traffic would look like this if cars co-ordinated: [https://i.imgur.com/OH4iBGO.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/OH4iBGO.gifv) and if they co-ordinated they wouldn't need traffic lights to stop themselves crashing into each other. 

P.s. to the moderators - I know gifs are against the rules, but this one illustrates what co-ordinated traffic looks like so well that I hope you can forgive it!",24,8,False,self,,,,,

I prophesy that within the next five years that the AI will be able to pictorially reproduce anything with perfect photographically realistic precision.

I can't wait to see an AI make a video/motion picture presentation out of thin air using this same kind of CNN/GAN computing architecture. The AI music is probably going to start sounding better too, time going forward. 

But like I say, the minute that I see an AI generated cartoon or meme or humor text that makes me laugh out loud--know that our days are numbered because then the AI will have the correct ""comprehension"" algorithm of what makes us tick.

What really shocked me though is this appearance of humanlike cognition in demonstrations lately. I know that the computing that brings about these outputs is nothing like the human brain at all, but nevertheless have you actually seen the debating AI? It is one thing to hear about it and an altogether different thing to see it happen before your eyes. 

Don't be taken by surprise. That debating AI is the cognitive equivalent of that Atlas backflipping and parkouring.

Watch: watch...

One of these startups, actually had the idea to manage the artworks sold to the crowd and place the assets in Museums in order to exhibit the art in public spaces rather than keeping it in dark storages.

Weve been building the first step, the assistant is like a chatbot who can tell your story to your audience. Your audience can ask questions about you, get to know your experience, etc. 

Later it would be able to auto schedule appointments or calls (have a calendar function), so when your audience want to talk to you, they can schedule a time slot directly through that AI assistant. 

Just like some companies have a chatbot siting at the corner of their website and takes care of FAQ, why dont we have one for ourselves?

Okay, let's say, fast forward 1000+ years, we have discovered every piece of brain circuit and know how every phenomenon in the mind gets generated e.g. How and why someone feels love towards other, how someone gets a sense of beauty, how we get a sense of smell, taste.

What significance will it have for common folks?

\- ????

What significance will it have for passionate people?

* They will be able to replicate emotions, perceptions like smell, touch, etc. And abstract perceptions like love, hatred, etc.
* They will be able to convert the brains understanding into products and services.
* They will be able to sell these products and services to others
* They will make common people think that they are missing something
* Some of them will realize that they themselves can use these services and products for their own minds.

And again for common folks, they will just become consumers of these products and services.
