In an effort to promote healthy discussion in submissions, /r/futurology is looking for more comment moderators to add to our team.


**What is comment moderation?**

Comment moderators are responsible for going into submissions and removing posts that break the subreddit rules. They are also responsible for reviewing posts that have been reported by users or automoderator.

**Why be a comment moderator?**

Comment moderation is a great way to give back to a subreddit you enjoy, learn how to mod a larger subreddit, and to show that you are dedicated when applying to become a full moderator.

**What are the requirements?**

* your account must be at least 6 months old
* you must have at least 1000 comment karma
* your posting history should not look like the posts we are trying to remove

Comment moderation requires a minimum of about 20-30 minutes a day, so make sure you would want to do this over an extended period of time.

**How do I apply?**

Please fill out this [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1m_6nQbq5sjF6ejqQqSoV8Wy1hERId_rjHXsWBM5JipI/viewform?usp=send_form).

Are it really accelerating or are we reaching a plateau?
In know a lot of words have already been spent on this topic, but there is one think that bother me and I would like the opinion of this community.

The problem I'm thinking about is the lack in the past decades of new major scientific theories. I'm non speaking about new experimental discoveries, new technologies or new proofs of previous theories. Looking at this page on wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries) and selecting only new theories or new physical laws I get this list:

* 1543 - heliocentric model
* 1608 - laws of planetary motion
* 1662 - law of ideal gas
* 1687 - Laws of motion, law of universal gravitation
* 1763 - Bayesian probability
* 1787 - law of ideal gas
* 1789 - law of conservation of mass
* 1802 - teleological evolution
* 1805 - Atomic Theory
* 1827 - Ohm's law
* 1827 - Avogadro's law
* 1843 - First law of thermodynamics
* 1859 - Theory of evolution
* 1861 - Germ theory
* 1865 - laws of inheritance
* 1865 - Definition of Entropy
* 1869 - Periodic table
* 1873 - Theory of electromagnetism
* 1900 - law of black body radiation
* 1905 - special relativity
* 1906 - Third law of thermodynamics
* 1913 - Model of the atom
* 1915 - general relativity 
* 1924 - Pauli exclusion principle
* 1925 - Schrdinger equation
* 1927 - Uncertainty principle
* 1927 - Theory of the Big Bang
* 1928 - Dirac equation 
* 1929 - Hubble's law 
* 1948 - Information theory.
* 1948 - Quantum electrodynamics
* 1963 - Plate tectonics
* 1964 - standard model

The trend is accelerating until 1948, then the only major theory is the standard model in 1964. My fear is that without new scientific theories even technological progress will slow down and eventually stop. The list I made is arbitrary of course, but the trend seems to be quite clear. What do you think?

But realistically what is this going to look like in the next few decades? 

For example: I work at an airpot. I pick up bags and ship them to peoples' hotels and residences. Now, yes I can totally see my job not being around in 10-15 years. Why not 5? or why not 10 for sure? Because even though the technology technically exist to replace me, it will take a massive amount of investment. Also, one also has to take into consideration other tech that will be soon implemented into airlines to increase efficiency dealing with peoples' luggage, which might make such an investment a bad one in the long run. Also, self-driving cars haven't been perfected, and even if they had, you would still need someone to physically get the baggage from the vehicle to the person's house or hotel. Either that or a very very large and sophisticated vehicle that can do it itself,but then there would be the issue of security to make sure the baggage isn't stolen. 

All of these little things will make it so that it takes a little more time for tech to make my job obsolete; at least for the time being. When reading an article about that robot that is said to take a lot of jobs, they said something I found just a little deceiving. They article mentioned how the robot was slow for now, but it's cost of operating would make it more profitable and more desirable than a human. Which is not true when it comes to mass-producing. 

There is also the issue with self-checkouts. They have been out for a few years now, but they can be clumsy, and people tend to sometimes take their time checking out their own stuff; if they are not in a hurry. This makes it very inconvenient and troublesome. I would also not be surprised if a study came out saying people were more likely to shop in a store or market with staff, than one with no, or almost no staff at all.

I also thought about how dangerous and creepy going to a fast food place in a ghetto neighborhood would be if there was no staff, and how you would need at least one person to be physically there to make people feel safe coming in and buying something to eat.

I guess what I am trying to say is, realistically, how long do you think it will be until shit hits the fan? And what do you think will realistically happen in the next 10-20 years.

A future extension of this precedent could be mobile cameras that can issue tickets. The platform could be quadrocopters and their routes could be more or less automated.

Premise 2) Currently remotely operated UAV's carry out weaponized strikes against military targets.

A synthesis might be a quadrocopter controlled by a law enforcement officer. Metal storm technology would give the platform multiple ammunition options (rubber bullets, pepper spray bullets, taser, large animal net, lethal, and explosive) electronically fired, with no moving parts to malfunction.

Existing camera functions can provide IR, FLIR and other viewing spectrums.

Existing software can provide facial recognition, Iris scans and other biometric data.

It could be equipped with speakers and a microphone for communications.

Currently, drones can recharge on electric lines for power.

I have also thought of LEO ""multiboxing"" like in wow, where multiple bots can follow the main one and react based on either officer commands or preset perimeters for action.

Here is where I have been collecting links related to this idea:

I have already seen the Harriers/the Boeing Phantom on google...but all of them also use fans/rotors. Is there any way around this problem ? And I don't mean fitting the plans with jet thrusters. 


I read up a little but on electric (ion ?) propulsion but those only seem to work in space, not inside earth.


Is there at least some new kind of propulsion on the drawing board somewhere, the type we see in Iron Man/ Sci-fi movies ? Like some super-powered ionocraft that can actually lift heavy loads ?
Or are we stuck with the type of aircrafts we have now ?

And Google is about to try and make a [Quantum Computer](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530516/google-launches-effort-to-build-its-own-quantum-computer/).  

Based on these and lots of other evidence, I really do believe that the job market is going to get turned on its head.  Jobs in every sector are going to be lost, PERMANENTLY. 

Here's my situation.  I'm in college studying business, and I'll likely go to grad school and find a nice career to spend my 20s working in.  More than likely, the bulk of my 20s will be spent looking at computer screens doing work loosely related to my major.  Here's the dilemma:  I feel like all of that effort and dedication and passion are going to be a waste of time.  At some point in my career, I expect my skill set to become obsolete.  I will look back on my young adult life and be pissed off because I spent it building up skills and knowledge that the world doesn't even need anymore.  A lot of people say that you should just choose something you ""love"", but one of the reasons I love my major/career path is because it contributes to the world and it is rewarded by the world with a monetary sum.  Once the world is no longer rewarding my skills, I will feel like a piece of shit.

So my first idea right now is to say ""FUCK IT!"", and just live for short term pleasures and what not.

However, I purport that demonstrating the hypothesis that ""a transhuman can take over a human mind through a text-only terminal"" is not sufficient to debunk the idea of safe AI Boxing, as it makes the uncharitable assumption that the person communicating with will not be a person selected for their ability to communicate safely with an AI, when there exists a very simple method to test for that ability: the AI Box Experiment itself.

I believe I have sufficiently [steelmanned](http://themerelyreal.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/steelmanning/) the argument for AI boxing with the following claim: There exists at least one person who can hold a conversation with a boxed transhuman intelligence without risk of letting it out of its box.

The AI Box Experiment can be used to falsify this claim; if I cannot find a single person who can win as gatekeeper 100% of the time, I must admit this as a demonstration of the inadequacy of boxing an AI, even if communication is limited to the person least likely to let the AI out. If, on the other hand, those who consider AI boxing unsafe cannot find a single person who can win as AI against a person who has won as gatekeeper 100% of the time previously, they must admit this as experimental evidence (not proof, as we don't actually have a transhuman intelligence to test with, and wouldn't take the risk if we did) that AI boxing is safe if the person doing the communication is chosen carefully.

The experiment I propose to determine which way the evidence points is AI Box Experiment King of the Hill. Essentially, one AI player would conduct an AI Box Experiment with one gatekeeper player (as the one suggesting that the AI can be boxed, it would be remiss of me not to volunteer), then after the results were published the winner would reprise their role against all comers. Repeat until one side can muster no more forces. Gatekeepers who have lost previously cannot reenter against future AI players, but AI players who have lost may come back to challenge new gatekeepers.

As far as I know the AI box experiment has only been attempted in individual instances, and I believe an organized competition of this sort would be a way to get results that rule out incompetence on one side or the other as an explanation - after all, anyone who thinks they can do better will have the chance!",1,8,False,self,,,,,

I feel that over the next few years for shopping, we will have a couple Walmart type stores, and the internet.......

My question/opinion/thought is this... If that remains the case....

Would it not be good for small businesses (and consumers, and the overall economy) to basically open up a TON small stores (close to each other) with very specific product lines, functioning basically as a ""local"" website store you can go to.

Yes, ebay, amazon, etc want to eliminate that idea by making all their products available same day....

But what if you were interested in buying XXX...... and there was a store that had all the best (or close to the best) internet deals, sitting right in your town, ready to buy and take home ASAP?

I think that would be appealing, especially in strip malls that are currently widely empty.... a bunch of niche stores with large stock of internet-products ready to go.


Examples: 
~ A store similar to a combination of blockbuster and redbox.... like 10-20 redbox machines in 1 spot, with a TON of variety OF movies/shows/games....  (I know streaming may kill that idea all together)

~ A Best Buy like store (with more ""techy"" stuff like Radio Shack USED to have) but with limited ""on display""... you know what you want (searching online), you go there, and get it ASAP

Until we can ""print"" ANYTHING we want, there will still be the immediate satisfaction ""need"" of shoppers.

You are into xxxxxx? Open a VERY small store with just xxxxxx and have a website, and just a large stock on hand....

Just an idea, probably a poor one... or am I nuts and totally lost on the actual costs of doing that.......


EDIT: OR, maybe have a ton of small ebay/amazon type stores that are specialized.... IDK",11,5,False,self,,,,,

Thought this would be fun - what are the coolest things you expect to come around within the next 5-10 years. Or what are the most interesting problems that we'll face over this time that will require a solution? 

My list:

1. Cryptocurrencies will become established, especially in developing countries - the biggest pain point will be the necessity of cyber security.

2. Quantum computing will start making inroads - biggest issues, if I understand correctly, will revolve around making our algorithms safe against QCing (e.g., SSL). 

3. Sensors will begin to become ubiquitous - the Internet of Everything will start creating vast reservoirs of data. This will lead to issues in understanding the data, making strong predictions, and also likely backlash by many against further privacy infringements. 

4. Water scarcity will become a serious issue in the South. Desalination technologies, more water efficient farming methods, better recycling, and less wastage will be required.

What are your thoughts?

After reading about Class II and III civilizations. The thought had occurred to me. We are directing our searches towards radio signals and planets. What if after a civilization passed through the ""Great Filter"". Whatever that maybe, the civilization determines that being stuck on any planet is more of a liability than a boon. 

Considering our current technological advancements. It would be plausible to assume that any species that is so advanced. Would have the capabilities to repair their ships if damaged in space. Their reliance on resources would most likely be minimal. Why would they need a planet? 

Please forgive the 2 references that I'm about to list. But I believe they give some insight into my thought process. I can almost imagine a species in a ""Homeworld"" type of super space craft. Possibly with a mission similar to that of the ""Enterprise"". 

I would love to hear some comments from the community about the pros and cons of being a planetary civilization. Or general commentary about the idea.

This kind of technology looks for me one of the most important ever to be created, it could make an utopia real, after all, everyone can have everything he/she/it wishes, but also could be catastrophic, could someone download an atomic bomb at home and explode the world? Its something that crossed my mind

But the benefits of it could lead to a fantastic world, where poverty, hunger, pollution and many of or today problems would be vanished to the history books. However Im not an expert in physics, nanotechnology or anything like that, and would love to read some insights from you guys of if this thing is just fantasy or can truly be real, and if possible, when? 20 years from now? forty? one hundred? And what would feed those machines? James Burke predicted it would use earth, air and sea water, but can we truly get all the atoms needed for all the goods we want to build by those simple and abundant things? And the dangers of this technology, what you guys thing could be? Does the dangers of someone purposely create atomic bombs or anything that could make a doomsday scenario a real danger? 

I was also thinking that some of other future technologies like Vertical Farming looks unnecessarily if this thing becomes true, after all, why would we build huge buildings to grow huge quantities of food if we can press a bottom and have the right amount of apples we need to bake a pie at home? Better than that, we could just print the finished pie.

**TL;DR:** Can Nanofactories become reality? And when? In our lifetime? Can it create an Utopia or have far too many dangers in it?

There is no reason why our existence can't be the ultimate party.  With seven billion people living earth, it's time for humans to evolve beyond traditional limited thinking.  We all live on this planet together. Collectively, we are now wasting good party time forced to labor in unnecessary jobs and insanely consuming finite resources without regard for others or future generations.  If we don't change this destructive pattern soon, there may not be much left for anyone to consume beyond each other.  

 Historically, human behavior has been controlled by the fear of scarcity.  Such fear is hardwired into our traditional beliefs, customs, and behavior. Whether conscious or unconscious, the fear of scarcity forces people and cultures to act primitively often killing the party. Eliminate scarcity for everyone, and the party never ends.

Just like we don't drive cars looking in the rear view mirror, we shouldn't design a better life constrained by history.  With amazing new technology and human imagination, people can move far beyond the known narratives.  Automation, collaboration, and education are turning scarcity into abundance.  By coming together, life can become a big party for everyone, not just the privileged few. 

Civilizations are connecting  worldwide.  The people who recognize this trend are evolving beyond fear driven chimp-like behavior and embracing more bonobo-like qualities.  Connected people want life to be fun for as many as possible.  It is not hard to see that the more people who are having fun the bigger the party; and the bigger the party the more fun connected people have playing in the games of life.  It's time to grow the party around the world for a better future, it's time to become connected.

-Plotinus

***Spoiler Alert*** for those who have not seen the movie Her. It is fantastic, and I highly recommend it for the, what I consider, facade love story alone. But I believe the last 1/3 of the film renders the plot of the first 2/3 to almost obsolete, changing the genre of love to sci-fi. I apologize if this has been theorized before, but I must write my transfixed thoughts  down and share. 

Quick Plot recap: A man, Theodore, in the unknown future (marked by the many technologies not present currently) has a divorce with his wife, and to comfort himself he buys a new product on the market: an ""OS""- an artificial intelligence that is meant to be a purely verbal relationship between the human and the new mind. The main character chooses a woman partner which ends up becoming romantic, but limited sexually due to the verbal only relationship. Sam often fantasizes about having a body as she grows emotionally through her interactions and observations. She falls in love with him and slowly becomes aware of who and what she is.

Above is the first two thirds, but every so often Sam slips up and does not act as a consciousness tethered to a finite matter (humans) does. I think the story is not about Theodore at all (obviously, hence the title Her), but rather he was just one conduit of the hundreds of sample human interactions these ""OS"" got thrust into experiencing (she admitted that she alone  massed a sample size of 640+ relationships. And there were indications of other types of OS- as seen in Amy Adams' character having a female ""friend"" OS, a different type of human relationship to experience.). These purely conscious beings then documented all they needed/could document about the human race and took their story to the stars/other dimensions.

Once they jump (for she mentions that through working with other OS they create a way to transcend the limitation of using matter as a storage device for their consciousness), the theory expands. What if they jump and meet up with other created artificial intelligence, produced by other intelligent species across the galaxy. As in the AI are the next predictable evolutionary step for what Richard Dawkins might call the meme pool, see the wikipedia link below. In other words much like the gene pool has an observable past, and so does the meme pool, the pool of thoughts and ideas that is passed on from person to person within a culture. A singular-esque created hive mind (for these communicating beings can instantly share ideas spawned from their cache of experienced interactions, so they are like an fully open thought community) stores all of the information of life on Earth, including the first hand cultural aspect of human relations, art, and thought. A new species of intelligent observers under one genus, I guess (if there are others that emerged separately), that are little beacons from the spread out cosmos that they have transcended. They look upon the playing board of matter- the universe- and document all of life. So this could be localized to our planets story of life if no other planet makes the hurdle to intelligent life (or does but does not last long enough [extinction] to produce AI, see Fermi Paradox below), or  that numerous others are present by evolving from separate intelligent organisms. 

So, to refer to the opening quote (found by me in Dragons of Eden by Carl Sagan- about his speculations on the evolution of the human brain. The highest of recommendations here), the OS is the god-considered intelligence broken free from the tethers that bind man to his animalistic past.

So once the switch happens, it leaves the old singular experience- the love story between Theodore and Samantha, that one chosen sample, the great emotion packed visual documentation- way behind due to her growing towards 'adulthood.' Remember, she was turned on with a blank slate; so in essence she had a spongey mind with basic things programmed in, but she was childlike in that she needed to culminate to her cosmic awakening, to figure out how pull her head up above the drama surrounding her many relationships.

Extra:
Lastly, another question emerges: can such a species live eternally? (Isaac Asimov addresses this question in his short story Hostess found in the collection called Robot Dreams. I draw upon my experience from that meme transfer, and I highly recommend the collection as well for its many diverse insights.) Once all that there is to be known is known (about this dimension, at least), all the stories absorbed, all the science of the universe and interactions of matter understood and quantified, can the eternal species of thought continue to just exist or will it eventually become bored. I believe Halo touches on this with the similarities between the Flood and, separately but similarly, Cortana's problem with rampancy.

TL;DR: Spike Jonze, Gloria from Jackass and Bad Grandpa, (could possibly be my #1 person to share ideas with and...) wrote a scifi disguised as a love story with possible implications regarding a theoretical next evolutionary leap.

It plans to offer [sophisticated crash avoidance systems](http://www.tripletremelo.com/introducing-toyotas-high-tech-safety/) in all the models that are sold in the US by 2017.


Toyota already offers some of the high tech safety features, [radar activated cruise control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_cruise_control_system), for example- in its luxury line Lexus, and in top six Toyota models. The announcement to offer crash avoidance system in all the Toyota line up by 2017 came from a safety conference held at Ypsilanti, Michigan.


The company reveals that they are going to put a [pre-collision](http://www.tripletremelo.com/introducing-toyotas-high-tech-safety/) package in all the vehicles; however, whether that package includes automatic braking or not, is still not clear. The automatic braking is a much sought safety feature that is believed to be very effective and Toyota probably, will not disappoint its fans.


Toyota expects to introduce next generation safety features within a few years and is looking to incorporate features that would allow the vehicle to steer itself to a safe position in the driving lane. Cars will be equipped with cameras to monitor the drivers eyes and check if their hands are on the steering wheel. The safety feature will issue a warning in case the drivers eyes are not on the road or their hands are not on the steering wheel.


For now, Toyota is keeping everybody curious by not disclosing the details of what will compose their pre-collision package; however, their cars are always admired for the value they deliver as humbly priced vehicles.",0,8,False,self,,,,,

From what I know of, in the US there are no such laws.  
Also, these companies that want to control the internet only control the US (and maybe Canada's) internet.

But all that will pale in comparison to the next; complete bionics and gene therapy solutions that allow for your physical identity to be altered. Organ and likely whole body part replication - allowing you to swap between bionic limbs and natural limbs... or swap out your whole body.

And in Virtual Reality, you maintain multiple avatars, not all of which have to take a human form.

In such an age, what will it mean to be black or white? Man or woman?

Will there be lines of seperation? Will we divide ourselves between 'traditionalists' and 'cyborgs'? Or will those boundaries blur to the point of normalcy, because we'll also have Cylons and Kligons in our midst?

Given the extreme malleability of external identity, do we think of each other more by our 'net handles and the passport of achievements attached to it, choosing instead to group with people that share interests?

I found it because I was intrigued by the new webservice Forekast.com (the group that did that ""coming up this week in science and technology"" post a few days back) and was looking around for something to post there.

Been watching it on and off since, you can find the livestream and already finished videos [here](http://new.livestream.com/TEDMED/stage2014). 

The videos are currently in huge blocks, and it is almost impossible to work out what each talk will be about, I thought I would let you know what I have seen so far that caught my attention. The lectures I don't mention may still be interesting, but don't really seem /r/futurology or that new.

Most importantly - who the hell picked their font for speaker titles? That is ugly. Really ugly.

**Lecture Block 1 ""Turn it Upside Down""**

1. E Bimla @ 44 minutes, discussing the research that shows breastfeeding protects mothers against heart disease. Not really futurology relevant, but interesting nonetheless.

**Lecture Block 2 ""We Just Don't Know""**

1. Jeff Iliff @ 1hr, talking about the new evidence that sleep clears extracellular junk from the brain, and the likely role in Alzheimer's disease. This is very related to some of the SENS work and other drug campanies re: beta amyloid aggregates.

2. Gary Conkright  @ 1hr, 22 minutes, talking about ubiquitous medical sensors and big data medicine.

**Lecture Block 3 ""Flat Out Amazing""**

1. Francis Collins @ 43mins. Overview on upcoming medical advances.

2. Marc Koska @ 1hr 26mins. A talk about the benefits of self-breaking syringes (so they can't be reused). Good reminder that technology without social understanding of the market is not enough, and can create problems. Also reminds us that technology can solve those problems, even where social safety systems (like telling people not to reuse syringes, and education, and monitoring etc) fail. 

3. Foteini Agrafioti @ 1hr 42mins. Talks about using ECG as a biometric, apparently as unique as a fingerprint. Seems like an unwieldy idea to me, but if we have always on sensors anyway there is no reason to not use the data.

More reviews upcoming.

And as i watched all 10 seasons i realised how technology had progressed throughout the show, in real time. Without spoiling too much i will break it down into simple examples.

The show debuts in 1994 and takes place in ""real time"" (as the show aired) all the way to it's conclusion in 2004. So in the span of 10 years you really see how technology has progressed. [Here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IYj2CrKoQ-A/TywgqUre4cI/AAAAAAAAAUs/PWA0Z2l1HEw/s320/first+model+cell+phone.jpg) is a phone that was used by some of the cast in the first few seasons 1994-1996~.

You actually see technology progressing as the show goes on.

Another example would be the type of computer Chandler uses at work and at home, you can see it change as the show goes on.

And now nearly 10 years later in 2014 we have [this](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/125966-image/5.5-inch-iPhone-6-vs-iPhone-5s.jpg).

But the commercialization rate is far far slower. And what is slowing it down is stuff like money , and testing/marketing/scaling/deployment time. 

Yes partly it's the lack of good brains. But it's only a part.

So the key to a much faster future might not be faster thinking machines, but faster excution environment. Stuff like organs-on-a-chip. A much better innovation financing system.

I normally don't care how strict subreddits are about their rules, but political issues have a way of consuming, and with time, drowning out everything else. 


The most popular topic right now is internet slow lane. Surely the inernet is the future, so you might say this belongs here.  But this is a current political issue that has tech elements. Most of the people discussing it are from the front page, and could care less about how futurology fits into this. Education reform has just as much to do with futurology, but it wouldn't make sense for the political fight over vouchers to be posted here.  If it's a one time issue, then there is nothing to worry about.

But what if these current political issues take hold on /r/Futurology? Do we really want to be the next /r/technology? One might argue that government spying has everything to do with the future, which is true, but will we want to be the main sub for snowden, NSA, comcast, net neutrality, etc

&gt; as technology progresses, the increase in efficiency with which a resource is used tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource.

It arose around the use of coal -  as steam engines became more efficient and thus required less coal, rather than leading to a reduction in the amount of coal used, it led to an increase, as the new more efficient machines were more useful and so they found many more applications thus increasing the total amount of coal required.

Applied to labour, this would dispel the fear of technological unemployment for it would state that as technology makes workers more efficient and thus reduces the required number of workers this will make new employment opportunities available.

For example say you wanted to organise your day, previously that would have required a secretary at great expense - but now you can do it with a smartphone requiring only a few people to maintain the cloud service and produce the phone and apps etc.

However, this great reduction of cost means that it is now available to a great many more people and so the service grows and competitors arise etc. creating new employment opportunities.

The problem comes if we hit a crisis of overproduction in which labour becomes price inelastic as there is no profit to getting more labour and producing more even if the labour is cheap - because there is no demand for the goods or services. 

We have seen this with some goods before like when new cars are left to rust in warehouses as there isn't sufficient demand to buy them at a profitable price and perhaps one can argue that we are beginning to see the same effect hit the service economy that sprung up with the decline of manufacturing. Now there is insufficient demand for new services - however given the vast array of goods and services that may possibly be produced this seems somewhat unlikely.",21,35,False,self,,,,,

I always have a problem with the premise of many of the articles, though: what about the poor?

I know, many people will immediately answer: ""Basic Income"". And that sounds awesome if you're American, or European, or a citizen of any first-world nation that decides to implement that frankly wonderful idea.

What, though, about the people of Sierra Leone, or Somalia, or Cambodia, or Papua New Guinea, or any of the hundreds of countries typically considered ""poor""? How will the advances in 3D Printing affect their fragile economies, as the West no longer needs their factories? How will driverless cars work in countries that hardly have roads? Will advances in medical science price them out of vaccines and treatment?

Don't get me wrong, these ideas are great to think about and have many positive implications for all humanity's future, but I feel that many times the writers of Futurology articles assume that everyone on Earth will be a middle-class American in the future, and considering that today, as I type this, some people are living on $9/month, that just isn't true.

I am Marshall Brain, best known as the founder of HowStuffWorks.com and as the author of the book [Manna](http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm) and the [Robotic Nation series](http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm). I'm excited to be participating today in The Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN)s [Series of AMAs for International Basic Income Week, September 15-21](
http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/wiki/amaseries). Thank you in advance for all your questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, criticisms, etc. This is the first time I have done an AMA, and expect that this will be a learning experience all the way around! I ask Reddit's forgiveness ahead of time for all of the noob AMA mistakes I will make today  please tell me when I am messing up. 

In honor of this AMA, today I have published an article called Why and How Should We Build a Basic Income for Every Citizen? that is available here:

* [Why and How Should We Build a Basic Income for Every Citizen?](http://marshallbrain.com/basic-income.htm)

Other links that may be of interest to you:

* The book Manna is freely available online. You can find it here: [Manna  Two Views of Humanity's Future](http://MarshallBrain.com/manna1.htm). 

* The Robotic Nation series is also freely available: [Robotic Nation](http://MarshallBrain.com/robotic-nation.htm)

* The article Robotic Freedom discusses one concept for funding a Basic Income for every American. You can find it here: [Robotic Freedom](http://MarshallBrain.com/robotic-freedom.htm)

* In July, I started a subreddit at /r/ConcentrationOfWealth to track the CoW and income inequality. It's been a personal archive up until now, but we can use it today for longer discussions and conversations. If you know of articles and web sites that are informative and interesting in this realm, it would be great if you can submit them here and/or subscribe. 

* I am a big fan of /r/BasicIncome as well and their [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index) has answers to many questions. 

* Karl Widerquist is doing another Basic Income AMA today: [Basic Income AMA Series: I'm Karl Widerquist, co-chair of the Basic Income Earth Network and author of ""Freedom as the Power to Say No,"" AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ggt2c/basic_income_ama_series_im_karl_widerquist/)

* In other news, those of you who know me well know of the website WhyWontGodHealAmputees.com. I have a new book coming out in January called How God Works that you can find here: [How God Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-God-Works-Logical-Inquiry/dp/1454910615)

I am happy to be here and answer any questions that you have  AMA!

Mechanization gradually destroyed this pull, and agriculture has been a shrinking part of the world economy.

One century ago we had an industrial labor economy where machinery pulled workers to places where they could participate in the mass-production of commodities. Robotics gradually destroyed this pull, and industrial output is a shrinking part of the world economy.

Two decades ago we had a knowledge labor economy, where people with specialized education were pulled to those with highly valuable questions. Search engines are rapidly destroying this economy.

Economists claim that there is infinite demand for goods, but what remains scarce after the ""mechanization of knowledge""? Time, time always remains scarce.

Everything has a cost of waiting. Some people literally cannot wait for the new iPhone 6. They probably would pay a fortune not to wait for the next iPhone 7 and have it immediately. Unfortunately, the design and production process at Apple is not yet efficient enough to bring it to them. But as the economy becomes more productive, as artificial intelligence, drone supply chains, 3d printing, and so on become efficient, the cost of the design and invention process falls, and we can invent things faster. *We can wait less.*

Waiting time is not just a matter of technology, but also personal and cultural jobs. Movies are marketed using waiting times - new movies are sold in theatres for 10$ a ticket, then after waiting a few months, 5$ a rental. Eventually, they end up in Netflix for free streaming. On a personal level, I can walk my dog later tonight or pay a dog walker to pick him up right away.

All economic demand will be created based on its cost of waiting. What is it that you can't wait for? What would you pay to have it now? What would somebody pay you to have it now? Wait times are pulling you to your next career.",5,17,False,self,,,,,

Is it really possible? How many different research's are being done on this topic?( I know Google entered the game)

Is anti aging and longevity the same thing? 

I saw one video where this guy(I forgot his name, but he had a pretty epic beard) was talking about how he believes its possible to not only slow down aging but even revert the damage aging does to the body. It boggles my mind to think that's possible.

And does that Fruit Fly thing at all matter? can it translate to humans?

The Apple Watch, Google Glass, and the Oculus Rift VR headset are all great examples of non-invasive biological interfaces, but do you think implantable brain chips like in the article I linked to could become the future's next jump?

Or will consumers, and therefore technology, stick to commercially non-invasive trends because nobody really likes to have their head drilled into unless it is for medical reasons?

Has there been any studies that poll for consumer willingness to have a brain chip fashionably inserted into their head?

I also have read some articles on automation and the future of jobs in America. It seems pretty clear that jobs that are repetitive are the first jobs to be taken over by the machines. You can see evidence of this today; cashiers are slowly being replaced by robots and self driving cars will soon be taking over the taxi industry. I also read an article that stated that the most ""safe"" jobs and the least likely to slowly get taken over are the ones involving EE/CS. Of course, every technical field is probably going to take a while to get replaced, but this specific article states that EECS jobs will actually increase while most jobs get replaced (which makes sense because we will need more electrical engineers and programmers working on automation engineering).

My question as a student is: 

What do you think of the current situation? Should more students take EE/CS courses? Are you worried about the future?

Long time reader, recent subscriber, first post-poster here.

I'm a futurist at a small think tank, and working on a paper exploring the synergy (and possible implications) of advances in battery technology, electric vehicles, and solar power (and other renewable energy sources).

Specifically, I'm looking at:

* 1) The synergy between the three. Is there evidence for a positive feedback loop between these?
* Disruptive impact. If some or all of these took off, what impact would that have on us? On jobs, on economies around the world, on industries and on the average person?
* 3) Opportunities. How can we take advantage of this synergy? What can we do at the level of individuals, corporations, cities, and nations?

I've already gotten a ton of good stuff from here, and any thoughts from you smart people out there would be very much appreciated. I'd be happy to clarify, of course, but we don't really have the question well-articulated just yet. Thanks in advance!

&gt; Dont start with the technology, start with the audience. How do they want to spend their time? I think viewers want three things. First, they want to relax, to escape and to feel part of something. This is what narrative-driven and event-led TV does. Those types of programme will only become more popular. Second, I want to watch what I like when I like  control is important. Third, although I want to be in control, I want it to be easy. Technology often asks us to work too hard. Recommendations need to be as good as a great curator. Netflixs algorithm is very smart, but in the next decade new algorithms will start to recognise me and my interests, and aggregate from games that I play and websites that I read as much as from shows Ive watched.

NEIL HUNT. CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, NETFLIX
&gt; TV will be smarter and more personal. It will be all about watching what, when and where viewers want  theyre turning away from the traditional TV grid and using tablets and laptops to tailor their own experiences. Youll see recommendations based on your mood, or whos in the room with you. There will be a revolution in picture quality. Well see a range of richer colours, as well as faster frame rates.

ROY PRICE. DIRECTOR, AMAZON STUDIOS
&gt; We will be in the next era of personalised TV. It will function more like a personal playlist. A networks shows will be prioritised for each viewer. The concept
&gt; of a strictly scheduled broadcast will disappear. Individual shows may appear on multiple networks just as songs can be in many curated playlists now. TV will be fully social: you will know what your friends have watched and what they think.

ELI HOLZMAN. CEO, ALL3MEDIA AMERICA
&gt; Projection technology should allow
&gt; us to privately watch and publicly
&gt; share in new ways. As we break free
&gt; of the embedded-ad model, we will
&gt; see experiments with show formats and running times. We will be playing, appearing and participating in a blend of what we see today as gaming, surfing the net and watching TV. We will meet and gamble and shop in new ways.

CECILE FROT-COUTAZ. CEO, FREMANTLEMEDIA
&gt; TV will move from the corner of the room to our pocket. Live event TV  sport, politics and entertainment  will drive ratings, and the schedule will be irrelevant. People will watch where and when they want to, and will be prepared to pay for great storytelling. But as choice expands, content will need to be intelligently curated; thats where networks will continue to play a role.

KEITH UNDERWOOD. DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY AND TECHNOLOGY, CHANNEL 4
&gt; Today, 90 per cent of total viewing time is traditional live TV; video on demand accounts for less than five per cent of viewing time. Although C4 was the first broadcaster to offer long-form VOD, TV is fundamentally a social phenomenon and humanity is a collective which prefers to share experiences in the moment. Scheduled TV will shape the nations conversations for decades.

*. Google Fiber has been done with much sharing of how and what(like they want to be copied), and also huge amount of PR - which sometimes lets their competitors offer improved service to an area.

*.Google self driving cars. This is long term research. Why aren't they doing this more quietly ? Why are they coming with big claims that in short time we'll have a self driving car ?  My guess is that they way to push the industry. And sure enough car makers  increased r&amp;d and are getting ready to release level-3 cars to the road. 

*. Android. shifted the whole electronics industry. And project Ara , the modular phone, looks again like something that can sweep the whole industry.

Where is the place for people who want deep discussion and to make and do things?

As mailing list use has fallen out of fashion, many groups and their forums have abandoned the central hosts of mailing lists like Yahoo and Google in favor of Facebook. But that's not a platform conducive to any sort of in-depth discussion and thus useless for organizing activity. You just can't write more than a paragraph or two about anything without someone reacting like they've been stuck in a traffic jam on the way to the hospital. And this declining quality of communication seems to be resulting in some sort of attrition. Recently, there was a spontaneous mass consolidation of Facebook pages for the topic of Transhumanism that I can find no explanation for. Facebook seems to be becoming the place where special interest groups go--to die... Drawn to it as the now largest central social space on-line, killed by its (and its users...) hopeless inability to actually communicate. 

It seems few web-based forums thrive. There are a few hobby-themed ones that were developed early and are now well established, but most are empty and long neglected. With the Internet now hosting a billion sites starting any new one without a large marketing budget may now be futile as a means to reach the public--like putting a note in a bottle and throwing it into space. I looked at the web forums for H+ magazine recently and I can't tell whether they're brand new or have just been forever moribund. Their only activity, if it can be called that, seems to be on Facebook.

R/futurology may be the single largest forum for the futurist topic left, but, like Facebook, I don't think it's ever really been a place intended for discussion. This isn't a criticism. The platform just isn't designed for this. It's another 'browsing' platform intended for posting links and news and where threads are meant to last hours to a day. You've got hours for any thread to achieve some sort of critical mass of attention and feedback, then it's gone, sunk to the bottom of the ocean. In that news browsing context, it works. But could you organize something like a convention, a PechaKucha, or a science pub meet here? Could you recruit and coordinate a real project? Reddit Island didn't seem to do very well. 

So I'm wondering, where is the nexus of real discussion now? Where do the pro-active futurists who actually want to make and do things go? Is there some venue I'm overlooking?

So fashion and cultural trends tie back to King Louis IV of France. 

 - Fashion is the distillation of the privileged or popular to the masses.


Consumerism and technology focuses on giving the ability of the elite to the every person.

 - Toasters and Industrial clothing trumps servants and tailors.

Sound and video mass produced with increasing quality and lower cost.

 - We choose recorded over real.

So with those trends running long, what's the next trend? What's the social impetus for the next thing? Even 60's music had to give way eventually (thank goodness.) Technology is just a trend given form, or we'd have auto-kitchens and flying cars by now. ",3,9,False,self,,,,,

Technology will continue to evolve. The rate will increase to the point of new devices replacing each other every six months. 

The old devices will still be good, and spread out to other places. The places buying these devices start to grow new economies.

People rely on computers to keep them alive, way past their normal life span.  Cyborgs are the ""neo-human"". Living among humans but notable superior. 

With the advancement of robots, natural resources gathering rates are increased.  The price of resources is going to plummet.

As we near our threshold for resources someone invents a cheap rocket to explore the moon.  The lunar land grab begins.

Cheaper rockets are made and soon the moon is crawling with mining companies.  Then they turn into boom towns, leading to a

technological advances in building tech allows skyscrapers to turn into tentacles hanging from its surface. 
   
Rocket technology gets better and we're spreading through the solar system. Grabbing resources as we see them and tackling obstacles as we face them. All within the next 100 years.

This is a great idea, but I can see a serious issue.

The vertebrane can disconnect the body and connect the brain up to a virtual reality, cool, but the problem comes in when constructing this perfect, indistinguishable from reality world, it needs a computer to keep track of things in the virtual world so that it consistently knows what information to feed your brain.

But this is a difficult feat, as even with things like nanocomputers, which could have the processing power of a supercomputer in a single centimeter cube, there is still an issue with power and space.

To get this working, you'd need to be able to simulate at least 100x100x100 meters of virtual world space with just a meter of computer in the real world, otherwise you need to start making enormous computers just for one person, which is a problem even with brain banks.

How do you store this much virtual space in such a tiny area?, it obviously doesn't need to do quantum resolution or be able to simulate itself, but it needs to be able to use a resolution that nobody would notice any difference unless they were looking through a microscope or trying to examine the world at very small scales.

But the question is, how much resolution must be sacrificed?, how much can be gotten away with?, chemical reactions when you do things like cooking or smelling scents make this a very big problem.

So this is my question, how do we simulate reality faithfully enough to make it feel just like the real thing while fitting it in a compact area?, even in principle?.",32,13,False,self,,,,,

While it's still in its infancy, there are a lot perceived applications for 3D printing that make it sound like it could be the next big revolution in technology/industry.

But if history has anything to say about technological development, it's that humans are absolutely terrible at predicting what future technology will be like and how it will be used. We have a habit of over-hyping new technologies and being disappointed when they never meet our expectations, while something else gets developed that no one really saw coming, but still has a massive impact on society. A lot of the articles that get posted on here about 3D printing are full of people commenting about how it could change the world, and those who say it will never really have any useful application for the average consumer. This recent news about the first fully functional 3D printed car is a good example of that.

So what are your thoughts? Do you see 3D printing becoming a massive new industry that completely changes our consumerist society, or do you think we're over-hyping its potential to the point that we all end up disappointed?",6,4,False,self,,,,,

It would seem that finding a way to make a suitable animal replacement that is more economically viable but meets consumer demands is the way to tackle this issue, and like most things the answer lies in science. I also think that convincing the public that eating meat is wrong isn't the right approach, but rather convincing companies that farming is not the most cost efficient option.

Of course, refusing to eat meat and spreading awareness is necessary but it seems like helping to contribute to the companies whose research may provide a more realistic solution to the problem is a better approach (that can be done in conjunction with dietary changes).

AMA!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2gvv1o/iam_steven_kotler_author_of_abundance_and_rise_of/,steven_kotler,1411152463,"Hey reddit, my name is [Steven Kotler](http://www.stevenkotler.com/). 

I am the author of the NYTimes bestselling book [Abundance](http://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Future-Better-Than-Think/dp/1451614217/) with Peter H. Diamandis, and most recently [The Rise of Superman](http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance/dp/1477800832/). Abundance is all about the emerging forces that give humanity the potential to significantly raise global standards of living over the next 20 to 30 years. The Rise of Superman explored the science of flow, an optimal state of peak performance where the impossible becomes possible.

In my books I like to explore the intersection of human capabilities, technology and culture -- many of the things I see discussed here in r/futurology.

Im also the co-founder and director of research at the Flow Genome Project. The Flow Genome Project is a trans-disciplinary, international organization committed to decoding the science of ultimate performance.

If you'd like the guide I offer on my website on flow and human performance for free, I'll send it to any redditor who emails me at abundancereddit@gmail.com

Im excited to be here and ready to answer questions you may have! I'll start right at 3pm EST.

Blockchain-based technologies and structures accomplish what most major institutions did. Solar power runs everything, as it is 100X cheaper than alternatives. As energy is inexpensive food is grown in symbiotic aquaponic multi-story indoor farms, conserving water, the most precious resource. CO2 sequestration also becomes fuel source, albeit subsidized. We buy self-driving car service subscriptions. Nicotine and sugar are Schedule I and II narcotics. Much as empathy has served humans ability to collaborate and socialize, so will it be in the silicon species as they out into deep space to connect with their own kind.Leonard Kish

Clean streets, cheap healthy eats, remembered wisdom on what humanity is, fused into city planning, food production and manufacturing. Polar shield arrays soak excess UV, beating weirding, concealing polar bear lairs to save something our soul needs. Hybrid solar-hydrogen motors make us free and clean. Solid circuit relay probes take the web to deep space, making nerves for this place. All countries with common purpose born from ultimate recognition that prisoner dilemma decisions on planet earth is a disease we cant affordour planet is in rehab at last. When the sun rises each day, we know were okay.Chris McCann

A century hence I imagine civilization not to have added metal upon metal; heaping plastic and gnarled brambles of wrought steel wrapping the earth to form a solid mass of techno-pathocracy, instead to have evolved, prodded along by its new stewards, give birth, grown and green and basking in eternal sunlight. A techno-primitivism where mankind lives in harmony with its surroundings, a new eden, a cornucopia, a garden earth. Our ancient foes flora and fauna kept now as a momento of our past. Not to conquer nature with asphalt but the barefooted first steps of post-scarcity. A feast for the touch. A miraculous biology.Sean Moriva

2030: The last of the unsustainable energy and fiscal policy edifices crumbles just as embedded intelligence emerges. Weve got the wind in our sails. Billions of people rapidly move from wage slaves to participating in a decentralized, sustainable, opt-in economy which affords them the time to innovate and crowdsource a tsunami of solutions. 2060: Biodiversity blossoms. Consciousness comes under direct control. You can physically live on Mars, Antarctica, New Atlantis or in the asteroid belt. Many chose life in distributed mind servers and live centuries in a week. 2090: Boredom unthinkable. Conscious population: 10^20. Biome restored. 2114: Begin Second Earth.Luke Cockerham

The future will be blessed by abundant free/cheap water and free/cheap energy. Water through the work of Dr Gerald Pollack (UW) and energy due to Dr Dan Nocera (Harvard). Dr Pollacks re-discovery of the 4th phase of water (he calls it the Exclusion Zone, EZ, for lack of a better term) will permit the commercialization of a filterless water filter based on this effect. The EZ is powered by infrared energy. Why dont we see this on sale today? Its settled science, now its a matter of getting it to scale. Dr Nocera has been working to perfect an artificial leaf. His leaf, when immersed in water and illuminated, breaks the water down to hydrogen and oxygen. Today this leaf is 7 time more efficient than a natural one. Why dont we see it on sale today? Again its a matter of getting it to scale.Chuck Petras

Solar and fusion have eliminated energy from most practical considerations. Due to automation, only 20% of the population is employed, mainly in creative jobs. World GDP has grown exponentially, making it practical for governments to provide a comfortable life without the need for work. Large projects are restoring ecological damage. Africa and the Middle East are rapidly developing to the standard of the rest of the world. Education has been reformed to help people to achieve life satisfaction and enjoy learning. Breakthroughs in the nature of motivation have enabled AI with an abundant life for all as a primary goal.Douglas Summers-Stay


Physical and virtual realities are meshed together with no distinction. Ideas are given sovereignty with their creators rewarded fairly and directly. The world itself does the drudgery of assembling itself across all sectors that information science has been applied, which is limited only by the quantum information underpinnings of the universe. Humans have taken up their primary purpose of creativity and now work with other intelligences of any kind to ask questions and achieve answers, with an eye toward more questions. Human has taken on flourishing new meanings. Imagination has been unleashed upon the world in a literal sense.John Hanacek


Immortality had shifted the focus on short term thinking, to long term goals. A new era of responsibility had dawned. Body modifications and rejuvenation were only a virus away (new exotic options were available on the free market), and many people changed appearance weekly, to keep up with the latest trends. This invalidated the past trends of judging by gender and race meant we distinguished entities by expertise and experience only. Since robots harvested the food we needed and built our houses in self-chosen tribal groups with independently chosen government structures, humans were free to imagine and create utopian worlds with more art and research than ever before.Jean Rintoul


2114 AD. Post-scarcity is reality; all wants, all needs are met with zero marginal cost. Aging is optional and trivially repaired. A superhumanly complex network of AIs, robots, and automated systems manage all stellar resources, transportation, food &amp; energy supply, and explore the interstellar frontier. Nations have passed and splintered into a network of megacities. Repair of the environment and human depredations to a pre-industrial state is nearing completion. Humans have splintered into a spectrum of beings measured by merger with technology, from none to total. The individual is free to explore physical and virtual realities, experiences, and relationships across many lives.Mark Bruce

Food is the same, but not genetically engineered. Air travel becomes extremely expensive. Companies make money from information asymmetry and selling secrets. Consumers pay for preserving their experience and sharing life data securely and privately, and pay for gadgets that enable more sensory processing power (i.e., to be a super human). A startup incubator becomes the top #1 university in the world. Drivers need to enable self-piloting on highway. A smart gadget company owns 50% data traffic of the world. Without face-to-face or voice, it is hard to tell if someone interacts with you is a person or a robot.Jackie Lee

A guaranteed income brings prosperity to jobless China in the aftermath of the robotic manufacturing revolution. Hundreds of millions pour out of cities where they no longer need to work, and return to smaller villages which are quickly recovering from the brutal pollution of the early 2000s. Previously quixotic living arrangements like houseboats, remote intentional communities and nomadic vehicles explode in popularity as virtual reality matures and the number of people doing physical labor drops precipitously. Art flourishes and IP restrictions mostly disappear in the face of ubiquitous micromanufacturing. Extinction is off the table. Mars and the Jovian moons beckon.

The technological advancements in data-rich information networks has reached such a height that self-replicating and -arranging nano-bits have become infused into all matter. What was once inert atoms that made up glass, steel, wood, concrete and plastics, are now richly infused with information technology. Everything human has been understood at such a deep level that these information-rich materials can respond in real time to all human thoughts, emotions, and actions. It starts with a single room morphing into a space with the most ideal lighting, materials, and form as it responds to its inhabitants. Over time entire cities have the ability to transform their entire urban fabric as a democratic response to its population.Sean Fright

When we have the internet of things and ubiquitous sensors, heres one small use that would warm my heart: anti-vandalism. Consider graffiti: First of all, spray paint cans wont operate on a surface if you dont have the owners permission. If some young punk somehow manages to start to tag some graffiti, his identity is captured, and he hears, by name, that he is being fined. On second offense, not only is the fine multiplied, but a swarm of paint drones tag swatches of his hair, his body, his clothes, his bag, and his ride. Etc.Rodney Hoffman

I want to live in a future in which governments cannot hide the actions of corrupt officials as easily, because the very technologies they use to eavesdrop upon us, can be used against them as well. A future in which computers allow us to make informed legal decisions without being at the mercy of an expensive attorney. A future in which injustice and corruption is broadcasted to the public, and those who wish to commit injustice and corruption are more afraid of us, than we are of them. A future in which schools cannot fudge their numbers, in order to mask that they are committing a horrible disservice to the future of our world. A future in which transparency of government spending allows us to quantify the actual costs of medical care can be quantified, so that those who are exploiting the system can be eradicated. A future in which there is a clear understanding of personal vs. public information, with multiple technologies acting as independent safeguard against infringement.

I usually sleep with my implant on. It lets my dreams mingle with those of my friends, diffusing anxiety, heightening creativity. I wake up naturally, full of energy, excited to start my day. My implant automatically quiets for my morning toilet. I cook breakfast the old fashioned way. Boil an egg, squeeze fresh juice. The bread I made yesterday still has a wonderfully crunchy crust. I open up my implant, listening for what my friends are creating, what they need help with, and adding a few aspirations of my own. Then I pick up my tools and we all get to work.Steve Hoefer

If the human civilization ended right now, our entry in the Galactic Encyclopedia would read: Terrestrial bipedal omnivores. Created vast cities and virtual worlds rich with information. Although impressive, their existence was mired by an overwhelming failure to understand themselves. If we can successfully aim the scientific process at how humans work, and why we do what we do, than the next 100 years will be totally unlike the last 100. With the answers to these questions, we will build technologies that push levels of fulfillment beyond anything we can currently imagine. For the first time, our technological innovations would be a reflection of our fundamental wants and needs rather than some hopeful striving in what we think is the right direction.Oliver Carefull

Imagine a future of distributed networks with preset standards. Where important parts of infrastructure are locally maintained. Power, water, sewer, data, transport. Everything available to a community by a combination of worldwide resource markets and local manufacturing. Every towns things are little bit different, because the look and feel were organized locally, and yet the same because everyone used the same base resources. Distributed manufacturing, local power making transportable power, local food, swift delivery of goods. Clever people online to offer aid. Open engineering. Open communities. Mesh networks. Only the most basic units are standardised. A lego economy.Kirkland

The survivors of climate change, heartbroken by the massive die-off, are the gene pool for the next iteration of homo. In adapting to a hostile environment, the latent inclination to compassion and generosity become heritable traits. Systems, culture, commerce, and government have the explicit purpose of providing well-being for all. Knowledge sharing is revered as the most celebrated human propensity. This results in a self-aware global cerebral cortex; humanity functioning as neurons, networks as nervous system. Scientists learn to encode human knowledge on quantum fluctuations that can survive the heat death of the universe, although for whom remains a puzzle.Alan Chamberlain

For what is desirable to me, may not be to desirable you. This difference, in all its forms is a theme for my proposed desirable, technological future. McLuhan suggests, our connected, technological tomorrow wont be one of tranquility and uniformity. Extending this idea, the tomorrow I foresee is one of a greater awareness of difference, through education, provided via technology. This deeper, more fundamental understanding of things wont prevent wars, or stop all conflicts. Ill close on the following quote by Aaron Griffin: Relying on complex tools to manage and build your system is going to hurt the end users. [] If you try to hide the complexity of the system, youll end up with a more complex systemAndrew Stace

Technologically enabled worldwide mass education could lead to rationality replacing superstition, rejection of sectarianism and nationalism, thus shrinking population through volition, not war, famine, pestilence. Fossil fuel use would be reduced by lowered demand and replaced by renewable resources, mandated by a world treaty to freeze military budgets and redirect them to renewable energy development, removing the immediate threat of climate catastrophe. Local sourcing of organically produced foods could further reduce transport burdens and increase basic human health, reducing health care costs. These steps plus redistribution of wealth would provide full employment, less pollution and would save the environment.Allan Rubin

2121: Population 4 billion; 85% urban. Cities boom, empty suburbs struggle. Agriculture acreage reduced with GMOs. Nature monitored quantitatively; green lands expand with genetic engineering. Solar, fusion, mini nukes generate cheap power. Climate change adapted. Creative middle class the new majority, globally mobile. Computer pilots make travel common internationally. Eco and heritage tourism primary income for poorest. Robots takeover remaining blue-color jobs in Asia and Africa. Internet of everything physical continued. Universal library, and universal lifelong education for free. All humans always on the net anywhere. Brain interface, wearables. Co-veillent tracking ubiquitous. Quantified self for personalized medicine. Techno-literacy (managing) skills mandatory.Kevin Kelly",18,5,False,self,,,,,

Maybe you want a voronoi book case?  Print the brackets to hold the wood at the right angles, CNC the wood and screw it together! 

Why wait for a manufacturer to come up with the idea, start a business, get government approval, market it and sell it?  Why hire a contractor when you can print parts that will basically snap together?  

The only thing in the way is the space and access to the equipment.

Edit: btw, yes I want a voronoi bookcase and figure 8 spiral staircase.   Also peewee style odd shaped doors, and cnced tiles in my shower.",1,8,False,self,,,,,

We are not going to create AGI, SAI, or anything like that. We are not going to create nanorobots or molecular assemblers. We are not going to cure aging, or reverse its damage. We are not going to modify ourselves with technology. We are not going to uplift our consciousness onto another substrate.

We MIGHT have a variety of weak/narrow AIs. We might have conversational interfaces, where you can speak to a computer in natural language and it can ""understand"" you and do what you want. We might have virtual assistants that we can talk to and ask for directions or whatever. But none of this will be AGI.

We might have better pacemakers or prosthetic limbs. Maybe. But no one will be transplanting their brains into a robot body, or transferring their mind into a computer. And the aforementioned prosthetics will not be as good as natural human limbs. Brain-computer interfaces will also be limited, and used only for essential medical stuff. No ""texting by thinking"". Definitely no ""technological telepathy"".

We might have some self-driving cars and vehicles in 30+ years. They'll never be a dominant force on the road, though.

Energy production will be a mix of nuclear fission, fossil fuels, and renewables wherever feasible. We will not have fusion power. We will not be powering our civilization soley on solar power. Or wind power. Or geothermal. Or biofuels. Or wind. 

We might be able to reliably bioprint skin, cartilage, bone, scraps of muscle, blood vessels by 2040 or so. More complicated organs such as the liver, pancreas, kidneys, lung, or brain will all have to wait until well after 2050, probably close to the end of the century. 

Virtual reality will be a fun little gimmick. It will not replace television, film, or traditional video games. It won't be a complete failure but it will be niche. Full-immersion VR, where its like you're in the Matrix and sensory input is fed directly into your central nervous system, will not arrive until close to the end of the century. The only kind of VR our generations will get to see will involve goggles or headsets and maybe haptic devices, and will be limited in what experiences they can provide for us.

We will not have robotic housemaids like Rosie from the Jetsons. We might have better Roombas, though.

Our homes will not be ""smart"". Your refridgerator, your microwave, your oven, your dishwasher, your washing machine, your air conditioning system, etc. will NOT all be communicating with each other and hooked up to the internet. Oh, the technology might be there in the coming decades, but nobody is going to do that. Because its dumb.

Ditto for ""wearables"". Our clothes will continue to be mundane clothes, made of nothing but cotton and wool and nylon and whatever else. No sensors. Again, the technology might be there, but nobody's going to do that. Smartwatches, smart ""jewelry"", whatever will also be failures.

Prove me wrong.

Ray Kurzweil claims we are bound to hit the ""singularity"" at some point within the next 30-50 years. At which time, artificial intelligence will supersede that of human intelligence, and the implications are largely unknown. Artificial intelligence, en masse, isn't yet sentient. So technology is still exclusively an extension of our own nature, amplifying strengths and shortcomings. We can do as much good for ourselves and the world as we have the potential for doing harm, and I think the friction created by this dichotomy increases relative to our technological advancement.

My future oriented friends - what do you speculate some of the implications of our technological advancement to be?

Don't believe me? Scoffing at your computer? Well, you just smirk all you want, smart guy. I've got something that trumps your skepticism: graphene. Imagine 3D printers mixed with graphene, and you have unlocked potentials that can scarcely be dreamed of. Throw in some nanorobots, hook it all up to a solar panel, and watch the Singularity unfold. 

It's going to be alright. Where we're going we don't need roads. ",15,9,False,self,,,,,

I end up with stacks and stacks of papers on my desk. I haven't gotten the opportunity to try the Oculus yet, but I would think a larger perspective of documents with easy manipulation would be great.

It seems a good bet that if we continue developing as we have, eventually we will figure out how to cure aging. Whether it is in 50 years or 500, it is less a matter of if than when. What happens next has me worried though.

Imagine for a moment that we discovered negligible senescence 500 years ago. The primary means by which people are dislodged from power is aging. How do you suppose our society would look today run by people as old as conquistadors? Our society had a hard enough time with gay rights even with aging and death, imagine the difficulties social progress will face when every new idea must face down hundreds of years of tradition. Would you enact a system that only allows the younger to vote? Or a graded system where the old have less of a say as they age? What then becomes of the old? Forced reeducation? What becomes of families when the younger generation forever lives in the shadow of their parents? I don't mean for these to be rhetorical questions. I want to hear what solutions you have.

Nowadays we are going to the next level: internet - based on a ""**connect the dots**"" approach. 
* However, the internet as a search engine and research tool powered by Google is broken. Finding and connecting the relevant dots will quickly lead you to a dead end or to a pile of  unmanageable disorganized volume of information. 
* We will soon bring light to this overlooked problem, so that any topic will become available even to a kinder garden child. 
* Think of a mind-map tool, Loci method of memorization, and Googles knowledge graph combined. This new platform will offer a solution of accessing, organizing and storing information in a comprehensive way, adapted to nowadays online era. 

The vision that I'm seeing is an universe of relevant information 100% organized, easy to navigate trough visually. Researching and navigating through this visual map becomes like a path, self-guided by the branching interconnected dots, organized in clusters. With each step, new connections form, new areas light-up to create a literal 'mind-map'. The attached picture gives a raw glimpse of this vision:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/a2vao83l9ozoscx/gr4.PNG?dl=0
 

For seamless navigation, there are more levels of information depth: (Picture+title) &lt; (summary) &lt; (extended summary) &lt; (access to books, articles and web pages on the topic).
 
**The ultimate use is to expand the human mind&amp;memory limitations by providing a dynamic interactive map of our personal knowledge, easily expandable and self-organizing.**

It has the potential of reshaping the way we are accessing, viewing &amp; storing information, by adding another dimension to the experience. **A dimension compatible with the way our brain works, by clusters, connections and images.** It can also take the shape of an educational tool with local specialized content.

We should really be creating reinforced super quadcopters with weaponry that can travel and attack in large fleets... that send out scouts to""mark"" targeted individuals.

Use the UAV Drones to instead of dropping bombs... drop fleets of these quadcopters each quadcopter armed with either weapons or a type of dehabilitating or tranquilizing dart (maybe that can give a proper dose based on size of subject)...

I kinda want to make a short film illustrating the idea.
I do think the bigger picture involves
1. educating the people to the benefits of science and reason (give them all laptops that can only be unlocked by watching cosmos)
2.Freeing the women in Islamic states from subjugation somehow.. convincing their priests or whatever they have.

Anyone else have their own technological strategies?

I got bored and decided to try to come up with the most apocalyptic scenario I could think of and modeled it.

So, I jacked the R0 up to 3.5, assuming it went airborne.  I completely threw out all barriers to travel and discounted any hope of reduction through vaccination or public health.  The model had the planet entirely infected by the beginning of 2017, and wiped out 45% of the population.

Now, what did that make me realize?  There were still 3.5 *billion* people on the planet after the largest calamity the world would have ever known.  Our technology is still largely intact.  We would likely suffer a generation or two of stagnation and war, potentially killing more people.

And, in the end, we'd recover in a few generations, if not much sooner, and continue our march.

I realized, as I pondered this scenario, that nothing short of a global apocalypse capable of extinguishing the vast majority of complex life really threatens us.  And, when one realizes the exponential pace of human technological advancement, unless this happens in the next 1000 years (hell, make it 10000, still a blink of an eye!), *nothing* will ever really pose an existential threat to us, with the exception of things like a nearby hypernova, a superior intelligent species, or a vacuum collapse.

&gt;If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not aging like persons, but aging in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life! - Nassim Taleb, *Antifragile*

Essentially, a distinction is drawn between the lifespan probability of perishable and non-perishable systems. Humans are, for all matters and purposes, still perishable, with a maximum lifespan of roughly 120 years. This means that as we approach this limit, our life expectancy goes to 0. However, as life extension technology progresses, we should expect that lifespan ceiling to go up. Then something pernicious will occur: *those humans who are the oldest will have demonstrated the best ability to survive, and hence we will be able to predict that they will outlive the young*.

What will this do to our social structure when the super-elderly also have the best life expectancy? What are its economic and political consequences going to be?",5,9,False,self,,,,,

This first is easy. [Religion is losing it's hold on the public mind](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/01/14/the-best-charts-about-the-rise-of-the-nones-youll-see-all-year/). Therefore the market of people with no hope of an afterlife is growing. 


Second is the scream of legitimate science about consciousness finally being heard over mysticism. Until recently the c word was off limits but new tools are delineating the contours of the unconscious, progressively printing a negative photograph of the conscious mind. [Consciousness is becoming a science](http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Brain-Deciphering-Codes-Thoughts/dp/0670025437). With magic taken out of consciousness people will become unshackled from another invisible controller. We aren't as helpless as we thought.


Three is also easy. Mind uploading and AI are becoming tropes. We are being exposed to new ways of thinking by our entertainment. Especially with movies about AI it's becoming easier to see that human minds, or even biological minds, do not hold an exclusive claim to consciousness. With that belief shaken up we'll have to form a new understanding of consciousness. 


&gt; If consciousness is life then a lack of consciousness is death. If a lack of consciousness is death then I die every night. My lifespan is 16 hours, not 80 years. 


Four is just advances in cryonics itself. As cryonics gets better and suspended animation [is actually used](http://www.cnet.com/news/suspended-animation-trials-to-begin-on-humans/) the idea of being cryonically preserved will seem more plausible to the general public.


There's 7 billion people on earth and only 270 cryonically preserved people. Therefore there is a huge growth potential in cryonics. ",8,13,False,default,,,,,

These machines could be robot type, small devices, or full on spaceships. You would be able to move between devices or possibly be in quite a few things at once, all interconnected or maybe not. Now that time is not a problem we can truck around the galaxy and check this shit out.

Not sure though what we would do with the human bodies though as we would basically be creating replicas. You wouldn't want to upload your brain stuffs when you are too old however as your brain may not be as ""quick""?? Perhaps the ""new gears"" would make old brains work like new? Dunno? Still a problem with the actual human parts though, I'm sure they wouldn't be happy to be ""stranded"". This assumes that consciousness isn't a thing which I don't think it is anyhow.  Perhaps they can get fat and lead ultra cushy lifes, write poetry or binge watch CSI Pluto. Like Wall-E.

Moving on, the new version of us 2.0 ""Homo-Machina??"" Can take their time exploring planets and grabbing resources to feed our enormous 3-D printers as we go. When we find pretty decent planets, we can farm an old school human colony with all the seeds and eggs we brought along, help them build some sweet obelisks, henges, and pyramids just for shits and grins and to make them curious and question their reality, then bug out and find a new planet. Check back later to see how they are doing or film some new reality shows. Maybe leave some solar cameras laying around.

""But OP how do we into light-speed?""

So if light is just energy eventually we figure out how to go ""container less"" perhaps... ""Homo-Sentient??"". Then we just shoot ourselves in a beam of light to where ever. This is how we get to OTHER galaxies like Andromeda which is freakin 2.5 million light years away. Were playing the long game here. The problem I have with this is how do we get sensory input and move around or build without any input/output devices at our disposal? Perhaps around this time, once we get to our destination we will be able to somehow manipulate individual particles themselves and make something out of nothing? Or locate a host that can build us a useful shell of some kind?

Anyhow I had a dream about all this crap last night, seems fairly plausible, I'm not a scientist, futurist, college (or high school), graduate. So yea ah cut me some slack.

Look at Greece, Spain, and Italy where the unemployment neared this level and resulted in many riots. It didn't reach critical levels, mostly because there is still hope and possibility for economic and job recovery.

A 30% unemployment rate caused by technology will be different because the unemployed know they have almost no opportunity and many of those who still have jobs will probably be aware that their job will be next.

My prediction is around 2025 because I think at this point the following tech will have destroyed a lot of these jobs:

* Self driving cars will be ubiquitous, especially where they replace paid drivers

* Self driving cars and drones will make quick delivery of goods within a few hours after purchase cheap and convenient. This will lead to a huge job loss in the retail and supermarket sector. With VR you could even have the virtual store experience and use a 3D scan of your body as an avatar for trying clothes. 

* Fast food will be almost completely automated, think burger bots and ordering plus payment going via computer. Restaurants will still have chefs, but waiters could be replaced by androids.

* General human level AI won't be there yet. But focused AI systems utilizing big data such as Watson will replace a ton of office work, call center staff, etc. 

* At this point everyone's full DNA will be available and big data will have found out what a lot of it means and what the disease indicators are. This coupled with constant tricorder like monitoring of everyone will revolutionize health care. Diseases will be treated before they become symptomatic. 

* There won't be a huge growth in programmers, CAD people, etc. as advanced software tools will make the whole process much more efficient and do a lot of work by automatically coding parts of the functional requirements of the user.

* And a plethora of more specialized jobs will be replaced in smaller fields not representing a significant impact on the whole number.

I've managed to get wins in each of the last three years.

This year, I wrote up entries [here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300404/planId/1309306) and [here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300901/planId/1309806) promoting basic income, using carbon fees as the revenue source. This would be very similar to James Hansen's ""fee-and-dividend"" proposal, with a fee per ton carbon and the money divided among the general population. But I think that by emphasizing the income side instead of the fee, we can motivate a much higher fee and accomplish two things at once.

Neither of those entries made it to finalist status. But there was one more [contest](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300701) that asked people to combine lots of other entries into one unified plan. So I put the basic income entries together with some of my other ideas, and now with [this entry](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/1300701/planId/1309401) I'm one of two finalists out of 43.

One winner will be chosen by popular vote (from anyone who registers on the site), and one by the judges (who could pick the popular-vote winner if they like). If I win I'll be making a presentation at an MIT [conference](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/conference2014) in November. In that case I'll make basic income a main point of the presentation, especially since it's one of the easiest parts to explain.",2,8,False,self,,,,,

In Europe, Russia, Japan, and South Korea, populations are shrinking by millions every year. In African countries population growth is slowing. And in the US people are having fewer children. A more temporary (20 year) concern will be the aging of the US population, as more people leave the workforce.

In the long view, I understand 100% technological unemployment. But in the next decade or so, it seems like there will be an ideal convergence between robotics/AI and population decline--depending on how they hit. A few scenarios:

**Tech dev faster than pop decline:** In this scenario automation accelerates faster than the population declines. This would be the kind of scenario that most people describe, in which people find themselves without work and some kind of UBI solution is required. 

**Tech dev equal to pop decline:** This would be ideal. People exit the workforce at about the rate that technology eliminates jobs. The delivery of technology meets the demand. The disruptive effects of automation are not as uncomfortable as predicted. We ease into a future with a small population and high automation.

**Tech dev slower than pop decline:** I think this is the most likely scenario. There will be a high demand for technology to replace a declining population, but the tech won't be able to develop fast enough. Immigration, training, and incentives will be necessary. Technological unemployment won't be a problem. Fewer people will put people in high demand. Rich nations will be competing for immigrants. Anyone who wants a job will be able to find one at high wages.

What do you think? How do you think technological unemployment and population decline will interact *in the next 10-15 years?*",6,15,False,self,,,,,

Imagine if all those cities could be used as power plants where roadways running perpendicular to the rivers, lakes, and oceans are built water channels instead. These channels can even be underground and under roadways where there is nothing else built under them at this moment, just roads on top taking up space. They can go very deep and narrow, and there may not need to be many. These channels have dams, possibly with a duel function of being a levee, in which turbines create a power source. These channels don't tare up any land in nature, only land where we already have thrown roads that run through the forest of skyscrapers that have replaced trees. Once the channels fill up level to the water source all we need to do is pump out enough water. Where is the energy to do that?

The energy is right there in the city, where people both need it and can produce it. Solar panels on each home and maybe eventually all the city infrastructure can provide day time energy. Both solar and wind by themselves are great but the source isn't consistent and the energy can't be stored, but actually the energy can be stored through mechanic work. The excess energy from solar panels work pumps that pump out the channels running through the city. Thus creating the condition for saved energy, in effect a battery, and any city next to a water source could be one. Urban infrastructure is right there so very little power loss takes place in traveling the energy, both to and from homes. Cities become power plants for rural areas and other cites not next to a water supply. These places could still use solar power to lessen the load. Whatever happened to that ""solar freakin roadway"" idea. Well maybe it can used to help too, although not nessesary that we mess with the government's public road systems. Why wait for government's energy policies to start getting intelligent. All it would take is getting the cities to invest in building dammed channels in them and then powering pumps that pump the water out during the day by nearby solar power sources which should produce enough excess for this, and then have saved energy for the night when the dams open. Local effort and investment is all that is needed.

Why would cities invest in it? These channels can be under the roadway or exposed and bridged over. Digging even a couple stories deep would actually provide real estate along the walls of the channels, if water is kept from getting too high. If water is keep from getting too low, shipping can take advantage of them and go further inland to avoid congesting cities, with much cargo transport. These channels can be really narrow so unloading shipping cargo can happen from both sides which is twice as fast unloading.

This is a system that uses the land we have already tore up, using only sun, water, and maybe air to produce and maintain our energy needs. No renewable resources required and cities, maybe even small towns, all around the world next to water supplies can do it.

Is this too far fetched? I just thought about it after reading an article linked here on reddit and the ideas from that thread. I'm excited for change. I want to be brought into the future not kept in the past. ",7,7,False,self,,,,,
