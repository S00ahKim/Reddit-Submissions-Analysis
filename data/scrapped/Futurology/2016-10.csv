2,2016-10-1,2016,10,1,9,55azej,The Future of Health Data Logging,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/55azej/the_future_of_health_data_logging/,abrownn,1475282342,"TLDR; A perfectly accurate image recognition system will finally be able to pick up the slack from people being too lazy to enter data or sync devices when paired with a more connected home and enable vastly superior health logging and healthcare service that we all care about in some capacity.

In the late 90's when the world wide web started proliferating, **calorie counting** became big again because people would no longer be forced to write down everything they ate and then tabulate their nutrition overview for the day/week; they could now enter a few simple values every day and websites would take care of it for them. So much easier, right? **Wrong!**Calorie counting with apps/websites has mostly been a fad, with wearables like the Fitbit seeing MASSIVE user attrition - **it's just too big of a hassle for people to take care of themselves.**

**Fast forward** to now and take a look at how advanced cameras and object recognition has become, even in the mainstream market. There are apps and services that can **analyze pictures of your food** and estimate caloric value (assuming there's nothing unidentifiable like a vinaigrette or sauce) and then track your stats for the day. Cool, right? **Wrong!** The algorithms for doing these things still aren't up to snuff and can give wrong values and are still **very much prone to error**, not to mention the additional user attrition of the services. If it can't get the right amount +- 1%, then your calorie count could be quite a bit off for the day, rendering the app **useless or detrimental.**

**Fast forward** again to the future, probably 15 - 20 years from now: With items like Amazon's Alexa growing in popularity, more and more people are inviting 'smart' camera systems into their homes, willingly. In the future, perhaps Google, Apple, or Amazon will release a version of a **'smart home hub'** connected to multiple cameras and systems in your home and would be able to actively review any footage of food that was recorded and analyze the contents and **automatically add them** to an individual/family's ""Health Log App"" that would be included with the smart home hub. Even in 2016, image recognition has seemingly advanced extremely quickly thanks to all the data that people are feeding the complex systems that major companies have built (via Snapchat face mapping, Apple photo face detection, Google face detection, Facebook face detection, etc for example). In 20 years, image recognition will have advanced massively, perhaps to near perfection. **A perfectly accurate image recognition system will finally be able to pick up the slack from people being too lazy to enter data or sync devices when paired with a more connected home and enable vastly superior health logging and healthcare service that we all care about in some capacity.**

Futuristic health logging is a pretty popular topic, but no one ever talks about the fine details needed to advance to that point - they only talk about the idea in-general. They don't lay out the connected technologies that will make this all possible, they just like the *idea* of smart health logging. We have the engineering capabilities to wire a home with endless cameras, process the data, and then feed it back to the person somehow (via an app or web dashboard or tablet display on the smart home hub). **We just need to wait for the companies that are working image recognition to get image recognition to nearly 100% and for a company to decide to be the one to finally tackle smart health logging.**

Thanks for reading this and putting up with my poor choice of bolding, &gt;quotes in place of pullquotes would've looked weird since Reddit doesn't have blog-style formatting options. Anyways...

I'd love to hear thoughts on the maturation of image recognition or from anyone who is familiar/works in the field. Also, do you think the time estimate is realistic? I feel like I was overly conservative in my estimate based on the consumer-facing rate of advancement.",1,5

4,2016-10-1,2016,10,1,10,55b56x,Are the Japanese showing how the people of future would behave?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/55b56x/are_the_japanese_showing_how_the_people_of_future/,kulmthestatusquo,1475284916,"If the whole world were like Japan, we would already be traveling in the outer space by now.

Mankind should strive for more, bigger and better, and globalism, new world order, etc are the only ways to do that since that means harnessing the world's energy into one point, rather than engage in destructive and self-defeating internecine wars.

The Japanese appear to be showing the signs of the ideal people of the future.

Japan used to have its own share of dissidents and rebels, but by 1970s they were pushed to the margins of society. 

Japan is one of the few advanced countries which still has officially recognized pariahs (the Burakumin), and those who act 'out of the line' are treated like pariahs and are excluded from all social functions.

In addition, those who cannot maintain themselves are also allowed to fall off from the tracks - out of sight, out of mind. As a result Japan is very cold against charity - the attitude is that it was the person's fault.

In addition, Japanese culture is very , very individualistic and those who 'stick out' are punished.

As a result, those who can't get a decent job , or those who simply 'gave up', are stuck in their rooms, mostly playing online games, and stop being relevant.

In Japan, politicians and other plum positions are usually inherited - a relic from its long feudal era, which only ended on 1868 (and many of the new elites came from what we would call as 'knight' class, not lords but still people who could bear arms and lord over the peasants).

As a result, those who were not born in an elite family, or those who were at least not smart enough to enter the better universities, just tend to give up. 

Like most resource-poor societies, all resources are concentrated to those near the top. Elites live like just any other elites in the Western World, and those in good career track can afford to live affluently. However for the rest, there are not too much.

Younger people lose interest on relationship or even sex, let alone reproduction. They hardly care about politics, society, etc at all; the smarter ones have already left to play in the greener pasture, and the rest just live their lives out, doing not much.

Since most politicians get their positions from their parents, there are only fights among themselves; none of them will 'rock the vote'. People who used to do that are all dead, and now it is whose son beats whose daughter, that's it.

The yakuza and the underworld are violent but they know their is a 'firm line' they better not cross, so whatever happens there stays there, although if someone falls from the tracks they are fair game to these folks.

Like a giant centrifugal machine, Japan has separated its 'valuable' people from the rest, who will live their lives quietly, not reproducing and by staying at their room or working in menial jobs spending very little resources.

Plus the Japanese hate immigration so only very few people get to emigrate to there, usually whites who married a Japanese. (Japan accepts a few people of color, like the athlete in the last olympics with a Jamaican father and a Japanese mother, if they are 'judged to be beneficial'.)

Such static, changeless, progressless but at the same time technologically advancing and economically advanced, society is the model for future, which rewards those who are valuable, and will have enough for the rest to live on, as long as they 'walk in the line' and do not stray from the 'path' (and those who do not will be taken care by the yakuza or something like that).",50,0

I also claim for the prospects of humanity it would be advantageous is we switched to this way of rule sooner rather than later. 

I do concede that Data Set Bias is a problem and would have to be negated in some way. Really though I don't think an AI would have that much trouble valuing humans inherently as equal and giving special care to those who are actively working to further human prosperity. 

I would like to hear some of the fears that people have and why you may be fearful of AI Overlords. ",64,3

It is now 2016 and we still don't have any flying cars.


However, we are seeing a lot of articles hyping up autonomous vehicles by 2020s and how most people will be driving in one by 2040s or so. Many of these predictions about self driving cars remind me of the flying car hype that people thought we would have by now. I am somewhat skeptical about self driving cars mainly because of a lot of people really like to drive. Another is that there is a lot of liability issues surrounding SDVs. All these concerns make me worry that we won't be getting self driving cars any time soon.

All I recall was that the lecture opened with an insight into how bad analysts typically are at forecasting the future. And an example was made of the report that AT&amp;T hired McKinsey to work on that led the firm to suggest a ceiling of 900,000 cellular phone users only.

[Here's an Arvix paper on PNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04671).

&gt; Learning to solve complex sequences of tasks--while both leveraging transfer and avoiding catastrophic forgetting--remains a key obstacle to achieving human-level intelligence. The progressive networks approach represents a step forward in this direction: they are immune to forgetting and can leverage prior knowledge via lateral connections to previously learned features. We evaluate this architecture extensively on a wide variety of reinforcement learning tasks (Atari and 3D maze games), and show that it outperforms common baselines based on pretraining and finetuning. Using a novel sensitivity measure, we demonstrate that transfer occurs at both low-level sensory and high-level control layers of the learned policy.

 
[And here's a blog post on deep RL](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/).

&gt; This is a long overdue blog post on Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is hot! You may have noticed that computers can now automatically learn to play ATARI games (from raw game pixels!), they are beating world champions at Go, simulated quadrupeds are learning to run and leap, and robots are learning how to perform complex manipulation tasksthat defy explicit programming. It turns out that all of these advances fall under the umbrella of RL research. I also became interested in RL myself over the last ~year: I worked through Richard Suttons book, read through David Silvers course, watched John Schulmanns lectures, wrote an RL library in Javascript, over the summer interned at DeepMind working in the DeepRL group, and most recently pitched in a little with the design/development of OpenAI Gym, a new RL benchmarking toolkit. So Ive certainly been on this funwagon for at least a year but until now I havent gotten around to writing up a short post on why RL is a big deal, what its about, how it all developed and where it might be going.

It seems a bit shocking that we've had all this progress, and yet we still haven't gotten around to crossing these two methods. Deep reinforcement learning is a very, very important step towards the development of artificial general intelligence, but none of it matters if the AI can master Pong but completely fail at Pac-Man, despite both games being on the Atari 2600 and utilizing some similar skills. 
 
Imagine you learned how to bake a cake. After 50 tries, you finally bake a perfect cake, better than any other person can in fact. Wonderful, right? But when you go to bake brownies, you have to learn everything from scratch. You need 50 more shots just to relearn how to bake these things, despite the fact there isn't much difference between a cake and brownies in terms of preparation. 
That's where AI is now. We can teach AI how to bake cakes, and we can teach AI how to bake brownies but we can't teach AI how to bake cakes and then brownies. Which is a pretty massive handicap for intelligence, to say the least. One of the most fundamental aspects of what defines something as being 'intelligent' is the ability to use past experiences to predict the future. When I say 'predict', I'm not necessarily saying anything ridiculously abstract like going into the stock market or figuring out higher level physics from simple experiments. No, I mean ""figure this out based on what you've learned from something else."" 
Like my previous analogy said, if you can bake a cake, you can bake brownies. If you can't, then there's something fundamentally wrong with your brain. You shouldn't have to relearn how to measure ingredients when you're making a new, but similar dish. 
 
So in that sense, we've figured out one aspect of machine learning, but it's still useless without the ability to reason or experience memory feedback. PNNs are a step in that direction.",9,26

How viable an option for providing large volumes of power are orbital solar arrays that collect, store and beam energy down to Earth? Is the technology for this here already, in its infancy, or merely conceptual/pipe dreams? Could an energy storage option contained on such an array allow us to smooth out high demand periods with as-needed availability?

This is prompted by the discussion that stemmed from the post about modular nuclear reactors, wherein people raised the point about solar that some areas simply don't have a high enough level of insolation for solar to be a viable industrial energy source.

I also ask because as Blue Origin have announced their New Glen launcher, and SpaceX have discussed the Falcon Heavy and IST launch system in recent days it seems like payload capacity for such a project is finally just around the corner. 

This isn't about cost or political will power (though I'd be interested to hear any cost estimates), merely if we CAN do this today or in the near future.",27,4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywF6ZzsghI

Around 42:00, he said these numbers are conditioned on no global collapse occurring.

He was talking about the % of reaching a superintelligece. He was saying these words before Ray Kurzweil himself, plus a bunch of google employees.

Although the audience laughs, since they 'know' the odds of that is too small for them to care, you never know. After all, Brexit, a destabilizing event, did take place despite of all the pundits on the world saying otherwise.

Although I think history will follow its course on the first week of November, and the tech progress will continue unhindered without the possibility of a disruption, 

to continue the tech advances we cannot tolerate any changes, destabilization, etc.

In other words, the disenfranchised of the world will stay that way, the winners of the world will stay that way, no changes in world's power structure, Russia and NK will have regime changes so they won't mess up things, and China will follow along even though it will not like that.

All the resources will be concentrated in America's more prosperous regions at the expense of others, without impunity. Those who might not agree will find themselves replaying Gaddafi's video.

It might be cruel for those not 'in', but it is the reality and it is the only way to continue the tech advances. Sorry.

We have to take a utilitarian mindset - it is more important to reach the next level of civilization, and expand human horizons by conquering the space, than make a few billion people in the world have one more morsel of meat.

The reason is very simple.

As the tech advances, it becomes more expensive, more resource-intensive and more grandiose, we need all the money and resource in the world to go further.

The easy pickings having exhausted, we have to rely on space resources to go further - Elon Musk's half-hearted attempts will still cost billions.

So, sorry for those not 'in'. No changes, no disruptions, no 'reset'. Since these will harm the advance to Singularity (which is just a limited goal since whatever comes out from it will still be stuck on earth), and eventually the stars.

I simply do not see a way otherwise. Today's course is the only course which will probably ensure we reach the next level of civilization, and a disruption, to put it mildly, will significantly disrupt the schedule.",5,1

Let's make a list of all known professions that have so far been replaced by robots. Using news sources or personal experience, let's use our collective intelligence to create a long list......Are you ready?
I have a few to start out with: (I'm including both robots and AI)

1. Ross, an AI lawyer is hired by real law firms, 2016
2. Pepper the robot is used as a babysitter for Japanese children
3. Students at a University didn't know their online teaching assistant was AI
4. The top GO player was beat by AI
5. Robot receptionist is hired by a Belgian hospital.

*Over the next 10-30 years...*

- 7 billion humans will wake up in the morning and take individual packets of Vitamin C, Magnesium and other nutrients. Someone will need to manufacture, market and distribute 14-21 billion packets of vitamins per day. There are some jobs there. 

- Rooftop organic gardening will become popular, as gardening becomes decentralized, and we go back to our agrarian roots. Clueless urbanites (like me) will need to re-learn farming in classes, and with rooftop gardening experts. 

- Coding. There's a STEM worker shortage which won't let up any time soon. Absolute beginners courses on technology will become a billion dollar industry. As the next 2,3 billion come online, they'll want to learn typing, Youtube, and social media. The average tech-literate computer user will become a sought-after technologist.

- 7 billion people will need clean water filtration, from charcoal-sand filters, to atmospheric water generators. There's another industry. 

- We'll build livable, organic, modular cities in the desert, mountains, and maybe underwater. If workers are treated well, there's another industry.

- 7 billion people will need to learn home-energy generation, with pico-wind turbines and portable solar. The average American home needs kilowatts of power. Most developing world homes only need a trickle charge for a cellphone and a light.

- Solar dehydration. Half of food grown on Earth spoils before it reaches the plate. Big refrigeration is expensive and impractical. Large scale solar dehydration will create jobs, save food, and improve social stability.

- Decentralized banking will employ millions of people, as money moves from too big to fail institutions, into localized co-ops.

- Crowdfunding. Crowdfinance is the most efficient way of funding an economy. The localized and specialized crowdfunding industry may create millions of jobs. 

- Organic living. From Hobbit homes, to plastic bottle houses, and inflatable pubs, new living ideas are being explored right now. 

- Language learning, education, fitness. As less money is wasted on insurance, pharmaceuticals and banking, money will flow to education and fitness.

People are building this timeline. All these initiatives are up and running now.  No one knows exactly what will happen in the future, but change comes from the micro, and spreads out to the macro-scale. 
 
 Right now there are people eating healthy food, working out every day, drinking clean water and working in an industry they like. There are others eating junk food, doing no exercise, drinking Kool Aid and working in a job they hate. So everyone gets a choice of timeline. We have the option to try and create as much new employment jobs as possible.  
 
  If robots take all our jobs and we end up in a Bladerunner future, it's our own stupid fault.

The part that I found particularly exciting:  
  
  
""**Upcoming Mars Oppositions  and what SpaceX is planning for each:**  


July, 2018: Send a Dragon spacecraft (the Falcon 9s SUV-size spacecraft) to Mars with cargo


October, 2020: Send multiple Dragons with more cargo


December, 2022: Maiden BFS voyage to Mars. Carrying only cargo. This is the spaceship Elon wants to call Heart of Gold.


January, 2025: First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.


Lets all go back and read that last line again.


January, 2025: First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.


Did you catch that?


If things go to plan, the Neil Armstrong of Mars will touch down about eight years from now.


And zero people are talking about it.


But they will be. The hype will start a couple years from now when the Dragons make their Mars trips, and itll kick into high gear in 2022 when the Big Fucking Spaceship finally launches and heads to Mars and lands there. Everyone will be talking about this.


And the buzz will just accelerate from there as the first group of BFS astronauts are announced and become household names, admired for their bravery, because everyone will know theres a reasonable chance something goes wrong and they dont make it back alive. Then, in 2024 theyll take off on a three-month trip thatll be front-page news every day. When they land, everyone on Earth will be watching. Itll be 1969 all over again.


This is a thing thats happening.


Elon doesnt like when people ask him about this first voyage and the Neil Armstrong of Mars. He says that its not about humanity putting a new multi-planetary feather in its cap, and hes quick to point out, putting people on the moon was super excitingbut wheres our moon base? In other words, having humanity give Mars a high five for bragging rights is not what matterswhat matters is carrying out the full vision of actually creating a full, self-sustaining civilization on Mars.


And yeah, sure, fine. But Im excited for 2025. Its gonna be so fun.


Anyway, so then the next Mars opposition will roll around in 2027. This time, if everything stays on track, multiple BFSs will make the trek to Mars, carrying more people than were in the original group in 2025. And the spaceship that went over in 2025the space Mayflowerwill make its return trip to Earth, carrying some of the first group of Mars pioneers back home. Theyll return to massive celebration as international heroes, and the legendary spaceship will head off to enjoy its life in the Air and Space Museum.


Meanwhile, well all be glued to the TV as the group of BFSs arrive on Mars, where the people in them will continue the grueling work started by the 2025 group. The early colonists will have a hard job like early colonists always doand this will be extra hard. Not only will they have to truly start from scratchdigging mines and quarries and refineries, constructing the first underground village habitat with the first Martian hospitals and schools and greenhouse farms, laying down a giant plumbing system to pump water into the village, building that first rocket propellant plantbut theyll have to do all of this in a place where they cant go outside without a spacesuit on, and where everyone and everything theyve ever known is on a pale blue dot in the night sky.


Itll be hard, but for the explorers of our world the payoff may be worth it. Elon says: You can go anywhere on Earth in 24 hours. Theres no physical frontier on Earth anymore. Now, space is that frontier, so itll appeal to anyone with that exploratory spirit.


In April of 2029, SpaceX will send an even larger group of spacecraft, people, and cargo to Mars. This time, itll probably get less attention. By 2029, well probably be getting used to the idea that there are people on Mars and that every 26 months, a great two-way migration occurs.


The growing Mars colony will continue to entice the adventurersthose who read about the great sailing exhibitions of the 15th and 16th centuries and yearn to be there. When I asked Elon about how the small colony will grow and evolve, he said: Think of the Mars colony as an organism that starts off as a zygote, and then becomes multi-cellular, and then gets organ differentiationso it doesnt look exactly the same all the way along, any more than the first settlement in Jamestown wasnt representative of the United States today. Itll be the same with MarsMars will be the new New World.


The 2031 and 2033 and 2035 oppositions will bring substantially more people to the new New World. By this point, the budding Martian city will be a part of our lives. Well follow the Twitter feeds of some of our favorite journalists on Mars to keep up with whats happening there. Well all get hooked on Marss first hit reality shows. And some of us will start thinking, Should I sign up to go to Mars one of these years before I get too old?


By 2050, there will be over a hundred thousand people on Mars. The company your son works for might have a branch there, and hell be saying goodbye to a couple co-workers who are about to head to the planet for a 52-month stint. He tells you that he doesnt want to go because he doesnt want to take his ninth-grade daughter away from her life and her friends. But he says shes applying to a program that would bring her to Mars from the ages of 17 to 23 for an urban planning degree. You worry, even though you know its irrational. Its just that you remember the days when going to Mars was risky and dangerous, and some part of you is still uncomfortable with it. And what if she decides not to come back?


By 2065, the early days of Mars seem primitive. During the first few Mars migrations, only a few spaceships made the trip with only 100 people in each, it was prohibitively expensive to go, it took three months to get there, and there were only a few very grueling industries on Mars to work in.


In 2065, every Mars opposition sees over 1,000 ships make the trip, each carrying over 500 people and a couple thousand tons of cargo. Half a million people make the journey every two years, and about 50,000 less than that come back, because Earth-to-Mars migration capacity grows a little bit each time as more ships are built. The trip, which now takes only 30 days, costs only $60,000 (in 2016 dollars)and most people just pay off the ticket price with their well-paying job on Mars (labor is in high demand as the early Mars cities continue to expand and new cities are built).

Many people remember those early days of the Mars colony when it was all about SpaceXfunded by SpaceX or their cargo clients and driven by their ambition and their ingenuity and their guts. But now, dozens of companies specialize in Earth-Mars transit and hundreds of companies focus on development and entrepreneurship on Mars. And transit is paid for like planes and trains and buses are paid for todayby passengers buying tickets.  
  
  
A decade later, the 2074 migration brings the Mars population above a million people. Small celebrations break out around both worlds, as a long-awaited landmark is achieved. Most people though, dont even notice.""",24,33

Don't downvote me yet! I promise this isn't as stupid as it sounds.

So, the founding fathers were absolutely brilliant men. Not only were they some of the greatest political philosophers in human history, they were fantastic military strategists, philosophers, scientists, historians, architects, businessmen, inventors, writers, linguists, and so much more. My favorite ""the founding fathers are great"" anecdote is about the Jefferson cup. Thomas Jefferson did a bunch of incredible stuff in his life that affects us all today - the constitution is the most notable example. But he was also always working on other stuff including creating a design for a cup that is still widely used today.

The point that I'm making is that the founding fathers were truly renaissance men. So I was wondering why they were so accomplished and a few things jumped out at me. First of all, they were incredibly intelligent - no one can deny that. But it's worth pointing out that they were all very wealthy people who had slaves to do work for them. They spent their time in leisure, thinking, working, inventing, writing, and so on.

When we have AI to do work for us, we will all be able to spend more time to explore our passions and create interesting things. Perhaps we will all be lesser Thomas Jeffersons.

To me, the threat of humans controlling these machines is far more concerning, as it seems more realistic and imminent.  Militaries are becoming increasingly automated, and some completely automated weapons systems already exist (a lot of them exist depending on your definition of automated).  


The ""AI taking over"" scenario seems to be much more theoretical and would involve programming a level of ingenuity into AI that seems impossible at this point.  By the time we get to the point an AI is able to take over an army of ""robots"", it seems that we would already have had all of the technology for a single human to control that army of ""robots"" for awhile.  By programming directives/setting parameters on what the ""robots"" could and could not do, it seems a small number of people could control a large group of ""robots"".  I guess this could also feed into the ""AI taking over"" scenario, that we would be controlling these armies and then the AI would be advanced enough to take the control from us.


I realize this involves a lot of speculation, and is a very loose interpretation of the concerns voiced by the previously mentioned scientists/execs combined with the popular belief that a ""Skynet"" type of scenario would be how an AI invasion would occur.  As the idea of these AI controlled armies is ambiguous, I am using the term ""robot"" very loosely as it could be any sort of automated weapons systems that could be controlled individually or as a cohesive unit.

I'm not looking for help with writing, just finding compelling information that is presentable.

I was reading the OECD's recent publication on automation ( DOI: 10.1787/1815199x) ""The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries"" and at the current time, roughly 10% of jobs are automatable. That number seemed comfortingly low compared to what I had expected. I still haven't found a satisfying answer to the question as to plan for providing for displaced humans in the future.

Do you guys have any other credible future-looking resources on this topic, most of what I have found so far is either current or so far out in left field that it is not worth reporting on.

Like most things, wouldn't food be much more efficiently produced in a factory? I can't imagine people will be doing anything resembling farming in even a century. 

I hear about prices like $18,000 for a meatball or $330,000 for a burger, but these prices would clearly be reduced massively if lab grown meat was produced at the same scale as, say, livestock meat. 

Also, even though crops like wheat don't take as much energy to produce as a steak, they'll ultimately be produced in some kind of factory. Crops seem like they'd be a lot easier to make cheaply than meat, but there aren't many companies in the arena.

A few questions. 1) At what point does the lab say they've reduced the price enough that it's time to take advantage of economies of scale? 2) Is nature really so efficient at producing plants that we can't convert sunlight to calories more efficiently? 3) What's the industry consensus on when lab grown food is cheaper to produce than farming, similar to solar overtaking fossil fuels in recent years?",2,14

I want your opinions on the most effective ways to throw money at this.  Would it be effective to buy Internet ads to try and change people's opinion? Large corporations have money to lobby the government, why not hire our own lobbyists and convince congress to take this more seriously?  What about investing in private solar companies to try to increase competition and drive the price of solar down?  

We naturally are very short sighted.  The next 10 years might be the deciding factor in this whole thing. And 10 years is a long time to ha e people focus their attention on one thing.

I think about all that there is to learn a all the beauty in the universe that we have yet to see...

However, it has to be maintained, for one single reason - all the new tech research has to be financed. 

Without the huge financial institutions and other existing structures, these massive projects are not possible.

Just developing them is not enough - they have to be implemented, and developing the facilities for them are not cheap.

Otherwise civilization cannot advance and we cannot reach the next stage.

Most people are not aware of the massive needs for future projects since they do not directly benefit from them. 

Some people think 3-D printing will end scarcities but those who know what they are saying say otherwise.

https://hbr.org/2015/06/the-limits-of-3d-printing

tl, dr: 3d printing is more expensive than you think and has no economies of scale

It is more suited to the middle-age artisan economy, where we are heading to. Artisans served the few consumers, like kings, cardinals or lords. Not the general people who did not matter, and in turn they were treated a little bit better than the people and had secure positions, and remained somewhat influential till machines eliminated their reason to exist.

Plus, 3-D printers which can 'print' actually usable stuff are not going to be cheap. It won't print any of the high-tech gadgets from home - such precision stuff will remain in the hands of those who can afford the beasts.

We do need huge capital to reach the next level of civilization. Singularity University (Kurzweill, Diamandis, etc) boasts a trillion-dollar network, which is not explained - presumably that means it could raise a trillion dollars if necessary.

Demis Hassabis, the person who developed DeepMind, attended the Bilderberg meetings. That's the scale of money needed to continue the massive future advances. 

We are quite close to reaching the next step, but there are still a few kinks to smooth out. If we really want to see all the wondrous advances promised for the future, we have to tolerate the mega-institutions who will finance these projects and the giants who will profit from them.

We can't reach the future with George Bailey-style country banks. We need these megabanks, however they are rotten, and have to tolerate the big institutions being bailed out, negative interests, and the stiffing out of small depositors who do not really matter in today's world since their money are too tiny for the big institutions to matter, for - the sake of future and civilization.",25,6

Since this is likely not an open access paper, I'll paste the abstract here:

&gt;Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the worlds oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints.

I post this here as a response to the frequently-held notion that in the future everyone will live forever, or at least many centuries. That's probably not true.",8,2

Intelligence are in some common ways with targetted AI or the one we dream with,  but difinettly there are a non common space.
First, we can describe intelligence with the most optimum way known to identity a problem and analyse it, and built the optimum solution that according to our knowledge to solve it.
Phelossiphically there should be always a better solution more better than what the most intelligent human found,
Always, 
But maybe we will not discover it except we met another intelligent civilization that is much more intelligent than ours, we call the aliens.
Not only, but also intelligence is how we create a magnefissent ideas such as theories, innovations, tools etc.

If you agree with the previous then analyse it with me.

OK but before you can agree again that we goto same good point of AI,
Software can analyse and solve a lot of problems,  sometimes identity it with several techniques some of those techniques considered as an AI and some wrongly not considered.

Neoral network considered as an ai, while 
Data analysis not, but it's some kind of an ai.

Before computers human use another humen to assist him in data analysis the same way that computers do,
Usually the second part was mathimatition which we considers them as the ones of the most intelligent peoples.

Ok than way not we considered analytical data tools/software intelligent even, not only but, the results in second case always much more accurate and faster.

Oops, if we going to this part of intelligence ""only"" of intelligence then computers win lol.
Computers are much intelligent or at least successful in this part.

The other parts are on it's way of successful progress, specially in the quantum computers era, and of course in the era after, and after, and after.

I imagine some day we will surprised that the super ideas comes from computes which defeat human mind.
Yeah the super intelligent civilization may not come from space but from beside you in earth, yeah you have to proud that you create such super intelligence but you may be also shy if this minds decide to put you in a slaves camp lol.

This AI may also used to progress the AI itself by non Imaginable ways.

Be sure also, that a questions which had no answers for thousands years may be answered by AI
Does God exists? 
Does there is a life after death!?
But I bid they found the answer just for challenge, coz they don't care or interested with humen distiny .

They will get a longer life than human of course by nature and maybe they will seak someway for eternity.

If they find a new way to use humen in there targets, whatever these targets will be, then they will keep them as a kind, like we now keep another animals kinds other wise.
No they will not destroy man kind no need unless mankind be dengeroues on them and of course it will not, or be a hedich or use a lot of resources needed.
 
And I think they will find someway to keep mankind alive for some reasons like historical musimes and open man-zoo or a modern theories like environmental equilibrium lol.

I've been procrastinating a lot on the internet recently now that Uni term has restarted again and I've seen a lot of posts on how we have to act NOW on climate change, and a rather small number of them specifically detail ways we can do it with the technology we have or the potential future technologies we may have available to us. I know that on this subreddit I am not the most qualified of people (final year chemical engineering student), but I'm going to have a go at outlining a few things, my apologies in advance if you think I'm talking rubbish, but let me know please, it'll help me with my studies anyway to think and talk about this stuff.

CO2 levels are still rising hugely and this needs to come to a stop very very soon as every article on climate change tells us. It's worth pointing out that right now, very few countries can afford to just shut down all CO2 emitting plants overnight, both financially and in terms of their energy infrastructure. We do not have the resources as a society to make instantaneous overnight changes like that. I believe that, whilst there should not be any coal fired power stations open in several decades time, (and that is achievable even with a continuation of our shambolic attempts at curbing climate change), the damage is (and will continue to be) already done.

In the meantime, we need a way of storing the CO2 that is released from these stations. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) would be a very good intermediate method of doing this. CCS takes the exhaust gas and either pumps it deep into the ocean, which absorbs it, or pumps it into the oil fields it came out of, keeping them as carbon sinks. Another thing worth doing would be to reduce the amount of CO2 per unit power produced, with the relatively simple switch from coal to natural gas. This is happening in some developed countries already. Natural gas produces half the CO2 that Coal power does per unit of electricity, and fills the same role in a national grid.

National grids and energy supply/demand are another thing that seem to be overlooked in most things I have read on climate change. The beauty of fossil fuel power stations is how quick they are to switch on and off, so they are able to deal with a surge in power required almost instantaneously. With the exception of specially designed hydro dams, which have water pumped in when there is excess power, and pump it out to produce electricity when there is a shortage, no clean renewable energy sources can do this as effectively as fossil fuels currently.

The two main things you need in an electricity grid are a baseload and something to deal with shortages. Right now - ignoring climate change and renewables for a horrible moment, this is nuclear as a baseload and fossil fuels as the 'quick fix'. The main issue with current renewables is not cost any more, it is reliability and an inability to fill either key role in a grid. Hydro power and tidal power are the only renewable sources that can almost 100% guarantee a baseload power output, and these two do have local environmental impacts regardless. Solar power cannot provide electricity at night for example, and wind power is reliant on it actually being windy. The normal thing to point out in response to this is ""industrial scale 'batteries' are becoming much cheaper now so they can indirectly fill these roles"". Whilst this is true, this would only feasibly be a short term solution on a day to day basis. Using wind power as the example, if you have an unusually still (in terms of windspeeds) week, you are out of electricity if over reliant on wind power. This cannot happen for industry and people in general. The same for solar, due to shorter, colder days in winter, people use more electricity. Solar power also produces less electricity in winter and therefore there will either be a huge excess in summer or a shortage in winter when over reliant on solar.

In an ideal world, therefore, one might say that your baseload power is hydro/tidal and your surplus power is solar and wind connected to batteries, however, very few countries in the world have sufficient coastline for enough tidal power or sufficiently adequate valleys for hydro dams, and conversely some countries have much less sunlight than others or less winds etc. and therefore, not every country can do this approach either.

This is where nuclear power comes in as quite a useful intermediate (by intermediate, I mean something to buy us time until better sustainable and renewable technology comes along e.g. nuclear fusion). The risks of nuclear waste are often overstated by the media, for example - [some studies say that you are more likely to develop a tumour from radiation near a coal power station than a nuclear one](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/). Additionally, [nuclear has made an immense difference to how much greenhouse gases are emitted](http://climate.nasa.gov/news/903/coal-and-gas-are-far-more-harmful-than-nuclear-power/). Also the nuclear waste is solid rather than gaseous and therefore easier to treat and store. I am not going to pretend that nuclear doesn't have drawbacks, it does. But right now it is the cleanest globally reliable form of energy production that we have.

In future, other technologies that could come into effect are solar based but use 'fossil fuels' as long term storage - [these technologies](http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/chemistry/photosynthetic-solar-cell-04070.html) (they produce syngas which can in turn be turn into biodiesel) basically utilise photosynthesis and are therefore carbon neutral.

Carbon neutrality globally, even from this moment onwards is still not sufficient to stop temperatures rising globally, we need to create more carbon sinks in the long term. The commonly suggested example for this is reforestation, but with an expanding global population to feed I believe we simply don't have sufficient space to totally reforest all the trees that have been cut down, discounting faster growing future crops. Another interesting option, again using Syngas from the solar cells above, is to use this syngas to produce the polymers we use in day to day life rather than extracting more from crude oil and natural gas. These polymers, if this was adapted globally, would act as a very useful carbon sink and would start to cut CO2 levels. There is no point in looking at this deeply until we start cutting CO2 emissions more.

In an ideal future world for me I believe the baseload should be Nuclear Fission (to be replaced by Nuclear Fusion if/when we develop it) and a surplus power from solar derived syngas, supplemented by all the currently developed renewable sources if/where appropriate, with a polymer carbon sink using these solar syngas cells.

Tl;dr we aren't screwed yet, but we need to start moving towards clean energy as soon as possible. But anybody who's ever read a climate change article knows that. I believe that 'intermediate' alternatives such as natural gas with Carbon Capture technology and Nuclear Fission should be used in the meantime to buy as time for the necessary funding and infrastructure for a greener, cleaner future.

Congratulations to anybody who read all of that, I admire your stamina! Let me know what you guys think please!

Why not phase them out for decentralized living? 

Cities like Detroit are completely uneconomical to rebuild with the needed infrastructure. They are from a time before manufacturing was really automated as in you need a worker to screw in a handful of bolts, another worker screws in other bolts or wrenches nuts for the bolts. What took 25 guys to put in bolts can be done with a robot and one or two technicians. 

You aren't going to get those jobs back so the cities won't be able to return to it's original population size. If nobody is going to have a job, then why do we need cities like NYC where it costs a half million dollars for an apartment, when 50 miles out into the country side you can purchase  a house for 50 to 100,000 dollars?

With self driving cars that are charged with solar/wind it would  be alright to commute for 2 hours early in the morning as you can take a nap while the car drives itself.",8,3

Monogamy will be either enforced, or we will be reprogrammed to be strictly monogamous and loyal (like swans?). Something about rapidly changing trends will also change, imo (like fashion, subcultures). 

Such way of life leads to rapid desaturation if certain fields. e.g.: modern sexual deviancy and promiscuoty is caused by heavy consumption of pornography. People stated choosing amount of partners they are having over quality of marriage and family.

Same could be said about entertainement industry: attention spans are shortening, so we are seeing genres like vines trending fast, because they are short. Modern movies and videogames are getting pumped out in huge amounts, but often get average and sub-average reviews (Mfia 3, Ghostbusters). 

Let alone your average Chads ""muh dick muh pussy"" way of life

What I want to say, that today we choose quantity over quality, and such principle will not work in society where people will be biologically immortal, because instant gratification desaturates certain aspects of life.

It seriously feels like we can only play in a **category for disabled players**, as there are different tournaments specific for chess engines where we can't qualify. We are on the verge of not even being able to *understand* why they play their moves. End game strategies are already beyond human comprehension. 

As AI advances, I can see machines becoming better than humans in almost all intellectually challenging games and hobbies, online video games, and also all sports.

There is also the issue of ""cheating"" using machine help. Like a disabled athlete that would actually not be disabled or fake the exact category of disability.

First of all, the egg donors are screened with psychological tests. You can also search them based on physical characteristics, you can see photos of them as a child and as an adult, see their education levels, etc. Also, they can be classified into categories in terms of new egg donors( Standard / Premium / Elite) where elite is ""Proven/repeat &amp; Exceptional (high-achieving and/or high demand donors that have resulted in a pregnancy)"".

I know one woman who couldn't use her own eggs so she became pregnant with someone else's sperm / eggs, basically 100% selecting her baby via searches.

Is this the future of evolution for the human species? Finding the fittest human beings by searching an indexed database? If this becomes more popular will genetic diversity suffer? Do these companies have a responsibility, esp. for sperm donation, to limit the donations in order to ensure genetic diversity?",1,1

Basically competition between economic entities stabilize in a more or less optimal solution due to evolutionary forces. The failures of centralized economic management to me is partly explained by the fact that decision making is so concentrated in a few individuals at the top (and those few are just as corrupt and self interested as any other human); and that those few human brains that made the decisions [Stalin, Mao etc.] simply could not perform the quadrillions of calculations and make minute real time adjustments that billions of competing minds can make. Furthermore even small changes in the brains of those at the top can multiply into catastrophic consequences when they are multiplied through the entire nation [Mao going hmm wouldn't it be great to have backyard furnaces to surpass USA steel production]. Basically I just feel that the ""invisible hand"" acts as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent truly inefficient utilization of resources from expanding out of control through negative feedback (e.g. going bankrupt etc).

A Superintelligent AI can overcome those limitations of centralized control though because it WOULD be capable of making those quadrillions of calculations necessary in real time and provide more optimized utilizations of resources.

Of course there are upsides and downsides of everything, these thoughts just came to me after watching the debates and seeing how incompetent individual humans can be.",24,15

He discussed CS experts predicting AGI sometime in the 2040s. He explained how ""the train doesn't stop at Humansville Station, it is likely to swoosh right by.  This comes down to the laws of physics.  A human brain fires at 200 Hz, tops, while for computers they already process information in the mega hertz range..... a human brain has to fit inside a cranium while a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger.""

I don't see this in it of itself as being a problem.  Technology has already been a double edged sword and you can do a lot of good or evil with that kind of power, so it's much more important to understand what will be done with that technology.  Nick Bostrom said how machines will need to learn to develop the morality of humanity in order for it to be safe for the human race, so this begs the question:  how moral are our leaders that will shape our future?

Conniving sociopaths was what I saw last night, not a dignified statesman and a dignified stateswoman.  Hillary has covered up Bill's sexual assaults against various women over many decades while Trump's transgressions could fill an entire book.  If you were to get the honest opinion of even people like Sean Hannity, Barack Obama, and Bernie Sanders, I feel they are at some level disgusted with who they HAVE to support for political reasons.  These are the politicians that we will have in the coming days of the singularity?  But I don't even think that's the worst of it.  Mankind has become remarkably kind and compassionate towards one another  very recently in comparison to hundreds of thousands of years of strife that we have had since our species conception.  However, that doesn't mean that our kindness has been extended to other living things.  We stick animals in factory farms, test on animals in ways that make the Nazi death camp experiments look like child's play, and destroy entire ecosystems.

Furthermore, we have a large level of indifference towards the many billions of other people in the world.  In the words of Louis CK:   ""My life is really evil.  There are people who are starving in the world, and I drive an Infiniti. Thats really evil. There are people who are like born and then they go, Oh, Im hungry, and then they just die, and thats all they ever got to do.  And, meanwhile, Im in my car  boom boom, brrr!  like having a great time, and I sleep like a baby. I could trade my Infiniti for like a really good car, like a nice Ford Focus and Id get back like twenty thousand dollars, and I could save hundreds of people from dying of starvation with that money.  And every day, I don't do it.""  So essentially, the machines could be controlled by a very small group of people who could already be immoral and as the saying goes ""power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely.""  However, at some point, the machines will be so smart that even they will not be able to control them.  

Humanity will try to have the machines emulate our values but it will backfire since a moral tenet of most human cultures is human life is superior to other forms of life - but that is often justified by the fact man has having social intelligence, common sense, wisdom, empathy, reasoning capabilities, etc. which come as a result of superior cognitive powers.

The machines will be able to cream us all, so they could model their behavior towards us in the same way that we behave towards non-human species.Which brings up the million dollar question, if the machines become vastly more superior to humanity and wipe us out, who are we to say that it is immoral?  They most likely have a reasoning capabilities that brought them to that conclusion based off of compelling logic.If we want humanity to survive, it is not enough that we have the machines emulate our behavior, we must change our behavior to act as a better model for the machines with the time that we have left before ASI hits.

We are talking within a few decades.  
  
Imagine a small implant, administered via a quick shot to the base of the skull, and your brain can suddenly interface with millions of neuro-nanobots.  Or perhaps it can happen via brain-radio interface without any physical injections at all.  
  
Point is, your brain represents one of the most sophisticated parallel-processing computers that the universe has ever created.  And to be honest, you don't always use it to its full capacity.  So would you be willing to donate 10% of your time and thought to a larger hive mind?  This could take the form of process offloading, where you find yourself wondering about specific mathematical concepts and trying to find patterns amidst a chaotic swirl of noise, or perhaps you would agree to do certain research on a topic as part of a 'rapid research team'.  
  
Point is, you essentially would not be in full control for say... 10% of the time.  But on the flip side, you would get first access to genius revelations far above and beyond what anyone else could see.  You would have a first row seat to the combined hive-thoughts of a million linked human brains, and would naturally have gigantic advantages in almost every mental endeavor over non-linked individuals.  
  
Such a system would have to be voluntary in order to be ethical, but would you want to participate?  How much of your autonomy would you be willing to sacrifice?  5%?  10%?  25%?  A higher number?

This Guardian article summarises it succinctly:

[Is our world a simulation? Why some scientists say it's more likely than not] (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/simulated-world-elon-musk-the-matrix)

In that article:

&gt; According to this weeks New Yorker profile of Y Combinator venture capitalist Sam Altman, there are two tech billionaires secretly engaging scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. 

But how do these tech billionaires expect to break out of a simulation?

This concept reminds me of the movie The 13th Floor. [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteenth_Floor)

In that movie, the person in the simulation managed to take over the body of a person who was connected to the simulation. But the interesting thing is that it is possible that he was in a simulation within a simulation.

In my mind, if we are actually beings living in a computer simulation, it would be basically impossible for us to break out of it, as we would be created by bits and bytes that would not be able to be translated out into the non-simulation external reality. For all intents and purposes, we would exist in a different dimension.

Im interested in your thoughts. Consider this discussion a thought experiment, and post your theories as to how we could, if we were in a simulation, break out?

I look forward to the future each day. I'm sure most everyone here would. However, the future comes one day at a time. The future is tomorrow, which for most isn't an exciting prospect. But tomorrow has to happen and the future will have to wait.

I've noticed a lot of ""whoa, let's slow down"" comments in /r/Futurology. It seems as though a lot of people doubting newer and more advanced technologies. I feel as though a lot of those posts are misinformed ideas of the technology or some are just fear mongering.

For example, there's a lot of push back against electronic voting due to the security and fraud concern of the technology. While it's true any system is vulnerable to manipulation, to hold back the progress of technology due to this silly.

Should we have not researched nuclear technologies because it can be used for war? Sure, the world would be safe from us destroying ourselves. But think about that for one second, how would you even describe what we have today to a person in even the late 1800s.

&gt;Alright, we have this 'nuclear thing' that makes heat to turn turbines. It uses steam power, similar to train engines. It's really like coal. Just a sack full of this nuclear 'coal' will produce two million times more heat than that sack of coal you're hold.

&gt; It's nearly as common as silver though, unlike your coal. Also, it's super dangerous. Someone put together less than a single train cart worth of the stuff and made it explode in Japan during a war. When it exploded, it created a fire that was impossible to put out. We did put it out by pouring thousands and thousands of tons of concert over top of the fire, just so it wouldn't burn through. However, we've banned it, at least as a weapon. We still use it for power, but we still use coal. You see, when nuclear burns you, you might not even feel it, or you might simply cease to exist. If you can't feel it, you'll die anyway, due to the health effects...

I think I've painted a decent picture, if you were the guy in the past, what would you say? 

""Nah, that's not going to happen, they would have banned it after bomb tests."" Maybe ""bullshit, nothing like that could exist."" or maybe you're future thinking, ""Why aren't they just making better and safer nuclear power steam engines or does it work in space""? 

I always like to think of those here as more future 'thinkers'. The prospect of that actually happening would be pretty freaking sweet. I'd love to see more nuclear powered ships for long space distances without solar... Hell once we start asteroid mining we could even just build asteroid mines for this crap. Use space-asteroid deposits of nuclear to refuel. As easy to get as water for long journeys. Why not?

There's dozens of arguments about the safe and security of the technology. There's dozens of arguments about how self driving cars should be programmed. We understand there are risks(war, health, destruction) to technology, but why say ""no technology"".

This leads to the next thought..

AI is complicated. It's fucking scary. The idea of saying no to it is easy. But the idea of perfect AI excites me, just due to the catalyst that it could become. Who knows, maybe we'll hit singularity in the next few years. But if you look at an example of ""AI"" today, you see it just exists is an advanced algorithm that learns variables by looking at the environment. It's neat and considered to be 'learning', but it's slow. It takes thousands of iterations to get anywhere. Don't get me wrong, Watson's pretty cool. He's an advanced search query engine, but that's all he is. A fancy Google search. Even so, Watson's pretty cool for medical stuff, but that's something of it's own. 

These are just a couple of mine that have been floating around and there ware never a great thread to mention them in. What are your guy's thoughts?",2,2

 Looking at education in general I see a very different picture, teachers generally seem to come somewhere between garbage men and traffic police in the eyes of an average person (even if the person in question is a parent.) When did teachers stop being a respected profession? For a very long time, it was seen as one of the few respectable jobs - if the 5th son of a duke was going to get a job, it would either be as a priest, soldier or teacher. Teaching was seen as essential to progress, Socrates was a teacher, we revere him now - but if he was alive today, he would be making the same cash as a Pizza Hut manager. 

 What went wrong? In a future where careers in teaching become less and less attractive, where do you see society going? ",16,12

Through some form of negative trade ""do this and I will *not* do that"" or ""do not do this and I will not do that""

Alternatively one can make a positive trade ""do this and I will do that"".

The trade can be repeated and the ""deal"" or ""relationship"" can persist over time.

""Don't flog me"" is a pretty common thing to trade for in a slave-master relationship. The master says ""do/don't do X and I will not flog you"". Fair trade. Or a mugger might say ""give me you cellphone and I will not stab you"". Fine.

Trade can be for anything, there are limitless possibilities for what things get passed around through transaction, there are contracts, currencies, stocks, food, services, houses, servants, periods of servitude etc. If you need these things badly enough, there is someone out there with the potential to control you.


The second part to being controlled/exploited is not having access to other options. 

1:""But I don't want to do X""

2: ""Then there is no deal""

1:""But I really need someone to do Y for me now (who doesn't also want me to do X)""

2:""There is no one else here who can do Y right now""

1: ""Fine, then I will do X""





The point is that if you have what everyone needs and can not get anywhere else you have tremendous leverage. Remember the plot of Deus Ex, where a small group of people create and spread a deadly disease which only they have the vaccine for. Prima facie, it is a fair trade, ""Do X and I will give you the vaccine"". But we do not want to see such a world.


The problem I see with UBI is that it would establish such a relationship between those who control the money and the rest of the population. People would need to ""Do X"" or "" not do X"" in order get their rations, they would have no other viable options. 


Of course, Ideally, the income would be unconditional. For how long would that be the case? How long before someone sees it as an irresistible point of leverage?",7,0

I just saw a post mentioning Obama saying that the idea would be considered in the next 10-20 years.


I've been thinking about it and I think it could (1) be harmful and (2) be a scam.


The idea of free unconditional money may sound awesome to most people initially. But here is how it could not be what it seems.


Right now, the value of our money is constantly decreasing due to the money supply being constantly inflated.


Suppose that they started giving free money to everyone, but along with this, they decided, hey let's increase the inflation rate even more by creating more money.


So right now, let's say I earn $10,000. And at the average rate of inflation, that money is worth 0.97x its value every year. So next year, it has the same buying power as $9700. The year after that $9400, and so on. After 20 years, the ""value"" of that $10,000 is close to half the original or the same purchasing power as $5000 now.


My point is, suppose they implement basic income. And I get $10,000. But they also ramp up inflation, to say an effective 0.5 yearly multiplier instead of 0.97.
But this would make it impossible to save any money and to break into the next higher socio-economic class.


A lot of people wouldn't think twice, wouldn't think about saving anyway, and would welcome such a policy. Especially, if the amount of free money increases with inflation. But it makes saving and moving up essentially impossible.


This could be perpetual slavery in disguise!
Anyone else sense that this is a scam?


As it stands right now, it is difficult to beat inflation unless you take risks and invest in the stock market, etc. I see no way to come out ahead if the inflation rate goes up to levels in the hypothetical case I mentioned above.",6,0

* The worker has a terminal on their Home PC which tells the Vehicle who to pick up, who to drop off and which routes to take.

* Camera facing the front of the road, back of the road &amp; pointing at the rider. Tablet mounted in the vehicle allowed for communication with the driver if necessary.

* Funds were split between the company, the driver, and the terminal.

If we want to fund UBI (Universal Basic Income) I think we're going to need to come up with a system that penalizes companies financially for not having human workers anymore.  I really don't like how regressive that is and I could certainly see it creating some weird byproducts (we pay 10,000 minimum wage to do literally nothing because it saves us more on taxes than we pay in salary) but I don't see another way around it.

--------
Imagine that you die, but shortly after you are cryogenically preserved - frozen.

In the future, they develop technology which can be used to revive you. All of the information has been perfectly preserved - your memories, intelligence, consciousness, identity, and everything else one could attribute to your mental, psychological, subjective self - your beingness, your existence, and so on. It's you in every sense, you're just unconscious; in a frozen coma, waiting to be woken up again.

However, although the freezing process preserved the information perfectly, your brain cannot be ""woken up"" without extensive repair. The cryogenisists, having studied your frozen brain, discovered interesting damage patterns evenly distributed throughout it: Each base constituent composing the information of your brain and mind (presumably brain cells and their connections) is cut in two.

The cryogenisists reason that the restoration process could be done much more cheaply and safely if they were to only attempt restoration on one half of the physical matter. Because of how your brain has been fractured, both halves would have the exact same information, therefore it is safe to use only one half or the other in the restoration process. Using both could complicate it, as (for whatever reason) it would be easier to replace the missing half than to stitch the two halves together.

To remove one half from the other, they invented a clever process: Instead of disassembling and reassembling one of the halves - which could be dangerous - they temporarily suspend your frozen body in 4-dimensional hyperspace. Using lasers, they carefully cut away one half of the matter from the other. Then, they move the half of the matter they want to extract through the fourth dimension as to not collide with the other half. 

With the extracted half, they begin restoration. Nanobots add material in gaps that were normally occupied by the other half. Soon, the repairs are done, they transplant your rejuvinated brain into a brand new, empty-headed body grown from your DNA. (Or a robot body, if you'd prefer that. Or a genetically engineered super body with four arms. Whatever floats your boat.) You open your eyes to discover that you are in a different room than when you closed them seemingly like moments before. You continue living, bouncing off to explore the future world you found yourself in.

Meanwhile, what you didn't know, is that in another room, the other half of your brain that they separated (reminder: both halves contain the same information) had also gone through the exact same restoration process at the exact same time. You bump into your other you on your way out of the cryogenisists' office.

Furthermore, at the same time, another team successfully extracted and rebuilt a third brain, also with perfectly restored and identical information. But how? Unlike the previously mentioned two, they didn't use matter that was directly involved in the functional mechanisms of your brain. Instead they inferred the information - with perfect accuracy - by analyzing the ice crystals that formed in the surrounding frozen supportive fluid and tissue that didn't play any direct information processing role. After extracting *this* tissue, they replace the missing physical components as before, resulting in now three functionally identical brains.

You then discover there was a fourth team. Rather than attempting to repair damaged or missing material, they scanned the brain and perfectly assembled a new one from scratch, also with identical information.

At this point, you and all of your clones are standing in the same room, staring at each other, mesmerized. Each one of you has been restored at the same time, but in different ways. 

Now that you think about it, you remember the cryogenisist explaining that you'd be restored via extraction and repair of damaged brain tissue. But, the other three clones of you have been told the exact same thing - or at least, that's what you all remember being told - and at least two of you have been lied to.

In your pockets, you find an envelope. The envelope contains a letter: either A, B, C, or D. The envelopes were placed in the pockets of your new bodies before you were restored, depending on the restoration technique that was used for the corresponding brain, in the order they were mentioned.

You open the envelope... and the card inside reads... &lt;omitted, what letter do you think it would show?&gt;.

Further, you wonder... have you just come into existence now, with memories planted into your mind that were not your own? What about the other three clones? Has the frozen person who died decades ago ceased to exist altogether?",4,3

Words like **accidentally** (""Company accidentally created an AI that can have a conversation!"") or **secretly** or **quietly** (""Company X has secretly/quietly been acquiring these AI labs."") 

To some readers, such phrases may seem innocuous, or harmless, and far more subtle than traditional clickbait phrases that apply to pretty much any news article. When it comes to futurology or technological breakthroughs, though, it has its *own* words that I think are rather unethical. It's taken me a while to really figure out precisely *why* I don't like them but now I think I have a firm grasp on why.

Take ""accidentally,"" for example. In our collective zeitgeist, we have historical, nostalgic reports of breakthroughs. Some stories may be exaggerated or even incorrect, but we react to them passionately. We grew up with them, we heard them repeated to us so much in school through childhood or saw them in footnotes in our favourite books or magazines. You know the ones - the fellow running through the town naked shouting EUREKA!, having the apple fall onto Newton's head, leaving stuff out in the lab and discovering penicillin, et cetera. We love those stories. 

But here we have modern online news articles using that word. *Accidentally*. Because, of course, why shouldn't we believe an article that used the word ""accident""? Why would someone report on such a thing? A blunder? A mistake? A goof? The presence of such not only plays to our passions and historical narratives, it has a psychological impact of ""Credibility must be higher, because they're including a goof and why would they, and we already know of instances of goofs leading to breakthroughs."" 

They know they're doing it, and they're doing it deliberately. And for other phrases, like ""quietly."" Well, it must not be so quiet if I'm reading about it on Reddit or can easily capture that information through a five second Google search. I feel like it's trying to gain credibility through exclusivity. We all hear common phrases like ""What people do in secret or behind closed doors really shows their true nature"" so the phrase is playing to our psyche. 

I detest these words' presence. *At least* phrases like ""You won't believe what scientists just discovered!"" are shameless, well known, and are merely playing to our curiosity. The phrases in articles to do with futurology are just downright sneaky.

However, as connoisseurs of future, we all know that to bring the future forth we need to throw trillions and trillions of dollar, on the expense of most people's standards of living.

Whether you like or not, Daniel Drezner showed that ""The System Worked"" - Ben Bernanke was right, he saved the global finance, and saved the system although it will not benefit most of the people.

Economic system has developed in a sense to limit the gains to the winners - and, unfortunately for the losers, not much for them.

So the time has been ripe for concentrating all resources of earth for future technology, and little for everything else (i.e. feeding and providing for billions of people from regions which didn't have too much to do with future tech).

A utilitarian, technocratic form of governance, similar to Singapore , Qatar or Bahrain where luxuries like freedom of speech are restricted but one can make money and innovate as much as possible, with little mercy on those who can't, should be introduced to finance the future and keep the civilization from decay.

Right now, you have to be a showman to get enough financing. Musk's shtick has a lot of holes, but he is the best we got now so we have to go with him even though he might not succeed.

And the mega institutions and globalism must continue unimpeded, so the world's resources and the last penny of capital can be fully utilized by future-oriented tech.

I have used the example of the Great War a few times, when the Western nations , rather than unifying and driving the Civilized world beyond the hands of the less civilized and reaching for something greater, instead pursued their own interests, and thru that goal armed what would be the Third World, leading to the current string of failed states and untold misery over there.

We have to , literally, force the people of the world to invest everything towards the glorious starfaring civilization which will utilize more and more of the space's resources.

Huk told me a few times about the L5 project, which was already proposed in the 1970s. It will have to be tried too.

Many people are optimistic and are citing numbers like 50 years or 70 years, but for me, we have two decades at most. 

Some people say we can't do a Manhattan Project because oil is scarcer now, but we might buy time with newer types of nuclear energy.

I feel that globalism and financialism are necessary, whether you like it or not, for one reason - they are needed to finance the future. If those who believe in, say, tribal interests gain power then we will stop short of a new civilization before chaos arrives, undoing most of the gains in the last century.",4,0

I tried it when I was a little kid back in the 90's and absolutely hated it.

It looks like it's a failure [as a gaming device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ0JTkBZdyw) for now. But it sounds like it's a smashing success in regards to [porn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVatvg_UyEA), but I think I'll try to avoid all that.

I think there's probably going to be a happy medium with interactive cinema. Maybe something between an RPG and a movie. But not a ton of fast paced interactive action, involving a high degree of coordination.

But at the [end of the game review](https://youtu.be/fQ0JTkBZdyw?t=18m43s) Jeff Gerstmann calls out how gross the headset gets after wearing it too long. All that body heat trapped in a sealed off area does get pretty gross.

So I think whatever experience ultimately ends up being, it's going to have to be something passive that you can enjoy in short doses. So I don't think this is going to replace our flat screens or take over gaming. I think it's just going to be a special treat for rare occasions. Maybe used a few hours a week. 

Edit: I just wanted to make the distinction between AR and VR. AR requires a completely different content design process than VR. And it has different hurtles to overcome.",42,5

All of the globe's debt is about $200 trillion.

Now, all of the measures to reach the next civilization won't be cheap. All easier pickings were taken out long time ago. 

We have to spend a dozen billion here, and another dozen billion here, to get all the wonders of the future which are tantalizingly close but still a bit far in a closer horizon.

I think that if we throw enough money, personnel and materiel we will get there before 2030, but no one knows how expensive it will be.

I think that if we can spend $50 trillion, out of the world's $200trillion net worth, we will get there.

That means everyone in the world must sacrifice 1/4 of their living standards.

Such sacrifices were made for short terms in the past - Japan levied a tax rate north of 50% during the Russo-Japanese war for 2 years.

Considering a lot of tax dollars are used for stupid things, they could be used for this but also a global tax could be levied to finance the future.

At all my local grocery stores and retail stores, far more people go through the checkout lines with human employees than through the self-checkout lines with no humans except (the one supervisor for the machines).  Moreover, at least one out of four people who use the self-checkout machines get some problem or other and the one person who oversees the four machines at my local grocery store is always too swamped with work and stressed out.

I find it hard to believe that robots will replace as many people as they are telling us all the time these days.  The self-checkout concept has been there for at least several decades, but still not taken over...and this is pretty simplistic AI technology.  Moreover, many customers prefer talking to a human at the checkout line, especially humans that they have known for many years.

1976,2016-10-18,2016,10,18,23,583yld,What An AGI Will Probably Look Like,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/583yld/what_an_agi_will_probably_look_like/,Yuli-Ban,1476799639,"[**Here's a very simple visualization**](http://i.imgur.com/gYw9iB0.png).

So at the top: a super neural network, composed of multiple meta-neural networks, each composed of multiple highly trained neural networks. The SNN is there to control all the others, to utilize each skill when necessary, and to filter all learning. Each of the lowest level NNs are what we'd recognize today as being AI e.g. the likes of DeepMind, Watson, Siri, Cortana, Google Now, Alexa, etc. They're all narrow AI, capable doing one task (or a few tasks) very, very well, but incapable of doing anything else. Put AlphaGo in front of a stove, and it wouldn't be able to cook you a meal. Sure, it could *learn* how to cook dinner, but it would require an entirely new system. And it also wouldn't *remember* how to cook that meal once you ask it to cook a new, separate dish. You couldn't cross DeepMind's Atari-playing algorithm with its Go-playing algorithm or this hypothetical cooking algorithm and wind up with an AGI. DeepMind has no ability to use multiple skills. 
Hence why progressive neural networks differentiable neural networks are so important. As impressive as AI is right now, it's only impressive coming from a perspective of having AI that's less intelligent than a paramecium.

But even the use of PNNs and DNCs isn't enough. So DeepMind finally manages to create a computer that can play Atari games, play Go, and cook. It still isn't generally intelligent. In order to further increase its efficiency, the DeepMind team will need to create an algorithm much like the ones it uses for these tasks except designed to learn how these various algorithms work and when to use them. In essence, a neural network made out of various neural networks. It'll find neural networks that are similar to each other and run them. This isn't deep learning, but an entirely new DL neural network that exists over the algorithm that *does* utilize deep learning.

There will be similar ""meta-neural networks"" for other similar tasks. It's not like there'll be a meta-neural network for each and every single algorithm or task just for each 'class' of tasks. 
 
Over all of them is an even larger neural network that is designed to know when to use even these meta-neural networks. It draws upon learned skills in order to navigate the world and manipulate objects, whether real or virtual.

This super neural network is essentially a digital brain. It learns new things by adding to its various meta-neural networks' classes of skills while also drawing from those skills, comparing new experiences to old ones, and learning unsupervised. It might be that you'd need memristors to achieve unsupervised learning, but it's possible that deep reinforcement learning could lead to it.

But in the end, you get human-level general intelligence. 

At which point, the only place to go from there... [is up](http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase2.png).

#**tl;dr**: we need to go deeper. Much deeper.

So much deeper that, if you compared our current progress to navigating ocean depths, DeepMind would be the depth of Lake Superior while AGI would be at the bottom of Mariana's Trench.",3,6

2032,2016-10-19,2016,10,19,7,586q5h,On the economics of basic income,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/586q5h/on_the_economics_of_basic_income/,mattstanton,1476828657,"As it stands, money flows from those who demand something of value towards those who supply something of value. As companies have a greater supply of value, people will demand more of it and also expect it at a cheaper price. This is basic economics: As technology improves the supply curve shifts right, equilibrium price decreases, and equilibrium quantity exchanged increases. Don't make fun of me for bringing in ""high school economics"" like some have done because it does actually apply or it wouldn't be taught. Anyway, things will get cheaper as Ray Kurzweil has said and become more abundant as Peter Diamandis has said. I believe they are both correct. The demand for labor will shift left dramatically, however, and the supply of labor will shift right dramatically. There is a question of which shifts more, but supply has a limit at the world's population and demand has a limit at near zero. The other question is: since these curves are *curved*, not straight lines like we see in the early stages of our economics classes, we have to know which one will be steeper. If the demand is steeper, meaning there is little reason to have more than a few workers, we're in trouble because a little bit of workers will be making a little bit of money and everyone else will be unemployed. If the supply is steeper, people will be making more money than if the demand was steeper and more people will be employed. Unfortunately, I would think the demand course would be extremely steep and the supply curve extremely shallow and crawling along the x-axis. Intuitively, I don't even think it will shoot up at the max population, but I could be wrong.

So the future looks bleak in terms of employment. However, my next question is: since very few people will have jobs and they will be making very little money, who is going to buy all if the products and services that the firms make? I believe in poorer countries where people have little money, suppliers have to lower their prices to sell anything at all, but the cost of production is also very cheap so they are still making a profit. It is a small one, but in a country where everything is cheap it works out. Using this analogy, the upper-middle through lower class in the Western world is going to be out of work and very poor, so goods and services will have to drop dramatically, which is fine since the costs will too. I still wonder where people will get the money, though, if very few people are employed. I believe that in order to receive money (value), people have to give value. Homeless people still receive money because people value their happiness, because humans have empathy. An efficient way to donate to the poor would be to instate a basic income that is paid for by the wealthy. Generally I believe in low taxes for the wealthy and trust in trickle-down economics, however when people have *no* money, unless everything becomes free (and maybe it will actually -- billionaires often have nothing better to do with their money other than help people. What can they do with it, really?), then I believe in *somewhat* of a basic income. It doesn't have to be nearly as much as people think it will, however. Thoughts?",57,16

Phones and cars are marketed in a certain way. From ""this will make you cooler"" to ""its the best new thing!"" Improvements are widely publicised and given lots of cultural add ons (Iphone users are hip etc).







Plastic surgery is marketed more subtly. Its advertised, yes. But its given less cultural input and more focus on self image. Not happy with yourself? We can change that.






Food and medicine is marketed least flashily of all as everyone knows what it is. New cancer drugs are publicised, but they dont really have much pomp around them. Its a ""wanna live? Give us money"" deal. Nice and simple.





So, if we get a life extension treatment, how do you think it will be marketed?

Europe in the Middle Ages was completely under the spell of the church. A lot of really smart people have written for the benefit of a God. During the preceding Greek period more ""free"" thougths (that were used by the thinkers in the Middle Ages for ages...) were made but most of these thinkers found ""slaves"" and ""e.g. women are weak"" very normal. Heliocentrism was a thing in ancient Greece (at least that one guy Aristarchus thought it made more sense) but it took a while before it was reinvented and, more importantly, accepted. Some people have been thought inferior to others for almost all human times (and still are sometimes), Darwinism, eugenics was a thing  Plato found really nice, and people really had to die in order to explain that Kings had no Godly right to rule etc.. I think you get the gist, I am no specialst. What I mean is that,  even the very ""wise"", who have always been present in humanity (I suppose), have been slave or product of their times and the assumptions of their times (obviously on about every subject some dude/lady has been far ahead or ?behind?, but it seems mostly on very specific subjects and not in general). The assumption is that we are insanely ignorant/barbaric compared to future generations.

My question is this:
____________________________________________
What do you think will be the next big disillusion?
_____________________________________________
Here are some examples:
Do you think property should remain hereditary whereas politics are not?
Is global capitalism doomed to fail miserably?
Is it an illusion to think we will keep advancing, or is it very plausible to fall into anarchy (in other words, is ethical and technological progress in function of time not necessarily true, can we fuck it up)?
Could it be that AI as we dream (nicely or nightmare) is unattainable?

I would love to hear some really nice remarks through the power of the internet!

A safety combination?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/58h39j/self_driving_vehicles_mobile_phones_wearables_a/,El_MUERkO,1476973305,"So I was having a dump and watching Tesla's self park and take the dog for a walk and do Elon's tax returns and I had a thought about the safety fears around self driving vehicles and I was thinking of possible solutions.

And I thought... what if future self driving vehicles, wearables and phones could communicate with each other when nearby to add an extra level of pedestrian safety. A longer range more precise version of NFC that acts like a transponder informing vehicles and other devices of their location, it'd be relatively close range, say double the safe stopping distance of the vehicle.

Kids are getting mobile phones at very young ages, my four year old has a Doki watch, I see kids as young as eight or nine with iphones. To avoid a form of financial divide in safety cheap 'safety bands' could even be given out to parents when their children start school or earlier, they could be unidentifiable to abate privacy fears.

There is a constant stream of pedestrian deaths on our roads, the reasons are diverse and complex and occasionally Darwinian but any extra layer of technological... 'padding' to autonomous vehicles will only ~~hasten the rise of our robot overlords~~ add to the acceptance of them on our roads which most studies agree is a good thing for overall safety.

Anywho... more of a shower thought but I figured futurology would better be able to tell me why my idea is completely unworkable and I should forever hang my head in shame :)",6,8

I find that being knowledgeable and creative with regard constitutional law is essential as any objection is strongest if it can be clearly rooted in the constitution.  I always start off every just selection explaining what the constitution is and what roles it sets out for the parties in the room.  I like to explain that the U.S. Constitution sets the parameters under which our government may function.  However, it is up to us to stop a process if it is operating outside of those parameters as it does not  happen automatically. I prefer to think of the constitution as mathematical as possible and explain it as an operating system, and that all of the laws passed by congress are more of the software and updates to that same basic operating system. 
The bill of rights acts as a manual override for any laws that are passed that would close pressure release valves or create an environment in which the people may lose control of our government. For example, without free speech, one can not in dissent, without freedom from search and seizure one has no ability to stand up to the government without great fear retaliation similar to the 8th Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment.
    The Bill of Rights have the general tone of protection from a tyrannical state.  This is not surprising if we remember that the U.S.A. was not born from blindly patriotism of gentleman but rather on the courage of stubborn revolutionaries.  That being said the constitution and the bill or rights are what was put in place by our founding fathers as a means in which these essential pressure release valves and protections can be protected.   It should also be noted that these rights are strongest when they are exercised in a political means to attempt to change our government.  This has been upheld time and time again by our courts. 
While rights such as free speech, due process, right to privacy, right to assembly and equal protection have been able to evolve in their implementation over the years the second amendment has been ignored like a relic of the past only embraced by gun nuts.  I think that this is a tragic mistake as the second amendment both by placement and wording is a much stronger amendment than it is given credit for.    The second amendment in part reads ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""   My issue with how we treat this is that we have not expanded it to new technological advances.  Just as the freedom of the press does not only protect newspapers, the right to bear arms should not only protect guns.   A 1700s definition I found defines arms  ""weapons of offense or armor of defense.""  In the 1700s for the strongest armament must have still been a rifle.  However, in today's digital age there are far more effective weapons of attack against a government and far more necessary armor of defense from the state.  We live in a digital age now and we must think of our constitution from that perspective.  Open access to the internet, encryption,  hacking software, TOR and anti surveillance software are some examples of armament in today's age.  These are serious tools that must be protected in order for our government to function and their is an avenue in place to do so if we get over our archaic view of the second amendment. 

TL/DR: The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms.  Arms can be defined as  weapons of offense or armor of defense.  In todays digital age these principles should be applied where they are strongest, that being in the realm of digital arms such as unrestricted internet access, encryption,  hacking software, TOR and anti-surveillance software.

Whether monarchy, democracy, socialism, Marxism, totalitarianism, fascism, or some form of religion...many flavors of governing the masses have risen and fallen.  And many, even those that have failed previously, have even been repeated.  Our past is littered with the conflicts and bloodshed of removing one to install another.

And regardless of the form, it's impossible not to notice a predictable pattern playing out over and over.  Those few given power to govern become corrupted by that power and the greed that so often accompanies it.

I do often wonder what the 'Ideal' method of government might be.  And I do often find myself drawn to the possibility of an AI government as it seems the only method capable of separating human fallibility from the necessary tasks of assuring that basic human needs and desires are met. 

Just as often, I wonder whether any such 'Ideal' is even possible given the human tendency toward wanting more...more than is allotted, more then our neighbor...the sins of our governments are a reflection of us as humans after all.  We're indeed odd and complex creatures.

So I ask r/futurology, what are your thoughts on this matter?  Are we waiting for AI?  Are we waiting for humanity to evolve?  Is it some of both?  Or worse, is it a pointless question because the flaws inherent to the human animal are unsolvable and we're on a collision course with self destruction?

But, we have become self aware and we suspect ourselves being in a program. Because of this, wouldnt our creators shut down the program before we somehow developed technology that could bring us out of this supposedly digital realm. And another reason we dont live in a digital realm is becuse the visual quality is infinite here. Any program that will ever be made will not have this quality. And, also there would be glitches and patches of matter that are disoriented or gone. And there would be pauses and updates which dont happen. And, theory states that the universe is infinite and infinitely expanding and will expand for an infinite time span, and computers just dont have the processing power for that kind of theory. So, i am on the side of this universe not being a computer program. And so , i ask you this question, what side are you on, and what proof do you have?",11,0

Almost by definition, increasing technological unemployment goes hand in hand with increasing post-scarcity. Think 10-15 years down the road when future Watson type medical Expertise AI can do most medical diagnosis.  Sure lots of humans Doctors will be un/underemployed - but that AI can be replicated endlessly out to 8 billion on the whole planet for pennies each.  

We don't have that just yet, but we could build post-scarcity college &amp; adult education - why don't we?

All the tech is there - you can see it with Coursea, Udacity, Khan Academy, etc, etc - but its all still on the margins of education.

Building a post-scarcity education system is much more achievable too; it doesn't require huge political change or a referendum 

Yet - even though UBI/technological unemployment &amp; post-scarcity are so closely coupled - why is it only one side of this equation seems to get all the attention?",68,53

I predict in the 2020s that cameras will be able to read our emotions and body language better than they do now. So if someone suddenly shows up and is giving off a large number of body language or emotional signals that something really bad happened, the camera will realize that and inform the right people. As a result, it'll be harder to get away with abuse. 

On that note, I think mental illness undiagnosis will become more rare for the same reason. Cameras will be able to distinguish small changes in our behavior, emotions, writings and body language that could signify the start of a mental illness. 

Right now, machine intelligence in the form of google greatly enhances our cognitive capacities. I think machine intelligence will do the same for our social and emotional skills in the 2020s. 

Other than that, I don't think strong AI will exist in 2020. Narrow AI will be better at more things. I think they will surpass humans at all video games (as opposed to the current crop of AI which can only beat humans at 3rd generation video game consoles). 

I think we will start seeing the benefits of devices like Watson in medicine and other fields. 

Self driving cars will be reasonably common. Not everywhere, but people will see them daily. ",10,19

But, in a utilitarian way, it is needed. Sorry.

It is a natural law that the better adapted displaces the less adapted, so it should not be stopped.

Also it is necessary to ignore all the moral hazards and other 'frictions' the leaders of the current systems have created, because if we replace them just because we did not like what they did, a lot of disruptions will occur which will retreat all the tech progresses.

Tech advances before people. More wealth to the top so the wealth could be used to finance costlier and more complicated projects.

Going to the space is not cheap. Musk's piecemeal strategy is not enough - he is doing what he can with what he can manage, but it is too slow. 

A system where the People enjoy a tolerable standard of living just spends resources and does not progress much.

The current sci/tech environment developed along with the lines of the current political, economic and diplomatic system. And we don't know what the alternative is, and finding it will take too much time and effort to be worthwhile.

Therefore, it is necessary to tolerate the actions of the p/e/d elites in order to preserve stability and make sure the future advances progress without any trouble.",2,3

Financial firms were collectively fined $110 billion as a result, which alone could solve world hunger for almost 4 years. The US spends $737 billion annually in defense, and 40% of all food in the US today goes uneaten.

Why is it when companies defraud and destroy the global economy we can come up with trillions of dollars to hand back to them, yet whenever anyone wants to address the cost of ending hunger nobody can fathom spending a few billion? For those that argue the politics or economics are too difficult to overcome to solve this problem, that is simply an excuse/illusion to hide the fact that there simply isn't any will power among us to fix it in the first place.

Global hunger can be solved quickly and easily if the planet simply decides to do so.",52,104

- Coaching/Sports Coaching [emotional, role model etc.]

- Celebrities

- Chef [traditional, family-run restaurants or elite restaurants, not brand-name restaurants like Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut etc.]

- Assistant to individual with special educational needs/disability

- Pop star/singer

- Race car driver [despite autonomous vehicles, this has emotion, man vs machine etc.]

I'm probably pretty nostalgic without realize it, but it feels like I have a pretty good grip on how boring my childhood was. I was bored all the time.

I had a couple video games, and I had to play them over and over again. They weren't the ones I love or wanted like Super Mario RPG or Chrono Trigger, my parents didn't have a lot of money to buy me games as gift or give me an allowance, and if they did have money, they certainly didn't think video games were a worthwhile use of money. I got stuff like Busby more often than not, most likely because they were found in a bargain bin or something. 

Finding something I liked was hard, and expensive, I had to cherish every little thing. Like, an exceptional good time for me was listening to Chrono Trigger midis for hours on end and daydreaming about playing the wonderous game, if only it were possible. Yes, I spent days *daydreaming* about playing Chrono Trigger and being immersed in its world.

And then I was a teenager and things got better, more graphics, more games, more technology, cheaper prices. Everything was getting easier, all the time. Can't find an affordable copy of Chrono Trigger, parents wouldn't even think about buying it for you? Piracy and emulators exist now! Welcome to teenage hood, take a Napster and a rom hosting site and get to downloading.

There was just too much time and too few things to do as a good. Again, maybe this has been my childhood psychology and the effects of growing up. 

But year after year, it feels like a kind of exponential growth. Growth in media to ""consume"", things to do. I ran the risk of having too much time and too little to do, years ago. And now it feels like I'm trying to swim through a neverending torrent of content. 

I've started to actually develop a little bit of anxiety and ""FOMO""(fear of missing out) over it. I could have basic income and no job and just be paid to be alive, and still not have time for a fraction of all the things I would like to do. 

I went from playing Pokemon Red and Blue over a dozen times and just desperately wanting finally something new to do and some new Pokemon, to ""oh my God, all these games! Being a Pokemon fan is a full time job, I can't keep up!"".

There's so much to do, I can't keep up with it all! One little fandom can easily be an endless hobby. Much less trying to be diverse in terms of hobbies and interests and passions. Want to make EDM music, want to make rock music, want to make any genre of music? Congratulations, there's already 50,000 artists making that type of music much better than you that almost nobody has ever even heard of.

Want to take up fanart and drawing in general? There's several million other people online from Deviantart to Twitter to tumblr to pixiv that are better than you dream of ever being, and almost nobody has ever seen their works, at all.

Say you wanted to play all of the video games that have ever existed. Good luck, even if you stop with all of the games made after 2010 and don't go any further into the future, only pre-2010 games for the rest of you life, in 100 years you will not be able to play them all, if you can even live that long.

Literally endless options, and they only seem to be exponentially growing. If there is any reason for me to believe that exponential growth applies to far more than just transistors and CPU chips, it is things like this.

I haven't been bored in years. Instead of having too little to do, I constantly have the feeling of too much to do. And have trouble committing to anything to do, because there's so much good stuff to do out there, I'm always considering my options. It is turning into an ever growing backlog of things to do, and I miss out on doing things I would love doing every day. Simply by virtue of it being impossible to keep up.

Is this just the world changing? Is it just less possible to get bored with all of the technology and all of the media and all of the hobbies and interests there are to do today? Or is this just me growing older, being an adult with a job and less free time, or psychological changes due to growing older?

It feels literally impossible to be bored today.

And to me, this is a sign that exponential change is really happening. We talk about the future happening sometimes. But to be honest, the world already feels like the future in some ways, when I take a step back from being accustomed to the constant flow of technology and amount of information I don't have the time to take in, and remember how different my childhood was, I realize that, despite not being very old, the world has changed rapidly during the time I have been alive. I've gone from a child with nothing to do, to an overwhelmed adult who cannot possible even keep up with my most niche of interests.

We're living in the future already and experiencing exponential change right now.",13,32

tl, dr: 

the tech advances are reaching a level that most jobs are not safe.

The owners of capital do not give a rat's ass about employees - their only concern is maximizing profit, which will be done by tech.

Economy has decoupled with human consumption, which won't be needed. It is a new paradigm.
===

Elsewhere I wrote that even Gail Tverberg, who beat many challenges, is not able to answer this ""Smite"" person and all she could tell the person was ""lol"", avoiding an answer.

The AI will reach just short of reaching a human level, so people like Sergey Brin would still be at the top, but most people paid higher than say, 10,000/yr, would be downsized. 

In the ancient days, the only consumers were kings and queens. The ministers and rich merchants consumed, but none of their consumption matched the level of the kings, queens and high priests.

and yet economy survived.

Since human consumption is not needed, those with the means have no reason to keep them alive and will simply stop selling to them, and the few homesteaders will have their lands seized, and their harvests destroyed by drones so they will join the throng of the starving.

What the Smite person seems to say is we are already at that level.

&gt;It is a total obsolescence. All of it will be gone. Left will be owners, their capital, machines and competent and capable people servicing that machine/computer based economy.


With that kind of arrangement, we don't need finance, politics, law, etc. All of them going into the dustbin. Politicians and expensive lawyers join the rank of the starving. Bankers? Try to collect from these sovereign individuals who will blast the banks into cinders.

For all practical purposes, the owners would have become GODs.

That means money will probably also go away. They could choose some new medium of exchange, like specialized fuels for space travel. 

With much fewer people on earth,resource shortage will cease to be a problem as well , and with all the time on earth space conquest can wait for hundreds or even thousands of years.

It is, probably, an Economic Singularity.

The effects to people like the Illuminati, the Bilderbergers, etc would probably be similar to what would have happened if Napoleon had listened to Robert Fulton's offer to sell steamships; if he listened to Fulton it would have been the monarchs of England, Prussia, Austria and Russia, plus Wellington and all that, who would have enjoyed their stay at the Bastille. Smarter ones will join the tech giants before the time, and less tech savvy elites will share the fate of Czar Nikolai II, who was, ironically, the one and only benevolent ruler of Russia it will ever have.",50,4

One of the participants, IBMs Chief Data Scientist also presented some advancements in neural networks and deep learning at an analytics conference in Berlin today. One of the developments he talked about was specialized hardware (ASIC) that could accelerate machine learning algorithms at the same rate as what GPUs did for graphics compared to traditional CPUs (hundred of times faster for the same price or watt usage). While those ASICs require adjustments made to existing code they can speed up machine learning tasks tremendously.


When asked about what comes after those specialized technologies that will enable us to do near-realtime analyses on datasets that took hours or days in the last years he replied with 
&gt; In the next few years both algorithms and hardware will be become much better and open up even more analytical potential. This will accelerate more and more and then, with the developments in the last years [see Alpha Go that beat a Go champion years ahead of earlier projections] recent estimates from fellow researchers put the Singularity at 2029, a full 16 years earlier than what Ray Kurzweil predicted in 2005. The more important question will be what happens at that time but honestly, nobody really knows.

While this might be a bit optimistic, it shows a tendency of narrowing in on earlier predictions as more knowledge about the way towards them becomes available.

3315,2016-10-29,2016,10,29,2,59vweh,The end of garbage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/59vweh/the_end_of_garbage/,mirkwoodgdp,1477677591,"It seems many of us are terrified of the looming garbage apocalypse. Were shocked by stories of massive garbage islands in the pacific, or steaming piles of electronic waste in Eastern Europe. Maybe we go to the supermarket with tote bags, and buy goods guaranteed to be made of recycled materials. We just cant get enough of sustainability. Of the environmental dangers of the future, one thing seems inevitable: the amount of garbage will increase. The basic theory goes something like this: even if first world countries can get their garbage under control via reduction, recycling, and reuse, the third world will inevitably increase waste per capita as it develops.

But maybe garbage is a problem that will take care of itself, without having to spend unsustainable cash on sustainable products. While Im positive that our capabilities in dealing with trash, via things like waste to energy plants, will become more effective with time, maybe there just wont be so much trash. The social effects of future technologies, and the effects of technology itself, will simply reduce the amount we consume.

I could go on for pages with examples of how this might work, but allow me give at least a few. Take something like the paper and cardboard waste stream. Specifically something like a newspaper. If technology had frozen in time in 1970, but population increased, the amount of newspapers consumed would increase exponentially with population. But has that happened? Of course not! This applies also to things like, magazines, catalogues, letters and bills. True we still have these things, but what will happen when the tech-native generation of today are the middle aged of tomorrow? Barring some unforeseen paper renaissance, I think most will be reading their news on an app and paying bills online. There goes the paper stream. At this point you might say, ok, paper is going down but cardboard is increasing with all this online shopping! True, but when drones are delivering our amazon purchases and pizza, there will be less need for heavy packaging.

Here are some other ideas. Think about how much waste is generated commercially. Will that still be the case as mega-stores shut down physical locations? All those empty boxes they have tied up in the back parking lot will disappear. Or, have you ever wondered why small things in stores have such large plastic packaging? Largely, to protect against shoplifters. But where will all that packaging go when we can 3D print something in our own home?

One thing that certainly will continue to grow is our e-waste stream. More people, more smartphones. However, device size is negatively correlated with technological advancement. And as devices become interconnected, people will buy less devices (think having a separate ipod and cellphone). I know even when Itunes when came out, I still bought a CD once in awhile. Now I have Spotify.

An interesting question will be if this garbage reduction will be counteracted completely by population growth and development. That remains to be seen. But it certainly will not be an apocalypse. So everybody, please relax.

 The term has been applifing its meaning recently, especially with the realease of new-gen games that atract public saying their characters have an advanced AI, but in this port we are refering to the following:
 
When we say AI, we refer to a software with the ability to generate information and use it without human interferation, a machine that can think, learn and act by itself... 

If you search the meaing of an intelligent being, you will find the following ''Intelligence can be defined as the cognitive abilitie to learn'', basically something that can learn certain information and then use it in the real world... and what does SA do? They follow users activity closelly, its interests, desires, played games and everything the user searchs on the internet, then, it finds the products related to the user's activity and display them strategically so they dont covert the whole page, but they still calling the attention of the user. All of this without human interference in the process.

Currently - in the debate about SDCs [self-driving cars] vs manual cars has some sources claiming a car is idle 95% of the day and in use 5% of the day - but does this also apply to gardens too? [the used vs idle discussion as seen on articles about driverless cars].

The garden in a house is unused some of the time, but how much, obviously it's weather-dependent? As a percentage - how much of the time is a garden in use?

Gardens are a desirable thing in the housing market - prestigious even, as we see on Location, Location, Location on Channel 4, and gardening is a multimillion-pound hobby, with B&amp;Q, Homebase, Tesco all being part of this market. [not sure who for the U.S., Canada and Australia].

Some houses never had gardens - the old West Towers Street, Hodge Lane, Langshaw Street in Langworthy, Salford, Greater Manchester, England [by where I live] were old Victorian slum streets laid out in a grid-iron pattern - similar to some American cities [Chicago, IL and Los Angeles, CA]. 

Since 2015 those streets have been gentrified and replaced with Florin Lane and St. Ambrose Lane as part of Pendleton One which started construction in 2008.

Will the housing estates of the future [aside from having minimal or very limited parking for human-driven cars] even have gardens, or will we have shared gardens [going along with the access vs ownership debate that is common within the tech blogosphere] replacing our own personal ones? Would this replace a city park, or supplement it?

I am someone who does enjoy gardening - was involved in my own large-scale DIY project that lasted from last September until middle of April this year - and would be interested to know your thoughts and opinions of this.

This is a discussion on societal change and attitudes - not about the technology [although if you wish to mention it, you can do so].

I would be interested to hear your views on this.",5,9

We have been working hard designing and testing our Hyperloop concept, and now fabricating a half scale, fully functional Hyperloop prototype: Goose I, to be tested on SpaceX's one mile long test track come January.

A Hyperloop is ultra high-speed long distance passenger vehicle that will be faster than an airplane, cheaper than a train journey, and is powered entirely by renewable energy.

If you are interested in learning more about Waterloop and our work so far, [check out our website](http://teamwaterloop.com)! We're also currently running a Kickstarter campaign, which you can find [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1629380361/waterloop-the-canadian-spacex-hyperloop-competitio).

Also answering questions today will be u/r3dm, u/chlovaltine, u/nickansh1, u/victor_waterloop, u/yazan_waterloop, u/robert_waterloop and u/starwaver.

Hyperloop specifically: when there are millions of self-driving cars on the road that can be summoned to any location instantly, not only will hyperloop serve no purpose, but most short and mid-range flights will be canceled. Certainly there are some speed advantages, but most people will care little for any speed advantage if they simply didn't have to drive. Then, as the freeways switch to full automation, speeds will increase drastically and even the speed advantage will diminish.

BTW I am convinced by Thunderf00t's videos that Hyperloop is impossible, but what I am saying applies to it whether it is possible or not and to any other infrastructure type of high speed rail. At this point, we should not be investing in these expensive impractical projects. They are not futuristic enough.",56,0

I view amputating teeth as backwards as Civil War field medicine. (No, Syrians, I mean [the American Civil War](https://www.google.com/search?q=civil+war+field+medicine&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii_cuetoTQAhUK0IMKHX-_AKYQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=635), over 150 years ago. BTW, those images aren't exactly work-safe.)


The last dentist I visited told me my far-right bottom tooth needs to be pulled because the top-front opened up (maybe an old filling broke off?) and bacteria will build up; apparently fillings will not be airtight therefore not prevent bacteria from getting through.

She didn't even suggest a root canal for some reason.

I would only remove an old tooth provided that socket would be *immediately* ready to regenerate a new one.

I regretted letting my previous dentists extract the top-far-right tooth last year; I was told a root canal (in that town) would've been $1,000. Instead of letting the tooth get pulled, I should've made a winter driving trip to Mexico and gotten the root canal for a fraction of that price.

Thankfully, that socket isn't even visible; having *visible* teeth pulled would've harmed my job and marriage prospects!

---

All that aside, **where are we on stem cell tooth regeneration?**

I'll wait through the pain of the toothache to have that. All that the pain does is prompt me to brush / mouthwash / floss more, and the pain usually subsides afterwards.

And ""pain is weakness leaving (your) body."" ""What doesn't kill (you) makes (you) stronger.""

---

I may hop to different dental offices in my current town and show them the x-rays once I obtain copies. If they say ""all we can do to remedy that is a tooth extraction,"" I'll assume their methods and equipment aren't sophisticated enough to try something else and will keep hopping from clinic to clinic until I finally get a different answer.

But if you tell me where I can get tooth regeneration treatments, I may not have to hop like that.

Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5abwso/were_mit_media_labers_who_built_an_echolike_ai/,rsp5y,1477916605,"Hi r/Futurology! My friend and I started a project that has gotten a lot of momentum, and wanted to see what you all think. Its a Jarvis-like AI that uses HDMI pass-through to control and overlay content on your TV (we think this is the future that sci-fi has been talking about for years).

&amp;nbsp;

[Project site \(with video\)](http://diatom.tv/veil)
&amp;nbsp;

We built this because Amazon Echo &amp; Google Home were a bit of a let-down. Theyre not really assistants so much as servants; they cant do anything without being told, and dont know whos using them.


&amp;nbsp;

Our AI-device is:

1. Proactive - it anticipates needs and shows information on the TV without being asked. A speaker can never to this without blurting out. That would get annoying.
2. User-aware - its always helpful to the current user (or group of users) and accesses their accounts automatically (current AIs are tied to one account).
3. Always-ready - our device sits BETWEEN your TV and existing media boxes. It overlays content on every input, so you never have to change input to use it. It's always ready to help and even manages input switching (which is a terrible experience for most people).


&amp;nbsp;

Would love to hear your thoughts on whether you think AIs will take to displays in the coming years!
