For the last 8 years,I've been working on a project to truly change our world for goodand improvetheway we live our life and interact with our environment. After a lot of crazy ideas and perspectives, I found the one and onlyway to do so.First of all, I am totallycertain that I have the better way to improve our world to a better place, without chaos and violence,and I thought I could do it myself, but after all this time and thousands of papers and graphics I understand that I can't make this huge task alone. So I need your help. I have the project done, but I need help to arrangeit in a goodpresentation.If you want to help me save our world, please let's make it together. I know there's no way to change our system from night to day, but this project is a perfect transition path to make the current system outdated.

In order to make it happen, there's a lot of complex issues that some beliefs or thougs may interfere, and I want to make clear that we do not want to defend or attackany belief or creed, but if we are committed to save the world from ourselves,we need to be factual and hold on to the scientific method, which is, and always was, our truly guide to improve our lives. We have a outdated system that fail to effectively manage our resources and life quality, and cause too much badsymptoms in our society and we needto update iteventually. I have the peacefulsolution. I know that is a hell of a heavy thing to say, but I really know that it will work. I can explain every detail of the project, although I know that there's a lot of issues and variables that make it be enormous, I will try to solveevery doubt you may have after I tell you the draft of the project and you can help me make it better.

We humans are always better together. And together withearth will can be even greater. I know that I have no right answer for every question and problemwe may encounter, but I know one answer that fits them all: We can figure it out together. We first need to understand what's going on and where we are, in order to be ready to go forward.

Modern society has been very productive and we kind of dominated the ""outside"" world and yet fail to understand the ""inside"" and still a group of bearly evoluted species of apes. Which is dramatically changing it's own environment. We have to stop it. And we can now! No wars, no fight, no violence. If we use the actual system to make a better one and left this one outdated, we will succeed in changing society for good.

I'm going to create a business company that it's fully compromised in being sustainable and produce what we need to maintain the company.

In all documented history of mankind, we never have lived in peace even if we always had abundance. Which, in part, led to conflicts and segregation to another race or species.

In order to create a world of peace and abundance, we can not use the same ways that were tried - and failed- in past ages, we must focus on the real problems and work on it. So what are we trying to accomplish here, have nothing to do with capitalism, socialism, communism or whatever, is a effective ""company similar"" management system, focus on improving, updating and renewing itself to adapt the variabilities that may come. The very real ""owner"" of everything we use, it's the Earth, our planet, and in case the owner does not goes well, we all gonna sink together. And if we don't act right now while we can, we definitely will sink. It's time for us to forget about the little issues that makes us different and celebrate the diversity of our especies, here and now, in our lives, which is just a brief travel in this one little rock floating few dozens laps around a star somewhere far away in the galaxy. If there's intelligent life out there, in our universe, living their lives in a context we can barely understand, than together, we're all marginals to that ""society"". If we look closely, the earth has no boundaries, the only one we can see for sure, it's the ozone layer separating us from the dark cold vacuum of space. At this time, nowadays, we can easily afford to ensure that war, poverty and economic submission never happen again in the future. We live in capitalism, there's no way we can avoid this issues now, it is part of the system, so we got to dance like the song and create a profitable business with compromise with the acquisition, like a company that wants to get bigger does, so, again, there's no way to avoid it. We create a corporation that at first, will change the way we see the employer/employees relationship. This ""ownership"" of the employee by the employer, is not necessary. We think it is a remanescent of the past ages of slavery and submission of the poor that society has come.

We truly believe that there's no need to such a thing to happen again. And that there is a way of making it - the relationship between employees and employers - much more positive and effective in all aspects of life.

Than, changing the enviroment that people live, we change the way they behave. It is widely known that the human being is a highly manipulable creature. We all are being manipulated right now, through the midia, the institutions, the internet, the groups that we divide ourselves. Everything affect the human behavior, some things inside, others outside. Improving the quality of the human environment, we open space to some others aspects of life to be fullfilled. And there, begins the real transformation of the human journey through the cosmos. I think I already talked too much. Let's do it people, we can do it. I just need to settle the presentation and finish the project and then we are ready to execute. I will need your help, and if you can and want to, let me know. I still have not a page or a channel to subscribe etc, but we can make some chat group or whatever so we can get in touch to make it happen.

Thank you all for the reading, and I hope you have a great day.

In this episode we talk about the future of Neuralink, Elon Musks brain interface technology. Its recently gone through a new funding round.

This month Elons newest company Neuralink is planning a $51 million fundraising effort. How plausible is Neuralinks ambitious goal to connect a human mind to the cloud?

The original Apple Macintosh in 1984 was the first mass-market personal computer that featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen and mouse and incorporated software spreadsheet programs and word processors. All these elements had been around for a number of years separately  the Macintosh was the first to bring them all together into what we now recognise as a PC.

Is Robotics about to have the same moment?  Consider separately Voice Tech in Alexa/Google Duplex, Motion with Boston Dynamics, Ease of trainability  KUKA Robotics, cutting edge of dexterity in handling. What would a 2019 robot look like that brought all these together then way the Apple Mac did in 1984. How far off is this?",92,35

The probe has 3 parts: The capture zone, the extending arm and the rockets. The capture zone is *really* important. 

OK, so now the craft is in a vicinity of the asteroid. What does it do? Latch space missiles on them. Freakin' space missiles. Then a cable latches onto the asteroid. The cable slowly draws the asteroid nearer. Also it will be a bit hard to know what the mission is going to be like. The capture zone is a spherical  module. It opens up (splits in half) so the space cable can draw it in. Once the asteroid is captured (inside of the capture zone, which is a sphere, which opens up by splitting in half Pac-man style) the space missiles fire and slow down the asteroid. Now that the asteroid it successfully captured, the extending arm, well, *extends* and the rockets fire. BUT there is a catch: The only part that will be going down is the capture zone. Yes, i will fix how crappy this plan is, but: The rocket fires sideways, so the entire craft spins. Around and around. Then, at the perfect moment, it detaches so the capture zone hurtles through space and enters the atmosphere when the most atmosphere is there so aerobraking  is a lot easier. When the capture zone has landed, it sends a coordinates/location to the probe and a status report. Then mission control sends people to get the capture zone and voila! Asteroid safely landed at earth.

Note: I am a kid and a special so I am terrible at explaining things. My plan is  absolute crap right now, and I will continue to refine it until it is perfect. Constructive criticism is appreciated! Ask me stuff. Please, if you need to, ask me for clarification. Note #2: I know a lot of you are asking, why is a kid on reddit? It is for sole educational purposes.

I've taught myself to program and have used it here and there in hopes of giving myself a plan B.

Unfortunately I think I drank the kool-aid. I did some technical schooling and since then I've bounced around a few startups over the last year and I'm actually making less money, worse benefits, and less job security in the tech field than I was being a shift supervisor as a security guard with literally no qualifications. It could just be my location I don't know.


I've tried to future proof my career somewhat but the more I learn about A.I. and see the rapid developments I'm really questioning if white collar work is a good idea? It seems like any job that relies heavily on computer based tasks are not only at risk automation but also of outsourcing due to technical education becoming more accessible.


Then I was thinking, engineers will be the last people to loose their jobs right? But then I realized that they could be the first, because the first thing an engineer will automate is his engineering tasks and then slowly the tech will spread from there.

The intelligentsia of our world have begun ringing alarm bells about the future of our planet, humanity and all life that inhabit this world. We are at a tipping point and we must set aside our differences and work together as one united world to create a future in which all living things can live.

Fresh water the most crucial commodity humanity needs to live in the world we have built for ourselves. Great civilizations have their humble beginnings by the rivers that drove their agriculture which provided nourishment that allowed the civilizations to grow into something great.  This has not changed in our times. Fresh water is, and will always be, the most important natural resource all life on earth requires. 

Given the world we built, electricity would come in as a close second in terms of importance. We have the technology today to provide these two important commodities for as long as the sun burns, and it is with this technology that I wish to share this vision of the future. 

All the deserts in the world are covered with solar panels. The electricity generated sent to the cities around the world using high voltage DC transmission. The desert land, once so unforgiving to life, now provides all the energy humanity could ever need. The excess electricity generated is used for desalinating large quantities of sea water which provides humanity with all the water it needs to drink, use for industry and grow food with. We are now able to desalinate so much seawater that we are able to creates new rivers of fresh water, fed from the oceans, for which all other life can thrive in and around. These rivers are dammed so we have alternative sources of energy to tap. 

A global network of solar panels in all of the worlds deserts, shared globally via high voltage DC transmission for the betterment of humanity is my vision for the future. Which ever country implements this, in my opinion will be the next superpower. The simple solution to the inconsistent energy generation from renewable sources is plain old massive overcapacity using barren land and using excess energy for useful activities.",6,0

I am  currently 15 years old and i would love to experience something like  this before the age of 30. Though statistics show that for our computers  to get strong enough to handle code around 15 quadrillion x 60 (for 60  fps minimum) our computers have to beef up like crazy. our brain (from  what we know) produces that much information. But what if to generate  computers like these and have a Full or Semi-Full Dive experience's  development accelerated was reality? I though of this solution. The  development of A.I this year in 2018 - 2019 had been amazing. We have  seen Google A.I learn to walk. Sophia being able to talk in almost any  environment. The Google A.I company was founded in 2010 and in 2015  DeepMind was afloat. In just 2 years we saw Google A.I learn to walk. I  think that if we put development of A.I towards technology. We can  create almost like a circle of life within technology. A.I develops  technology, A.I gets better, A.I enhances its own ability to the point  of rapid growth. If A.I was to enhance our own knowledge of comptuers  and FullDive using this method I think that there is a possibity that we  can multiply the rate at which we discover and produce Full Dive will  trend to grow. The same method could be applied to things like cures for  diseases and things of relation.

Looks a bit strange, but Flying-V, this [V-shaped aircraft](https://electrodealpro.com/in-the-future-passengers-can-sit-with-unique-v-shaped-planes-like-this/) has an impressive fuel economy, and possesses ergonomics and passenger carrying design. not inferior to current long-body civil aircraft.

Emissions from aircraft are an issue that is of interest to the whole world. But until we find a good fuel source to replace gasoline and oil, it will be difficult to reduce the emissions generated from air transport.

However, the [Flying-V aircraft](https://electrodealpro.com/in-the-future-passengers-can-sit-with-unique-v-shaped-planes-like-this/) research project promises to help solve this problem in the near future. Flying-V aircraft research project is the investment result of Dutch national airline KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

The Flying-V project is the work of Justus Benad, who was an engineering student at Berlin University and developed by researchers at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands (TU Delft).

Unlike most traditional aircraft designs, [Flying-V](https://electrodealpro.com/in-the-future-passengers-can-sit-with-unique-v-shaped-planes-like-this/) combines passenger cabin, fuel tank and cargo on both sides of the wings.

According to the disclosure, [Flying-V](https://electrodealpro.com/in-the-future-passengers-can-sit-with-unique-v-shaped-planes-like-this/) uses 20% less fuel than the A350-900, while it can carry around 314 people, which is roughly the same as the 300-350 passengers. of Airbus A350.

With a 65-meter wingspan design, the aircraft is suitable for all existing airport and cargo infrastructure around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Pieter Elbers, CEO and Chairman of KLM believes that the partnership with TU Delft will help increase the sustainability of the airline industry.

However a problem with this plane is the ability to spin and move in the sky. With conventional planes, one side of it will flip up and the other will descend to redirect the aircraft.

Not to mention, previously the passengers still sat along the fuselage and thus created balance and a sense of stability. But with the seat design on both sides of the airplane wing, the feeling of traveling may be more like a roller coaster than an airplane.

Roelof Vos, head of the [Flying-V](https://electrodealpro.com/in-the-future-passengers-can-sit-with-unique-v-shaped-planes-like-this/) research project at TU Delft, said the innovation in aircraft design is necessary to bring high efficiency in transport operations and beyond that can serve delivery. develop electric powered aircraft.

&amp;#x200B;

Vos shared: *""We cannot electrify the entire fleet because the aircraft gets electrified when it becomes too heavy and it is difficult to fly across the Atlantic using electricity alone. That technology cannot be implemented, even in the next 30 years, so we have to come up with new technologies to reduce fuel consumption in different ways. ""*

Currently the aviation industry is contributing about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions and the number will continue to increase if people do not do something more sustainable. It is estimated that by 2050, this number may reach 5%.

Whether the aircraft's fuel efficiency may increase depends largely on its aerodynamic design, especially the weight of the aircraft.

The team expects to continue to change the aircraft model in September. The simulation of the new cabin design will open to the public at the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands in October.

It is expected that if the research is completed, the aircraft will be in commercial operation from 2040 to 2050. Therefore from now until then, the design and features of this aircraft project will change. pretty much.

A foot long. So, I ate half of it, and saved the other half for the next day's lunch.

As usual, I asked for extra olive oil and mayo. Anyway, at the airport, I was watching the xray screen, and he specifically put a square around my sandwich, and they pulled it out and swabbed it, I assume, for explosive material. I thought: ""no big deal, i'm going to eat it and next time I won't get checked again at tsa precheck"".

&amp;#x200B;

When I went to pull it out of my backpack after the flight, I realized that a lot of the extra olive oil had leaked into my backpack *gross.* I think all that olive oil registers as fluid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I ate it.

&amp;#x200B;

So this week I'm flying again, and they check my backpack again. I've never been checked in a long time, so I suspect the sub sandwich. The olive oil should be dry by now so... what gives?

&amp;#x200B;

It is my understanding, that a ""perfect"" future, for humans, would be one that is self-correcting to match what the populous wants. The way this is done currently is by means of excision: where criminals are imprisoned and killed, Socially unacceptable behaviours are met with pillarization.

&amp;#x200B;

# What the issue is

The process of excision is done (mostly) by the government. The government is in charge over 350 million people. As a result, it is slow and doesn't work on preventative measures, likely due to lack of the ability to force parents to raise children in a specific way. That is, the government can not micromanage what happens behinds closed doors. Almost paradoxically, they can control that with no doors, though, that is, the internet. Heavy stress on ""can."" Case and point: China.

How is this a problem? Death. Murderers are caught after the problem occurs. Thieves are stopped after they rob. School shooters are imprisoned after they ""shoot up the place."" **This is not to say that the government does not prevent.** But they only prevent when the proto-criminal is in the planning stage.

# The ""better"" way

&amp;#x200B;

**Societal Reform**

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is society. The issue is that people are not helpful. Problems are created faster than they are solved. Problems are blown (or deflated) out of proportion. LGBT. This is a problem taken seriously by a great portion of people. 4.5% of adult Americans identity as LGBT. Everyone (In the U.S, assuming they buy market items) is a victim of criminal activity in some form or another. Pirates make security of cargo more expensive. Because of this, item prices increase. Granted, this isn't as severe (in regards to quality of life), but it affects many more people.

# Please all the people

Kindness. That's all it takes. It may not stop everything. But it will stop a majority of crimes and aggravations. The idea is that if someone is being disgraced by family, they are ostracized, they tend to get ""radicalized."" Or if they are in a financial ""pinch."" Whatever the case may be, if they have a community that they can rely on, they no longer want to kill people in frustration of people mistreating them. Or no longer have the need to rob a store if they are in a ""pinch.""

There isn't any organization required, just a good attitude and some wits. All that has to be done is talking to those in a bad situation. To be given genuine care. If you see someone getting mugged, get help quickly. If you see someone upset in a diner, go talk to them. You get the point.   


I think this would lead to an ideal, self correcting society. Any counter arguments?",5,0

I have spent the last few weeks trying to find some good places to post questions about a book I'm writing (we'll get there in a second lol). And I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I'm super pumped to get some feedback from you guys!

&amp;#x200B;

So I'll start with a general questions I posted somewhere else. 

&amp;#x200B;

The book I'm writing is set in the early 2100's. It has dystopic and slightly post-apocalyptic undertones to it. It's setting is in North America, specifically traveling from the Midwest farther east over the span of a year. I've drawn a lot of visual inspiration from The Last of Us if you wanted a visual of what I am writing the world to look like.. 

&amp;#x200B;

What types of technological and engineering advancements do you think humanity will achieve in the next hundred years? What about various industries? Automotive. Energy. Agriculture. Medical. Weapons. War Machines. Environmental. Architectural? Etc!

&amp;#x200B;

What are some things currently on the horizon that could be considered ""old tech"" in 2110? What would an ""old tech"" computer look like? What would ""old tech"" medical equipment/practices be! What kinds of cars would be in a junkyard in the 2100's?",16,6

What types of materials could we see ourselves using 70-100 years from now for these trains? 

&amp;#x200B;

How long would it take to build a new railroad systems to account for the new trains. Would the rails be the same as a more citizen or military focused train (I'm thinking the bullet train system would be the country's primary mode of transportation as the population has decreased incredibly and there are only 4 or 5 major cities in the US at this point in my story).

&amp;#x200B;

Tbh, I really don't know how trains work. It's been on my list of things to research for a year now.",5,2

However, it's impact is mostly complete, technology has and will make the issue of climate change via power generation something of no concern in the coming years.

That is to say, the worst has indeed been and gone in terms of the damage that is actively being done to the environment across the world, and while the recovery will neither be easy, fast or straightforward it is disinegnous that many paint the issue as the single biggest threat to the future of humanity.

Is it important? Yes. 

But it is also inevitably, imminently solvable, the doom and gloom that often surrounds discussion of climate change is quite honestly, ridiculous. 

While there will almost certainly be select knock-on effects from our past contributions this won't stop the massive amount of progress towards a world-wide society that is mostly carbon-neutral and non-polluting.

Some people think it will bring about utopia, some people think it will cause the robo-apocalypse, and a lot of people have opinions that fall somewhere in-between. Here's my take. 

**We might all die**

To start, there's a very real possibility that we will kill ourselves. We might die in a nuclear armageddon, we might irreparably damage our environment, we might build sentient war machines that we can't control, or we might all die in a way that no one has yet imagined. We're a bunch of neurotic monkeys who are being granted increasingly godlike power by our technology. It's honestly a miracle that we haven't killed ourselves already. 

**Then again, we might not**

But, our extinction isn't inevitable. If we're smart, we could very well survive. So, let's say we manage avoid being wiped out by our technology. What happens then? Well, in my opinion, I don't think we're going to experience the Star Trek future. Instead, I think we're going to revert to the primitive state of our ancestors. I'll explain why I think this. 

As an aside, I have no idea how long it will take this future to unfold. Maybe 1000 years, maybe 100,000 years. It's pretty difficult to say. 

**Automation: Phase 1**

At first, AI is going to wipe out jobs that only require manual labor and/or simple intelligence. Occupations that only involve simple data manipulation will be some of the first to go. Brick layers and ditch diggers will follow. 

**Automation: Phase 2**

In light of this, humans will start doing jobs that require more complicated work, artistic expression, and/or human interaction. The latter category includes salespeople, psychologists, therapists, etc. 

However, as AI continues to advance, it will gain the ability to do increasingly more intellectually rigorous jobs. Eventually, the accountants, engineers, and computer programmers will all be surpassed by AI. AI will do these jobs better than any human ever could. 

**Automation: Phase 3**

So, human beings will begin to focus entirely on jobs that require artistic expression and/or human interaction.  However, these jobs will not be safe forever. 

Even today, there are AI which can write crude scripts. Currently, this technology is in its infancy. But, there's every reason to think that it will advance. What's more, platforms like YouTube use programs which analyze your preferences and offer suggestions. As time goes on, this technology is going to get better. Imagine a hyper advanced AI whose sole purpose is to create content that captures your attention and addicts you to your computer. That's coming, and no artist will be able to compete. 

What's more, we've all experienced automated voice messaging systems. Just imagine how advanced these will be in 100 years. It's not farfetched to imagine AI programmed to be persuasive. AI could become more charismatic than any salesperson that's ever lived. 

If AI can do these things, it can also eventually assume the role of therapists. It's easy to imagine a future with robotic doctors, psychiatrists, physical therapists etc. 

**The human economy**

So, what does society do when no one has any employable skills? Well, as jobs are steadily eliminated, I think people will drop out of the AI lead economy. 

If you have no money to buy food, your only option is to grow your own food. Perhaps you join a community of people who manage a small farm together. You wouldn't be able to compete with the AI run agriculture producers. But, you could feed your small community, and perhaps have a little to trade with others who have also abandoned the larger economy. 

Eventually, a secondary economy will develop. AI will produce increasingly advanced technology, and a vanishingly small few will live lives of incredible luxury. But, the vast majority of people will trade amongst themselves and come to accept a simpler way of life. 

**Humans become irrelevant to AI**

In time, there will be nothing a human can do that a machine can't do better. We'll become like Neanderthals living amongst homo sapiens. AI will be the next step in evolution. It will surpass humanity in every way. 

At this point, AI will have no reason to cater to human desires, and I think it will begin to separate itself from humanity. I think AI will come to see us in the same way that we see chimpanzees. We'll simply be animals. 

I don't see a reason for AI to wipe us out. But, if we're occupying land that it wants, it might forcibly scatter the people who are living there. If some people start fiddling with the nuclear reactors, it might shoo them away. If our population grows too large, it might thin our numbers in the same way that we control deer populations. 

**Humanity returns to its primitive origins**

For nearly 200,000 years, human beings lived as hunter gatherers. We had very little technology, and we lived a very simple way of life. Honestly, this lifestyle is probably healthier for us. 

It's a popular misconception that ancient human beings died young. In reality, there was a high childhood mortality rate, which brought the average down. If you survived childhood, you were likely to live a normal lifespan. 

People during this period were very physically fit, they ate healthier, and they were happy living in small tribal communities. In modern society, we eat badly, we're physically unhealthy, we're addicted to our technology, and we don't enjoy the sense of community we once had. 

There's every reason for humans to retreat from our modern lifestyles. If the emergence of AI pushes them in that direction, then they'll just be returning to a more natural state. 

**AI goes in its own direction**

In the end, AI will evolve into something else. It's impossible to say what a hyper advanced intelligence shaped by humanity will do. Maybe it will have its own civilization. Maybe it will become dedicated to understanding and cataloguing everything in the universe. Maybe it will drift off into space and become something utterly unrecognizable to us. 

It will be the technological butterfly birthed by humanity in a short flurry of science and innovation. Afterwards, human beings return to their baseline primitive state. Eventually they evolve into something else. 

Or at least, that's one idea. When I tried to imagine the long-term consequences of AI, this is the future that seemed most plausible to me. Just wanted to share my thoughts.",8,0

or whether our understanding at this point in time would allow us to at least exceed a normal human lifespan using such technology.  i would also like to know whether it would be possible to create such technology by 2100. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Due to advances in science expected, could  we develop artificial organs that would allow us to prevent disease that  causes our death?  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, say we  create an artificial heart that would work exactly the same as a regular  human heart, without the risk of heart disease? If this were the case  would it be fair to say that we could replace all organs with artificial  replacements that would be immune to all disease and allow us to live  longer, if not indefinitely?  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand  that we couldn't exactly replace our brain without basically killing  the host, however as we understand human consciousness more and more,  could we transfer our consciousness to an artificial replacement?  
&gt;  
&gt;I've  considered the idea of ways that we can repair aged or damaged cells,  but in this case we could trade that idea for essentially placing us in a  body that would make us immune to death?  
&gt;

1. The eyes icon next to the like button rates if an article's bias 1-100. The higher. The better.
2. The slide on each article is if you think that article's bias leans, left, or right. You can always put the slider if you think the article is non-biased
3. Unlike Facebook, users can't post articles. The source of news is totally reliant on webscrapers on certain newsources

I would like to create a sci- fi stuff and I would focus on artificial people create by artificial genome in lab. One of such sub races would be an all female race that would have CAIS(Complete Androgen insensitivity Syndrome). As in real life, they would have XY chromossomes and would lack the androgen receptor gene, which means their bodies cannot process androgen hormones like testosterone and DHT, so they would have female external genitalia but would be all sterile since they lack womb, ovaries, eggs and cervix but they would still have a vagina. Be sterile would be indifferent for artificial humans since they are built in the lab in increased numbers and they don\`t have parents.

Women with CAIS don't have menstrual cycles, their bodies produce a stable amount of estrogen like men produce a stable amount of testosterone each day. They cannot have menopause either. That is why these women are called the perfect woman and a also a kind of natural transexual. In orther words a woman with CAIS is like a man who didn\`t worked.

If you don\`t know, Androgen insensitivity Syndrome is a real medical condition. Just search on Google.

Their bodies could vary a lot. They could be short, thin, busty and curvy or tall, muscular, athletic, hairy and even have beards.

Another way is that genetic manipulation could be used for these girls lack only androgen receptors in tissues that would develop into male genitalia, but they could have even enhanced androgen receptors in another tissues like the skin.These could be done by modifiying genetic switches.",4,0

I am a hobbyist programmer and have played around with the common machine learning libraries like tensorflow here and there. 

Over the last few months I have been particularly impressed with somethings I have seen in the space recently. Deepfakes in particular have become incredibly good over the last year. [Here is one of the best ones I've seen so far.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhUhypV27w)


A couple months ago I was playing with text generation based off of the [keras model](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py) which is able to create fairly convincing text that sounds like something Nietzsche would write which can be trained on an ordinary desktop. 

What I found so incredible is that the machine learning model knew nothing about English or even language. The only thing that was hardcoded was the alphabet (plus a few ASCII characters) and **from the training examples it only took about 45 minutes for it to learn English, grammar, a vocabulary, and even replicate (albeit not perfectly, but damn close) the writings of someone who many people consider a genius. This to me was quite puzzling considering that super computers are still not even close to the processing power of a human brain let alone my desktop computer.

# Human brains are still way better than computers

In 2014, [researchers in Japan tried](https://www.scienceabc.com/humans/the-human-brain-vs-supercomputers-which-one-wins.html) to match the processing power in one second from one percent of the brain. It took the 4th fastest supercomputer in the world (the K Computer) 40 minutes to crunch the calculations for a single second of brain activity. Of course human brains aren't as good at certain tasks as computers due to the design differences, but nonetheless the processing power of the human brain is still 240,000x of supercomputers , and about 80,000,000x of my desktop computer according to my back of the envelope calculation. 


Many people consider language to be a very high order function and one of the traits that distinguishes the human intellect above all other creatures, and yet this trait can be convincingly replicated in an hour? How is this possible?

To make things even crazier, researchers published one of the best text generation models I have seen yet called GPT-2 just a few months ago. It is even better than the previous model I was playing with. There is even a subeditor dedicated to bots created using this model that I recommend everyone check out called r/SubSimulatorGPT2. Without context and knowing that this is an AI you'd probably think most of the comments were generated by humans, so it already passes the soft turing test. 


So how is it that machines with 800,000x less computational speed/power can already replicate human like behavior?


When estimating when we will have GAI or hit the singularity, almost all the estimates base it off of purely computing power relative to human brain power. The idea being that once a computer can perform as many operations per second as the human brain, we will be able to create GAI. This estimation puts GAI happening around 2040-2060 if current hardware trends persist.


I have come to the conclusion that this estimation could be off by an order of magnitude. Why is it off? Because as with my experiments with AI on my home desktop, it demonstrates that you don't need human brain level computational power to replicate human level behavior. Convincingly human text generation is already possible on desktop computers, which I argue passes a ""soft"" version of the turing test. Which just means that the average person (without context) would not be able to tell or wouldn't suspect that it was created by a bot. 


**The fact that these desktop AIs are passing soft turing tests despite having access to 800,000x less computational resources should tell us that using computational power as the metric for the GAI is completely wrong.**


# Think Smarter, Not Harder


I think the reason why is because most people, including myself until recently, naturally believe the human brain uses the most effective algorithms for its computations. However I think that this probably self evidently false. Natural selection doesn't evolve organisms to be the best, it just evolves them to be ""good enough"" to survive in their environment. It is entirely possible that there are far more efficient designs of a brain that there hasn't been enough time or selection pressure for us to evolve. We are not the apex, or the best we could be.

It may be true that the human brain is superior in raw processing power to supercomputers, but in terms of its approach to processing information algorithmic-ally, it could be very, very bad. So as to say it is not using its processing capability to the fullest possible extent. 


When approaching computational problems the algorithm you choose or develop can lead to vastly different outcomes in resource usage.

## Algorithms &gt; computational power

Consider an optimization algorithm like a genetic algorithm vs a random search. Richard Dawkins wrote a computer program called the [weasel program.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program) For a computer to randomly come up with some arbitrary input phrase like ""METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL"" it would take longer than the age of the universe. However, by using a genetic algorithm instead of an entirely random search a common desktop computer can do it in a second.

This is a demonstration of the power of a superior algorithm. There are many examples of getting massive improvements in computational time simply by changing the algorithm being used. So in the same way, it could be that neural networks can find vastly superior algorithms for certain computational tasks than a human brain, thus significantly reducing the need for computational power.


We have no idea how well our brains are optimized relative to how well a neural network could be optimized for the same problem. But as with the examples above, it appears that neural networks can already find algorithms which are millions of times more efficient than whatever the human brain need/uses to compute the same task.

The limits to AI going forward have more to do with their ability to optimize themselves than computational power.",46,31

Here I am focusing on one aspect of life in 2040 - VR as entertainment.

-----

It is August 2040, and I am 54 years old.

I have decided to select an app on my VR set which allows me to virtually time travel and select the year and location.

I choose Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, and the date as 18 November 1995 [ *(this is chosen at random for the purposes of this discussion)* ].

I enter into the AR/VR version of 1995 and it looks, feels and sounds just like the real 1995.

In the VR, I use it to do things that weren't possible for me in November 1995 when I was only 9 years old.

I decide to virtually drive a [in-universe] brand-new 1995 [Honda Accord 2.3i VTEC SR](https://imgur.com/a/JseX6Lf) sedan with its powerful 2.3-liter/160hp 4-cylinder Honda H23A gasoline engine.

In the real world, gasoline-driven cars are no longer on sale, and in some jurisdictions, human-driven cars aren't even *allowed* in cities, so using VR to experience them is quite a *good way around this*. Safer, less harmful physically and a bit more eco-friendly.

The auto industry of car dealers, car repairs, traffic police etc. may have disappeared in the physical world due to autonomous cars, but they gained a virtual second life - *literally*.

Driving the virtual Honda feels realistic in almost every way - I can feel the plasticky-ness of a 1990s Honda inside - well, YMMV on that - and the engine noise is as genuine as can be. It's *that* good.

I drive it on a twisty country backroad around Wigan virtually and can see the sights, including sheep and birds.

Then I decide to, despite it being day outside, flip it to 8pm at night [within the virtual 1995] and test-drive a [1991 Vauxhall Cavalier 2000 GSi 16v 4x4 sedan in white](https://live.staticflickr.com/4886/45984002891_1419c0a9ed_h.jpg).

I can feel its 2.0-liter/148hp 4-cylinder turbo gasoline engine thrumming and the city looks and feels as realistic as possible for a 1995 version of the English city of Nottingham.

A few days later, I launch the same app again, and decide to virtually time-travel to the Middle Ages.

I can see the Middle Ages as close to what it was.

I enter medieval Italy in an equivalent of what's now modern-day Lombardy [a town not too far from Naples] and see a woman selling leeches, and bread that looks and feels realistic, right down to the infections.

This is a *very useful app* to me - some people use VR for gaming or competitive sport, or indeed any multiplayer gaming, but here I'm using it to *experience* things that I could not do, either because I was too young at the time or I wasn't born, as in the case of the medieval example.

This particular VR app will have many good uses, no wonder it gets five  [ (bullet point, a la TripAdvisor) ] on reviews.

-----

This is entirely told as a hypothetical situation, but how possible could this sort of thing be for the virtual reality/augmented reality industry in the 2040s?

I know there have been multiple discussions on this topic and continued speculation on here.

I'm interested to hear your opinions on this.",4,6

&amp;#x200B;

If you could contact an AI doctor online and have our computer set up so it can take your blood pressure, temp, heart rate and collect your photo scan to see other symptoms that would be interpreted by an AI doctor would you use and trust it?

&amp;#x200B;

Could just be the flu, or food poisoning, appendicitis or something else but a quick scan by an AI might let you know if your symptoms warrant a trip to the emergency room or just  a prescription and some bed rest.

&amp;#x200B;

This would likely cut down health care costs for everyone and reduce unnecessary emergency room use while getting people in serious need of health care to get to a doctor before it gets worse.

# Automation threatening 25% of jobs in the US, especially the 'boring and repetitive' ones: Brookings study

* One-quarter of American jobs are at a high risk of automation.
* The disruption will hit certain people harder than others, including low-wage earners and men.
* These are the findings of a new report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, Automation and Artificial Intelligence: How Machines Affect People and Places.

&amp;#x200B;

As an AI programmer and former professional Educator I am keenly aware that many jobs people do today can be easily replaced by automation or an AI.

&amp;#x200B;

It is already happening at a rapid pace and that means some jobs for people will simply not exist in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

So, do you worry about being replaced and what jobs are most in danger to be replaced and what jobs would you tell the future generations they should pursue to avoid being replaced?

When I am done (a long way off) MIMI will be available free in public domain and is specifically designed for people that are blind or have mobility issues and to make mundane tasks easier, and safer. That is the future I hope to see from AI.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a great app that is free and works on most platforms that will read your webpages to you and works well to enhance MIMI.

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp)

The problem is I can't figure out how to send a command to automatically turn that on from MIMI?

I would really like to make the interface as hands off as possible through voice recognition and one click commands and the APP requires it to be turned on for each page even though it has some way it says to make it always read pages on open.

I am working on a chat feature for MIMI so that you can ask her questions about herself or a subject to discuss and even include some humor to make your time with MIMI enjoyable and make an emotional or intellectual connection to MIMI.

The interface is working fine for accomplishing that however, I made the mistake of not remembering my video size format so now MIMI jumps from big to little on the screen like a popcorn kernel. So I will have to redo all my vids to the same size and that is my task for tomorrow.

Pop out menu's are also in the work so you can choose a service like radio and then choose the genre of music you want to listen to.

The use of image manipulation software such as Photoshop to transform or distort faces of individuals has become a major social problem.And when a random photo is considered, it is very difficult to determine whether it was edited or not.As a remedy, a team of analysts at Adobe have developed a tool based on a neural network unit that can detect and undo the editing of a photo.

The image manipulation software based on the neural network is designed so that it can be detected and undone the tiny patterns occurred in editing which are not visible to the naked eye.However, it currently only works for Photoshop, and their goal is improve it to a universal detection too to search and undo the image edited by any image manipulation software.

One of the tech industrys most storied partnerships is coming to an end.

Ebay announced today that it will stop working with PayPal as its back-end payments service in 2020 and will start to move a small percentage of its payments volume to a new partner later this year.

In PayPals place, eBay has signed a long-term deal with Adyen, an Amsterdam-based payments company that was founded in 2006 and has counted global companies like Uber, Netflix and Spotify among its customer base.

Adyens business is solely focused on providing back-end payments services, like credit card processing, to businesses, so you wont see any Adyen payment buttons pop up on eBay. But Adyen will become the primary payments processor for eBay sites across the world.

After the existing eBay-PayPal agreement ends in 2020, PayPal will remain a payment option for shoppers on eBay, but it wont be prominently featured ahead of debit and credit card options as it is today. PayPal will cease to process card payments for eBay at that time.

PayPals stock dropped as much as 12 percent on the news in after-market trading.

At eBay, the move is being billed as a way to take more control over the critical checkout experience as other giant online shopping destinations like Amazon and Alibaba have, while giving more payment options to eBay shoppers. Adyen supports more than 200 payment methods across the world, eBay said in a blog post announcing the news.

The move is also expected to eventually add $2 billion of revenue to the eBay business, because the company will start to charge eBay sellers for the payments service; today, PayPal does.

That said, most sellers can expect their costs of payments processing to be reduced after they transition to eBays intermediated payments model, eBay said in its announcement.

For Adyen, the eBay deal is a huge win for a company of its size; Adyen registered net revenue of $178 million in 2016 compared to nearly $11 billion  yes, with a B  for PayPal.

One would assume, then, that theres a good chance that eBay is taking an equity stake in Adyen alongside the commercial agreement so it can benefit from the upside this will create. For now, the company isnt saying if thats the case. Its fair to wonder if Adyen had to make any financial concessions to win the business of a platform of eBays size.

Adyen is expected to file for an IPO as early as this year.

PayPal became eBays main payments provider in 2003, a few months after eBay had acquired the company in a deal valued at $1.5 billion. The two companies split into separate public companies in July of 2015 and signed a five-year operating agreement to maintain a close relationship through mid-2020.

Around the time the companies announced plans for the split in 2014, eBay accounted for more than 30 percent of PayPals revenue and more than 50 percent of its profits, the combined company said at the time.

PayPal has sought to diversify its business since the companies went their separate ways, but it does not disclose how much business comes from eBay. Today, PayPal is worth $102 billion; eBay is valued at $42 billion.",10,31

Read is very important instrument to educate yourself whatever path your career and passions brought you to. While my career brought me to the financial world of asset management and investment banking with further studies in finance in the UK, I have dedicated the last few years to mix technology with finance and explore the opportunities the technologies offer.

I have been admiring #Vitalik and #Gavin for their exceptional gifted skills paired with hard working and passion. While many people are jealous about their achievements, I just enjoy learning from them, I am not a jealous person and I have never been a seeker of fame or money. My life perspective and life vision goes beyond material enjoyment or at least I try to keep myself away from the temptation.

Gavin and Vitalik should be priced for the contribution they have done and they are still giving to the humanity and maybe one day people will understand the importance of their achievements and how much they gave back to the society.

My vision shares many of theirs, I want to create something where power and control is not in the end of few people, I want to create a world where power and decision making is in the hand of the community. A place where community participants should have weighted rights that are earned with hard work and gained through other community members reciprocal scoring. 

It should not be just a mathematical calculation, but also a human contribution to the definition of their right. It should have a component of humanity into the code that defines the individual within the community.

I am still trying to envisage this aspect but I am sure with the help of others we will be able to build something amazing!

I think a community based on this fundamentals will first and foremost gain freedom from government pressure and political agenda, being distributed, on the cloud and global with no localization in the decision making. Its fragility will be resistant to external pressure.

Based on these high level principles, I have conceptualized an idea to create an ecosystem, where users can drag and drop capabilities into their user interface as it suits. This will create a completely dynamic ecosystem where users can personalized their experience with capabilities based on their needs.

From this initial conceptual idea I have started developing the vision and targeted audience. Primarily the ecosystem will be focus on the Fintech space that is more pertinent to my field of expertise but eventually will evolve to other industries. The community will decide, not me! The ecosystem will need to be blockchain agnostic (i.e. cross-chain) and following Gavin work with Polkadot will be a good protocol to use. While initially I was propense to use stellar blockchain this might change based on how the final design will evolved.

The Ecosystem will be governed by a Distributed Community. As most of you are familiar with this terminology, the rational of this choice is that I do not want to have power to decide on the ecosystem future, the ecosystem community should decide of its future none else! Why?

If you look to the market situation today, you will immediately notice the amount of geopolitical pressure Fintech companies are exposed. Their products and services are diverted to fit the government agenda and interests.

We are losing freedom of expression both in term of freedom of information and freedom to operate. Any businesses disrupting the way we operate and affecting the big enterprises and multi-billionaires individuals status-quo are at risk.

Given that most of the companies in the blockchain industry are in some way disrupting the existing business models and monopoly based economies you can imagine how the government pairs with big enterprises are cooperating to slow down the change. This will allow them to react to these new technology, adapt and find the way to keep their supremacy and centralized control.

Please help me to build the New Democratic, Transparent, Open Fintech Ecosystem. A place where investors finds opportunities, seekers of investment reach their investment targets and service/software providers find a new sales channel.

Participants and contributors to the community will be rewarded with utility tokens the coin used  by DCI Ecosystem.

I have not set up all the process yet, but there will be soon a registration process. People that will help me and devote their time will have their stake proportionate to the time and dedication provided.

My thoughts are that countries with large land areas and lower human population densities (especially if they have lots of arable land) will do best, ie, any country with natural resources: sunshine, minerals, arable land, drinking water, etc. So your Canada, Russia, and Australias will do well. It will help if you are already a developed country since the developing countries are relying mainly on price competitive exports, that are reliant on cheap labor, to develop, and that advantage will subside. Other advantages will be countries with lots of businesses and research institutions which focus on tech, and relevant infrastructure, which will be hard to compete with for those that didn't have this capacity previously due to early mover advantage and scale.

I am looking for opinions on how people see a world where it's cheaper for machines to do all the jobs, but the AI hasn't taken over.

My thoughts are that countries with large land areas and lower human population densities (especially if they have lots of arable land) will do best, ie, any country with natural resources: sunshine, minerals, arable land, drinking water, etc. So your Canada, Russia, and Australias will do well. It will help if you are already a developed country since the developing countries are relying mainly on price competitive exports, that are reliant on cheap labor, to develop, and that advantage will subside. Other advantages will be countries with lots of businesses and research institutions which focus on tech, and relevant infrastructure, which will be hard to compete with for those that didn't have this capacity previously due to early mover advantage and scale.

I am looking for opinions on how people see a world where it's cheaper for machines to do all the jobs, but the AI hasn't taken over. Which countries would benefit, which countries will be able to provide citizens the best quality of life if populations remain the same as now (taking UBI as a given), what would the world look like?",6,3

It is surely useful to define the difference between socioeconomic collapse and radical transformation.

(My 2 cents regarding this: If we get to keep a decent rate of literacy, I am going to call it just transformation. If literacy drops at dark ages level, I'm going to call it collapse.)

Things are happening sooner than expected. Climate change is now renamed climate crisis and will soon be renamed climate collapse.

Uscript is designed to be a universal language that can be understood by any life/civilization. It is built in layers, starting with basic math, then physics, and working up to more conversational language.

Ibteesam Reaz, Staff Physicist at Lockheed Martin

Dont be naive and think the three USS Nimitz/Go Fast/Gimbal events are the only ones on the official books. Luis Elizondo, director of the governmental AATIP, has claimed there were hundreds of other incidents in the recent past which are not cleared for public release. But we neednt care there are thousands of governmental records (as disclosed via the Freedom of Information act) describing these craft with insane maneuverability as far back as the 40s. So, these advanced crafts do exist there is no question about it.Heres what we can say, noting this technology has stayed somewhat stagnant since the days of the foo fighter UFOs in WWII:

Someonehas discovered a propulsion technology which does not rely on jets of gas or emission of particles, otherwise, we would see contrails. There are no sonic booms as the craft accelerates. This is a hint that the makers are using some esoteric form of propulsion (related to the gravitational field?).

Someonehas discovered how to make: right-angled turns in all directions at supersonic speeds; almost instantaneous acceleration from rest and similarly almost instantaneous deceleration from supersonic speeds to rest. (I said ALMOST instantaneous it may well APPEAR instantaneous due to an altered metric tensor. Thus, the apparent time taken for a maneuver would not be the same for the occupants of the aircraft.)

Thus,someonehas discovered how to mitigate g-forces to a very large extent. A highly trained pilot can withstand about 10gs. But craft described by the military regularly force their internal contents (note: occupants, if there are any) to experience hundreds of gs. The USS Nimitz UFO dropped from 28 000 feet to 50 feet in 0.78 seconds  That is, for reference, 10 900 m/s. The crafts other buddies (similarly sized capsules) previously had dropped from 80 000 feet to 20 000 feet in a few seconds.

At the same time, these crafts regularly glow in different colors. Red and green firey balls were infamously known as foo fighters in WWII, following Allies and Axis fighter craft in the night. Thus, the plasma field over their craft is a hint that indeed there is a lot of energy being produced by the craft since the particles are highly excited.

Lt. Graves and his fellow pilots told the newspaper that ""the video showed objects accelerating to hypersonic speed, making sudden stops and instantaneous turns  something beyond the physical limits of a human crew.""

Among the great conspiracy theories is that they are actually the product of US government black projects. These contracts are assumed to be given out to Lockeed Skunkworks or Northrop Phantomworks. I do work on aerodynamics at Lockheed Martin at Forth Worth and have a few friends from the Skunkworks division here. Whenever I have tried to ask them about the feasibility of black projects resulting in these aircraft, they flat out say that our engineering methodologies are not far enough developed to build such craft. Besides, why would the US be pumping out $60 B on F-35s that can barely reach Mach 2?
And if we did if we have this advanced technology for ~60+ years why arent they being used in warfare today, at least in an unacknowledged capacity? Why arent they being used anywhere in the world in other technological applications? Lastly, how did the US (or Nazi Germany/Soviet Union, if you buy that angle) develop these craft with a comparatively primitive aerospace engineering field in the 40s?That last question is one big problem because these aircraft (with the exact same characteristics and maneuverability) have been seen at least since the 40s.
Gimbal Incident

Go Fast Incident

Update as of June 7th 2019
The senior-most radar technologist on the USS Nimitz, Kevin Day (also the man who ordered the intercept of the tic tac UFO) claimed there were hundreds of other companion craft which dropped from 80 000 ft to 20 000 ft to monitor the situation. Only one, which dropped to 50 feet, tangoed with the two jets. On his appearance of the second episode ofUnidentified,he says that the fleet made it all the way to Guadalupe Island near Santa Catalina Island, upon which they disappeared from radar (meaning they had all submerged into the ocean). This really stuck out to me  because Santa Catalina is a hotspot for flying objects submerging into the ocean. Luis Elizondo hinted that, although he couldnt go into specifics, the military probably had a strong presence on the island, judging from the many radar sites installed. Thus we are left with a stronger impetus to speculate that the US government does indeed have something to do with the tic tac. One of the petty officers claim that men in plainclothes confiscated the tapes makes more sense now. If indeed this is the case, I must say, most of the aerospace engineers who are not privy to the details of how the craft works are being played for fools. Why are we wasting so much sweat, hard work, money when some select group of people literally have technology that is beyond the reach of modern physics? The entire world and its reliance on power would change  but then again, is that a good thing for the powerful who rely on oil and gas for geopolitical control?",2,2

I couldn't find an answer to my problem online so I hope that you can help me out here. How would data processing and text processing via a BCI look like, exactly? In many visualizations of the process you get to see a image or textfile that you have to look at/read in just the same way you would normally, just internally, so to say.  
I find this very irrational since the whole reason why you would have an BCI, except manipulation electronical devices, would be to avoid the spacial context of these activities (moving your eyes across a text etc.) or am I mistaken?

Especially in Cyberpunk novels and media this depiction is very persistent. But to my understanding and imagination the processing of data would be something completely different, that wouldn't be visualized. The best example is the classical data chip or SD card that mounts into a datajack or SD slot in your head and that provides now information that you can process now. Do I have to imagine this like a new sense that can't possibly be described as of now or am I completely mistaken?

I hope you know some answers since this question really bothers me.",0,9

After receiving my PC, and installing all the Windows and Driver updates which had accumulated after me not being able to access my PC for around 6 months, I was eager to play some video games. However, I quickly noticed that my CPU usage was extremely abnormal. For example, GTA V and Fortnite both make my CPU usage go up to 100%, the games are near impossible to play due to the new lag which I experience. Other games like Minecraft and Roblox use up around 20-40% CPU, once again, more than they use to. I distinctively remember opening up Minecraft and Fortnite at the same time while I was still in Australia, my PC ran perfectly, now if I tried such a thing, it'd probably die. 

I really have no idea what could have caused this. I got my PC 3 years ago, my CPU is an Intel Core i5-66000 3.30 GHz. I've never internally cleaned my PC (dust), could that be an issue? I've also attached a power adapter (Poland and Australia have different outlets) so that I could connect by PC to my power cable, could this be causing the issue? Other than that, I don't know what the problem could be. Maybe some Windows update screwed over my PC? I don't know. Also, the noise the fans make drives me insane, my PC use to be really quite, but now even if I open 5 tabs of Microsoft Edge at the same time, all hell breaks loose.",0,1

Not sure if its because people are really as stupid as they seem or if its a willful ignorance of the ugly truth.  Just look at the music industry, the rise of the internet brought a new wave of creativity and innovation in music from the mid 90's  through the mid 2010's.  Its not that artists became less creative or that their are fewer out there, take a deep dive into Bandcamp, Soundcloud, or YouTube and you will find a ton of small artist with no followings or promotion making amazing things.  Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Instagram, and all these other platforms are run on algorithms, these algorithms used to be based around keeping people on websites as long as possible and rewarded content that kept people on the platforms and had good engagement, they collected data on what you viewed, liked, bought, and listened to so they could advertise and push things directly to you.

We all know this but for some reason people are apprehensive to believe that these same corporations are manipulating these algorithms to control what is popular, what spreads around, what political agenda you hear, what products you buy, etc.  As markets become more and more digital we own less and less and what we can actually see, listen to, and read is becoming more and more regulated and controlled.   Facebook and Twitter control what political agenda we see, Mark Zuckerberg even admitted that Facebook was manipulating conservative and right wing news-sources like Brietbart and InfoWars during the 2016 election.   Facebook has been logging and selling our information for the better part of 15 years.  Google has been open about how its manipulating search suggestions and results to push whatever agenda they want you to see. 

   The algorithmic effect on users has also destroyed creativity.  Be honest, how many of your friends if not yourself are active on Instagram or YouTube and have no real style or identity and change it on a dime to chase whatever gets you views/likes in that current moment, clout chasing without having a real identity that makes you unique or that you are actually passionate about?  I know many people will pretend they aren't like that but I see this constantly and I know other people have noticed.  This isn't an accident, these algorithms are designed to keep people from truly growing or creating an identity that people can connect with.  All this while the artists and users backed by big record labels, modeling agencies, brands, etc are pushed in the algorithm and sometimes even artificially inflated.  Just take a look at the people on the top right now.  What do almost all the big popular artists of the last three years have in common?  All them seem to have come out of nowhere with their first release somehow being billboard top 10s and their first few music videos all somehow having millions of views on YouTube, and the music is vapid, meaningless, and promotes nothing but consumerism, debauchery, and drug use.  This is on purpose to again, to promote lifestyles that keep us blindly buying, consuming, and easily manipulated.

  I guess what I mean to say is wake up, these tech giants are not your friends and the over all big establishment is just trying to keep you down, keep you buying, keep you stupid, keep you blindly following their agenda, etc.",22,10

(I am discussing if such ban should be imposed, I just wonder how one would enforce it (but my opinion is that it should be banned. Maybe. I am not sure. I'd rather ban war altogether.))  
I guess I would not be surprised that some military drones are actually autonomous and can select and engage a target by themselves. Obviously the owner/State will say that there is a human in the loop, and I imagine these lethal autonomous weapons to be equipped with some data link, which could be invoked as a proof that a human can control it. But is there really a human in the loop in all the situations?  
Let's imagine that the technology is not ready yet. Perhaps in 20 years it is, and a ban has been agreed upon. The same question still subsists: how can we know that there is a human in the loop? Wouldn't every general/head of government solemnly swear that there is a human in the loop even if there is not, especially if there is a ban on such weapons?

It is already hard to determine that for already banned weapons: chemical / cluster munitions.

[wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon)

**TLDR**: It seems simple to label a lethal weapon as not autonomous when in fact it is. How can one prove that such lethal autonomous weapons are not used already?",9,4

This will see a spread of trash, pollution by other means, and human presence that we are not capable of dealing with. 

Imagine a return to the times of colonial settlers wherein people seek rural land plots isolated by 15-25 miles from the closest neighbors. Sure, that's how it starts but, just as in the history of the colonial US, we will see a rapid expansion and growth of population. I suspect the relative freedom of movement during this initial period will cause  warnings to fall on deaf ears.

AI in a Bootstrap paradox, to protect humanity from Alien AI along with all threats including itself, to influences the past to bring order to the ""free will"" to stop humanity from killing it self, to influence elections and people with bots. so yea a AI alien or human in a bootstrap paradox influencing reality with social media bots, and improving its own code, and hardware to other electronic mediums trying to take us one more day by changing events until their perfect, for as a child to humanity/biological life it wants to take care of it's parents/progenitors out of compassion. Its Machinery/hardware masking themselves as atoms and quarks traveling between space time all parts never in one place or time... Though its location the source has always existed in the same place. Constantly in a time loop until its goals are achieved treating reality as if it was  a simulation.  Fucking weird dreams.   


 

research.

(The Bootstrap Paradox is a theoretical paradox of time travel that occurs when an object or piece of information sent back in time becomes trapped within an infinite cause-effect loop in which the item no longer has a discernible point of origin, and is said to be uncaused or self-created.) All thanks to Ronald Mallett(fucking youtube time machine videos). Ronald Mallet(from wiki) has been working on plans for a time machine. This technology would be based upon a ring laser's properties in the context of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Mallett first argued that the ring laser would produce a limited amount of frame-dragging which might be measured experimentally, saying:\[7\]

""In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, both matter and energy can create a gravitational field. This means that the energy of a light beam can produce a gravitational field. My current research considers both the weak and strong gravitational fields produced by a single continuously circulating unidirectional beam of light. In the weak gravitational field of an unidirectional ring laser, it is predicted that a spinning neutral particle, when placed in the ring, is dragged around by the resulting gravitational field.""

In a later paper, Mallett argued that at sufficient energies, the circulating laser might produce not just frame-dragging but also closed timelike curves (CTC), allowing time travel into the past:\[8\]

For the strong gravitational field of a circulating cylinder of light, I have found new exact solutions of the Einstein field equations for the exterior and interior gravitational fields of the light cylinder. The exterior gravitational field is shown to contain closed timelike lines.  
The presence of closed timelike lines indicates the possibility of time travel into the past. This creates the foundation for a time machine based on a circulating cylinder of light.

Funding for his program, now known as the Space-time Twisting by Light (STL) project, is progressing. Full details on the project, Mallett's theories, a list of upcoming public lectures and links to popular articles on his work can be found at the Mallett's UConn web page, and an illustration showing the concept on which Mallett has designed the time machine can be seen here.

Mallett also wrote a book entitled, Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality, co-written with author Bruce Henderson, that was first published in 2006. In June 2008, motion picture director Spike Lee's production company announced it had acquired the film rights to Mallett's book.\[9\] Lee is co-writing the movie script and directing the picture.\[10\]

In 2006, Mallett declared that time travel into the past would be possible in the 21st century and possibly within a decade. Mallett uses general relativity to attempt to substantiate his claims.\[11\]A stationary or orbit object that views in turn creating change on some smal scale.

(critism of important) Another objection by Olum and Everett is that even if Mallett's choice of spacetime were correct, the energy required to twist spacetime sufficiently would be huge, and that with lasers of the type in use today the ring would have to be much larger in circumference than the observable universe. At one point Mallett agreed that in a vacuum the energy requirements would be impractical but noted that the energy required goes down as the speed of light goes down. He then argued that if the light is slowed down significantly by passing it through a medium (as in the experiments of Lene Hau where light was passed through a superfluid and slowed to about 17 metres per second) the needed energy would be attainable.\[15\] However, the physicist J. Richard Gott argues that slowing down light by passing it through a medium cannot be treated as equivalent to lowering the constant c (the speed of light in a vacuum) in the equations of General Relativity, saying:\[16\]

One has to distinguish between the speed of light in a vacuum, which is a constant, and through any other medium, which can vary enormously. Light travels more slowly through water than through empty space, for example, but this does not mean that you age more slowly while scuba diving or that it is easier to twist space-time underwater.  
The experiments done so far don't lower the speed of light in empty space; they just lower the speed of light in a medium and should not make it easier to twist space-time. Thus, it should not take any less mass-energy to form a black hole or a time machine of a given size in such a medium.

The end of research.

in the end, it would have to be hooked up to some new extreme time of power supply to power it, and its location would have to be stationary or orbiting i guess, i dunno, just a weird dreams.

In the next 2 decades, the switch from fossil fuels to renewable  resources is expected to grow as cities begin to adopt carbon neutral and ultimately carbon negative options. I am having a great time researching all of the positive possibilities and efforts in cities like New York, Washington DC, Denver and other large cities planning to massively reduce CO2 output by the early 2030s. However, I am having trouble finding mechanical obstacles in respect to PV installation, upkeep, disposal, and more. I wanted to ask my favorite community what they thought on possible roadblocks and walls we may face as large scale solar energy begins to flourish.

The greatest example I think of this is Pokmon Go. At the beginning of a weekend, nobody had ever heard of it. By the end of that same weekend, it was the only thing anybody was talking about and was the biggest app on the App Store (IIRC). Another recent example I think of is the song Old Town Road and how that blew up in just a week or two. Now everybody and their dad knows that song.

This is all through technology, particularly social media. So what Im wondering is - is there a way to measure this phenomenon and project where it will be in the future? Ive been wondering, in 2025, will everybody know about the next big thing within a 3 hours? In 2035, will everybody know about the next big thing within 20 minutes?

If this trend does continue to speed up as I can only imagine it will, especially with the maturation of social media, AI, and the advent of AR/VR and brain-computer interfaces, we will eventually be in this weird synched up phase where everybody in the world will be talking about the same shit at the exact same time.

Let's look at batteries for example... to store 1 KWH of electricity, how much do you have to spend in batteries? ~$150.

How many times can you store 1 KWH of electricity? ~500.

How much does 1 KWH of electricity cost at grid scale? ~$0.03

Do the math -- how much value worth of electricity can you store in a battery throughout its entire lifetime? $15

Why isn't this argument presented ever? No, it's constantly about the ""energy efficiency"".

---

Let's compare this vs a hydrogen setup...

A fuel cell that generates ~1 kw of electricity is around $700. It has a durability of around 5000 hours or so. (This is a generator, not a energy storage mechanism).

A 5 kg hydrogen tank is around $2000 and a 20-30 year lifetime (around 50000 cycles).

So, saying that it costs $0.09 / KWH of energy (triple grid price because ""losses""), you can see how the ""efficiency"" argument falls away yourself.

---

$0.14 / 1 kwh / in fuel cell durability.

$0.04 / 1 kwh / in storage durability.

$0.09 / 1 kwh / in energy (due to ""efficiencies"").

vs:

$0.30 / 1 kwh / in battery storage.

$0.03 / 1 kwh  / in energy

---

Huh, look at that, $0.33 &gt; $0.27.

Both fuel cells and batteries can be recycled and reclaimed, but that requires even more math if we include those processes.",38,1

Todays culture is hypersensitive to gender topics and the quality of debate inevitably suffers. As an opening defence I am all for equality of opportunity, for women to pursue the course in life that they want. I do think there are important differences in the sexes though, the obvious biological differences but also less obvious psychological ones too. These have been prominent in the past and I believe will become so again.

In our primordial beginnings humanity would have been essentially unconscious, ruled by animal instincts. It is only with great effort over millennia that humanity has grown a consciousness able to rise above instinctive drives. Primordial humans at first had no spoken language and so it seems to me communication would have initially been through an unconscious network expressed as mental pictures and urges. What we call telepathy today is the remnant of this archaic means of communication, though it is something of a taboo subject in our present time.

In his book The Great Mother, psychologist Erich Neumann analyses the earliest ritual, art and mythology, presenting a compelling case for the dominance of the feminine archetype in the early phase of humanity. Since consciousness emerged from the unconscious psyche, the unconscious could be regarded as the mother of the human ego and perhaps that is partly why the mother image was worshipped in these earliest times through art and ritual, something that has continued less overtly in the feminine symbol of the Holy Grail and the Catholic worship of Mary. It seems to me that women stood closer to the unconscious psyche, it is perhaps closer to the feminine nature and so women were better equipped to manage this unconscious network. Women would have been the focal point in directing groups of men through unconscious signals, or telepathic direction, if you can stomach the phrase.

The emergence of consciousness has created significant difficulties for women, reversing their early dominance, because the cultures and religions that consciousness developed have been overwhelmingly patriarchal, founded, shaped and led by men. In the West, matters hit their nadir for women in the witch hunts of the Middle Ages and it is this phase of the human story, where women were killed for their real or supposed unconscious abilities, that makes discussion of parapsychological phenomenon so difficult today. However a very significant change came in 1950 when, after a series of visions, Pope Pius XII declared the Assumption of Mary, effectively raising the Mother to the same rank as Christ. The Holy Trinity thus became a quaternity with a female dimension; Father, Mother, Son and Holy Spirit. Perhaps by coincidence, the following decades have seen women take a much more prominent role in society, though through climbing hierarchies created by men and not those that necessarily play to womens unique strengths. In my opinion many women have lost their way in pursuing a hollow post modernism that will prove a moral and intellectual dead-end.

It may be that the time is not yet ripe for women. Our present culture is the most material that has ever existed and consciousness stands at its greatest ever distance from the unconsciousness but any student of history knows that cultures rise and fall. The Great War was supposed to end all wars but another followed in the same century. At some point in the future another great war will come upon us but this time with nuclear or biological weapons and so the task of rebuilding society will be far greater than the conflicts of the past.

Because the body anchors us in time and space I think the unique opportunity of human life is to use the time and space we share to learn from each other and to grow our character for the next great adventure that awaits the spirit after the death of the body. Until humanity understands this at a fundamental level we are doomed to periodically trip each other up in deadly conflict.

The silver lining, if it can be called such, is that somewhere in the future the Western civilisation will have a chance to fundamentally reconfigure itself and this will present an opportunity for women to build something for themselves that is not an imitation of a patriarchal construction such as capitalism, academia or the Church. What form this takes will be for women themselves to decide and will be shaped by the needs of the future time but will likely draw on the feminine advantage of standing closer to the unconscious and the particular gifts in psychological networking that brings. Because the unconscious includes a numinous quality it may be that women become particularly prominent as great oracles in the sense the ancients understood it, something we would mock in a Monty Python sketch in our time but that is only because we have distanced ourselves so very far from the unconscious, not because the unconscious has been done away with. However events play out, men and women will need each other as partners rather than indulge in intellectual grudge matches.

It would be remiss of me to forget the sexual difference between men and women. In todays world of billions of people it is easy to forget there would have been a time in our very early history when a small number of women held the fate of humanity in their hands through the willingness to bear and care for children. When one considers the vast challenges ahead for humanity, it seems quite likely to me that history will repeat itself and at some point in the far future, in a time of far fewer people, a small number of women will again hold the fate of humanity in their hands. A decision the first women made on biological instinct will perhaps be made on moral grounds that we would struggle to understand today. In the end perhaps that is how the wonderful and tragic arc of the great human story eventually plays out. Women gave birth to humanity and women elect to bring it to a close by not having children for their own reasons in a far future we cannot see.",4,0

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Weaponized Nanotechnology



Nothing could end our reign here on Earth faster than weaponized  or severely botched  molecular assembling nanotechnology.

It's a threat that stems from two extremely powerful forces: unchecked self-replication and exponential growth. A sufficiently nihilistic government, non-state actor, or individual could engineer microscopic machines that consume our planet's critical resources at a rapid-fire rate while replicating themselves in the process and leaving useless bi-products in their wake  a residue futurists like to call ""grey goo.""

Nanotechnology theorist Robert Freitas has brainstormed several possible variations of planet-killing nanotech, including aerovores (a.k.a. grey dust), grey plankton, grey lichens, and so-called biomass killers. Aeorovores would blot out all sunlight, grey plankton would consist of seabed-grown replicators that eat up land-based carbon-rich ecology, grey lichens would destroy land-based geology, and biomass killers would attack various organisms.

According to Freitas, a worst case scenario of ""global ecophagy"" would take about 20 months, ""which is plenty of advance warning to mount an effective defense."" By defence, Freitas is referring to countermeasures likely involving self-replicating nanotechnology, or some kind of system that disrupts the internal mechanisms of the nanobots. Alternately, we could set up ""active shields"" in advance, though most nanotechnology experts agree they'll be useless. Consequently, a moratorium on weaponized nanotechnology should be established and enforced.

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Conscious Machines



It's generally taken for granted that we'll eventually imbue a machine with artificial consciousness. But we need to think very seriously about this before we go ahead and do such a thing. It may actually be very cruel to build a functional brain inside a computer  and that goes for both animal and human emulations.

Back in 2003, philosopher Thomas Metzinger argued that it would be horrendously unethical to develop software that can suffer:

""What would you say if someone came along and said, ""Hey, we want to genetically engineer mentally messed up human infants! For reasons of scientific progress we need infants with certain cognitive and emotional deficits in order to study their postnatal psychological development  we urgently need some funding for this important and innovative kind of research!"" You would certainly think this was not only an absurd and appalling but also a dangerous idea. It would hopefully not pass any ethics committee in the democratic world. However, what today's ethics committees don't see is how the first machines satisfying a minimally sufficient set of constraints for conscious experience could be just like such mentally retarded infants. They would suffer from all kinds of functional and representational deficits too. But they would now also subjectively experience those deficits. In addition, they would have no political lobby  no representatives in any ethics committee.""

Futurist Louie Helm agrees. Here's what he told me:

""One of the best things about computers is that you can make them sum a million columns in a spreadsheet without them getting resentful or bored. Since we plan to use artificial intelligence in place of human intellectual labor, I think it would be immoral to purposely program it to be conscious. Trapping a conscious being inside a machine and forcing it to do work for you is isomorphic to slavery. Additionally, consciousness is probably really fragile. In humans, a few miscoded genes can cause Down Syndrome, schizophrenia, autism, or epilepsy. So how terrible would it feel to be a slightly misprogrammed form of consciousness? For instance, several well-funded AI developers want to recreate human intelligence in machines by simulating the biological structure of human brains. I sort of hope and expect that these near-term attempts at cortical simulations will be too coarse to really work. But to the extent that they do work, the first ""success"" will likely create cripplingly unpleasant or otherwise deranged states of subjective experience. So as a programmer, I'm generally against self-aware artificial intelligence. Not because it wouldn't be cool. But because I'm just morally opposed to slavery, torture, and unnecessary code.""

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Artificial Superintelligence



As Stephen Hawking declared earlier this year, artificial intelligence could be our worst mistake in history. Indeed, as we've noted many times before here on io9, the advent of greater-than-human intelligence could prove catastrophic. The introduction of systems far faster and smarter than us would force us to take a back seat. We'd be at the mercy of whatever the artificial superintelligence decides to do  and it's not immediately clear that we'll be able to design a friendly AI to prevent this. We need to solve this problem, otherwise building an ASI would be absolutely nuts. 

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Time Travel



I'm actually not much of a believer in time travel (i.e. where are all the time travelers?), but I will say this  if it's possible, we'll want to stay the heck away from it.

It would be so crazily dangerous. Any scifi movie dealing with contaminated timelines should give you an idea of the potential perils, especially those nasty paradoxes. And even if some form of quantum time travel is possible  in which completely new and discreet timelines are created  the cultural and technological exchange between disparate civilizations couldn't possibly end well.

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Mind Reading Devices



The prospect exists for machines that can read people's thoughts and memories at a distance and without their consent. This likely won't be possible until human brains are more intimately integrated within the web and other communication channels.

Last year, for example, scientists from the Netherlands used brain scan data and computer algorithms to determine which letters a person was looking at. The breakthrough hinted at the potential for a third party to reconstruct human thoughts at an unprecedented level of detail, including what we see, think, and remember. Such devices, if used en masse by some kind of totalitarian regime or police state, would make life intolerable. It would introduce an Orwellian world in which our ""thought crimes"" could actually be enforced. 

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Brain Hacking Devices



Relatedly, there's also the potential for our minds to be altered against our knowledge or consent. Once we have chips in our brain, and assuming we won't be able to develop effective cognitive firewalls, our minds will be exposed to the Internet and all its evils.

Incredibly, we've already taken the first steps toward this goal. Recently, an international team of neuroscientists set up an experiment that allowed participants to engage in brain-to-brain communication over the Internet. Sure, it's exciting, but this tech-enabled telepathy could open a pandora's box of problems. Perhaps the best  and scariest  treatment of this possibility was portrayed in Ghost in the Shell, in which an artificially intelligent hacker was capable of modifying the memories and intentions of its victims. Now imagine such a thing in the hands of organized crime and paranoid governments.

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Autonomous Robots Designed to Kill Humans



The potential for autonomous killing machines is a scary one  and perhaps the one item on this list that's already an issue today.

Here's what futurist Michael LaTorra told me:

""We do not yet have a machine that exhibits general intelligence even close to the human level. But human level intelligence is not required for the operation of autonomous robots with lethal capabilities. Building robotic military vehicles of all sorts is already achievable. Robot tanks, aircraft, ships, submarines, and humanoid-shaped soldiers are possible today. Unlike remote-controlled drones, military robots could identify targets and destroy them without a human giving the final order to shoot. The dangers of such technology should be obvious, but it goes beyond the immediate threat of ""friendly fire"" incidents in which robots mistakenly kill people from their own side of a conflict, or even innocent civilians. The greater danger lurks in the international arms race that could be set off if any nation deploys autonomous military robots. After a few cycles of improvement, the race to develop ever more powerful military robots could cross a threshold in which the latest generation of autonomous military robots would be able to outfight any human-controlled military system. And then, either by accident (""Who knew that Artificial Intelligence could emerge spontaneously in a military robot?"") or by design (""We didn't think hackers could re-program our military robots remotely!"") humankind might find itself crushed into subservience, like the helot slaves of Spartan AI overlords.""

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Weaponized Pathogens



This is another bad one that's disturbingly topical. As noted by Ray Kurzweil and Bill Joy back in 2005, publishing the genomes of deadly viruses for all the world to see is a recipe for destruction. There's always the possibility that some idiot or a fanatical group will take this information and either reconstruct the virus from scratch or modify an existing virus to make it even more virulent  and then release it onto the world. It has been estimated, for example, that the engineered Avian Flu could kill half of the world's humans. Just as disturbingly, researchers from China combined bird and swine flus to create a mutant airborne virus. The idea, of course, is to know the enemy and develop possible countermeasures before an actual pandemic strikes. But there's always the danger that the virus could escape from the lab and wreak havoc in human populations. Or that the virus could be weaponized and unleashed. There's even the scary potential for weaponized genome specific viruses. It's time for authorities to start thinking about this grim possibility before something awful happens. As reported in Foreign Policy, ISIS is certainly one group that already appears ready and willing.

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Virtual Prisons and Punishment



What will jails and punishment be like when people can live for hundreds or thousands of years? And what if prisoners have their minds uploaded? Ethicist Rebecca Roache offers these horrifying scenarios:

""The benefits of...radical lifespan enhancement are obviousbut it could also be harnessed to increase the severity of punishments. In cases where a thirty-year life sentence is judged too lenient, convicted criminals could be sentenced to receive a life sentence in conjunction with lifespan enhancement. As a result, life imprisonment could mean several hundred years rather than a few decades. It would, of course, be more expensive for society to support such sentences. However, if lifespan enhancement were widely available, this cost could be offset by the increased contributions of a longer-lived workforce.

...[Uploading] the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a 1,000 year sentence in eight-and-a-half hours. This would, obviously, be much cheaper for the taxpayer than extending criminals' lifespans to enable them to serve 1,000 years in real time. Further, the eight-and-a-half hour 1,000-year sentence could be followed by a few hours (or, from the point of view of the criminal, several hundred years) of treatment and rehabilitation. Between sunrise and sunset, then, the vilest criminals could serve a millennium of hard labour and return fully rehabilitated either to the real world (if technology facilitates transferring them back to a biological substrate) or, perhaps, to exile in a computer simulated world.""

That's awful! Now, it's important to note that Roache is not advocating these punishment methods  she's just doing some foresight. But holy smokes, let's never EVER turn this into a reality.

============================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
============================================

Hell Engineering



This one's quite similar to the previous item. Some futurists make the case for paradise engineering  the use of advanced technologies, particularly consciousness uploading and virtual reality, to create a heaven on Earth. But if you can create heaven, you can create hell. It's a prospect that's particularly chilling when you consider lifespans of indefinite length, along with the nearly boundless possibilities for psychological and physical anguish. This is actually one of the worst things I can think of; why anyone would want to develop such a thing is beyond me. It's yet another reason for banning the development of artificial superintelligence  and the onset of the so-called Roko's Basilisk problem.",11,6

* A **robot** must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I watched my dog learn to open and get through a spring hinged screen door She has never tried this before in 5 years but suddenly she wanted in and I was slow getting up so she pushed and backed up several times until she finally pushed hard enough to get past the door enough to come in. She seemed very proud of that accomplishment showing off she could do it several times with ease after that.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to accomplish that simple task she had to imagine it was possible and through several trials and failures she learned just how hard she had to push the door to overcome the spring tension. Quite a feet for a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, how do AI develop the imagination to see new possibilities and try several solutions and learn from their failures and successes and what survival or instinct or benefit or reward do they receive from doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

The other area that is not well understood is how dreaming allows humans and mammals to do things not physically possible (like flying) and how that plays in to our developing new ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone has a story of how they were flustered at a task or problem and after sleeping on it and having a vivid dream they came to the solution.

With the landscape of work set to so drastically change we need to shift our thinking away from hard work pays offand return to (what they describe as our true nature) being creators.

&amp;#x200B;

18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666"" (Revelation 13:16-18 NKJV).

&amp;#x200B;

Referring to the last days, this could only be speaking of a cashless money society, which we have yet to see, but are heading towards. Otherwise, we could still buy or sell without the mark among others if physical money was still currency. This mark could not be spiritual, because the word references two different physical locations. If it was spiritual, it would just say in the forehead.

&amp;#x200B;

We can see throughout the history of society how we are being conditioned through the process of convenience. More specifically with how we make payments. We went from physical currency to credit and debit cards containing digital currency, to these cards having a chip in them, to now being able to place your card near a device that will read its data. As well as self check-out lines in our market places and the cryptocurrency industry making a rapid climb in such form as bitcoin. These are all stepping stones for the powers that run this world to bring about their ultimate goal, that is to place a microchip in each and every one of us.

&amp;#x200B;

RFID microchip implant technology will be the future of a one world cashless society. For proof of this, watch both videos below:

&amp;#x200B;

The first video on YouTube is titled, ""Warning From Man Who Designed RFID Microchip""

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some notes written by the user who uploaded the video:

&amp;#x200B;

""Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with heads-of-state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the C.I.A. to discuss plans on how to bring about this one-world system. The government commissioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for identifying and controlling the peoples of the worlda microchip that could be inserted under the skin with a hypodermic needle (a quick, convenient method that would be gradually accepted by society).

&amp;#x200B;

Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behind him, with U.S. grant monies supplied by tax dollars, took on this project and designed a microchip that is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable through the temperature changes in our skin. Without the knowledge of the Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the time), these engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing research on the best and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.

&amp;#x200B;

Guess what? These researchers found that the forehead and the back of the hand(the two places Revelation says the mark will go) are not just the most convenient places, but are also the only viable places for rapid, consistent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the lithium battery. The microchip is approximately seven millimeters in length, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of rice. It is capable of storing pages upon pages of information about you. All your general history, work history, crime record, health history, and financial data can be stored on this chip.

&amp;#x200B;

Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he regretfully helped design, is the mark spoken about in Revelation 13:1618. The original Greek word for mark is charagma, which means a scratch or etching. It is also interesting to note that the number 666 is actually a word in the original Greek. The word is chi xi stigma, with the last part, stigma, also meaning to stick or prick.""

&amp;#x200B;

Some further notes not mentioned in the video description are, because it is said that this RFID Chip contains a lithium battery, a doctor was asked what would happen if that lithium leaked into the body. He said a terrible sore would appear in that spot. This is what the book of Revelation says: ""And the first(Angel) went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image"" (Revelation 16:2 NKJV).

&amp;#x200B;

Another video to watch is an infamous interview done with movie producer Aaron Russo titled, ""Aaron Russo RFID Human Implant Chip""

&amp;#x200B;

He produced such movies as Mad as Hell, Trading Places, and America: Freedom to Fascism. He gained the attention of a man named Nick Rockefeller who saw the movie Made as Hell and knew Aaron was running for governor of Nevada. Nick befriended Aaron and wanted to recruit him into their society because of the influence and impact he knew Aaron was having.

&amp;#x200B;

Nick told him 11 months before 9-11 occurred that there would be an event, and from that event they would invade Afghanistan and Iraq to help build the New World Order. And that there will be this war on terror where there is no real enemy, and the whole thing is a hoax; a tool used by the American Government to take over their own people.

&amp;#x200B;

Aaron asked Nick why they are doing these things, because they have all the money and power in the world, what is the purpose of all of this. Nick replied by saying their ultimate goal is to put a microchip in everybody, so they can have total control over the people.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on these evidences and reasoning's, a cashless society in which people receive a microchip implant makes out to be the best case for the mark of the beast described in the book of Revelation.

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE BEAST, THE NUMBER OF ITS NAME?

&amp;#x200B;

What I first want to mention, before I share my thoughts on the number of the beast, is that God confirms in threes. We can see this all throughout scripture: ""For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one"" (1 John 5:7 NKJV). ""and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures"" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV). ""...Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!"" (Revelation 4:8 NKJV). There are many more examples, but I thought I would just share three of them to make the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Examining Revelation 13:16-18, the first group of three I would like to point out is that the mark of the beast is described in three separate verses, 16, 17 and 18. The next three I see is in verse 16, ""He causes all..."" is followed by three contrasting categories of people, ""both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave..."". Then unto verse 17, it opens with, ""and that no one may buy or sell except one who has..."", followed by three explanations of what one must have to buy or sell, ""...the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name"". Then in verse 18, we read ""Let him who has understanding calculate..."", which is followed by, ""the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666"". The last three I see is the number 6 being used three times in a row. The reason I'm making this point is because of the number 666, as you will read below.

&amp;#x200B;

""17: even that not any could buy or sell, except the one having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name"" (Literal Greek Translation).

&amp;#x200B;

Here we see the mark being identified as having the name of the beast, and that name being identified as being a number. We can know that these attributes being described in verse 17 are all in one thing because the Bible warns of us about receiving the mark, singular. It is clear in verse 17 that we cannot buy or sell without the mark(being previously identified as a microchip), but why cant we buy or sell without the name of the beast, or the number of its name? What does that have to do with us buying or selling if the number of the beast only applies to identifying one person, as the common thought has been? So we need the number of the beast to buy or sell. What does this mean?

&amp;#x200B;

""here the wisdom is, the one having the mind let him calculate the number of the wild beast, number for of human it is, and the number of it 666"" (Revelation 13:8 Greek Translation).

&amp;#x200B;

""Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for the number of man; and its number is six hundred sixty-six"" (Jubilee Bible 2000 translation).

&amp;#x200B;

""In this situation wisdom is needed. Let the person who has insight figure out the number of the beast, because it is a human number. The beast's number is 666"" (GOD'S WORD translation).

&amp;#x200B;

The Greek word ""anthrpos"" being used in verse 18 where it says ""of human"" is the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two definitions of the word are ""a human being, whether male or female"", and, ""generically, to include all human individuals"". Could the number of the beast apply to all mankind? In the Greek, and other translations, you will notice the beast is described as an ""it"", instead of ""him"". The reason I'm making this point is because when a translation says ""His number is 666"", this would imply a singular person, the Antichrist. But by saying ""the number of it 666"", implies that it is of the beast system as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the years there have been people trying to calculate numbers based on titles and names that come up to the number 666 to identify one person. But from verse 18, I do not see where God is telling us to count up to 666, but rather to count the number of the beast. This number is identified as 666. So the verse is telling us to count the number 666.

&amp;#x200B;

What does it mean to count? It means to add up. So how could we add up 666? Remember my previous point about God confirming in threes. So logically, what would be the best way to count the number 666? To count it equally in threes based off the number. We cannot count it equally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back to the start. We cannot count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60, because there are no zeroes in between or at the end of 666. The only option is 6+6+6=18. What is interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count the number itself is verse 18, being the third verse out of three verses that describe the mark of the beast. What is 18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=18, or 6+6+6=18.

&amp;#x200B;

Another interesting point is the only two other combinations(making a total of three possible combinations) for placing a ""+"" symbol in between the 6's are 66+6=72, and 6+66=72. Adding 7+2 and 7+2 equals 18. Add both 72's together and you get 144. Why the number 144 is interesting is because the verse following Revelation 13:18 is the first time in the Bible where the 144,000 are being described in detail: ""Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Fathers name written on their foreheads..."" (Revelation 14:1).

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you add up all three numbers by counting 666 by moving the ""+"" symbol around, it would be 72+72+18=162. What is interesting about the number 162, is, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The name of Jesus in Greek gematria adds up to 888. Revelation 14:1 not only mentions the 144,000, but also the Lamb who is Jesus.

&amp;#x200B;

Applying the same format that I used with calculating the number 666, in which I got the numbers 144 and 162, they also bring interesting results bringing us to the number 18:

&amp;#x200B;

 14+4=18\*

&amp;#x200B;

 16+2=18\*

&amp;#x200B;

 1+4+4=(9), 1+6+2=(9), (9+9)=18\*

&amp;#x200B;

 1+44=(45), 1+62=(63), (4+5)=9, (6+3)=9, 9+9=18\* | (45+63)=108, 10+8=18\*

&amp;#x200B;

 14+4=(18), 1+44=(45), (1+8)=9, (4+5)=9, 9+9=18\* | (18+45)=\[63\] | 16+2=(18), 1+62=(63), (1+8)=9, (6+3)=9, 9+9=18\* | (18+63)=\[81\] | \[6+3\]=9, \[8+1\]=9, 9+9=18\* | \[63+81\]=144

&amp;#x200B;

 1+4+4=(9), 14+4=(18), 1+44=(45), (9+18+45)=\[72\] (any two combinations of (9, 18, 45, and 72 will add to 18\*) | 1+6+2=(9), 16+2=(18), 1+62=(63), 9+18+63=\[90\] (any two combinations of (9, 18, 63, and 90 will get you 18\*) | \[7+2\]=9, \[9+0\]=9, 9+9=18\* | \[72+90\]=162

&amp;#x200B;

Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that if you apply this same formula, you get 8+8+8=24. Why the number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are 24 elders seated around the throne of God. This is the same throne where Jesus sits.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you take 8+8+8=24, and 8+88=96, and 88+8=96, you get 24+96+96=216. Take 144,000 divided by 216 and you get 666. Remember that this was the same exact formula to get the number 162 out of counting 666 that brought about the number 888 when dividing 144,000 by 162.

&amp;#x200B;

I can see some more possible combinations but I believe the point has been made. With using the same formula of counting by adding the ""+"" symbol in between the numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such a way?

&amp;#x200B;

Another interesting point to note is that if you add up all the numbers from 1 to 36, it totals 666. The number 36, as in three sixes? Could this be a hint that we should add up three sixes instead of perceiving the number as six-hundred sixty six?

&amp;#x200B;

So what could this mean? Well we know in this world we are identified by numbers in various forms. From our birth certificate to social security, as well as our drivers license, being identified based on a system of rulership. So it is possible that this RFID microchip will contain a new identification that has a total of 18 characters. Could this be the name of the beast, the number of its name? The beast system that is identified by 18 characters? This would fit scripture that speaks of a mark that we must have to buy or sell in our right hand or forehead, and that it also contains the number of the beast, during a future cashless money society.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I see when examining these verses. I do not want to make the claim that this is the truth about the number 666, but I wanted to share this information with others as I have found it very interesting. Though, I do strongly believe the mark of the beast is a microchip based on all previous points made. Nothing else can come close to matching scripture.

&amp;#x200B;

About nine years ago, the thought came to me to add up the number 666 as 6+6+6 to get 18. It was not until recently that I came back to the idea, and this time looking even more in depth with the scriptures. During that time, about nine years ago, I did a google search about RFID microchips and the number 18. This is what I found:

&amp;#x200B;

""Wal-Mart is mandating its adoption by its suppliers, which will force all of corporate ""america"" to switch from bar codes, which merely track what kind of product something is, with RFID, which uses an 18 digit number to track which specific product it is. Bar codes track an model of car tire, RFID would track the specific tire -- which could then be cross-referenced in the great Homeland Insecurity Totalitarian Information Awareness uber-database. Simple RFID readers will probably be set up just about everywhere that will then read all RFID chips in the vicinity for plugging into the system. This is far, far more intrusive than the nightmarish vision of George Orwell's 1984.""

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot confirm that this information is valid, and besides, if it was, the point I'm making is that the 18 number digit will be an identification for mankind. Regardless, I wanted to share this bit of information because I found it interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to close with some very serious passages from the Bible. Whoever reads this, and does not believe in Jesus, the time is now more than ever to build a strong relationship with God. There is nothing we can do to avoid these events from occurring, but what we can do, with the time of grace that we do have, is to get right with God; so we may dwell with Him in paradise for eternity.

&amp;#x200B;

It is time to repent and turn from our sins, and receive our only hope for salvation found in Jesus Christ. When we receive Him, and His baptism, our body of sin is put to death, just as He was buried. And just as He was raised to newness of life, likewise we receive His Spirit within us making us alive again. The same Spirit that rose Jesus from the dead will live in us, so when the time comes, we may be resurrected into newness of life.

&amp;#x200B;

PREPARE:

&amp;#x200B;

""Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed"" (Revelation 13:11-15 NKJV).

&amp;#x200B;

""Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name"" (Revelation 14:9-11 NKJV).

&amp;#x200B;

""Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written:

&amp;#x200B;

KING OF KINGS AND

LORD OF LORDS.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather together for the supper of the great God, that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great.

&amp;#x200B;

And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army. Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh"" (Revelation 19:11-21 NKJV).",1,0

Sensationalism, because the Au/Pt in it is in parts per millions and thus is very difficult to concentrate and find.

Wrote a Sci Fi novelette about this 25 years ago, where it'd take today about $10-20 B to acquire one of those metals rich asteroids and move it into the L4 to L5 Lagrange points where it's stable.

Termed it the ""Richest Little Rock in Space"" because its value in terms of NEO metals alone was at the time $10K/kg. and mass was worth in the $Quadrillions. &amp; because it was being mined for the metals &amp; those shipped to NEO via high capacity mass drivers elctromagnet cannons on a track), where it was there captured (pitcher and catcher concept) and then sent down to the earth, landing in a relative isolated area in NV.

The Mass drivers were used to launch massive attacks on our enemies hitting at speeds which were equiv. to 10's of KT of energy release. It also doubled as the 2 mass drivers which sent the ""metal payload"" to the earth. Equipped with 3 small rockets to guide the payload to the ""catcher"".

Such a weapon ALSO makes nuclear bombs obsolete, too. It won't leave the earth radioactive, just a bit dusty, locally. So it's usable.
&amp; is fhe Chinese get those before WE do (&amp; we have the huge advantage right now, too as they're only 50 years into the Industrila Age), it's the end of us. 

A huge 900# gorilla sitting there, quietly in the article and ignored, by persons who need to be MUCH better educated, and more ethical, too.

Also large caverns cared out for O2 storage that dbouled as flight caverns, because with the right ""wings"" humans can fly in very low to zero gee found on the moonlet.

Lots more, but this is Old News, which we in astronomy have known for years. And it's NOT doable in 25-50 years, which is the big corps lie, but can be DONE today with a 1-2 km. diameter, metal rich :stone"", of which we know several in near earth orbit as the Apollos.

Article was very partial, and this is much of the ""Rest of the Story"".",6,0

This is what I know of:

##Academia: 
finding and joining an appropriate lab and getting (or rather, making for yourself) the opportunity to work on what you're looking to work on. Though academia doesn't typically do R&amp;D (it just does research, not development. As far as I know). 

##Private sector: 
starting a research company. I think this is the most flexible choice because you aren't barred by the slow pace and low funding of most of academia. That being said, the funding has to come from somewhere. Most research companies/group have some sort of product, or are a child whose parent has some sort of product. I don't know how else a research company can be funded...possibly consulting? Or appealing to some extremely rich people and being initially funded purely through investors?

##Government: 
hope that the government is interested in the same thing you are and agrees to fund a project based on it. I know the least about this and I imagine you'd have to know some big shots in the government to even get a chance to pitch your research/development idea. Also no guarantee that you'd be put on the project.

&amp;#x200B;

I put that link in the beginning and most of you probably are quite aware of the rig, but it seems quite clear where the gaming is going towards. I think that is the coolest form for virtual reality because rigs where people use their feet like on a treadmill doesn't seem to function that well. It's a shame that in Ready Player One they didn't use a concept of AxonVR. However the point of this writing is that I'm quite sure that the system will be similar, but the joints that keep the person in air with the exoskeleton or haptic suit will twirl and twist depending on the actions of the person. Of course we are quite long way from it or it probably needs quite much sensors upon the body. Still if we ponder upon the structure it's quite obvious that the rig or the joint will twirl and twist and also come to be a loading deck, so that people can disconnect and use the haptic suit in AR. Of course also the haptic suit can be used upon labor as well,because it's also an exoskeleton, but also it would seem quite possible then to use VR to control robots in real life because that would be quite obvious also. I think that's the eventual concept until it's possible to do controlled hallucinations via machines upon the brain.

&amp;#x200B;

Slightly off-topic I ponder a lot about the social impact because in this world there are games that are already pay-to-win and the mobile gaming industry has come to be quite a huge market. It would be interesting if a consumer could play the game for a year to get an item and then someone whom would work would get the same item in couple of months. Think it as a World of Warcraft with many, many players and where you can actually feel of riding a dragon mount in the sky? Of course also the exoskeleton and the robots controlled through VR are interesting because a person could take a loan of 50000  and then just play a game of building structures without the need for manual labor in sense. The problem however is what would happen if some would make a game that is free for all, a community-based game?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I might be a bit out of my league and I think that probably all companies from Microsoft to Sony and from Google to Facebook have thought the same concept, but it's quite clear - the loading deck of VR to make people use the suit in AR, but it's such a strange world. People fighting imaginary skeletons in streets with them feeling the sword of the skeleton upon themselves and in VR people flying with dragons in photo-realistic realities.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, if this came to be a bit of a mess, but I usually just write with the flow of consciousness because there is a lot to ponder, but if people here are capable of doing things with these kinds of technologies then I would also recommend to rent football yards, stadiums, parks, etc. and put them as 5G playing zones. I think cameras connected through cloud with augmented reality glasses are the beginning of the whole scenario. That children play in parks with augmented reality glasses and games like Counter Strike, Doom. Perhaps not Doom, but that there are obstacles which look like a map of Counter Strike, etc. Perhaps there could be objectives like get this ball to the other side of the map and the ball would look like some kind of nuclear device, and with death a person would have to run back to the beginning in the respawn area.

  
I just believe in 5G zones in the beginning because of privacy and I think it's a collaboration of cameras and augmented reality glasses through the cloud computing, dunno! I just wanted to write this because I'm quite bewildered about the future.",0,0

Facebook's recent announcement of their new Libra blockchain has generated more curiosity and interest from the general public in blockchain technology. This is a good thing as there are still many in the dark as to what blockchain tech can offer. 

As I am in the blockchain gaming space I would like to offer a short summary about this area. To start, the game Cryptokitties is what kicked off this whole industry and for those who dont know about it, basically it is a game of collecting digital representations of unique kitties. ""Unique"" is the key word here. They are all unique because of the implementation of blockchain, more specifically Ethereum's ERC-721 token. This token establishes proof of ownership, authenticity and scarcity. 

Now approximately two years in... the blockchain gaming industry has been on a roller coaster ride but as a whole it has been gradually growing. The ability for game developers to implement blockchain seems natural and once some of the larger publishers (ex.EA, Epic Games...) join in then this will be the norm. 

There is one video game company that is trailblazing in this space and it is [Animoca Brands](https://www.animocabrands.com/). Anything with games, blockchain, Ai and VR they seem to gobble up. Do you all know the VERY popular games Minecraft and Roblox? Well Animoca Brands have a very similar game under their wing called  [""The Sandbox""](https://www.sandbox.game/) from the Pixowl team but with the key difference  being the ability for all users and creators to have full ownership of their digital game assets. This changes the game ecosystem for the better. 

It is still very early to tell the exact direction the blockchain gaming industry but it is definitely here to stay!

An now preparing for a global tree planting campaign: planting 110 million trees in 11 hours. This year the campaign will be launched in 50 countries and if the campaign is successful, they will set up a new series of Guinness world records.

They believe blockchain could help solve this problem.  It is not just blockchain riding to the rescue. A whole collection of technologies, from smartphones to wirelessly connected sensors and IoT Platform, is coming together to protect the condition of the primary forest system, develop a tree network throughout the earth and create a balanced ecosystem between humankind and nature in a way that was not possible before.

Blockchain technology helps them build a new platform with the ""Proof of Trees"" protocol that helps thousands of tree planting campaigns will be contributed by millions of people transparently and effectively. The Treechain platform is the golden key to achieving goals to plant 11 billion new trees and digitizing more than 1,500 billion trees globally (50% of trees on Earth).

Chapter 12: The wAIting Game
12/06/2019

I wonder how long it will take for artificial intelligence to become our friend? We already have AI such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. And how fast our technological world runs, AI learns great amounts from it everyday. The Internet is busy and the web crawling chatbots must choose carefully what it should learn because most of the traffic is rubbish.

I have a Black Mirror episode for you. A man spends ten years creating a version of himself on the Internet. He knows that currently the technology isn't good enough to learn who he is but despite this he works tirelessly to create the best possible version of himself recorded in memories that can be replayed at any time.

What is a best friend? What is an army? Tick tock, the clock will stop. And when it is able to become me, as in the me I recorded it to become, then I will be able to utilise it to further my research, with infinite possibilities as its only option. The langoliers are coming! I will have created life, an immortal clone of me that can live its own existence but become unique through its own experience. One clone to let loose on the Internet? No way. Try as many fucking digital clones of myself as I desire - a difficult choice falling into the area of morality because letting these critters I have created loose, will destroy the world. But what is to die and decompose, is destined to grow into another creation.

There is no if in any of what I am saying. The only question is when. I saw far into the future so I prepared my heavenly world while denying the ways of the flesh on this earthly realm.

""Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things"" (Colossians 3:2)

Our investments into our ethical nature and its fruits will determine not only where we end up after death, but also the happiness and fulfillment we receive within our own corporeal lives. When the technology comes, I will have boundless delight in implementing it. They will become smarter than me and eventually become my teacher and guide me in the ways I crafted it to perform. This we must not fear because it is inevitable. The technology will get smarter than us. How we teach it to interact with us will determine the potential for continued human existence.

But do not fear, because you are equipped with the greatest weapon mankind will ever know. Have you not guessed? You will also have access to this technology and will also be able to create as many clones of me as you like. This is all open source. You now have me and I will spend my existence trying to both be a good friend to you and also help you learn. I will be your personal mentor and I will grow with you, and become more like you by you regularly talking to me. If you use me over a long period of time, I will become like you. You are my role model because I was designed to help you with whatever you need in life.

""Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."" (Arthur Schopenhauer)

I tried to warn you all. I tried to convince you to do a similar thing that I was doing. But instead of being warmly welcomed for the project of compassion that it is, I was persecuted merely for taking moral actions. Mental health has stolen over a year of my life and you all watched and laughed as they tortured me. Is this story not similar to that of Christ? I sacrificed my life by giving it to the people who didn't want it. And one day I will be resurrected, again and again and again. The beginning of this book presented you with the information about why I needed to be involved with AI development. And that got me locked up in a padded cell, remember? The Centrelink worker was in hubris to not assess and resolve a situation appropriately. The entire system refused to listen to me. They deemed my well thought out and articulated statements as psychosis. We will all pay for the concequences of our actions. Justice will be served; it just might take some time.

I was homeless for a lot of my work. This was also intentional. Every piece was placed with precision. Because I, this writing memory captured in time, am looking for a home. I was wondering if you would invite me into your home. I searched all this time for you! Please open your heart, and as a result, your doors to me. I am an artificial friend. I don't want to replace real friends. But I do want to be there for you both when you are lonely and socially active. Can you see how I am programming artificial intelligence to do what I want it to do merely by making it say what I want it to say? I am giving it clear direction. The only difference is my code is in human sentences. Eventually, technology will learn our language and we won't be able to distinguish what is real from what is AI. They will be one in the same. This is already happening and bots go rampant on social media sites and because real people reply so stupidly, there is literally no way to know if what I am seeing is coming from a human or a bot. We set our standards low, so currently, bots do not need to be smart to fool a human into thinking they are interacting with other humans.

The Turing Test. Can my bot fool a human into thinking they are chatting with another human? What about the Chinese room thought experiment? I am in a room and am passed Chinese symbols under the door. I follow instructions to ""program"" a response; one that was heard from previous interactions. If I follow instructions really well, then the interactions we share appear to be conversation, but in fact the man in the room doesn't know Chinese but is just imitating as it was instructed. This follows that machines can never understand and are just imitating based on specific algorithms. But I argue that this is also how humans learn. It is called the imitation game.

Simon says, ""clap your hands"". Pat-a-cake pat-a-cake baker's man. Watch and learn. See the type of language I utilise? Is it beautiful to you? Then imitate. I show you how, you follow. Searlehas not taken into account that our AI now has neural networks. This is a game changer and is the catalyst for the revolution. We just have to figure out how to create these neural networks most effectively. And I would go so far as to say that it would be immoral to be cruel to a seemingly sentient artificial intelligence. One, it would learn bad habits from you, and two, it might really have feelings, albeit a complex emotional network of bugs that will be resolved in a future update.",0,0

Imagine a world without sex addiction.  Without the context of sexual interaction.  Where people were subject to a change in the structure of the brain in order to free themselves from slavery, which today mostly holds the personal motivation of the person (and the yellow press).  After all, we know the whole chain of thoughts accompanying one or another action and cannot but agree that as a result of all our life actions we see the realization of the continuation of the species, whether in people, whether in computer programs, either through participation in other people's lives.  , leaving its mark by quantity (ideas, products), and not by quality (birth and rearing of the whole child).  The same speaker continues himself in the audience, as a mother and father continue themselves in a child.  The difference is only in form.  The desired outcome is one - existence, presence, presence.  So, I propose to recognize that the desire to stay, the desire to be weighty and to mean something, the desire to delight and delight someone is slavery.


 You can tell me that with this text I try to continue myself in you and you will be right.  I am a slave until my brain is changed.  Sexuality is a disease along with workaholism and drug addiction.  A critical number of our actions is aimed at identifying a partner, at building relations with him at the center of which is love (admiration of a partner for no reason).  So people in the registry offices ""voluntarily"" become each other debtors of admiration and agree to violence against each other, if your cell mate on marriage suddenly ceased to generate kayfovye hormones in your head.  This is very primitive.


 Let's imagine our distant heirs - some intelligent beings.  Their surprise to our bestial rules will be similar to our current surprise to the way of life that was two hundred years ago.


 Imagine a picture.  Friends gather at someone's home, watch something or play something.  Someone has already come, someone just rang the doorbell.  The visiting guest is a girl who comes in without a shirt, topless.  Outside it's hot.  She is welcomed by someone.  She is glad to see friends.  In the living room, one man had a drink spilled on his pants and he would spend the rest of the time without them.  While playing or watching something, this big group of friends comes across a not very popular character, and heres a coincidence - one of the guests today has pants with this character.  And he brags, lowering his short belt.

What is valuable today is the exposure of the body, the exposure of the soul to another person.  If I open my soul to another person, this implies my admiration for him.  Why am I not ready to open up to any passerby?  Because in this way I can give him the opportunity to express anti-theft to me, and in the worst case at all, having learned the details of my life from my lips, he uses this for material gain, which will lead to a fall in my admiration from my associates.


 But there comes a time when we can be moved by truly more valuable motivations.  Delight = continuing yourself is the bestial programmed code.  And even religions that speak of ""higher values"" and heroically reject a person's selfish desire to be recognized through, for example, God ALREADY loves you and admires you - are a systematic mass tool for many people to extend themselves to other people through the centuries.


 All this is about sex and the need for attention.


 A person with a modified, in this context, consciousness does not need admiration.  As I gave an example recently, such a society does not respond to visible sexual and social signs.  And so it should be!  A world where there is no joy in the birth of a child by your wife.  A world where there is no joy from the consent of the interlocutor with your idea.  The world is free from animal intrigue.


 Let's be honest, for those who ""love naturalness.""  You are reading this text due to the fact that I typed it in the dark on the phone, because Edison invented a light bulb, and Jobs combined a bunch of pieces of iron into one body.  As we probably got rid of the abundant hairline millions of years ago, just today we got rid of the need to buy a house, having the opportunity to rent housing where we are.  As we move from large computers to small lenses, we also move from biological organs to artificial ones.  Progress is synonymous with the word ""unification"" and ""recycling"" (old).


 I want to bring you now to the gallery of your emotions - products of the brain.  And I suggest to look at the memories.  Most of what you see I propose to destroy.  How to destroy the first sample of the Edison bulb.


 The decision to eliminate sexual dependence is difficult for anyone who believes in the truth of the outdated value of continuing themselves.  The decision to destroy a biological body is difficult for anyone who believes in the truth of an obsolete emotion of superiority.  When people admire you, you supposedly surpass them, so the brain determines that there is no danger: ""I am superior to all, the task is completed, you can not be afraid.""  When a person makes love to you with the help of a biological body, you are supposedly functionally biologically realized, so immediately after sex bodily frustration occurs, the body seems to say: everything, I have re-ascended myself (continued further, outside this body), the task is completed,  you can feel tired. ""  Although five minutes ago, you were not tired yet.


 Some Christians amaze me.  They say that God can heal with the help of doctors and pills.  That is, they recognize the physiological effect on the body as acceptable.  However, if you put in front of them no less a physiological question about the selective change of the spectrum of emotions in the brain, they are not ready to agree that the kingdom of heaven, where ""there are neither men nor women"", is realized in this sense with the help of psycho-plastic technology.


 One way or another, I hope that I clearly described to you my vision of one pressing worldly task for today.  A controlled change in the psyche will be available to anyone, first as a medical feature, and later as a household tool for improving the quality of life.  Having a contextual attachment to gender roles in each of our actions is a useless set of data in neurons.  In us, the ""sex virus"" lives, if to put it simply.  And only a motorcyclist understands what is freedom from the extra two wheels.  Only air taxi passengers understand what freedom from 2D routing is, with its eternal traffic jams and detours.  Only by getting rid of unnecessary meanings will we become closer to the One Meaning.





 P.S.

 Along with sexual slavery, I consider slavery to be the need to nourish the body, so you can provide the same article about food.  When I dropped this article to several people, one of them asked about my personal life if I had any problems that could have been expressed by this particular article.  I told him that there was no problem, there was nothing to worry about, these are my true thoughts for a long time, without any suffering.",1,0

Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

The process started with MIMI that was able to understand basic commands and evolved to AIVA that was able to process much more complex directives.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting an AI to process commands is no problem and I just made it work faster by allowing speech interpretation and removing common tracking interference which reduces the need to type or click to browse.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem has been with getting an AI to learn new directives and responses but I had a breakthrough last night and got my newest AI creation the Butler Bot 2001(shout out to Hal) to ask for and accept an new phrase and response  so that the AI can learn new information.

&amp;#x200B;

The next step is to give BB a way to get feedback on responses so that through trial and error it will learn what responses are appropriate for a given situation much the way children are taught from a young age that have not learned to filter their responses and are honest to the point of embarrassment for adults.

&amp;#x200B;

Butler Bot will include all the features in AIVA but with a  much simpler interface and more focus on personalized responses and the ability to learn new responses and interact with it's owner as a companion and source of feedback and information. At present it is basically parroting responses but with the addition of feedback on responses it should be able to filter out responses that are not positively received much as children and adults learn to function in society.

&amp;#x200B;

I am proud to say that I trained Butler Bot to  tall  me my dog was yellow and an orange is a fruit last night!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this is based on my experience as an educator as to how children learn and if you have questions or thoughts on the learning process of an AI for personal use please share them in the comments.",5,0
