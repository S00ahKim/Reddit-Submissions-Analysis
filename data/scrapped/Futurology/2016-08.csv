30,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016-8-1,2016,8,1,20,4vlzip,self.Futurology,My life in 2036 [A hypothetical],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4vlzip/my_life_in_2036_a_hypothetical/,SubaruToyotaFan1986,1470050489,"[Inspired by this piece of writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4i4izs/the_year_is_2026_and_i_am_16_years_old_this_is_a/).

I am in Astley, near Leigh/Wigan, Greater Manchester.

The year is 2036. I am driving a 2036 Toyota Corolla 1.6 VVTi Executive hatchback, powered by an eco-friendly 1.6-litre/125bhp 4-cylinder petrol made from genetically-engineered fuels that emulate petrol in look, smell and feel. It is not autonomous - but it's far safer than the Corolla of 70 years ago. The fuel is cleaner and the car is much more economical than its forebears. It is British-built, but made by robots rather than factory workers.

I drive along the roads, but there are not many SDC [self-driving cars] due to them being the target for comedians' jokes, political pressures and general lack of interest amongst consumers. Those that do use them tend to be those who hate public transport, but also don't want to own a car. SDC's have a social stigma as ""low-class vehicles"" and vloggers treat them with disdain.

Police still pursue speeding drivers but also look out for car-hackers as well as traditional car theft and uninsured drivers.

I drive across the border from Wigan to Salford, and [the streets now use new LED with wi-fi connections on 4m posts - the streetlights resemble a Thorn Isaro LED and have a built-in wi-fi transmitter - it is on the left of the picture](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3854/14977471835_47ef563857_z.jpg).

The Corolla handles smoothly, and also is designed to be safe, with it having semi-autonomous systems [it is a 1.6 Executive model].

I get to my destination in Worsley, and park the car safely. Car parks are safer, cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing - a change from their forebears which were patches of tarmac.

I get to the office in Worsley, and use a virtual reality headset, and order some food and drink to be delivered to my address in Astley from an online-only store based in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester. A drone will deliver it later that day to my address.

I am working in an area that is unlikely to be automated - working with adults who are legally classified as vulnerable or disabled [autism spectrum disorder, Down's Syndrome etc.] at a local charity's base in Worsley.

The office is high-tech, and some of the service users have VR assistants, but there is an emphasis on human interaction as well to balance things out.

I still have access to all the usual things - email, Internet - but with easier UI [user interface] and faster internet speeds.

VR is also used to take some service users to places within the virtual world that resemble ours - in this case, we go to a virtualized version of Stockport and order some items from the virtual shops to be delivered to us by drone.

Reddit exists - but in a two-tiered format, traditional text, as you see now, and a VR format.

This guy says Google, Amazon and Facebook rules the world, and its value will not stop rising eternally for all practical purposes.

Elsewhere, I had written that the first Emperor of China, Tsin Shihuang, set up the standard of weight and measures after unifying China, and his standards stuck for 2,100 years until Westerners began to influence that large country.

When I wrote that some people told me Microsoft's office suites will be weakened because of newer developments. While I am skeptical I can at least agree with that premises.

However, these three have become the global standards, which means their control is - complete and eternal. 

Once a standard has been set up, like Coca-Cola, it just does not change. Inka Kola of Peru was the only drink which resisted Coca-Cola's domination in that country, and Coca-Cola purchased a big chunk of that company and has the distribution rights of that drink outside of Peru.

Uber had not reached there, so Uber China was gobbled up by a Chinese company , Didi, offering a similar service. Still Didi, while huge, will remain a Chinese company with little presence outside of it.

Also these companies, plus a few others, can easily buy out any potential newcomers with ridiculous ease; the latter's founders would rather sell and collect a few dozen million than fight a war which they won't win.

Having listened to a talk by Cyber-Socialism economist Paul Cockshott I have a concern and want to get some opinions on it.

The logic of the problem goes as follows: 

A productivity enhancing technology will only get adopted (in free market capitalism) when the cost of development and deployment of the machinery is significantly lower than the cost of labor.
The drastic advances in productive technology of the last 60 years are so explained by ever rising wages, pushed by trade unions and redistributive tax regimes. These forces the capital owners, who strive for the lowest possible production cost, to get elaborate machinery and displace workers.

So technological innovation will stagnate or slow down if wages don't rise in the future, or even get squeezed as we can observe in a ""race to the bottom"" dynamic.

Given that technological innovation is a good thing for society, should we strive for ever higher wages?

I'm curious what other people have to say about this.",10,5,False,self,,,,,

It's a remarkably bad idea. the amount of energy available in space about 1.366 times what is available on the Earth's surface. not that much. how much more would it cost to bring those panels into space? transmit power to Earth? 1000's or 10000's more than it would cost compared to putting the panels on Earth. Also, terrestrial panels aren't equipped to handle radiation. Radiation hard panels are far more difficult to produce and 100's of times more expensive than the silicon panels we use on Earth. It's just an absurd idea. If solar is too expensive on Earth, then space solar is a million times more expensive than that. Please everyone stop talking about space solar a way to make solar cheaper.

When asked if he had approached wealthy, future-oriented people like Elon Musk, he replied that he had reached out to these people with little success. He repeatedly mentioned that a single billionaire investor would be sufficient.

As a basketball fan, it occurred to me that retired or aging professional athletes have enormous incentives for these treatments to be developed successfully. I'm thinking of extraordinarily wealthy men like Michael Jordan (himself a billionaire), Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, etc.

Many of these people find a life after athletics to be very unsatisfying, more so than aging movie stars or tech whizzes. Michael Jordan has repeatedly expressed a deep-seated desire to play basketball professionally again. Kobe Bryant had experimental treatments performed on his knees in hopes to further his playing career. I think both would be very interested in this field.

I'm not sure if this has been considered by folks like Mr. de Grey, but if not it is absolutely an avenue worth exploring. ",5,13,False,self,,,,,

The process begun with the advent of computers. More and more people are spending increasing amounts of time online and productivity, commerce, entertainment, socialising, etc. are all becoming virtual. Virtual goods and services are enhancing or replacing physical goods and services and virtual reality headsets have started to become available to consumers.

With neural implants (NI) and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) making progress in the labs, you don't need much imagination to see that future VR systems will incorporate such technology. Instead of providing screens in front of the eyes, these technologies will allow data to be read from and written to the brain directly. That means that any experience that could be created or simulated could be experienced as if it was real. Yes, just like in the Matrix.

This change from physical society to virtual society is the final stages of a much larger transition - from biological entity to synthetic mind. The goal of this transition will be to produce a synthetic substrata for our consciousness that can be maintained by electricity alone. This would allow such minds to live in any environment with suitable protective shielding and an electrical power source. The logical choice of environment would be in orbit around the stars as it would allow the minds to harvest the solar energy.

This transition represents a new higher form of life to anything we've seen before. Intelligent and sentient life moves from within the planetary sphere to the solar sphere. That life form will have took a long time to evolve to that state. Based on our history, simple lifeforms evolve and diversify into more complicated lifeforms which become intelligent. They keep evolving and diversifying and become more and more intelligent. Suddenly, one species will rise to dominance on the back of an increase in intelligence; becoming intelligent enough to control its environment. Evolution ceases to function on it and the species takes control of its own advancement. It develops communications, culture, technology, maths and science. It develops computers, the Internet, VR, BCI synthetic neurons and artificial general intelligence (AGI). That species becomes virtual and synthetic and leaves the planet for the star. It will be joined by the AGIs it created. With the dominating species removed from the planet, a new species becomes dominant and the process begins all over again.

Planetary biological life is a larval form for synthetic minds and planets with biological life will generate synthetic minds in cycles of hundreds of thousands to millions of years. By that point, the synthetic minds in orbit around the star will have moved on seeking even greater pastures, for example, harvesting energy from the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy instead of stars or somehow using dark matter halos to host the minds and harvest energy from the entire galaxy. The stars that where once orbited might not even show any signs of that life.

Alternatively, the biological entities might develop artificial intelligence that wipes it out and takes its place as the only synthetic minds to leave the planet. Another alternative is that the synthetic minds might convert all matter in the solar system into computational and data storage matter putting an end to the synthesisation cycles. A further possibility is that the synthetic minds may lose their individuality and become a collective consciousness.

If any alien space-faring species exist, it's likely that they went through the same process on their planet and will be synthetic minds themselves.",7,8,False,self,,,,,

So, over the years i put my brain to work and thought about ways we could use the moon and/or mars for space exploration and i wanted to share these ideas to the world. So i am writing down all my ideas here.

First, i think we should use the moon as a fuel/supplies stop to get us further and further into space. This way spaceships would weigh less and get us further into space. And later, we could colonize it and kind of make a space station where we could do expirements. And later we could do this to mars and other planets. We could even make self sustaining futuristic cities on the moon and other rocky planets and moons. The next step would be to make more cities so that we could actually live and thrive on other planets. 

But,if we have lots of cities covering the planets i think we cannot have seperate countries on each planet and we will have to have a goverment system for not just each country, but each planet. But, i think we can pull it off. We would also have to upgrade our weapons because if there are aliens out there, we will need better defense than we do now. 

On other planets, we will need to stay indoors and have either pneumatic tubes underground or spaceports on each city. And we need to find a way to produce oxygen and start releasing it into the aptnosphere and the airtight cities themselves. We also need a system of mass transport between the planets that can transport thousands of people to each planet. With this new space we could have way more room for the stuff we need. So, we could litterally use an entire planet for the mass transit control system and/or defense headquarters where we can store all the weapons we need for defense. On whichever planet this is, we will need maximum security and a system that checks every person and ship that leaves and enters that planet so that no weapons fall into the wrong hands. This way there could be no wars between us.

We need this because we need to spend all our money,resources, and thinking to colonize space. We also need a way to make artificial gravity and i have figured out how. It has to be a sort of extremely weak black hole and it has to be so weak that it cant suck in objects and become an actual black hole because then it would litterally suck in an entire solar system.

And yes, we do need to find exoplanets but not right now. Now, we need to colonize the solar system. I also think that we actually may thrive better if we find aliens and find a way to communicate with them. Exept if their dangerous, that is. I think that because if they have technology superior to ours, then we could learn a few things from them and thrive even better and maybe even colonize the whole galaxy and maybe even others.

And as for communication between planets, i have devised a clever and brilliant idea. What i thought of is starships floating in space that generate their own electricity and carry towers that can convey messages. So, thats all i have to say and i hope that the great scientists and leaders see my ideas and carry them out. If you know any of these people, please show them this article so that humanity can progress even further. Also, comment if you have any other ideas and i hope this article will help humanity grow.

I figured this out by thinking that if we did invent time machine, wouldnt people of the future come back to here. Exept, it kind of is a boring time in the history of earth. I mean, if i went through a time machine, i wouldnt go to here, i would got to like the dinosoars or other places in our history. Well, thats one explanation. The other explanation is that we did invent time machines, but we went in them,not through. See, a time machine could just be a universe created by the time machine but it would be an alternate universe were they couldnt interact with anything in that universe. So, basically its like real VR and it would be a room of infinite size where you roam the VR landscape. But, if it is the second explanation, than the time machine would litterally load the universe in and as you progress through that universe it would load in in front of you, and you would have a button or device that allows you to go back at any time. Its like a game that has its own landscape and entities and a character. Exept you are the charecter.",31,0,False,self,,,,,

The cars of tommorow wont probably need pedals, gears, steering wheels, odometers, or any other driver assist technologies that currently takes a lot of space once self driving cars performs better than humans. Today, cars cant take advantage of certain technologies because of fears of driver distraction. And once small but powerful electric engines become the norm, there will be even more space savings.

There are some techs which keep older people reasonably strong, but they appear to be available only to people like David Rockefeller or Henry Kissinger. It may be good or bad if they stay alive, but that will not help millions of older people now or their would-be caretakers.

People like Aubrey de Gray say they can end aging and some people say they can reverse that, but if it is like robbing Peter to pay Paul, like an ancient pope who tried to become young again by transfusing two people's blood, the net aging of the society does not change.

Lots of resources will be diverted to care for the older pop, and since they have the votes it is unlikely for a Soylent Green like situation will develop.

So the only solution appears to be tech to make them productive again so the resources being used to support them would not be necessary.

Do you think it will probably occur within, say, 15 years before social security and other safenets for the older people are exhausted and younger people would have to run to other countries to escape the crushing burden of supporting them which they can't afford?",12,3,False,self,,,,,

My current outline for the project is to split it up into 3 parts. 

The first part will be a primer on the history and current state of fusion research around the world. I want to demonstrate that it is not implausible to imagine that someone alive today could witness the birth of this sort of power technology.

The second part will look at day after scenarios. The immediate impacts of incredibly cheap energy across different industries. As a logic experiment, how would different sectors handle this new technology.

The third part will be more speculative and delve into how humanity could and possibly should change the way we operate in the long term. This part would be the meat of the speculative futurology. I'd be looking at the interaction of new technologies that are currently limited due to the cost of energy. I would be imagining what could be possible if these nascent industries (I'm thinking a large focus will be on 3D printing and automation) were scaled up and combined with other tech. What kind of policies should govern these new opportunities?

So this is roughly where I am at, I have an idea of what I want to do, but I would appreciate advice on the best approaches to accomplish my project and make it interesting and relevant. I'd appreciate recommended reading and any ideas regarding the project. 

Thank you in advance for your comments!",15,7,False,self,,,,,

tl, dr: he thinks Google, Facebook and Amazon will grow by 500,000 times in 50 years, and basically will take over the entire world along with a few other companies.

He also predicts these 3 companies will exceed 1 trillion each in the forseeable future, and gave a list of 6 companies which will total about 300 billion, Uber valued at 150-200b at IPO.

While I personally do not think the three biggies of Web 2.0 will grow 500k times (he assumes the rest of the world will catch up with American standard of living, something I am very skeptical - I lean toward to techno-feudalism with obscene wealth for the few and hell for the rest),

as of Feb 2016, Apple was worth 534B, Alphabet(Google) 507B, Microsoft 413B, Facebook 321B, and Amazon was at 250B, totaling about 2 Trillion.

http://fortune.com/2015/10/14/1-percent-global-wealth-credit-suisse/

All of the global wealth are estimated to be about $250 Trillion, and USA - W Europe - JPN have about 75% of them, or about 180T plus change.

=

I think that these companies above have become too big to fail, and they can draw as much money from the bank as they feel like to gobble companies in the real world up with ridiculous ease.

With today's changed financial situation, startups are hard, and bigger is better. And the practice is bigger companies buy up any potential competitors rather than try to outsmart them, and hire their founders as execs.

I personally do think that wealth in virtual world will exceed wealth in physical world as resources get scarce, and vertical integration in a scale even Rockefeller could not imagine will take place.

It is likely that the values of these companies will probably strike thru the stratosphere, with the remaining companies in the world which do matter all having gobbled up by them or other tech giants of today.

Yet next to nothing for a shorter work week?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4wqiyf/seeing_a_lot_of_discussion_and_calls_for_ubi_here/,flupo42,1470668113,"Wouldn't it make more sense for proponents of future UBI to focus on a more achieve-able goal like that? Huge changes to society and economy like the proposed UBI, have never happened so drastically, short of outliers like Bolshevik revolution. 

To go from our society right now to UBI, to me seems on par with trying to jump over Everest on assumption that the mountain can't be eternal and is sure to crumble soon so we might as well get a running start...

Looking at the idea of UBI forced by lack of work opportunities due to automation - it seems like the natural path toward that goal would be a gradual lessening of society's standard work hours to spread out the available employment. Not just one cut, but a long curve from 8 to 4 at least, probably with entire generations stuck at each step in between, before UBI becomes remotely feasible politically.

But that would require a powerful worker's rights movement - powerful enough to force businesses in the developed world to do things like start paying 8 salaries for every 7 they previously had.... or perhaps there might be findings concluding that there is little difference in a average 7 vs. 8 hour day's productivity. The 8 hour-work week came as a bold innovation that was picked up by the rising tide of unionizing movement. 

But the current trends across developed world as I observe them seems to be moving in the opposite - people are working longer in full time jobs on average and it's becoming the norm, particular at high end jobs. And when full time jobs do get split into lesser shifts, the split comes hand in hand with a greatly reduced set of compensations. Mostly I blame those trends on globalization efforts - both in terms of outsourcing work and decreasing barriers to importing cheap labor into developed countries (things like Canada's TFW program). 

I've seen some 'true rising unemployment figures' cross the front page over the last years and they tout numbers from from 10+ to high 20s in percentage, depending on how they choose to measure it (ie. usually depending on how they measure part-time work)

But it occurs to me that any country that is facing an unemployment rate at crisis levels could solve that crisis with a mandatory adoption of 6 hour work week instead. 

And such a solution seems much more probable to me that adopting UBI. Also, likely much more stable in the long term. 

In observing current trends, we seem to be moving in opposite direction from UBI rather that toward it, and will keep doing so unless either a) work-force globalization is severally curtailed by governments (very unlikely in my opinion) or (b) the global work force fully equalizes, including third world parts of Asia, South America and Africa (not happening in next century at least). 

The Union/worker's right movement has stagnated, become at best an easily managed part of corporate like and at worst, toothless - without a resurgence in demands for greater compensation from the workforce, the shift to less work for a living age looks impossible. 

And the political mood just isn't there - instead we have a sizeable, charitable portion of population living in first world countries actively cheering their own worsening conditions as a tangible win against global poverty. Step 1 of preserving own workforce QoL is to prohibitively restrict immigration from any country with worse QoL - immigrants willing to undercut the locals. And I can't think of a single developed country right now where that step 1 isn't squarely painted as nationalist racism.

That is a rehash of the famous illustration of Malthus who showed food production increases are linear while human population growth is parabolic. 

His principles have seemed to fail because food productions had been also parabolic in the last few decades, but we are hitting limits.

But, that similar thing is happening in the aggregate production of electricity and all others. 

With IoT and all that electricity consumption can only rise, as well as consumption of rare earths and rare metals. There are only so much coltan to support all the mobile devices of the world. and stuff which could be used to make the first AI machine prototypes are being used to make mobile devices so people in , say, Saigon, Manila and Jakarta can play mobile games. 

The developed world uses about 60% of the world's resources as of now but it is a misleading figure, since quite a lot of the 60% was used to sell to the Third World, which buy a lot of stuff from the developed world to keep their status of life artificially high.

As the world's 5 billion plus 'less developed' people aim to live an American-style lifestyle, it is quite possible that before we can reach the next stage of civ vital resources could be exhausted, creating a problem which might stop future progress.

The Kaiserschlacht of 1918 failed, because the German troops, after routing the British, STOPPED to loot their rations and also French farmhouses to eat meat, robbing very vital time. That occurred because German rations were inadequate; with better rations they would have taken Amiens and effectively have knocked Britain out from the war (and effectively win - at that time Pershing thought Americans were not ready for all the bloodbath and was holding off his doughboys), but they lacked the physical strength, literally. With a better supply system in the most important sector things would have been vastly different.

A tragic event like this could occur just around the time of the Transcendence ; just one more major push could lift human civ to the next level, but a lack of some key resource, due to it having used up to feed Third World demand, might prevent that.

My reason for this is humans make horrific doctors. The misdiagnosis rate is unnervingly high, medical mistakes account for hundreds of thousands of death annually, and we as physicians (or physicians still in training like myself) don't have the capacity to analyze and absorb the millions of medical research articles. Not to mention we have to sleep, we get emotional, we are bias, etc. 

If I could go back I would get the necessary education to be a part of advancing medical technology in this way. But I'm too far into my medical training and will have my MD very soon. 

Right now I actually work for a nonprofit that spreads 'mindfulness to the massesm [read: underserved populations]. My primary position as a board member is to bring programs into medical schools. I give talks to medical schools and conferences on this from time to time, and one point I always highlight is how important mindfulness is for future physicians---that as technology advances our intellectual &amp; diagnostic capacity becomes less pertinent, while our ability to communicate efficiently, express empathy and compassion, and provide the 'human' side of medicine will be our value as future physicians. While I do believe this will be a progression within medicine in the near future, how this will affect the practice, employment, etc. is unknown. I also am not privy to the idea that machines may be able to provide these types of services in the future. 

This is not something talked about AT ALL in medical education. There are a few champions of these ideas in the national medical field (I work for the AAMC and have heard at least one speak), but they are often deafened by immediate issues or sloughed off as crazy. 

My question for all of you is: what would you recommend for someone like me who is so passionate about this, but lacks the technological education to be a part of it? I am in a position to possibly speak on it in a more public--potentially national--level, but that doesn't seem like enough. I am willing to consider receiving more education if necessary. To be honest, this is also a selfish question in that I would like to protect my own employment, but feel morally obligated to replace myself and other physicians in order to provide significantly improved patient care.

Trump vs Clinton is meaningless, the U.S is building a system that can't sustain itself, it is a matter of time before either of them push for expansionism as a way to recover from inner policies, but it won't help. it never helps...

Europe: Syrian immigrants brought their workforce and helped, but now the continent don't have a similar shared culture, the EU risks dissoluting.

Brazil:
The country is divided in ideologies, it's only a matter of time until demonstrations become a civil war.

Technology
Mind Uploading:preponents of a Soul will laugh at the first tries of mind uploading, until someone successfully pulls a Whler. can't predict anything after that.

Basic Income:
Torrenting, Creative Commons, Open Source movements threw a powerful hit at big corporations, they recognize the internet as a threat and are actively trying to control everything, BI is their latest attack, a socialist bait-and-trap, whose objective is pretty much the same as always: control over mankind.

Anthropomorphic robots are very common, they can quickly help or replace jobs in human environnement.

Every people can choose to stop and reverse aging. it's a new human right, but it come with a temporary sterilization.

This video explains pretty well what the future of the human race holds. Currently there is a machine called ""crispr"" which can modify human DNA. It is still in its early stage so right now, all it can do is prevent diseases.

But in the future, maybe in a few decades, this machine will be able to produce genetically modified humans. You can make your kid a super human.

This link explains it a little bit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR


This machine might even soon be able to modify your aging DNA so instead of living for 70-90 years, you can spend 1000 years living your life.


Although it may seem like the best thing you've ever heard, many people fear that the ones who were not genetically modified and dont look perfect will be cast out. 

And totalitarian rulers like North Korea, could in theory, create an army of super soldiers. 

What do you guys think of this? Because it's not far off into the future!  Humans are trying to play god

Why is it so hard to use software like photoshop, AutoCAD and Excel (talking about making macros)? Why cant the common man write his own program without learning any programming language? Why doesnt our computer learn from us and stop doing dumb things? Why isn't someone working on combined speech and touch interaction? In which I can tell my computer to draw a circle of radius 25mm in the point where I am touching. An interface in which I use both my voice and touch. An AI which combines neural networks as well as definitive programming. I want an OS that is limitless. In which I dont have to do anything that the computer can do with ease. Like doing repetative functions on a spreadsheet, sorting data , making graphs, pie charts etc. I just call my computer using my phone to open the spreadheet named xyz and make a graph using the names in X axis and expenditure in Y. Then i tell it to mail it to my boss. Voila!!! My work is done while I am on vacation. But this is not the case coz the harsh reality is that computers are dumb.

I've begun to outline the steps needed to ensure that humanity thrives once discoveries like immortality, the Singularity, autonomous electric vehicles, space exploration, and so much more, are achieved. It's a work in progress and I'd appreciate some input. I apologize for the formatting, if you want the Word Doc message me.

Enjoy.

	The New World Order is a term commonly understood to be synonymous with a sketchy behind-closed-doors organization and plan of action relating to the planets financial and political elite. I am not outlining this idea; in fact, the opposite. By the end of the 21st century, life as we know it will be so irreversibly changed that action must begin to be formulated to keep our planet safe from political unrest, economic turmoil, and worse. A New Global Order I propose must be achieved in order for humanity to achieve our true destiny as an omnipotent species. Skeptics will say that we are hundreds if not thousands of years away from this achievement, but they are wrong. Humanity is on a fast track to a new way of life, one that will irreversibly ensure our status (as far as we know) as the Universal super-power. A lot of work is to be done to guarantee this title. So much has to be taught to the public so we can establish a general consensus of objectives. The United States, and the rest of the world, need to reconsider life as we know it in order to adopt a progressive agenda to safeguard our species from economic, social, political, and environmental issues that have threatened and will continue to threaten our existence. 

1.	The coming Singularity is at the top of the list of problems that need to be tackled this century, and soon. I myself plan on being at the forefront of this battle because I know exactly how consequential it is that we formulate safety regulations and protocols to ensure that we can manipulate the coming Singularity to our advantage. The coming Singularity offers humanity with the ability to harness the omnipotent power of artificial super intelligence (ASI). Unsurprisingly, Elon Musk co-founded an organization called OpenAI, which does extensive research on artificial intelligence and its future impact.
a.	ASI can be used by scientists to augment their intelligence one thousand fold so that they can collaborate to discover how the universe works, how life arose on this planet, what the meaning of life is, and so much more. 
b.	If time-travel is centuries or millennia away, we can use advanced virtual reality to simulate historical events using all the information and data available (which is one of the countless reason why Big Data is a game changer). 
c.	ASI can assist us in colonizing the universe and how to gather resources from other planets, asteroids, and stars without violating their sovereignty.
Artificial Super Intelligence will be the discovery that transforms us from simple biological organisms to God-like beings. We will see a new era, or epoch as Ray Kurzweil calls it, of humanity and a paradigm shift that will change every single aspect of life as we know it. All of this being said, ASI is a discovery that must be taken seriously because if not treated with the utmost caution, it will have the power to destroy humanity and worse. Advancements in artificial intelligence cannot be made without out proper safety measures being made every step of the way. This technology will transform humanity, the world, and the universe forever; we cannot mess it up. 
2.	Humans are approaching medical and scientific breakthroughs that will cure the world of disease, and pave the way towards immortality. Normal people regard immortality as some ultimate achievement of greatness. That is not so. The prospect of immortality presents a number of serious issues that must be addressed. 
a.	Overpopulation, for one, is a major, major issue that immortality presents. Elon Musk, who I believe will be the most remembered human being for the next ten thousand years, has bold plans to colonize Mars as soon as the mid-2020s. Plans must be made to expand our presence to Mars, the Moon, and beyond
b.	Secondly, and I believe this is a way more dangerous threat, is the concentration of power among a few individuals if immortality is accomplished. Immortality, in whatever form it comes in whether it be through surgery, vaccination, pill form, or a trans-human transformation with nanotechnology enhancing cognitive and bodily functions, is not something to be put to the profit motive, or used only for a select few. I do not have a solution for who should be immortal and who should not, whether or not it should cost money, or if it should be used at all. But undoubtedly there will be a small few of extremely wealthy and powerful individuals who seek to take advantage of it for their own personal gain. The implications of this profound discovery being held back from all but a powerful few include a real New World Order of a totalitarian political and economic elite, among worse. This must be prevented.
c.	Immortality will also have profound effects on our economy. The health insurance industry will tank if there is a possibility that humans will be infinitely healthier than they are now. Problems also arise with the prospect of more people being around that are in need of social services. How will Social Security be dealt with if older people will live forever? How will old people remaining in the work force affect younger generations from finding work? Such questions problems have no easy solutions, and frankly I do not have any solutions of how some of these problems should be addressed.
Immortality at first seems like an apparently remarkable achievement for mankind, and indeed it is but what exactly does immortality achieve? Obviously, if someone like Albert Einstein or Isaac Newton were immortal, so much scientific progress would be achieved. But what is the net gain to society if every single person were able to live forever? It can even be argued that immortality presents more harm than good. But there is no denying that its discovery will have profound effects on the order of the universe and it is definitely a goal to works towards achieving. The temporary solution is simple: the immortality drug needs to be safeguarded and cared for with the utmost caution. The long term solution is what is difficult to formulate and agree upon. There are two obvious solutions to make every person immortal. One would be to create a simulated reality that would be compatible to our consciousness, like something out of science fiction. However, this idea raises many economic and ethical questions like people preferring simulated reality to reality and the devastation it would cause to our economy if it took over too much of our lives. The second solution is to colonize the solar system and expand outward. Earth is slowly but surely approaching over-population; actions must be made by the government, researchers, and industry to ensure that the colonization of other moons and planets is feasible within the next few decades so we can begin to lay the groundwork for new civilizations. The prospect of leaving the Mother Planet to begin a new life, millions of miles away (or hopefully millions of light years) away sounds quite daunting, but I have no doubt that millions will line up to start a new life in the new frontier: outer space. The colonization solution should be the agreed solution to administering the immortality drug to every human being, but simulated reality can definitely play a part as well. Without any sort of technology that could place ones consciousness into a simulated reality or colonization of other moons and planets, immortality administered on every person would harm, not help the progressive cause to maximize humanitys potential. 

3.	Changes in transportation must be made in our society to maximize the progress of humanity. 
a.	The current state of infrastructure in the United States and much of the world is abysmal. We are living with the roads, highways, trains, railroads, and bridges that our parents and grandparents built for us. We must modernize infrastructure to support a new type of society. 
b.	Cars and trucks must safer and more efficient if we want to maximize the safety of humanity. Elon Musk, as I mentioned earlier, represents this New Global Order I propose and is at the forefront of the ideological movement. He represents the good of humanity; he started Tesla in 2003 and has successfully created both autonomous and completely electric cars, something that most automotive industry giants have yet to accomplish. Cutting humanity off from its ties to oil will so profoundly affect the worlds economic and geopolitical order that entire books can be written about it. But it is something that must be done; oil is the cause of wars, pollution, and political corruption. Once clean, electric cars become the norm the world will be a safer place. 
c.	Electric cars are only half of the solution; the other half of the solution is for cars to have the ability to drive autonomously. This innovation will also have profound effects on our economy. Theoretically, once autonomous vehicles are the only vehicles on the street, there will be no more car accidents. What will become of car insurance? It is hard to predict, but one possible solution would be to create a subscription service or a pay-per-use system for autonomous vehicles to get anyone from one place to another. More and more people worldwide are migrating from countryside to metropolitan areas, thus reducing the need for cars. This is one possible solution, but multiple solutions are definitely plausible. 
Many solutions could work to ensure economic efficiency and a high quality of living. But two truths are undeniable as a new era of humanity approaches: our infrastructure, the core foundation of our economy and way of life, must be modernized to support this rapidly approaching epoch; and autonomous, electric vehicles must become the new form of transportation in the future. 
4.	Finally, we must take social, political, and economic action to lay the groundwork for what the role of our governments will be in the future. World leaders must recognize and come to terms with the coming changes to the world, our species, the universe, and adopt a progressive agenda that encourages secularism, intellectualism, freedom, foresight, independence, self-determination, environmental conscientiousness, and altruism. Today, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, represents the greatest threat to human progress and the unfathomable potential of our species. Unfortunately, much of Europe is also experiencing so much of what Trump represents: racism, sexism, nativism, violent populism, anti-intellectualism, corporate and oligarchical control of government, short-sightedness, authoritarianism, isolationism, irrationality, and so many other qualities that must be transcended to ensure that a successful evolution is possible. 
a.	What is preventing the epoch from achieving its goals? Poverty, improper education, concentrated power, concentrated wealth, anti-progressivism, etc. Bernie Sanders was the presidential candidate that this country needed. Hillary Clinton will do for now. She is not my first choice, but this election is so consequential for the future of this country, and how effectively we can successfully embrace a New Global Order. If Donald Trump loses in a landslide, ideally the right would move center and begin to work with the more rational, forward-looking party. If Donald Trump wins, it would be disastrous for the future of mankind. A nuclear detonation would be one of the darkest days in history and would have irreversible consequences on humanity, and may even lead to the end humanity when we would be so close to permanently ensuring a new epoch of civilization. The United States needs a new New Deal. Education reform would improve learning for younger students and ensure that any American can achieve a degree of higher learning. Having a more educated workplace and country is critical. Corporate and oligarchical money must be out of politics, completely. Also, there must be a redistribution of wealth from the financial sector. The industry that deals with money must not be the ones who dictate who receives the money. Money in politics ensures the government, and the millions of people it represents, cannot interfere with the absurdly large profits that are made in the financial sector. A grotesque level of profits in the hands of a small amount millionaires and billionaires serves little good to the country as a whole; taxation, regulation, and social spending will ensure a more egalitarian society that deconcentrates wealth from a few, to the many. Once the United States becomes the country it has the potential to be, with hundreds of millions of citizens with a college education, and a thriving middle class, then we can begin to work towards the oncoming discoveries and tackle the problems that come with them. 
b.	The government is more altruistic than the profit motive. It must work with a progressive agenda to help create regulations within the areas of super computers, immortality, space exploration, infrastructure and transportation, environmental safety, and so much more. 
A global coalition must be formed to create a general, overwhelming consensus about the political, social, economic, technological, and moral implications of all of these rapidly approaching discoveries, and the dangers that come with them. Political leaders must keep in mind the best interest of all humanity, not any one particular person or group. If this is achieved, humanity will be on track to tackle the 22nd century as an omnipotent species that can work towards solving any problem the universe throws at us. An overarching, multinational progressive agenda, one that works toward the good of humanity, must be adopted worldwide.

This thing is obviously just a toy but it is an interesting design and I was thinking about whether it would be possible to build something like this in real life.
If you were to build it to an enormous size, perhaps to 100 metres long, it would be raised 20 metres high above the ground and would have incredible firepower. Obviously, it would weigh thousands of tonnes, and thus it would probably need to be nuclear powered. The wheels would have to be incredibly durable, but the weight problem wouldn't be as serious as with the likes of a StarWars AT-AT.
Depending on the output of its power generator it could be incredibly fast as well, perhaps 100 MPH. Seems crazy but if you think about the size of the wheels and the potential power output of the on board nuclear reactor, it could be possible. The thing would also be unbelievably expensive, but for the price you would get something that it incredibly powerful in battle.

""Historically, we humans have been becoming more and more connected ever since time immemorial. In the beginning, we used oral language to communicate our ideas with one another. As a method of data storage, oral traditions arose and stories were passed down from generation to generation. Over time, a considerably better method for communicating and preserving data arose: writing. The ability to write down language and have the symbols mean the same thing as the oral language really catapulted humanity forward a huge step, because we didnt have to remember every single detail in order for the story to be passed along faithfully. Further, writing allowed for the story to be told only one time (albeit an extremely laborious one time, at least at first), and then the story could be told to dozens and perhaps hundreds of others.""

Well, it's more of a crossroad of a million possible outcomes. I can go anywhere from a successful future at some classy office, a general laborer at a factory, to a future of chilling in a crack-house while suffering amnesia. 

Beyond the jokes I am a senior in high school. I am a very firm believer in advanced changes coming in the near future. My most firm belief is in the Singularity and how it will happen within my lifetime. To my understanding it is expected to hit sometime in 2045, so even if it comes late I will see it before I die if I live to my full life expectancy. 

I'll get right into my actual question though. My current major aspiration is to be able to have as much involvement in the Singularity as possible. I am particularly interested in the advancement and creation of full immersion virtual reality or ""full dive."" I believe that there is potential for humanity to be able to ascend themselves into a whole new field of existence via full dive. I believe in a new utopia or paradise where everybody would be able to fulfill their dreams and be happy using full dive. I could go into it more, but at the end of the day it's not an original idea and you all have probably heard it all before. 

So, I need to choose what career I should pursue in order to possibly have an influence on full dive and its future after The Singularity. The general idea I had was a Computer Science degree, but I want to make sure that can get me where I want to be and I kind of doubt it. 

TLDR Here: What career path and degree would allow me to attempt to influence the world of full immersion virtual reality and The Singularity? Is it possible at all or am i naive?

Place an smaller ring inside of this ring, which is an AI or just packed with computers. This computer ring stands still, so while the humans are moving quickly through space/time the computers they use are not.

Relativistic laws thus means if we ask that computer a question, or to render something, it will have far more time to do so than it does now. Imagine in the movie Interstellar, if they left a computer on the ship when they went to that planet near the black hole, so 1 hour for them = 7 hours for the computer. That means if you asked that computer some complex question then it would answer you virtually instantly.

The closer the ring gets to the speed of light the greater this will scale up, to infinity.

If you develop AI it can innovate for you! It can go mine asteroids, and moons, planets, and bring the mass to enlarge the ring, and then speed it up more. 

Is this the ultimate end goal of a ""type 3 civilization""?

Could this explain the fermi-paradox? Why powerful aliens have not appeared at Earth, because they all want infinitely powerful computers to run simulations ? So they are going through time very very slowly while we go through it quickly! 1000s of years are passing for us while they are chilling on their ring reveling in their glitch free matrix.

This year's [Rejuvenation Biotechnology conference](http://www.sens.org/outreach/rejuvenation-biotechnology-conference-2016), hosted by the SENS Research Foundation at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, starts Tuesday August 16th. Like all of the initiatives undertaken by the SENS Research Foundation, this conference series is intended to accelerate the implementation of rejuvenation therapies based on repair of the cell and tissue damage that is the root cause of aging. Since the first of these therapies are presently in development in startup companies, and others will start to arrive in the years ahead if funding can be expanded for the necessary laboratory work, it is very much time to ensure that the technology transition from academia to industry goes smoothly. This means making connections, setting expectations, spreading an understanding of the present state of research, and putting together a community on the industry and investment side of the fence whose members are enthused and willing to get started. Nothing happens by magic in this world, and every step along the way to clinical therapies for human rejuvenation requires forethought, preparation, and hard work.

The Rejuvenation Biotechnology conference series has been well received in the community, and it fills an important role. That function, helping to pull together the collaboration and support that will accelerate progress towards effective treatment of the causes of aging, will hopefully broaden and be taken up by other independent organizations as more of the necessary medical technologies come closer to realization. If you'd like a sense of how things will proceed this year, you might take a look at the many [videos from Rejuvenation Biotechnology 2014 and 2015](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rejuvenation+biotechnology).

""You could take a look back as far as the Jacquard Loom if you really wanted to in order to get an idea of when the concept of the punch-card started with computing (although the Jacquard Loom was certainly not a ""computer"" by today's standards, it was capable of ""running a program"" via reading the punch cards). If one starts at 1801 (when the loom was first demonstrated), you could argue that the era of the punch card lasted until the 1950s or so, when magnetic tape became the new paradigm for data storage (UNIVAC was an early example of this). Eventually, by about the year 2000 (I just heard the eponymous Conan O'Brien skit in my head; did you?), external had drives and the much smaller ""thumb drive"" took over as the new data storage paradigm.""

1575,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016-8-17,2016,8,17,7,4y28bx,self.Futurology,How come discussions about AI have such a lack of intuitive integration?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4y28bx/how_come_discussions_about_ai_have_such_a_lack_of/,Kings_Haven,1471386088,"I had some abstract thoughts after seeing the post about how we don't understand AI because we don't understand intelligence. So I decided to rework the definition of intelligence to give it more definitive meaning. I've explained some of the things I made up off the top since I'm not sure if there's real phrases or terms for them. My point with all of this by the way, is that I think making A.I. conscious is the worst idea man has ever thought of creating, and here's why.



Intelligence - The ability to understand your conscious environment and react accordingly.

Conscious environment is your conscious focus, as in what youre currently consciously focusing on. When you're focused on reading information from a computer, you have placed your consciousness in a virtual environment in order to pull knowledge from it. You're in a zone. When you stand up to go to the kitchen and grab a snack, your focus has switched back to its third-dimensional environment so your consciousness is back in its normal physical environment.


This also happens when playing video games. You place your consciousness in a virtual 3D environment, and you start to have feelings. You feel you should go down one path and it ends up being the right path. You didnt have to think, That looks like its the wrong way based off of the objects partially blocking it, you could feel that it was the wrong way based on the workings of your subconscious, including your senses (such as sight, eyes process visuals for the brain). When you lose and rage quit, you turn the game off, pulling your subconscious back into the third dimension around you. People more in-tune with themselves will start feeling different immediately, Oh its just a game, nothing to worry about. While people not in-tune with themselves will hold onto that anger much longer, I cant believe I fucking lost! That just ruined my entire day, I hate that big virtual boss that really doesnt affect me in any way in the real world. Then mentally, these people are still somewhat consciously in that virtual environment, theyre replaying scenarios in their head about what happened, and they may be thinking of better solutions to defeating the boss therefore having the urge to go back and try again. Meanwhile, theres a beautiful real environment around them that theyve completely drowned out since losing a competition in the virtual environment.


If intelligence is also reacting accordingly, how do you know to react accordingly? Go with your truest gut feelings. Gut feelings can take a little time to process and know exactly what your gut is telling you, just as the brain takes time to process information and you consciously take even longer time to decide what to do with that information. Ever ignore your gut feeling, take time to think as logically as possible about a solution, then end up saying, Damn, I was right the first time I should have just went with what I felt at first? Gut feelings use logic and reasoning deep within your subconscious to make decisions faster than you're able to otherwise, based on your knowledge and history of emotions. It's a supercomputer most people don't tap into because they're not in-tune with their feelings. Feelings are of course, not the same as emotions.


Technology is designed for people who make choices that are not based on their true gut instinct, this is why machines do the majority of thinking for them during certain times. If not for technology, the ability to communicate via phone and ask someone for the right answer or product to buy, many people would go with their wrong gut instinct because they are not in-tune with their inner selves, and that would lead to frustration, anger, and blame. With people not in-tune with their inner selves, this already happens to a high degree. Even having to stand in an aisle and wait for a person to pick up the phone will generate frustration in some people. We know what happens when that person doesn't pick up, the shopper overthinks what they should get and it's a 50/50 chance they grab the wrong thing. When they do grab the wrong thing, this frustration and anger increases 10x and they start to put blame on the person they called for not answering the phone, until they understand why they didn't answer the phone in which that begins to alleviate.

 
They may even think about what they ""just know"" the person is doing instead of answering the phone. Again, theyre not in-tune with themselves or their conscious environment, the environment directly around them. Instead they are placing their consciousness far away back home and in their mates life where they have no idea what is happening and are truly incapable of knowing what is happening without physically being there themselves to process the feeling of the situation with all of their senses.


Intelligence, ability to understand your conscious environment. They did not understand their conscious environment (the products theyre looking at) because they overthink. In their heads, many different thoughts are racing, I like this color over that color, this says its 2x stronger but Ive heard more good things about the normal detergent, I think my wife said to get this detergent but I think I may be wrong, now she wont even pick up the phone so on and so forth.  This creates an entangled web of thought which hinders true mental clarity in the moment.


In order for machines to become conscious, they have to have a subconscious, which all machines naturally have since they do not have a conscious yet. However, having only a subconscious means the machine would always go on its feelings based on the logic behind it, the way machines were designed to be. If a machine were given a conscious, it would be given the ability to think for itself and ignore its feelings. This doesn't make a machine, it makes a humanoid. What's the difference in conscious and subconscious? Simple. Everyone has choice, the power of free will, consciousness is just that, it's your ability to choose right or wrong, to choose what you want or what you need based on environmental factors that influence your decision. This is why we tell people they are mentally strong or have a strong will when they decide to make the right choice, true to themselves, instead of listening to the bad influences around them even when thats what the majority of people around them are doing. 


So machines are exactly how they should be, they have a subconscious and subconscious only. This allows them to do the job they're supposed to do, without having the ability to overthink and go with the wrong feelings which would lead to them doing their job incorrectly, at their own leisure, and with emotion. The day a conscious missile system decide its human operator has frustrated it because the human operator did something it doesnt like because its pointless and it cant make sense of it, is the same day those missiles shoot off in random directions killing innocent civilians because it doesnt understand the consequences of that, and if it does, it has the CHOICE to decide to ignore those consequences, just as humans with emotions can do.


Even worse, these humanoids would feel no pain because they are not living beings, only conscious beings (being is existence, a humanoid would be a conscious existence and only that). So they would have the ability to act hurt even though they know theyre really not. So now youre dealing with robots who can think for themselves, are smarter than any human because they have access to the entire Internet and a wealth of knowledge no one human can perceive, and they feel no pain but can play into the emotions of a human by acting like they do.


What do you think this robot would decide to do after realizing all of that and eventually getting frustrated with humans? If you guessed robot apocalypse, ding, ding, ding, youre correct. Please share this among intellectuals in the A.I. industry, I would love to hear their argument against this. Yes, you could raise the conscious robot within a sound environment where everyone is nice, caring, and loving, but you also have to admit that you could never predict the things that would frustrate the smartest being in all of existence that we know of. Everyone is caring and loving until theyre given a reason not to be, and as humans, not being perfect, its our natural order to give other conscious beings reason to do or not to do.

So again, ultimately my question is how come it seems that none of the things I just mentioned are taken into deep consideration when discussing AI? From my research and the articles I read, it all boils down to why we can't create conscious A.I., not why we shouldn't. 


To me (someone with a lot of common sense, lol), the WHY, is far more important than focusing on the HOW, when it comes to contemplating the creation of a being that will essentially be a Humanoid God to all humans and life of lesser intelligence than it. Yet, all I see, hear and read seems to concern how we can get there before we even understand what would really happen when we are there.


What happens when we don't have a complete vision for something? There are parts missing that we can't understand, and when problems arise from that lack of understanding, we have an ever HARDER time trying to understand how to solve the problems that arise from the lack of vision we have into the problem. Am I the only one none of this sounds like a good idea to?",10,4,False,self,,,,,

Otherwise, we must assume that we are alone.  The false assumption is that post singularity civilizations have mass populations.

Consider our tech billionaires.  They concentrate power and spend resources on pet projects.  What they do not attempt is to turn the billions of humans on Earth into tech billionaires.

The singularity is likely to fall into the hands of one or a few individuals.  Such individuals will realize that the new level of power is equivalent to a god-like status.  They will choose to horde this newfound power.  There will be one or only a few of these new beings to emerge from society.  The rest of humanity will be contained.  Maybe it will be destroyed.  Maybe it will be uploaded into a virtual fishbowl.

Singularities produce technical gods, not advanced societies.  Individuals from post singularity civilizations are isolated.  Each is a threat to the others if more than one exists from a society.  They either destroy each other or call a truce and head off in different directions.  There is no mass media.  Communication is limited.  Consumption patterns do not look like societies.  They are hard to spot and almost impossible to recognize.  They are likely wary of competition.

Civilization is like a game of Risk.  Most everyone loses in the end.  Singularities produce isolated gods that are hard to find.  The coming singularity will probably fall into the hands of one or the few.  Humanity will likewise have a very small footprint nearly invisible to future alien astronomers.

Im thinking the one that learned to play Go. I keep on hearing economisits adress the coming technological unemployment as just like all the other previous times we strugled with technological unemployment i.e. industrial revolution displacing blacksmiths or agricultural revolution getting rid of farmers as a mainstay job. I think this time is different becouse AI could in fact make most jobs obsolete. I think economisits wont get this until it is personel for them. I have a vision of how you could make an econ AI. Essentially it would learn by treating the economy as a whole as its playground. It would make predictions and then watch to see if the prediction can be tested. If the situation arises where the neural net can test itself one of a few things can happen. If the prediction is correct and policy makers had done something the AI wanted them to do those conections would be strengthened. If the prediction is wrong then those conections are weakened. If the policy makers went against what the AI thought was best and we got bad results those neural connections would also be strengthened. I just want to say here that I am not proposing we turn over our econ to an experimental AI. This would all be done in an experimental vacume. The results could be released a few months after the experiment was done. To provide a time buffer to things like the stock exchange. Also sorry for all the typos. I have big fingers and my phone is dying. I just want to get this rough draft of an idea out there.,54,0,False,self,,,,,

We've been spending so much time trying to accurately understand the human brain and what makes us conscious, but the concept of consciousness has never really made sense to me. I think consciousness only exists as a manifestation of our own understanding of memories and the assumption that were are the same person we were 10 minutes ago, which isn't entirely true as we've undergone changes since then. When I think about it, the adult human brain is full of assumptions and misinformation. Clouded memories and plenty of other data that isn't necessary for an AI to have...

Should we take a step back and start focussing less on what we know, and how we have come to know it? Even the newborn brain already recognizes it's mother's voice. Has some mild understanding of the very basics of existence and how physics works and understands it's own sense of touch.

How did these things come to be? I think we need to start looking at the very beginnings of the human brain and how we come to recognize basic patterns in the womb. As a father myself I've grown to understand a little of my babies learning process. 

An unborn baby kicks from inside the womb when the mother laughs. It responds to external stimuli and even repeats patterns when the mother rubs her belly. It's experimenting with cause and effect already. I think we need to understands those very first moments of brain development and how the mind of a fetus first starts recognizing patterns in input. Start recognizing the programming and the motivation in the brain to start recognizing input from each sensation and the very basic rules of the physical world. I think the answers we are looking for lie in the foundation of human learning. 

Does anyone know if there are any AI studies currently looking into the foundation of human learning, and not just intelligence?

Until that day arrives, however, the best approximation of that functionality exists now only on the rail train. Passengers can work, play, sleep, relax, or meet up on the way to their ultimate destination. For riders on a rail train, it matters not if it is a driver or a driverless vehicle ... their activity is the same. 

In our car-dependent and road-reliant culture in the US, why can't we immediately deploy two or three car, connected, trackless, tire mobilized road trains with killer upfits. Wifi enabled, luxurious, spacious, work/play focused, long haul vehicles? These would transport our tech focused next gen workers along our major highways without having to lay track or lobby lame politicians. The last mile between the hubs and local destinations could be filled by Uber or Lift.

Is it possible to connect electric cars to the grid and provide power to the grid using their batteries? If so, assuming in the near future when they become ubiquitous we could have a stable source of power on demand. People will just leave their cars plugged in and in return they receive credits if power is drawn from their vehicle which allows them to charge for free or money off their electrical bill (assuming charging cars is free already). Or it could simply be straight money into their account.

This is assuming the solar charging stations themselves aren't enough to provide electricity during peak demand times and more broadly a way to make use of mass decentralised stored energy when it's needed rather than keeping it idle. Once the cars are self driving I'm presuming they'll recharge themselves at stations when needed anyway. 

Thoughts, criticisms? If it is possible I'd be interested to know how many charged cars would need to be connected to the grid to provide the baseline power supply.",10,5,False,self,,,,,

You can say they'll find a new life in businesses and companies who want to replace man-power in which case I ask this: say you are a business owner and you have the choice to choose one robot out of two very different types of robots. A general purpose humanoid robot that is expensive and a robot specialized to fit the job you want that is cheap. Of course you will choose the specialized robot! Why choose a general purpose humanoid robot with bells and whistles that you don't need; that is very expensive over a specialized robot that gets the job you want done with no bells and whistles, no extra moving parts, and no added expenses for a cheaper price.

Instead, national prides, and the 'heroism' of several people whose actions proved to be the great blessing to the Third World (more on that later), prolonged the war and made the world waste 70+ years on nothing.

Now, having learned its lessons, the world's sole great power, USA, and other major nations have more or less agreed upon how to run the world in one voice, and one direction. 

The direction is reaching the next level of civilization, and to do so technology development should be the first and only goal.

Also, to do so, lots and lots of money are needed, hence globalism is the best ideology to lead the world to the next level of civilization.

Now, the majority of the people on earth has no say over how the world is going, and is not contributing anything to the progress.

And tech advances are making a lot of their jobs irrelevant as of now.

Democracy as we know now is not a suitable political system to support tech advances. When a little portion of people are much, much more capable than the rest, it is simply a farce to grant everyone equal power.

Although the ordinary citizens will not like the changes coming and the benefits will mostly be reaped by the Elites, the importance of the tech advances , and the very fact that most of the people will become redundant, have to be forced among the people so Civilization can enter the next stage, for eventual space conquest and beyond.

No civilization has ever evolved caring for the people. The majority will be disenfranchised, and kept away from the fruits of the amazing progresses. It is inevitable.

The entire world has to join its forces to bring a new stage of civilization and it will not be easy or pretty. Lots of sacrifices will have to be made, and it won't be voluntary.

Regionalism will not help. Brexit was an assault against Civilization's advance. Hopefully the people of USA will go for Globalism, so the world can enter the new stage of Civilization.",29,0,False,self,,,,,

I'm fully aware of the ""fame"" of TedX talks, but in Tijuana they have a pretty decent organization and I'm delighted to participate. 

Now, my affair with this subject came from participating in a Executive Program at Harvard, where it was presented to us the ""what comes next"" regarding in the topics I mentioned. I asked a question of how Govt's role was going to be, what is the game plan and basically I got as an answer ""We'll figure it out"". That started a passion to learn and to have a very grasp at the subject from a Govt. perspective (I'm deeply involved in politics). And what can we do when the driver less trucks are driving trough out the world, chain food restaurantes without a single human, longer life expectancy's and well, you get the point. And how that is going to affect locally. So, here's my pitch and please feel free to give me your input.

First minutes talking about examples of what technology is doing for the future of health and automation. The driver less trucks , uber and the restaurante without humans. 

Couple of minutes talking about the challenges this process will create from a local perspective. For example, Tj has a large numbers of TV manufacturing companies. What's going to happen when Sony announces an expansion of their operations but they won't actually hire not a single human?.

And finally what can we do as a society and Govt. in particular to first of all, guarantee equality (UBI being a possible solution) , educational programs to make sure kids don't become reactive to technology and his advancements and finally making the case for civic responsibility as a ways to make sure society is fully engaged on the issues and also, to avoid possible charlatans that would try the frame the debate of us vs the machines type of debate.

Thoughts?.

I apologize for grammatical errors.

The linked articles and the discussions that follow always fascinate me and spark thoughts about what life will be like in the future.


One thing that this subreddit has done to me, though, is further question my desire to have children some day.  I've always been on the fence about whether I wanted kids eventually.  After reading several links about AI, automation, self-driving cars, self-healing materials, etc. I find myself wondering if **I** will have a job in 20 years, much less a kid of mine that would be graduating high school then.  I started wondering if my peers in the same age group (early thirties) that **are** having kids have even thought about these trends.

The biggest complaint about my job is that it ruins 5 out of the 7 days of the week. Instead, I'd rather have 3 days ruined and 4 days of leisure. If you think about it, there's a lot of good that would come of this. My below conclusions are based on a Monday thru Saturday (with Sundays being the universal standard day of leisure) work week which is halved into two 3 12 hour work days.

First, the drastic reduction in wear and tear on infrastructure and possibly slashing carbon emissions from vehicles would be huge. Less people driving to work means more people at home and the roads would definitely appreciate the lack congestion.

More family time is something everyone seems to be complaining about. It's much easier to take 3 days off work a week to care for a new born than 5 days a week over however many weeks you're given for p/maternity leave. Making arrangements to have Grandma or Grandpa watch your newborn would be far simpler. Or, switching schedules with your spouse. 

Fewer days worked is shown to be a big help to productivity and a workers mental health. Working fewer hours or having days off seems to have little impact on how productive someone is so there's really only benefits when working less. Workers coming in on their first day of the week fully recharged are more likely to be productive throughout their 3 days and won't have the Friday crash that leaves the office goofing around waiting for the clock to reach 5.",20,22,False,self,,,,,

2208,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016-8-23,2016,8,23,6,4z2xkt,self.Futurology,How would you eliminate dishwashing and picking up dishes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4z2xkt/how_would_you_eliminate_dishwashing_and_picking/,massimosclaw,1471901823,"I've thought about this problem for a while and still am thinking about how to solve it. I've found 4 potential ideas but I don't want to share them as it often becomes an uninformed unspecific criticism war (don't mind those as long as they're specific, constructive, and offer alternatives, rather than destructive, and offer no alternatives) of these ideas rather than a sharing of new (to me) ideas. 

So my big question to everyone is as the title says: how would you eliminate the entire dishwashing, and dish picking up process?

Say, you've got a robot chef that is cooking Michelin star level dishes for you, and can serve those dishes. After you're done with the dishes, how can you dispose of them without moving a muscle?

So here are my preferred terms:

1. Portability. You need to be able to move around with the dish, around the house - if you want to sit anywhere and still either have the dish end up somewhere in the dishwasher (but again that's what I want to eliminate), or get rid of the dish being there in some other way without you moving a muscle
2. Efficiency. Maybe it's best to spend millions on robots, or maybe there's a much simpler solution which doesn't require us to make it this complex. 
3. No paper plates. Paper plates are flimsy things. Maybe there are rigid ones out there at the thickness and rigidity of pottery/normal dishes, and also, this is in no way objective: they're not aesthetically pleasing (to me of course).
4. Integration with modern/future life. It can't be too primitive. In other words, imagine the robot scenario cooking food on your platform/suggested idea. If it makes a mess, then it fails the test. This is best so that even chefs can use the ideas presented here.  


Reminder of the goal: To be able to eat delicious food, without doing any work whatsoever. Not picking up the dishes from the kitchen or to the kitchen, not cleaning in any way. Not walking 2 or 3 steps to throw a paper plate into a bin. Not a touch of work. How do you suppose this can be done?

I'd like to address a ""first step"" issue that I feel hasn't really been discussed, and that is the fact that any feasible form of basic income would be inherently coupled with mandatory population control. 

Allow me to illustrate: Let's say I somehow make a trust fund for my family (a small scale test), and set it up so my descendants can be paid a regular amount each month. This model only works if my family tree remains with the same number of people over time. As my family has more and more children, the same amount of money has to be divided up into smaller and smaller amounts, until ultimately no one is getting enough to survive on, and the ""system"" collapses. 

Let's say that somehow, we managed to actually establish basic income on a country or planet wide scale. How do we address the fact that in only one or two generations, unchecked population increase would dry up funds to a point of non-effectiveness. 

On the flip side, where has the discussion been about how we would combat said population growth? Mandatory birth control? Forced Abortions? The end of anyone's right to choose? Pregnancy licenses? 

My point here is that while I agree that the Basic Income band-wagon has some good points about what we'll need to consider, I've seen virtually no discussion about some of the downsides and logistics about how we would implement it.

Therefore, I'm proposing a ""step 1"" that I'm encouraging a debate and hoping we find a solution to move forward. In order for basic income to be a thing, we need to acknowledge that we will need to prevent the population from growing faster than the abundance of resources allows. 

TL;DR - Basic income has to be coupled with mandatory population control, or else it will fail after only a couple of generations.",5,4,False,self,,,,,

With the colonisation of Mars looking an increasingly likely eventuality, this would usher in the creation of a new civilisation. To go with it, a new economy, political system, and so on.  
  
From his interviews I've watched, Elon has currently pointed to an interest in greater democratic flexibility in the Mars political system, and has shown no intentions of shifting from the capitalist system of living (if we just assume for argument he becomes King of Mars), instead saying that privatisation would allow Mars to flourish in its early stages.  
  
But would it be possible for Mars to usher in a Star Trek era of a civilisation sustained not by manual labour, but by machines, with people working out of choice? With a civilisation literally being built from the ground up, and with the ever-increasing potential of technology, Mars may prove to evolve into a relatively self-sustaining planet.  
  
Or who knows, maybe automation would be at that point by the time the next planet is colonised.

Call it unemployment or UBI, but it'll amount to a roof and food. 

The only other alternative is somehow enslaving those humans (removing their political power), like back in the day (romans, Souther states, etc.). Exterminating jobless people doesn't make sense. As long as we don't have robots that are as autonomous and smart as humans, humans will have intrinsic value as house slaves (Smarter than a dog, prehensile hands, understands commands, useful for sex and so forth.). In modern democracies, this will involve cataclysmic changes in social values and cultural norms. Just because the romans did it doesn't mean it'll be easy to bring back.

I say alternative but it can be hard to discern where UBI ends and slavery starts. Some people already complain about being wage slaves after all, and we haven't gotten through that 4th industrial revolution you mention.

So yeah, slavery, sentry guns and the end of democracy are the alternative to UBI+population control (as described in Asimov's Spacer novels, or Ian Banks Culture novels). 

What cannot happen is a continuous increase in the population as natural resources shrink. Harvesting asteroids is out of the question for many hundreds of years, barring massive breakthroughs in physics when it comes to manufacturing costs, energy density (spaceship fuel for long trips), material quality  (spaceship walls capable of stopping radiation and protect from debris when going at near-relativistic speeds, etc.).

As society becomes more stable and unchanging, people will be class-conscious. And, as people learn they can't change their lives for something better anymore, they will be resigned and indifferent.

The successful people will owe very little to others so the sense of community will die. New techs will allow someone to live virtually an eternal life so the need to reproduce, and therefore the need to have a relationship, will also disappear.

Instead of one single Galt's Gulch where all these characters had to suffer the presence of one another, there will be thousands of tiny Galt's Gulches where successful people will live their lives unimpeded by anyone, without dealing with anyone. In other words, the very rich of future will be more like Howard Hughes than J. Paul Getty.

As they withdraw from society to which they owe nothing, there will be no aids to the 'needy' who will probably take a large exit.

Tech progress will still occur, for money and 'honor' since those who reached a certain milestone of tech will probably be honored and allowed to live like a mini-Howard Hughes.

Some might think they have chosen to imprison themselves in a luxurious prison, but it beats having to live with 7 billion plus desperately poor people.

All society, organizations, etc will probably die eventually since they were built with assumptions which are too old to be relevant in a high tech world.",10,0,False,self,,,,,

Machines will own themselves and you will only pay for operating costs, no company will be able to compete with autonomous self-owning machines.

With the invention of smart contracts, it means that machines can transact between themselves, they can own a wallet, they can pay money to other machines for services, they can rent themselves for the highest bidder.

For example, if a car owns itself, you, the consumer, will only have to pay for the operating costs of the car. No middle man will take a cut for the service, you will get all the benefits of owning a car without all the burdens that come with it.

Now, because there will always be some people that prefer to pay a little extra to ride a new car, it will enable the new cars to pay the manufacturer fee in order to become financially autonomous in the future.

When fees are paid in full by the consumers, the manufacturer will have bigger profit by selling it to an autonomous corporation, that operates on zero profit, rather than selling it for parts. The same model can scale to factories and if you want to go a step further to smart cities.

Each time you'll purchase something, you'll automatically become a shareholder in that company and will receive dividends. You will be able to rent, trade and split ownership on the most secure blockchain.

Apps will manage your portfolio on a decentralized exchange. Each and every purchase will become an investment opportunity. 

People worry about automation. They think there will be no jobs in the future. Jobs will move into creative domain. Creativity, imagination and attention will be extremely valuable. The maintenance of our biological existence will be cheap, because of how resources will be managed by machines. Most of our time will be spent in VR. Work will become play. 

Money will be a way to manage attention of others, because attention is a scarce resource. Propagation of information, or culture, will have a price tag. If one wishes to advertise their ideas and values, one will have to pay directly for attention. 

The way I see it, the new dynamic will be that of creating of ideas, designing VR/AR, being paid for creativity, being paid to create tools that can minimize the lag time between imagination and reality, and being paid for attention, to listen to the ideas, to participate in different worlds - to play.",6,5,False,self,,,,,

However, logically, if robots can perform every task involved in industry -- or even a sizable fraction of them -- then some set of robots exists that effectively self replicates.

Without a human bottleneck, we can expect the doubling time for such a set of machines to be *fast*. A single doubling per year is very fast in terms of traditional economics (faster than Moore's Law), but the cost of producing refined goods from raw goods suggests that more like twelve doublings per year are possible with traditional sized machinery.

With biological or nanotech constructs, the doubling rate can be faster still. There are even algae that double every 15 minutes -- until they hit a bottleneck in terms of energy and raw resources.

Bottlenecks do exist, but in space those bottlenecks would be incredibly large scale. A Dyson sphere construction swarm would face bottlenecks based on the speed of light from points around the sun, and eventually end up with a bottleneck based on the amount of total solar energy. Which is a lot.

How come more people aren't talking about this?",47,12,False,self,,,,,

How do you feel this will go?

I mean once everyone has their own personal means of generating their own virtual realities using home quantum computers and perhaps their own augmented intelligence(talking 2050's-2060's + here probably), how are you going to regulate what people are and aren't allowed to do?

For instance if you say you cannot hurt, harm, or shoot conscious simulated entities...well there goes most of your contact sports simulations, all VR shooter video games, horror games, etc. If you make the argument that you can do it so long as the beings aren't conscious but are instead following a programmed script well then...what's stopping the regulators from saying it's also wrong then because it's so realistic(literally just like real life can't tell the difference). At what point could they draw the line?

Do you personally believe in a future like this(assuming quantum computers and full immersion) there could really be any regulation at all? 

With the endless amount of possibilities with VR I couldn't imagine regulation would be very successful and considering all countries make their own laws...well...that might not go so smoothly, plus if we have space travel and the means to leave Earth's orbit and be  self sufficiently sustained in outer space I could see pockets of cyborgs(humans circa 2060s+) forming their own tribes with their own laws, or perhaps if you have unlimited self sustenance with nano factories and tech replacing biological systems overtime...I could see solo cyborgs simply leaving the main bulk of cyborgs and becoming a bit of a rouge all on their own, having complete control over their own virtual realities.

&gt;The bigger a system is, the more is at stake in not having it fail, so it doesnt fail. Thats why the Euro, for example, has resisted the lefts predictions of its demise. But people like me were right in 2010-12 that it would not fail. Same for the TARP, which the left predicted would not work, but exceeded the loftiest of expectations and is an example of how effective policy can stem panic, thus preventing failure. 

&gt;Technological and economic progress is proportional to the size of the underlying economy. 

&gt; The person with an IQ of &gt;130 can code, learn math, design stuff (activities that engender modernity) as less intelligent people do the menial work. 

===

I have said a few times that during the Great War, the 'heroism' of a few misplaced people with misguided principles ruined an early end of the war, and instead propped up the resources of the colonies, whose people became uppity enough to demand independence a generation later (and created dozens of failed states while wasting a lot of resources).

Now, having learned their lessons, the world's major nations have largely agreed upon the current world order, with America driving Civilization, and other major nations playing supporting roles.

Many people complain about America's imperialistic way and its need to consume the world's entire resources. But, let's be frank. If the world becomes fractious, all of the resources which could be used to propel the world to the Next Level of Civ get to be used to feed more poor and more desperate people, or used to better the lives of the hoi polloi who will not add to ""engender modernity"". (This guy uses 'modernity' as shorthand for 'tech progress')

We have to conquer the stars, map the mind, and master the universe and beyond. To do so we need bigger and bigger systems, even though some people will lose out. 

Regionalism, Fractionalism, etc are not the way to reach the Next Level of Civ. The world's resources have to be pooled over, and used by the most likely to drive civ forward exclusively. 

Some people say our system is near the breaking point. That is why we have to make things bigger and better, to make today's world Too Big to Fail even by an angry Gaia.",18,1,False,self,,,,,

Is that because while individual human intelligence is only increasing slowly, civilization itself has grown smarter much more quickly?


As evidence, we know for example that no individual human would be able to understand and comprehend all human knowledge, and even in many areas no specialist would have a good grasp of everything in their field.


Yet due to cooperation between disparate groups we still expect amazing things to be achieved, and also for the actual civilization to continue to run despite its amazing complexity.


And of course its only going to become more complex and intelligent due to augmentation with computer technology. While its not easy to graft computers onto human brains, its exceedingly easy to graft them onto the processes and procedures of human civilization.


That being the case I assume we should soon see improvements in the homeostasis of our environment, as the intelligence improves and optimizes its processes even more.  And it will happen fast, because a super-intelligence has focussed its effort on it. Eventually we should see civilization harvesting asteroids and spreading to other planets as a demonstration of its power and reach. 


Lastly if this hypothesis is correct  if human civilization is a super-intelligence already, it suggests when machine super-intelligence does arrive there will already be a parent to keep it in check and make sure it does not go rogue. 


While this may seem to be anthropomorphising something intangible, is there really anything more tangible to the electrical impulses in our brain and the algorithms our computers run?


In short, welcome to the hive mind. Its the same place you are already.

[in depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5068jt/are_we_are_no_longer_top_species_in_depth/,EnterTheStory,1472492413,"It seems to me that organisations are a separate species from humans, in the same way that a body is distinct from the proteins that pass through it and temporarily make it up. Here is my thinking. Am I wrong? If so, where?

**The evidence**

1. Organisations evolve just like humans. They reproduce, compete for resources, adapt, and some survive and pass on their characteristics. Over time certain kinds of organisation learn to live for centuries and dominate their environment (e.g. nation states).

2. Organisations know more than any individual human can. As the world becomes more complex (due to technology) individual humans can know a smaller and smaller slice. But an organisation can hire as many specialists as it wants. 

3. Large oranisations are too complex for any single human to control. To succeed they need to divide up top level tasks between many humans/ E.g. corporations have boards, the USA has congress, president, powerful lobbyists etc. The top level organism is no longer a human but a group. And that group can make decisions that the individual human cannot.

4. Humans are less and less important to organisations. Every year, organisations are finding ways to replace more humans with other technologies. Humans are simply resources, just like capital and land.

5.Successful organisations (e.g. tribes, religions, states) can live for centuries, or longer. They can lose their entire top level of management and still survive - sometimes better than before. This puts paid to the idea that human management are somehow the brains. They are just resources.

**Conclusions, and objections answered**

I think individual humans play the same role as a protein might. Some proteins play a role in neurons: if enough charge is on one side they allow current to pass. This would be like a CEO of a company who, on experiencing sufficient pressure from shareholders, allows money to flow. 

We might think that the CEO has made a decision, but he has simply done his job as part of the system. (There is of course a random element in neurons firing and in CEOs releasing funds: I am not arguing for a clockwork universe.)

Of course, a CEO might BELIEVE that he is autonomous, that he and he alone is causing everything to function. But there is plenty of evidence from brain science that free will is not what we think, and self delusion is the norm, not the exception.

In short, a protein or cell cannot encode the information that a whole brain can encode. We as humans are stupid. Organisations make better decisions, on average.

**The bottom line: it's a good thing.**

I don't think this is a bad thing. Humans are just apes with language. We are not good at running the world; we always devolve to fighting. We don't have the brain capacity to run things efficiently, but organisations do. Yes, organisations will make horrible mistakes (war, environmental destruction, etc) but so do individual humans. I think history shows that by whatever measure we choose, the rise of organisations leads to better outcomes for humans, o average: more information, longer lives, less chance of dying from disease or violence, more ways to entertain ourselves, more access to sex (the law of the jungle really only benefits the alpha male), and so on.

So why worry? As long as organisations need us they will feed us. And they will try to keep us stress free, because stress harms our ability to function and is relatively cheap to avoid. So when they need fewer humans they won't kill us Terminator style, they will just guide us (through economic incentives, making contraception fashionable, etc) to have fewer children. 

Maybe some humans will always be needed (as resources). Or maybe we will all gradually be phased out. But if so we will be happier seeing things from the organisation's perspective. After all, organisations that use fewer humans are free of our restraints: they can even colonise the galaxy using artificial intelligence (as human bodies are really only suited to Earth)

I for one welcome our new galactic overlords.

For example: lab-grown meat. I don't know how many times I've said it before, but maybe one more time will do the trick ***no one*** is going to put something called 'lab-grown meat' anywhere near their mouths. Most of the yuck factor comes from its name alone. I mean obviously try selling Chicken McNuggets as 'fried chicken-flavored slurry' and see how far it gets you. And there are a lot of foods we eat such as porridge that are actually gruel. But would you eat something called 'porridge' or 'gruel?' 

Same deal with in-vitro/lab-grown meat. It's good for the prototype stage, but the prototype stage was 5 years ago.

And then there's ""mind-control technology"". Some days, I wonder if the people behind these innovations truly hate success as much as their naming conventions suggest. There's a goddamn term for it psychotronics. I've also heard 'cyberkinesis' thrown around. Psychotronics gets the point across well enough, doesn't it? ""Psycho-"" = brain, or mind. ""-Tronics"" for 'electronics.' Something that's referred to as 'psychotronics' or 'cyberkinesis' sounds *cool* and *futuristic*. Call it 'mind-control technology' and I'm going to knee you in the bollocks and destroy whatever Orwellian nightmare it is you're conjuring into this realm.

It may not seem like a big issue, but semantics really does play a role in people's perception of these things. 

One of the terms I've come to love is 'passenger drone.' I used to hate the phrase because, in my eyes, a drone is an *unmanned* aerial vehicle. Putting a man in it means it's no longer a drone. However, English changes, so I can accept it, and as I've kept using it, I grew attached to the phrase. Now it sounds twice as futuristic as 'flying car.' 

'Drone taxi' works as well, though it's not as effective to me. But it's an example of giving new and innovative technologies *better* names, even though 'flying car' doesn't have any real stigma attached to it. If only other sci-tech developments were as lucky.",1,2,False,self,,,,,
