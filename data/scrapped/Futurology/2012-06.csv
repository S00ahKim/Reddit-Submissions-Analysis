The SFT Network has been born. I wanted to thank Kjoneslol for all his hard work on creating SFTN's CSS. As you can see, our sidebar links have been discarded, and the SFTN's banner has been raised high. I am really proud of everything this subreddit has become and wanted to also thank our contributors, readers, and moderators, for all the support.  

With the SFTN, we have linked together the Singularity, Futurology, and Transhuman subreddits under one banner, similar to the SFW Porn Network. It seems Reddit is evolving. 

We have come a long way and have become an amazing community in only a short period of time. The SFTN and this subreddit have a bright future, all puns intended. 

I have made a [post on /r/newreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/newreddits/comments/ueza1/the_sft_network_i_for_one_welcome_our_new_robot/) and have let the world know, in hopes of ultimately accelerating our Information Age and raising awareness of the technological Singularity.

Kjoneslol has already created an [IRC Channel for the Network](http://cbe005.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.snoonet.com&amp;nick=nickname%3F%3F%3F&amp;channel=%23singularitynetwork), generously offering to help set up the CSS for adding the SFTN drop down menu. If you want to join the SFTN, drop by, and we can easily help link your subreddit and set up the SFTN Banner.

""When you tell someone they're a million times more likely to get cancer from standing near paint fumes, the number is so large they find it laughable.  Tell someone they're 10 times more likely to get cancer from standing near paint fumes and they believe you.""

This seems to me the fundamental ""flaw"" in Futurology - it will be hard to gain true acceptance as an idea because it promises **too** much.  

This thought sprang from thinking how many posts here I should try to post in the general reddit subs, and how none of them would be believed/upvoted.  

If we told people about just the first 10 years of Russia2045 (or whatever), they might understand/accept enough to begin seriously considering it, even if sporadically.  When we tell people the *entire* Russia2045 concept, it becomes an idea they find laughable.

We can maintain our single identity. Avoid the contracts that give thought, our most precious commodity, to algorithms of corporate code. 

Declare a contract of our own. We are human. Our dreams, reason, and experience are stored within our minds. As of now, we cannot hardwire to others, yet we strive to be a connected people. Until then, this device is my tool. I grant to it the ability to be my conduit. A temporary bridge until we can transmit our love, compassion, and emotional sight.

If we can fear identity then we can also desire it. 

Rather than demand anonymity, seek acknowledgement. Freely create. Cast aside fears of human emotion and empower yourself with its reality, forwardness, and honesty of emotional response. This shared awareness will expose our common human links and replace ideology with reason.

Experience life, our memory of physical space and emotional reaction come through biological senses, the conduits of our ancestors. The human feedback recorded by this generation will be valuable to the history of mankind.

For now, ideas are the sum of our collaborated parts. Each part, tagged with its creative source, can provide a desire to spark to the fire within our minds. take the individual bits back to the creator, teacher, influence, or muse. Build the code to track the percentage of its influence. If the technology exists to identify individuals for market, then it can also credit them with dividends in an economy of thought.

Bits of code behind each pixel of every image, each letter of every word can have a history, a source, a memory of it's creation and areas of influence.

See theres so many problems with being a carnivore. We have to spare valuable land for the animals in question, feed them! kill them then finally ship out that food to customers. The customers then pay for their meal to be prepared finally to spend 10 plus minutes eating it.(Depending on the meal and restaurant)

I notice a lot of new ""energy"" crazes now a days from coffee to Redbull to 5 hour energy shots. Not only are there so many different brands and products but I always see their commercials on tv. And thats where I think our future of energy consumption will take us. Taking pills or concentrated drinks for our energy like in a video game.

I also believe that we will be one day never sleeping at all! the main theory behind why we sleep is to protect ourselves during the most vulnerable time - at night. The theory holds because the animals that can hide easily sleep for larger duration's of the day (like cats that sleep up to 20 hours a day) and larger animals that cant hide sleep for much less (like elephants that only sleep for 2 hours a day). But now theres much less danger and much more light. So these quick energy boosts could really come in handy in the near sleeplessness world

I dont have any problems with any of this, I think being a carnivore is ineffective, I'm just sharing my thoughts on our possible future. I hope this does actually happen and I am really excited to see the ways we evolve and change to accommodate for this new form of energy consumption. 

Sorry for the long post and feedback would be appreciated ",12,7,False,self,,,,,

Futurology could use something like a Marketing/PR Department.  

Off the top of my head - convincing Intel/IBM to set up manufacturing facilities on the moon.  

CPU's require silica, found in abundance in lunar regolith.

The manufacturing facilities require some of the cleanest/purest air on Earth.  On the moon that's not a worry; put workers in a spacesuit and they can work in a sealed (and automatically sterilized) vacuum. 

They also require intense heating, 1500-2000 degrees Celsius.  A solar reflector removes the majority of energy costs needed for that.   

And they already spend billions to set up these facilities here.  

Living in Oregon, I see plenty of towns that were created for a specific industry (logging).  Some industries may be able to be convinced to do the same with the Moon.",8,12,False,self,,,,,

I had the same thought at first, but then the more I looked at it, the more I realized that this picture is absolutely perfect for this subreddit. It expresses some really powerful ideas in an absolutely amazing way. Ideas that are at the very core of why I believe in futurology.

Complexity arising out of simpler systems

This piece is a celebration of the complexities that can arise when simple systems are combined together. The human blood, bone and nervours systems have combined together to create a being that is capable of seizing this moment of joy, of love. By reducing the human body to its basic systems, we can see that somewhere, from the interaction of blood, brain and tissue arises a being who can feel and love. 

Now, many of here at r/futurology take the idea of artificial intelligence very seriously. So we cringe when we hear people saying that there can be no such thing as artificial intelligence. These people think that no mere beings made of silicon, wires and electrical connection can compete with true intelligence, our intelligence. By reducing the human body to its basic system, this piece reminds us that intelligence and love has value on its own merits, not because of any sort of mythical specialty of the human body.

Its not just artificial intelligence, however. Steven Wolfram started what he calls a new kind of science by analyzing the ways in which uncomplex systems can have complex results.
	
http://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_everything.html

Understanding of these systems raising more beauty not less

However, just realizing that the body is made of systems is not enough to make this painting related to futurology. It shows that these systems are beautiful. Historically, understanding of systems has been looked down upon by artist. John Keats famously believed that Isaac Newton had destroyed the beauty of the rainbow by discovering its origins. He believed that to know the origins and causes of a thing was to remove it of its beauty. This painting, on the other hand, asserts the exact opposite. It shows systems which are more, not less beautiful because they are understood.

Celebration of the human form as it is, not based upon any mythical ideal

Now we see something complex and beautiful coming out of something simple. These two messages combine to form a celebration of humanity. These simple systems of bone and flesh and blood combine to allow this scene of love. The beauty exists because of the fallibility of humanity. If the beauty can exist within this fragile network of interconnected tubes and vessels, how much more could exist if we fully understand these systems and gain full control of them.

Thats why I think that that was a good post. Anything that supports our underlying ideals belongs here. But now I have a personal, non-mod appeal. Please no memes. Please only things that actually add to the conversation.

William Shatner (age 81) - Canadian actor. Has reportedly been following Kurzweil's regimen. In ""Transcendent Man"" Shatner says he wants to live as long as he can.

Suzanne Somers (age 65) - TV personality. Has been committed to staying young forever and does indeed look great. She is friends with Ray Kurzweil.  

Ray Kurzweil (age 64) - Widely acclaimed inventor and influential futurologist with a compelling record of accurate predictions. Takes around 150 pills a day to slow ageing and, his own words, reprogram his biology. 

Natasha Vita-More (age 61-62) dedicated transhumanist, designer of ""Primo Posthuman"". She is also the wife of Max More, the CEO and president of Alcor Life Extension Foundation.

Consider that aliens would have been travelling for thousands of years, across thousands of light-years to get to our solar system. The ship that arrives here first would likely be one built not too long after long-distance space travel was somehow made possible.

We, as a species, have not yet figured out how to make it possible, if it even is, so if the aliens arrive before we have, they will be the more advanced species. 

However, there is only a finite amount of time during which we don't know this secret, and the time for which we do could be infinite. When our species becomes extra-planetary, no nuclear war or natural catastrophe could wipe out our entire population.

So  in mankind's entire history, including the future, there is more time during which we will be more advanced than any aliens that arrive, than there is time when we will be less advanced. So chances are, when they turn up here, if ever, we'll be able to teach them more than they could teach us.",23,5,False,self,,,,,

It would take people out of their cars and buses, reducing city congestion. Also, you don't have to dig expensive tunnels with all the danger and difficulty that entails. Cable cars can also run on clean energy, offer great views, and be placed along or above existing streets/rivers etc.

At the moment we do not know if there will be a Big Crunch, and a new Big Bang, and within a few thousand million years ago, I sat at the back the same computer, typing these same words. Words on the other hand, I would have written. (The late Philip J. Fry, Futurama, Season 6, episode 95)

Most likely , probably nothing will survive a hypothetical Big Crunch, but while we wait to see if there is any way to travel to another universe to observe from a window as ours disappears, we would begin to break the cycle of life. The cycle makes from the moment of birth, our hours on earth are numbered. Hopefully soon you get to master how Telomerase, which will allow our biological bodies can live twice, or more,without hard problems.

Human beings have always felt a rational fear toward death. The unknown, the transition to an afterlife or disappearance, the eternal absence, and takes thousands of years wondering what will happen, and taking refuge in shells as small umbrella for the storm of fear.

Consider for a moment in our lives, our own ego self. Thats what makes me who I am, what makes each unique human being (from Dolly and we can not say, one-off), where is the perception of my existence? Is simply the physical limitations of my own body or a brain area is again one of the many areas of our personal computer used for each of the various purposes?

What if we could connect directly to a machine at the time when my body fails and the next to perish, and store with me my memories, thoughts, emotions, and how to see things up our particular personality? The simply recognize as our new body?

Would be met, at last, and in a verifiable, the phrase going to heaven? Understanding the Sky as the cloud computing course. Perhaps we could wander through the internet as smart programs, a sort of IN , Natural Intelligence, information technology, a software with feelings, a person without a body.
Once we have the cloud, the hardware would be a perfect complement able to interact individually released with the media again.

Imagine life as a computer program can be difficult. Internet will change much over the next years, just imagine, we could play video games (the machine would be player at once), we could see the news, television .. 
A hard drive would be our body and our prison, our home, our snail shell. But we lack the snail can move it.
Perhaps one of the most complex tasks that developers face is to teach the robot robotic thinking. The robots are already stronger than us, more resistant, can perform many tasks as quickly and not get tired. Like multicellular creatures have evolved (this time in a Lamarckian way, remote-controlled by us), there are automotive body paint, to install parts, welding chips, to explore the ocean floor and wrecks to explore deep space and planets, as flying machines of war, and as toys and company.

There is a very interesting documentary about how the engineers at Hondateach to learn Asimo (maybe the most famous robot in our days), to recognize objects, and think itself. They teach an apple, or a brush, and the eyes of Asimo, cameras, internalized in memory that is each object, and the next time he see it, recognize it automatically. The process is slow and tedious, but the little Asimo learns little by little. In the same documentary, there is the difficult process of getting a robot to walk bipedally, which in humans takes us a few months, engineers took years of development, the process of walking and running is very complex for machines, but this is solved today, they can even run.

Maybe one day you can take all the knowledge acquired to provide physical support to people with no body. If your program was installed, Natural Intelligence in a complex robot, we could return to the world freewill, we would have other needs, maybe we would live in closets, as Bender, and our food would be electricity. We would also have other advantages, not grow old, we could improve ourselves gradually installing new parts, there would be no sickness, no need to sleep, we could dive for years, or explore space.

To make this possible, in addition to machine translation, of the cloud, and the development of robotics, it would be necessary to have a perpetual energy source (ITER hopefully work well), and a significant improvement in batteries, the development of electric cars is boosting this knowledge fields.

In return, a future where there will be virtually no limit possibilities, literally, swing the universe by its tail. What is an space travel a hundred years for a person without a body, which can live in the cloud, and that can bill one body to Gliese 876 and stay while living in two different places simultaneously. Walk on the Moon or Mars would be like down to the site from home.

Immortality, omnipresence. The man becomes a God.

Greetings!
