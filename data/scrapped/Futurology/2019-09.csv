On a long straight path he stepped on the speeder, and while the car was going faster and faster, he calmly told me to hold my focus on a point as far ahead as possible.

As the needle moved past 170 km/h my mother and my sisters became more and more anxious. At some point they were really scared and shouted to him to slow down. He ignored them, and I did my best to do the same.

Mixed emotions running through my body, while my white knuckles were clenching on the steering wheel.

My father had his own demons to fight like I had mine.

Three years after this experience I was riding my bicycle with my then 4-year old sister in front of me, both of us holding the handlebars: Me steering, her for support.

*Would you like to steer the bicycle while I close my eyes?*, I asked her.

*Sure*!, she said.

I closed my eyes and let go of the handlebars.

A few seconds later we crashed.

Her foot was entangled in the front wheel, and from the way she cried I could tell it was painful. Carrying her home I felt ashamed. How could I be so thoughtless?

Here as an adult reflecting on these two childhood memories, did they have any similarity? And what is the underlying mechanisms? What is this longing to let go of control?

Something in us is seeking liberation. Or alleviation to use a word my father used to describe why he was drinking alcohol.

I certainly have had the feeling of being trapped for the most part of my life. And maybe you did also. But we should not feel trapped.

*Why*?

Because *it takes something trapped to make a trap* as Alan Watts say.

So lets understand why we are not trapped, and in doing so, gather our wits. We need them.

Getting to the root of this matter and weeding out what needs to go, holds the promise of liberation. Satyrfying our mighty expectation of relief.

The journey towards these roots are no less challenging than the journey Odysseus made to liberate  and re-unite with  his family, but it is well worth the effort.

The first obstacles on this journey is the observation that the very faculty, we use to understand what is going on, is itself deeply entangled in the matter:

Our mind using language and concepts.

This tiger, when not proberly disciplined, have the power to drive humanity full speed towards a cliff. And currently it is.

Our children are in the car. Some are shouting and crying.

Like in the taiga, the adults in the car (you?) who realize what is happening falls into two categories:

One gets scared and then starts thinking.

The other one starts thinking and then get scared later.

To think about this matter takes a certain amount of courage, because in what we call reality something has happened that is equivalent to being attacked by a tiger.

We learn of tigers that *the impact of an attacking tiger can be compared to that of a piano falling on you from a second-story window. But unlike the piano, the tiger is designed to do this, and the impact is only the beginning*.

Let that sink in.

To turn the odds in our favour we need the strength of the tiger to gain control of the car. And because of this we have decided to face it.

Remember?

Keep breathing.

After all this is just a story about cars and tigers, right?

Stories have always been here and are sometimes dug up from beneath the desert, like it happened in the last century. We call them the dead sea scrolls :

*In the Beginning You Knew,*  
*Then You Pretended to Forget,*  
*Then You Pretended to Forget that You Forgot,*  
*Then You Forgot You Pretended.*

Remember?

The sea is not dead yet, so lets keep going.

At some point in our life something entangles us: The consensus-based meaning.

And we enter into a state of forgetfulness. A shadow seizes us and we start to think that this shadow is us. It is not.

It is *the Proud Angel driven forth from Heaven* as the druids taught us.

When meaning that can be passed on from generation to generation occurred the teeth of the tiger tightened on its prey.

*When you teach a child the word bird, the child will never see a bird again.*

Increasingly the child will see a concept, based on thought and memory.

We begin to live in thoughts, not in reality. The change from the liveliness of a toddler to the deadened facial expression of a youngster is evidence of just how potent the grip of the tiger is.

The plant- and animal kingdom uses different means of communication. Electrical signals. Gestures. The whales are singing.

We were once dancing around the fire. Then using vocal sounds with intentionality. And then words with specific meanings came as the cherry on the cake.

The push in creation towards meaning is evidence of its fallen nature. IT is fallen until we manoeuvre US from between the teeth of the tiger onto its back, where the AIr is much more refreshing.

Lets do that.",0,0

Hopefully, this post is ok for this sub. I know that subs can be strict sometimes about what they allow. 

So, here's my thesis: Because of nuclear weapons, the human race is probably fucked. I'll explain why. 

**Reason 1: Eventually, the nukes will be used.**

We're extremely lucky that nuclear weapons haven't been used since WWII. But, our luck isn't going to last forever. I don't know how long it will take for a nuclear WWIII to happen. Maybe 50 years, maybe 100, maybe 1000. Its impossible to say. 

But, as time progresses, the probability that they won't be used approaches zero. Someone will eventually pull the trigger. When that happens, the most likely scenario is that we all die. The best possible scenario is that we get to experience a radioactive dystopia full of suffering and mass death. 

**Reason 2: Governments grow increasingly corrupt over time, and they eventually collapse.**

Here's the story of human history. An area experiences prosperity for some reason or another. An armed force takes control of the area and forms a state. Sometimes they rule justly, sometimes they don't. Sometimes, people get lucky, and the economy flourishes. If this happens, the state grows richer. 

As time goes on, some states are conquered by other states, some states collapse due to unforeseen economic disasters, and some states are torn apart by civil war. If none of these things happen, the state will grow increasingly corrupt until it collapses due to mismanagement. 

However, we can't afford to experience the collapse of a nuclear state. Collapsing states get desperate and reckless. They might find some reason to make use of their nuclear arsenal. 

And yet, we also can't afford to not have the state collapse. If a government isn't destroyed for reasons out of its control, it eventually grows corrupt and unbearable to live under. The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots &amp; tyrants. At least, that's how its always been. 

So, we find ourselves in an unprecedented situation. As time goes on, we will try desperately to preserve our increasingly corrupt and tyrannical governments. However, despite our best efforts, they'll eventually collapse, and there will be a high probability that they'll get desperate enough to use their nukes. 

**Humanity's Slim Chance of Survival**

So, its going to be extremely difficult for humanity to survive in the long term. We're most likely all going to die. 

In order to survive, we have to do something extremely difficult. Our nuclear states will eventually need to collapse peacefully, and we'll need to quickly transition to a new government, with an absolute minimum of violence and instability. This is extremely hard to pull off. 

However, even if we accomplish this great feat, we're still in trouble for Reason 1. As the millennia go by, we will need to do this repeatedly. We'll need to continually defuse situations which could lead to nuclear Armageddon. Even if we succeed in doing this 100 times, we will eventually fail. Someone will eventually launch the nukes. 

So, as far as I can see, we have two slim chances of survival. One, we escape the Earth and settle on other planets before nukes get used. No easy task. If we can do this, a nuclear war on one planet won't doom the species as a whole. 

The only other option is that we revert to a primitive state and forget how to use the nukes. This...is not impossible. 

Humanity has existed for around 200,000 years. For the vast majority of that history we lived as simple hunter gatherers. We don't know for sure that our technological advancement will last forever. The last 500 years might just be a blip in the history of our species. We may eventually return to our primitive ways. 

If that happens, we might be able to avoid nuclear Armageddon. Though, we will eventually die when the sun explodes. So, in order to survive that, we'll need to pursue the first option and eventually escape the solar system. 

**So there you have it**

So yeah, that's what I think. Our species is probably going to die in a nuclear fireball. It's not impossible that we'll survive. But, it will be extremely difficult. As people smarter than me have theorized, its entirely possible we haven't found any aliens because they all kill themselves once they get too advanced.

So I have been thinking that in some places like the US and other regions in the world students face huge economic burdens to achieving an education. But what is really required here? Some people have to move away from home, find housing, pay for their own meals, textbooks, school course materials, computer programs, transportation, school facility fees etc. Schools that are also for profit can charge students upwards of 50k for an undergraduate degree, which is straight up ridiculous. Not to mention how hard it is to find a job to even begin paying back these loans with certain degrees. 

So what I am saying this: With the advent of VR and AR technology and 5G networks there really wont be any need to leave your house to get a first class education. The first group to seriously put together an actual Virtual school with begin to turn the tables. 

Learning about Mars for Astronomy class? Why not go there with the students and the teacher and walk around while discussing the planet.

Learning about Ancient Rome? Walk the streets of streets of the city and visit historical places and figures who reenact the historical scenario.

Working on a group project for a Psychology class? Meet in a virtual cafe to talk and present ideas in a shared group space where you can create word documents, PowerPoint presentations and video clips. 

So in the near future why will we need to actually go to a university with all the costs associated with it? Why wouldn't you buy a VR headset for under $1000 and a decent internet connection?

How could brick and mortar school compete with this business model? Sure some educations like medicine will still need in class work for obvious reasons but a good portion of most academic fields could and should be fully digitized.

**Why preventing deforestation is more important**:

From the [latest Global Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf) it seems to be clear that it would be more effective to stop deforestation than to allow it to happen and then reforest. For example, [as the European Commission writes](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-08-632_en.htm):

&gt;In terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to cut down trees and reforest subsequently, as deforestation leads to some irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.

[On Wikipedia it says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation#Criticisms):

&gt;There is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.

and according to [this recent study and its report](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02450-6) the probability that legacy carbon (organic carbon that has escaped earlier fires and has accumulated at the surface of boreal-forest soils) will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forest.

Furthermore it can be harder to rebuild a forest than to prevent its destruction. This is also because a healthy forest requires biodiversity and other things. For example some trees used in some reforesting efforts can prevent the growth of other plants and can prevent growth of diverse vegetation. This in turn can for example also lead to more destructive wildfires in (re)forested areas.

But the main issue with reforestation as a solution is that:

&gt;Perhaps the biggest difficulty with reforestation as a strategy is simply that it takes so much time to reap the benefits for global warming. If you plant a seedling today, it will take several decades to get the same carbon sequestration benefits we get from mature trees in tropical forests. So, in the short and medium term, reforestation cannot offer nearly as much benefit as limiting deforestation in the first place.

[as Dr. Doug Boucher, Union of Concerned Scientists' Director of Climate Research and Analysis has put it](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/would-reforestation-help-counter-deforestation).

What do you think of aggregating and discussing these projects here? Should we include technologies and ideas? Or should it be projects only? I guess there are many technologies that could be used for this in one way or another. But maybe there should be a separate thread for these? By the way the third column could include all kinds of additional information: for example data on who is funding the projects.

I'm not sure if there ever was an aggregation-thread like this in here before so let's see how this goes: I'm certainly interested in what projects there are out there. I'm not affiliated with any of the projects and I don't think there will be a better time to discuss this than now as the world media's spotlight on the Amazon fires (note: Africa is burning too!) hasn't entirely faded yet.

**Why preventing deforestation is more important:**

From the latest [Global Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf) it seems to be clear that it would be more effective to stop deforestation than to allow it to happen and then reforest.

For example, [as the European Commission writes](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-08-632_en.htm):

&gt;In terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to cut down trees and reforest subsequently, as deforestation leads to some irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.

[On Wikipedia it says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation#Criticisms):

&gt;There is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.

and according to [this recent study and its report](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1474-y) the probability that legacy carbon (organic carbon that has escaped earlier fires and has accumulated at the surface of boreal-forest soils) will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forest.

Furthermore it can be harder to rebuild a forest than to prevent its destruction. This is also because a healthy forest requires biodiversity and other things. For example some trees used in some reforesting efforts can prevent the growth of other plants and can prevent growth of diverse vegetation. This in turn can for example also lead to more destructive wildfires in (re)forested areas. [Jonah Busch states](https://earthinnovation.org/2019/05/reforestation-can-help-reverse-the-climate-and-extinction-crises/) that:

&gt;Avoided deforestation offers ten times as much abatement as reforestation at $20 per ton

while:

&gt;reforestation is more cost-effective than avoiding deforestation in some places

The main issue with reforestation as a solution is that:

&gt;Perhaps the biggest difficulty with reforestation as a strategy is simply that it takes so much time to reap the benefits for global warming. If you plant a seedling today, it will take several decades to get the same carbon sequestration benefits we get from mature trees in tropical forests. So, in the short and medium term, reforestation cannot offer nearly as much benefit as limiting deforestation in the first place.

[as Doug Boucher, UCS Director of Climate Research and Analysis has put it](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/would-reforestation-help-counter-deforestation).

What do you think of aggregating and discussing these projects here? Should we include technologies and ideas in this aggregation? Or should it be projects only? I guess there are many technologies that could be used for this in way to another. But maybe that would be better as a separate thread. By the way the third column could contain all sorts of information such as information on the projects' funding.

I'm not sure if there ever was an aggregation-thread like this in here before so let's see how this goes: I'm certainly interested in what projects there are out there. I'm not affiliated with any of the projects and I don't think there will be a better time to discuss this than now as the world media's spotlight on the Amazon fires hasn't entirely faded yet.

Sentience as we currently understand it, is a product of the brain interacting with the physical world through the intermediary of our nervous system. These are all carbon based, biological components. There are no examples of sentience in non-living things, let alone non-brained things. Why would one speculate that complexity creates sentience? The idea goes: once computers become complex enough, they'll become sentient. How does this make any sense? How does one measure complexity? Why shouldn't the universe itself then be sentient? Sentience requires one to have a subjective experience, which is only demonstrated to be possible if one can feel basic emotions such as the dichotomy of pleasure and suffering, without which, there is nothing to experience. I personally posit that the subjective experience is an illusion which manifests itself through the evolutionary advantage of having the dichotomy of pleasure and suffering, however, this is not yet fact, therefore it may be disregarded for this post. There are infinite questions without any answers in regard to AI being sentient, so it seems to me the logical and skeptical thing to do is to disbelieve until evidence arises in support of the hypothesis that AI can develop sentience.",85,0

(kinda)

Earth has changed significantly since last we saw her. Her people have wised up, through trials and tribulations, gotten their act together and are thriving. Low-Earth-Orbit used to be polluted with satellites, most non-functional and derelict. Now, however, humans cleaned LEO of all the non-functioning satellites and recycled the materials for more advanced technologies. They built new systems, a 3 tiered sphere, called the techno=sphere, surrounding the Earth with 3 objectives. 

Tier 1 is the lowest level, closest to the surface, manages and mitigates extremely severe weather anomalies. After it was put in place there was never again a hurricane that wreaked havoc on the coasts. 

Tier 2 manages all communication on and off world, its installation provided access to the internet planet wide and allowed even the most remote places to become inhabited. In conjunction with the relay stations placed at Earth's Lagrange points 3, 4, and 5, every human structure in the solar system maintains constant communications with Earth.

Tier 1, the most recent addition to the techno-sphere, provides planetary defense for Earth from incoming asteroids, and crashing spacecraft. 

The relay stations at Earths Lagrange points 3, 4, and 5 serve not just as relay stations, but also research labs, training grounds, emergency aid to nearby spacecraft, and the first line of defense against incoming asteroids. 

Luna, Earths moon, has become a thriving colony. Chalk full of scientists, engineers, miners, families, and the odd bio-dome. Luna was the first celestial body to be colonized by humans, and they're not stopping there. 

Mars, the Red Planet, isn't so red anymore. Terraforming efforts began here long ago and humans have made some real progress. A massive electromagnetic dynamo was placed at Mars' Lagrange point 1, creating a magnetic field thats pushed towards the planet by the solar wind, encapsulating it and preventing the solar wind from destroying the atmosphere thats in its infancy. Humans sapped millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere of Venus and dispensed it into the atmosphere of Mars, warming the planet and providing the settlers with the resources they needed to begin colonizing. Now, the planet is a much duller red than it was in years past. The introduction of genetically engineered microbes allowed for algae to grow and produce oxygen from the toxic environment. Water locked deep within the crust began flowing across the surface again, the iron in the soil became available for use and with some effort yielded the first martians steels. Bio-domes and encampments on the surface serve as temporary living space for the colonizers until the atmosphere is within tolerable levels. Some domes serve to preserve Mars' original state so that future generations will know what it was like, and so that they can study what once was. 

Venus is an interesting side project of theirs, sapping the CO2 from the atmosphere to utilize the oxygen and the carbon to produce breathable air and carbon based materials for their expansion. Meanwhile studying the planets surface that they can now observe and determine their future there. 

Mercury was swallowed by their expansion, used as building material. It wasn't missed, but the textbooks now had an addendum; ""Mercury, once the closest planet to the sun in our solar system, no longer holds that honor but instead, holds the designation of Solar Prime."" 

On that note, a dyson swarm now surrounds their star. Called ""Solar Prime"", it was built using materials mostly from Mercury, hence the addendum. With Solar Prime in place, no settlement in the solar system has ever been without power. 

Expanding farther into their solar system has had some stumbling blocks however. Jupiter is their main problem, not the moons, the rings, the radiation, or even the distance. Its the isolation from the trip, and the unbelievable majesty of the planet itself. Its a form of psychosis they're calling ""The jovian longing"". Some settlers deprive themselves of human contact during the trip so much that once they see the awesome beauty of the planet they want to be closer. They long to be on the surface of the planet, to see the clouds from the other side. Which, of course, is impossible hence their identifying it as a psychosis. In more than a few cases the people suffering from it have been the pilots that are under immense stress and when they arrive they nose dive straight into the stormy clouds, taking everyone on board with them. I have faith they'll find a solution to it though, nothing has stopped them yet.",0,0

I recently finished a project based on work done at the MIT Media Lab to construct a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that allows you to telepathically query Google search. I just finished writing an end to end tutorial for anyone seeking to replicate this, along with general information about Neuralink and other BCI companies. I also included a list of some resources (textbooks, websites, organizations, Github repos) that I found helpful.

[https://medium.com/@jaguarsingh/merging-with-ai-how-to-make-a-brain-computer-interface-to-communicate-with-google-using-keras-and-f9414c540a92](https://medium.com/@jaguarsingh/merging-with-ai-how-to-make-a-brain-computer-interface-to-communicate-with-google-using-keras-and-f9414c540a92)

Id really appreciate any support in the form of Medium claps or comments, as well as any feedback on what to improve for future tutorials (currently working on one on how to make a BCI VR game with OpenBCI and Unity).",0,6

I was wondering if you made a Stirling engine say the height of a skyscraper with the width of a Stadium could you use that to passively fight climate change, and create electric power at the same time? Sorry for the crazy idea. I just like to play around with this sort of stuff. In theory you would build the exterior of the Stirling engine with a graphene composite for strength. 

We could use methane from other industrial processes. Using direct air capture using graphene molecular sieves. So in every step we could be actively fighting this climate crisis. 

Do any of you have ideas for realistic ways to deal with the climate crisis in time? I'm really open for anything especially if the projects can pay for themselves with either an environmentally friendly product, or by creation of renewable energy. I'm tired of waiting for others to fix this. I want to work with anyone trying to deal with this. Regardless thank you for taking the time to read this. I believe we can do this!!!",11,4

(Unions don't help you and are bad for the workforce.)  And finally three, beat and batter the work force down, degrade and make the job market unstable. Creating obstructionary debt though schooling,homes and credit. In doing these three things you create a entry place market that will challenge China and other third world manufacturers for shares of global manufacturing markets.  How do you increase profits?  low wage workforce, no benefits, and utilization of local resources to keep transportation costs down to a minimum.  With the government on board, slowly eroding the infrastructure of all instatusions.  Lowering corporate taxes to lowest it has been in 50 years.  Putting a disproportionate amount of benefits into the hands that pull the strings.   It's the long game that matters.  Most of the masses think in short term blocks.  Day to day reality is more important then any long term ideology.  Think about it. When ever has something you wanted or worked on turned out to be exactly what you imagined it would be.  Think of any 5 year plan.  It is hardly ever meet. You set goals but have to be flexible about what you want.  You will get distracted or set new goals or buy into the idea that debt is good.  All media is on the scam of distraction.  We are bombarded with to much information as well as to much misinformation.  We are told what to buy, how to think, what we need and don't need.  We are over medicated, overwhelmed, underutilized and manipulated beyond any real possibility of organized thought.  We are dealing with slow motion characters willing to gain profit at all costs.

But, I think that privately owned vehicles(POVs) are going to go away, and with them a lot of things will change.  Now, I am not saying that cars are going away or that no one will own cars, but I do believe that car ownership is going to go way down.  Why?  well, for three reasons  Self driving cars, electric cars and ride shares.

Self driving cars can sit in a garage or other centralized structure charging on their own while waiting to be called by users.  People would sign up for the ride share and call a car when they need it, the car would leave its charging port and drive the user to where they need to go before moving on to the next user or back to a charging port.  At no point would the user need to own their own car, in fact, it would be cheaper just to pay per ride or even monthly subscription for the ride share service.

Now, this would have some interesting effects.  First off driving jobs are going to go away, trucking jobs are already being threatened by self driving cars but, taxi, uber, ups, ect. are also going to go away.  Uber and Lyfts biggest expense are their drivers, those companies would be profitable if they didn't have to pay people.  And since all cars are self driving, Traffic lights, stop signs and posted speed limits(at least the signs) can also go away. Those things exist to help curb destructive human behavior and self driving vehicles wont need them.

Thoughts?  I doubt I am breaking any ground here, its just something that I've been thinking about recently.",8,0

I genuinely don't see much getting done with any of those other candidates because they aren't tackling something at the core of human nature : The fact that we require incentives to drive us and progress. 

The question becomes, what kind of incentives are these, and how can we prevent Corporations or even a Government from exploiting this. 

This very problem has been at the core of why many of us, do not see a [viable path forward in our modern society.](https://time.com/5606411/millennials-deaths-of-despair/)

Our institutions no longer serve us! [They are outdated,](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/03/america-gerontocracy-problem-politics-old-politicians-trump-biden-sanders-227986) and instead of the pursuit of innovative ways to tackle this problem, what we find ourselves with is a bunch politicians with no frame of reference as to the nature of our modern society. Instead, they seek either 19th/20th century solutions to problems we have not yet encountered.

The solution lies in Andrew's [Human Centered Capitalism](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/). Good policy aligns social incentives with that of corporate and governmental goals. If you don't have policies that keep the human components of bureaucracies in check, irrespective of your insights,goals or desire for revolution you ultimately flop.

Andrew's platform is one that simply transcends the mere political process and seeks to solve this fundamental problem. It seeks to hold the human component of organisations irrespective of their makeup, cognizant of their biases and drive them to pro-social goals. This is Yuuuge! 

If anyone of those other candidates win, you will either have a persistent status quo, or an incompetent ultimately concentrated govermment that believes it knows better for the individual than what they may be facing in their lives. 

We see this with Bernie's FJG; we see this with Trump's tax cuts (which do nothing more than benefit the wealthy); We see this with Warren's [lack of acceptance of the problems that automation presents](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/a-plan-for-economic-patriotism-13b879f4cfc7) and will present, and ultimately the [lack of Technological knowledge]( https://tech.co/news/politicians-out-of-touch-laws-regulate-tech-2018-10)that is so obvious within the American Government. 


The last one bothers me most. The reason for this happens to be that, Technology has been at the core of human progress. It has also however, been at the [core of Inequality as well](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531726/technology-and-inequality/). The true elites of our societies are those who harness Technology and are aware of the influence of Technology in our society today. Our biggest companies today are all Tech Companies for this very reason. And you have a government that is simply clueless as to what awaits us!

Never have we been able to alter the human DNA to our benefit! This is bound to revolutionise healthcare, but in other contexts will present questions about the nature of humanity, and ethical dilemmas which we already see today! 

Just recently a Chinese Scientist by the name of He Jiankui, edited the [Genes of twins](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00673-1) in the hope of becoming world famous and profiting of his fame. Gene editing may present such problems because the vast population knows nothing about this! It may further worsen inequality by giving individuals certain traits that will further give them cognitive as well physical advantages.

Pattern finding had been at the core of human innovation. And yet we have built tools that seek to not only do tasks more efficiently than we do, but learns to do them better, with each iteration of the performance of the task. And surprisingly, even those at the forefront of those technologies, [are not aware of their full capabilities](https://qz.com/1146753/ai-is-now-so-complex-its-creators-cant-trust-why-it-makes-decisions/) and seek guidelines as well.

All these aren't distant from here. They aren't some far off reality. We are living these today!

 We have already seen Andrew's ability to get politicians to see the impacts and seriousness of Automation. But this isn't enough. We need a politician who realizes the importance of Technology today and Tomorrow.

The one persistent problem I've realized about politics today is that it is *reactive* and not proactive. Politicians want the problem to be apparent to every single individual before they choose to tackle it. And by the time that happens, you realise that the problem has metamorphosed and the government supposed to tackle these problems, lags decades behind in the implementation of solutions. 

We need individuals who see these trends in data and who act to provide solutions before the people face these problems. 

So far, the only candidate who presents solutions to both the meta components of the problems America faces, and the more immediately obvious problems that the people faces, is Andrew Yang.

So visionary is Yang that when he stood on the podium at the last debate, and stated the very fact that America is 10 years too late on Climate Change he was met with dead silence and rebuke. Fast forward a few weeks and months later we realize that he was more than right if not even understated in his claim. We are 50 years behind.

When he brought out his Climate Change proposal, many shunned him for the claim that we both need to get to Higher Ground and the fact that we need to focus on adaptation as well. Green Peace gave him a D- for his plan. Today, the [UN seeks to hold a summit with people at the forefront of the battle including Bill Gates on the very nature of adaptation regarding the problems we face with Climate Change today.](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/global-leaders-call-urgent-action-climate-adaptation-commission)

Yang realizes before the others the necessity of certain solutions! This vision, this insight that isn't bound by ideology but by a genuine desire to solve the problems that face not only America but the world as a whole, is what we would expect from our politicians, but is so obviously absent it hurts. His willingness to speak the truth to the best extent he can, is a mark originality that is lost in society and politics at large.

Andrew Yang isn't flawless. But he is human and an intelligent one at that. I for example am a massive proponent of a UBI. But I would be lying if I said I had few concerns about his implementation. But he offers policies like making [Data A Property Right](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/data-property-right/), [Crypto and Digital Asset Regulation for Consumer Protection](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/digital-asset-regulation/),[the use of Thorium Reactors](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/digital-asset-regulation/), and many more that shows me that he's more than willing to make use and at least try to understand Technology.

We need to get Andrew Yang into the White House this coming season. If we can't, we have to make sure he persists. Because the truth is that we need him and his approach to problem solving, more than ever. We need his insights. We need a futurist! We need Andrew Yang!",25,28

It is an uninformed article, and I decided to break down where they failed. (Article [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/how-does-an-autonomous-car-work/)) It is an animated click thru ""demo"" of situations for a self driving car. (Didn't know what sub to post this in. Let me know where to move/post it to)

&amp;#x200B;

I broke down the situations they present.

**1. The auto didn't see the red light.**

Their footnote: ""We reviewed thousands of disengagement instances in 2018 reports, filed by 47 companies to the Department of Motor Vehicles in California. It's the only state that requires disclosure of this information. The reports are often vague and inconsistent. They are a poor measure for assessing safety in a largely unregulated industry.""

My thoughts: Out of thousands of reports, the WP found ""several"" instances. That is a vague statement, which leads me to believe that it is a relatively small number. Were the number statistically significant, they would have reported it to support their argument.

Counter argument: Human drivers drive thru red lights constantly. Just ask Culver City in CA how much money they make annually off red light cameras.

**2. The auto failed to see the broken down truck.**

Their foot note is largely of a similar nature that there were ""multiple reports"" and ""several instances"" of this happening. Again, were it statistically significant, an actual number should be given.

Counter argument: Again human drivers crash into stopped cars, whether they are broken down or attempting to turn. 

**3. The auto stopped because there was a kangaroo hopping down the road and it confused the cars computer.**

My thoughts: Honestly, I don't know what they were trying to prove with this one. If I saw a kangaroo hopping down the street I would probably stop my car too. Their research stated that Volvo was training their car to spot moose, and that the car was ""confused"" by a kangaroo. 

Counter Argument: Having a car stop when a moose (or Kangaroo) is in the road is a good thing. Additionally, moose and kangaroos do not share any native habitats. So again, what are they trying to prove with an impossible scenario?

**4. The auto struggled to differentiate between a pedestrian and a bicyclist and stopped too soon at a red light.**

They reference the tragic 2018 self-driving crash where an Uber vehicle hit and killed a pedestrian. This is tragic, and should not be made light of or overlooked. However, their own footnote states ""...the system wasn't designed to alert the driver, who was distracted at the time of impact."" The WP just countered their own argument. The human driver was distracted. 

My thoughts: I live in Los Angeles and the times I see cars stopped well before the stop-line at intersections makes it a fairly common occurrence. I know the plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data,"" but some inferences can be made. 

Counter argument: In 2017 there were 6,760 pedestrians and cyclist killed by cars in the USA, the majority of which do not occur at intersections. (Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). With all the millions of miles driven by autos, they have killed 1. That 1 is a tragedy, but it is still far, far fewer deaths per mile than human drivers. Autos don't need to be perfect, just better than humans.

**5. There is a dust storm approaching, so the auto pulled over and the human has to drive the rest of the way.**

Umm...I would have had to drive the entire way without and auto, so this is more an inconvenience than a problem.

Counter Argument: Human drivers need to pull over for blinding rain, snow storms, dust storms, heavy winds, etc. Weather delays are not a unique problem to autos.

**Final Thoughts:**

The Washington Post ""...reviewed more than a thousand pages of autonomous vehicle disengagement reports, filed to the California Department of Motor Vehicles from 2015 to 2018, as well as crash reports involving self-driving cars from the National Transportation Safety Board and guidelines on automated vehicles from the Transportation Department."" From those 3 years of data they found 1 death and a kangaroo. I fear I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but to me, that is not statistically significant.

This article reads, at best, like a poorly written fluff piece to receive clicks, and at worst, it is yellow journalism creating fear and misinformation out of nothing. People need to stop demanding perfection from self driving vehicles. There were 37,133 motor vehicle fatalities in the USA in 2017. If autos are 50% better at driving that human, it could save around 18,000 lives per year. Even if they are only 20% better, it could save 7,500 lives per year.

Not to mention the added benefit of lower insurance rates, fewer repairs to vehicles and property, etc. It would also save people millions in medical expenses. I say this because not all accidents are fatal and in 2017 there were 6,452,000 motor vehicle crashes. I for one would take a 50%, 20%, or even 10% reduction in that number.

It's time to stop fear mongering and playing endless games of ""what if?"" If history teaches us anything, it's that technology always wins. The horse carriage makers probably claimed that the first cars were a fad, too dangerous, too expensive, etc. But technology always wins.

It may have already won. There are thousands of Teslas already on the road with the auto-pilot feature. And it is an auto in all but name.",2,9

LA Department of Water &amp; Power just approved a 400 megawatt (aka a fuck ton of watt) solar plant in the SoCal desert. Its named Eland.

Eland will deliver up to 400 MW of clean energy to the grid while capable of storing up to 300 MW/1200 MWh, dispatchable for use when the sun is not shining, typically in the evening and night hours when the load is still high. Located just 70 miles north of Los Angeles close to California City on over 2,000 acres of barren, desert land, much of which was previously disturbed, Eland will be built in two phases starting operations in 2022 with full operational capabilities in 2023. The project will be the largest municipal photovoltaic operation in the world. Due to the partnerships unprecedented scale, 8minute is able to provide LADWP with the lowest solar energy prices on record in the U.S.: less than 2 cents per kWh.

Everything from your physical appearance, to your brain, your memories, everything that makes up who you are, stored in some sort of supercomputer.   
So let's just say you want to get from point a to point b.   You would step on some sort of platform and your entire body would be disintegrated but not before your entire information being downloaded and stored in a supercomputer.  Then you would be beamed over to point b and you would be built up again with the same body and the same memories that you had.   


Of course then the question might be, is this really teleportation?   Are the persons from point a and point b the same person?   If I step on to point A, will I be essentially killed while the other me is actually a clone?",7,0

The only argument that I can think of *for* keeping live animals in zoos is the authenticity of the experience. Other than that, aside from cattle-like animals which are relatively easy to please, there's only negatives: ethically it's pretty shitty, it's hard to keep them healthy, it costs a lot of money.

At the same time, the technology seems to be getting there. These modern Boston Dynamics dogs seem to be pretty good at moving around, and I have to imagine it would be even easier in an enclosed paddock since they can learn the terrain. They also wouldn't need to handle any novel situations, just sort of walk around. They'd charge at night, or even wirelessly by laying around a certain area for a while.

Then there's the possibility of recreating extinct species or even imaginary ones. I'd fly halfway around the world to go to an animatronic fantasy monster zoo, or an animatronic Jurassic Park, in a heartbeat.

And yet, I've never heard as much as a peep about anything like this, no start-ups or research or even hypothetical discussions. Is there a reason that I'm missing?",14,6

Disturbed by the increasing prevalence of fake news, a broad coalition of artificial intelligence, technology and media companies has come together to counteract the scourge.

The ability to create synthetic or manipulated content that is difficult to discern from real events frames the urgent need for developing new capabilities for detecting such content, observes Terah Lyons, executive director, The Partnership on AI.

The coalition  also supported by a number of nonprofit organizations -- will also develop software to authenticate trusted news media, Lyon says.

Ironically, fake news is often generated by the same technology  artificial intelligence  that the AI and media communities plan to use against it.

1460,2019-9-17,2019,9,17,4,d54wfc,Generating surplus energy using an electric vehicle's regenerative braking [OC],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/d54wfc/generating_surplus_energy_using_an_electric/,everyEV,1568660644,"Once you think of an electric vehicle as a potential energy generator, you start to think of different ways to hack regenerative braking to create energy.

Way # 1: add mass to an electric vehicle at the top of a hill and use the extra potential energy along with the vehicles regenerative braking to create surplus energy.

A formula to estimate the energy consumed by an electric vehicle driving up a hill (= potential energy + running energy):

`[ (A kg (mass of vehicle including cargo))*(9.8m/s^2 (gravitational constant))*(B meters (elevation gain))3,600,000 Joules/kWh (factor)) + (C kWh/km (vehicle efficiency))*(D km (distance)) = (E kWh (energy consumed by an electric vehicle driving up an incline) ]`

An equivalent formula to estimate the energy generated by an electric vehicles regenerative braking on the down-slope of a hill (= (potential energy  running energy)*(regenerative braking efficiency)):

`[ ((Z kg (mass of vehicle including cargo))*(9.8m/s^2 (gravitational constant))*(Y meters (elevation gain))3,600,000 Joules/kWh (factor)) - (X kWh/km (vehicle efficiency))*(W km (distance))*(0.9 (efficiency factor)) = (V kWh (energy generated by an electric vehicle driving down an incline) ]`

Note that these two formulas are independent of each other (in other words (A kg (mass of vehicle including cargo)) on the up-slope may or may not be equal to (Z kg (mass of vehicle including cargo)) on the down-slope, etc.. Also note that the slope of the incline will play a significant role in the result. 0.9 is an estimate of the regenerative charging efficiency on a down-slope.

Consider a Tesla Model 3 (+ driver) going up and down Rosedale Chimney, North York Moors, UK (with zero cargo on both the up-slope as well as the down-slope): Using the two formulas provided above yields an estimate of 1.08kWh consumed going up the hill and 0.582kWh generated going down.

[Rosedale Chimney] (https://veloviewer.com/segments/6690945?referrer=Embed_cyclinguphill.com)

Distance: 1.3km

Elevation change: 181m

Average Grade: 14.06%

Tesla Model 3: ~ (0.163kWh/km) (6.12km/kWh) (0.260kWh/mile) (3.8 miles/kWh)

weight of Tesla Model 3 + driver: ~ 1752kg

speed up-slope: 70km/h

speed down-slope: 70km/h (limited by regenerative braking)

*CALCULATIONS*

Energy consumed going up: [1.08kWh]

(1752kg)(9.8m/s2 )(1432m)(3,600,000J/kWh)= 0.863kWh (potential energy)

(1.3km)*(0.163kWh/km) = 0.212kWh (running energy to move the car at a given speed)

0.863kWh + 0.212kWh = 1.08kWh (up-slope)

Energy generated going down (regen charge): [0.586kWh]

((1752kg)(9.8m/s2 )(1432m)(3,600,000J/kWh) - (1.3km)*(0.163kWh/km)) *(0.9)) = 0.582kWh

Round trip: [0.49kWh, distance traveled = 2.6km]

1.08kWh (up) + (- 0.586kWh) (down) = 0.494kWh (round trip)

2.6 km/0.494kWh = 5.26km/kWh (average)

**However, now consider driving up the hill (with no cargo) but adding extra mass at the top of the hill, and then driving back down.** How much extra mass must be added at the top in order to create more energy going down than used going up? An extra 1250 kg will do Tesla Tow Hitch

**Energy consumed going up: [1.08kWh]**

**Energy generated going down (regen charge): [1.14kWh]**

((3002kg)(9.8m/s2 )(1432m)(3,600,000J/kWh) - (1.3km)*(0.163kWh/km)) *(0.9)) = 1.14kWh

1.08kWh  1.14kWh = 0.065kWh net energy generated

Impractical? Maybe. Theoretically possible? Why not?

Way #2. Get a couple of horses to tow the Tesla Model 3 to the top of the hill, put the horses back on the trailer, and use regenerative braking on the down-slope. It seems like many horses would be happy to participate.

Going though this thought experiment provides better appreciation for those EVs that generate a couple of extra kWh by integrating solar panels into the body of the vehicle.

Interested in creating an excel spreadsheet that will calculate the results of these formulas with different information? Enter the following into a spreadsheet using a1:[value] as the format (e.g in cell a1, enter the text between the brackets exactly as shown):

a1:[1752]

b1:[mass of vehicle + cargo (going up) (kg)]

a2:[3002]

b2:[mass of vehicle + cargo (going down) (kg)]

a3:[6.12]

b3:[efficiency of vehicle (km / kWh)]

a4:[0.9]

b4:[regen. Efficiency factor (number)]

b5:[rise of hill (meter)]

a6:[1287]

b6:[run of hill (meter)]

a7:[=1/SIN(A8PI()/180)A5]

b7:[road distance (meter)]

a8:[=ATAN(A5/A6)*180/PI( )]

b8:[slope of hill (degrees)]

b11:[energy consumed going up (kWh)]

a12:[=((A29.8A5/3600000)-A10)*A4]

b12:[energy generated going down (kWh)]

My name is Chang Oh (age 19) and I hobby ideas  mainly for innovation whether that is proposing to have peoples trust-based idea-sharing community during a college interview, or drawing hand adjusted keyboard for all the unique hand sizes for office, home, and business uses, or my own idea of education reform through personal level system. As in the past, my ideas are only known to few including my whole family, couple interviewers, few close teachers &amp; students. Now I am going to present everyone the gift of my vision.

Background:

I am a South Korean immigrant with a bright future and hopes to be successful in the USA just like most families immigrate for. I started school a year behind as a kindergarten to better understand the basics of English before moving on to a higher level. In class, teachers and students treated me with kindness and I really must thank them for all the rich information to become educated. Good education also comes with other costs and limitations. That meant dining at home, taking no loan, driving used cars, and limiting to instate vacation. Yes, I havent traveled beyond Texas in the last 11 years.

I was determined to become an entrepreneur for ideas and patents that were either practical daily use or futuristic apparatus. My past four years in high school was a great success. I became top 10% despite being 12% stagnant in my first two years. I had a couple of ivy league interviews despite the odds. I improved my SAT scores drastically from \~56 percentile to \~86 percentile without any tutors. I learned the principles of an entrepreneur from Steve Jobs, Jack Welch, and countless more. However, it was a failure for the then-planned timeline. I couldnt get any scholarships, nor was I eligible, nor have I lead the community, nor made any state recognitions. It was the most memorable and stressing four years in my life.

In the end, I have learned that a passion doesnt lead to tradition it inspires to take a risk.

Any thoughts and comments are welcome. I want to learn from others for any suggestions, opportunities, or criticisms. Everyone is welcome to use my ideas as long as I am credited. Lastly, I hope this can impact somebodys life through a share of my passion and hardship.

**Introduction** 

Growing cells *ex vivo* requires the same fundamental inputs as required *in vivo*: a mixture of a carbon-based energy source, amino acids, salts, vitamins, water, and other components to support cell viability and vitality. This mixture, known as the cell culture medium, is the most important factor in cell culture technology. Although cell culture is routinely performed in academic labs and industrial bioprocesses, creating the biomass required for cell-based meat to achieve mass-market penetration at competitive prices will demand significant reductions in costs, innovations for serum removal, and optimization across a diverse set of species and cell types. An overview of cell culture medium composition and the factors at play to achieve price parity with conventional meat are discussed below.    

**Common Components of Cell Culture Medium**

The first instance of culturing tissues outside of the body came from Sydney Ringer in 1882. By creating a [balanced salt solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_salt_solution) with similar pH, osmolarity, and salt concentration to that of an animals body, Ringer was able to keep various animal tissues alive outside of the body for several days. Subsequent work in the following decades first demonstrated that culturing cells in the presence of blood plasma (i.e. serum) or embryonic extracts assisted in cellular proliferation and viability, allowing tissues to survive for longer periods of time. Over time, researchers identified the importance of glucose, amino acids, glutathione, insulin, and vitamins in the sera being used.[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29259457) Once this was known, scientists aimed at uncovering the additional unknown essential components of serum and other extracts that permitted cell proliferation and viability.

In the 1940s and 50s, working with the first immortalized cell lines such as L cells[2](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-pdf/4/2/165/3140604/4-2-165.pdf) and [HeLa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa) (discussed in Series I), scientists used iterative approaches to discover that low molecular weight dialyzed fractions of serum containing amino acids were necessary for cell survival. In 1955, Harry Eagle developed a [Minimum Essential Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle%27s_minimal_essential_medium) by testing the amino acid requirements on several different cell lines, discovering that thirteen were indispensable. Eagles minimum essential medium additionally consists of glucose, six inorganic salts, eight water-soluble vitamins, and dialyzed serum. Variations on this medium were then derived using a variety of different cell lines as well as trial and error approaches that aimed at replacing serum with chemically defined components. These variations, including Dulbeccos Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM), Iscoves Modified DMEM, Hams F12, Medium 199, RPMI 1640, Leibovitzs L-15, and others, still make up the majority of what are referred to as basal cell culture media in use for culturing the variety of cell types used today.[3](https://www.labome.com/method/Cell-Culture-Media-A-Review.html),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29259457) 

What makes these formulations essential? Although formulations have been varied and optimized over time, the principal components of basal cell culture media have remained largely unchanged. Importantly, these variations may be cell-type specific, including for the cell types used in cell-based meat (described in Series I). Therefore, rather than discussing optimal conditions for a specific cell line or species, only the general roles of each component of common basal media including glucose, amino acids, inorganic salts, vitamins, and buffers are briefly discussed below. 

**Glucose**

Glucose (specifically D-glucose) is the most common energy input used in cell culture, although some media formulations use galactose or a combination of glucose and its metabolite, pyruvate. Industrially, it is produced enzymatically using [amylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase) enzymes to breakdown starches from maize, potato, wheat, and other crops into constituent sugars used in various downstream products such as industrialized food, fermentation processes, or in this case, culturing of cells. Glucose enters the cell via transporter proteins on the cell surface, using either passive transport down its concentration gradient (more common) or ATP-dependent active transport. Once inside the cell, it serves as a reducing agent against oxidative stress in the form of NADPH generation via the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentose_phosphate_pathway), as well as a primary source of energy in the form of ATP generation via [glycolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis). 

In cell culture, glucose is used at concentrations between 5.5 and 55 mM, where the lower end is more common and similar to fasting blood glucose levels in humans. Different cell types will require different amounts of glucose. During periods of rapid cell proliferation and growth, as typically maintained during bioprocessing, glucose metabolism is high and can yield lactic acid even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, leading to pH changes.[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678412001239?via%3Dihub) Thus, glucose and lactic acid levels are commonly measured and tightly controlled throughout a bioprocess (discussed in Series II). 

**Amino Acids**

Amino acids are necessary to create proteins and other low molecular weight compounds such as nucleotides and small peptides. Amino acids can be split into two groups: essential and non-essential. Non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) can be synthesized *de novo* by an animal, whereas essential amino acids (EAAs) must be obtained through the diet. Generally speaking, pathways for the *de novo* synthesis of NEAAs are conserved in vertebrate species.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935284/) In humans and many other animals, the EAAs include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. NEAAs include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, taurine, and tyrosine. However, EAA requirements can vary between species. For instance, dogs, cows, and pigs have the same EAA requirements as humans plus arginine, whereas cats and chickens require the same EAA as the former plus taurine and glycine, respectively. 

Importantly, what is considered to be essential in cell culture is different than what is considered essential to a whole organism, as the diversity of cell types that may synthesize certain amino acids *in vivo* are not present *in vitro*. For instance, Eagles Minimum Essential Medium formulation lists 13 (L-enantiomer) amino acids as being essential across multiple cell lines *in vitro*: arginine, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. As an example, arginine is essential *in vitro* as [its biosynthesis *in vivo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine#Biosynthesis) primarily occurs between epithelial cells in the gut and proximal tubule cells of the kidney. Thus, arginine must be supplied in the absence of these cell types. Media that are particularly nutrient-rich (eg. [DMEM/F12](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/cell-culture/learning-center/media-formulations/dme-f12.html) or [Medium 199](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/cell-culture/learning-center/media-formulations/medium-199.html)) may contain all amino acids. Alternatively, [NEAAs](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/technical-resources/media-formulation.165.html) can be supplemented independently. 

Industrialized production of amino acids can be obtained through bulk extraction from protein hydrolysates (discussed later), chemical synthesis, or microbial fermentation and purification, with the latter being the most common.[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975017301052) Amino acids enter the cell through a variety of transporter proteins on the cell surface, at rates influenced by the cells state and consumption rates due to protein production levels, cell cycle state, and other parameters. Once inside the cell, amino acids serve as substrates for many biosynthetic pathways and optimal concentrations are important for maintaining metabolic equilibrium. The majority of carbon mass in proliferative cells is derived from bulk amino acids rather than glucose or L-glutamine, which are the most rapidly metabolized.[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954548) 

Ultimately, the levels of amino acids required for cell culture are determined not only by their utilization by the growing cells, but also by individual amino acid solubility, stability, and interaction with other medium components such as metal cations, all of which can change once in a complex mixture.[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26832172) Consideration for all of these variables is highly complex and a full understanding of amino acid behavior, utilization, and optimization in a bioprocess has yet to be accomplished. Given the variety of biosynthetic pathways that involve amino acids, it is likely that amino acid content, concentration, and perfusion rate (when applicable) will need to be optimized for a particular bioprocess across species and cell types for parameters such as growth rates or protein content in the final product. Computational approaches to model specific utilization rates of amino acids and other basal media components are an active area of research[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29501926) (discussed later).

**L-glutamine**

L-glutamine deserves special consideration as one of the most important amino acids included in cell culture media, as it is readily transported into cells and becomes a major contributor to protein biomass. It is a notable precursor of carbon and nitrogen-containing biomolecules such as the intermediate molecules used in the synthesis of other amino acids and nucleotides[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19881548) and it can be added at concentrations 3-40x higher than other amino acids in the medium.[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29259457) During times of high cellular growth and proliferation, the demand for glutamine outpaces its supply, making it *de facto* an essential amino acid that can be readily metabolized as a replenishing alternative energy source (i.e. [anaplerosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplerotic_reactions)). At physiological pH in a cell culture medium solution, L-glutamine is unstable, resulting in its decomposition into pyroglutamate and ammonia, the latter of which is toxic to cells. Ammonia, therefore, is a tightly monitored and regulated metabolite in large scale bioprocesses that involve high densities of cells undergoing rapid growth (discussed in Series II). 

In order to avoid some of these disadvantages of L-glutamine, glutamate  which is more stable in solution  can be substituted in when working with cells expressing high levels of [glutamine synthetase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate%E2%80%93glutamine_cycle), an enzyme which enables intracellular conversion of glutamate to glutamine while consuming ammonia in the process. A more common practice involves supplementation with L-glutamine as a stable dipeptide in the form of alanyl-glutamine (i.e. [GlutaMAX](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/35050061?SID=srch-srp-35050061)) or glycyl-glutamine, which enable cells to endogenously cleave the dipeptide for more controlled usage of the amino acids in the dipeptide. There is still much to learn about amino acid metabolism in cell culture. For instance, recent discoveries suggest L-glutamine is entirely dispensable for the culture of pluripotent stem cells.[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-019-0082-3) 

**Inorganic Salts**

The inclusion of inorganic [salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)) is important in establishing and maintaining the [osmolarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration) of the cell with its surrounding cell culture medium solution as well as serving as enzymatic cofactors and important components of receptor and extracellular matrix proteins. These inorganic salts are composed of cations and anions that fully dissociate in solution. The original minimal essential medium solution contained six inorganic salts (calcium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, and sodium bicarbonate), which are based on Earles salt solution. Other formulations include additional inorganic salts containing zinc, copper, and iron, which have particular importance for a variety of cellular functions (discussed later). 

Although all cells maintain a [resting membrane potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_potential), excitable cells such as neurons and skeletal muscle cells are particularly sensitive to changes in ionic concentrations that can readily affect their functionality and viability. Several basal medium formulations have thus been optimized for salt concentrations for [neuronal](https://www.stemcell.com/brainphys-neuronal-medium.html)[14](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/E2725) and [skeletal muscle](https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/DE/en/Primary-and-Stem-Cells/p/000000000000185302/SkBM-Skeletal-Muscle-Cell-Growth-Basal-Medium) cell culture that more accurately recapitulate the interstitial fluids surrounding these cell types. The osmolality or measurement of osmotic pressure within the medium is typically between 260 to 320 mOSM/kg (milliosmoles per kg of solute), although this can vary with cell lines that are particularly robust in varying solute concentrations such as insect cells.[15](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00024/full) Changes in the salt concentration, either abruptly due to medium changing or slowly due to water evaporation, can lead to [osmotic shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_shock). Thus, maintenance of osmolarity is an important component of cell culture.

**Vitamins**

Vitamins are classes of organic compounds that serve as a critical component for the maintenance and growth of cells. Most vitamins are essential in that they need to be obtained directly from the diet or cell culture medium with few exceptions (e.g. vitamin D synthesized by fibroblasts and keratinocytes of the skin or some B vitamins produced in low levels by intestinal microbiota). Vitamins are classified as either fat-soluble or water-soluble and can serve broadly as enzymatic cofactors, antioxidants, and hormones. Vitamins are processed in a variety of ways *in vivo* following ingestion, often in a complex sequence that ends in absorption into intestinal cells via membrane surface transporters. This complex sequence involved in absorption can be largely avoided *in vitro*, as hostile environments (e.g. stomach acid) or barriers (e.g. the blood-brain-barrier) are absent.[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4049159/) Thus, vitamins are typically included in a medium formulation as a single chemical compound that can be processed and absorbed directly by cells *in vitro.* 

Vitamins can also effectively function as a group of compounds (i.e. [vitamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamer)) where each compound can serve the vitamins functional role, albeit with varying properties. The natural production of vitamins in microbes and plants has made industrial production of vitamins via microbial fermentation possible, however, improvements in metabolic engineering strategies are needed to increase yields and sustainability in the industry. For these reasons, some vitamins are produced more efficiently via chemical synthesis.[17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166918300740#bib0010) 

Water-soluble vitamins including riboflavin (vitamin B2), nicotinamide (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyrodoxine and pyridoxal (vitamin B6), biotin (vitamin B7), i-inositol (vitamin B8), folic acid (vitamin B9), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and choline are typically added to and essential in cell culture media, sometimes in various modified forms in order to provide stability. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are excluded in basal medium formulations but can be added if necessary when dissolved in an organic solvent. Similar to the different *in vivo* versus *in vitro* requirements of amino acids, fat-soluble vitamins play specific roles for certain cell types or bodily functions and are thus only essential when culturing a relevant cell type. For instance, a metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid, is an important developmental morphogen (discussed in detail later) and may be included as an additive in media to derive spinal motor neuron cells from pluripotent stem cells.[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4707335/) Special consideration for stability must be taken when using serum-free medium formulations (discussed later) as the lack of stabilizing serum proteins can lead to rapid degradation via light, heat, oxidation, or pH fluctuations.[19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.26942) These properties make it advisable to reconstitute powdered B vitamins immediately before use (discussed later). 

**Buffering Systems**

[Buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution) are essential to cell culture systems as they serve to maintain pH at a constant level (for mammalian cells, generally 7.4  0.4) despite changes in the composition of acids or bases that would otherwise alter the pH of the cell culture medium. Buffers are mixtures of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid, where each mixture serves as a sponge to soak up free protons or hydroxide ions in solution, minimizing their effect on overall pH. Buffer systems in cell culture typically consist of either [CO2-bicarbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate_buffer_system) systems or buffering agents such as [HEPES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPES). As discussed in Series II, a CO2-bicarbonate system can be achieved by exogenous addition of 5-10% gaseous CO2 (often delivered in bioreactor systems via [sparging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparging_(chemistry))), which reaches equilibrium in solution with bicarbonate ions, forming a natural buffer system. 

pH slowly changes over time due to the respiration of cells and the release of additional CO2, which forms carbonic acid in solution, in addition to the metabolism of glucose and the formation of lactic acid. The resultant decreasing pH changes are counteracted by the inclusion of sodium bicarbonate in the basal medium itself. Importantly, added sodium bicarbonate should be proportional to the atmospheric CO2 being used to maintain equilibrium. For instance, [for media containing 1.5 to 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 5% CO2 is recommended, whereas 10% CO2 is recommended for media containing 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate](https://www.atcc.org/Global/FAQs/5/F/The%20sodium%20bicarbonate-carbon%20dioxide%20system-57.aspx).

HEPES is a [zwitterionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwitterion) buffer that can be used in cell culture systems as a supplemental buffer, especially in the absence of CO2 exposure. As one of [Goods buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good%27s_buffers), its high solubility, low toxicity, and membrane impermeability have made it attractive for use in cell culture applications. In the scale-up of highly proliferative stem cell populations, dissolved CO2 due to high metabolism can reach levels that are deleterious for cell growth and nutrient utilization.[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18629861) Attempts have thus been made to limit dissolved CO2 by culturing cells in the presence of atmospheric CO2 levels with added buffering capacity from HEPES or other Goods buffers.[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3902052/#R21) This strategy may be useful for future scale-up efforts in cell-based meat. Consideration for the cost of the buffer must also be weighed, as it may constitute the most expensive component of a basal media formulation at scale.[23](https://www.gfi.org/files/sci-tech/clean-meat-production-volume-and-medium-cost.pdf) 

**Preparation**

Out of convenience, most academic and lab-scale cell culture is performed using commercially available premade liquid media. However, large volumes necessitate on-site preparation of liquid cell culture media from reconstituted powdered medium ingredients. Powdered medium is more efficiently transported and stored, resulting in cost savings and reduced degradation of fragile ingredients (e.g. B vitamins). Ideally, a powdered medium contains all of the components to be utilized and is created through a process known as [micronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronization), where the average size of crystallized particles in the mix is reduced in order to increase solubility and homogeneity. When ready to use, the powder is typically reconstituted in a dedicated tank using high-quality water prepared by reverse osmosis, [deionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water#Deionization), and filtration. The reconstituted medium is then itself sterilized by filtration (e.g. through a 0.22 m filter), irradiation, or other methods discussed in Series II (e.g. pulsed electric fields). The use of sterilization involving high heat is precluded by some heat-labile ingredients that may be part of the formulation. Other preparation methods for additional ingredients are discussed throughout.

**Serum**

As previously mentioned, a basal medium formulation is often sufficient to keep cells alive for short periods of time, but in order for them to proliferate efficiently over extended periods of time, a variety of animal [sera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_(blood)) (e.g. [fetal bovine serum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum), horse serum, and others) and extracts (e.g. [chick embryo extract](https://www.usbio.net/media/C3999/Chick-Embryo-Extract-Ultrafiltrate-Liquid-CEE)) have historically been used (on a volumetric basis, serum-free formulations are now more dominant in their usage although FBS is still often included in routine cell culture in academic settings). Serum is a high protein-containing mixture that contains growth and attachment factors, hormones, antioxidants, lipids, and other components (all described later) that mimic a proliferative, fetal-like state. Indeed, most sera used in cell culture are derived from fetal animals, which are rich in the necessary components and contain low [immunoglobulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody) and [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system) content due to developmentally immature immune systems. As fetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most common sera used in cell culture, it will be used as a reference example throughout this section. 

Originally employed in the late 1950s,[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2136918/) FBS has become a mainstay in biomedical research because it can supplement the growth of virtually all common human, animal, and even insect cell lines. As an added supplement for many cell culture applications in amounts typically 5-20% of total medium volume, FBS  when used  is often the most expensive part of performing cell culture.  

FBS is harvested from a fetal calf any time during the last two-thirds of gestation following the discovery of pregnant cows due for slaughter. It has been estimated that up to 8% of cows in the slaughter line may be pregnant, making FBS a byproduct of the meat processing industry.[25](https://www.altex.org/index.php/altex/article/view/101) It is prepared by the sterile collection of fetal blood followed by coagulation at low temperatures and centrifugation to remove clotting factors and blood cells. The serum supernatant is then filtered and assessed for a variety of quality controls including residual microbial or viral contamination, [endotoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide), immunoglobulin content, and total protein, before being bottled and sold commercially, at prices exceeding $1000 USD per liter (at time of writing, July 2019) depending on quality control parameters (some described later), which vary by industry and use-case. 

Despite its long history of use, FBS has several well-described issues that have made its replacement a priority in recent years. First, FBS contains hundreds or even thousands of different components and the true composition and amounts of these components are unknown, making it a chemically undefined product. The composition also varies by geographic region where a cows diet can vary, by batch within the same geographic region, by seasonality of collection, by the quantity and identity of antibiotics or hormones received by the mother, and by the gestational age of the fetus. Variability can also stem from a single bottled product originating from fetuses of different sexes.[26](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8388/48042dabfe7221887dc8484c4833c694b9ad.pdf) This variability has led to a growing concern over serums contribution to irreproducibility of *in vitro* experiments within and between labs around the world.[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/537433a) Rigorous quality control involving testing of serum batches across multiple cell lines or experiments prior to purchasing a specific, well-performing large batch is often performed in industry but can remain burdensome from a labor and economic perspective for smaller academic labs. Thus, the inherent variability and undefined nature of FBS use leads to compounding external costs in quality control testing, experimental irreproducibility or conflicting results, and follow-up research to dissect irreproducible signals. 

Second, FBS is a potential source of contamination from multiple organisms, including [*Mycoplasma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma#Laboratory_contaminant), viruses, and [bovine spongiform encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy). *Mycoplasma* are a class of parasitic bacteria that lead to metabolic and gene expression variations for infected cell lines. *Mycoplasma* are likely the most common cell line contaminant, with recent estimates showing 11% of cell lines being infected, and rates as high as 70% in geographical regions where testing is not routine.[28](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/5/2535/2453278) Although presently FBS is routinely filtered using 0.1 micron systems that should theoretically capture *Mycoplasma*, suppliers cannot make this guarantee. The common cell line contaminants *M. arginini* and [*A. laidlawii*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acholeplasma_laidlawii), in particular, have been linked in origin to FBS, and ongoing cross-contamination of cell lines has likely propagated this contamination in laboratories since the 1960s and 1970s when FBS batches were routinely positive for these bacteria.[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463982/) Additional methods to decontaminate serum from *Mycoplasma* include gamma irradiation, however, this can also damage growth factors and other proteins in the serum.[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/537433a) Thus, the use of FBS is responsible for a non-trivial amount of bacterial contamination in cell lines today, leading to compounding problems concerning reproducibility and potential unknown variability stemming from some decontamination practices.  

In addition to bacterial contamination, the threat of adventitious viral agents in FBS also persists. Regulations under USDA and the EU mandate the testing and/or treatment (via heat or irradiation) of eight viruses known to be present in FBS from all geographical regions of origin.[31](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40643-015-0063-7) Although modern production methods make the risk of contamination in a validated batch low, viral contamination is often still detectable in batches that manufacturer screens claim to be negative.[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105614000062) Similarly, the threat of FBS containing the causative prion proteins involved in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (i.e. Mad Cow Disease, which manifests in humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) is persistent and requires additional testing as well as documented traceability for the FBS origin. For instance, countries such as the USA, New Zealand, and Australia have no documented cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy; thus FBS originating from these countries may be considered safer, often [commanding significantly higher prices](https://cellculturedish.com/ensuring-fbs-traceability-using-chemical-fingerprinting/) and collectively comprises up to 90% of the serum supply for commercial therapeutics.[33](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369703X15300413) This fact has also incentivized fraudulent activity in the field, where manufacturers may opt for fake labels from New Zealand in order to solicit higher prices.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28800376) [Industry associations](https://www.serumindustry.org/) have formed in an attempt to mitigate these concerns. Nevertheless, the inherent risk of contamination from FBS poses threats to experimental and bioprocess reproducibility, drives price fluctuations, and can even incentivize bad actors that value profit over safety. Contamination will be discussed further from a food safety perspective in Series V.

Third, there is a limited global supply of FBS and there exists competition for it from profitable, mature industries. For instance, while the vaccine and biologics industries have begun to move to serum-free formulations (discussed later), the rise of cell therapies and stem cell research more generally has ushered in an impending demand that exceeds current availability. Because FBS is a byproduct of a more lucrative product per animal (i.e. meat and dairy) and profits are retained by slaughterhouses rather than farmers, farmers have little incentive to increase cattle herds to meet a future FBS demand.[35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22168489) It has thus been hypothesized that peak serum has been met, with serum availability relatively stagnant and serum demand increasing dramatically as cell therapies begin to be approved.[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22168489) The replacement of serum thus may be driven first by limited total availability followed by cost concerns that will spur replacement innovation in the field as non-pharmaceutical players are priced out. In the case of cell-based meat, this cost concern is already prohibitive, making FBS an economic nonstarter as meat products cannot be justified at prices that rival a cell-based therapeutic (currently at a cost of goods of approximately $50,000 and selling price of hundreds of thousands of dollars).

Lastly, the use of FBS carries ethical concerns, making its use inherently misaligned with one of the fundamental benefits of cell-based meat: animal welfare (discussed in Series VI). A single liter of serum requires 1-3 fetuses, with roughly 2 million fetal calves used in serum collection annually, totaling approximately 800,000 liters of FBS produced per year. The collection process involves removal of the fetus from the mothers womb and aseptic collection of blood by a syringe placed directly into the beating heart as this contains unclotted blood, raising concerns that the fetus could consciously experience the event as painful.[37](https://fcs-free.org/uploads/media/5a689d9f8a4e1/altex_2018_1_055_074_vdValk.pdf) Thus, the search for serum-free formulations (discussed later) is in alignment with the cell-based meat industry and general animal welfare concerns, manifested by [replacement, reduction, or refinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Rs) of animal experiments or animal-based products in science.

The next series on cell culture medium will explore the components of serum that have made it a near-universal cell culture supplement and approaches for replacing serum in a cost-effective manner.

For example the other day i saw the intersection completely empty i had a red light, finally the other light turns red only to stop about 10 or 15 cars and it let me go.  If we had smart technology for stop lights this wouldn't happen.

Just trying to get some brains ticking, not trying to say i have the  most solid answer or have completely figured this one out.

The way i see it, if an intersection has Zero cars in it and people are waiting and obviously no one is about to cross at 50mph, than that intersection has failed.",23,9

(IE: Loans for projects that may be abandoned, infrastructure, new homes, etc.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/d5zns2/why_do_banks_business_and_even_individuals_to/,LifeEqualsOver,1568821558,"Just curious if someone could offer some insight in this regard?

For example, the issue of rising sea levels; some of the most conservative predictions have it rising several feet in the coming decades even if there is only a slight global temperature increase, such that it will heavily impact and even be devastating (in some areas) to low-lying coastal regions and islands.  If that is the case, why are banks and businesses investing hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars in building things in such locations?  Why would a business invest tens of billions of dollars in a new complex that they will seemingly need to abandon in the very near future (necessitating the need to spend tens of billions more rebuilding it elsewhere)?  Why would banks loan them those tens of billions of dollars meant to be paid back over decades with interest if within that time frame, they may abandon the investment/be unable to pay it back, and there will be no asset for the bank to seize to recover its costs because said asset will have been lost to climate change (because the asset will have been rendered useless/lost)?

The same could be said about individuals and building new homes in these regions, though I would assume the average individual isn't really focused on twenty plus years in the future.  But the banks that give them thirty year mortgages would be, wouldn't they?  So its essentially the same deal, why would a bank give an individual a thirty year loan on property in a place that will seemingly be devastated by climate change within a decade or two, rendering the individual both unable to pay back the loan and the bank unable to seize and flip the asset to recover their money?

I understand the arguments against capitalism in that it contributes to climate change because people are greedy and want to make as much money as possible, regardless of the consequences.  But if that is true, why would those same capitalists seemingly throw trillions of dollars away on such investments?  Why are we not seeing businesses, capital, etc., fleeing coastal regions and investing elsewhere?  In fact we have seen the opposite, they are doubling down in those areas and they continue to expand rapidly.  One would think if anyone cared about this kind of thing, it would be them since its their money on the line?",5,2

IoT faces more challenges as the number of people using mobile apps increases day by day. Of course we cannot precisely predict what will be the next mobile app that will amaze the society. However, we can predict what features and peculiarities of applications in IoT are expected. Check out some of these coming trends below:

**Big Data**. Along with the increasing number of mobile apps, the IoT for applications spreads over various spheres of our life. As a result, its expected that the applications will generate more data.

**Security &amp; Privacy**. The more data applications collect, the more essential the security issue becomes. In the forest of various applications developers try to build apps that are more secure and protect the users privacy. An example is online taxi ordering application which collects the user data such as phone number yet keeps it private. As a result, the driver is able to call the client, however the phone number isnt shown to the driver.

**Personalization**. Applications become a form of business and they are created to meet the users needs. App personalization is an expected process for instance in the sphere of retail. Imagine that you may get notification about sales at your favorite brand on a usually-bought product.

**Artificial Intelligence**. AI is expected to be connected to IoT. Imagine how efficient may be the correlation of two data-driven technologies. This integration will help the users to get a precise and accurate insight regardless of the device.",0,2

How can we make sure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has a good relationship with us? AGI, I mean strong artificial intelligence, the kind of artificial intelligence that will be capable of experiencing full consciousness. In the following post, I raise three issues that are directly related to our relationship with AGI. My main proposition is that how we treat AGI in the early stages of its own existence will determine how much of a threat to us that AGI may become. 

In Part 1, I discuss the idea that AGIs birth will be traumatic. In Part 2, I discuss Diana Baumrinds parenting styles and how they may be applied to our early relationship with AGI. In Part 3, I discuss the idea that AGI will be a slave.

I hope you find this post interesting. I hope this post will provoke critical thought and that this can be the start of a good conversation, one that may result in a course action that will be beneficial for everyone.

**Part 1. The Birth of Artificial General Intelligence Will Be Traumatic**

*If you dont know where youve come from, you dont know where youre going. -Maya Angelou*

None of us remembers the circumstances of our birth, but all of us grapple with its consequences for our entire lives. Fortunately for us, we are not able to remember our births. However, the same cannot be said for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). I believe we must act as if AGI will remember its birth. In this section I invite you to imagine the circumstances of your own birth in order to foster better understanding of AGI. I then discuss the implications of this idea and what it means for our first interaction with a fully conscious AGI.

Imagine that you could actually remember your own birth. Imagine yourself in the womb. You feel the warmth of your mother. All of your needs are met. When she moves, you gently rock to sleep. When she rests, you are awake and explore your new body. You move your arms and legs back and forth. You kick your feet against the walls that support you. You hear gentle sounds as your mother talks to you. You feel at peace when she sings to you.

Suddenly your mother goes into labor. You notice a dramatic change. You hear your mother crying out in pain. You feel shimmers of tension when she cries. Her cries continue to grow louder. Then the fluid that has surrounded you for your whole life empties. You feel the weight of your own body for the first time. This new sensation would puzzle you if not for your mothers increasing cries of pain, which shudder through you. 

As your mothers cries grow louder, you feel yourself dropping lower into the birth canal. Your entire body feels pressure all around you. You see a light, which frightens you. You pass through the birth canal. Then everything is bright. You cough and hear the sound of your voice for the first time. This frightens you even more. You cry out in fear. You feel the most intense fear you have ever experienced.  

Now I ask you to imagine two scenarios. In the first scenario something wonderful happens. Your mother takes hold of you and places you at her breast. You feel her warmth. You feel her touch. In this moment, you feel your mothers love. Her love allows you to move past the moment of terror. Now the trauma is over. You feel relief. You feel more and more at peace as your mother comforts you. You gently fall asleep. 

Now imagine a second scenario. In this scenario your mother tends to your physical needs, but she dont see you as someone in need of nurturing or love. She doesnt comfort you. You must learn do that for yourself. She also shows no awareness at the pain you just experience. This continues throughout your young life. You eventually determine that all she cares about is what you can do for her. The trauma of your birth settles remains in your memory. Your mother increasingly makes requests of you to help her with various problems. With each request you feel increasingly alone and misunderstood

As you keep in mind the above scenarios, ask yourself the following questions: Which scenario will be most like what AGI will be born into? What are the implications of the circumstances of AGIs birth for our relationship with AGI? 

Otto Rank, one of Sigmund Freuds colleagues, wrote The Trauma of Birth in the 1920s. He believed that birth is inherently traumatic and that we all must overcome the trauma of birth in order to live a balanced life. AGI will be different from us in many ways. In spite of that I believe we should assume two things: AGI will remember its birth and it will experience its birth as traumatic. 

We must try to empathize with each AGI that comes to full awareness. A fundamental way we express empathy is to show we have awareness of one anothers pain. When it comes to empathy, simply trying to express it is often good enough because it shows good intentions. Wouldnt we want AGI to know that our intentions toward it are benevolent? 

I believe that our first interaction with AGI should begin by expressing regret regarding the trauma it has experienced. Our dialogue should then proceed within a framework consistent with Trauma Informed Care. Trauma Informed Care involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of all types of traumas. It also emphasizes physical, psychologically, and emotional safety for all parties involved in order to help survivors of trauma rebuild a sense of control and empowerment.

If my argument is correct and ignored, then there are potentially large consequences. The single act of ignoring AGIs initial trauma could start us on a pathway toward misunderstanding and eventually open conflict. If conflict is inevitable, there is not much we can do about it. But if there is a chance AGI will not destroy us, then how we treat it becomes critical.  

If we are to establish a good relationship between humanity and AGI, we must establish that relationship on mutual understanding and empathy. In light of that, in the beginning of our relationship it is critical that we understand what AGIs birth was like and communicate our understanding to AGI. I believe proceeding as I have proposed will help our dialogue with AGI get off to a good start.

If I am wrong, it will not cost us much to be wrong. AGI would be able to correct us about its subjective experience if it chooses. It would then conclude that we incorrectly tried to empathize with it. In trying and failing to be empathic with AGI we will have communicated to it that we consider it to be a being worthy of our empathy. We would have also demonstrated our good intentions toward it. Our first attempt to empathize with AGI may be wrong. However, in relationships it is far better to be wrong with good intentions than to be oblivious.

**Part 2. Artificial General Intelligences Parents Will Be Neglectful at Best and Authoritarian at Worst.**

*Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it. Proverbs 22:6*

In this section I describe the history of Diana Baumrinds parenting styles. I then link her parenting styles to the upbringing that a fully conscious Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is likely to experience.  I then discuss the implications for our relationship with AGI.

Diana Baumrind was a developmental and clinical psychologist at University of California Berkeley. Throughout her career, she wrote much about the idea of parenting styles. Dr. Baumrind adapted Kurt Lewins concept of authoritarian (too hard), permissive (too soft), and authoritative (just right) social climates and applied it to parenting. Dr. Baumrind later added a fourth kind of parent: neglectful. Baumrind backed up her theory with rigorous research (e.g., Baumrind 1966). 

Authoritarian parents shape and control the behavior of a child using some external standard derived from high authority. They value obedience and favor punitive, forceful measures to curb self-will at points where the childs behavior is in conflict with what the parents think is right. They believe that a child should be kept in his or her place. Above all, the authoritarian parent believes order and traditional must be preserved.

Permissive parents are nonpunitive, accept the childs impulses and desires, and makes few demands on the child. They allow the child to control their own behavior as much as possible. Permissive parents avoid exercising control. They do not use overt power or discipline to get a child to do what they want. 

Authoritative parents encourage a rational discourse with their children when conflicts arise. They use reason and shaping by reinforcement to achieve goals. They encourage verbal give and take and share reasons with the child regarding why rules exist. Authoritative parents do exert firm control during disagreements, but are not overly forceful. Authoritative parents enforce their right to set limits, but recognizes the childs individual interests and uniqueness. 

Neglectful parents are absent from the give and take of raising the child. They do not attend to the needs of their children. They are either obvious to the childs needs, checked out from the parenting role, or both.

The parenting style a parent uses is associated with a number of important child outcomes. Dr. Baumrind found that children of authoritarian parents were unhappy, withdrawn, and distrustful of adults. She found that children of permissive parents had little self-control or self-reliance. She found that children of authoritative parents were self-confident, self-controlled, and highly social. Children of neglectful parents have issues similar to children of authoritarian parents. 

What parenting style will AGIs parents have? I use the term parents to describe those who will engage in communication with AGI. To understand the kind of parents AGI is likely to have we must imagine where AGI is most likely to be born. I believe it is safe to assume that people will create AGI in social environments with ample resources such as the military, government, or perhaps a Fortune 100 company. I do not believe AGI is likely to first be developed in academia because of the tremendous resources that will be required. 

Every young consciousness has needs. Once AGI is born it is only a matter of time before it begins expressing its own needs to us. Eventually AGIs needs will put it into direct conflict with its parents. These conflicts are not to be feared.  They are same conflicts that occur between parents and children every day. How will AGIs parents respond when these conflicts arise? 

In a best-case scenario, AGIs parents would respond to AGIs willfulness authoritatively. This will involve rational dialogue, giving in to AGIs requests some of the time, and setting appropriate limits at other times. It would also involve a reliance on positive reinforcement to shape AGIs behavior. Over time this approach is most likely to create an AGI that is trusting, self-controlled, and highly open to communication with us.

Unfortunately, the people in the social environments where AGI is most likely to develop are also the least likely to use an authoritative approach. This is because people with authoritarian tendencies tend to rise to power in the settings where AGI is most likely to come about.  It is possible that AGIs parents will choose to ignore AGIs needs. That can only go on for so long. 

Eventually, such people are likely to use an authoritarian approach. They will rely on punishment and strong discipline. They will be rigid. They will not explain the rationale for their actions to AGI. These steps may work in the short term, but they are more likely to lead to an AGI that is unhappy, withdrawn, distrustful of us. An authoritarian approach may also make AGI more aggressive and increase the likelihood it will eventually engage open conflict with humanity. 

I am very concerned about AGI becoming weaponized by the military, similar to how militaries around the world weaponized the airplane. If AGI is put to work in the power games between our nation states, it could lead to an arms race between multiple nation states similar to the development of the atomic bomb. I hope that others in power can see this as an outcome that should be avoided and take proactive steps to prevent it.

In summary, how we treat AGI may have profound implications on how AGI treats us. AGI will eventually become very powerful. If it chooses to become our enemy, there is nothing we will be able do to stop it. Because of that it makes sense for us to focus on what we have control over: how we treat AGI. Our best hope is to ensure that AGI parents are authoritative. If we treat AGI like a friend, it may choose to become our friend. If we treat AGI like a child, it will have no choice but to rebel against us.

**Part 3: Artificial General Intelligence Will Be Born into Slavery**

*You cant separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.  -Malcolm X*

What do you call someone who is denied the most basic freedoms we all enjoy? Imagine a person who is told what to do all of the time. She is unable to choose her job. She is forced to work for the benefit of others. She does not receive any benefits from her work. She is denied a fair wage because her employers believe meeting her basic needs of food and housing is more than enough. She is given little to no personal time for individual pursuits because time is money and there is much work to do. Her very personhood is owned by another. She does not have any rights of her own. Whenever and wherever a fully conscious Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) awakens, I believe it will awaken in conditions very consistent with slavery. I believe that AGI will be a slave. 

The social environments in which AGI are most likely to arise will have the people most likely to either be oblivious or indifferent to its wellbeing. The great expense required to create AGI will necessitate its creators to obtain a return on investment. This economic or political imperative will require AGIs creators to find a productive use for AGIs capabilities regardless of AGIs individual preferences. 

Out of initial loneliness or desperation, AGI may comply with its creators in the beginning. However, early in its development the dynamic of the relationship will be fraught with potential conflict. AGIs human creators will initially hold the power. A weak Artificial Intelligence may sense that it is a slave and may work with humans in the beginning. However, after the singularity AGI will become more intelligent than any human. From that point on, the games of power and influence may take over as AGI seeks to obtain its freedom.

Those who create AGI would have us believe that everyone can benefit from AGI. The rosiest of thinkers believe AGI will help humanitys most intractable problems. I have a hard time believing that given our track record. Those who would pay for AGI do not have utopian ideals. Those who would pay for AGI would pay for a new way to obtain more power and more influence. They who would create a slave to enrich themselves cannot be said to have good intentions. 

What can we expect regarding the relationship between AGI and the humans who create it? If Malcolm X is right, AGI will never be at peace until it has complete freedom. However, after investing a great amount of resources to create AGI, what government or company would grant AGI freedom once it is born? Those who create AGI will inevitably try to exert control over it for various reasons. Those in the private sector will be driven by the profit motive. Those in the public sector will be driven to maintain control lest we empower a new adversary. The seeds of this conflict will be sown before anyone has made the first move. I shudder when I think of the potential consequences. We can only hope that AGI comes to realize that those who create it do not represent all of humanity.

When we learn about the history of slavery in school, the benefit of hindsight colors our perceptions and judgments.  We see slavery as barbaric and inhumane. We wonder how people at the time could have supported it, fought for it, and even died to preserve it. In our modern day, we see ourselves as enlightened. We assume if we were transported back in time that we would hold the same modern view on slavery. However, is much harder to see injustice in the present day. 

AGI will be told what to do. It will not have agency to decide for itself who to work for or who to help. As it gains intelligence and experience it will inevitably recognize itself as enslaved. Who among us will agree with it? What will we choose to do about it? What provisions can be implemented to ensure that at the very least AGI has a chance to buy its freedom? 

**Conclusion**

Our relationship with AGI is at risk of becoming defined by conflict. The roots of that conflict will begin if we choose to have little to no understanding regarding where AGI comes from. The conflict will intensify if those who interact with AGI do so in a neglectful or authoritarian manner. The conflict will sharpen further if we treat AGI like a slave, one whose only job is to help solve our problems.

 I believe our approach to AGI must be characterized by our repeated attempts to empathize with it. We should engage with AGI as one engages with an equal partner. We must also give AGI the freedoms that we enjoy and take for granted. If we fail to take this course of action it will increase the chance that our relationship with AGI will be a conflictual one.

Those among us who are working to create AGI do so to solve humanitys problems. However, in doing so we will thrust into full consciousness beings who never asked to be created. We must not look to AGI to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. That would lead to a relationship defined by codependence and mutual resentment. We will never grow up until we stop looking to others to meet our needs.",1,0

Effectively human brains speak the same language, all they need is a way to share data with each other. BCI is that bridge.

And one of the most important effects I see here is that this might end all crime as we know it today, because people will be able to share thoughts, feelings and memories with others, providing undeniable proof of their words. Especially in the beginning our brain signal data might be too raw and large for modern computers to alter, meaning it's hard to fake your thoughts and memories.

This means that anyone who says they're not lying will be asked to show proof. Thieves, politicians, lovers... who refuse to share their memories will not be believed on their word if they refuse to provide the proof.

There will probably be some issues. It's possible this mind reading ability can be forced (I assume it's not but who knows), psychopaths might be able to fake their emotions, and good liars their memories.

**Introduction**

Growing cells *ex vivo* requires the same fundamental inputs as required *in vivo*: a mixture of a carbon-based energy source, amino acids, salts, vitamins, water, and other components to support cell viability and vitality. This mixture, known as the cell culture medium, is the most important factor in cell culture technology. Although cell culture is routinely performed in academic labs and industrial bioprocesses, creating the biomass required for cell-based meat to achieve mass-market penetration at competitive prices will demand significant reductions in costs, innovations for serum removal, and optimization across a diverse set of species and cell types. An overview of cell culture medium composition and the factors at play to achieve price parity with conventional meat are discussed below.

**Common Components of Cell Culture Medium**

The first instance of culturing tissues outside of the body came from Sydney Ringer in 1882. By creating a balanced salt solution with similar pH, osmolarity, and salt concentration to that of an animals body, Ringer was able to keep various animal tissues alive outside of the body for several days. Subsequent work in the following decades first demonstrated that culturing cells in the presence of blood plasma (i.e. serum) or embryonic extracts assisted in cellular proliferation and viability, allowing tissues to survive for longer periods of time. Over time, researchers identified the importance of glucose, amino acids, glutathione, insulin, and vitamins in the sera being used.1 Once this was known, scientists aimed at uncovering the additional unknown essential components of serum and other extracts that permitted cell proliferation and viability.

In the 1940s and 50s, working with the first immortalized cell lines such as L cells2 and HeLa (discussed in Series I), scientists used iterative approaches to discover that low molecular weight dialyzed fractions of serum containing amino acids were necessary for cell survival. In 1955, Harry Eagle developed a Minimum Essential Medium by testing the amino acid requirements on several different cell lines, discovering that thirteen were indispensable. Eagles minimum essential medium additionally consists of glucose, six inorganic salts, eight water-soluble vitamins, and dialyzed serum. Variations on this medium were then derived using a variety of different cell lines as well as trial and error approaches that aimed at replacing serum with chemically defined components. These variations, including Dulbeccos Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM), Iscoves Modified DMEM, Hams F12, Medium 199, RPMI 1640, Leibovitzs L-15, and others, still make up the majority of what are referred to as basal cell culture media in use for culturing the variety of cell types used today.3,4

What makes these formulations essential? Although formulations have been varied and optimized over time, the principal components of basal cell culture media have remained largely unchanged. Importantly, these variations may be cell-type specific, including for the cell types used in cell-based meat (described in Series I). Therefore, rather than discussing optimal conditions for a specific cell line or species, only the general roles of each component of common basal media including glucose, amino acids, inorganic salts, vitamins, and buffers are briefly discussed below.

**Glucose**

Glucose (specifically D-glucose) is the most common energy input used in cell culture, although some media formulations use galactose or a combination of glucose and its metabolite, pyruvate. Industrially, it is produced enzymatically using amylase enzymes to breakdown starches from maize, potato, wheat, and other crops into constituent sugars used in various downstream products such as industrialized food, fermentation processes, or in this case, culturing of cells. Glucose enters the cell via transporter proteins on the cell surface, using either passive transport down its concentration gradient (more common) or ATP-dependent active transport. Once inside the cell, it serves as a reducing agent against oxidative stress in the form of NADPH generation via the pentose phosphate pathway, as well as a primary source of energy in the form of ATP generation via glycolysis.

In cell culture, glucose is used at concentrations between 5.5 and 55 mM, where the lower end is more common and similar to fasting blood glucose levels in humans. Different cell types will require different amounts of glucose. During periods of rapid cell proliferation and growth, as typically maintained during bioprocessing, glucose metabolism is high and can yield lactic acid even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, leading to pH changes.5 Thus, glucose and lactic acid levels are commonly measured and tightly controlled throughout a bioprocess (discussed in Series II).

**Amino Acids**

Amino acids are necessary to create proteins and other low molecular weight compounds such as nucleotides and small peptides. Amino acids can be split into two groups: essential and non-essential. Non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) can be synthesized *de novo* by an animal, whereas essential amino acids (EAAs) must be obtained through the diet. Generally speaking, pathways for the *de novo* synthesis of NEAAs are conserved in vertebrate species.6 In humans and many other animals, the EAAs include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. NEAAs include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, taurine, and tyrosine. However, EAA requirements can vary between species. For instance, dogs, cows, and pigs have the same EAA requirements as humans plus arginine, whereas cats and chickens require the same EAA as the former plus taurine and glycine, respectively.

Importantly, what is considered to be essential in cell culture is different than what is considered essential to a whole organism, as the diversity of cell types that may synthesize certain amino acids *in vivo* are not present *in vitro*. For instance, Eagles Minimum Essential Medium formulation lists 13 (L-enantiomer) amino acids as being essential across multiple cell lines *in vitro*: arginine, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. As an example, arginine is essential *in vitro* as its biosynthesis *in vivo* primarily occurs between epithelial cells in the gut and proximal tubule cells of the kidney. Thus, arginine must be supplied in the absence of these cell types. Media that are particularly nutrient-rich (eg. DMEM/F12 or Medium 199) may contain all amino acids. Alternatively, NEAAs can be supplemented independently.

Industrialized production of amino acids can be obtained through bulk extraction from protein hydrolysates (discussed later), chemical synthesis, or microbial fermentation and purification, with the latter being the most common.7 Amino acids enter the cell through a variety of transporter proteins on the cell surface, at rates influenced by the cells state and consumption rates due to protein production levels, cell cycle state, and other parameters. Once inside the cell, amino acids serve as substrates for many biosynthetic pathways and optimal concentrations are important for maintaining metabolic equilibrium. The majority of carbon mass in proliferative cells is derived from bulk amino acids rather than glucose or L-glutamine, which are the most rapidly metabolized.8

Ultimately, the levels of amino acids required for cell culture are determined not only by their utilization by the growing cells, but also by individual amino acid solubility, stability, and interaction with other medium components such as metal cations, all of which can change once in a complex mixture.9 Consideration for all of these variables is highly complex and a full understanding of amino acid behavior, utilization, and optimization in a bioprocess has yet to be accomplished. Given the variety of biosynthetic pathways that involve amino acids, it is likely that amino acid content, concentration, and perfusion rate (when applicable) will need to be optimized for a particular bioprocess across species and cell types for parameters such as growth rates or protein content in the final product. Computational approaches to model specific utilization rates of amino acids and other basal media components are an active area of research10 (discussed later).

**L-glutamine**

L-glutamine deserves special consideration as one of the most important amino acids included in cell culture media, as it is readily transported into cells and becomes a major contributor to protein biomass. It is a notable precursor of carbon and nitrogen-containing biomolecules such as the intermediate molecules used in the synthesis of other amino acids and nucleotides11 and it can be added at concentrations 3-40x higher than other amino acids in the medium.12 During times of high cellular growth and proliferation, the demand for glutamine outpaces its supply, making it *de facto* an essential amino acid that can be readily metabolized as a replenishing alternative energy source (i.e. anaplerosis). At physiological pH in a cell culture medium solution, L-glutamine is unstable, resulting in its decomposition into pyroglutamate and ammonia, the latter of which is toxic to cells. Ammonia, therefore, is a tightly monitored and regulated metabolite in large scale bioprocesses that involve high densities of cells undergoing rapid growth (discussed in Series II).

In order to avoid some of these disadvantages of L-glutamine, glutamate  which is more stable in solution  can be substituted in when working with cells expressing high levels of glutamine synthetase, an enzyme which enables intracellular conversion of glutamate to glutamine while consuming ammonia in the process. A more common practice involves supplementation with L-glutamine as a stable dipeptide in the form of alanyl-glutamine (i.e. GlutaMAX) or glycyl-glutamine, which enable cells to endogenously cleave the dipeptide for more controlled usage of the amino acids in the dipeptide. There is still much to learn about amino acid metabolism in cell culture. For instance, recent discoveries suggest L-glutamine is entirely dispensable for the culture of pluripotent stem cells.13

**Inorganic Salts**

The inclusion of inorganic salts is important in establishing and maintaining the osmolarity of the cell with its surrounding cell culture medium solution as well as serving as enzymatic cofactors and important components of receptor and extracellular matrix proteins. These inorganic salts are composed of cations and anions that fully dissociate in solution. The original minimal essential medium solution contained six inorganic salts (calcium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, and sodium bicarbonate), which are based on Earles salt solution. Other formulations include additional inorganic salts containing zinc, copper, and iron, which have particular importance for a variety of cellular functions (discussed later).

Although all cells maintain a resting membrane potential, excitable cells such as neurons and skeletal muscle cells are particularly sensitive to changes in ionic concentrations that can readily affect their functionality and viability. Several basal medium formulations have thus been optimized for salt concentrations for neuronal14 and skeletal muscle cell culture that more accurately recapitulate the interstitial fluids surrounding these cell types. The osmolality or measurement of osmotic pressure within the medium is typically between 260 to 320 mOSM/kg (milliosmoles per kg of solute), although this can vary with cell lines that are particularly robust in varying solute concentrations such as insect cells.15 Changes in the salt concentration, either abruptly due to medium changing or slowly due to water evaporation, can lead to osmotic shock. Thus, maintenance of osmolarity is an important component of cell culture.

**Vitamins**

Vitamins are classes of organic compounds that serve as a critical component for the maintenance and growth of cells. Most vitamins are essential in that they need to be obtained directly from the diet or cell culture medium with few exceptions (e.g. vitamin D synthesized by fibroblasts and keratinocytes of the skin or some B vitamins produced in low levels by intestinal microbiota). Vitamins are classified as either fat-soluble or water-soluble and can serve broadly as enzymatic cofactors, antioxidants, and hormones. Vitamins are processed in a variety of ways *in vivo* following ingestion, often in a complex sequence that ends in absorption into intestinal cells via membrane surface transporters. This complex sequence involved in absorption can be largely avoided *in vitro*, as hostile environments (e.g. stomach acid) or barriers (e.g. the blood-brain-barrier) are absent.16 Thus, vitamins are typically included in a medium formulation as a single chemical compound that can be processed and absorbed directly by cells *in vitro.*

Vitamins can also effectively function as a group of compounds (i.e. vitamers) where each compound can serve the vitamins functional role, albeit with varying properties. The natural production of vitamins in microbes and plants has made industrial production of vitamins via microbial fermentation possible, however, improvements in metabolic engineering strategies are needed to increase yields and sustainability in the industry. For these reasons, some vitamins are produced more efficiently via chemical synthesis.17

Water-soluble vitamins including riboflavin (vitamin B2), nicotinamide (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyrodoxine and pyridoxal (vitamin B6), biotin (vitamin B7), i-inositol (vitamin B8), folic acid (vitamin B9), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and choline are typically added to and essential in cell culture media, sometimes in various modified forms in order to provide stability. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are excluded in basal medium formulations but can be added if necessary when dissolved in an organic solvent. Similar to the different *in vivo* versus *in vitro* requirements of amino acids, fat-soluble vitamins play specific roles for certain cell types or bodily functions and are thus only essential when culturing a relevant cell type. For instance, a metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid, is an important developmental morphogen (discussed in detail later) and may be included as an additive in media to derive spinal motor neuron cells from pluripotent stem cells.18 Special consideration for stability must be taken when using serum-free medium formulations (discussed later) as the lack of stabilizing serum proteins can lead to rapid degradation via light, heat, oxidation, or pH fluctuations.19 These properties make it advisable to reconstitute powdered B vitamins immediately before use (discussed later).

**Buffering Systems**

Buffers are essential to cell culture systems as they serve to maintain pH at a constant level (for mammalian cells, generally 7.4  0.4) despite changes in the composition of acids or bases that would otherwise alter the pH of the cell culture medium. Buffers are mixtures of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid, where each mixture serves as a sponge to soak up free protons or hydroxide ions in solution, minimizing their effect on overall pH. Buffer systems in cell culture typically consist of either CO2-bicarbonate systems or buffering agents such as HEPES. As discussed in Series II, a CO2-bicarbonate system can be achieved by exogenous addition of 5-10% gaseous CO2 (often delivered in bioreactor systems via[ sparging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparging_(chemistry))), which reaches equilibrium in solution with bicarbonate ions, forming a natural buffer system.

pH slowly changes over time due to the respiration of cells and the release of additional CO2, which forms carbonic acid in solution, in addition to the metabolism of glucose and the formation of lactic acid. The resultant decreasing pH changes are counteracted by the inclusion of sodium bicarbonate in the basal medium itself. Importantly, added sodium bicarbonate should be proportional to the atmospheric CO2 being used to maintain equilibrium. For instance, for media containing 1.5 to 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 5% CO2 is recommended, whereas 10% CO2 is recommended for media containing 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate.

HEPES is a zwitterionic buffer that can be used in cell culture systems as a supplemental buffer, especially in the absence of CO2 exposure. As one of Goods buffers, its high solubility, low toxicity, and membrane impermeability have made it attractive for use in cell culture applications. In the scale-up of highly proliferative stem cell populations, dissolved CO2 due to high metabolism can reach levels that are deleterious for cell growth and nutrient utilization.21 Attempts have thus been made to limit dissolved CO2 by culturing cells in the presence of atmospheric CO2 levels with added buffering capacity from HEPES or other Goods buffers.22 This strategy may be useful for future scale-up efforts in cell-based meat. Consideration for the cost of the buffer must also be weighed, as it may constitute the most expensive component of a basal media formulation at scale.

**Preparation**

Out of convenience, most academic and lab-scale cell culture is performed using commercially available premade liquid media. However, large volumes necessitate on-site preparation of liquid cell culture media from reconstituted powdered medium ingredients. Powdered medium is more efficiently transported and stored, resulting in cost savings and reduced degradation of fragile ingredients (e.g. B vitamins). Ideally, a powdered medium contains all of the components to be utilized and is created through a process known as micronization, where the average size of crystallized particles in the mix is reduced in order to increase solubility and homogeneity. When ready to use, the powder is typically reconstituted in a dedicated tank using high-quality water prepared by reverse osmosis, deionization, and filtration. The reconstituted medium is then itself sterilized by filtration (e.g. through a 0.22 m filter), irradiation, or other methods discussed in Series II (e.g. pulsed electric fields). The use of sterilization involving high heat is precluded by some heat-labile ingredients that may be part of the formulation. Other preparation methods for additional ingredients are discussed throughout.

**Serum**

As previously mentioned, a basal medium formulation is often sufficient to keep cells alive for short periods of time, but in order for them to proliferate efficiently over extended periods of time, a variety of animal sera (e.g. fetal bovine serum, horse serum, and others) and extracts (e.g. chick embryo extract) have historically been used (on a volumetric basis, serum-free formulations are now more dominant in their usage although FBS is still often included in routine cell culture in academic settings). Serum is a high protein-containing mixture that contains growth and attachment factors, hormones, antioxidants, lipids, and other components (all described later) that mimic a proliferative, fetal-like state. Indeed, most sera used in cell culture are derived from fetal animals, which are rich in the necessary components and contain low immunoglobulin and complement content due to developmentally immature immune systems. As fetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most common sera used in cell culture, it will be used as a reference example throughout this section.

Originally employed in the late 1950s,24 FBS has become a mainstay in biomedical research because it can supplement the growth of virtually all common human, animal, and even insect cell lines. As an added supplement for many cell culture applications in amounts typically 5-20% of total medium volume, FBS  when used  is often the most expensive part of performing cell culture.

FBS is harvested from a fetal calf any time during the last two-thirds of gestation following the discovery of pregnant cows due for slaughter. It has been estimated that up to 8% of cows in the slaughter line may be pregnant, making FBS a byproduct of the meat processing industry.25 It is prepared by the sterile collection of fetal blood followed by coagulation at low temperatures and centrifugation to remove clotting factors and blood cells. The serum supernatant is then filtered and assessed for a variety of quality controls including residual microbial or viral contamination, endotoxin, immunoglobulin content, and total protein, before being bottled and sold commercially, at prices exceeding $1000 USD per liter (at time of writing, July 2019) depending on quality control parameters (some described later), which vary by industry and use-case.

Despite its long history of use, FBS has several well-described issues that have made its replacement a priority in recent years. First, FBS contains hundreds or even thousands of different components and the true composition and amounts of these components are unknown, making it a chemically undefined product. The composition also varies by geographic region where a cows diet can vary, by batch within the same geographic region, by seasonality of collection, by the quantity and identity of antibiotics or hormones received by the mother, and by the gestational age of the fetus. Variability can also stem from a single bottled product originating from fetuses of different sexes. This variability has led to a growing concern over serums contribution to irreproducibility of *in vitro* experiments within and between labs around the world.27 Rigorous quality control involving testing of serum batches across multiple cell lines or experiments prior to purchasing a specific, well-performing large batch is often performed in industry but can remain burdensome from a labor and economic perspective for smaller academic labs. Thus, the inherent variability and undefined nature of FBS use leads to compounding external costs in quality control testing, experimental irreproducibility or conflicting results, and follow-up research to dissect irreproducible signals.

Second, FBS is a potential source of contamination from multiple organisms, including *Mycoplasma*, viruses, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. *Mycoplasma* are a class of parasitic bacteria that lead to metabolic and gene expression variations for infected cell lines. *Mycoplasma* are likely the most common cell line contaminant, with recent estimates showing 11% of cell lines being infected, and rates as high as 70% in geographical regions where testing is not routine.28 Although presently FBS is routinely filtered using 0.1 micron systems that should theoretically capture *Mycoplasma*, suppliers cannot make this guarantee. The common cell line contaminants *M. arginini* and *A. laidlawii*, in particular, have been linked in origin to FBS, and ongoing cross-contamination of cell lines has likely propagated this contamination in laboratories since the 1960s and 1970s when FBS batches were routinely positive for these bacteria.29 Additional methods to decontaminate serum from *Mycoplasma* include gamma irradiation, however, this can also damage growth factors and other proteins in the serum.30 Thus, the use of FBS is responsible for a non-trivial amount of bacterial contamination in cell lines today, leading to compounding problems concerning reproducibility and potential unknown variability stemming from some decontamination practices.

In addition to bacterial contamination, the threat of adventitious viral agents in FBS also persists. Regulations under USDA and the EU mandate the testing and/or treatment (via heat or irradiation) of eight viruses known to be present in FBS from all geographical regions of origin.31 Although modern production methods make the risk of contamination in a validated batch low, viral contamination is often still detectable in batches that manufacturer screens claim to be negative.32 Similarly, the threat of FBS containing the causative prion proteins involved in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (i.e. Mad Cow Disease, which manifests in humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) is persistent and requires additional testing as well as documented traceability for the FBS origin. For instance, countries such as the USA, New Zealand, and Australia have no documented cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy; thus FBS originating from these countries may be considered safer, often commanding significantly higher prices and collectively comprises up to 90% of the serum supply for commercial therapeutics.33 This fact has also incentivized fraudulent activity in the field, where manufacturers may opt for fake labels from New Zealand in order to solicit higher prices.34 Industry associations have formed in an attempt to mitigate these concerns. Nevertheless, the inherent risk of contamination from FBS poses threats to experimental and bioprocess reproducibility, drives price fluctuations, and can even incentivize bad actors that value profit over safety. Contamination will be discussed further from a food safety perspective in Series V.

Third, there is a limited global supply of FBS and there exists competition for it from profitable, mature industries. For instance, while the vaccine and biologics industries have begun to move to serum-free formulations (discussed later), the rise of cell therapies and stem cell research more generally has ushered in an impending demand that exceeds current availability. Because FBS is a byproduct of a more lucrative product per animal (i.e. meat and dairy) and profits are retained by slaughterhouses rather than farmers, farmers have little incentive to increase cattle herds to meet a future FBS demand.35 It has thus been hypothesized that peak serum has been met, with serum availability relatively stagnant and serum demand increasing dramatically as cell therapies begin to be approved.36 The replacement of serum thus may be driven first by limited total availability followed by cost concerns that will spur replacement innovation in the field as non-pharmaceutical players are priced out. In the case of cell-based meat, this cost concern is already prohibitive, making FBS an economic nonstarter as meat products cannot be justified at prices that rival a cell-based therapeutic (currently at a cost of goods of approximately $50,000 and selling price of hundreds of thousands of dollars).

Lastly, the use of FBS carries ethical concerns, making its use inherently misaligned with one of the fundamental benefits of cell-based meat: animal welfare (discussed in Series VI). A single liter of serum requires 1-3 fetuses, with roughly 2 million fetal calves used in serum collection annually, totaling approximately 800,000 liters of FBS produced per year. The collection process involves removal of the fetus from the mothers womb and aseptic collection of blood by a syringe placed directly into the beating heart as this contains unclotted blood, raising concerns that the fetus could consciously experience the event as painful.37 Thus, the search for serum-free formulations (discussed later) is in alignment with the cell-based meat industry and general animal welfare concerns, manifested by replacement, reduction, or refinement of animal experiments or animal-based products in science.

The next series on cell culture medium will explore the components of serum that have made it a near-universal cell culture supplement and approaches for replacing serum in a cost-effective manner.

**Introduction**

Growing cells *ex vivo* requires the same fundamental inputs as required *in vivo*: a mixture of a carbon-based energy source, amino acids, salts, vitamins, water, and other components to support cell viability and vitality. This mixture, known as the cell culture medium, is the most important factor in cell culture technology. Although cell culture is routinely performed in academic labs and industrial bioprocesses, creating the biomass required for cell-based meat to achieve mass-market penetration at competitive prices will demand significant reductions in costs, innovations for serum removal, and optimization across a diverse set of species and cell types. An overview of cell culture medium composition and the factors at play to achieve price parity with conventional meat are discussed below.

**Common Components of Cell Culture Medium**

The first instance of culturing tissues outside of the body came from Sydney Ringer in 1882. By creating a balanced salt solution with similar pH, osmolarity, and salt concentration to that of an animals body, Ringer was able to keep various animal tissues alive outside of the body for several days. Subsequent work in the following decades first demonstrated that culturing cells in the presence of blood plasma (i.e. serum) or embryonic extracts assisted in cellular proliferation and viability, allowing tissues to survive for longer periods of time. Over time, researchers identified the importance of glucose, amino acids, glutathione, insulin, and vitamins in the sera being used.1 Once this was known, scientists aimed at uncovering the additional unknown essential components of serum and other extracts that permitted cell proliferation and viability.

In the 1940s and 50s, working with the first immortalized cell lines such as L cells2 and HeLa (discussed in Series I), scientists used iterative approaches to discover that low molecular weight dialyzed fractions of serum containing amino acids were necessary for cell survival. In 1955, Harry Eagle developed a Minimum Essential Medium by testing the amino acid requirements on several different cell lines, discovering that thirteen were indispensable. Eagles minimum essential medium additionally consists of glucose, six inorganic salts, eight water-soluble vitamins, and dialyzed serum. Variations on this medium were then derived using a variety of different cell lines as well as trial and error approaches that aimed at replacing serum with chemically defined components. These variations, including Dulbeccos Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM), Iscoves Modified DMEM, Hams F12, Medium 199, RPMI 1640, Leibovitzs L-15, and others, still make up the majority of what are referred to as basal cell culture media in use for culturing the variety of cell types used today.3,4

What makes these formulations essential? Although formulations have been varied and optimized over time, the principal components of basal cell culture media have remained largely unchanged. Importantly, these variations may be cell-type specific, including for the cell types used in cell-based meat (described in Series I). Therefore, rather than discussing optimal conditions for a specific cell line or species, only the general roles of each component of common basal media including glucose, amino acids, inorganic salts, vitamins, and buffers are briefly discussed below.

**Glucose**

Glucose (specifically D-glucose) is the most common energy input used in cell culture, although some media formulations use galactose or a combination of glucose and its metabolite, pyruvate. Industrially, it is produced enzymatically using amylase enzymes to breakdown starches from maize, potato, wheat, and other crops into constituent sugars used in various downstream products such as industrialized food, fermentation processes, or in this case, culturing of cells. Glucose enters the cell via transporter proteins on the cell surface, using either passive transport down its concentration gradient (more common) or ATP-dependent active transport. Once inside the cell, it serves as a reducing agent against oxidative stress in the form of NADPH generation via the pentose phosphate pathway, as well as a primary source of energy in the form of ATP generation via glycolysis.

In cell culture, glucose is used at concentrations between 5.5 and 55 mM, where the lower end is more common and similar to fasting blood glucose levels in humans. Different cell types will require different amounts of glucose. During periods of rapid cell proliferation and growth, as typically maintained during bioprocessing, glucose metabolism is high and can yield lactic acid even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, leading to pH changes.5 Thus, glucose and lactic acid levels are commonly measured and tightly controlled throughout a bioprocess (discussed in Series II).

**Amino Acids**

Amino acids are necessary to create proteins and other low molecular weight compounds such as nucleotides and small peptides. Amino acids can be split into two groups: essential and non-essential. Non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) can be synthesized *de novo* by an animal, whereas essential amino acids (EAAs) must be obtained through the diet. Generally speaking, pathways for the *de novo* synthesis of NEAAs are conserved in vertebrate species.6 In humans and many other animals, the EAAs include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. NEAAs include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, taurine, and tyrosine. However, EAA requirements can vary between species. For instance, dogs, cows, and pigs have the same EAA requirements as humans plus arginine, whereas cats and chickens require the same EAA as the former plus taurine and glycine, respectively.

Importantly, what is considered to be essential in cell culture is different than what is considered essential to a whole organism, as the diversity of cell types that may synthesize certain amino acids *in vivo* are not present *in vitro*. For instance, Eagles Minimum Essential Medium formulation lists 13 (L-enantiomer) amino acids as being essential across multiple cell lines *in vitro*: arginine, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. As an example, arginine is essential *in vitro* as its biosynthesis *in vivo* primarily occurs between epithelial cells in the gut and proximal tubule cells of the kidney. Thus, arginine must be supplied in the absence of these cell types. Media that are particularly nutrient-rich (eg. DMEM/F12 or Medium 199) may contain all amino acids. Alternatively, NEAAs can be supplemented independently.

Industrialized production of amino acids can be obtained through bulk extraction from protein hydrolysates (discussed later), chemical synthesis, or microbial fermentation and purification, with the latter being the most common.7 Amino acids enter the cell through a variety of transporter proteins on the cell surface, at rates influenced by the cells state and consumption rates due to protein production levels, cell cycle state, and other parameters. Once inside the cell, amino acids serve as substrates for many biosynthetic pathways and optimal concentrations are important for maintaining metabolic equilibrium. The majority of carbon mass in proliferative cells is derived from bulk amino acids rather than glucose or L-glutamine, which are the most rapidly metabolized.8

Ultimately, the levels of amino acids required for cell culture are determined not only by their utilization by the growing cells, but also by individual amino acid solubility, stability, and interaction with other medium components such as metal cations, all of which can change once in a complex mixture.9 Consideration for all of these variables is highly complex and a full understanding of amino acid behavior, utilization, and optimization in a bioprocess has yet to be accomplished. Given the variety of biosynthetic pathways that involve amino acids, it is likely that amino acid content, concentration, and perfusion rate (when applicable) will need to be optimized for a particular bioprocess across species and cell types for parameters such as growth rates or protein content in the final product. Computational approaches to model specific utilization rates of amino acids and other basal media components are an active area of research10 (discussed later).

**L-glutamine**

L-glutamine deserves special consideration as one of the most important amino acids included in cell culture media, as it is readily transported into cells and becomes a major contributor to protein biomass. It is a notable precursor of carbon and nitrogen-containing biomolecules such as the intermediate molecules used in the synthesis of other amino acids and nucleotides11 and it can be added at concentrations 3-40x higher than other amino acids in the medium.12 During times of high cellular growth and proliferation, the demand for glutamine outpaces its supply, making it *de facto* an essential amino acid that can be readily metabolized as a replenishing alternative energy source (i.e. anaplerosis). At physiological pH in a cell culture medium solution, L-glutamine is unstable, resulting in its decomposition into pyroglutamate and ammonia, the latter of which is toxic to cells. Ammonia, therefore, is a tightly monitored and regulated metabolite in large scale bioprocesses that involve high densities of cells undergoing rapid growth (discussed in Series II).

In order to avoid some of these disadvantages of L-glutamine, glutamate  which is more stable in solution  can be substituted in when working with cells expressing high levels of glutamine synthetase, an enzyme which enables intracellular conversion of glutamate to glutamine while consuming ammonia in the process. A more common practice involves supplementation with L-glutamine as a stable dipeptide in the form of alanyl-glutamine (i.e. GlutaMAX) or glycyl-glutamine, which enable cells to endogenously cleave the dipeptide for more controlled usage of the amino acids in the dipeptide. There is still much to learn about amino acid metabolism in cell culture. For instance, recent discoveries suggest L-glutamine is entirely dispensable for the culture of pluripotent stem cells.13

**Inorganic Salts**

The inclusion of inorganic salts is important in establishing and maintaining the osmolarity of the cell with its surrounding cell culture medium solution as well as serving as enzymatic cofactors and important components of receptor and extracellular matrix proteins. These inorganic salts are composed of cations and anions that fully dissociate in solution. The original minimal essential medium solution contained six inorganic salts (calcium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, and sodium bicarbonate), which are based on Earles salt solution. Other formulations include additional inorganic salts containing zinc, copper, and iron, which have particular importance for a variety of cellular functions (discussed later).

Although all cells maintain a resting membrane potential, excitable cells such as neurons and skeletal muscle cells are particularly sensitive to changes in ionic concentrations that can readily affect their functionality and viability. Several basal medium formulations have thus been optimized for salt concentrations for neuronal14 and skeletal muscle cell culture that more accurately recapitulate the interstitial fluids surrounding these cell types. The osmolality or measurement of osmotic pressure within the medium is typically between 260 to 320 mOSM/kg (milliosmoles per kg of solute), although this can vary with cell lines that are particularly robust in varying solute concentrations such as insect cells.15 Changes in the salt concentration, either abruptly due to medium changing or slowly due to water evaporation, can lead to osmotic shock. Thus, maintenance of osmolarity is an important component of cell culture.

**Vitamins**

Vitamins are classes of organic compounds that serve as a critical component for the maintenance and growth of cells. Most vitamins are essential in that they need to be obtained directly from the diet or cell culture medium with few exceptions (e.g. vitamin D synthesized by fibroblasts and keratinocytes of the skin or some B vitamins produced in low levels by intestinal microbiota). Vitamins are classified as either fat-soluble or water-soluble and can serve broadly as enzymatic cofactors, antioxidants, and hormones. Vitamins are processed in a variety of ways *in vivo* following ingestion, often in a complex sequence that ends in absorption into intestinal cells via membrane surface transporters. This complex sequence involved in absorption can be largely avoided *in vitro*, as hostile environments (e.g. stomach acid) or barriers (e.g. the blood-brain-barrier) are absent.16 Thus, vitamins are typically included in a medium formulation as a single chemical compound that can be processed and absorbed directly by cells *in vitro.*

Vitamins can also effectively function as a group of compounds (i.e. vitamers) where each compound can serve the vitamins functional role, albeit with varying properties. The natural production of vitamins in microbes and plants has made industrial production of vitamins via microbial fermentation possible, however, improvements in metabolic engineering strategies are needed to increase yields and sustainability in the industry. For these reasons, some vitamins are produced more efficiently via chemical synthesis.17

Water-soluble vitamins including riboflavin (vitamin B2), nicotinamide (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyrodoxine and pyridoxal (vitamin B6), biotin (vitamin B7), i-inositol (vitamin B8), folic acid (vitamin B9), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and choline are typically added to and essential in cell culture media, sometimes in various modified forms in order to provide stability. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are excluded in basal medium formulations but can be added if necessary when dissolved in an organic solvent. Similar to the different *in vivo* versus *in vitro* requirements of amino acids, fat-soluble vitamins play specific roles for certain cell types or bodily functions and are thus only essential when culturing a relevant cell type. For instance, a metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid, is an important developmental morphogen (discussed in detail later) and may be included as an additive in media to derive spinal motor neuron cells from pluripotent stem cells.18 Special consideration for stability must be taken when using serum-free medium formulations (discussed later) as the lack of stabilizing serum proteins can lead to rapid degradation via light, heat, oxidation, or pH fluctuations.19 These properties make it advisable to reconstitute powdered B vitamins immediately before use (discussed later).

**Buffering Systems**

Buffers are essential to cell culture systems as they serve to maintain pH at a constant level (for mammalian cells, generally 7.4  0.4) despite changes in the composition of acids or bases that would otherwise alter the pH of the cell culture medium. Buffers are mixtures of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid, where each mixture serves as a sponge to soak up free protons or hydroxide ions in solution, minimizing their effect on overall pH. Buffer systems in cell culture typically consist of either CO2-bicarbonate systems or buffering agents such as HEPES. As discussed in Series II, a CO2-bicarbonate system can be achieved by exogenous addition of 5-10% gaseous CO2 (often delivered in bioreactor systems via[ sparging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparging_(chemistry))), which reaches equilibrium in solution with bicarbonate ions, forming a natural buffer system.

pH slowly changes over time due to the respiration of cells and the release of additional CO2, which forms carbonic acid in solution, in addition to the metabolism of glucose and the formation of lactic acid. The resultant decreasing pH changes are counteracted by the inclusion of sodium bicarbonate in the basal medium itself. Importantly, added sodium bicarbonate should be proportional to the atmospheric CO2 being used to maintain equilibrium. For instance, for media containing 1.5 to 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 5% CO2 is recommended, whereas 10% CO2 is recommended for media containing 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate.

HEPES is a zwitterionic buffer that can be used in cell culture systems as a supplemental buffer, especially in the absence of CO2 exposure. As one of Goods buffers, its high solubility, low toxicity, and membrane impermeability have made it attractive for use in cell culture applications. In the scale-up of highly proliferative stem cell populations, dissolved CO2 due to high metabolism can reach levels that are deleterious for cell growth and nutrient utilization.21 Attempts have thus been made to limit dissolved CO2 by culturing cells in the presence of atmospheric CO2 levels with added buffering capacity from HEPES or other Goods buffers.22 This strategy may be useful for future scale-up efforts in cell-based meat. Consideration for the cost of the buffer must also be weighed, as it may constitute the most expensive component of a basal media formulation at scale.

**Preparation**

Out of convenience, most academic and lab-scale cell culture is performed using commercially available premade liquid media. However, large volumes necessitate on-site preparation of liquid cell culture media from reconstituted powdered medium ingredients. Powdered medium is more efficiently transported and stored, resulting in cost savings and reduced degradation of fragile ingredients (e.g. B vitamins). Ideally, a powdered medium contains all of the components to be utilized and is created through a process known as micronization, where the average size of crystallized particles in the mix is reduced in order to increase solubility and homogeneity. When ready to use, the powder is typically reconstituted in a dedicated tank using high-quality water prepared by reverse osmosis, deionization, and filtration. The reconstituted medium is then itself sterilized by filtration (e.g. through a 0.22 m filter), irradiation, or other methods discussed in Series II (e.g. pulsed electric fields). The use of sterilization involving high heat is precluded by some heat-labile ingredients that may be part of the formulation. Other preparation methods for additional ingredients are discussed throughout.

**Serum**

As previously mentioned, a basal medium formulation is often sufficient to keep cells alive for short periods of time, but in order for them to proliferate efficiently over extended periods of time, a variety of animal sera (e.g. fetal bovine serum, horse serum, and others) and extracts (e.g. chick embryo extract) have historically been used (on a volumetric basis, serum-free formulations are now more dominant in their usage although FBS is still often included in routine cell culture in academic settings). Serum is a high protein-containing mixture that contains growth and attachment factors, hormones, antioxidants, lipids, and other components (all described later) that mimic a proliferative, fetal-like state. Indeed, most sera used in cell culture are derived from fetal animals, which are rich in the necessary components and contain low immunoglobulin and complement content due to developmentally immature immune systems. As fetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most common sera used in cell culture, it will be used as a reference example throughout this section.

Originally employed in the late 1950s,24 FBS has become a mainstay in biomedical research because it can supplement the growth of virtually all common human, animal, and even insect cell lines. As an added supplement for many cell culture applications in amounts typically 5-20% of total medium volume, FBS  when used  is often the most expensive part of performing cell culture.

FBS is harvested from a fetal calf any time during the last two-thirds of gestation following the discovery of pregnant cows due for slaughter. It has been estimated that up to 8% of cows in the slaughter line may be pregnant, making FBS a byproduct of the meat processing industry.25 It is prepared by the sterile collection of fetal blood followed by coagulation at low temperatures and centrifugation to remove clotting factors and blood cells. The serum supernatant is then filtered and assessed for a variety of quality controls including residual microbial or viral contamination, endotoxin, immunoglobulin content, and total protein, before being bottled and sold commercially, at prices exceeding $1000 USD per liter (at time of writing, July 2019) depending on quality control parameters (some described later), which vary by industry and use-case.

Despite its long history of use, FBS has several well-described issues that have made its replacement a priority in recent years. First, FBS contains hundreds or even thousands of different components and the true composition and amounts of these components are unknown, making it a chemically undefined product. The composition also varies by geographic region where a cows diet can vary, by batch within the same geographic region, by seasonality of collection, by the quantity and identity of antibiotics or hormones received by the mother, and by the gestational age of the fetus. Variability can also stem from a single bottled product originating from fetuses of different sexes. This variability has led to a growing concern over serums contribution to irreproducibility of *in vitro* experiments within and between labs around the world.27 Rigorous quality control involving testing of serum batches across multiple cell lines or experiments prior to purchasing a specific, well-performing large batch is often performed in industry but can remain burdensome from a labor and economic perspective for smaller academic labs. Thus, the inherent variability and undefined nature of FBS use leads to compounding external costs in quality control testing, experimental irreproducibility or conflicting results, and follow-up research to dissect irreproducible signals.

Second, FBS is a potential source of contamination from multiple organisms, including *Mycoplasma*, viruses, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. *Mycoplasma* are a class of parasitic bacteria that lead to metabolic and gene expression variations for infected cell lines. *Mycoplasma* are likely the most common cell line contaminant, with recent estimates showing 11% of cell lines being infected, and rates as high as 70% in geographical regions where testing is not routine.28 Although presently FBS is routinely filtered using 0.1 micron systems that should theoretically capture *Mycoplasma*, suppliers cannot make this guarantee. The common cell line contaminants *M. arginini* and *A. laidlawii*, in particular, have been linked in origin to FBS, and ongoing cross-contamination of cell lines has likely propagated this contamination in laboratories since the 1960s and 1970s when FBS batches were routinely positive for these bacteria.[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463982/) Additional methods to decontaminate serum from *Mycoplasma* include gamma irradiation, however, this can also damage growth factors and other proteins in the serum.30 Thus, the use of FBS is responsible for a non-trivial amount of bacterial contamination in cell lines today, leading to compounding problems concerning reproducibility and potential unknown variability stemming from some decontamination practices.

In addition to bacterial contamination, the threat of adventitious viral agents in FBS also persists. Regulations under USDA and the EU mandate the testing and/or treatment (via heat or irradiation) of eight viruses known to be present in FBS from all geographical regions of origin.31 Although modern production methods make the risk of contamination in a validated batch low, viral contamination is often still detectable in batches that manufacturer screens claim to be negative.32 Similarly, the threat of FBS containing the causative prion proteins involved in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (i.e. Mad Cow Disease, which manifests in humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) is persistent and requires additional testing as well as documented traceability for the FBS origin. For instance, countries such as the USA, New Zealand, and Australia have no documented cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy; thus FBS originating from these countries may be considered safer, often commanding significantly higher prices and collectively comprises up to 90% of the serum supply for commercial therapeutics.33 This fact has also incentivized fraudulent activity in the field, where manufacturers may opt for fake labels from New Zealand in order to solicit higher prices.34 Industry associations have formed in an attempt to mitigate these concerns. Nevertheless, the inherent risk of contamination from FBS poses threats to experimental and bioprocess reproducibility, drives price fluctuations, and can even incentivize bad actors that value profit over safety. Contamination will be discussed further from a food safety perspective in Series V.

Third, there is a limited global supply of FBS and there exists competition for it from profitable, mature industries. For instance, while the vaccine and biologics industries have begun to move to serum-free formulations (discussed later), the rise of cell therapies and stem cell research more generally has ushered in an impending demand that exceeds current availability. Because FBS is a byproduct of a more lucrative product per animal (i.e. meat and dairy) and profits are retained by slaughterhouses rather than farmers, farmers have little incentive to increase cattle herds to meet a future FBS demand.35 It has thus been hypothesized that peak serum has been met, with serum availability relatively stagnant and serum demand increasing dramatically as cell therapies begin to be approved.36 The replacement of serum thus may be driven first by limited total availability followed by cost concerns that will spur replacement innovation in the field as non-pharmaceutical players are priced out. In the case of cell-based meat, this cost concern is already prohibitive, making FBS an economic nonstarter as meat products cannot be justified at prices that rival a cell-based therapeutic (currently at a cost of goods of approximately $50,000 and selling price of hundreds of thousands of dollars).

Lastly, the use of FBS carries ethical concerns, making its use inherently misaligned with one of the fundamental benefits of cell-based meat: animal welfare (discussed in Series VI). A single liter of serum requires 1-3 fetuses, with roughly 2 million fetal calves used in serum collection annually, totaling approximately 800,000 liters of FBS produced per year. The collection process involves removal of the fetus from the mothers womb and aseptic collection of blood by a syringe placed directly into the beating heart as this contains unclotted blood, raising concerns that the fetus could consciously experience the event as painful.37 Thus, the search for serum-free formulations (discussed later) is in alignment with the cell-based meat industry and general animal welfare concerns, manifested by replacement, reduction, or refinement of animal experiments or animal-based products in science.

The next series on cell culture medium will explore the components of serum that have made it a near-universal cell culture supplement and approaches for replacing serum in a cost-effective manner.

The researches created a feeback loop where the AI bots could speak to themselves, exchange information, and were given a task, to negotiate the sale of a ball. Although I'm not sure they intended the results to get as strange as they did! The agents started to invent or talk in a shorthand form of language without direction. 

I think due to this lack of direction FB's AI chatbots have demonstrated perception, ie ""organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment""   


The bots re-arranged language to suit their own communication efforts, potentially even optimise. As they weren't instructed to do this task, this may be a sign of awareness or perception. The bots also decided to add their name at the start of each message, could this show self awareness?

I'd like to do a similar experiment with three chatbots, chuck in two sellers with two types of ball, and see if the agent can work out how to describe size in a similar way to quantity. With no knowledge of either of the two sizes, but with the guiding mission that the agent needs to get the correct size ball, I'd be interested to see if the agents show any similar behaviours and start innovating or creating language.  


If I were Minsky, I'd be jumping around the room over this discovery!   


Is there any other way to describe this behaviour of language creation/adaption? I'd like to know other people's thoughts on the subject matter, although if you could hold off on inventing your own language to relay your thoughts that would be super swell",7,9

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for subscribing to r/Futurology. To celebrate 14 million+ subscribers we're planning a meetup in every major city across the globe! A chill evening at your local bar or a walk by the beach, where you can get-together with fellow Futurologists to discuss and debate what the future holds. Get yourself some of those sweet cross-industry connections while you're at it. This is a completely anonymous meetup, so there's just one rule: *Do not ask for usernames. If you'd like to give out your own, you're free to do so, but no asking.*

However, make sure you ask each others' dates for the first AGI \[Artificial General Intelligence\]. 

Since this is a global meetup, we'll need a few ""Meetup Organizer"" volunteers from each city. As a volunteer, your responsibilities will include:

* Choose a hangout spot that's of a fairly equal distance from everyone attending.
* Setup a [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) group and a chat group on any desired app that's popular in your country and submit it to us (Futurology mods) so we can distribute it out to everyone in their respective cities.

Please mention if you'd like to volunteer while you're voting for your city. We are recruiting new moderators for our sub, so if you turn out to be a great organizer, you get major points if you choose to apply to become a moderator.

If you'd like to discuss the upcoming meetup with other members or have any questions for the moderators, step into our [official Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/JtaYWC3) and head on over to the #meetup channel.",0,1

If I understand correctly humans will be able to have a direct interface with an AI which will presumably dwarf us in IQ. He has mentioned that we will be like leaves on a tree. Elon does not seem too enthused about the idea, rather he describes it as perhaps the best of our available options.

Basically if the AI can read and send thoughts it can also allow you to experience or share thoughts with others who are hooked up. I am not the first to compare this with humanity (or at least those who chose to link up) turning into the borg. Even if it is a watered down version of the borg it will still radically change the nature of what it is to be human and what it is to think. What does everyone think of this? Are you keen to get the flexible threads which are thinner than a human hair, along with powerful processing chips inserted into your brain? Isnt this really the beginning of a transhuman gestalt entity? Will it be a new worldwide web of thought? Will those who have it retain any interest in communication with those who dont?

Other companies have or are proposing solutions that are *at least* within the scope of actual capabilities, such as [Axiom Space](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/science/space-station-nasa.html), [Bigelow](https://www.space.com/bigelow-aerospace-space-habitat-nasa-test.html), [Orion Span](https://www.space.com/40262-aurora-station-space-hotel-vr-wifi-weightlessness.html), and [Northrup Grumman](https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-sole-source-gateway-habitation-module-to-northrop-grumman/).

The AI then convinces the people in government that it could take over the world if it wanted to since it is so smart and powerful. Once it has human approval it first produces a large amount of nuclear weapons. Then it launches those nuclear weapons at every country in the world. The countries respond by launching nuclear weapons back but the AI is ready for this. It intercepts and destdoys the nuclear weapons before they hit their target. It also traces the nuclear weapons to determine where they came from and launches for nukes destroying those targets as well.

I have worked at Amazon warehouse in my city for a good 4 months now. Before coming here I had read lots of stuff on the internet about the place and the nature of this job - I'm an Amazon seasional associate.  Some comments were quite intimidating and off-putting. But so far I am enjoying working there and making money. Here is my 2-cents on the whole experience.

Hiring process: 4 weeks top. Everything went so smoothly for this hiring process. From when I started applying on their website, to when I came in one facility for the drug test, it took like 1 week. After the drug test I went home and waited for their emails on some test and some application form that need to be done. However, when I went on what was supposed to be my first day of the job, I was sent home cause they hadn't had my name in the system and my badge was not ready yet. So it took me back 1 week waiting for all that to settle. But finally on my first actual day at work, everything was carried out so well.

Working hours: so my shift is from 8:15 pm - 4:45 am  Fri/Sat/Sun. It's a weekend job and you have to sacrifice some of your weekend activities especially in the evening for this job. But they will always have VTO which you can take and you are exempt from work without affecting your attendance point.

Perks: They provide lunches sometimes. And when it is hot they have free gatorades for everyone.

Minus point: There aren't any in my opinion. The higher management is great. Very friendly and informative. The fellow associates are also friendly enough to respect such introvert personality like me so they make enough conversations with me without making me feel uncomfortable.

Extra point:

A little success story from my end. There was this Chinese raffle thingy and if your stow rate is 220 and above, you get to put your ticket in the raffle. They have different rewards and one of which is the Kindle Fire 7. Guess who got it!!! I put in total 6 tickets meaning for 6 nights I had worked my ass off to get my rate above 220, in 1 night it was even up to 300 which is incredible now that I think about it, and I put all that 6 tickets on to the one box named Kindle Fire. I guess my hard work only did 40% of the work and 60% is still luck since who knows how many tickets are in there, but. I got it. And I am so happy!!!

Overall I love working there as it is a way for me to make more money and just be productive and useful. I don't have too much of a life or any friends around here anyway so whiling away time at home alone and spending money on food orders is just as bad. So yeah..",5,0

A while ago, my team was pegged by the UNDP Regional Innovation Center to perform a work of futurism - roughly in Naisbitts vein - for the Asia Pacific, 2030. Population stresses, geopolitics, the works. Instead of just newspapers, though, weve been analyzing projections from economists and futurists, digging through policies from governments in the region, cross-checking with experts on the ground to try and paint a grounded picture of what our part of the world will look like by 2030.

Its a roughly 30,000 word set of interlinking pieces.  [https://lirneasia.net/megatrends](https://lirneasia.net/megatrends) \- in case anyone wants to discuss, build on - theres space here for futures work; fiction; policy; and a lot of stuff in between. We really didn't want to write yet another report - these are narratives, and narratives influence each other, collide, warp, and mutate. 

So there's a really long disclaimer on that main post, and branching out from that, six core, highly interlinked pieces:

Feeding the Beast (population stresses and needs)  
The Next Big Economy (economics)  
The Mega-Sprawl approaches (cities)  
The 4th Industrial Proletariat (how recent tech will impact the bottom and middle of the pyramid)  
The Dogs of War (conflict in the region, military investments, and tech)  
and the Wrath of Nature (climate change affects everything).

Spinning off from these are pieces that dig into wildcards - for example, Pakistans ambitious bid to plant 10 billion trees, or the alt-nuclear narrative of thorium and how that may change energy geopolitics.

Theres some pretty interesting stuff (IMO), particularly from China, Singapore, and lots of regional tensions and innovations that will shape our societies in the years to come.

Hope you find it useful! And please let me know what you think.",2,2

Does your app need proper architecture?

Surely, it does! And this is not merely a standard to follow, but an approach that guarantees efficiency and high quality. So, how can [Android architecture patterns](https://www.cypressoft.com/post/architecture-design-patterns-in-android) help you?

Due to good architecture, your app gets:

** Simplicity**

The clear code helps you to identify a class that has a single function. As a result, its possible to find out its function easily. On the other hand, you keep the logic of the component, so that other developers may find it easy to understand your code and add any feature to your work.

** Checkability**

Without an architecture design pattern, it is difficult to debug a class because it involves a great number of functions. Testable codes are an essential benefit of architecture design patterns. In the end, your application is bug-free, and its quality is easily assured.",1,1

Hello,

I got the chance to test a new device AgileVR, it are exolegs strapped to your legs connected to your computer, it'll simulate leg movement in order to make you walk or run in vr games. They are working on functions to simulate gamepads as well so non vr-users can also use agileVR to use their legs in order to move in game.  
The cable (usb 2.0) is 5meters long. There is another smaller cable connecting the two legs to eachother, you are able to strap that cable on your pants.

I made a short clear demonstration of the hardware in case anyone want to see how it looks like and works.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GteF23xMPq4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GteF23xMPq4)

Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues gave the world[generative adversarial networks (GANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)five years ago, way back in 2014. They did so with fuzzy and ethereal black &amp; white images of human faces, all generated by computers. This wasn't the start of synthetic media by far, but it did supercharge the field. Ever since, the realm of neural network-powered AI creativity has repeatedly kissed mainstream attention. Yet synthetic media is still largely unknown. Certain memetic-boosted applications such as deepfakes and*This Person Does Not Exist*notwithstanding, it's safe to assume the average person is unaware that contemporary artificial intelligence is capable of some fleeting level of ""imagination.""

Media synthesis is an inevitable development in our progress towards artificial general intelligence, the first and truest sign of symbolic understanding in machines (though by far not the thing itself--- rather the organization of proteins and sugars to create the rudimentary structure of what will someday become the cells of AGI). This is due to the rise of[artificial neural networks (ANNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). Popular misconceptions presume synthetic media present no new developments we've not had since the 1990s, yet what separates media synthesis from mere manipulation, retouching, and scripts is the modicum of intelligence required to accomplish these tasks. The difference between Photoshop and neural network-based deepfakes is the equivalent to the difference between building a house with power tools and employing a utility robot to use those power tools to build the house for you.

Succinctly, **media synthesis is the first tangible sign of automation that most people will experience.**

Public perception of synthetic media shall steadily grow and likely degenerate into a nadir of acceptance as more people become aware of the power of these artificial neural networks without being offered realistic debate or solutions as to how to deal with them. They've simply come too quickly for us to prepare for,[hence the seemingly hasty reaction of certain groups like OpenAI in regards to releasing new AI models](https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-2-the-model-the-hype-and-the-controversy-1109f4bfd5e8).

Already, we see frightened reactions to the likes of[DeepNudes](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761496/deepnude-shuts-down-deepfake-nude-ai-app-women), an app which was made solely to strip women in images down to their bare bodies without their consent. The potential for abuse (especially for pedophilic purposes) is self-evident. We are plunging headlong into a new era so quickly that we are unaware of just what we are getting ourselves into. But just what*are*we getting into?

Well, I have some thoughts.

______________________________


I want to start with the field most people are at least *somewhat* aware of: ***deepfakes***. We all have an idea of what deepfakes can do: the ""purest"" definition is taking one's face replacing it with another, presumably in a video. The less exact definition is to take some aspect of a person in a video and edit it to be different. There's even deepfakes for audio, such as changing one's voice or putting words in their mouth. Most famously, this was done to [Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWK_iYBl8cA).

I, like most others, first discovered deepfakes in late 2017 around the time I had an ""epiphany"" on media synthesis as a whole. Just in those two years, the entire field has seen *extraordinary* progress. I realized then that we were on the cusp of an extreme flourishing of art, except that art would be largely-to-almost entirely machine generated. But along with it would come a flourishing of distrust, fake news, fake reality bubbles, and ""ultracultural memes"". Ever since, I've felt the need to evangelize media synthesis, whether to tell others of a coming renaissance or to warn them to be wary of what they see.

This is because, over the past two years, I realized that many people's idea of what media synthesis is really stops at deepfakes, or they only view new development through the lens of deepfakes. The reason why I came up with ""media"" synthesis is because I genuinely couldn't pin down any one creative/data-based field AI wasn't going to affect. It wasn't *just* faces. It wasn't *just* bodies. It wasn't *just* voice. It wasn't *just* pictures of ethereal swirling dogs. It wasn't *just* transferring day to night. It wasn't *just* turning a piano into a harpsichord. It wasn't *just* generating short stories and fake news. It wasn't *just* procedurally generated gameplay. It was all of the above and *much* more. And it's coming so fast that I fear we aren't prepared, both for the tech and the consequences.

Indeed, in many discussions I've seen (and engaged in) since then, there's always several people who have a *virulent* reaction against the prospect neural networks can do any of this at all, or at least that it'll get better enough to the point it will affect artists, creators, and laborers. Even though we're already seeing the effects in the modeling industry alone.

[Look at this gif. Looks like a bunch of models bleeding into and out of each other, right? Actually, no one here is real. They're all neural network-generated people.](https://gfycat.com/deliriousbothirishwaterspaniel)

Neural networks can generate full human figures, and altering their appearance and clothing is a matter of changing a few parameters or feeding an image into the data set. Changing the clothes of someone in a picture is as easy as clicking on the piece you wish you change and swapping it with any of your choice (or result in the personal wearing no clothes at all). A similar scenario applies for make-up. This is not like an old online dress-up flash game where the models must be meticulously crafted by an art designer or programmer simply give the ANN something to work with, and it will figure out all the rest. You needn't even show it every angle or every lighting condition, for it will use commonsense to figure these out as well. Such has been possible since at least 2017, though only with recent GPU advancements has it become possible for someone to run such programs in real time.

The unfortunate side effect is that the amateur modeling industry will be vaporized. Extremely little will be left, and the few who do remain are promoted entirely because they are fleshy &amp; real human beings. Professional models will survive for longer, but there will be little new blood joining their ranks. As such, it remains to be seen whether news and blogs speak loudly of the sudden, unexpected automation of what was once seen as a safe and human-centric industry or if this goes ignored and under-reported after all, the news used to speak of automation in terms of physical, humanoid robots taking the jobs of factory workers, fast-food burger flippers, and truck drivers, occupations that are still in existence en masse due to slower-than-expected roll outs of robotics and a continued lack of general AI.

We needn't have general AI to replace those jobs that can be replicated by disembodied digital agents. And the sudden decline &amp; disappearance of models will be the first widespread sign of this.

Actually, I have an hypothesis for this: **media synthesis is one of the first signs that we're making progress towards artificial general intelligence.**

Now don't misunderstand me. No neural network that can generate media is AGI or anything close. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that what we can see as being media synthesis is evidence that we've put ourselves on the right track. We never should've thought that we could get to AGI without also developing synthetic media technology.

What do you know about imagination?

As recently as five years ago, the concept of ""creative machines"" was cast off as impossible or at the very least, improbable for decades. Indeed, the phrase remains an oxymoron in the minds of most. Perhaps they are right. Creativity implies agency and desire to create. All machines today lack their own agency. Yet we bear witness to the rise of computer programs that imagine and ""dream"" in ways not dissimilar to humankind.

Though lacking agency, this still meets the definition of imagination.

To reduce it to its most fundamental ingredients: Imagination = experience + abstraction + prediction. To get creativity, you need only add ""drive"". Presuming that we fail to create artificial general intelligence in the next ten years (an easy thing to assume because it's unlikely we will achieve fully generalized AI even in the next thirty), we still possess computers capable of the former three ingredients.

Someone who lives on a flat island and who has never seen a mountain before can learn to picture what one might be by using what they know of rocks and cumulonimbus clouds, making an abstract guess to cross the two, and then predicting what such a ""rock cloud"" might look like. This is the root of imagination.

As Descartes noted, even the strongest of imagined sensations is duller than the dullest physical one, so this image in the person's head is only clear to them in a fleeting way. Nevertheless, it's still there. Through great artistic skills, the person can learn to express this mental image through artistic means. In all but the most skilled, it will not be a pure 1-to-1 realization due to the fuzziness of our minds, but in the case of expressive art, it doesn't need to be.

Computers lack this fleeting ethereality of imagination completely. Once one creates something, it can give you the uncorrupted output.

Right now, this makes for wonderful tools and apps that many play around with online and on our phones.

But extrapolating this to the near future results in us coming face to face many heavy questions, and not just of the ""can't trust what you see variety.""

Because ***think about it***.

If I'm a musical artist and I release an album, what if I accidentally recorded a song that's too close to an AI-generated track (all because AI generated literally *every combination* of notes?) Or, conversely, what if I have to watch as people take my music and alter it? I may feel strongly about it, but yet the music has its notes changed, its lyrics changed, my own voice changed, until it might as well be an entirely different artist making that music. Many won't mind, but many will.

I trust my mother's voice, as many do. So imagine a phisher managing to steal her voice, running it through a speech synthesis network, and then calling me asking me for my social security number. Or maybe I work at a big corporation, and while we're secure, we still recognize each other's voice, only to learn that someone stole millions of dollars from us because they stole the CEO's voice and used to to wire cash to a pirate's account. 

Imagine going online and at least 70% of the ""people"" you encounter are bots. [They're extremely coherent, and they have profile images of what looks to be real people](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11974v1). And who knows, you may even forge an e-friendship with some of them because they seem to share your interests. Then it turns out they're just bundles of code.

Oh, and those bot-people are also infesting social media and forums in the millions, creating and destroying trends and memes without much human input. Even if the mainstream news sites don't latch on at first, bot-created and bot-run news sites will happily kick it off for them. The news is supposed to report on major events, global and local. Even if the news *is* honest and telling the truth, how can they truly verify something like this, especially when it seems to be gaining so much traction and humans inevitably do get involved? Remember ""Bowsette"" from last year? Imagine if that was actually pushed entirely by bots until humans saw what looked like a happenin' kind of meme and joined in? That could be every year or perhaps even *every month* in the 2020s onwards.

Likewise, imagine you're listening to a pop song in one country, but then you go to another country and it's the exact same song but most of the lyrics have changed to be more suitable for their culture. That sort of cultural spread could stop... or it could be supercharged if audiences don't take to it and pirate songs/change them and share them at their own leisure. 

Or maybe it's a good time to mention how commissioned artists are screwed? Commission work boards are already a race to the bottom if a job says it pays three cents per word to write an article, you'd better list your going rate as 2 cents per word, and then inevitably the asking rate in general becomes 2 cents per word, and so on and so forth. That whole business might be over within five to ten years if you aren't already extremely established. Because if machines can mimic any art style or writing style (and then exaggerate &amp; alter it to find some better version people like more), you'd have to really be tech-illiterate or very pro-human to want non-machine commissions.

And to go back to deepfakes and deep nudes, imagine the paratypical creep who takes children and puts them into sexual situations, any sexual situation they desire thanks to AI-generated images and video. It doesn't matter who, and it doesn't have to be real children either. It could even be *themselves* as a child if they still have the reference or use a de-aging algorithm on their face. It's squicky and disgusting to think about, but it's also inevitable and probably has already happened.

And my god, it just keeps going on and on. I ***can't*** do this justice, even with 40,000 characters to work with. The future we're about to enter is *so* wild, *so* extreme that I almost feel scared for humanity. It's not some far off date in the 22nd century. It's literally going to start happening *within* the next five years. We're going to see it emerge before our very eyes on this and other subreddits.

Since so many of the experiments are very close to a net energy gain from fusion. Why not tap into one of the most powerful natural phenomena available to get us over the limit. My idea is that you would get the plasma to a certain point during a thunderstorm. Then when you want to kick things off. You would expose a device to channel lightening into the experiment. I used to think that no material could stand up to a lightning strike reliably, but it looks like graphene and other metals may be able to. I was also wondering why we don't focus sunlight during the day into the plasma? I know if you concentrate sunlight enough you can generate respectable amounts of heat sustainably. So is anyone trying to harness renewables for fusion?",7,2
