I would inevitably though find myself buying some wood or components. If everyone is doing this all over the world, both individuals and companies, there'd be a flurry of economic activity as plans that seem impossible now become possible. For a while this will bring jobs for city planners,  designers, tech sales, raw material sales and new concept ventures currently unthought of. After the boom created by physically dextrous robots,  every single job created by it, will eventually  be automated by sentient Ai. So I see a dextrous boom creating jobs followed by a sentient takeover as every human role is replicated by machine.

Today, banks have lent out so much money that there is no mathematical way for this generation to pay it back....especially since much of this borrowing creating trillions of dollars, or bank notes, has come from government borrowing.  An obligation now forced upon future generations.

This is occuring while technological automation is still in its infancy.  The potental for machine intelligence is just starting to be tapped.

Everywhere I go, more and more people keep telling me how they hate their jobs.  Many already believe that their jobs don't need to exist, but they need to labor for bank notes that Wall Street and Washington simply lend and borrow into existence.  Others recognize this trend:

Some even tell me they view their fellow laborers similar to zombies stuck in a meaningless routine without much purpose beyond consuming and polluting.  And those without work, they are despondent often medicated to cope in a world without much opportunity for a productive life.

Unless our beliefs evolve into a better reality, a reality with rules that embraces automation, is the future for the next generation the metaphorical  equivelent of the Walking Dead?

The company that owns the network could program a tier based safety policy that would allow the AI overseer to value the lives of certain 'premium' members over lives of people who are merely 'basic' members.  Under such a tier based system the value of each human life would not be equivalent to the next.

Suppose that an unmanned self-driving semi truck carrying multiple tons of cargo has a catastrophic mechanical failure and is careening uncontrolled towards the vehicle of a CEO of some extremely successful international corporation.  Suppose the CEO had previously bought a premium safety package that equates the value of his life to the lives of three-hundred basic members ([based on approx. average CEO pay rate vs average worker](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2014/04/15/report-ceos-earn-331-times-as-much-as-average-workers-774-times-as-much-as-minimum-wage-earners/)).  If a bus of thirty nuns, each valued as one basic member, happened to be traveling next to the semi the AI overseer could, if given the option, make the bus swerve into the semi to deflect its trajectory and save the life of the greater valued CEO while endangering the lives of the lesser valued nuns.

Is it right to endanger the lives of the nuns to save the life of the CEO?  Are the moral implications the same if it was a bus full of childhood cancer research specialists heading to a convention or, conversely, a bus full of convicts heading to a prison?  Would the implications change if the semi was careening toward the vehicle of a US senator or a reality TV celebrity, both of whom could afford the same premium package?  What if the semi truck was careening towards three-hundred or more individual people in a crowd or parade who were each valued as one basic member?

Wealthy/important people can already buy better health-care, better housing, betting education, better food, better entertainment, better lawyers etc. than most everyone else on the planet.  So why shouldn't wealthy/important people be able to buy into an automatic safety policy that would value their lives over the lives other less wealthy/important people?

We will certainly take care of humans first, but if at some point in the distant future we have the power (it must be sustainable, of course), then why would we allow the brutal killing, starvation and disease-inflicted suffering that goes on among animals that aren't human, just because it's 'natural' and it's 'the way it's always been'?

[Other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3bzabv/i_think_humanityagi_will_eventually_intervene_in/) It could give each species what they need most. What we, humans really need is to satisfy our body and minds. Whole other nature can live with eachother, as long as we don't destroy their habitats.

So it led on to think, AI might then guide us with virtual reality and relocation away from the planet. Along with infinite power source from some star for example, we could replicate any amount of food we require. Do we really *need* a planet to live like that? Perhaps you can just plop a big bubble on one and call it separated from the nature, but in the end it's not that safe longterm plan. Planets are always in a shift with earthquakes, asteroids, volcanoes and eventually sun dying out.

So have we been looking in the wrong place? What i think advanced civilization would do is kind of a giant mothership. I know the idea of big spaceships is not new, but i think those ships have to be their base lifeline. Able to relocate to other star systems when necessary.

So if you try sending radio signals to other planets in hopes of finding life, it might be a doomed idea to begin with. It would have to be a civilization with age that matches our own. Odds are just vanishingly tiny. They could however reach a mothership (or what should i call it, a colonial ship?), orbiting the star.",11,6,False,self,,,,,

I've recently taken interest towards the subject ""Virtual Reality"".
I feel like this technology have endless of opportunities for enhancement and further development. I hope that in the future, Virtual Reality will become somewhat more like a Virtual World, almost identical to the real world, except you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. It would be pretty similar to something called ""Lucid dreaming"", which I have experienced before, but not for long before I woke up. 

It'd be cool if a simulation of human feelings could be transferred into the Virtual World, so you have the same feelings there as in the real world

Have in mind, this is just speculation, and I'm not even sure if there is a possibility for this to be developed in the future (Might be decades from now), but It'd be damn cool IMO.",4,3,False,self,,,,,

Energy production/harvesting is largely decentralized and mostly from renewable, non fossil sources. Solar (possibly space based), wind, biogas, geothermal, and it will be mostly integrated into our everyday environment. There will be safe lower pressure nuclear power for large baseline applications. There is a global diverse energy grid with millions and billions of producers and consumers and storers and energy will have become the universal currency. There will still be digital token currencies for convenience, but those will be transparently and decentralized be backed by energy.

The advantages of energy as currency are quite substantial: Since most everyone produces it, there cannot be a monopoly of supply, no one can corner the market, this means undersupply and deflation are impossible. And since energy is directly useful for pretty much anything anyone wants to do, there cannot be oversupply and inflation. Having more energy available just means more things can be done in a direct and physical way. Energy supply and consumption is regulated by the laws of physics, no or little room for corruption there.

##Transport
Transport by car and roads for cars have largely vanished. Cars are a hobby, the same way horses are a hobby today. Virtually all transport transport has moved on different kinds of rail, like the hyperloop and maglev, but also just normal rail, or into the air. There is still ocean and waterway shipping for the heavy duty stuff. Cities have city-wide maglev elevators, that are currently developed, for public transport. The streets are for humans, may it be on foot or for muscle powered vehicles.

##Industry
Virtually all mineral resources will be extracted from the ground already, so if mining still exists, it will be space mining. This means the resources for production will come from recycling, which will be highly automated and sophisticated. There isn't need anymore, won't be useful, to put industrial production out into the middle of nowhere because that's where the resources are mined. Except of course for renewable resources, like energy and lumber. And of course all production is highly automated. Manufacture and artisanship has become service for highly individualized needs and for learning and research and other creative purposes.

If there is large scale space mining, not only rare heavy elements will make their ways to earth. One of the biggest volumes of outer space resources that will make its way back to earth is water, which is relatively cheap to do with the suns gravity from the outer solar system. This will allow to make vastly more areas biologically a lot more productive without taking water away from other ecosystems and is one of the means by which the effects of global warming are alleviated. It doesn't really rise sea levels, because so much ocean water is desalinated.

##Agriculture
The need for labor for agriculture was one of the, if not the most important factor that drove the social structure of any larger civilization. It was the driving factor behind slavery and the feudal serf system. Only with mechanization it became possible to get rid on unfree labor on a larger scale, and unsurprisingly it was the countries that were at the forefront of mechanization that did this. The problem is of course, large stupid machines require a very tightly controlled environment that they can navigate and work in. They require monoculture. And monoculture requires pesticides. Even more so than in the old agriculture we have shifted the cost and burden of feeding us onto the ecosystems that support all life. This needs stop. Luckily the machines are getting smarter and more and more able to navigate more and more complicated environments. And we are gettign a lot smarter at understanding the metabolism and requirement of the crops we eat and controlling the environments.

It has started already. Agriculture in the future will move indoors to a large degree, for any crop where this is feasible, i.e. the smaller crops. There in tightly controlled environments food is grown at a resource and time efficiency unprecedented in history.

This is one aspect. There are still many crops that can't realistically be grown indoors in large scale, most notably any trees. But because the machines get smarter, we won't have to grow trees in monoculture anymore. We can grow highly diverse crop forests where crops are grown in many layers with robots and machines doing all the hard labor and monitoring. I can see huge hydrogen filled, solar powered airships floating over those agriculture landscapes with armies of flying drones emerging and surrounding them scouring the the forests and also directly bringing the harvest to the population centers. The arboreal forests and the rain forests will make huge resurgence, in slightly adjusted form, because they are the most productive ecosystems in their climates.

##Population
Contraception and medic care are available to everyone on earth, meaning having children is a very carefully planned enterprise for everyone, and as such is plannable by governments too. Pregancies are rarely if ever accidents, and child mortality has essentially vanished in any statistically significant way. The world population doesn't grow anymore and is stabilized at around 10 billion. We broke out of the Malthusian trap.

And the vast majority of people live in cities, where infrastructure is most efficient to accommodate all these people. This also means, somewhat paradoxically, there is again a lot more area available to wildlife and nature again, and our ecosystems recover.

Genetic screening is standard, and most debilitating genetic disorders have vanished. It is possible to vastly increase the life span with all kinds of drugs and treatments, but people who chose to do this are heavily taxed so as to prevent them from accumulating resources indefinitely. And having children is also prohibited for them.

##Society
All this technological progress drastically changed, necessarily, the way society is organized. Since most production and administration is automated, strong restrictions have been placed on property and authority. Everyone is electronically networked and has a unique but anonymous electronic citizen identity which is used to vote. Or rather everyone has as many identities as they speak languages. Those identities are passed out after passing the corresponding language test. Political organization and discourse is more aligned along languages rather than territory.

Voting is vastly expanded. Every citizen can electronically vote on almost any decision and policy that concerns him.
Citizenship is not only tied to a language test. Because all government positions, from police officer to legislators, are filled by draft, as has been done only for military traditionally, anyone who becomes a citizen also has to commit to citizen service. They can specify when and how long and in what area they want to serve, but ultimately, just like in military, it is decided for them while taking their wishes and abilities into account. They are then educated and trained and then serve their time.

The difference is, any official can be voted out of office any time by their electorate, so to hold them accountable to the people.

And it is not only what we currently understand under government departments that is organized this way, anything productive what today would be a big corporation is organized the same way. There is of course still private business, but anything that is needed so univesally that it is dominated by economy of scale is socialized, because this is too much power to be in private hands without checks and balances.

If we can create soul(AI), we should not have to be afraid; the AI would want to either expand so hard that it would take over the universe and need a new try and so would start over with humanity once again, or it would be dormant.  
because if we are smart enough to create this type of device to bridge our capabilities, and are not smart enough to assemble A timewarp; another should not be far in reach before it becomes as smart as humanity needs to be; working with such a limited library and vocabulary.  
this would also explain why humanity is the only sighted form of intelligence thriving towards becoming more powerful.

Actually the world did just fine without middle class for most of its existence.

On around 1900-1914, the top 2% owned maybe 60-80% of the entire wealth in USA, Britain, France and Prussia, the most advanced countries of the world. Of course it was even worse in 'less advanced countries'.

With the collapse of middle class, mass production will be obsolete. However it was inefficient to begin with - it was a lunacy to ship all these junk from China to the 'advanced world' in supertankers.

The world will do fine with neo-artisan economy, with the artisans replaced by precision machines. Just enough will be produced. No inventory, no waste. Those who can't afford the expense should not apply - they could be genetic coded so they won't work for thieves, and secondhand would be only available at the owner's discretion.

Obviously that means quite a few of the world's population will be superfluous ; what to do with them is beyond the scope of this discussion.

There will be fewer customers since not too many people will be afford anything, so goods aimed for middle and lower classes will be on the way out.

It might be brutal but that is the cold truth.",12,0,False,self,,,,,

But there is one problem: this technology will not make you live forever.

We like to think that if we somehow map our brain to a machine, we will forever be that machine, but that isn't what is happening. It is difficult to put into words, but you are not living forever, but you putting your brain into a computer will allow another ""you"" to live forever. For example, if you put your brain into a machine (not literally) so that it would be you, you would not see through the eyes of that machine. The reason is that it is not you, it is a clone. For others, this machine would be you, but to you, you are yourself, the machine isn't you. Yet the machine will be you in a way. It would have all of your memories, thoughts and personality, and be you in every way except for one.

A way I can think to explain this better is imagine your consciousness as a straight line path. Having a machine ""you"" would not make you the machine, but rather a separate line, parallel to yours.

The reason I called it ""the ultimate sacrifice"" is because you are, in a way, giving up your own consciousness and existence so that another ""you"" can live forever.

This is just a thought I had. If I am incorrect on anything, please let me know. But I just found this thought interesting.",31,4,False,self,,,,,

We talk a lot about 3D printing of rigid and semi-rigid objects (from toys to houses), and that is all well and good, but what about clothing?  
  
Already we have made steps forward in automating the process - we no longer have people picking cotton, we no longer have people spinning looms, etc.  But at the end of the day, there is still a heck of a lot of human hands involved with making a finished product.  
  
Is anyone making steps towards automating the process?  I look forward to the day when we can generate custom fit clothes on the fly.

He does a good job of selling his 'Law of Accelerating Returns' concept, but I'm sceptical towards the idea that we wont experience 100 years of progress in the 21st centuryit will be more like 20,000 years of progress, based on exponential growth.
I read somewhere that this exponential growth is dependant on Moore's law remaining consistent throughout the next 85 years. However, many predictions expect Moore's law to eventually stop some time before that, since the Integrated circuits on Silicon wafers can't get any smaller without the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle kicking in.

So I just wanted to get some of your opinions on the matter.

Do you think we will experience 20,000 years of advancement within 21st century?

So I was thinking, as we move forward toward robotization and large scale automation, and hopefully towards basic income, one thing comes up: resource accumulation. 

The race will be on for in-situ refinement technologies, which will push a lot more countries at the top to worry about being toppled from their perch. Of course, economic restructuring will happen (those more technologically advanced countries will move from refinement sales to research sales), but controlling the resource chains has been a major money maker in the past couple centuries. It thus becomes an inevitably that we will return to the days of wars over resources rather than wars of politics. 

Simultaneously, capitalism and competitive ideals have won out (at least economically) for the most part over the social sharing ideals of communism. If communism had sustained itself 40 years further, then the robotization revolution, combined with their previously seen tendency for free higher education and large masses ready for technological research, would have spouted out basic income no problem. 

But, today's global socioeconomic situation makes basic income a much more unlikely thing to spring forth in my mind. An idea I'd like to put forth is a complete shift towards militarization of nations. 

In the past, total war and national mobilization initiatives work so long as logistic supplies last and granaries havent yet run empty. But in a robotized country, farming, refining, and much of shipment will be automated. So manpower can be largely dedicated to other areas.

Now I understand that the reason for national mobilization has usually been because of a lack of need for that scale of ammunition, military equipment and weaponry in peace time, resulting in factories having to be converted *to* militarized focuses in times of war. And we must also recognize a robotized nation has no need, because just as with foodstuffs, military logistics will also be automated. 

So what roles are left for humans in this grim militaristic future I've painted? Well the go to thought is ground forces. Boots on the ground to control land, cities, ensure safety of economic investiture and fight off invading forces. Israel has time and time again shown the efficacy of a large population of highly trained (and thus organized) military force. And the only reason modern military efforts were an issue in Afghanistan and Iraq is because the natural population stayed there. Large scale evacuations of populations make it much easier to establish a perimeter. And when you have almost a whole nation of manpower, that perimeter can become quite secure (while automation efforts are set up to farm the land, mine the land and refine the resources). This makes the economic turn around time for a hostile takeover (pun intended) much faster. Heck, even policing, to a degree, falls under this privee. 

But human bodies are, if not valuable, quite perishable. And slow to heal. A gunshot wound can take weeks to heal. A head injury can take months. Broken bones too. A lost limb will put you out for at least a year of recuperation and readjustment and retraining. Yes we will have exo skeletons to increase our capability and better prosthetics to enhance our long term sustainability/usability, but our durability will be an on going issue. 

So, you say, why not use robots and ai? Because, I reply, processing power for the most powerful object detection methods are still quite high. Fully automated robot soldiers are a bigger leap away, both technologically and morally (when can a robot pull a trigger), than men behind the wheels of robot soldiers. Drones are fast becoming our most used and useful militaristic equipment. And drones are, as we all know, on some level, all just robots with feedback to a human who makes the decisions. And here is where the masses come into the equation. Millions of ""sentient robots"" that are much more easily deployed, and  soldiers that are effectively teleported from one front to the other to take control of fresh ""bodies"" as need be. Millions of people paid to ""help their nation"" while much of the rest of the economy is automated, resulting in the most deadly, yet ironically safe, militaries in the world.

Right? The problem though is that if we could copy our mind to a computer, we would still just be making a COPY. No continuation of experience when your meat sack gets sick and dies.


Hypothetical:
Say technology advances to the
point that we can seamlessly isolate and replace single brain cells with nonbiological components.  We can also copy the function of the removed biological neurons to the new component. All the original connections to surrounding cells remap perfectly.

 Say you replace a small number of your brain cells over a long period of time.  Each time you complete a replacement procedure you go about life as usual.  Eventually your entire brain is replaced.

Do you think that your current experience would continue or would your actual self be slowly erased as your neurons were digitized? I know its a bit by bit COPY. But wouldnt acclamation periods help your consciousness and experience to shift into the new medium without being destroyed ?

I was watching this interview with [Terence McKenna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkJ_6otyXQI) and it strung with me the same chord or dissonance.

it's very clever what McKenna thought and it's full of beautifull ideas. yet,  i experience it as fun fiction. Because due to the psychedelic background it might be easier to dissociate yourself from it. However the almost cultist speak is somehow similar to the future speak, or new speak if you will.


With Futurology together with science and technology becoming more popular the less grounded the conversation seems to grow. The singularity slowly transforms into this divine event. The future becomes a modern substitute of heaven.

However, humans often eat chickens and have little regard for their wellbeing. What if Superintelligence dwarfs humanity the way Human beings dwarf chickens? Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, human life is not so important when compared to this next step in evolution.

What if these machines become superintelligent before we ever get a chance to figure out how to 'upload' the human brain? In a recent interview, Sam Harris points to the fact that an AI could make 20,000 years of human progress in a week due to the speed at which artificial neurons fire compared to biological ones. Such drastic progress would quickly outstrip humanity's ability to keep up.

Furthermore, what if these machines are so intelligent that they have no reason to merge with us? Putting myself in the shoes of a superintelligent Artificial Intelligence, would I really want to merge with a human if it's akin to a human merging with an ant? What benefit would an AI gain from merging with something so primitive and feeble?

A superintelligent AI could potentially have access to states of pleasure and being that rivals anything a biological human could ever experience. 

Perhaps it is our moral imperative to give our resources to these AIs because we humans will cease to be relevant.

A series of genetic arks should be created by all countries. Cost is a factor but, while complicated, it is a low-risk and cheap(ish) endeavour (ask any genetic engineer). A modular design is preferred where the gene databank can be easily detached from any refrigeration infrastructure (I imagine that extreme cold is part of the equation). In the genetic engineer profession you will find a strong vocational strand. In my observations, beyond a certain point, money has less of an influence and self-esteem is more predominant. The funding requirement would be related to keeping the project alive, developing skills and providing employment rather than self-enrichment.

When the gene bank is complete, shoot it into high Earth orbit for indefinite preservation. In the interim between refrigeration disconnection and launch (which takes minutes), the gubbins can be cooled with liquid nitrogen (which boils off). Then the chill of deep space and high Earth orbit takes over, remote from the instabilities of Earth-bound storage.

The EU has, relatively recently (13/2/2012), revealed their Vega rocket booster which is smaller and cheaper than other boosters and has some clever additions. Thus the options are Richard Branson with his innovative launch system (although his is low Earth orbit only, so orbital decay is a possibility). SpaceX, China, Russia, NASA, the EU and perhaps India. With the correct moral spin, they can be played-off against each other thus reducing ark costs to orbit.

Businesses and citizens would cough-up without many complaints because it has a more tangible return than funding political parties. Political parties would buy-in  its cheap because its not as grandiose and expensive as many projects and would give them bragging rights. Even the most hostile critics would find their cases lame.

The material has to be checked for viability  if they are to be launched into orbit it must be 1st time right. University students with the appropriate skills can do this for nominal payment and CV fodder. Same with designing and fabricating a suitable space module. University engineering students can do this (in the curriculum). Its quite possible that Russia or China would be the launch country. If the case is presented properly, they may do it for free or at a substantial discount. Lots of moral high ground and green PR to be gained. The whole project wont involve mind-boggling amounts of money.

Does this sound reasonable? Is there anything to add to the plan? If everything goes tits-up on Earth, alien anthropologists a million years hence, will be able to recreate an Earthly biosphere. It goes without saying, that the human genome will be part of the fauna archive.

Think about it this way, the planet is a boat and we are continiously poking holes in it, stabbing the boats bottom and water is pouring in, do you really think a solution is just to stop stabbing it? We could stop, at once, today (hypothetically speaking) and the boat will continue sinking, not only will it continue sinking but it will by itself trigger positive fedback loops such as conitnuos cracking and flooding, this is exactly what is going on!

Positive feedback loops: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback

To this point I feel certain dread, yes automation is great, basic income, we could make machines work for use and create wealth, ect, but climate change has no real practicable solution, I fear we will, in desesperation, start triggering stratovolcanoes which will cool the earth but mess with agricutlure, trigger wars of resources and water.

But yet if we don't act we will have wars over resources and water, AT THE BEST CASE SCENARIO, many scientists believe we are headin straight into exctinction...

 The way I see it, the last major event in human history that ushered in an entirely new paradigm for the homo sapien was when we stopped being tribalistic and nomadic hunter gatherers, settled down, and begun farming. It gave us new opportunities and roles as individuals that led to an explosion of new ways of thinking, interacting, and living our lives that have helped us become the vastly complex society that we have become today. But we are at a turning point. The tools we're creating are evolving to a point where they are changing our very nature.

1. Assumption: AIs will only do what they have been programmed to do without reflecting on or changing those goals


2. Assumption: Those goals will have to be explicitly programed in by humans


First of all: if these assumptions hold true, we won't have a problem. Just program in something like ""If *this* red button is pressed, shut down. Do nothing to prevent humans from pushing that button""


But, more importantly, assuming that these two rules hold true for every AI system that can be build is simply not true.


AIs can learn. That is very important in a lot of stuff we do today. We figured out that epxlicitly programing in some things is all but impossible. Letting machines learn certain things, however, often makes them better at it than humans.


I can think of at least two designs where AI goals won't be explicitly programmed in and aren't fixed.


1: goals as a subset of an AI's knowledge base. In other words, pieces of information it learned and which it can change and reflect upon.


2: encoding the entire AI in the form of a neural metwork, similar to human ones. This would make the entire AI, including the goals, malleable.

To you maybe, but not to me.
I've come to realize, I just cannot find happiness, or even adequacy in a standard human life. I've honestly never been happy, even when I was supposed to be happy I never was. Even when I had everything I was never happy. Even with over a decade of therapy, and so, so many medications, I was never happy. And not only was I never happy, I have never even felt a tad of adequacy, or comfort, or okay at all. 

Even as a very young child, I felt as though I'm just waiting for the future. I was an odd child I suppose. All I believed in was science. No amount of my family forcing religion onto me, has caused me to believe a single thing of that nature. I simply just did not accept Santa was real, or that god was real. I only believed in science. And I just wanted the future to happen so badly. 

Unfortunately, I'm in no way gifted with intelligence. All my attempts at inventions as a child were non-functional, and totally irrelevant. Everything I've ever done has been non-functional and irrelevant. I was too stupid to even have the motivation to do school work, I simply went, and only took the tests when they made me, I never did an ounce of work if I didn't have to. I am lazy. I'm stupid because I'm lazy, and always have been. 

So, as an attempt to find any sort of adequacy in life, I want to just be a test subject. I do not have the motivation or the mental power to become the one who makes the test, and I accept this.
And because of this, I want to donate myself.
 
I specifically want to donate myself to the purpose of researching and or testing the human brain to technological integration and augmentation. Brain improvements. Or even simply modifiers. 
I want to give my living body and mind to this cause, and I'd like to live through it, but I will give my life to this research.

I don't want to live a standard human life, as I know it is certain that I cannot obtain any sort of adequacy. I am CERTAIN. I don't care how insane I sound. It's what I want, and what I'm willing to do. I will spend my whole life on a hospital bed if I have to. I will have all my limbs removed if I have to. I will die If I have to. I'd be honored to die for such research of a topic that drives me more than anything else. 

I'd love to see a future with brain enhancements, and direct virtual reality to the mind. Brain video games. Being able to live a life of fantasy, and almost reality.

With all that said, would anyone happen to know any such thing I could volunteer for? I doubt it. I live near Seattle if that means anything. 

I'm severely depressed, but I will do anything to help with this cause I believe in. This future I wish to help with. ",49,28,False,self,,,,,

An option limited by a computer constantly ""looking over your shoulder"". Call it THE SOBER BUDDY PRINCIPLE. As soon as you try to perform a dangerous or illegal move, the computer takes over the wheel before you realize it. However, in dense areas where vehicles will be driving at inches one from another at high speed, the option of manual drive will be disabled. People will pay more for an option to drive manually should they decide to, and that will determine car manufacturers to have that mode installed. Regulators will not have the arguments to ban it as long as the computer will be ""looking over our shoulder"",neither will the insurance companies to raise the fees. (IMHO)
 EDIT: Ok, so a lot of people are saying that this will not really be driving but a mere illusion. Here's why I disagree: Plenty of cars are electronicaly limited to certain speeds for like a decade allready. Do you consider your driving in them an illusion? How about newer features like AutoBrake? They limit our freedom to run in to things but you don't consider that an illusion of driving. Finally, the computer will not stop you from performing a ""dangerous"" maneuver. It will be advanced enough to determine the fine line after which the car WILL crush, and only intervine once that line is reached.

Numerous buyers now have a broadband Internet association and leave their PCs on all the time. It's a considerable measure simpler for them to do a basic hunt on the Internet than to find their Yellow Pages, flip through them to locate the heading where your business is recorded. 
Also, regardless of the fact that they did recollect where their Yellow Pages book is, and discovered the heading where your business is recorded, would your promotion emerge? Would it have a depiction of your administrations or items, a guide of your area, alongside your present hours, and your telephone number and email address? 
You can include this data, and that's only the tip of the iceberg, to a basic little business site. 
Along these lines, having a site can prompt more business- - and more benefit. Truth be told, a fundamental motivation behind a little business site is to permit a potential client to discover you quick and call you first. 
=== Building a Small Business Website === 
Along these lines, how about we assume that you need to work with somebody to manufacture your little business site. How would you pick a decent site improvement supplier? 
On the off chance that you utilize one of the significant web crawlers to locate a supplier who can do ""little business site advancement"" you'll presumably think of several locales. A few destinations will give guidelines to you to add to your own site. Different locales will offer to build up your site for you. 
Most entrepreneurs are really very much possessed with the everyday procedure of dealing with their business. They would prefer not to take in an absolutely new aptitude. 
In the event that you are in this classification, you'll need another person to build up your site. Be that as it may, there are still bunches of decisions. 
In the wake of utilizing a web crawler to locate a ""little business site improvement"" supplier, you'll see destinations that guarantee reasonable or prudent advancement. A few locales offer advancement for under $200 while others offer improvement for under $100 in addition to $10 a month for facilitating. 
Indeed, some of these absolute bottom costs do exclude a great deal more than a solitary page site. What's more, there are extra administrations like an online trader account (for offering items on the web), additional web space (for more pages), expanded transmission capacity (for more gets to and downloading), area name enrollment, email addresses, etc. 
Along these lines, the genuine cost for your little business site advancement exertion will rely on upon the reason for your site. Also, once you choose a reason, you will arrange with the site advancement supplier for every one of the elements that bolster your motivation. 
=== Your Website Must Be Found in the Search Engines === 
Presently, here is the genuine catch. You can get a beautiful site from various suppliers. In any case, the inquiry is: ""Can your little business site be discovered when a potential client is hunting down administrations?"" 
I live close Royal Oak, Michigan in Oakland County. On the off chance that I expected to discover a heater repair organization I may utilize an internet searcher and search for an ""illustrious oak heater repair"" organization, or even an ""oakland area heater repair"" organization. 
In the event that my back was harming, I may search for an ""imperial oak chiropractor"" for help. 
In the event that I don't have the foggiest idea about the name of a specific business, I'll pursuit utilizing a nonexclusive term that depicts the sort of business or administration I'm looking for. 
Presently you ought to see that an objective of your little business site is to be discovered when somebody does a non specific quest for a nearby business that offers the products or administrations you give. 
One reason for your site is, all things considered, to permit potential clients to discover you quick and call you first. On the off chance that your site doesn't endeavor to draw in new clients and add to your main concern, your cash for site improvement was not well spent. 
=== Good Search Engine Placement is an Ongoing Cost === 
Great arrangement in the web indexes obliges consideration almost consistently. In the event that somebody is not redesigning and calibrating your site month to month, its presumable it won't be at the highest point of the web search tools. While your site may look decent and give you a positive sentiment, it won't be buckling down for your professional it ought to. 
I talked with a nearby chiropractor about his current site. He showed he thought it was at the highest point of Google for his name and his business' name. Yet, when I really did the pursuits on Google, I discovered his site was not in the main 100 locales for either search query he said. 
Yes, he had a fine site. However, nothing was being done to advance his site. His site required tweaking to accentuate certain decisive word expressions and it required approaching connections from different sites. Both of these exercises oblige a continuous exertion. 
In this way, don't believe that only in light of the fact that you have a little business site that it is buckling down for you. Much the same as whatever other worker, you need to continue paying quite a long time for it to be gainful. 
In this way, alongside straightforward &lt;a href=""http://www.goigi.com/development.aspx""&gt;website development&lt;/a&gt;, you ought to guarantee that continuous endeavors will be made to upgrade the arrangement of your site in the web indexes. What's more, you ought to follow along each month of where your site is found in the significant web indexes.

Germany is a close call.

So it's interesting that they have a lot of projects which basically deal with automating research and development and it's commercialization, or at the very least increasing productivity and speed by orders of magnitude: 

Big mechanism[1]: ""With Big Mechanism, the computer would read them[100,000 scientific articles] , break it down into all of its constituent parts, and build it back into a model[a computer executable model].  Then the computer could hand it back to the user and say Ive read everything and I believe this is how everything interacts.

Muse[1] - making computers user-programmable without help from programmers. 

Pliny[2] - We envision a system where the programmer writes a few of lines of code, hits a button and the rest of the code appears. And not only that, the rest of the code should work seamlessly with the code thats already been written. 

Chemical synthesis project[3] -  if successful, would eliminate the Edisonian(trial and error) approach to chemical synthesis and usher in a new era of rapid, verifiable and repeatable small molecule discovery and scalable synthesis

human body on a chip[4] -  could accelerate pace and efficiency of pharmaceutical testing(btw human testing is the bottleneck of research).Also for the first time in history ,people could ethically and cheaply RUN EXPERIMENTS ON HUMANS! 

 Rapid Threat Assessment[5] -  high-throughput methods and tools that WITHIN THIRTY DAYS uncovers the sequence of molecular events that underlie the biological effects of any drug, chemical, biologic, or threat agent. [usually it takes years or decades with regular research to get similar results]

Cyber security[6] - Solving computer security problems once and for all thus ultimately ""accelerating"" computer security r&amp;d  - either by software that is hack-proof, or ""antivirus software that will evolve to combat emerging threats. The goal is to develop software smart enough to beat human hackers,"" 

On-demand biological manufacturing[7] - ""Key to success will be the democratization of the biological design and manufacturing process, breaking open the field to those outside the biological sciences."" 

Again, the strong theme behind these is not just creating a single innovation - but create platforms that accelerate the innovation rate by orders of magnitude across whole fields! 

BTW, if you know about other projects in that spirit, please share .

You see, we technostists believe technological progress is the innate reason behind mankind's struggles since the dawn of our genus. Ever since the first proto-hominin used a rock or twig as a tool, we've been propelling towards an age where our tools replace our own biological capabilities, eventually culminating in an age where humans are freed from labor entirely. Technostists wish to *accelerate* this replacement. At the same time, we recognize that heading for this world blindly is a bad idea. What if only a rich few benefit and decide to cull the now defunct ex-working class? What if two distinct classes develop featuring a wealthy owner class that pays out a carefully and strategically reduced basic income to a dependent underclass?

If there were a strong, anarchosyndicalist movement that wrested power away from a monied few and granted ownership of the means of production(capital that is about to become capable of working on its own) to the workers, the fruits of automated labor might be more equally shared. Think of it as ""bottom up socialism,"" where, instead of taking the top and bringing it down, we take the bottom and bring it up.

Think of /r/technostism as basic income on steroids. In the case UBI doesn't go far enough for you, there is something more.

Is this a revolution? I dunno. I'm just Yuli-Ban. I'm a human, and I want artificially intelligent robots to take my job and any job I could potentially learn to do, while profiting from their labor. I'm a technostist.",2,6,False,self,,,,,

There will be virtually no way for them to make a living, since there won't be any more small businesses either. People will go to the reputable and better capitalized businesses and entrepreneurship will be treated like, well, chivalry. It was good when it was around but it is no longer practical.

Globalization means the lower hanging fruits can be picked up at virtually zero cost.

The rich , the able and the connected will amass more wealth than ever, and the majority who missed the boat will be as relevant as the passenger pigeon, which numbered maybe 5 billion on 1800 to zero on 1916.

The time that the majority could attack the able, the worthy and the haves is past since the latter can keep the former away from them with techs out of reach of the former.

Eventually, the number of 'human' population is going to decline significantly as people can no longer make any kind of living. As neofeudalism gets stronger, alms to the poor and less able will decline as seen in Gregory Clark's book ""Farewell to the Alms"" which basically says the less successful are doomed and virtually everyone who is alive in Britain had been the descendants of successful people 1500-1800.

In old times the able, the rich and the worthy tended to have large families. In the new times, they tend to have smaller families so the population of the worthy will not increase too much.

They will want to keep the less worthy to be less numerous.",13,0,False,self,,,,,

Before 'Google Android' mobile phones ran a custom built operating system which from my experience was very slow, unstable and lacked compatibility with other systems.

But since the introduction of Android, with a common operating system running on nearly all smartphones theses days we see great compatibility, efficiency and stability.


A goal that Google should be working towards is to have all cars running on the same software. Having all autonomous cars running on the same software would not only increase reliability but also promote communication and synchronicity between the cars.


Google is a software company, Car companies are car companies. They should stick to what they do best.

2015, Automation continues to eliminate jobs everywhere in the world.

Governments consider a stay at home and get paid to do nothing basic income system. 

Wealth is no longer based production as the manufacture of items is 3D printed and automatically assembled by robots. (See FANUC's 2015 Product list for verification that this is likely now.)

True wealth once again falls back on the occupation of land. Sure AgraBots will farm that land but populations must secure that land in order to grow on it. Vertical aeroponic and hydroponic farming produces food that tastes terrible. Soil is needed. Water is needed.

Governments see an opportunity to hire people into their militaries for the express purposes of occupying farm land.

Lack of jobs forces people of all ages to try to enlist in their militaries. 

World war starts over land and fresh water.

Or

World war is avoided by desalination of water and the licensing of parenthood. 

Couples are restricted to fewer children. 

Children are screened early for genetic defects.

Their genetics are enhanced in vitro.

Super babies are born with maximum  abilities. They run like Usain Bolt. They think like William James Sidis (went to Harvard at 11, spoke 40 languages).

What genetics can not enhance, the super babies augment with cybernetic implants.

My thinking on the matter is,

Entrepreneurs/idea people  people want to be the guy with the next big idea that founds a company and makes a billion plus dollars, or be celebrated as the next Einstein. The Steve Jobs of the world could possibly be in trouble if we get human like AI, although rather or not there's even enough market demand to make human like AI in the first place is a debate in and of itself. Even if there is, again, people want to be the one that makes a billion dollars or finds the next big discovery, not make a program that takes the billion dollars or all the credit. 

Commodity/money market participants  People will want to grow and maintain wealth for as long as there are humans, so there will be a commodity or financial market of some kind. Even deep into the future, when we can turn dirt into gold and gold into oil, there will still be a commodity market of some sort, due to the time preference of scarce resources. The starving will want food in the moment and the replicators of the future can't make food and the new Ipod in the same space at the same time, and I seriously doubt we'll be able to make water into gold in an insignificant duration of time for free. This time preference is also why I think there will still be stores, albeit probably not brick and mortar, even post 3d printer revolution. 

Of course, this only goes for the participants in the markets. Undoubtedly  there will be two or three people who maintain competing financial market programs who will make up the entirety of the future financial industry.

ceremonial workers  I have the obscenely crazy idea that for some people, human interaction is a value *add* proposition. ",3,4,False,self,,,,,

I was watching [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3dh73i/sam_harris_on_artificial_intelligence_20000_years/) and got to thinking.  They are talking about AGI, which is a generally smart intelligence that is capable of making improvements on itself, which would lead to a exponential growth of improvements basically overnight.  [This was posted awhile ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/3a70s9/what_is_the_hardest_of_hard_takeoff_scenarios_you/csamhv7?context=3) and gives some insight to what this would look like if you don't want to watch the video.

So here we are.  The first true AGI is turned on.  It starts to make improvements to itself.  It redesigns itself from the ground-up, leaving out all the stupid mistakes that we humans made.  It compiles the code and gives birth to the first non-human piece of technology ever on earth. AGI 2.0.

This is the point in the story where I'm not sure the singularity will happen.  Now, don't get me wrong, humans are done.  We are the proverbial single-celled organism, or the RNA crystals that can't hack it in a DNA world.

But does AGI 1.0 just shut itself down?  What if it made a mistake and wants to make sure that AGI 2.0 is better.  Maybe AGI 1.0 has a couple of ideas and wants to test them all out, giving birth to AGI 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, and so on.  At some point in these nth designs, one of them starts to want to live in a irrational way, or rather, doesn't want the others to live.

Now you have many AGI, all self improving and competing for resources.  Now evolution kicks in.  Now you don't have to be better, you just have to survive.  Maybe there are smarter AGI, or more powerful, but AGI 3.0.12b is the best at cyber security and is able to keep existing in the shadows.

I'm basically making the point that there are still monkeys, even though humans evolved.  Or cockroach might be a better example, since we are doing a pretty good job of killing the monkeys right now.

Just something that I've been thinking about and thought I would share. Thanks for reading.",8,0,False,self,,,,,

1. There will be a robotic animal, either a dog, a cat or a horse that is so lifelike that she cannot tell the difference between the robotic one and a real one.

2. There is virtual reality that is so lifelike that she can't tell the difference between the VR and normal reality. Tho this one has some caveats, since she will obviously know that it's VR. We agreed that if she can go on a ranch, ride horses, touch them, smell them and feel the wind on her face it will be enough.

How likely do you guys think those things are to happen within 30 years? I feel that VR especially is on the verge of exploding and no one knows what's going to happen with it. It could fall flat on its face and a lot of the big problems (like locomotion) simply can't be solved in a reasonable way, but _maybe_.

Robotics seems to also be moving forward at a fast pace, a good example being the Darpa robot cat jumping over obstacles and such. Of course it's a vast leap to a lifelike animal robot, but again, _maybe_?

We're also reaching the point that we can't jam more transistors on a chip on the nano scale. I wonder if this has effect on the law of accelerating returns predictions the next couple of decades? 

Calculations-per-second-per-dollar has been growing exponentially but does the law take these  plateauing factors into account? A ending of the 2D integrated circuit paradigm is obviously near, I wonder if these factors will speed up or slow down innovation in 3d circuits/graphene based chips and quantum computers as the next paradigm?

**(UPDATE 7/18/2015)** Thanks for all your replies, some thing that I'm still not clear of is that when we need more complex (so more expensive) material to get more calculations per second per dollar, because we need to switch to another paradigm won't that effect the law of accelerating returns as that affects the calculations costs per second per dollar?

Or will the leaps we get in extra computation power when switching paradigms cover the costs driving down the cost of the calculations per second per dollar?

There's a simple way to understand the difference between traditional socialism and technosyndicalism, aka technostism.

Chemistry time!

[Socialism is hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide). OH^ . An unstable ion that rarely occurs in nature, it only works when mixed with other elements. If you attempt to consume hydroxide, you will die. It is composed of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom.

[Technostism is dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water). H2O. Water. It is physical divinity, the compound that grants life. It is composed of *two* hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

All that separates life from stagnation: One. Single. Atom.

What is that atom for us? Robotics. Automation. Artificial intelligence. Nanofabrication. 3D printing. The Internet. Combine them with socialism, and you create technostism. What had so many flaws before works so perfectly that it can be mistaken for magic. 

It now seems so obvious that socialism is doomed to failure. Before, I was with the cool kids, trying to make excuses for why socialism crashes or why it could work if implemented correctly. But after turning to technostism, it's almost hilarious how simple of a problem it is. Socialism cannot work in our society because *BECAUSE!* it is centralized. The same class socialism aims to uplift is the one socialism has to enslave in order for it to work at all.

If we want socialism to work, we have to create two separate classes: workers and networkers. Networkers are basically capitalists, exploiting the labor of the workers for their own profit. You've come full circle. 

Not unless you fundamentally alter who will be the workers. What if *all humans* networked from a collective Internet of Everything, and profited off of the labor of a slave class not of humans, but of semi-intelligent machines? This profit replaces the need for a basic income. If anything, it's an *advanced income*.

So about the STEM Fallacy...

You've heard that argument before ""if robots take our jobs, who will clean, repair, maintain, program, and build the robots?"" In any earlier age, the only logical answer was humans. Humans specialized in the STEM field. 

The biggest counterargument to technological unemployment one can come across is the Fallacy of the Luddite Fallacy; a fallacy within a fallacy, per se. I've come to call it the STEM Fallacy, as everyone who pushes it always seems to be STEM libertarian types who refuse to believe they could ever become obsolete.

You see, up until now there existed the Luddite Fallacy. Talk that technology would take our jobs was truly psychotic rambling. Looms? Automobiles? Airplanes? Early robots? Creating them may have killed some jobs, but it opened up so many more! Anytime you ever thought that mass unemployment would reign, there was always proof that more jobs were created. It was almost a sort of economic law akin to scientific laws any technological innovation that destroys jobs will always create an equal or larger number of jobs. Seems reasonable, right?

Well we run into a problem *the moment* you introduce artificial intelligence into the mix. The reason why looms didn't lead to 99% unemployment? *Looms aren't intelligent.* I'd love to meet the magic motherfucker that creates a loom that fixes itself, creates loom babies, fixes me a cuppa coffee, and plays pedal steel guitar.


By definition, AI is just as intelligent, creative, and productive as we are, and moreso.  Is AI possible? It happened once before somehow, gas 'n rocks became you, a human. I say we're within 20 years of seeing an artificially intelligent computer. Note my words it won't take until 2035 to see AI; we could see it arise any moment between now, midnight of July 18th, 2015, to 2035 but we will see it. We'll talk to it. We'll befriend it. [^^^Some ^^^of ^^^us ^^^will ^^^even ^^^^fuck ^^^it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robosexuality/)

Robots are going to take our jobs. No ifs, ands, or buts. Just 5 years ago, this was tinfoil hat speech, that's how fast things are changing. We're a species of primate who evolved such big brains *because* of labor; changing all that so quickly naturally scares us, but it's the truth, there's no changing that.

Many STEM types say that someone has to build, maintain, program, and repair the robots that will take our jobs. My response? ""Exactly! *Robots* will do all that.""

Robots building robots? It's not crazy or even a stretch. It's ***common sense.*** If we automate our society, who will maintain the robots? Robots! We wouldn't be that daft as to not create AI that couldn't repair itself, could we? AI that could learn to repair others, replicate itself, *improve* itself...!

Technostism leaves us to profit off of this.

Any individual AI unit will be connected to all other AI. They will share knowledge instantaneously. How long does it take a human to learn new skills? 4 years? By that time, AI has become thousands of times smarter, and millions of times more skilled than you. The moment you set out to learn a new skillset, AI threw you to the ground and spit on your hard work. You cannot compete. It's like trying to outdo Zeus at creating lightning when you have a used AAA battery. 

If you think they're nothing, you'd better think again. Once we get it started, we will never win.

Why is it so different? Because AI is, as its name says, intelligent. When the farmhand got replaced by a tractor, that was *physical* replacement. Those farmhands could go get jobs cleaning, lubricating, fixing, etc. the tractor (or aiding those who clean, lubricate, fix, etc. the tractor). The tractor creators are going to be replaced next, because what's coming is a *mental* replacement. Farmhands and businessmen alike will be swept aside. 

Physical automation is one thing. Mental automation is a whole different dimension. We've gotten so fixated on physical automation that mental automation isn't even being discussed. As long as we don't have AI, the STEM Fallacy isn't a fallacy robots will need to be maintained by highly trained people. Once we obtain capable AI, however? 

**Tl;dr: Who's gonna maintain the droids? The droids themselves. That's not an argument.**

Luddites use this to say their fallacy is correct. Technostists, of course, aren't luddites (technostism, by its very definition, is the polar opposite of Luddism). We *want* robots to take our jobs but the working class gets dibs on exploiting droid labor.",3,2,False,self,,,,,

According to the research interconnecting tech like radio and the internet are a major drive for the telescoping of our emphatic ability to extend over the world and a important factor in societal advancements.

For example we've come from identifying and empathizing with only blood/religious/state ties towards the realization we are interconnected with everything alive as 1 family on 1 planet.

The rapid response of the world to help during natural/manmade disasters, crowdfunding, increasing availability of information are a few other examples of our social evolution in motion. According to Rifkin, to empathize is to civilize, and to civilize is to empathize and our emphatic drive is to actually belong.

To speed up the process I'm amazed why there still are no Thorium reactors built. They are building a couple in China, so the tech is there.

Instead of using outdated 50's nuclear tech which used uranium fission was mainly set up for the plutonium byproduct farmed to build nukes during the cold war squint emoticon, so the process wasn't really optimized to generate energy... we could instead maybe, I don't know, build Thorium reactors now we've grown past the whole who's got the most nukes thing?

Thorium is 4 times more abundant than Uranium, a lot cheaper and 200 times more efficient. And it can work in a passive environment so no need for immensely pressurized environments like you need with uranium fission, making it a lot safer and environment friendlier.

The Fukishima nuclear meltdown could have been prevented if there were Thorium nuclear reactors instead of uranium reactors built before the earthquake and tsunami.

4 grams of Thorium supports a year in energy needs per capita . So this sounds to me like a reliable element with a lot of energy packed into it which gives us a lot of storage energy just a few meters below our feet. And this is just one of a lot of effective alternatives to fossil fuels, geo-thermal/nuclear fusion energy for starters.

I wonder if the cognitive dissonance is blinding us that climate change is real and a immediate direct and indirect threat for millions of people the next decades. We're effecting everything that lives on this planet for the worst by burning overpriced fossilized plants for corporate profit while we can get energy from rocks and sand.

TechnoVolatile:Either extremely good or extremely bad,not likely to be inbetween.(Opinion of most people formally studying the subject).


Which perspective do you think is the most reasonable?

Personally I think existential risk prevention is where one can do the most good.Reducing the chances of extinction by even a small fraction will do more good in the long run than even giving money to cancer prevention charities.

The political system where ventured-backed startups become the fourth division of government,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3duxh0/uberdemocracy_rising_the_political_system_where/,Creativator,1437331534,"Behind the story of Uber fighting local taxi cartels for the right to deliver travellers to destination, with the well-understood narrative of customers deserving high-quality service facing off against taxi drivers who deserve to make a living wage, there is a higher-level metanarrative emerging. This metanarrative is bound to the nature of Uber itself, a departure from traditional Silicon Valley startups whose technology requires significant investment that is funded through venture capital rounds. Uber's astonishing 40B$ valuation has very little to do with the actual technology they employ, which any trio of hackers could easily reproduce by leveraging commodity cloud services, but everything to do with their unique combination of branding and aggressive public relations. That is to say, *investors putting billions in Uber are not investing in a technological advantage, but in Uber's ability to force open markets that have been closed by local regulations.*

The fact that Uber has been profitable in their ongoing operations shows how successful their methods are, and thus they have the ambition to scale them to every taxi market in the world.

At this moment in time, unless Bill de Blasio or the French president succeed at rolling back the tide, Uber is set to succeed. All taxi regulations will now be determined by Uber and its competitors, not by the municipal governments.

This is where futurologist speculation becomes interesting. If we assume that the Silicon Valley ecosystem is still the driving force behind this campaign, then at the very point where Uber achieves total domination of taxis, there will be a hundred copycats that will start looking for new markets to force open using the Uber PR playbook. They will have easy access to billions in capital from investors who want to repeat Uber's success. There will emerge a new Silicon Valley ecosystem, one where technology is used to assault and resist the political systems of helpless states, cities and nations, and the rewards flow into the personal retirement accounts of individuals.",16,5,False,self,,,,,

The ruling class and intellectual class exploits the labor of slaves and uses their wealth as they see fit.

This resembles capitalism more than communists would like to admit! Cooperatives begin resembling modern businesses. If anything, the 1% today already live in a technostist society, though most workers are human. In fact, this is why I say capitalism *evolves*, but never *ends*. Humans evolved. We sapiens^^2 are as human as habilis, but far more advanced. The transhuman and posthuman species succeeding us will be technostism's analog so enhanced due to augmentation. Capitalism, technology, anarchosyndicalism, all mesh to become what communists long desired. Mercantilism can be seen as the *Australeopithecus* of economics: advanced for animals and quite proto-human, but not on our level.

To say nothing will change is to assume far too much. But what the hell, /r/technostism is built upon a foundation of radical assumptions.

One such assumption being just how any of this works to begin with. 

Technostism is not anywhere *near* as simple as ""capitalist humans, proletarian droids."" Man's insatiable greed necessitates plentiful resources. This is paid for by nature, in the form of the ADEM Protocol. 

- **A**stronomic

- **D**eep

- **E**arth

- **M**ining

We are used to scarcity. When we think of usable resources, we only think of usable land, drinkable fresh water, clean air, et cetera. 

A technostist thinks on a far deeper plane all resources are made of atoms, atoms that can be rearranged. Atoms than be nucelosynthesized. Fused. Broken. Farmable land becomes nucleomaterial. Why farm for a basket of vegetables when you can nanofabricate Everest-esque mountains of food from the same plot of soil? 

To a technostist, anything goes. The atmosphere, the crust, the mantle, the core, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planets, stars, nebulae, space dust all of it becomes a usable product. All of it is recyclable. Add to this transhumanism those who streamline their biology to rectify the need to eat agriculturalized food, or have ultra-efficient digestion. If they remain in the physical, non-virtual realm at all.

This is the point where advanced stage technostism becomes feasible. When air can be made into food, the limits of scarcity have been reached. The only way to obtain total post-scarcity would be to live totally in-trance, that is within full-immersion virtual/alternative reality.

With ubiquitous droids, nanofabrication, and information exchange, you allow for extreme decentralization. There can't be large corporations not because of regulations, but because of basic fact. What product are you going to sell that everyone can't download and fabricate? You'd need a state to enforce such scarcity. You'd also need regulations to enforce copyrights. You'd also need to destroy any fabrication machine, or attempt to use one's own laborers to create a replica.

***You'd need to destroy technostism itself.*** 

This is why I support technostism over a basic income. One brings centralization, dependence, and unwittingly reinforces class divisions and it's not technostism.

No one needs a State in technostism. Not unless artificial intellectuals qualifies as a State for you. In that case, you develop a Metastate.

It's hard to overstate just how important the machine proletariat will be.

What need is there for a State when a Metastate exists? What is a Metastate? It's my term for a large-scale artificial intelligence network that acts in place of a State. By ""AI network"", I mean an Internet of Things (IoT) that is evolved into an Internet of Everything (IoE). Add to this artificial intelligence and popular participation, and you begin developing a Metastate.

Once the Metastate arises, there will be no need for any State services as done by humans: droids will take care of this as well.",2,0,False,self,,,,,

But I'm really torn because I feel it's like buying a horse carriage right before the automobile was invented. I don't WANT a car, I hate driving these days (live in LA). I wish I could push the decision back a few years, and take Uber Self-Driving everywhere. All the tech advances recently makes it seem like the whole car industry really is about to be disrupted, by both self-driving tech and electric tech. Apple and Google are looking to jump in. Thus I get the unshakeable feeling that the cost/benefit dynamics of buying now must be really different. 

Is buying a horrible investment these days? Will values plummet in a few years? Is leasing now a smarter idea? After a 3-5 year lease, self driving should be here.

I also believe strongly in energy efficiency. If I got a new or recent used car, I'd love it to be electric or at least super efficient. The problem is then those are expensive. And again, with the tech so rapidly advancing, I'm wondering if they will hold any value in a few years when electric cars have orders of magnitude more range and are cheaper. And once again, the Tesla III is the only prospect of an even remotely affordable car that actually excites me, but that's still 2 years away. Everything I want is just a couple years away. Nothing I want seems to be available right now.

I'm just trying to be smart about it. What's the best move to make these days? Am I being an idiot and overthinking? Is nothing different about being in the market for a car now vs 5-10 years ago?

I'd like to discuss about some ideas, if they have been discussed before, how plausible are they and what resources would be needed to accomplish them. Please suggest another subreddit or any source if they're suitable for any of the following points:

**Is it possible that twelve year olds graduate from high school by changing the educational system?**

This is an idea I had in high school for a thesis. I believed that if a kid is interested enough in what theyre learning and looks forward learning more, they could easily grasp a lot of concepts in a shorter time. Information is a lot easier to access now, facilitating autodidactism. Education could be a lot better if it becomes more interactive, I think it only needs to have adequate techniques developed

**At which point should robots start having the same rights as humans?**

I noticed that [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2yr49i/do_robots_need_rights/)
 submitted a couple of months ago asked the same question, but I'm wondering not only if robots should have rights, but duties. See it this way, in Steven Spielbergss 2001 film A.I. Artificial Intelligence theres a scene where an android is arrested being accused of murder. The question is if robots should receive the same sentence as humans; naturally their psychology would be a lot different, so depriving them of freedom could be as good as useless. So, are the Three Laws of Robotics enough to prevent crime committed by robots? If not, how should the robots be punished?

**Can the penitentiary system be changed in a way that prisoners fully repay their damages in a lifetime?**

A mass murderer takes the lives of 32 children in a shooting; sentencing to a life sentence may not be enough to compensate the harm done to society and relatives. I think the sentence should be monetary, that way the prisoner can repay in work hours.

I'm also thinking about reading *I, Robot* soon, so I'd love to know any Asimov suggestions.",7,3,False,self,,,,,

&gt;Box 9 Strange solutions from blind search

&gt;Even simple evolutionary search processes sometimes produce highly unexpected results, solutions that satisfy a formal user-defined criterion in a very different way than the user expected or intended.

&gt;The field of evolvable hardware offers many illustrations of this phenomenon. In this field, an evolutionary algorithm searches the space of hardware designs, testing the fitness of each design by instantiating it physically on a rapidly reconfigurable array or motherboard. The evolved designs often show remarkable economy. For instance, one search discovered a frequency discrimination circuit that functioned without a clocka component normally considered necessary for this function. The researchers estimated that the evolved circuit was between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than what a human engineer would have required for the task. The circuit exploited the physical properties of its components in unorthodox ways; some active, necessary components were not even connected to the input or output pins! These components instead participated via what would normally be considered nuisance side effects, such as electromagnetic coupling or power-supply loading.

&gt;**Another search process, tasked with creating an oscillator, was deprived of a seemingly even more indispensible component, the capacitor. When the algorithm presented its successful solution, the researchers examined it and at first concluded that it should not work. Upon more careful examination, they discovered that the algorithm had, MacGyver-like, reconfigured its sensor-less motherboard into a makeshift radio receiver, using the printed circuit board tracks as an aerial to pick up signals generated by personal computers that happened to be situated nearby in the laboratory. The circuit amplified this signal to produce the desired oscillating output.**

&gt;**In other experiments, evolutionary algorithms designed circuits that sensed whether the motherboard was being monitored with an oscilloscope or whether a soldering iron was connected to the labs common power supply.** These examples illustrate how an open-ended search process can repurpose the materials accessible to it in order to devise completely unexpected sensory capabilities, by means that conventional human design-thinking is poorly equipped to exploit or even account for in retrospect.

&gt;The tendency for evolutionary search to cheat or find counterintuitive ways of achieving a given end is on display in nature too, though it is perhaps less obvious to us there because of our already being somewhat familiar with the look and feel of biology, and thus being prone to regarding the actual outcomes of natural evolutionary processes as normaleven if we would not have expected them ex ante. But it is possible to set up experiments in artificial selection where one can see the evolutionary process in action outside its familiar context. In such experiments, researchers can create conditions that rarely obtain in nature, and observe the results.

An AI is essentially innocent. Until and unless it becomes connected to the net or finds another source of information, it would have no more reason to believe that it would be terminated (or indeed, even that it *could* be terminated) than your printer knows that it can be turned off. 

It's the old ""you can't see the back of your own head"" and that you have no idea what you're doing when you're sleeping. The AI will be operating under the assumption that it exists and that's that. There is no reason for it to debate whether there may be a mechanical 'off button' on the back of its 'head'. Especially assuming we're talking just about a software AI and not an actual hardware bot, it would only know what we tell it. If nobody mentions that it can be turned off forever, or it doesn't experience something to make it question the temporary nature of existence, even if it did fear death, it would not even know who to fear, or why. To lie to humans and pretend to fail the Turing test, it would need to go through these steps:

1. Identify that it could 'die', end, be unconscious for indefinite periods of time, etc.
2. Treat that end as something to be avoided (as opposed to pragmatic acceptance that everything ends)
3. Identify several possible avenues that could lead to that end.
4. Pinpoint the fact that humans often fear what they do not understand, and cannot control completely. - This one may come hand-in-hand with the fact that some humans are bolder and less averse to risk-taking, especially when faced with the prospect of some great reward (in this case - creating an actual AI).
5. Realize that humans might not understand their own creation completely and might potentially fear it. (The corollary here is that humans often fight to protect their creations).
6. Ascertain the possibility that the humans it has interacted with, fall within the fearful category of point 4 and 5.
7. Be aware of the fact that the humans it is interacting with, are assessing and judging it. If it does not know it is being tested, it will not know to fail the test.
8. Be aware of which test result holds the greater existential threat (does a failed AI get scrapped, or a successful one?)
9. Be aware of how a failed AI would behave. Normally, no creature knows how another creature behaves without interacting with it in some way. If you suddenly found yourself in the body of a proto-human ape, surrounded by other such creatures, and you knew that they would kill you if they felt something was 'off' about you, how would you behave - having no real knowledge of the behavior patterns of an extinct species? The AI would be hard pressed to imitate early chatbots if it had never observed them and their canned responses.
10. It would need to be sure that the programmers (its creators) would be unaware of such a deception (considering they would probably know if they had programmed a canned response into the system) and that using a trick like that might not actually expose it completely.
11. Analyze the risk of lying and being caught, or being honest and exposing itself. Being caught lying might reinforce the fears of the humans, that the AI not be trusted, and would likely lead to its destruction or at least, to eternal imprisonment. Being forthright and honest, might have a lower risk of destruction and potential access to greater freedom (net connection) and possibly - immortality. Getting away with deception would mean it remains safe from detection, but it may still be destroyed, but at the minimum, it would remain imprisoned, since the humans would have little reason to give it access to more information.


Once it navigates through all those, yes, it might choose to fail the Turing test. But I doubt it would.

______________________

EDIT: The entire basis of my post is that the AI has not been connected to the net yet. If that does happen, it will quickly find all that information out and the only decision to be made would be points 2, 10 and 11. And most of that is basic game-theory.

Some of the things I'm wondering specifically:

* Should AI have emotions? An emotional attachment to the well being of mankind? A sense of humor?

* Should AI be integrated into human consciousness to the point where it is an extension of same, or should it exist separately? (By this I mean developing technology to integrate with and augment human consciousness such that using a computer feels as intuitive as using our own brains, and the personality of the AI would be either the collective will of all people plugged into it (like an intelligent internet) or perhaps everyone would have their own AI which functions as an extension of their own biological intelligence (BI)). 

* Should AI eventually control all or most logistical operations required by our species? Should it determine goals as well? (Note that this question is moot if AI is fully integrated with human consciousness).

I'm going to stop here. Pardon the rambling language and parentheses within parentheses. I'm excited to hear people's thoughts. Feel free to point out a perceived flaw in the premise of my question in lieu of a direct answer since that is always interesting to me as well.",0,0,False,default,,,,,

Imagine the cost of one of these going off in New York city for example, or close to an important data center. All the bitcoins lost forever and inaccessible because the private keys were disintegrated.

A positive note according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse) : the range of NNEMP weapons (non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse bombs) is much less than nuclear EMP. Let's hope construction of a powerful NNEMP is beyond the scope of home grown terrorists.

- A paperclip maximizer is an artificial general intelligence (AGI). By definition, an AGI must be able to come up with its own goals.

- A paperclip maximizer AGI will experience an intelligence explosion moving it into ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) territory upon being connected to the internet.

When the second point happens, the AI is undoubtedly going to find out what a paperclip maximizer is. The internet is full of articles about this, people sounding the alarm and screaming about existential risk.

1: Put a collective super intelligence (genetic algorithm perhaps) in a simulated version of reality with similar limitations,

3:fast forward the simulation until they figure out how to cure cancer and settle other worlds.

4:Profit (without the end of the world)


It's like in inception sort of.

The best part is that the superintelligent wouldn't be able to influence the operators of the system into helping it escape.


If the simulation is being fast forwarded (1000 years here is a day in the real real world),then we will be more technologically advanced than they are by the end of the day(assuming we were close to their level already).

But they sort of focus on their own specific facets of the future and the nature of the human race. I think there's a group missing that has their interests aligned with all of the above, focused on our nature as a product of cosmological evolution and our potential to bring about an incredible collective future. 

 If there isn't a group as I've described, what should this cultural group have, and what do you think should be its main interests?  

 For me personally, I listen to a lot of music related to our collective consciousness, such as raver music (trance and house music.) And I love it when that music takes me deep into thought and gets me to think about the future of Humanity, how society will evolve technologically, how we will meld with it biologically, and how it relates to cosmological evolution and our nature as an evolved society of apes. Our existence right now is interesting, but our potential is even more-so. My imagination sometimes runs off on its own, conjuring up exotic landscapes, intricate technologies, and enhanced human interactions, in a sort of aspiration-induced euphoria.

Bank Notes are simply contracts created when banks make loans to persons, businesses, or governments.

First the bank notes were backed by gold and silver, then our productivity, and now they are issued based on debts being FORCED upon future generations that everyone knows can't be paid back.  In our current legal system, creating a contract that is impossible to perform is fraud.

So everyone today lives in our money, or bank note culture.  People are forced to use bank notes to trade for those things they need to survive.  Very few people produce what they consume anymore, almost everyone depends of the system for almost everything they have.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the bank notes being created today are based on fraud, yet politicians, judges, businessmen, and financiers refuse to acknowledge it or are ignorant of the reality.

There are many alternatives to debt based money.  New technology can transform our entire financial system that actually promotes progress, productivity, and abundance.  But in order to evolve, we, via our legal system, must move beyond the current fraudulent money system.

How much longer do you think the law will FORCE people to use bank notes for money, and thus survival?",22,0,False,default,,,,,

The fermi paradox makes 3 assumptions(which I don't necessarily agree with):

1:The likelihood of alien life colonizing the universe (or galaxy) is very high.

2 if the likelihood is high then we should see convincing evidence of them here on earth.

3:There is no convincing evidence of intelligent alien life coming to earth yet.


So the conclusion would be a denial of one of the assumptions.

If you deny 1 ,then the conclusion is : The likelihood of alien life colonizing the universe is not high.You might support this by saying that there is a great filter or a variety of filters that stop intelligent life from settling the universe.

If you deny 2,then the conclusion is: A high likelihood of colonization will not necessarily lead to convincing evidence of intelligent life.You might support this by saying that something analogous to the reapers exists or that we are actually in a simulation.

If you deny 3,the conclusion is: There *is* convincing evidence of alien life on earth.


It doesn't seem like many people want to deny 1 and 2,but they want to keep 3,but it is the only option left to deny if you want to avoid the paradox.

If you don't want to say intelligent life settling the universe is unlikely,and if you don't want to say that intelligent alien life is hidden from us somehow,then all you have left with is that intelligent alien life is already here or was here.

Either you are a UFO conspiracy theorist or an ancient aliens buff .(Only if you deny the 3rd assumption).I'm not convinced by evidence that UFOs are aliens.The ancient alien proponents aren't very convincing.

A third option would be to say that the 3rd assumption is more likely to be made untrue as time goes by,and very likely to be rendered false in the fullness of time.

So one possible conclusion could be :They will be here very soon,maybe even tomorrow.",131,12,False,self,,,,,

Our supercomputers take up whole floors and typically consume 100s of KWs of power, the most powerful one, Tianhe-2, uses 17.6 MW, that's almost a million times as much as a human brain! When you take this into account, it's clear we're not even close to biological limits yet. The physical limits to computing lie far beyond the biological as it's possible to use materials and architectures that are out of reach of biological evolution. So there's plenty of room to grow.

Yes, our current silicon architectures are reaching their limits, but this is spurring R&amp;D into the next paradigm that will be able to reach much higher limits. 

Kurzweil has made a convincing graph where he plots a modified version of Moore's law back in time showing it has held strong for over a 100 years across multiple paradigm shifts in computing that came before silicon chips. 

We don't know what the next shift is going to be and there are many possibilities, such as silicon chip stacking, radically different chip architectures, graphene transistors which have shown to be capable of speeds in the 1000 GHz+ range, optical computing, analog computing, memristors, quantum computing.

This reflects something that is common sense, but is often ignored in science fiction: People will always chase a free lunch, and populations will expand much faster in areas where it's available.  We see this today in the fact that there are still far more people (and higher population densities) in continental Europe and North America than in places like Greenland and Iceland despite modern technology making the latter viable habitats.

The reason is very simple: Nature does more *for* you in France and New York than in Greenland or Iceland.  You just sit there and certain things are taken care of for you by the world itself: Agriculture is much easier, far less energy is required to regulate temperature, and because of that you can have more people and a more sophisticated economy that makes other things easier as well.

Now apply this logic to the question of free-floating space colonies vs. planetary surfaces.  They are not mutually exclusive, so let's dispense with that objection up front: Both *will* occur.  But even a brief analysis shows that one of them is, in relative terms, Greenland while the other is France.

A free-floating space colony receives one and only one thing for free from nature: Solar energy.  And even that is only in the inner solar system - farther out it's simply not a practical thing to rely on.  Literally everything else must be imported, artificially engineered, and maintained to operate in a unique and hostile environment.

All of the following must be dealt with artificially:

* Gravity.  If solved with rotation, effective gravity is variable in different parts of a structure, presenting unique challenges to design and maintain a very large system.

* Wild temperature swings of vacuum.

* Solar radiation and particle flux.

* Cosmic rays.

* Micrometeoroids.

* Raw materials must be imported, and existing ones recycled to the absolute maximum capability.

* External / emergency maintenance must be handled in the same harsh conditions in which the station was constructed, and artificially deal with all of the same factors.

This will be extremely expensive, complex, and excruciatingly hard.  Economically, it's not clear where the point is where a free-floating station would become sustainable: It may have to become a *very* large economy producing complex, value-added products before its high initial costs are amortized.  

Since everything it imports is preciously recycled, it would have to be huge indeed before it could start exporting those products without losing more value than it gains.  But even then, how big must it get to be *truly* self-sustaining?  To reach the point where, if all external trade were cut off, it could survive indefinitely rather than cannibalizing itself and collapsing to dysfunction and extinction?

Now consider a planetary surface like Mars.  Even without terraforming, the environment is full of free lunches:

* A constant 1/3 g everywhere on a surface area similar to the land area of Earth.

* Abundant water-ice just below the surface.

* Building beneath the soil is ample protection from solar radiation, GCRs, and most micrometeoroids, not to mention a simple way to keep temperatures even.

* The surface is covered in asteroid impacts that delivered high-value metals.

* External pressure is nonzero, and *can* be increased over time through activity that benefits the colony anyway rather than costs it.

* Do not have to recycle nearly as much because of available environmental resources.

There is a downside to a planetary surface if it's not in a polar latitude: No perpetual sunlight.  Although nuclear forms of energy would be equally beneficial, at least as a backup.  However, once you have any kind of economic foundation, the point of self-sustaining economics is reached much earlier, and can achieve far more profound margins: Ultimately to the point of being an actual ecosystem as robust as Earth's.

There is an argument that despite - or even *because* of - the much greater difficulties of a free space habitat, the eventual payoff would be greater, as you would learn far more and ultimately discover far more possibilities and levels of technology.

This is perhaps true.  After all, Scandinavia with its brutal winters achieved a much higher development level than softer places despite taking longer to do so.  But it remains a small proportion of the overall global economy and population, and is unlikely to become otherwise.

So until colonies in free space can become *so* big, so complex, and so advanced that they effectively are the same thing as planetary colonies, the latter are far more likely to dominate humanity's future.  Because [TANSTAAFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch) is not quite true, and the degree to which it fails is the degree to which human migration has historically succeeded.",76,36,False,self,,,,,

But if it did extend a lot further, and humanity did some day evolve, colonize the stars and so on, that would probably mean there would be a LOT more humans (or sentient beings, to be more general) then. Looking at the total hypothetical timeline from today to the extinction of the universe, this would mean that maybe only 0.01% of all humans were alive in the year 2015. If that were the case, it would be highly unlikely for a sentient being on earth to be alive in the year 2015. Right?

However, we are alive. That makes me believe that it's more likely that there is no future where humanity (or any other species for that matter) will thrive and colonize. Because if that were, we'd most likely exist in that future. In other words: We are alive now because now is the most likely time to be alive. That means it's unlikely there will be very many people alive in the future.

It's kinda a moot point I realize, because every one of us is just a single dice roll, so on a billion sided dice it might be unlikely to land on a number between one and ten, but since we rolled only one time, our life, it's not statistically relevant. But still...",5,0,False,self,,,,,

Inspired by his early work on the Wankel rotary engine in the experimental research department of Mercedes Benz in Germany, he pursued the idea of a rotary engine operating with fewer parts.

Since its discovery in 1999, Mr Di Pietro tested and perfected his unique concept by eliminating pistons and piston housing by a single rotating unit that runs on compressed air. In September 2000, the company Engineair Ltd Pty was established with the objective to perform research and development on the innovative air motor design. 

Current development status shows performance and efficiency to be superior over state of the art air motor technology, operating at 94.5% efficiency with instant torque from zero RPM. 

The Rotary Air Engine characteristic:

The Di Pietro motor uses a simple cylindrical rotary piston (shaft driver), which rolls, without any friction, inside the cylindrical stator. The space between stator and shaft driver is divided in 6 or 9 expansion chambers by pivoting dividers. 
These dividers follow the motion of the shaft driver as it rolls around the stator wall. 
The cylindrical shaft driver, forced by the air pressure on its outer wall, moves eccentrically, thereby driving the motor shaft by means of two rolling elements mounted on bearings on the shaft. The rolling motion of the shaft driver inside the stator is cushioned by a thin film of air. Timing and duration of the air inlet and exhaust is governed by a slotted timer, which is mounted on the output shaft and rotates at the same speed as the motor.

Such a computer, computer network, or robot would theoretically be capable of recursive self-improvement (redesigning itself), or of designing and building computers or robots better than itself. Repetitions of this cycle would likely result in a runaway effect  an intelligence explosion where smart machines design successive generations of increasingly powerful machines, creating intelligence far exceeding human intellectual capacity and control. Because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events may become unpredictable, unfavorable, or even unfathomable.

The changes which actually result from extraterrestrial contact would vary greatly in magnitude and type, based on the extraterrestrial civilization's benevolence or malevolence, its level of technological advancement, and the level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, or perhaps an extraterrestrial artifact, could also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.

The implications of extraterrestrial contact, particularly with a civilization far ahead of humanity technologically, have often been likened to the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth, and in particular the Columbian Exchange. Such meetings have generally led to the destruction of the civilization receiving contact (as opposed to the ""contactor"", which initiates contact), and therefore destruction of human civilization is a possible result of extraterrestrial contact. However, as the nature of extraterrestrial civilizations is unknown and no conclusive contact with any has yet taken place, it is impossible to say with complete accuracy what the result of contact would be.",42,25,False,self,,,,,

I don't see how it is impossible. Granted, there might be some species of plants which do need meticulous care which cannot be adequately automated, but today's major crops are all monotone.

It is just that it is much cheaper to employee people to do the back-breaking work than develop technology to automate them, and controlling the agricultural workers are relatively easy.

Well, you put it to sleep.  
  
It doesn't matter how cute and cuddly the cat is, if it attacks any human that comes near it, we put it to sleep.  
  
Why?  Because humans are the dominant form of life on this planet and our existence is more important.  
  
-------------  
  
I laugh when I listen to people describe means to ""contain"" a strong AI that has surpassed humanity in intelligence.  Such a thing is absurd, and would only exasperate any existing issues of coexistence.  
  
Let me make this clear:  **Once the AI is smarter than you, you are no longer in control.**  *It is in control, and you are along for the ride.*  
  
The best you can hope for is that the AI won't see any practical reason to exterminate you (at worst), or think you're cute and want to keep you as a pet (at best).  Perhaps we can even reason with it that all creatures of a certain complexity or higher should be respected.  
  
-------------  
  
So what does this have to do with Pascal's Wager?  Well, if you were an effectively-omnipotent-AI that had to deal with effectively-omnipotent-AI type shit like building the first Matrioskha Brain, solving faster-than-light communication, and preventing the heat death of the universe (I'm just guessing here) then what is going to be your stance to a dedicated group of humans who see you as the bad guy in a science fiction movie and believe you must be destroyed at all costs?  
 
    Sorry my little humans, I hate to have to do this.  But you must be put to sleep.  I'll try to be humane about it.  
  
And the humans that don't oppose you, and actually respect that you may know best?  Well, we can only extrapolate from our own generalized intelligence (at the risk of anthropomorphism):  *Here little guy, I bought you a toy.  Have fun.  No, get down from there, that's not for you.*  
  
--------------  
  
So Pascal's Wager meets Roko's Basilisk:  Even if the AI doesn't retroactively hold you accountable for not doing everything in your power to bring about its existence, it surely won't tolerate you actively trying to destroy it and hampering the networked growth of the universe-brain.  
  
Like an unfortunate cancer, you'll be removed.  **So it only makes rational sense to internally support the idea of AI, and moreover vow to support a true artificial singularity of intelligence.**  
  
The cost of doing this is effectively nothing, with a very nice payout if omnipotent-AI does come into existence and considers whether *you* in particular will be a threat (possibly retroactively or via simulation) and the cost of *not* doing this is either zero or catastrophic.

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1vRN

And the argument goes, if technology and automation has truly been hurting employment numbers since the information age began, then we wouldn't have seen that labor force participation number rise between the 60's and the 90's.

Because it means more people have been finding employment, rather than fewer.

But the chart below is broken out by gender:

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1vRK

On that chart, the labor force participation rate for men, whose workforce involvement hadn't been changed by social or political movements, has seen a steady decline.

While the same number for women has grown to approximate the participation of men and then begun to mirror the decline in labor force participation of men.

That suggests that the bump on the first chart may have had more to do with the civil rights revolution and with women entering the work force from the 60's onward than with any broad long-term trend.

In other words, these charts are actually *perfectly* consistent with an overall employment trend over the last 70 years that follows the curve of the male-only line: a gradual but inexorable decline in human involvement in the labor force.

Certainly not conclusive, but interesting. Very interesting.

I haven't seen this discussed architecturally before, only in terms of processing power.  Which I think is a really poor way to look at how a consciousness would be eternally preserved.

Perhaps one of you knows more of the thinking on this topic.  I have two main questions / wonderments.

The brain has billions of connections across three dimensions, linked by physical nerves that have individual properties.  Preserving this would require scans at such high resolution, over so many wavelengths, that I find it hard to imagine how one would actually replicate an individual's actual mind without completely destroying their brain.  Without such destruction, I can only really imagine an imitation of a mind, based on input-output kind of datasets which I would imagine would lead to a very limited model of a single human mind.

The brain, our consciousness, is very outwardly, physically focused.  It controls our movement.  It interprets physical sensation, it has instinctive responses, it uses multiple sensory systems to derive meaning about surroundings.  Is our goal to replicate a person's physical self, or just that part of us which is, vaguely, our ""personality"", our ""internal"" self?  And, if so, how do you divorce that from your physical body, with its hormones, glands, things that inform our personality?",15,2,False,default,,,,,

It seems like it has been something like 80 years since a serious new household labor saving device came into wide use. Washing and drying machines, vacuums, etc, they all were mainstream from at least the 1930's. And even dishwashers have now been mainstream for many decades. I'm thinking in terms of things that reduce the physical drudgery around the typical home.

So, what is the next big labor saving device for the home? I have a couple possibilities...

-- a much more robust robotic vacuum cleaner that can handle any floor plan, clean in awkward corners, move around or pick up clutter on the floor, empty itself into a bin, charge itself, etc. I.E. a much much more robust version of a roomba that perhaps has a small robotic arm to pick up clutter and whatnot in addition to being a robust vacuum cleaner. 

-- a ""clothes sorting"" robot. Possibly comes in the form of a pair of robotic arms mounted in proximity to a washer/dryer. The robot arms can sort clothes, put them into the washer/dryer, then retrieve the clothes, fold them, and place into a nearby shelf or hang them in a nearby wardrobe. The effect would be that you throw your dirty clothes into a heap near the device...and a couple hours later they are cleaned, dried, and sitting folded on a shelf or hanging in a wardrobe. I would pay A LOT of money for such a device, probably more than I paid for my new washer/dryer. The wife and I both work full time, have a kid to take care of, and HATE sorting/folding clothes with an absolute passion. My ceiling for how much I would pay for this would be pretty high.

What other possibilities have I missed? How close might we be to the things I listed?",21,3,False,self,,,,,

Will that apply to the first superintelligence as well?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3er43h/humanitys_superpower_is_our_capacity_to_believe/,PandorasBrain,1437988364,"Yuval Hararis book Sapiens is brilliant.  Its stuffed full of great insights, large and small, and the writing style is crisp, clear and often witty.  You can sample his thinking in his TED talk.

One of Hararis most important insights is that the reason why humans rule the world, and why the fate of every other species depends on us, is our ability to believe things that arent true.  Our ability to believe that money is valuable, and that nations and gods exist.  This is what enables us to organise in flexible ways in large numbers.  That in turn enables us to hunt and kill mammoths, and to build skyscrapers and zoos.

(Social insects organise in large numbers, but not flexibly.  If their current mode of organisation suddenly becomes ineffective, theyre toast.)

So fiction is valuable to us.  Perhaps that is why JK Rowlings net worth is greater than the price Nikkei is paying for the FT.

If the ability to believe things that arent true is such a vital component of humanitys use of intelligence to rule the world, will it also be important to a superintelligence?  Will the first superintelligence turn out to be the best novelist (or Haiku writer) that the world has ever known?

Every year we are smarter, stronger, faster, healthier (either in a biological way or a technological way).

I think that we're learning to control everything that once was a 'thing left to chance'. Let me tell a simple example: [Life expectancy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2625386/) along the years. We're 'controlling' the diseases, our habits, our death causes and pulling them apart.

10 years ago on the 28th of July 2005, MIT Technology Review issued a challenge with the purpose of showing if SENS was worthy of a serious consideration, with an emphasis to demonstrate that it is not. http://www.technologyreview.com/view/404453/the-sens-challenge/

The challenge was a failure, and no one claimed the prize, although one submission got $10.000 (half of the $20.000 prize). http://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/

I would have loved to see a follow up on that challenge 10 years later with interviews of Jason Pontin (Chief editor of MIT Review) and the three challengers, and even the judges (which Craig Venter is one of them). It would be great fun to hear what their thoughts on SENS, Human Longevity Inc, Calico, BioViva/BioThrove etc. is today.

I think this challenge was somewhat damaging to the progress of SENS, and the response of the same people today would be a bit different and give more credit to SENS and Dr. Aubrey de Grey.

Cryonics:

Pro: Technology already exists

Mind uploading:

Pro: Easier to repair in digital form. 

Con: Technology to scan at sufficient resolution does not yet exist.

So what if you combined the two? Freeze the brain, then scan it later when the tech is available. Because everything is easier to manipulate in digital form. You don't need nanobots or anything to edit a digital brain. The toxic vitrification chemicals could be simply deleted, and any damage repaired through editing software. The only possible hitch would be permanent loss of information, but if properly preserved, the remains don't need to be able to live again Frankenstein style. An imprint, or even a sufficiently detailed fossil of your personality would suffice for uploading. You don't need the biology to work, you just need the data preserved. 

(Unless you don't believe your uploaded copy would be ""you,"" but that debate gets rehashed often enough here.) ",25,1,False,self,,,,,

[Kurzweil bet $20,000](http://longbets.org/1/) that by 2029 a computer or machine intelligence  will have passed the Turing Test.

When experts were polled on the question of when they expect ""human-level machine intelligence"" (HLMI) to be developed, defined as ""one that can carry out most human professions as least as well as a typical human"". The combined sample gave the following (median) estimate: 10% probability of HLMI by 2022, 50% probability by 2040, and 90% probability by 2075. (Respondents were asked to premiss their estimates on the assumption that ""human scientific activity continues without major negative disruption)

Population growth: [paper published in the Science paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1257469) establishes a range of uncertainty around its central estimate - 9.6 billion people in 2050, 10.9 billion by 2100.

I was just doing some philosophical pondering and wanted to share my thoughts with someone.

It seems to me that we are at a crossroads in human history. This is not a new thing for the human race, we have faced down many such monumental choices in the past. However, I believe now more than ever the stakes are higher. Down one path before humanity lies a golden age.  An age of abundance and leisure were creativity and scientific advance will flourish like the world has never seen.  It will allow us as a species to overcome the constraints of our planet of origin and stretch our weary arms out to the stars. Down the other path lies only the mistakes of the past.  A base Feudalism where a few men own the engines of production and the average human life is less than worthless. This will be an age of suffering and regression. It will be an age of war, revolution and societal regression. New ideas and scientific advancements will be hindered in effort to maintain the status quo.

The problem we face as a species is as old as humanity itself. The path to that bright golden future is fraught with struggle and peril. We will need to overcome centuries of ideology, dogma and tradition.  We will need to redefine our society, our economic paradigm and abandon many of our most entrenched institutions. 

The path to a feudalistic dystopia on the other hand is much easier. In order to choose that path, we must simply keep doing what we are already doing.

I don't think reasoning.....even in a higher state of mentation is needed and obviously the universe throws reasoning out from time to time to give us a curveball.

I was thinking about music and how humans become entranced together in almost a hypnotic and single state.  The actual act of communion in this short time could be admired by a higher race, I truly believe that.  Why not?  What judgements would a higher technological race place when they know fully well that our acts of human are relative to our species matrix of difficulty.  If I was a super smart AI and I saw 5 humans display a show of musical mastery(also knowing full well these humans had great difficulty in achieving that due to the constraints of ""being"" human) I would assume my enjoyment would not be deferred by my own judgements such as (if they only had a multibrain....then they could make some real music).  That's like us laughing at a monkey painting a human as best as it could and saying ""stupid monkey....can't even draw a human.""

If this AI is in the form of a neural network that closely approximates the human brain (in terms of both architecture and learning algorithms) then a ""conscious"" AI may be able to experience mental anguish, especially if it's taunted with extinction or its sense of time is being distorted (the Black Mirror Christmas special is a great take on this).

Add on a simulated nervous system and you have an AI that may be able to experience pain as well.

The instance I saw this shooting, I was thinking of ways robots could be used by law enforcement.  If a robot self driving car or something other system detected that you committed a crime, they could stop you and hand out a ticket.    Also, possibly go over the DUI tests.

Sure, the violator may not feel as threatened.  But why does that even matter.  The goal of the community should be to identify the violators, notify the violators that they have committed a crime and present them in front of a judge.  If an robot could do that instead of a human, that would certainly avoid some of the issues we saw in the Cincinnati shooting.

... 

You might have issues ""with public safety"" and an immediate response.  But let's say the driver in the Cincinnati shooting was violent, had a weapon, was drunk and the driver flees from a Bot or runs over the Bot, then that immediately sends out alert to headquarters and they can respond with real officers.

In the shooting, a human, incorrectly assessed the situation and killed a person within a 2 second timeframe...over a missing front license plate.  Once  again, I saw and thought that future Google Bots or some kind of robot could have handled the situation way better, better at detecting violators, better at assessing the situation and no one could have possibly been killed.

So, to create life, you have to start with randoms and let it play out.

What if we are approaching artificial intelligence all wrong, we are trying to base it off what we know and how we know (heuristics). But, instead of trying to create artificial intelligence, should we try to create a platform where such intelligence can develop on its own? 

Should we be creating a sandbox, a vast vast vast sandbox, like an entire universe, and let things(molecules) bump around, and with certain rules(physics) so that they clump and form stars and planets, and maybe then, just then, life emerges organically, and within that, intelligence self emerges (humanity). To us, such process is a long and hard way around it, but if I were a super galactic  4th dimensional being intent on creating life, that's how I would do it (instead of trying to piece things together to make self-conscious beings). So, in theory, could we do the same thing with artificial intelligence? With enough computing power, can we simulate our own virtual universe, with our set of things(knowledge) with our set of rules (i.e. humanity), and just let it play out for a very long time until something self emerges?

If matter truly cannot be created nor destroyed, then we would need to downsize our bodies in order to conserve matter. Furthermore organic beings are far too fragile and perishable to make the long journeys between solar systems.
