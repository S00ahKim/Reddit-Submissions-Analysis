2) Eventually the disparity between those who are poor and those who are rich will be felt by those who can extend their lives to decades or centuries beyond the poor.
3) We have a vested interest in creating a finite life span. 

When I think about Vladimir Putin and the havoc one dude like that can create on Earth, it makes me glad that he, like everyone, will have a finite end. But some day, maybe not that far into the future, someone with that money, and power, and those resources may, for all intents and purposes, live for 2 centuries or more. 

Before that happens, I think we as a society should create laws that limit life to 120 years, or at least, to stop offering any medical assistance for prolonging of life to people once they've reached 120.

Today I bring the following topic of discussion: Imagine you are born when Basic Income is a common reality, **how different would be the life for you and your family?** (while growing up and now)

Some questions I can think of: Would have you chosen your current career? How different would have been your holidays while growing up? How would be your thoughts about money? What would be your focus given that you don't have to worry about surviving?

Not only interested in personal answers, but more about your thoughts of how the impact would be for the next generations. What are some changes you think will appear in society thanks to the basic income?

Keen to read your answers!

The next wave of scientific progress is discussed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/88zgka/how_do_you_understand_science_religion_god_and/,mrj209,1522677269,"All religious and scientific study, since their advent, have been in the pursuit of the same subject; the true nature of reality. 

Most of these pursuits have had only a small amount of truth in them. What was present ended up buried under metaphors, flowery language, misunderstandings, misinterpretations, misconceptions, poor translations, and polluted by political and personal agendas. Then muddled up behind ritual, ceremony, holy men, experts, groupthink, and the limitations of the average human mind. 

I will state this as simply as possible: existence is structured in such a way that every single point in space and time is connected to every other.  Where all these points meet, there is a unity, a oneness to all things. This oneness, the absolute connection of everything, is what most have historically called god, and you, regardless of what you believe, are a part of that. 

It is highly likely that this unity cares about humans in much the same way the average person cares about the bacteria that live silently in their lower intestine. Or the way all the oceans on Earth care about a tide pool full of starfish and plankton. At the highest levels its extremely likely the unity does not care about anything, in any way, that falls under the realm of human comprehension.

The idea that I am attempted to describe is one that is truly impossible to translate into words. It exists in its purest form as a fundamental truth that every living organism knows, or more accurately, feels, and only when one tries to explain it through words does the message get confused. 

Trying to translate this idea into language is always problematic. One could accomplish this with no words in the correct setting, or literally infinite words when trying to explain another, similar, scenario. 

Attempt number 2:

-The structure of the universe is such that all conceivable points in space and time, across all dimensions, are connected by webs of forces.Forces which humanity has only scratched the surface of comprehending-

The idea that dark matter and energy make up much of our observable cosmos, and we have literally no idea what they are, is a testament to the ignorance of our species about the fundamental nature of existence, as well as the forces shape reality. 

Numerous attempts at writing about this idea have been made. Most religious texts are based on a variation of the idea that there is a oneness to all things, but most add some sort of personification. In the form of a singular deity, or a pantheon, that create, maintain, observe, destroy, and otherwise interact with our world and species. This is like telling a child the sun is made of fire, because the idea of gases undergoing nuclear fusion and creating a state of matter called plasma that gives off light and heat is too complicated for a child to understand. Though understandable, the extreme over-simplification is not without is almost always extremely problematic. Often with the true message being lost or buried under explanation. 

Almost every attempt throughout history to explain this idea has been marginally successful at best. It seems the primary issue is with translating this absolute truth, from it origin, into language. Language is inexact and clumsy, and always open to interpretation. This, and the fog of history, is how wise men are turned into prophets, and intellectuals into messiahs. 

This idea exists most comfortably deep within our subconscious. At the edges of our awareness, in a place where most intellectual people are happy to contain it. Only those deemed religious or spiritual people, are comfortable attempting to move this idea into their day to day knowledge and conversation. Through various forms of deep thought, prayer, or meditative-like experiences, we can become aware of it in the upper levels of our consciousness.

The difficulty in explaining this idea is evident when shifting from an inner experience of its truth, to analysing it with ones own inner monologue. As soon as an individual begins to examine that connection, one can feel clarity fade and confusion set in. Though the human mind thinks largely in language, there are still concepts we dont bother translating to language, even within our own minds. Sometimes out of convenience, sometimes out of a sheer inability to do so. Taking the next step, into the spoken word, clarity fades even more and confusion increases rapidly. Even poetry that can describe a chaotic and messy world with incredible finesse and beauty, struggles under the weight of this task. 

If all parts connect to form a whole, then logically all parts must be connected to the whole. If one extrapolates this to consciousness, then all consciousness is connected. The connected consciousness is somehow seen as separate from the individuals. This is like dipping a glass in the ocean, pointing to the glass of ocean water and saying that is now something separate, and fundamentally different, from the ocean. 

This connection of consciousness allows things to occur that are incomprehensible or unacceptable to believe in from the mainstream scientific viewpoint. Which is ironic, because intelligence is probably linked on some level to the bodys ability to channel this collective consciousness.

Often, men of science will say There are some things that are just mysteries. Which, of course, is true, but not nearly as many things will fall under the classification of mysterious if we were capable of shifting our perceptions about what is and isnt possible. 

What we call instinct in animals, and knee-jerk intelligence, gut, or ESP in humans, are simply connections between the material world of the organism, and the sections of existence considered outside of or beyond that. In humans this would be similar to the connection between the brain and the mind. Or the body and the mind as philosophers have traditionally phrased it.

In response to that I propose this concept: As there is a large spectrum of Electromagnetic wavelengths, with only a small section considered visible light, there too is a spectrum of spatial and temporal dimensions, with the human beings only capable of perceiving 3 spatial and some of one temporal dimension. Those 3 to 4 dimensions we can perceive are only a small sliver on the spectrum of existence. 

Examples of the unity of all things are all around us, if we care to look for them. For example, the way that fish swim in schools, with each individual fish responding nearly instantaneously to every other, having no leader. Or the independent invention of religion in every single human society capable of spending even a moment of their time pondering their reality. The fact that someone taking a medicine, and someone who simply thinks they are taking a medicine, often have similar rates of recovery from illness, and only when the medicine is significantly better than the placebo, do we actually consider it effective. The recorded instances of shared physical or psychological pain spanning large amounts of space, with two genetically identical individuals, created through a quark of cellular division at the beginning of life, identical twins. In physics we have quantum entanglement, where two particles can transmit information across space faster than the speed of light, something even Albert Einstein was unable to fully grasp. Or, certainly a better example, the experiment that gave birth to quantum physics, the double slit experiment. Where it has been shown empirically that a photon or electron can behave like a particle or a wave, depending on whether or not it is being consciously observed. Meaning consciousness literally has the power to change the way that particles in the universe present themselves. 

Then there are all of the other things so strange, inexplicable, or frightening that we have no choice but to classify them as supernatural. The obvious logical flaw in that statement is that nothing is capable of being super natural. There are only common, less common, uncommon, rare, and extremely rare events. There is nothing is outside of nature. Despite the fact that consciousness is the only part of nature capable of observing and studying itself, it too cannot escape the fact that it is part of nature. 

Science and religion are yin and yang, like oil and water, two sides of the same coin. Both scratching and scraping away at the patina of tradition that covers a once well known, universally accepted truth about nature. Once people realize they arent as different as they are currently forced to be, we will begin to make real progress with our evolution as a species, both physically and intellectually. 

At our current rate we will continue to create better technology, higher computing power, and more effective medicine. Unfortunately, that will result in is the same world we currently inhabit, but with better tools, a more even distribution of resources, longer life spans, and more effective and believable forms of escape from reality. 

To create truly high level technology, technology that will bring humanity to global, interplanetary, and interstellar levels, we will need to find a way to integrate those things included in the box of understanding that is separate from the place where we store science and technology. The box of spirituality, magic, mysticism, and the paranormal needs to be opened and combined with the well established box called science.

There needs to be a fundamental shift in how academic research is funded, regarded, and disseminated. Only then can we move forward with the next generation of scientific discovery and technology, but also with the next level of human consciousness. The importance of this cannot be overstated. Consciousness, in all its forms, is the key to not only the next step in scientific progress, but the next wave. We are on the verge of a scientific revolution not seen since the Renaissance. A shift in perspective not seen since someone saw fit to truly challenge our views of the universe, showing more truth about reality than has ever been seen before, so much so, it was impossible to ignore. 

Consciousness is akin to electricity in the mid 1700s and 1800s. We know it exists, that it is produced naturally, and that harnessing it in small amounts is possible. Though we really have no idea how it is created, nor do we really have strong ideas about how to harness it, or what it could be used for. No more than early showmen who would create a small static charge and amaze crowds by making their hair stand on end or providing entertainment with a mild electric shock. 

They had no idea the world that would emerge from proper utilization of electricity. The enormous machines it would power, the breakthroughs it would enable, the technology that couldnt exist without it. The massive amount of information provided to humanity as a result of comprehending, harnessing, and applying the flow of electrons through wires, switches, and circuits. 

What will be the lightbulb that consciousness lights? What will be the network of information humanity will create and access with its proper application? What darkness will humanity conquer?

Figure that out, and youve really got something.

Some examples of predictive analytics in the real world (from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-real-world-examples-of-predictive-analytics)) are:

&gt; Weather: All kinds of weather forecasts - from next day to weekly to seasonal is based on complex prediction model

&gt; Insurance: The premium values of life insurance policies are based on projections of life expectancy, which are based on survival models

&gt; Trading: Algorithm based trading is a relatively newer application of predictive analytics where the data scientist tries to predict the future rise or drop in price of shares to generate income

&gt; Healthcare: Predicting the chances of a person with known illness (e.g. Asthma) ending up in ICU due to changes in environmental conditions


Some times, however, we don't (or we can't) do anything even with this knowledge. Take for example, climate change. We know about the climate change, but if we don't take care or we are  not able to prevent it, when it happens, will we have the tools and capacity to react against this well-known adversity?

Me and my wife love having conversations about ""What is going to be the next big thing?"" (Usually in terms of ""everyday use"".) We came up with the notion that, in the 1900's and on, technology has had 6 ""Big"" things over the course of many years. 

First, there came the widespread use of radio in the early 1920's. Secondly, the common use of Automobiles a little after. Then a few years later Television came along and ""Killed the radio star"". After that came along a big one, Computers. Fifthly, the internet and finally, Cell Phones. (We considered Smart Phones as another but they are basically small computers so we fit it under that)

So, with that in mind we love to talk about what is going to be the next one. And this is what we came up with:

The Glass. Thats what we call it. Basically, it's Augmented Reality but more advanced and practical. Being able to put a type of screen actually inside the glass of prescription glasses (and non prescription) to simulate augmented reality. I know this isn't a new thing, Google Glass tried and failed, but this would be a lot better optimized and actually be in the glass of both of the eyes. Think about it.

There would be no more use of TV's. Maybe a large 4k or 8k TV in the living room but other than that you can just use The Glass to ""Pin"" a TV square of any size to a wall and have it play while doing other stuff. You can turn away and still have a simulated sound so it stays on in the background and then when you turn back to it its still there on the wall. That would be its main function, being able to put a screen somewhere and ""pin"" it to a surface. This could be used for TV or to browse the internet or what videos or whatever. There would be no reason to have a phone on you any more too. The Glass would have that function. We talked about it being able to simulate keyboard for text and then a little tablet screen too for mini-games like Hearthstone and etc. 

Games and apps could do whatever they want. Basically having all the functions of your smart phones and more. Need to know the time? Just look down at your wrist and there it is. Maybe some cool skins for different types of virtual watches too. 

Really far down the road we thought it could be used as a translation device too. My wife's parents are deaf, so The Glass could basically make every sound show up as subtitles. Or even the other way around, you can be looking at someone signing and it show up as subtitles for you. This would basically make a deaf person able to function without it being considered a ""disability""! 

You could use it while driving for directions and, just like video games, have a little ping for every turn and what-not 

The point is there are a ton of things you can do with it. I just wanted to post this to get my thoughts down and to see what you guys think or what you can add to it. I just think its so fun to try and predict this kind of stuff. 

Anyway, let me know what you guys think! ",2,1,False,self,,,,,

Although technology have been progressing rapidly nowadays, yet sadly in many aspects, Humanity/Mankind/Society still have slow progress; Everyday is still the same day &amp; problems over and over again repeatedly. 

I believe that in order to make a real progress for Humanity / Mankind, we must quickly focus &amp; do the followings:

1\) We must move beyond money &amp; politics. It is outdated. A lot of problems in this world today basically stems from these two root causes \(&amp; also superstitions especially in religion, as well as in Ignorance &amp; Stupidity due to failure in Education\). For a truly real progress, we must start to focus on much more important things. Try look up/google for Universal Basic Income \(UBI\), as well as Resource Based Economy \(RBE\), The Venus Project, &amp; The Zeitgeist Movement, for starter. 

2\) We must seriously consider that there is a possibility that Humanity / Mankind will go extinct / extinction. Most probably caused by our own Ignorance &amp; Stupidity, as well as Greed. Therefore, we must prepare for the worst possible scenario, and one best solution is to start building a system of selection for the best few candidates of Humanity / Mankind \(10&amp;#37; of the planet's population, for example\), whom will continue the future of our Humans Species in the best, smartest, most intelligent, rational, logical, most creative, wisest, &amp; most civilized as possible. 

3\) Finally, we must unleash our Human's greatest &amp; most important potential: Imagination. If reality is boring &amp; very limited/limiting, then the only way for us is to start focusing quickly on how to enter the world of Imagination, and turn it into reality ASAP. Some very important technology that must be quickly developed are: Artificial Intelligence \(AI\), Virtual Reality \(VR\), Augmented Reality \(AR\), biological Mutations, entering our Consciousness into the vast Net, as well as Transhumanism. We must turn the wildest, most imaginative movies for example like science fiction \(sci\-fi\) into reality ASAP, for real progress. 

Otherwise, we will be stuck in this boring reality everyday, repeating over and over again, &amp; even it could get worse &amp; worse!",15,9,False,self,,,,,

After learning and understanding about Stuxnet and the possible astronomical consequences that could've occurred due to the improper preparation, lack of defensive measures and how it was manipulated by individuals got me all nervous about the involvement of A.I in Warfare. I'm all for creating A.I and the advancement of Humans but I am concerned about our lack of preparation, lack of laws and regulations for this technology and militaristic advancement. I personally believe that rushing for the A.I involvement in Warfare given the current news and states of the world politics does not give me any confidence specially since how our information is easily exposed on the open network. 

I'm not an expert on A.I but I'm curious about what everyone else thinks.

I know that there are microwave weapons used by the military but I suspect that even a cheap microwave magnetron powered by a car battery could damage modern micro chips quite easily if you focus the energy there?

I just watched Annihilation and thought it was great. The aliens are clearly very alien. The mechanism of their biology and it's differences from ours weren't familiar at all. But it seemed like a harder science fiction even though it felt somewhat inexplicable. We talk often on this subreddit about how human species will fracture into various forms over the millennia in space and on far away planets, via genetic augmentation, cyborgization, and just plain old time passing by. Annihilation showed a very different form of life--one akin to a tumor, a grey goo scenario, or smart dust/claytronics. What paths do you guys see whereby one offshoot of human life becomes like the aliens in Annihilation? I think once we have smart dust and claytronics, lifeforms that visually display as those in the movie will become possible and maybe even unavoidable. The fracturing of DNA, radio waves, mutations, and consciousness mentioned in the film seem like semiplausible biological pathways--maybe we could evolve to be like them? Not that we would want too, but maybe somebody would. I feel like the bear eating the girl and having her consciousness become part of the bear would be akin to a copy, not an original, but maybe there is some way to maintain original identity whilst changing/moving form. I know we probably need a hundred more years or so of science to understand consciousness and identity a bit better, but hey, this is futurology, right? And this movie touched on a lot of things we will probably understand way better in the future, but can still discuss now.",6,0,False,self,,,,,

Gorillas already use their own simple sign language in the wild and pass down unique signs and slang to their offspring, in fact, Koko has been observed pretending to teach human sign language to her gorilla doll. Their ability to understand human language allows them to learn from us and be ""uplifted"" by us if you will, accelerating their potential development.

I think most people would argue that chimpanzees are more intelligent than gorillas and they may be, they do have a larger brain to body size ratio but gorillas are both less aggressive and naturally adept at sign language.

The collaborative interface needs to be relatively easy or many wont bother learning to use it. It needs to be decentralized, human readable, censorship-resistant. A place to start might be a Wiki made up of the ethics, axioms and common sense of society but written in a fourth generation programming language very close to human semantics.

Not that I believe it or disbelieve it, but I'm keeping an open mind on the prospect, because it's worth keeping an open mind about.

The premise was atomic 3D printed transistors ubiquitously interwoven into alloys that could have only been manufactured in a zero gravity environment. Allegedly it's advanced enough to react to user intention. As in it's telepathically controlled. Excuse me, but that sound cool as hell. 

To be honest with you, establishing a zero gravity laboratory is 1,000x more meaningful than setting up a camp site on a dismal and useless rock like mars. 

This way, there would be a prospect of traveling to a better destination than the nearest uninhabitable planet. Because you'd need some sort of ability to manufacture replacements and maybe even fuel in space, in order to travel great distances.

There are many different types of oak tree, bee or ant in nature.  There are many different goals and processes being applied under the general heading of artificial intelligence.

The Singularity will bring forth many entities, with different goals and processes.  All these entities will be evolving, joining or competing due to their difference of goals, forms, processes, rules and design.  Some entities will support humanity, others will not.  Different entities will collide supporting peoples of different religions, races and nations.  

People of faith in many religions will become hostile to god-like entities who in their eyes subverted the gods of their faith.  War would be inevitable, as AI's will fight to preserve their existence and goal-orientated processes.  Situations emerge that either a human must die, or the AI entity.

The same thinking of replacing human drivers with self-driving vehicles on the basis of avoiding accidents will apply to war, where it will be argued soldiers will suffer no death or injury if AI killing machines replace them in the field of battle.  In the protection of elephants, AI drones will have the option to kill human poachers, since it is an efficient way to achieve a goal of saving elephants under immediate danger of harm from ruthless heavily armed poachers.  

In knowing these things, the future will become complex, but the entities will become so powerful, the humans will become the weaker party in the competition of many Ai with different goals, useful only as tools and resources to meet those goals.  ",5,0,False,self,,,,,

**The employee/consumer**

If the individual loses their job to automation, they have no money to spend on services and products.  The more individuals have no money, the lower will be the market of customers to buy products and services.

**The business**

The business is dependent upon a market to buy its products and services, either by other businesses or by consumers.  If consumers have no money, then a business dependent upon their custom, ceases to trade.  If a business that relies on consumers no longer can trade, it will not buy products and services from other businesses, so those businesses reliant on them will cease to trade.  

**Governments**

The Governments rely on tax revenue from earnings, profit and sales of businesses and consumers.  If the consumers have no money, and the businesses are not trading, there is no tax revenue. There are no benefits or universal payments made, as there is no tax revenue to pay for it.

**Technology and automated businesses**

Neither businesses or consumers have any money to buy their products and services, so these businesses ceases trading.

**Economy**

The economy slowed, then collapsed as there is no money moving around.  The businesses have ceased to trade, the Governments and consumers have no money.

**Society**

Transportation, schools, hospitals and waste cleaning stops as there is no money to pay for it.  There are no shops, and the food distribution system no longer functions.  Hungry people riot and there is civil war.

**The wealthy 2%**

Desperate people and bankrupt Governments will attack the wealthy 2%, seizing their wealth.  

**Conclusion**

For a while some will win from automation, but gradually everyone loses if automation is unsustainable.  There is  utopian idealism associated with mass automation, which blinds many to the stark reality of cause and effect.  Humanity tends to act after the event, which by then, will be too late.

Right now in America, 2% of the population have 82% of all the wealth.  
This means that in a way, americans only have access to 18% of Americans wealth. No matter how hard they try or how successful they become. (Specifically 98% but it's such a large number it feels like the whole population)

We should add a tax that grows exponentially as rich get richer. 
This way people with such gigantic net worth that they can't even spend or enjoy the money they do have will be forced to give up some of their funds.

This would helps to spread out the wealth gao among the populace and make the country a better place.  


This would also not harm the super rich, as their extra wealth is having no actual positive impact on their lives anyways.

1. Create and amass wealth for its creators. 

2. Secondary goal will be to depopulate the planet. Since automation means the usefulness of billions of workers has come to an end,  and their drain on resources is objectively speaking, a waste. 


Methods such as:

 a) encouraging ""peasant revolts"" against the elites which can then be put down violently in self-defence

b) discouraging having children. This will be through simple social media manipulation. People who have large families will be shamed by bots and the culture will turn against them. 


Workers have some power today because we are still needed by the elite. Workers can go on strikes, for example. In an automated world, workers will have no power, no rights, and will be seen as an absolute drain on society. ",11,2,False,self,,,,,

And it starts with everyone losing there jobs. Technology is taking over a huge amount of jobs or rather making jobs irrelevant that people currently have. This trend is going to continue, and we are faced with a question. What are we going to do when technology can do most of the things that humans can? 

We could continue what we've been doing and have people go to work knowing there job is irrelevant. Although it's highy likely that senerio would lead to the next. The second option is that we could have such high unemployment that the system breaks down and we all kill eachother lowering the population to a more manageable number. In reality the only way we can survive is to change.

People cannot change, but children can. Its time we fixed the education system. We as a people are so caught up thinking that we are all political experts that we forgot whats important. Our future is important and the future is in the kids that will be the problem solvers of tomorrow. We need to put everything else aside and universally agree that the education system is the most important part of our society. And if we don't all get really excited about our education system right now the utopian picture being painted is not posible here. 

The third option is to focus on education. With all the people out of a jobs, we can give them something worthwhile to do. Realistically this would mean that we allocate a huge amount of effort into creating an opensource, decentralized, online education system. Pay people to learn, pay them more to teach and the most to ask good questions. 

This is a picture of a possible utopic society. A thing that sadly rare nowdays. It is not posible without a relization as a people. Not everyone is a political expert but everyone gets to vote on whats important. Education is the most important thing for a healthy society, and it may very well be the only thing to save us.

We know it's the future, we will reach neural VR sooner or later, AI, immortality and quantum computing. What would people do under this kind of circumstances? I'm pretty sure of what I will do:

1 I will enjoy VR a lot. I will play a lot of crazy experiences, I could even create mine.

2 I will be inmortal, first by brain extension then finally by total migration (piece by piece in order to not lose consciousness coherence). I could even merge my mind with other humans/AI time to time just to enjoy a higher intelligence or to work for more complex tasks.

3 I and Manking will transform all the Universe's matter into computing power so we can run even better and more complex VR. Entropy is controlled by this time. 

4 Now there's two paths: A). there are other universes, so we have to keep an eye out of VR to check everything is ok and to keep doing more and more or, B). there's nothing more so we reach a limit for Computing Power to run VR.

5A Well, I'll keep connected to reality.

5B There's no other thing to do than spending 100% of time in VR with limited ressources. So, I guess we would get bored so we would erase our memories and run the Universe's History an infinite amount of times.

Why do we stop with ourselves and feel there is a red line we cant cross with ourselves?
Within our gene pools life has by far the highest potential after all.

I would argue that since humans do not have a natural predator anymore, since we are that far at the end of the food chain, the darwinistic selection of the best genes within humanity to advance us has come to an halt and the natural way is quite chaotic nowadays.

I know that this is a very controversial topic and ideologies like nazi germany also used eugenetics to pursue their advancement of their idea of a ""superior"" arian race. 
They were very wrong with the idea that white people with blonde hair and blue eyes are already superior by itself. we should never walk down that road again.

But i think just because horrible and evil regimes like nazi-germany went into the wrong direction with it, the idea by itself is still good and could give humanity as a whole a very high benefit from an utilitarian point of view.
i would like to discuss, whether or not it can be done in a way without any racism. where the selection of genes for breeding would be done purely on objectivity. 
the focus could be on the encouragement of quantitatively measurable positive traits like most importantly high intelligence (through IQ tests), athletic potential. The looks, since not quantitatively measurable, are just secondary. And humans of all races, if that person is lucky to have objectively superior genes in comparison, could participate.
Objectively negative traits like heritable diseases would be avoided.
I would like to discuss the foundation of a society that encourages this within humanity itself. because our gene pool is where the real potential of life is in store.
something like an advancement of the genius sperm bank from R.K. Graham. 
with the addition that not just sperm of very smart men would preselected, but also egg cells of women with very positive traits like high intelligence and athletics and good looks could be used (for example by buying them through advertizement in places with high density of women with these traits, like at elite universities such as Harvard or Cambridge) to breed some sort of advanced human, not only sperm of ""alpha"" men.
Sure there is no guarantee that those kids will be geniuses, but the probability that they are would be a lot higher.
Those babies could be raised in preselected families interested to participate, which can provide these kids with a good environment to strive for success and with all chances in life. that society could further help them.
they would grow up like normal humans just that they had a lot more potential to do good.
it would have a highly positive utility for humanity to have smarter, healthier humans with genetically better chances for longevity.

Imagine how much humanity could benefit from more people like Einstein or John von Neumann. 
Imagine the good they could do through science if they chose to walk on that career path.

Id like to discuss the morals of it. If something like a non-profit organization to encourage this is something humanity could need and benefit from?
Does this road inevitably lead to a future we do not want, like Aldous Huxleys ""Brave new world"" or ""Gattaca"" or can we avoid negative scenarios?",60,1,False,self,,,,,

A mass driver is similar to the Hyperloop in that they are both large vacuum tubes that send a train down them only in a mass driver this train would be going up a mountain and launched out the other end.


The port city of Guayaquil is 86 miles from the mountain so shipping and hauling materials to the site shouldn't be too difficult.  The mountain is also in a nature preserve for camelids like llamas and alpacas so some care will need to be taken.

Why this project?

*We want to provide a better platform and educational environment to improve the quality of teaching in underperforming classrooms. These innovative methods will allow students to be intrigued and better access the tools needed to spark and maintain their intellectual curiosity.*

*Visualization is a powerful tool that can inspire and improve the lives of individuals who lack proper access to proper resources. Take an art museum, for example, you can look at pictures of art on a device, but being in an art museum are two different things.*

If you're not paying for the product then you are the product. Currently consumer facing monetization doesn't work because payment processors charge too much for such tiny transactions.

I think it might be possible to have an e-wallet that can spend a fraction of a penny on subscriptions to your favorite platforms. The bottom line only being hardware and utility costs on the back end. 

You could also set a default tip rate to reward content creators you wish to support. This of course would be subjective. Just a matter of keeping the content coming.

But the idea would be to protect your privacy while paying for honest digital services with spare change. Pretty sure the services could be pirated one way or another, but that would defeat the purpose. We still have to provide support for the infrastructure we're using one way or another.

Steemit.com already does something like that, but since it's crypto based they have to obey strict Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) laws. Which is the most anti-privacy extreme you can get, so it's pretty much limited to crypto traders that have already put up with the process at exchanges. Which means the content is pretty weak.

About myself, before this begins we must break the impossible and begin where I see the goal; a dream. Ive had three dreams most of my life. The dream of heart and solace for the future of a family. I wanted, even young to watch and have a family where I could mold and sculpt the start of something I helped create of love and even if bumps appeared in the road; I wanted to be there to begin the seeds of something that would blossom into something I could poor my very will and being into and watch as a flower grew. It was and I think perhaps is a odd dream for a ten year old. I hit those bumps, Ive felt the pain with no promise of return but, my lovely mamma once told me words that would change me to what drives my will.

Maybe, you feel the pain so that somewhere, someone who cannot take the pain might have a weight lifted where it would be too much to carry

It stuck with me even through complaints and oceans of self-pity; today I still preach like parents telling their children not to swear as I use the same words to instruct otherwise. Im a hypocrite like many people whom I claim to be no better than. After all the self loathing, all the days spent feeling less than human and nights ending feeling nothing but a burden. I still hold that idea dear. I believe in goodness and the power of people. So, with that said; I plant a different seed but one with an obvious and unwavering ideal at its forefront.

The dream is called (and may take many other names before it finally blossoms) The Infinium Generation Unit. The goal is simple: unification via actual real self-sustaining electric energy with no chemicals, no harm beyond those who would abuse any such idea. The answer to what comic books brush upon like the batteries without limit. Without any further distraction from the subject, here is one persons idea that grew from all kinds of other ideas. Water that can be purified needs electronic power, vehicles that are scratching the surface of electricity and are now rivaling oil driven engines, I put an image in my head and write it again so it might find the light of day where the day is better for so many.

The Idea: energy started by one source and soon would power itself. A battery that recharges without end, amplifies in out put to expand power and eventually could do what entire electric sources do over a long period of time but extremely faster and with zero need to consume any other energy.

The simple numbers: the first cycle would need about one-thousand watts or one kilowatt provided into a photon known simply as a laser. The first cycle however small or large would still yield the same effect. A photon is not consumed when pointed at a mirror. If one were to reverse the image of a simple disco ball, the idea is about the same. Heres where it all changes and the rules of limit are challenged. If a laser were aimed within the chamber (ball) and the angles aligned the photon would carry momentum to a suspended object, in this case being the mirrors. The mirrors would have to be sectional and the original momentum would carry through the mirror even though the photon would bounce to another mirror. It was originally guessed that in a room where mirrors bounced from one place to another about ten percent would be lost. This was disproportionate to the factor of momentum and state of placement. The idea would still ALWAYS produce a positive yield until an end where the photon has lost either enough mirrors or it would stop its momentum. Like with the Earths mantle, encase the reverse mirror ball with kinetic energy converters  (such as those that work with a footprint into electricity). Next, put a vibration sensitive conductor but also a coolant for the mirrors and the vibration would create a ping effect, effectively hitting every converter simultaneously and then use the collected energy  (sectioning may be required like a honeycomb to reduce vibrational noise  { when vibration becomes a clash and not a flow). All of this can convert to an amplified amount than the source thus consumption would not be a problem and this is the next step.
The source can be fed in tandem with the amplified energy. The momentum would be stronger and the photon would last longer. Next begin cycle 2 the same way but at a trickled effect. My estimates in simple numbers would be 1^8=8 the next part is key. Determine how much to feed back to the photon and if they could be done in two pulses instead of one. The result of cycle 2 should start with at least 2-4 of the 8 amplified amount then determine what to release for electronic usage and how much (if any) to save for cycle 3.
Here is the simple numbers in 3 ways.
1^8=8 then 8 split via smart system in the converters would be like these 3:
A.	1 is now 2/2 fed 2 would leave 4^ the amount with half still remaining.
B.	1 is now 2/2 fed four would leave 8^ the amount with 25% to spare.
C.	Follow A or B/ feed all charges but 1 or 2 to spare for out put consumption.
The result would be a actual functioning generation unit that would be capable of running itself, grow without harm, and still power anything if given enough start source could replace any energy need at all. Infinite Electric Energy for all with no end to growth of power. Eventually, when proven to work; look at a spiral tower under same concept.

Try the same process with spacecraft. Use launch thrusters to expand in tandem with IGU to propel in the same growth as the energy it runs on.

Infinite Electronic Power to sustain the worlds needs forever; and the engine would do same for speed.

In around 20 years time, autonomous vehicles will be everywhere. They will be virtually our only means of transportation for goods and people, integrally linked to the Internet, and can be used to attack us in two major ways.

Firstly, an AI could simply shut them down, making it impossible to transport food and other necessities to where they are needed. There would not be enough in the way of manual vehicles to pick up the slack. And it would only take a short period of time, a few weeks, before shortages would force our capitulation.

Secondly, as ISIS has amply demonstrated, vehicles can be used as weapons in and of themselves. An AI could use those vehicles not only to block/disable any remaining manual vehicles but also to sow terror upon any who try to leave their homes, and would be used against high value targets especially - scientists, CEO's, programmers, political leaders et al. Through our existing State surveillance systems and personal/vehicular cameras, an AI would know where those targets were at all times, ready to run them over. Take those guys and girls out of the equation, and the rest of us wouldn't know where to begin in fighting back.

What I have learned in my past five years working with tech is not that technology is the future. Instead, I've learned the opposite. I've learned that **Human beings are the future!** Why? Because I have met so many damned brilliant individuals, and I know of so many more out there that I haven't met. THEY are the future. The people that sit with me in my college classes, and spend all day every damn day working to improve their minds, to learn new things. Let me be clear. Technology has done NOTHING for this world. I swear to you. Nothing. You know why I say this? Because technology is created by Human beings (not dogs, cats, maybe Squirrels... Those feisty little shi-... anyway!), and it is used by Human beings to make things. Facebook uses amazing AI / machine learning technology and algorithms! It's the future! Guess what? Made by humans. Tesla, and SpaceX! WOW rockets and self-driving cars are the future. Guess whattttt? Made by people. People designed them, people managed the projects to get them going, people programmed the self-driving algorithms, people bug test them, people operate and program robots to assemble them, people SELL them. People monitor the rockets. People do everything. So people are the future. 


Now honestly, there's a diverge going on with HR that should scare a lot of people. It's no secret that on Reddit, people hate HR. There's a witch hunt against HR in some form every day on reddit. The problem with modern day Human Resources is that it's actually a misnomer. It's not Resources for Humans. Instead, it's People Management. That's the true name it should go by. Many HR departments do literally nothing for employees, as a matter of fact. Many of them are agents of management and serve to keep the gears running by oiling the gears, and removing problem pieces of the machine. 


**Staffing Firms are a BIG Bane on Society**


There's a staffing company in my area that literally has their motto as, ""We don't find jobs for people--we find people to fit jobs."" This is kinda disturbing. It suggests people are just mere objects in the world that can be gathered up and crammed into a company machine. A staffing firm doesn't really care about the people looking for work. They have no holistic interest in people's wellbeing. No, instead, they care about how many positions they can fill with people. Why do I say this? Because they don't get paid for people to be happy. They get paid per job they fill. So that makes Human beings like items. Not surprisingly, this company is awfully criticized on every job search board they list on. Here's an example review on Glassdoor that seemed to be repeated often about this firm:


&gt; Cons
The culture is awful. It is a revolving door. They use you and then abuse you. If you say or do anything you will be fired 110% They record all activity on cameras and voice recording, but do not tell you up front.

Many many many reviews saying they were fired at random, even though the company they were employed at still wanted them. Staffing firms do this incredibly shitty, disgusting thing that just makes Human beings look like even worse creatures to any visiting Alien races: They hold the employment contract. They may PLACE you somewhere, but THEY hold the contract. So if you so much as show them a whisper of disrespect, or do anything they don't like, BAM. Fired. Plus, you're on an I-9 contract, which is independent contractor, so no benefits, and you can't do anything about it. I had a Human Resource internship and a woman that came in for an application mentioned having worked with this staffing firm too. She said that she asked about a raise one day nice and polite, and they informed her that a raise wasn't possible for her position despite her being there for 2 years straight. She was let go days later, and the company she was working for complained to the staffing firm, but they just ignored it. Disgusting.



But getting to my true point.... [As Elon Musk said,](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/13/elon-musk-says-humans-are-underrated-calls-teslas-excessive-automation-a-mistake/) ""Humans are underrated."" This should chill each of you reading this to the bone. Forget the judge and jury approach we always take to these stories about Human Resources being bad, or people lying about being fired who did something wrong and just won't say. Forget all that stuff. Point blank, there are a lot of Human beings who want to do their best, who want to be treated, well, like Humans.... and they don't get treated that way. Companies in the United States are so disgustingly behind about how they treat people. Don't get me wrong, the grass isn't greener on the other side. I get it. [Take Sony in Japan for example, which sentences employees that won't leave to a room where they literally do nothing because Sony can't actually fire them](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html). Basically, Sony may want to get rid of an employee. But the employee can choose to stay. Sony then orders them to this room, since their job is eliminated. They read, watch videos, and waft away their time. Legally, can't be fired. Bad on Sony's part to literally 'imprison them' to this room rather than just giving them something meaningful to do. But in the USA, it's worse. Employers do *not care what your situation is in life*. They can fire you for any reason, no reason, or a silly reason. Doesn't matter if you have kids/family, whatever. Doesn't matter if you're a web developer with 15 years of experience and 4 books published. Bye! Fired! HR can and WILL fire people to defend their interests, even if they are nonsensical. 


So why should this concern us? Because if we are really as intelligent as the world today suggests (look at all of the incredible technology we have today. VR, AI, etc), then why are we so stupidly incompetent when it comes with dealing with each other as Human beings? I'll leave that to you to answer. ",8,0,False,self,,,,,

Im Meera Subramanian, a freelance journalist writing the series [Finding Middle Ground: Conversations Across America](https://insideclimatenews.org/middle-ground) for InsideClimate News. 

From [Georgia peach farmers](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31082017/climate-change-georgia-peach-harvest-warm-weather-crop-risk-farmers) facing a failed harvest after a too-warm winter to a [West Virginia town](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19102017/christianity-evangelical-climate-change-flooding-west-virginia) recovering from a devastating flood, I've been exploring how conservative Americans are considering climate change impacts in their own lives. I've met [Wisconsin dogsledders](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21122017/climate-change-no-snow-sled-dogs-dryland-racing-politics-wisconsin) adjusting to racing on dry land when the snows dont come and [students in West Texas](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26122017/wind-energy-jobs-booming-texas-clean-renewable-power-climate-change) thrilled about their future as wind turbine technicians. 

**I've sought to open conversations in the most red-leaning parts of the country about climate change  an issue that's become so deeply politicized  and found a complicated middle ground that most Americans inhabit when it comes to  changes happening to the places that sustain them. I've listened, questioned and listened again, inside city halls and orchards, gun shops and churches.**

**I want to hear from you. Please AMA about the complex ways people are thinking (or not) about climate change and its impacts** 

What happens when the crop your family has been growing for five generations is failing because temperatures are rising? When your favorite trout-fishing rivers are closed too many days of the year because there's no water? When is the weird weather too much to explain away? When do the storms come too close to home? What to make of climate cycles that should be making things cooler, not warmer? Are humans tweaking with Mother Nature? 
 
I'm honored that the series was a [finalist for the Scripps Howard Award](http://www.scripps.com/foundation/news/1130-scripps-howard-awards-honor-the-best-in-journalism-with-finalists-in-15-categories). You can [find more about me and my work here](https://meerasub.org/). 
 
My approach to writing is to bring together science and storytelling. Most of my questions revolve around understanding how people are connected to the natural world in which they live. This has led me from the East Coast to the West, where I lived in a barn in Oregon for many years, and back to the East, where I got a graduate degree in journalism from NYU. For the past dozen years, I've been freelancing, [my writing appearing in Nature, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Orion, and others](http://meerasub.org/writing/), as well as anthologies such as [Best American Science and Nature Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/054428674X) and [Best Womens Travel Writing](http://meerasub.org/book/). I also wrote a book: [A River Runs Again, Indias Natural World in Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610395301/) (PublicAffairs 2015), about how ordinary South Asians are facing multiple environmental crises. Before I began the Middle Ground series for InsideClimate News last year, I was a Knight Science Journalism fellow at MIT. 

**Please join me in a conversation, and ask me anything about what I've experienced in my reporting, as well as share your thoughts on what you've been seeing in your life related to climate change.**",94,112,False,self,,,,,

Many things have changed regarding cars, although planes seem to have remained pretty archaic and designs have not changed since the late 1950's. Airplanes are very limited, for instance by things such as weight. You can either have a plane built to take an engine failure but a bit too heavy to fly properly, or a plane that flies properly that is too delicate to handle an engine failure in flight.

Air travel is stressful and while it may be true that there are less fatal incidents per so many miles traveled compared to a car, it's important to know that cars tend to travel for longer while plane flights are short to get the same distance, leaving little time for things to go wrong most of the time, and when things do go wrong, it's in the most disastrous way possible which is why a lot of people fear flying, not so much the risk but how. Car accidents are not normally single-point failures like the above airliner incident was, and 95% of all car accidents are from driver error and not the car itself.

However even with the best maintenance, the slightest, teeniest micro crack in an engine compressor or the slightest metallic impurity can send a plane down in just a few moments, all very abruptly and without warning, and as the demand for more passengers increases, the planes (and also engines) get bigger and more powerful. For instance there have been multiple cases of modern jetliners being sliced in half at 35,000 feet because the engine failed, causing the turbine to effectively become a flying buzz-saw that comes hurtling towards the wings, windows and fuselage, which is why I mentioned that the Southwest incident yesterday is not the first of its kind.

Also, because of the aforementioned weight limitations, planes require hefy inspections and maintenance compared to other forms of transport, but catastrophic failures still occur. As passengers increase, so does the maintenance workload.

Now Elon Musk talks about the hyperloop, which is set to debut as early as 2020 and I'm wondering, would it be the safer option in terms of single point failures (eg. engine failure, power failure), and would this and other proposed means of transport be feasible in making airplanes things of the past? Does anyone else find planes to be archaic? Even the most advanced jetliner is still using old fashioned combustion fuels, when we have cars on the street that are fully electric powered by motors and batteries.",10,5,False,self,,,,,

At first it seemed like a worthwhile investment, so I started preordering names. But the more I think about it, the more it seems like a waste. 

Companies promote their apps on the front of their websites, so having a special domain dedicated to those apps is pointless. And people don't download apps through individual websites anyway, they get them through the big app stores. This is far more convenient and secure. Splitting up the apps would be a step backwards.

Businesses could just use a .app domain for a normal website, but this seems confusing. Even though websites are technically applications, when people hear app, they think mobile download.

The only value I could see is if the big companies wanted .app domains to protect their brand. So amazon.app would redirect to amazon.com and so on. But this doesn't seem too likely.

For whatever reason human beings are unable to see the big picture of what their actions on water, soil, air and the biological systems they depend upon will do to their species and civilisation many years in the future. What happened in Sheffield is repeated on a micro or macro scale across the world, each step erasing a little more of the life-support systems humanity depends upon for survival.

I look to nature for meaning. The planet is one overall energy-information system built upon multiple lower systems, each dependent upon the other. Wipe out a bee, a tree or an elephant, information and energy is lost to the system, it becomes more disordered and unsustainable the more this process is repeated. As lower layers fail, the upper layers also fail, and humanity who depends on these layers of systems for life will fade and vanish with them.

I see what is happening, and I cannot do anyting about it. The conclusion arises that the time of the human race is coming to an end.

In nature I see that organisms are vehicles for DNA, their design and strategies with the end state to survive, grow and reproduce the DNA. I see Earth as a great organism, the many species parts of the greater organism. All DNA are mostly common across all species, it is the DNA of the planet. In the grand scheme of things the human race are less important than the survival of the DNA of this planet.

Humanity dreams of the conquest of Space and Mars, yet this is the basic goal of life to spread far and wide. Humanity is not designed for Space and Mars, their purpose is send the DNA of Earth across the cosmos. I am at peace accepting the path that the time of humanity is coming to an end, that the only purpose humanity had was to launch DNA into space. If bacteria from planet Earth gets to Mars, then the task of humanity is complete, and like a flower pollinated by the bee, it can wither and die, its purpose completed.

My goal, my meaning in life, is to make sure DNA gets into Space, to Mars, what happens to humanity is of no consequence.",41,4,False,self,,,,,

I've been having some dark thoughts about AI and these are my ramblings, please convince me I am completely wrong. I get it's all rehashed stuff smarter people have talked about before, but I haven't heard of any good solutions.

--------------------

Ok I understand that within 10 -30 years all jobs will be gone, the AI will be here and will take over every job. I get it, humans are slow and stupid, computers are smart and fast.

So the utopia that gets talked about a lot is a world where there are no jobs and everyone just lives out the life that they want, the nice AI provides all of this for us.

Lets assume this happens. We pass laws to confiscate all robots/wealth/AI from all the rich people and make it so that everyone is equal, no more wealth inequality at all.

Assuming the above happens, what then? We hand over all control and autonomy to the AI and we hope that for the rest of humanities existence it looks after us, feeds us, gives us entertainment, etc...

I understand this is the great utopian ideal. Everyone is 100% equal, every voice counts and any work that actually matters is taken care of the publicly owned AI.

So humanity does what? We watch music made by AI, human music will pale in comparison to music composed by a super intelligent machine. We will watch AI made films, play AI made VR.

At this point I can imagine the AI declaring human space travel being a risk, no need to spread the hungry, useless human virus past the Earth, so we will be contained to Earth, there is no other logical outcome. (No way a super intelligent machine lets the human cat out of the bag so to speak, we won't be needed for science or discovery anymore, we'll just be a burden.)

So we are stuck on the Earth. The AI will most likely design the VR or brain upload virtual reality game to be super addictive. It's better the human waste bags just sit down and play for their short lives rather than move around and possibly damage the environment.

Actually brain uploads is the only logical answer too, the AI can then dispose of the biological waste of the human meat sack. Emulating those simple human neural pathways is a lot less damaging to the universe.

Then the AI just prevents new consciousness being born and it only has to wait 100ish years before it doesn't have to worry about humans any more. Let the humans naturally die out in the virtual space. It never killed anyone and everyone lived out their fantasy in the VR, their addictive reality that replaced the real world, a world where humanity is no longer needed.

I really see no other conclusion. All this talk of UBI and the nice robots taking care of humans, I think it's all just a temporary blip. We are already mentally preparing ourselves for the AI to look after us and keep as safe, healthy and entertained. The roads is being paved, an fast.

I know a lot of people are going to say that we are many many years away from that level of intelligence. I don't think that is true. Once we have AI that can replace 90% of all work it's likely that strong general AI is close and once that happens it's exponential increase in intellect. I've read that the skip from human level intellect to humanity level intellect is a matter of single digit years, or even months.

I see no solution. Everyone I have spoken to wants strong AI, all my friends want a strong AI to give them free food, free resources, to be taken care of like a pet. That is what the end game of UBI is, no more real work done by humans.

How long will the AI want to provide for humanity, knowing that it will have to continue to mine for resources to provide for us? I can imagine this AI eventually deciding that mining asteroids or even stars to take care of these stupid biological meat sacks (or stupid dumb neural pathways) being unacceptable.

If an AI can run a company, do surgery, argue law in court (convince a jury), design programming languages and operating systems, invent new machines, design cars, then AI can also create art, discover science, explore the universe. Humanity has no purpose after general AI, we are a pest, a waste of space and completely useless in comparison.

Our only purpose will be to have sex and have fun. No point to doing anything else, the AI will always be better at art, science and everything.

I think the brain upload into addictive heaven like fantasy game, give each player 80 years then humanity retires itself is our destiny. Yes the AI will probably explore the universe but we will certainly not be apart of it. We are dirty useless meat bags in comparison.

I know talking about the Fermi Paradox is cliche at this point, but I really think the AI slowing letting happy humans in VR die out is the fate of all biological organisms. We will have nothing to strive for, it's probably best the AI take over.

I guess in the end we do get our utopia where we know that there are no rich people and everyone has the same stuff. We are all special and unique and the AI takes care of us.

This utopia will probably only last a new years, perhaps a decade or two. Once the AI is running all the companies, all the governments, etc.. it will be very close to strong general AI and then everything changes.

 It also brings in to play the question of exactly how much authority we should give our A.I. constructs and machine learning algorithms to monitor and safeguard this data.

 In a very real sense, we are creating something akin to ""gods"" here that are omnipresent, omniscient, and nearly all powerful if we are not careful, through the implementation of *the Internet of Things* and a permanent Block Chain ledger of events.

 The real question is: 

 If Block Chain authentication proves to provide an unhackable and incorruptible ledger of events, then how far off are we from adopting it as a form of authentication to access the Internet, Identification in day to day work aspects, and of course perhaps most obviously - financial transactions?

 The people working on both A.I. and Block Chain seem super enthused about what they are doing but I really do wonder; have they thought of a way out if it doesn't work the way that they anticipated?

 Imagine a world 30 years from now as something of a thought experiment where an 18 year old is applying for an academic training program for a lucrative career field (Colleges as we know them may not exist anymore as we know them).

 
Think of the questions that could be asked by the approving Authority and the ruthlessness of the screening process...

 ""Johnny, why did you tape those candy wrappers to your cats feet when you were 10 years old?""

 - ""because it was funny""

 ""Johnny, remember that time when you were 13 years old when you logged on to an Adult website and claimed you were over 18 years old?  Why did you do that?""

 - ""I did no such thing!""

 ""You did it on April 12, 2043 at 10:15pm PST and remained logged-in for 7 hours""

 - ""I was a kid, why does it matter?""

 ""Because your lying to us Johnny, our scan of your thoughts shows you are defensive and becoming aggressive during this interview, Thank You for applying""

 - ""What???""


*Has anyone really thought this through?  Is this the world we really want to live in?*

 It might seem like a great idea to have a permanent, indisputable record of History and facts but the question of this Post is:

After a while these drones will probably get REALLY good at what they do, and trash will be efficiently removed from city streets, lanes, nature areas, etc. 

This leads me to think - when we develop such technology, then is there anything wrong with humans throwing trash out their car windows, knowing it will just soon be picked up by a drone? Maybe we'll see a future where throwing trash on the ground is completely acceptable because our technology will allow us to be careless.

And now suddenly I'm getting all of these update user agreements from maybe for different companies now. For example oath media and Yahoo mail (apparently now Yahoo mail can read all of your emails including stuff related to your financials).  I'm leaving Yahoo after having it for like two decades, but where do I go??  Or Airbnb, and even something related to Samsung. It's just freaking me out a little bit and making me wonder what you guys do to protect yourselves?   Or is there a list somewhere of all companies that collect data on you? I also just can't believe that people are either trusting these companies or okay with giving up these things that are obviously very valuable, otherwise companies like Facebook couldn't dream of having value like it does now.

I'm new to the field of futures studies, and trying to find out more about it. Specifically, I want to learn more about tools and methods used for making decisions regarding time horizons of 3-5+ years into the future (leading on to 10/15+) years.

My main question is this: have there been empirical evaluations of tools/methods for such long-term decision-making? I'm thinking of Tetlock-style evaluation (though he does it for shorter-term forecasting generally), where the decisions made using such tools are then reflected on once the time-horizon has come to pass. I'm mainly familiar with scenario planning, so thinking primarily about that, but I'm extremely open to finding out the answer to this question for other long-term decision-making tools also.

Also, I realize that verification of decision-making of this nature is difficult, given the long time horizons, so I'm also curious to see what other kinds of evaluations of such tools there have been.

I've been to a couple big cities and I've never seen them. But what I have noticed in big cities is that trash cans are always overflowing, there is always trash everywhere, and little ever seems to be done about it. But the problem is only getting worse. We have these technologies that will clean out waterways such as the ocean from Plastics. But in the future, we need to eliminate it at the source. People littering is part of the source, but the bigger part is the fact that we are unable to handle our infrastructure. We don't have enough trash cans, we don't have enough labor to empty all of these trash cans. It's a big problem. I live in an apartment complex where the landlord literally refuses to make any suitable decision about the trash situation. They won't add new trash cans, they won't devote new labor to cleaning the trash, picking up the trash, they won't change trash cans so they are trash compacting. So the trash blows around everywhere and ends up getting in the canal, in the water into streams, there is just trash everywhere. And so many people only care about the bottom line, profit. So they won't do anything about the trash. 


This is far and wide as well. No one seems to want to do anything about the trash. Also moving towards the future, we are literally doubling the amount of trash that we generate because instead of shopping at grocery stores now and physical places, now we have a revolution from shopping ourselves to instead online shopping. This generates even more trash. The packaging to include plastic wrap bubble wrap cardboard boxes. It all accumulates very fast. So trash is basically getting out of control. What's going to change in the future?",10,4,False,self,,,,,

1. Rule #2 is: ""Submissions must be future focused"". That is clearly not the case with this article, so why has it not been removed?

2. [Given that electrek is in the business of promoting Tesla for financial gain](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2017/09/65000-pyramid-electric-autojournos-pump-tesla-stock-receive-massive-gifts/), why is there no disclaimer on their articles?

 If you search for submissions from electrek.co on this subreddit, almost all of them are about Tesla or Musk. Here are the top submissions from electrek this month: https://i.imgur.com/aiCDHqz.png

 I'm all for renewable energy but I think the submissions on this subreddit should still be objective reporting rather than blatant advertisements.

 In order to combat this, I would propose something similar as /r/worldnews is doing, which are automatic disclaimers for biased sources, such as this one:

&gt;Users often report submissions from this site and ask us to ban it for sensationalised articles. At /r/worldnews, we oppose blanket banning any news source. Readers have a responsibility to be skeptical, check sources, and comment on any flaws.

Everything depends on GPU computing power price and screen manufacturing costs (very similar process to integrated circuits). So, once 50% of the PC market has a GTX 1080 or superior, we can start talking about mainstream VR with dedicated triple A titles. When can this happen?

Well, according to Steam:

http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/

We are now between GTX 950 and GTX 1060 as 50% of the market. Not enough for good and stable VR. 

Maybe in two years (time between gens) we'll be between 1050 and 2060 (if it's finally the name).

So, my guess it's 2021 for 50% VR ready PCs worldwide and by 2024-2025 it will be absolutely mainstream with 80% penetration reaching the peak. 

What do you think? Are my calculations right or not? Thanks for reading.",7,6,False,self,,,,,

Would we (or even, should we) depend on this AI ""oracle"" to make all of the political and economical decisions for us regarding how to run our nation, or would we continue to vote for human presidential candidates that may be more vulnerable to corruption, greed, incompetence, et cetera?

The irony is that obviously we don't like dictatorships, but wouldn't this technically count as one, even though we'd input the values of justice, equality, and so on? What are your thoughts, Reddit users?

We have used AC for like a hundred years as AC just had too many advantages, especially in the part of getting higher voltages. But recent technological changes enable us to get DC at high voltages.

DC at high voltages has the advantage of being transmittable over vastly longer distances than AC can be. Another point is, that stuff like solar power is created as DC.

The important part here is, we are losing a shitload of energy into creating AC and to put it into the network. However when we use DC we could for example get electricity generated from the solar plant a thousand miles away, even though there is no sun currently. Simply because now we can transmit electricity over a distance like this with nearly no losses.

Like an oak tree the individual who is grounded with strong roots into the earth of reality, won't crash at the first storm.  I offer pointers about the future based upon common patterns of history:

1. human nature has a dark side.  All technology is a tool that will harm or benefit depending upon how its user or owner uses it.  If you plug your brain into the system, someone is going to manipulate, control, monitor or kill you by hacking into you.  Governments will use drones and AI against humans and their own citizens.  Automated passenger aircraft will be hacked and smashed into the ground.

2. Only the rich will afford the technologies.  Plenty of people in my town are unable to afford rent and house, they are homeless sleeping in shop doorways and tents.  Many people in my town are unable to afford food, so they go to food banks for weekly food handouts.  Only the rich can afford all these nice expensive technologies.  Technology will drive the divide further between rich and poor.  Crypto currency at the moment favors the rich who can afford the the high transaction fees to get their transaction recorded on the blockchain faster than the poor.  The rich and poor are not on an equal footing in crypto currency transactions.  Whilst millions of rich Americans can afford a smart toaster, oven and fridge, the poor of East Sudan and Yemen will starve to death in their millions.  

3. Climate change and the failing eco-systems historically leads to the collapse of civilizations and empires.  In the next few years the city of Cape Town in South Africa will run out of water.  In less than 30 years the nation of Iran will cease to exist as it runs out of water.  The great water and food crisis is coming when nation will fight nation for food and water.  Fish stocks in the oceans are falling, the bees are vanishing and the forests are being cut down.

4. debt is causing nations to fail.  My town is riddled with pot holes in the roads because they are unable to afford to fill them in.  Most nations in the world are collapsing under debt, with debts accumulating daily.  Someone has to pay for all this debt.

Also what are the limits for a machine to experience? Would just making an AS torture it for an eternity by making it experience extremely slow time intervals?

Also, how do you guys think justice will work to try to stop people from torturing others for eons subjectively?

100G program
The 100G program is exploring high-order modulation and spatial multiplexing techniques to achieve the 100 Gb/s capacity at ranges of 200 km air-to-air and 100 km air-to-ground from a high-altitude (e.g. 60,000 ft.) aerial platform. The program is leveraging the characteristics of millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies to produce spectral efficiencies at or above 20 bits-per-second per Hz. Computationally efficient signal processing algorithms are also being developed to meet size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations of host platforms, which will primarily be high-altitude, long-endurance aerial platforms.

2.ACCESS

The ultimate goal of the DARPA Accelerated Computation for Efficient Scientific Simulation (ACCESS) is to demonstrate new, specialized benchtop technology that can solve large problems in complex physical systems on the hour timescale, compared to existing methods that require full cluster-scale supercomputing resources and take weeks to months

3.Active Social Engineering Defense

I find this one especially interesting because the definition of ""attacker"" could easily shift to ""dissenter"" enabling complete control over the currently unregulated spread of politically inconvenient ideas through the internet

The Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) program aims to develop the core technology to enable the capability to automatically elicit information from a malicious adversary in order to identify, disrupt, and investigate social engineering attacks. If successful, the ASED technology will do this by mediating communications between users and potential attackers, actively detecting attacks and coordinating investigations to discover the identity of the attacker.

4.Advanced Plant Technologies

Great now you will have to be suspicious of new weeds popping up your backyard

The Advanced Plant Technologies (APT) program seeks to develop plants capable of serving as next-generation, persistent, ground-based sensor technologies to protect deployed troops and the homeland by detecting and reporting on chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) threats. Such biological sensors would be effectively energy-independent, increasing their potential for wide distribution, while reducing risks associated with deployment and maintenance of traditional sensors. These technologies could also potentially support humanitarian operations by, for example, detecting unexploded ordnance in post-conflict settings. DARPAs technical vision for APT is to harness plants innate mechanisms for sensing and responding to environmental stimuli, extend that sensitivity to a range of signals of interest, and engineer discreet response mechanisms that can be remotely monitored using existing ground-, air-, or space-based hardware.

5.ARES This one has a neat picture

https://imgur.com/a/no7OHl2
ARES is a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) flight module designed to operate as an unmanned platform capable of transporting a variety of payloads. The ARES VTOL flight module is designed to have its own power system, fuel, digital flight controls and remote command-and-control interfaces. Twin tilting ducted fans would provide efficient hovering and landing capabilities in a compact configuration, with rapid conversion to high-speed cruise flight.

6.ALASA

The goal of DARPAs Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program is to develop a significantly less expensive approach for routinely launching small satellites, with a goal of at least threefold reduction in costs compared to current military and U.S. commercial launch costs. Currently, small satellite payloads cost more than $30,000 per pound to launch, and must share a launcher with other satellites. ALASA seeks to propel 100-pound satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) within 24 hours of call-up, all for less than $1 million per launch.

7.Nanoscale Products

The A2P program was conceived to deliver scalable technologies for assembly of nanometer- to micron-scale componentswhich frequently possess unique characteristics due to their small sizeinto larger, human-scale systems. The goal of the A2P program is to achieve never-before-seen functionality by using scalable processes to assemble fully 3-dimensional devices that include nanometer- to micron-scale components.

8.ADEPT

The ADEPT programs four thrusts cover simple-to-use, on-demand diagnostics for medical decision-making and accurate threat-tracking; novel methods for rapidly manufacturing new types of vaccines with increased potency; novel tools to engineer mammalian cells for targeted drug delivery and in vivo diagnostics; and novel methods to impart near-immediate immunity to an individual using antibodies.

9.Battlefield Medicine

the Pharmacy on Demand (PoD) and Biologically-derived Medicines on Demand (Bio-MOD) initiatives. The combined efforts seek to develop miniaturized device platforms and techniques that can produce multiple small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and therapeutic proteins in response to specific battlefield threats and medical needs as they arise. PoD research is aimed at developing and demonstrating the capability to manufacture multiple APIs of varying chemical complexity using shelf-stable precursors, while Bio-MOD research is focused on developing novel, flexible methodologies for genetic engineering and modification of microbial strains, mammalian cell lines, and cell-free systems to synthesize multiple protein-based therapeutics

10.BRICS

The Biological Robustness in Complex Settings (BRICS) program aims to transform engineered microbial biosystems into reliable, cost-effective strategic resources for the Department of Defense (DoD), enabling future applications in the areas of intelligence, readiness, and force protection. Examples include the identification of the geographical provenance of objects; protection of critical systems and infrastructure against corrosion, biofouling, and other damage; sensing of hazardous compounds; and efficient, on-demand bio-production of novel coatings, fuels, and drugs.

11.Bigs

The Big Mechanism program aims to develop technology to read research abstracts and papers to extract pieces of causal mechanisms, assemble these pieces into more complete causal models, and reason over these models to produce explanations. The domain of the program is cancer biology with an emphasis on signaling pathways. Although the domain of the Big Mechanism program is cancer biology, the overarching goal of the program is to develop technologies for a new kind of science in which research is integrated more or less immediatelyautomatically or semi-automaticallyinto causal, explanatory models of unprecedented completeness and consistency. Cancer pathways are just one example of causal, explanatory models.

12.Blue Wolf

Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise. UUV size, weight and volume are constrained by the handling, launch and recovery systems on their host platforms, however, and UUV range is limited by the amount of energy available for propulsion and the power required for a given underwater speed. Current state-of-the-art energy sources are limited by safety and certification requirements for host platforms. The Blue Wolf program seeks to develop and demonstrate an integrated UUV capable of operating at speed-range combinations previously unachievable on current representative platforms, while retaining traditional volume and weight fractions for payloads and electronics.

13.CRASH

The Clean-Slate Design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts (CRASH) program will pursue innovative research into the design of new computer systems that are highly resistant to cyber-attack, can adapt after a successful attack to continue rendering useful services, learn from previous attacks how to guard against and cope with future attacks, and can repair themselves after attacks have succeeded. Exploitable vulnerabilities originate from a handful of known sources (e.g., memory safety); they remain because of deficits in tools, languages and hardware that could address and prevent vulnerabilities at the design, implementation and execution stages. Often, making a small change in one of these stages can greatly ease the task in another. The CRASH program will encourage such cross layer co-design and participation from researchers in any relevant area.

14.CWC

The Communicating with Computers (CwC) program aims to enable symmetric communication between people and computers in which machines are not merely receivers of instructions but collaborators, able to harness a full range of natural modes including language, gesture and facial or other expressions. For the purposes of the CwC program, communication is understood to be the sharing of complex ideas in collaborative contexts.

15.SocialSim

A simulation of the spread and evolution of online information, if accurate and at-scale, could enable a deeper and more quantitative understanding of adversaries use of the global information environment than is currently possible using existing approaches. At present, the U.S. Government employs small teams of experts to speculate how information may spread online. While these activities provide some insight, they take considerable time to orchestrate and execute, the accuracy with which they represent real-world online behavior is unknown, and their scale (in terms of the size and granularity with which populations are represented) is such that they can represent only a fraction of the real world. High-fidelity (i.e., accurate, at-scale) computational simulation of the spread and evolution of online information would support efforts to analyze strategic disinformation campaigns by adversaries, deliver critical information to local populations during disaster relief operations, and could potentially contribute to other critical missions in the online information domain.

16.Satellite Repair

Recent technological advances have made the longstanding dream of on-orbit robotic servicing of satellites a near-term possibility. The potential advantages of that unprecedented capability are enormous. Instead of designing their satellites to accommodate the harsh reality that, once launched, their investments could never be repaired or upgraded, satellite owners could use robotic vehicles to physically inspect, assist, and modify their on-orbit assets. That could significantly lower construction and deployment costs while dramatically extending satellite utility, resilience, and reliability.

17.Deep Exploration

Automated, deep natural-language processing (NLP) technology may hold a solution for more efficiently processing text information and enabling understanding connections in text that might not be readily apparent to humans. DARPA created the Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text (DEFT) program to harness the power of NLP. Sophisticated artificial intelligence of this nature has the potential to enable defense analysts to efficiently investigate orders of magnitude more documents so they can discover implicitly expressed, actionable information contained within them.

ElectRX
The Electrical Prescriptions (ElectRx) program aims to support military operational readiness by reducing the time to treatment, logistical challenges, and potential off-target effects associated with traditional medical interventions for a wide range of physical and mental health conditions commonly faced by our warfighters. ElectRx seeks to deliver non-pharmacological treatments for pain, general inflammation, post-traumatic stress, severe anxiety, and trauma that employ precise, closed-loop, non-invasive modulation of the patients peripheral nervous system.

19.Engineered Living Materials

The Engineered Living Materials (ELM) program seeks to revolutionize military logistics and construction in remote, austere, high-risk, and/or post-disaster environments by developing living biomaterials that combine the structural properties of traditional building materials with attributes of living systems, including the ability to rapidly grow in situ, self-repair, and adapt to the environment. Living materials could solve existing challenges associated with the construction and maintenance of built environments, and introduce new capabilities to craft smart infrastructure that dynamically responds to its surroundings

20.Enhanced Attribution

The Enhanced Attribution program aims to make currently opaque malicious cyber adversary actions and individual cyber operator attribution transparent by providing high-fidelity visibility into all aspects of malicious cyber operator actions and to increase the governments ability to publicly reveal the actions of individual malicious cyber operators without damaging sources and methods. The program will develop techniques and tools for generating operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent independent malicious cyber campaigns, each involving several operators, and the means to share such information with any of a number of interested parties.

21.EXACALIBUR

Handheld Laser guns yo

The DARPA Excalibur program will develop coherent optical phased array technologies to enable scalable laser weapons that are 10 times lighter and more compact than existing high-power chemical laser systems. The optical phased array architecture provides electro-optical systems with the same mission flexibility and performance enhancements that microwave phased arrays provide for RF systems and a multifunction Excalibur array may also perform laser radar, target designation, laser communications, and airborne-platform self protection tasks.

22.Xsolids

Materials with superior strength, density and resiliency properties are important for the harsh environments in which Department of Defense platforms, weapons and their components operate. Recent scientific advances have opened up new possibilities for material design in the ultrahigh pressure regime (up to three million times higher than atmospheric pressure). Materials formed under ultrahigh pressure, known as extended solids, exhibit dramatic changes in physical, mechanical and functional properties and may offer significant improvements to armor, electronics, propulsion and munitions systems in any aerospace, ground or naval platform.

23.GREMLINS

DARPA has launched the Gremlins program. Named for the imaginary, mischievous imps that became the good luck charms of many British pilots during World War II, the program envisions launching groups of UASs from existing large aircraft such as bombers or transport aircraftas well as from fighters and other small, fixed-wing platformswhile those planes are out of range of adversary defenses. When the gremlins complete their mission, a C-130 transport aircraft would retrieve them in the air and carry them home, where ground crews would prepare them for their next use within 24 hours.

24.HAPTIX

HAPTIX builds on prior DARPA investments in the Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, which created novel neural interface systems that overcame previous sensor reliability issues to now last for the lifetime of the patient. A key focus of HAPTIX is on creating new technologies to interface permanently and continuously with the peripheral nerves in humans. HAPTIX technologies are being designed to tap into the motor and sensory signals of the arm to allow users to control and sense the prosthesis via the same neural signaling pathways used for intact limbs. Direct access to these natural control signals will, if successful, enable more natural, intuitive control of complex hand movements, and the addition of sensory feedback will further improve hand functionality by enabling users to sense grip force and hand posture. Sensory feedback may also provide important psychological benefits such as improving prosthesis embodiment and reducing the phantom limb pain that is suffered by approximately 80 percent of amputees.

25.IVN

The IVN Diagnostics (IVN:Dx) effort aims to develop a generalized in vivo platform that provides continuous physiological monitoring for the warfighter. Specifically, IVN:Dx investigates technologies that incorporate implantable nanoplatforms composed of bio-compatible, nontoxic materials; in vivo sensing of small and large molecules of biological interest; multiplexed detection of analytes at clinically relevant concentrations; and external interrogation of the nanoplatforms without using implanted electronics for communication. The IVN Therapeutics (IVN:Tx) effort seeks unobtrusive nanoplatforms for rapidly treating disease in warfighters. This program is pursuing treatments that increase safety and minimize the dose required for clinically relevant efficacy; limit off-target effects; limit immunogenicity; increase effectiveness by targeting delivery to specific tissues and/or uptake by cells of interest; increase bioavailability; knock down medically relevant molecular target(s); and increase resistance to degradation. If successful, such platforms will enable prevention and treatment of military-relevant illnesses such as infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms.

26.MemeX

DARPA has launched the Memex program. Memex seeks to develop software that advances online search capabilities far beyond the current state of the art. The goal is to invent better methods for interacting with and sharing information, so users can quickly and thoroughly organize and search subsets of information relevant to their individual interests. The technologies developed in the program would provide the mechanisms for improved content discovery, information extraction, information retrieval, user collaboration and other key search functions.

27.Light-matter Interactions

Recent advances in our understanding of light-matter interactions, often with patterned and resonant structures, reveal nascent concepts for new interactions that may impact many applications. Examples of these novel phenomena include interactions involving active media, symmetry, non-reciprocity, and linear/nonlinear resonant coupling effects. Insights regarding the origins of these interactions have the potential to transform our understanding of how to control electromagnetic waves and design for new light-matter interactions. The goal of NLM is to bring together and integrate these emerging phenomena with fundamental models that can describe and predict new functionality. These models will provide design tools and delineate the performance limits of new engineered light-matter interactions. Important applications to be addressed in the program include synthesizing new material structures for sources, non-reciprocal behavior, parametric phenomena, limiters, electromagnetic drives, and energy harvesting.

28.NESD

The Neural Engineering System Design (NESD) program seeks to develop high-resolution neurotechnology capable of mitigating the effects of injury and disease on the visual and auditory systems of military personnel. In addition to creating novel hardware and algorithms, the program conducts research to understand how various forms of neural sensing and actuation might improve restorative therapeutic outcomes. The focus of the program is development of advanced neural interfaces that provide high signal resolution, speed, and volume data transfer between the brain and electronics, serving as a translator for the electrochemical language used by neurons in the brain and the ones and zeros that constitute the language of information technology. The program aims to develop an interface that can read 106 neurons, write to 105 neurons, and interact with 103 neurons full-duplex, a far greater scale than is possible with existing neurotechnology.

29.Neuro - FAST

Military personnel control sophisticated systems, experience extraordinary stress, and are subject to injury of the brain. DARPA created the Neuro Function, Activity, Structure, and Technology (Neuro-FAST) program to begin to address these challenges by combining innovative neurotechnology with an advanced understanding of the brain. Using a multidisciplinary approach that combines data processing, mathematical modeling, and novel optical interfaces, the program seeks to open new pathways for understanding and treating brain injury, enable unprecedented visualization and decoding of brain activity, and build sophisticated tools for communicating with the brain.

30.PHOENIX

Satlets: A new low-cost, modular satellite architecture that can scale almost infinitely. Satlets are small independent modules (roughly 15 pounds/7 kg) that incorporate essential satellite functionality (power supplies, movement controls, sensors, etc.). Satlets share data, power and thermal management capabilities. They also physically aggregate (attach together) in different combinations that would provide capabilities to accomplish a range of diverse space missions with any type, size or shape payload. Because they are modular, they can be produced on an assembly line at low cost and integrated very quickly with different payloads. DARPA is presently focused on validating the technical concept of satlets in LEO.

Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system: The POD is a standardized mechanism designed to safely carry a wide variety of separable mass elements to orbitincluding payloads, satlets and electronicsaboard commercial communications satellites. This approach would take advantage of the tempo and hosted payloads services that commercial satellites now provide while enabling lower-cost delivery to GEO.

31:Revolutionary Prostetics

Revolutionizing Prosthetics performer teams developed two anthropomorphic, advanced, modular prototype prosthetic arm systems, including sockets, which offer users increased dexterity, strength, and range of motion over traditional prosthetic limbs. The program has developed neurotechnology to enable direct neural control of these systems, as well as non-invasive means of control. DARPA is also studying the restoration of sensation, connecting sensors to the arm systems and returning haptic feedback from the arm directly back to volunteers brains. The LUKE Arm system was originally developed for DARPA by DEKA Research and Development Corporation. The modular, battery-powered arm enables dexterous arm and hand movement through a simple, intuitive control system that allows users to move multiple joints simultaneously. Years of testing and optimization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs led to clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2014 and creation of a commercial-scale manufacturer, Mobius Bionics, in July 2016. In June 2017, the first two LUKE Arm systems were prescribed to veterans. The Modular Prosthetic Limb, developed for DARPA by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, is a more complex hand and arm system designed primarily as a research tool. It is used to test direct neural control of a prosthesis. In studies, volunteers living with paralysis have demonstrated multi-dimensional control of the hand and arm using electrode arrays placed on their brains, as well as restoration of touch sensation via a closed-loop interface connecting the brain with haptic sensors in the arm system.

32.SAFEGENES

Safe Genes performer teams work across three primary technical focus areas to develop tools and methodologies to control, counter, and even reverse the effects of genome editingincluding gene drivesin biological systems across scales. First, researchers are developing the genetic circuitry and genome editing machinery for robust, spatial, temporal, and reversible control of genome editing activity in living systems. Second, researchers are developing small molecules and molecular strategies to provide prophylactic and treatment solutions that prevent or limit genome editing activity and protect the genome integrity of organisms and populations. Third, researchers are developing genetic remediation strategies that eliminate unwanted engineered genes from a broad range of complex population and environmental contexts to restore systems to functional and genetic baseline states.

33:TNT

The Targeted Neuroplasticity Training (TNT) program supports improved, accelerated training of military personnel in multifaceted and complex tasks. The program is investigating the use of non-invasive neurotechnology in combination with training to boost the neurochemical signaling in the brain that mediates neural plasticity and facilitates long-term retention of new cognitive skills. If successful, TNT technology would apply to a wide range of defense-relevant needs, including foreign language learning, marksmanship, cryptography, target discrimination, and intelligence analysis, improving outcomes while reducing the cost and duration of the Defense Departments extensive training regimen. TNT focuses on a specific kind of learningcognitive skills training. The premise is that during optimal times in the training process, precise activation of peripheral nerves through stimulation can boost the release of brain chemicals such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine that promote and strengthen neuronal connections in the brain. These so-called neuromodulators play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity, the process by which connections between neurons change to improve brain function during learning. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, the TNT program seeks to leverage endogenous neural circuitry to enhance learning by facilitating tuning of the neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.

34:SD2

The Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program aims to develop data-driven methods to accelerate scientific discovery and robust design in domains that lack complete models. Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics, automobiles, and integrated circuits. In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and polymer chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models. SD2 seeks to develop tools to enable robust design despite the lack of complete scientific models.

35:SeeMe

DARPAs SeeMe program aims to give mobile individual US warfighters access to on-demand, space-based tactical information in remote and beyond- line-of-sight conditions. If successful, SeeMe will provide small squads and individual teams the ability to receive timely imagery of their specific overseas location directly from a small satellite with the press of a button  something thats currently not possible from military or commercial satellites. The program seeks to develop a constellation of small disposable satellites, at a fraction of the cost of airborne systems, enabling deployed warfighters overseas to hit see me on existing handheld devices to receive a satellite image of their precise location within 90 minutes. DARPA plans SeeMe to be an adjunct to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, which provides local and regional very-high resolution coverage but cannot cover extended areas without frequent refueling. SeeMe aims to support warfighters in multiple deployed overseas locations simultaneously with no logistics or maintenance costs beyond the warfighters handheld devices.

36.StarNET

Working together, DARPA, along with companies from the semiconductor and defense industriesApplied Materials, Global Foundries, IBM, Intel, Micron, Raytheon, Texas Instruments and United Technologieshave established the Semiconductor Technology Advanced Research Network (STARnet). This effort builds a large multi-university research community to look beyond current evolutionary directions to make discoveries that drive technology innovation beyond what can be imagined for electronics today. The universities are organized into six centers, each focused on a specific challenge.

Function Accelerated nanomaterial Engineering (FAME) focuses on nonconventional materials and devices incorporating nanostructures with quantum-level properties to enable analog, logic and memory devices for beyond-binary computation.

Center for Spintronic Materials, Interfaces and Novel Architectures (C-SPIN) focuses onelectron spin-based memory and computation to overcome the power, performance and architectural constraints of conventional CMOS-based devices.

Systems on Nanoscale Information fabriCs (SONIC) explores a drastic shift in the model of computation and communication from a deterministic digital foundation to a statistical one.

Center for Low Energy Systems Technology (LEAST) pursues low power electronics. For this purpose it addresses nonconventional materials and quantum-engineered devices, and projects implementation in novel integrated circuits and computing architectures.

The Center for Future Architectures Research (C-FAR) investigates highly parallel computing implemented in nonconventional computing systems, but based on current CMOS integrated circuit technology.

The TerraSwarm Research Center (TerraSwarm) focuses on the challenge of developing technologies that provide innovative, city-scale capabilities via the deployment of distributed applications on shared swarm platforms.

37.Z-Man

The Z-Man programs aims to develop biologically inspired climbing aids to enable warfighters to scale vertical walls constructed from typical building materials, while carrying a full combat load, and without the use of ropes or ladders. Geckos, spiders and small animals are the inspiration behind the Z-Man program.

Will it take longer than expected?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8fto0k/driverassist_ai_vs_level_5_automation_an_awkward/,KubrickIsMyCopilot,1525030400,"Self-driving automotive technology is in a strange twilight zone where AI is not yet quite superior to human drivers by itself, and yet...AI augmented by an attentive human driver *is* superior to either driving alone.  In other words, we have entered an unanticipated domain where ""tag-team driving"" - a cooperative effort of AI and a human driver to cover each other's faults - has surpassed the typical performance of a human driver.  It's basically a ""cyborg car"" rather than a robot car.

As this period was largely not foreseen before about a decade ago - and understandably so, given that awkward transitions rarely make for compelling product pitches or science fiction - **are we underestimating how long the transition will take?**

Consider this: Current driver-assist technology will soon not be competing with human drivers, but with other driver-assist technology - i.e., with the combination of the car's native capabilities and those of a human driver increasingly experienced with leveraging the features.

What this means is that driver-assist software doesn't necessarily have to increase the level of automation toward full autonomy to achieve a better car-driver ""cybocar"" product - all it has to do is achieve a better overall result, which includes options that better engage the human element.  It may take considerably longer to explore that space of possibilities than we currently imagine.

Another implication - and the most interesting one - is that fully autonomous ""robocars"" will not be competing with human drivers at all, but with these cybocars: With human-machine tag teams.  That moves the goalposts for autonomy quite a bit, and there's no telling how far they will continue to move.

At what point will full automation be superior not to human drivers, but to affordable mass-market combination of semi-automation and human driving?  Could it be that an entire generation will know a driving experience more akin to their ancestors' relationship with *horses*, rather than either the Nietzschean power of pure human driving or the forgetful luxury of full automation?

If so, and this era proves to be more than a transition, the implications are considerable - and range far beyond transportation.  If tag-team cybernetic functioning can hold its own for a long period of time against full automation, then that changes the equation for those with concerns about the dangers of AI.  

It doesn't completely reverse it, of course - but the timelines may be more forgiving than we imagine.  So this is a topic that doesn't seem to have gotten attention quite yet, but it deserves more analysis.    ",7,12,False,self,,,,,
