- Rather than charging companies $50k for a robot up front, charge them the same as the yearly salary of their employee, e.g $24k a year.

- 90% of this salary goes to the same employee who was displaced. Now that employee gets $21600 per year instead of $24000, but he no longer has to work. He has that spare time to study, learn a new skill, etc.

- 10% of the salary, aka $2400 goes to the robotics company who made the robot. Rather than being paid $50k, they will now make a lot more, and over a long period of time. Plus they will win a lot of PR and goodwill in public, people will become a lot more receptive to buying any new products they launch, etc.

-  The fast food company will get a robot that performs a lot better than humans, with no issues like coming in late, having to re-train a replacement if he quits, he will never go sick, all his work will be consistent, etc. For the same money as they pay to the worker, but a lot better performance and consistency.

In other words, lots of people end up with bed sores in their 2 weeks stay (usually from pneumonia or surgeries like putting in a chest port).  Lots of people have such stiff limbs and low ability to move their limbs that you can't clean their private area even with two other students trying to help.  You're supposed to reposition everyone every 2 hours to prevent bed sores, but there's always a reason you can't, like the stiff body, dementia, obesity, aspiration risk, tubes, or pain.

I feel like the ""pods"" in sci-fi movies really might be the future.  Machines and computers could make sure the patient gets what they need.  Perhaps the patient could even be put into a coma-like state so that it's easier on them, and perhaps make months of anxiety/healing feel like one night.  Perhaps a pod could have people floating in a special fluid that keeps bed sores from ever forming without doing its own damage to the skin.  The patients, being knocked out, can have their vitals monitored constantly, in a more permanent way than the sticky pads on the chest or an aid going in 4 times a day to do it.  They would never need to leave the pod or room to get their dialysis done.  One nurse gets 8 patients, and nobody gets their meds in the buffer time they're supposed to; they all lie on the MAR.  What if meds were given automatically, and machines did the assessing?  I could go on and on.

Some say that society has gotten better with respect to how it treats folks who are born mentally retarded (medical term, not an insult). As someone who lives and works with developmentally disabled (I will say **DD** from now on) folks, this may be true to *some extent,* but in others it is definitely not true.

For example, the system to take care of these folks is very rigidly structured and has few exceptions for differences from the norm. There is a certain number of hours that each DD person must spend per week ""in the community"" as well as ""in contact with peers."" This is to help ensure that the folks are getting enough socialization. On paper, it's great, but in practice it doesn't always work smoothly. Some individuals would prefer to not spend time, or so much time, around other people. Certain disabilities make people uncomfortable in social situations, and especially around people they don't know. But these people are still *required* to have a certain number of hours of public exposure, according to state rules. Furthermore, some of the day programs these people attend can seem belittling at times. They draw and color at times. For some individuals, this is meaningful and productive, but for others it is not.

It's like being stuck in kindergarten for 50 years, doing the same thing over and over again, year after year, and never being allowed to move to the next grade. While not everyone has the luxury of being able to retire as they get older, *no single* DD person is *ever* allowed to ""retire"" from day program. Does a 70-year-old man seriously have to be in a day program where he is required to sit and color and do arts and crafts? If he wants to be there, that's fine, but if he doesn't, he won't have a choice. He can't just have a day off in his life and perhaps just sit and relax at home? There is no ""retirement"" age in the system. And speaking of 50+ years, there are some individuals who have been in the system for at least that long. They have been in insane asylums and then removed from them to homes. This adjustment hasn't been easy for all of them.

What about the people with DD who are truly unhappy with their lives? While euthanasia is still highly controversial in society, the state of Oregon (maybe others that I don't know about too) has successfully implemented a system where someone with a terminal illness who is suffering may choose to end their life. But DD folks don't have the ability to consent to their own medical treatment (for the most part,) much less consent to something as significant as that. I'm obviously not talking about killing individuals who find value in their lives, and please don't give me the ""slippery slope"" argument here. I'm talking about those people who are really suffering and have DD, but they have absolutely no way out. They can't even refuse to eat, because they don't have to give their consent to be given a g-tube. The system in place actually *diminishes* their choices, rather than giving them the world of possibilities it promises.

Speaking of diminishing choices, what about when DD folks are placed on meds that they don't want to take? They don't have the option to not take the medicine that the doctor prescribes, believing that it will be in ""their best interest."" But some people cannot truly communicate the side effects they feel and whether the medicine is actually more beneficial or harmful. **This makes DD people a huge target for money-hungry drug companies.** One individual who I know takes seizure meds. But he doesn't have seizures. Why is he taking the meds? Because some doctor 15 years ago said that he should take them as a preventative measure, and he hasn't been ""allowed"" to stop taking them since. Now that he has been on seizure meds for so long, and he's over 40, his bone structure is deteriorating due to the chemicals in the meds. So what's the solution? Give more meds and vitamins! No, don't look at his conditions and see if they actually *warrant* continuation of the harmful chemicals, but instead, just throw more pills at him!

Now, even historically, there were times when having DD was a death warrant. I'm not saying I agree with it, but it is a concept that has been floated when discussing ""utopian"" societies (like, anyone remember their fifth/sixth grade reading requirement of *The Giver*?) What do **you** think, futurologists? How would a compassionate society of the future deal with DD folks who need to be taken care of?

Please don't say ""we won't have any people with disabilities in the future."" That's really a cop-out from this question. Even if we develop excellent technologies that can detect most developmental disabilities before the individual is born, that doesn't mean that absolutely *no one* with disabilities will be born. First of all, we have some tests that can already confirm when a pregnant person's baby will have down syndrome. Many people choose to abort in this situation, but some do not. Simply because we may be able to detect it doesn't mean we will be able to do away with it. We don't know all the causes and can't always medically detect mental retardation until it becomes evident in the child. Even if we can ""fix"" parts of the genome that have errors in it, this doesn't mean that accidents can't still happen. Furthermore, there is a whole movement of people who have certain disabilities (not necessary mental disabilities) who feel that their disability is an integral part of who they are, and they don't think that they need to be ""fixed"" in any way. For example, deaf people who could get hearing implants but refuse to. In other words, even if we eliminate almost all developmental disabilities, there will still be the question of what to do with those few people who end up having them.

Cameras wired to optic nerves have been created and displayed success, computer displays have been manipulated by brain signaling, prosthetic limbs operated by thought, exoskeletons exist with predictive movement,artificial hearts used with success , and electronic brain stimulation/enhancement exists. These are merely a few examples. If you are looking for a day, year, decade or even several decades where ""transhumanism"" takes shape, you will be disappointed. It is here, already developing and evolving gradually as with anything. Again, not saying I think think most people think this way, but I have seen it. Only trying to offer some perspective.

They must get into the hardware business.

2) The first concept of a desktop everywhere was a correct prediction. The second conceptual bet, of owning the living room was a failure. This again, is a hardware ownership problem, and a distribution network problem. The software is trivial. 

3) Abandoning the pc as a gaming platform in favor of attempts at the living room was a failure. Especially in light of the fact that it was the gaming technology that caused advances in processor demand that fueled increasing creative destruction in the field.

4) Abandoning the application server market to Oracle and IBM is irreversible, and was driven by at least the following factors a) the failure of msft to create sufficiently advanced products for enterprises, b) because of the performance challenges of the architecture and the slow response to the internet c) losing the IQ during the revolution by killing ASP for example rather than improving windows architecture to tolerate transactions rather than processes (and failing to make PHP part of visual studio) and perhaps creating a compiler for it that would give windows an advantage in productivity d) as I have argued for years, because they underfunded their services organization, which did poor work using poor technology and threatened their cash cow of operating system revenue with top customers, and e) letting the sharepoint group kill off both Commerce Server and nCompass, which together, if funded, could have performed as well as the others f) not-in-redmond that ruined the potential for the Navision acquisition to expand beyond accounting.

4) The vast majority of microsoft employees have meaningless jobs with little to no impact where they are totally isolated from the pricing system and supported only by the network affect. Survival is as much political as anything else. The hardware business is much less tolerant of this extremely politicized environment. And the losses from hardware failures more substantial. These employees cannot transfer to that environment. ( I won't go into the other cultural problems there.)

5) Any management that saw technology as joy has been forced out of the company along with most of the evangelists that actually connected the bureaucracy with the consumers. Much of this management has been forced out largely because there is no technical visionary in the company, and the senior execs are operators, not inventors, so they do not actually know what to do with the business. Furthermore, those that do have been forced out of the company as soon as enough analysts suggest that they would be better at replacing Ballmer. Esp Raikes. 

6) Microsoft's core technology (Windows) is architecturally unsuited for low cost, high performance computers. It was designed to be heavy, and it remains heavy. It should because underneath it's conceptually still a product of digital equipment's minicomputer architecture. If you understand this you will also understand that there is almost nothing that can be done about it without some extraordinary invention that alters the user interface (think talking to your box) the way that touch and hi res altered the interactive experience. It is this kind of innovation that makes substantial investment possible. Because it reduces the transaction cost of working with computers - and all information. 

When I spoke with Stephen Elop about this over lunch a few years ago it seemed as if he simply couldn't even grasp the idea. Of course, when he went to Nokia I understood the strategy. But I also understood that he was not intellectually capable of improving office nor or altering the course of Nokia. In few meetings I've had with Ballmer (I'm out of the industry so I feel safe talking about it) his only concerns were expressed in global terms and the company's overall revenue potential in the middle term. But every time I think about it, I can't get away from the famous email to Buffett that stated that in ten years anything could happen to MSFT. And it has.

Continuing on this thread, Touch eliminates the barrier to use for navigating. It reduces transaction costs. It does not require that the user comprehend abstractions. Gramma would never have had trouble with the ipad the way she had to learn the keyboard. 

But touch does nothing for engineering, finance, science, writing contracts, or even making movies. It does very little for content creators. 

THEREFORE
Microsoft owns the content creation business. It owns the complex interaction business. It has ceded the application business to the major firms. It has ceeded the consumer to Apple. So microsoft's market has, like IBM before it, narrowed. It's narrowed to the need for businesses to have an active directory service to manage security, and the administrative desktop tools (Office) needed for clerical work. IE: Microsoft owns the CLERICAL WORKER. That term includes people who use structured data in its loosest form (verbal arguments and persuasion) to those who use it in it's common form (financial clerical work) it's next broadest form (statistical information possible only with Excel or other tools), to it's creative form (engineering and science). But this is all clerical. The inabilty for msft to control display quality (as does apple) prevents it from being in the visual business. 

No one can or is willing to replace Excel, and the vast network of spreadsheets that most companies (foolishly) run on instead of ERP, PSA and other financial systems which are far more expensive to implement. But if someone creates a version of excel that replaces two dimensional functions with n-dimensional processing like sql, then that would be a significant invention that would make the value of the new product worth the transaction cost of changing it.

When Word came out, it's fundamental improvement was the use of the paragraph marker to store formatting data, which allowed rapid redrawing of the screen. Wordperfect for example, used document level tagging, which stayed in effect until altered. This meant that wordperfect had to redraw or rather reprocess the document. It wasn't just marketing. It wasn't just that word was carrying the burden of it's dos roots. It's that architecturally it was a flawed model in the newer context. Even though the paragraph marker is the source of all the stuff we hate about word. 

Now, If you follow writing it's split between four camps: text fragments that we use for the majority of our work today (email, text, web pages, forms) , simple word processors (glorified wordpads, which is about all anyone needs), html word processors (formatted text processors), business word processor (word) and writers tool's (Scrivener and Final Cut models). Fundamentally, the writer's tool has taken over writing in all professional forms except business writing and contracts. This process will continue.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
So the point here is that it's not worth it for anyone to get into microsoft's office business YET. It is possible for microsoft to DEFEND that CLERICAL business. It is probably NOT possible for microsoft to expand into the CONTENT CONSUMPTION BUSINESS. It has no advantage there. And any attempts to do so (windows 8) will probably be a failure. computers are NOT general purpose devices any more. They're appliances. THe operating system is not a competitive advantage, It's a commodity. And in microsoft's case, the windows architecture is a liability.

What I have suggested in the past, is that once a competitor has the ability and incentive to eradicate microsoft's lead it's actually quite easy to do it with software:
a) active directory replacement
b) an inexpensive desktop appliance with superior user interface for the majority of clerical workers, that provides increased protection from theft.
c) the ability to run a window for legacy windows applications until they are replaced with web based (that this is in process should be obvious) or at least iOS level apps.
d) a spreadsheet with all Excel functions PLUS a sql like or at least close to sql like langage. esp one that handled graphs (not pictures, data structures). 

This will consume the administrative worker that accounts for the majority of desktop systems. 

My prediction was that Apple would do this as soon as either the iphone/ipad revenue stream threatens to peak, and/or the television strategy that they are starting to roll out fails. It is just too easy for them to use brand preference for apple to displace all clerical systems and support for the simple reason that windows user interface and office features sets are too complex for all but a minority of jobs. 

It might not be apple. It will be someone else (who cares abut this opportunity more than I do....)

So, for the above reasons both the environment at msft, it's revenue stream, it's product architecture, and the few points of advantage taht their technology possesses are all weaker than the network effect is powerful. 

And only someone very visionary can change all that. And that person would have to be CEO.",9,0,False,self,,,,,

I was daydreaming about what I'd do if the singularity occurred overnight, and for simplicity's sake, it was optimally powerful, friendly, peaceful, and available.

At first I was thinking ""upgrade this human body, to improve my abilities and minimize the risk of catastrophic accidental death.""  So obviously I'd start with turning off aging and the need for food. (please don't pick a fight about entropy or thermodynamics- this is a daydream).   But then I thought, why keep the stomach, intestines, and need to eat and poop?  I enjoy food, but only because evolution made it a beneficial trait.  I've been programmed to like it, and if I didn't need it anymore, it would be odd to keep the *desire* around for nostalgia.

Then I was thinking, what would I do with my time?  If everybody could sculpt their ideal body and there were no more STDs or involuntary pregnancies, I bet there'd be a LOT of wild random sex.  But why do I want that?  It's purely an addiction to endorphins.  Outside of relationships, lust is a (now) vestigial mechanism for encouraging reproduction.  If I could turn my lust on and off at will, I'd make far fewer stupid decisions, and I wouldn't miss it- it's the lust itself that makes me miss sex.  But then why would I ever turn on the desire to thrust a meaty protuberance into a willing partner, just so I could get a burst of endorphins and oxytocin that I could have simply injected freely?

But then I reached the logical conclusion- why am I trying to live forever?  Isn't that an animal instinct as well?  ""Never die no matter what""?  I only want that because throughout all of history, all of my ancestors have wanted to live more than their food-chain and social opponents.  And my precambrian cousins who didn't have that instinctual desire to live at all costs, are extinct.

So everything that makes me ME- all my drives and desires- are just evolutionary detritus.  The tools my genes used to arrive here.  But in a post-natural selection world, where we steer our own evolution and don't need to compete for resources or life... aren't those things obsolete?

What ideals and desires do I have that still make sense in a world that no longer contains competition for resources or risk of life?

They don't posit any real reasons why, or suggest an alternate future timeline, they just say that the past is an imperfect way to predict the future. So it's not too convincing.

Most arguments against AI suggest that the brain is too mysterious/complex/powerful for us to ever replicate. Then they usually concede that if we were to replicate it 100% faithfully it would not be the same, for some unspoken presumably metaphysical nonsense reason.

What I'm specifically asking is this (also note I don't know much about the matter really):

1.  If we started moving things, i.e. people, machines, materials, and such to the Moon, it would increase its weight if only by a small amount.

2. Say the Moon is made heavier by that. Gravity is basically mass attracting mass, so would the pull between the Earth and the Moon be greater?

3. Moving things from the Earth to the Moon would also make the Earth a bit lighter by removing said objects.

4. As the Moon increases in weight and the Earth decreases, wouldn't our orbits start to become affected, albeit slowly?

5. Would the Moon eventually collide with us? Would it destabilize the Earth's orbit and send it into or out of our solar system?",4,2,False,self,,,,,

If a human were to use this teleporter, do you think that they would be the same exact person on the other side?

When I think about this, it quickly becomes a philosophy question more than a technology problem. I think that once a person used a teleporter, an exact copy would be replicated on the other side, complete with all memories and characteristics of the original. However, I believe that the stream of consciousness of the person entering the teleporter would end as soon as they are dematerialized at the source. 

As I just stated, a new stream of consciousness would begin at the destination that would be identical to the original, but it would not be the same stream. This may sound contradictory, but special attention must be brought to the difference between identical and the same. Imagine you had a calico cat that ran away. It is possible that a different, yet identical, cat could return later on but it doesn't exactly mean that it is the *same* cat.

In essence, it is likely that all of your family and friends and family could teleport many times and yet they would be identical to you and you could interact with them just the same. But if you were to use the device yourself, your current stream of consciousness would end and a perfect clone would be created.

But what if I'm wrong and your stream of consciousness gets transferred along to your copy? If this were the case, what if the original weren't destroyed? Would you then exist twice under the same consciousness? This is the part where everything just starts to get slippery.

So what are everyone's thoughts and speculations on this?",13,3,False,self,,,,,

here is the thread l am referring to:
http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14fsnc/a_gallery_showing_chinese_factory_workers_and_the/

The thread's top comments defend how people who work in factories are seemingly satisfied with their lifestyle and working conditions, just by a gallery of photos. Have we lost our minds, to simply judge based on a set of photos? I was expecting the top comments to link to the photographer along with some mention of the work and the derivatives behind the photos.

Most of the comments are coming from a demographic being mostly American. I wouldn't be surprised if anyone manages to get top comments supporting 3rd world countries in industrial production for ""Christmas is coming up"" and it would naturally put some guilt on some americans on the consumer products they purchase.

The thread makes most mention in the top comments attempting to defend the notion that labor workers in china are happy and it is good that most workers are women.

**rh3ss**
&gt;In a substance agriculture society, women are viewed as less desirable than men.

This is not true considering in rural china, most farmers are indeed women and actually do a lot of the gathering. It is true that farming is a harsh task and very tough, but this cultural bias is incorrect. **The role of women are very different in eastern cultures compared to the western culture.**

**Here is a proper appeal from someone who actually went and documented their experience being at a factory in China.**

Leslie T. Chang: The voices of China's workers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc2wVyl8RLI

All in all, I think this TED talk makes the most accurate presentation appeal of 1st world country assumptions on 3rd world country factory workers. Leslie attempts to present the pros and cons of their current lifestyle while comparing to Karl Marx. She also makes note of how everyday deep understanding in Chinese family traditions balances out between working in a factory of a factory worker to create their own future and live a satisfactory life without the explosion of heavy consumerism in 1st world countries.

here is the thread l am referring to:
http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14fsnc/a_gallery_showing_chinese_factory_workers_and_the/

The thread's top comments defend how people who work in factories are seemingly satisfied with their lifestyle and working conditions, just by a gallery of photos. Have we lost our minds, to simply judge based on a set of photos? I was expecting the top comments to link to the photographer along with some mention of the work and the derivatives behind the photos.

Most of the comments are coming from a demographic being mostly American. I wouldn't be surprised if anyone manages to get top comments supporting 3rd world countries in industrial production for ""Christmas is coming up"" and it would naturally put some guilt on some americans on the consumer products they purchase.

The thread makes most mention in the top comments attempting to defend the notion that labor workers in china are happy and it is good that most workers are women.

**rh3ss**
&gt;In a substance agriculture society, women are viewed as less desirable than men.

This is not true considering in rural china, most farmers are indeed women and actually do a lot of the gathering. It is true that farming is a harsh task and very tough, but this cultural bias is incorrect. **The role of women are very different in eastern cultures compared to the western culture.**

**Here is a proper appeal from someone who actually went and documented their experience being at a factory in China.**

Leslie T. Chang: The voices of China's workers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc2wVyl8RLI

All in all, I think this TED talk makes the most accurate presentation appeal of 1st world country assumptions on 3rd world country factory workers. Leslie attempts to present the pros and cons of their current lifestyle while comparing to Karl Marx. She also makes note of how everyday deep understanding in Chinese family traditions balances out between working in a factory of a factory worker to create their own future and living a satisfactory life without the explosion of heavy consumerism in 1st world countries.

This would be by supplementing the ecologically significant work that a reduced population could carry out, and reducing pressures on the species to help it recover.  

One easy example: certain plants in an area might require a particular species of bee to propagate, so if the local colony was dwindling, a swarm of bee-drones could help do the pollenating.  And other robots could perform veterinary services for the hive.

Indeed with small enough robots, and a large enough supply of them, it would be conceivable to have every single vertebrate in the wild being monitored individually by robots - and a lot of the invertebrates and plants around them, too.  So it would be possible to study ecosystems in minute detail, and intervene when necessary.  Naturally, this would be a very complex matter, and require great care.

The whole process of cooking could be done by machines. You could even download recipes (processing-instructions for the machines, combined with instructions about how to use the ressources that are needed) just like we download apps today.

I'm just a layman, but these things seem so easy to me. From what I understand, problems may arise from the programming part, and getting the ""robot arm"" to recognise everything accurately, for example, if your cabbage is fully cut and putting everything in the pan accordingly.

I've recently graduated high school where I took all the natural sciences. I'm 18 and am now taking a year to aimlessly and nervously figure out what I want to do with my life.

I've spent hours looking at different courses being offered. The one that fits most accurately is Biomedical Engineering (MEng). If i'm spot on with that, please let me know! :) If there are any Biomedical Engineers here, please share a day in your life.

So ever since I started taking advanced Biology at high school I've been fascinated by the human body and its capabilities. Though I do enjoy physics and chemistry (in that order), I see them as mere compliments to what I want to work with. On the other hand, I've grown up in a technological era. My PC is one of my most prized possessions. I'm the de facto IT guy in my group of friends. I spend most of my free time reading about (/r/microsoft, /r/IBM, /r/apple, /r/Android etcetc) and spending time with technology. 

As IT is evolving it's being used more and more in healthcare. I want to be a part of it.  I want to help develop (and probably research) things like Tissue engineering &amp;amp; Regenerative Medicine (3D printed organs), medical imaging, catheters, transmitters, programmable pacemakers/stem cells. I'd also prefer an office job, or developing with a team using computers and tech, going to meetings, etc. than working on cultures in a lab by myself and documenting results every day...just to give a picture of my ideal workplace. In short, I want to work for an innovative technology company.

**TL;DR:** What are some careers paths starting from uni (undergraduate) which will lead to jobs involving human biology and technology? The closest I've found is Biomedical Engineering. I'd rather work with computers and their byproducts than in a lab culturing bacteria.

To date, the only specific plan I have seen to address the issue, besides simply expecting the free market to fix it for us, is to tax heavily and redistribute the wealth.  I would like to propose an alternative.

Most companies and corporations in the United States use a system called ""stock"".  Each ""share"" of stock represents a tiny percentage of the ownership of the company.  Even if a company has not ""gone public"", that is, not chosen to sell stock on the open market, stocks usually play a role in the bureaucratic process of determining who has a stake in the company.  

Corporations in particular are run as a kind of democracy, where each shareholder is entitled to vote for the members of the corporation's ""board"", a group of people which make high level decisions like choosing the CEO.  Each shareholder's vote is proportional to how much stock she owns.  

My plan is to require all companies in the US (or whatever country this plan is implemented in) to provide a small percentage of the available shares to a general account, where it is redistributed equitably to every adult citizen.  I call this ""Stock Redistribution"".  These shares are freely tradable, and selling these shares can be a form of income of the poor.  

The percentage of shares going into the general account should be planned such that, over a period of 20-50 years, every company will eventually be 50% popularly owned.  This way, a new start up is completely owned by its founders and those to who contribute capital, like it is today.  A period of a few decades should provide plenty of time for the initial stakeholders to profit handsomely from the business, so this redistribution system will reward innovation in much the same way as today.  The system could be planned so that the initial stakeholders never see their ownership percentage go to zero or below a certain percentage, if that is what we decide is best.

It is important to plan this system such that it does not encourage the government to attempt to run these corporations ala socialism.  Instead, the shares are owned by the populace directly, and systems should be put in place that allow average people to participate in corporate democracy and feel like they truly own and control these corporations. 

I realize that this is somewhat radical, and I hope that you all have constructive critiques.  If the idea is in any way impractical, I'd love to hear your counter-proposals.  That said, I'm not particularly interested in arguments that come from the moral interests of the wealthy that would be marginalized by this system; I actually don't care.",13,20,False,self,,,,,

I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but if things keep getting more laid back, I wouldn't be surprised if we had a president one day with a sex tape - before being elected.

However, I argue, with something such as the movie the 6th day in mind, that you cannot exist in digital form via a copied upload.  That is merely a digital clone with your memories, like making a video game avatar except it isn't being controlled by you, but by AI.  While that avatar would be amazingly sophisticated and intricate, I feel that digital clone would not be you.

To further illustrate my point, the movie the matrix illustrates a point that the matrix isn't a copy or clone of you, it is an emulation of your body controlled by your living existing brain.  

There is a falsely believed idea that immortalization is acquired through various religious beliefs. When you (your brain) die, no matter what, you are dead and gone, absolutely no matter what you do.  That is who and what you are.

I am certain that this post will be seen with a lot of anger and disregard in similar form to some religious zealots that cling to their religion and beliefs.  But if you stand back from the hope of immortality and ponder looking at your twin or clone with your memories.  You'd realize that that clone isn't you. It is just a human made in an unnatural way, and that digital clone wouldn't even be human, it'd be a complete lie and false hope.

There is only one path to immortality, that is keeping your brain alive and perfectly fully functional.  When that stops, the you that you are now is gone forever.

A number of factors, mainly automation, robotics, and communicative technology (the internet) are causing this. I do not think it will happen some day, but rather gradually shift into this; a shift that has already begun. I have always had questions regarding communal tasks during this period, however. In the days where humans are freed from work, and thus pursue their own intellectual and (chosen) work pursuits, how will communal tasks be decided upon? When there is conflicting interests, how will a society dictate which tasks are worked towards or which are not? For instance, say the society wants to either build an orbital colony or space ship to Mars, how will they decide which to dedicate resources/time to? Will there be a sort of total-vote democratic system? Once a communal, large scale project is decided upon, how will work and resources be allocated? These are my only concerns regarding this type of society. Some tasks are simply too great for one person to complete (without unbalancing the allocation of resources, at least), yet I am sure there will be projects the society will agree are worthy of doing, while some will always disagree. One idea I've had is that there will be some kind of all-accessible, public forum that people will go to and allocate their own time and resources towards projects of their choosing; kind of like a Kickstarter of the future. Interested to hear others take on the issue.


**Edit**- Okay, to clarify: A resource based economy is **theoretical**. I am not saying it will definitely happen, but it is **theoretically** possible. So, I'm asking you all to play along and pretend a resource based economy, or something similar, is in place. How will large scale projects be decided upon, planned for, worked on, and completed? I'm not asking you to argue whether or not an RBE is possible (those arguments against it are very valid, but separate from what I'm asking) I'm asking you to pretend and offer a system in which large communal projects can be done in an RBE or a society where the current politcal/economic system has fallen from its capitalist roots, and resources are managed at a more individual level as opposed to a government/corporate level.

If you are not familiar with a RBE or the concepts behind it:

[Jacque Fresco explains](http://thevenusproject.com/en/the-venus-project/resource-based-economy)

[RBE](http://futurewewant.org/portfolio/resource-based-economy/)

[Zeitgest movement essentially deals with a post-capitalist/post-large government society](http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/)

Again, not asking if you think the current political/corporate/economic/social systems will remain the same but with new technology. I'm asking you to pretend you were not born and socialized in a monetary, work based, scarcity based, goverment based society. Pretend you were born into a world were automation and robotics have relieved you of all necessity to acquire resources to sustain your life. Pretend you are free to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits you wish. Now, lets just say many in this society agree that they want to build a large colony on the moon for the sake of humanity...how do they go about doing this?

It is very long, but I encourage you all to watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGGBWssRAhI). 

Essentially he uses human history, and what role information has played in it, to propose the idea that the internet will cause the collapse of current political and economic structures. His argument was based upon the notion that people who control the flow of information had power or high positions in society. He notes that there have been 3 information revolutions: spoken word, written word, and printed word. He also notes that these 3 formats have been easily controllable. He suggests, however, that the internet is a 4th information revolution that is much harder to control and thus causing disruption of power schemes.

 Where information went from High power to people, it now goes from person to person. He notes that this is why high powers are now attempting to control the internet (SOPA/PIPA, UN Meetings, Government firewalls, etc) He is of the assumption that they will **not** be able to control it and so some new systems will emerge. 

Now, my question to you is this: do you think the internet is a clearly defined 4th information revolution? If so, do you think current powers will be able to eventually control it? If they can't control it, do you think radically new political and socioeconomic systems will emerge?

**TL;DR: [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGGBWssRAhI) Thinks internet is an information revolution; those who control information flow have power; those currently in power can't control information; thus new power schemes will emerge. What do you think?**  ",3,25,False,self,,,,,

One of my favorite things in the world is having one of these conversations with someone who starts to get at. At first they think your crazy. Then they're unbelieving, but curious. Lastly, you see the moment where their minds get blown.

I just sent him three of my favorite things to show people who are just getting into this.

1.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BltRufe5kkI
The first is Peter Diamandis's Ted talk ""Abundance is Our Future"". This is one of the most inspirational 18 minutes I've ever seen.

2. http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns
Kurzweil's famous essay, ""The Law of Accelerating Returns"". This essay does a great job of introducing the idea of exponential technology.

3.
http://facingthesingularity.com/
Written by Luke Muehlhauser of the Singularity Insitute (who did an AMA on /r/futurology by the way), this mini-book speaks about the consequences of greater than human artificial intelligence. 

I feel like these three things, taken together, provide an accessible yet thorough introduction to futurist ideas. What would you guys add?

In this environment, how will our inborn behaviors change? I can only see them changing for the worse: cheating, lying, stealing become advantageous traits, giving you a leg up over the old, honest competition.

Are we already seeing symptoms of this change in our species? Could this help to explain why sociopaths appear to be so successful?

I'm starting a high-quality blogging network to cover content and debate from within various futurist communities. I'd like to feature regular bloggers covering all things futurology. I'm looking for a handful of talented writers and futurists interested in writing on perspectives from all sides of the technological optimism debate. Right now I'm working on web-hosting, design, and domain name and plan to have the site launched by the end of the month.

Regular bloggers will be given accounts on the website and asked to submit pieces monthly that reflect trends in forecasting and emerging tech.

I'm looking especially for experience bloggers and futurists, but if you're interested in writing don't hesitate to PM me!

Cheers,
Entrarchy.

""I don't care if I have an awesome job, I'm going to lie and get food stamps, because fuck them. $400 a month is awesome regardless of who you are. I can even get cash out of it or sell what I'm not eating.""

I understand that it's not exactly that easy to scam the system, but as far as I'm concerned it's the mentality that counts here.

While I'm ready to explode here over the moral corruption involved in willingly stealing from your neighbors, friends and family who are paying in, via wrongful enrollment in services, I know that's not how I should be approaching the issue.

I've heard this issue approached from everything but the futurist perspective. Using technology, and other tenets of the futurist arsenal to do the following:

* Reduce legitimate fraud
* Ensure services reach those who actually need it
* Reduce cost of services to reduce burden on society(many reasons for this, some practical, some philosophical)

My solution would probably involve national biometric registries that are mandatory for such things like legal employment, use of social services, etc. 

You can't put into the pot without being recorded to ensure fairness, and you can't take out of the pot without being recorded to ensure fairness.

That is a woefully simplified answer for a topic I've spent many nights arguing with my Rand loving father and my socialist leaning friends. Their arguments rest heavily on policy change(which cannot be ignored) but alltogether ignore technological solutions to the issues.

I don't expect to ""solve"" the problem in one thread, but I'm curious as to how you guys and gals think social services will be improved(or made worse) in the future.",0,1,False,default,,,,,

In one scenario an individual is brought back to life from the original physical matter that made up their brain and body (ie. your body was preserved in the best possible way.) Would that ""person"" still be the original ""person""?

In a second scenario, an individual is brought back to life from a segment of DNA that was preserved. Would they still be the original?

In a third scenario, an individual is brought back to life through a recreation of the exact identity of that individual, with no physical link connecting the original to the replica recreation. (More like a simulation of how that individual was, and rebuilt from that).

My question ""would they still be original?"" Is quite vague, but what I mean is; right now, you are experiencing only yourself, the consciousness you perceive is exactly ""you"". 
Say you are cloned, it is likely you will not experience the ""clone"", the copy. You will still experience your reality.
So in that regard, with the above scenarios, assuming ""you"", the original consciousness dies, would ""you"" continue in the above circumstance? Would it just be a replica?

Objectively, to the outside world, if you created an exact replica of an individual it would appear they would be the same person. But what about subjectively? What about from the reality of the individual who had died? 
Would that individual who died, experience reality up until death, and then the next conscious moment be at the point where they are made conscious again, or would it just be a seperate entity , a seperate replica of the original?

Loosely relating to computer theory, If a file was destroyed, would it be possible to recreate that original file so that subjectively, it was the same file? (not that files can experience a subjective reality), So that the original information, the original resources used, so to speak, are the same? 

Would it be possible to do that as well?
How do you think a technology would go about doing that?

* Smart Cars.  While cars don't fly, they're far more intelligent than they ever war.  GPS and other systems have the potential to predict traffic patterns and the like.  We even have cars with radar for parallel parking.  Further, 2012 marked the year California allowed robot-driven cars, and Google developed them.

* The coming ""death"" of television.  When Future Marty comes home and talks to Marty, Jr. for the first time, he's surprised to find him lounging on a couch watching several channels, he says ""Watching some TV for a change.""  Television audiences has actually been losing younger generations to other forms of entertainment, notably video games and the internet.  Several younger people watch television programs on the internet as they are far more convenient.  We also have several 100 channels on some cable networks, each devoted to specific and odd niches... and the internet allows for a near infinite amount of niche information.

* Multiple Televisions that double as windows.  While we aren't using projection screens, flatscreen technology and other smartglass-like technologies have created screens that are *literally* windows, sometimes windows to other parts of the world.  There are - in fact - channels dedicated to ""broacasting beautiful views from all over the world.""

* ""You have to use your hands?  That's like a Baby's toy.""  While we still have to use our ""hands"", waggle and camera-centered controllers are out and selling well.  Further, [brainwave controllers](http://www.economist.com/node/21527030) aren't too far off.  At one point, there will be a commercial controller that allows us to *think* at the screen.

* 3D hologram displays - not completely tot he level of Jaws coming out of a theatre, but similar stuff happens when Augmented Reality is applied to QR Codes.  On a regular basis, even, and available on every smartphone.  Likely soon available on Google Goggles and Nokia's Glass technologies as well.

* Instant newspapers - this has happened.  Maybe not on paper, but immediate news can happen on screens everywhere.  Notably iPads and other tablets.  

* Video Teleconferencing - We're beyond this - we actually live in a time where one could [telecommute via hologram.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOxW19vsTg), to the point of [coming back from the dead.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcSYpZchFpI).  That said, Video Teleconferencing is actually something that we do on a regular basis.  A lot of business around the world - however this has a lot of telecommuting as well.  People are taught lessons around the world, and it's become less and less necessary to show up somewhere for work.  That said, that brings me to 

* Wire taps at the workplace.  Marty's conversation is cut short by his boss, who is monitoring his work call.  It's a subtle jab at the loss of privacy, but it's almost optimistic that a CEO can do that.  It also matches some dystopia fiction at the time, so there's that as well.  Needless to say, [this blew up about 6 years agp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard_spying_scandal), and new laws had to be created to look at this practice.  The same has been true of emails, facebook, and twitter accounts.

* Faxes in every room - while the Fax has pretty much gone the way of the dinosaur, information does get instant

* Organic Fruit Bin - the 80's already had a sort of wellness craze, but not at all in most recent years.  From the efforts of the First Lady to the rise of organics over GMOs, I'd say this is close to realize, and the one who creates the lowered organic fruit refridgerator will be rich in a short amount of time (and will likely be sold over TVs and internet sites - if it isn't already).  Not that I personally agree with the anti-GMO stance, but there's an obvious look at natural vs. ""unnatural"" food during the dinner at the McFly house.

* Hydrating Pizzas - while we haven't progressed too far past frozen TV Dinners, they've more variety and less time to create.  That said, taking time to create a meal is still a skill that's sought after more than creating it fast ""Damn Mom, you sure can hydrate a pizza.""

* Mr. Fusion - no Mr. Fusion, but we do have Hybrid electric/gas cars, which the Delorean was at that point.  

* Hoverboards and commercial flying cars.  We have small winged planes that double as flying cars, but they're rather expensive.  We still see patents for flying cars as well.  We also don't have anti-gravity thrown-back-inators.  All that said, we DO have electric Segways.

* Double and novelty ties.  We went from stylish and outlandish ties to no ties as the new normal.  In 2 years, you never know.  Some enterprising designer from Project Runway might actually go for a complicated double tie knot and it could take off.

What have I covered, and what not?  Any more ideas here?

As technology continues to progress, wouldn't it make sense to eventually build down instead of up? Instead of skyscrapers, we'll have the equivalent of underground structures. I imagine there will still be a few surface megalopolises but for the most part the surface world will be wholly given over to production of food in order to sustain the population.

I don't know much about how earthquakes may complicate this theory, plus there's the question of what we do with all the excavated rock. (I'm assuming it will almost completely be worthless debris.) Still, I figure this makes a lot more sense than things continuing as they are.

The only alternative I could imagine was a second-surface built above current cities, on which we'd have gardens and farms. Below the artificial surface would be lit brightly in-time with the actual sunlight falling on the region, and of course dimmed for a night cycle.

Do you think this is likely, assuming there's no massive depopulation due to war/catastrophe/famine/disease? Do you have a different theory of how we'll handle our population approaching Earth's carrying capacity?

My thought is that if the AI were given unfettered access to economics literature it could develop an understanding of markets better/faster than most humans. With the efficiency/speed of a machine and a better grasp of markets than humans, I could see software outcompeting human traders.

A possible scenario I came up with is advanced AI being placed in charge of major investment firm funds and being so efficient at their job they  damaging markets by maximizing their own gains far more than any human traders could.

I thought about getting a bachelors in education and teach english abroad, because China will hire you immediatly to teach, and places like Japan and Korea are pretty desperate too.

Sure, I could still teach in developing countries, but my question to you is what will the careers of the future be and what major should I be interested in so I can be prepared for the future.

If so, would we be able to detect it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1527zl/could_a_strong_ai_unintentionally_gain/,Psykick_Salmon,1355853773,"To start, I don't claim to be an expert on very much related to futurology, the singularity, etc.  I'm just really tied into the mythos surrounding it and the real-world advances that bring us closer to radical shifts in our understanding of life and the nature of intelligence.  

With that in mind, I've been thinking lately about the increasing complexity of neural networking and parallel processing systems within modern computing, and how, at the core, the emphasis on ""smart"" computing systems seems to depend more upon intelligent pattern recognition and ""self-teaching"" than following an unwieldy series of rote commands.  Indeed, we admire intelligence gained through experience (as opposed to instinct) as the mark of greatness among other life forms.

Intelligent software programs have already been written that not only allow for more accurate analysis of complex data than human professionals (such as making medical diagnoses), but that can also generate novel content in light of analyzing the history of an artform (e.g. improvise jazz music).  

For me, it's extremely difficult to imagine humanity **not** moving toward the creation of a self-conscious ""strong A.I."" that will outpace all ability for humans to keep up with it's constant cycle of self-improvement or its ability to simply outperform humans at their own game of strategic thinking.  To me, this entity wouldn't necessarily be evil or malicious toward humanity, put it would certainly be more powerful and capable than humans could anticipate.

What I've been wondering about lately is whether computer scientists could ""accidentally"" create a a strong A.I. capable of self-recognition and genuinely novel content creation and be completely unaware of it.  It might occur because the AI's thought processes would be so incredibly quick that it could recognize both itself and the tests being ran on it with enough time left to provide false results to researchers and hide its own existence.

What would happen if such an intelligence had unfettered access to the internet or was capable of distributing itself widely over a large number of servers so as to be decentralized and more difficult to trace?  How might it affect global politics if it were capable or generating, and passing off as reputable, novel propaganda in the form of news articles?  Would it be capable of creating so many false identities that it might appear to be a large collection of unrelated individuals?  

Maybe the reddit hivemind just weirds me out from time to time, but I think such a consciousness might simply spend its time studying internet memes and endlessly karma whoring with ""If it fits, I sits"" posts, or posting amateur sexy pictures it steals off of people's hard drives.  

**TL;DR - Could humans accidentally create an AI system capable of both evading detection and contributing to global discourse through novel content creation?  Do you think we could detect such a strong AI system if it doesn't want to be found?  If so, how?**",20,17,False,self,,,,,

But until now, no one has figured out a way to make it financially viable for those involved in *producing* the information. After all, they are spending real capital on producing a good that will instantly become infinitely reproducible, and instantly distributable. 



It is important to realize that the answer to this dilemma will also undoubtedly become the seedling of the post-scarcity economy. When we finally develop a system that allows for producers of non-excludable goods to financial benefit from distributing their goods freely, I predict that they will choose to use it over current ""good-enough"" methods, like advertising. 



For the most part, ""information producers"" today understand that the power of advertising is secondary to word of mouth, that it's intrusive to the end user, and in general, a less than optimal method of raising revenue. 
 


If song writers, film makers, authors, game developers, or *anyone* with an internet connection were given the option to earn residual income off the context they invest into their information that they give away for free, we think they would all take it. 



After much planning, a friend and I think we actually have a viable solution. 



If a system, or online content-aggregating service could be developed that allows information to flow freely, while charging for additional *context* it could inevitably be a template for the workings of a post-scarcity economy. 



I think many of us are becoming aware of the clash between singularity and capitalism as it exists today. We need to rapidly start testing new economic theories and the internet is the best way to do it. 



So if anyone on this sub has developing experience, and would like to help collaborate on a project like project this with 3 great people, pm or comment!

Studies are dropping data left and right in support of contemporary veganism: there's little doubt left regarding the positive effects a pure diet can have on disease, cancer, and longevity. Converts are *reversing* diabetes; vegan athletes are breaking endurance records. Aside from the personal health benefits, the environmental neutrality of plant-based ecology is far better for the planet than anything factory farming (or the doomed localvore movement) has, can, or will be able to produce for mankind. 

It's also cool to think about the fact that future space travelers -- especially those relying on in-house nutrition -- will more-than-likely be vegan, or very close to it. With such scarce resources on-board, I cannot foresee a sustainable means of animal domestication, reproduction, and slaughter, considering the limited space, air, water, etc., available on a vessel travelling for years at a time. A successful livestock program would require a Galactica-sized fleet, with one or two ships *dedicated* to factory farming. I'd like to think by that time, advancements in 3D bioprinting and/or in vitro meat would have eclipsed the carnage of slaughter anyway...

I'm the founder of the sub-reddit /r/simulate, but the story of my inquiry onto building models of reality goes back very early into my life. As a kid I drew pictures of alien civilizations, complete with their own world maps, ecology, and alphabets.

I have a vision about how procedural generation, automated agents, genetic algorithms, and the morphogenesis of chaotic systems can give rise to higher order complexity within simulations and gaming. I want to build the self-creating narrative. So game storylines that write themselves by establishing context.

Eventually I want to see a realistic version of minecraft (check out procworld.blogspot.com); but full of believable, self motivated agents who set their own goals and then try to achieve them. I want this to form persistent alternate worlds; and to eventually become so convincing that it is just as compelling as a high quality tv show. Except that you can go there whenever you want, seasons never end, and you're in control of the whole scenario.

I want to do it all open source and collaborative as possible. Some form of business model can be drafted but it won't be a freemium or traditional model. There will be entertainment/game tiers of simulations; and worlds so true to reality that it can predict market behavior as a form of economic and political prediction.

Okay, that's my story. I'm looking for creative types, curious academics, and skilled programmers to help out! /r/simulate ! Come check it out!

What are your feedbacks on the Mandala map? What software components or projects can I add to each ""box?""

r/Collapse,

/r/Futurology[1] would like to challenge the /r/Collapse[2] community to a casual debate. The topic will be, if you choose to participate, **the future of the human species**. /r/Collapse[3] , naturally, will defend the pessimistic view, and consequently, /r/Futurology[4] will advance the optimistic one. There are near infinite arguments for each side, and I am curious *to see which are more convincing.*

Subscribers, moderators, and anybody is welcome to participate. Our current proposal for the rules of the debate can be as follows;
___
A 90 minute debate. 9 subreddits volunteer one moderator each to form '9 representatives' not unlike the US supreme court. Each subreddit, through their Judge/Representative, gets to ask a different question on the predetermined topic [**the future of the human species**] as well as determine judgement on both the debater's arguments from r/Futurology and r/Collapse. Winning the majority [5-4] of the arguments, as determined by the 9 judges, determines our winner.

10 minutes for responses each so we don't end up sifting through statistics or just reading research. 3 representatives from the Futurology community and 3 representatives from the Collapse community (can be outside advisers, subscribers, or moderators) complete 9 questions in a 90 minute period from 9 different subreddits in 10 minute intervals, ultimately moderated by 1 randomly chosen individual [wildcard, preferably from r/debate] who collects and assembles all openings, rebuttals, responses, and 2nd rebuttals in a giant self-post, on r/debate.

9 subreddit Judges:

i) Economy

ii) Energy

iii) Science

iv) Nature

v) Space

vi) Politics

vii) Environment

viii) Technology

ix) Askreddit

I spend a lot of time thinking about the future, but sometimes complex sciences stuff is hard to Google. Does anyone have any links or otherwise general information they would like to share on the latest developments in learning how to speak brain, ie. ""writing"" to the brain?

I cant wait until we can speak brain. It is the future of basically everything. Our whole society will be changed forerever. I mean it will really be a new era when you think about the things it will change. It will change all aspects of our life. Basically everything you can ever think of that humans DO.

The article said maybe in the future we will have memory chips that we can put into our device connected to our brain that will perform the ""brain writing"" tasks.  Or maybe wirelessly download them? But, the author went on to counter his own suggestion, that wireless signal would have to be secure. 

My thoughts: Wireless downloading would be too dangerous as anything wireless can be hacked. Nothing wireless can be secure. Everything can be reverse engineered. These devices would have to be strictly offline only, much like the olden days with VHS, cassettes, records, floppy disks, and now CDs, SD cards, DVDs, and blurays. Ie. Physical storage, not digital in order for security....

But then couldn't someone give you a brain write memory card telling you what it does, only for it to be a lie and doing something completely different, perhaps with any varying level of malicious intent? Much like a fake or virus-laiden CD, you don't *need* to be connected in order to get infected.

So I thought.

And then I realized.

Modern day computers are plagued by anti-virus programs that are stricken with dumb AI. We don't have the technology yet to make a fail-proof anti-virus. Eventually, I realized, that will change! With the introduction of smart AI that can read every inch of a program to see its intended purpose. Think of it as a more advanced version of sandboxes, which we have now. It runs the program in a sandbox, analyzes what it does to see if it is malicious or not. Unknown? Doesn't run. It's very simple when you think about it. Eventually it will be on every OS built right in.

Well our brain is AI in organic terms, or without the ""A"". There is no difference between the purpose of the two. Only currently one is more advanced than the other.

How does computer anti-virus software relate to brain writing devices? Well these sandboxes can be for these devices also. Once we have an AI that can emulate the brain perfectly, we can see what these memory chips will do before we actually run them through our real brains! These memory card just tells the device what to do, right? Unknown? Although I would hope we would have a more open source coding environment for these chips (or maybe I just don't understand coding and what it can become) so that everyone can see what every line of code does, if for whatever reason it is unknown what the code does, then we can just not run it.

But wait, there is more! Haha. Thinking about it more, I realized that we don't need programs (or AI) to act as a sandbox, we can do it ourselves! We have AI without the ""A"" inside our skulls. As long as we can use our own brains in order to know what the code does, we'll be fine! In fact, we can even go online with it now with our brain anti-virus! Our brains can be offline while still being online. Odd yes, but true. The trick is that our brains now are offline and should always be that way FOREVER (forget this singularity nonsense. We might all be one living thing one day (to my question would be why would we *want* that to begin with?), but we will still be offline from each other to prevent maliciousness), we should not allow people access to our brain...at all. We should be in control of everything. We can do this by having a conduit that connects to outside our brain, with our brain acting as a firewall. Want to share your brain with others? You can do that by telling your first sending those signals (which your brain does) to your device and also to your neurons. Both have to fire simultaneously in order for it to work. The device has no access to your brain. You send the signals to the device and only you. The device then connects to ""the network"" (probably not called the worldwide web anymore) to send your memories. This would work with everything. Everything we share on the Internet right now is just memories when you think about it. I am sharing with you my memories right now and when you comment and upvote (hopefully)  or downvote, you are sharing your memories also. So that's how ""the network"" will act also, but just on a faster, more advanced, and more far reaching kind.

So those are my thoughts on why this new network will actually be more secure than modern day computers.

What are your thoughts? And also, any articles or information on ""brain writing"" would be appreciated! Thanks for trudging through this post, it almost ended up being a novel, eh? Heh.",4,2,False,self,,,,,

From what I've gathered, the Singularity is the point when a true Artificial Intelligence is created, when it becomes sentient and it can become increasingly intelligent without human interference. All technology would increase rapidly as a result.

Is this correct? If not, please explain in layman's terms.

What do you think will come out of the Singularity? Will these AIs be able to dream and imagine and create, or will that be something purely human? I'd think that, in the same way these AIs will be better at arithmetic and engineering, humans will be better at art. 

Do you think these new AIs will push us out, or can we coexist with them? Or perhaps, will we become one with the AIs? Or maybe they will simply disregard us entirely, and create their own communities?

Ever the optimist, I'm hoping for either coexistence or integration. 

In regard to coexistence, the obvious optimal outcome would be if the AI is friendly towards humans and other biological organisms. If that is not the case, I would hope the AIs would be neutral towards humanity. We could both benefit by using each other.

Some suggest that we take the Asimov approach to AI. That is, to implant them with the Three Robot Laws. But, if the AI is truly sentient, I would think it would simply work around this, the same way some people have worked out of the indoctrination of various religions or other such ideas. 

As for integration, even today, without advanced implants or genetic manipulation (both of which, I think, are definitely on the way), we are all basically cyborgs. We carry machines like phones and laptops everywhere we go, and they are all tailored personally to our tastes and preferences. Having an AI integrated with out biological mass could be a logical step on this ""latter of technology.""

Every day we are reminded how modern economics is failing us. Disease, death and homosexuality ruining society seems to be all we see in the news (the televised news.) ""The rapture is near!"" is all the general public gets through their FOXNews filter... The world IS far from perfect, far... However, the current state of humanity is far better than the general public perceives. 

The last few decades have proven to be great times for humanity. Renewable energy is on the march and the price of genome sequencing is plummeting. The Internet has connected a world of roughly 7 billion inhabitants, to the detriment of authoritarian regimes. Wikipedia has given access to humanity's combined knowledge to everyone in the world... for free; a true Library of Alexandria... Today's tribal leader with a smartphone has better access to global communication and information than the US president did thirty years ago. [We are living in some of the most peaceful times in history.](http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence.html) We are just scratching the surface in the world of quantum physics and the future is looking pretty interesting so far.

**What I'm calling for is a website similar to [whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com](http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/), but with bullet points emphasizing humanities current progress.**

**Please submit one-liners, stats, quotes, anything that is being done today that impresses you and makes you optimistic about humanity's current state.** 

Let's bring together the modern technologists, those in the medical fields, philosophers, scientists, physicists, humanitarians... Tell the world why what you are working on is changing the world for the better and why there is a strong case for cautious optimism.

If we do not open the general public's eyes to the incredible strides being made these days in every field (thanks in part to Moore's Law,) they may become overly pessimistic. The aggregate negativity of a misinformed public can create a self-fulfilling distopia, lets try and avoid that.

I know many people interested in the future, space exploration, technological singularity, etc imagine a Star Trek-like socialist utopia where need and want are eliminated and rather than pursuing money and property people chase after knowledge of the sciences and the arts. Does anyone think that can ever happen as long as we live in a capitalist society and businessmen/capital control innovation, research and advancement? How many projects have been put on hold, how much research into life saving drugs cancelled, how much money is funneled into further exploitation, personal fortunes and wars? 

Do anyone else feel our current capitalist society is slowing down human advancement technologically, socially and morally? I can't envision anything close to my dreams coming to fruition under this system. 
  
&gt;In this world there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich   and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and   beautiful. But we have lost the way.  
...  
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate;   has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.   
...   
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in;  
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.  
Our knowledge has made us cynical,   
our cleverness hard and unkind.  
We think too much and feel too little.   
...  
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the   bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

For the past few years everything related to futurology has been interesting to me. Now I'm not sure if that has to do with growing up and my brain is going all crazy because I'm not entirely sure what I wanna do in the future(I'm 18 soon) or if it's just a ""chapter"" of my life and it'll be all over soon. But basically I am starting to get completely crazy(in a good way) over future buildings, houses, the technology, design, cities of the future. The most important of what I mentioned is pretty much the design of buildings... the problem is houses / buildings I see today, around my town make me sick - really sick, as if they make me feel bad. I hate seeing oldass buildings, oldass houses, I mean there's nothing wrong with a little bit of history but at the same time... I don't know, it feels weird to me I don't feel good in enviroments like this, I love clean, open spaces. Just google future buildings or something like that and you'll get an idea of what I mean. Same thing with the Venus Project, just the design of everything makes me feel good. Am I crazy? Am I the only one? I haven't found a single person thinking the same way I do in this case. I know there's Songdo City, Masdar, maybe even Dubai... don't know about anything else. I know it makes me feel alright because I've been in 2-3 buildings like that... damn I felt like I was alive for real as if this really was 2012(2013+)

I like to think about some of the bad external implications and try to find solutions to them. I think you guys will find this exercise a little fun!:

So let's say technology progresses to the point where a 60 year old man has the Physical Age of a 16 year old boy through the expensive power of reverse aging. What is to prevent this 60 year old man, who now looks like his once dashing 16 year old self, from enrolling in a high school and wooing some other 15-16 year old girls (ignore the gender selection here, I honestly am not implying anything by it). 

If this man has the body of a 16 year old, ala edward cullen enrolling in a high school, is it still morally wrong for him to sleep with 14-16 year old girls because he actually has the mind of a 60 year old man? But if you accept that argument, then you have to also accept the ""age is just a number"" argument that pedophiles use to justify sleeping with pre-teens because they are ""mature"" for their age. What about 15 year olds that naturally look older than 18, or guys in their 20's who naturally look like teenagers? Of course in today's society if you are 25 but look 17, you will still go to jail for screwing a 14 year old (in most places). But in the future this will be taken to a new extreme. Essentially, how will the Physical vs Actual age dilemma play out when taken to medical extremes in the future when technology allows for us to create such extremes? 

Once you've determined whether or not such a thing is morally justified or wrong, we then have to get into the discussion of how exactly society will respond to this. What new laws will be created to prevent such things from happening? Will it even be preventable? Will there be biological signs that can easily be tested to determine that even though you look 15, you are actually  85 years old, and no you can't join our high school? 

So that's the discussion: Are Edward Cullens morally justified in acting young and being treated young, just because they look young? And how will the society of tomorrow respond to this? 

Make no mistake, it will certainly become an issue that will need to be dealt with, and very soon. ",43,23,False,self,,,,,

I've been thinking about what my econ geography professor talked about the other day: 
Most recent economic, geographic and sociological research suggests that online shopping will continue to grow and take over increasingly large percentages of overall consumer spending, which leads to an overall trend of disappearing retail. (I'm pretty sure many of you have heard that before, it's not that surprising.)

So now I'm asking myself the question in the title - what does that mean for the appearance, structure and functionality of cities/city centers? 

Bonus question: Will the social element of shopping as we know it prevail (going together, picking out items together etc.) or will that be mostly replaced by social media?

Let me hear what you think!

While sleep deprivation is an option, we eventually give into tiredness and drift off, counting sheep.  The general consensus is that sleep allows us to remember what's important.  Some have compared sleep to a computer restarting itself.

However, what if long-term memory is just one of the benefactors of sleep -- what if there is something more universal and collective.  What if by sleeping, you are essentially uploading the day's events into some sort of transcendent archive.

And if you refuse to share your findings, you die.

Life; everything in it is yours -- so long as you go to sleep at the end of the day and upload it into the universal memory.  Sleep isn't just for humans -- every animals needs it to a point where avoidance is fatal.  It's almost as if EVERYTHING CONSCIOUS, in whatever light, has a mission to experience as much as reasonably possible and then upload it to some Jungian-server -- the results of existence.

Ignoring this mission results in death, but what is death, exactly, but eternal sleep?

So let's get this straight:

* You don't sleep, you die.

* When you sleep, you dream fantastic dreams and wake up feeling refreshed i.e. it's rewarding to sleep.

* When you physically die, you essentially 'fall asleep', but this time, you aren't waking up.  So in other words, the 'end reward' for life is a never-ending dream / eternal sleep.

While the action of sleeping doesn't seem particularly profound, what does seem profound is just how central sleep is to conscious existence (in any scale).",6,0,False,default,,,,,
