**Basic income** (common definition) 

Rather than having welfare, unemployment, food stamps, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. A single check is handed out to all qualifying individuals. Qualifying individuals are individuals whose households cannot afford the basic standard of living.

Obviously, households with more dependents would have a lower qualifying income threshold. This has the benefits of a UBI but avoids giving checks to the rich. 

Individuals can choose purchase items that are best suited for them. An older individual would spend more on health coverage and his grandkids, while a younger individual might invest in her education startup. 

Jobs are disappearing. Basic incomes are inevitable. Giving money to the rich is just stupid. ",11,0

In a future where what we see and experience is as much virtual as real could we choose how we live digitally.

For instance...

People who believe all women should be covered could live in an AR world that Burka's all women they see.

Or people that want to experience a Star War / Cyberpunk / WOW overlay of reality could do so.

People that choose to pay minimum taxes to the government could do that knowing they will get minimum service provision and have to pay privately for everything.

People that choose to pay higher taxes to get maximum service provision could choose that option.

Even legal aspects of life could be virtualised allowing people to choose as much or as little freedom as they wish to pay for.

This of course can only fully work if we have maximised our automation of the legal and government systems and services.

So in a fully digital automated future do we still need politics?

This from Macro-Strategy Partners: 

The power of liquidity in driving markets is no more apparent than in tech, where the equity markets are pricing stocks at bubble levels despite a collapse in tech productivity, despite clear signs of a downturn in their major source of profits (advertising) and despite a zero-sum content escalation war. 

At MacroStrategy we see it as a great irony that the second major tech boom in our generation is taking place at the exact time that a breakdown in Moores law, Dennard scaling &amp; Kryders law is undermining the entire premise behind the fourth industrial revolution. 

In this note Ill explain why the next tech bust may coincide with a self-reinforcing collapse in advertising. When productivity &amp; the capital stock is growing, advertising is a fundamental driver of increased value. When productivity is falling, advertising becomes just another cost to be cut in a race to the bottom. Witness Unilevers 17% reduction ad spend in H1 this year. 

Bitcoin is the posterchild of Tech bubble 2.0. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Transaction costs are averaging 28,500x those of Visa, and transaction clearance times average 1.1m times longer, with a 20% failure rate. As my colleague Andy Lees has argued it is totally non-viable as a currency, and is nothing more than a speculative instrument. 

When global US$ liquidity starts to tighten on a sustained basis (I anticipate that the next leg of tightening will start in early-mid December), I expect Bitcoin to go the way of Pets.com. It will likely lead a 2001 style tech de-rating. ",3,3

It's really hard for me to cope with the fact that me and everyone that I had known and loved will die someday, and the earth and the universe may not exist anymore. I really want to see the life of human and other species going on forever.

Then have a powerful personal assistant for kids and adults with the device recognising the person using it.

Have access to internet content from videos to free music on youtube or a multitude of internet based searches. If a kid asked about wolves the ai could search and determine the best video on youtube to play depending on the age of the logged on user.

Surely a basic ai could do this, you would not need anything big.

But for this topic, I want to know what your thoughts are if you humor the idea that it is possible, and something everyone would receive as freely as vaccines. Some example topics, please feel free to think of more: 

1. If you are struggling with the idea of living forever as a 25 year old human being, how would you then think about having children, if you yourself would struggle with existence? Chances are you would give that behavior to your children, no? What about diseases that run in your family, or the child's eternal struggle to make a living because you couldn't be happy without a child? 
2. How would you decide who to spend your life with? Because given eternity with eternal youth your plastic surgery won't ""go bad"", so everyone will be a 10 out of 10 in attractiveness eventually. So what would you then use to decide who to want to spend time with? (time being anything up to eternity until you no longer remember ever being apart, so your relationship has no beginning, and no end). 
3. What purpose would work have? Would you consider the purpose of work to become self-sufficient so that you no longer HAVE to work, but can do whatever you want to do, or would you consider work a necessary evil (or good thing) in order to accomplish something else? What would your economic thinking be, with eternal youth. I can mention that my friends all think ""spend money while you're young"", but if you just invest and save up for half a century you can REALLY get spending while everyone who thought short-term are struggling with a 9 to 5 job because they never saved up anything. 

Thoughts? I really want to know what your first intuition is, write that down and post it please. Then I would be extremely interested to read your next comment if you come back to this topic in a week when you have thought about it. 

PS: overpopulation, resource shortage, climate change etc, is off topic. Think selfishly assuming these things will be solved. ",64,13

I believe that everybody should be able to recognize that if you look at what it is, transhumanism represent mankinds desire to escape the human condition.

Transhumanism is the religion of many atheists, much is about upgrades. Physically or intellectually. 
But if you listen to the transhumanists, they say that eventually you'll be able to upload your soul or consciousness to a computer. 
And at that stage you'll basically be able to decide how you'd like to live, how long you'd like to live but also the rules that would be surrounding you.


What we have in modern times, is a species with [less than 5% of active DNA](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/24/10-percent-human-dna-functional-genome-biological-baggage), indoctrinated into using only the left half of their brain, that exists [in a debt-based society.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nBPN-MKefA)

In which every single person within it, is required to pay to live in what is essentially temporary accomodation. As our modern day consumerist society build very little, but is actually designed to last.

Whether they are truly aware of it or not, modern human beings live their entire adult life in a [largely unnoticed system of slavery.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbp6umQT58A)
And this can easily be seen when one truly [absorbs the implications of paper being more important than people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOkrPfO8c1Q)
Now imagine taking this one step further and having each person locked into a digital world, in which it would be an easy task to permanently lock human consciousness into a completely false reality, enslaved into a state of permanent debt forever.
If you question your captives or refuse to work, if you decide you would be better off free... what then?
Transhumanism may well be presented to the world as a method of improving mankind. Yet the question must be asked, in a corporate controlled world, exactly what constitutes an improvement?
Because looking at things from a commercial and corporate perspective, what may be seen as an improvement to one class, may in fact be severely detrimental to another.



The field of synthetic biology is a new frontier of science, using nanotechnology its goals are to improve and transcend the limit of nature.
Human enhancement is being sold to us as leaving tall buildings in a single bound and having better, faster, higher intelligent and perfect health.
But all of that is the sales pitch, enhancement may in fact be degradation. Our being devolved to someone else's specifications.

For instance, a specimen that can work 18 hours a day;[a specimen that is sterile](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/31/539517210/sperm-counts-plummet-in-western-men-study-finds); that will never have the responsibility of caring for others. 
A specimen that is even tempered with a narrow predictable range of expression. All this is enhanced - improved.


We certainly do have a propensity to do that. To wait until the last minute before doing what we should be doing all along.
I mean we certainly tend to do it in our lives, we put off the things that we most want to do in life because we put all these barriers there and these limitations on ourselves so we never really get to do them.
But we also tend to have this approach in regard to the world we live in aswell, most especially when you look at the system.
When you look at the system that controls us, we've seen this system, we've been watching this slavery system come online for so many years now and everybody sort of thinks it's okay because it's not as bad as they thought it was going to get quite yet...
So nobody really wants to do something about it when really the best action we could've taken would be to do something about it all along. But we didn't know it was coming so it's understandable.

It was the totalitarian tiptoe for a while, it was a slowly encroaching slavery system. But it really seems to be ramping up very much in the last couple of years and it's just getting more and more in your face, no matter how you look at it.
And really  it's a result of us waiting till the last minute to fix things when we should be addressing problems at their root when they first manifest.


Anyways, what I'm referring to is [the 5G grid system and the Internet of Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY3CVNxWwVs) which is being rolled out right beneath our feet. It's being rolled out to people under the guise of giving them faster downloads and more efficient internet access.

[Next year in Germany](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609322/the-worlds-tallest-wind-turbines-will-store-power-in-a-huge-water-battery/), a wind project will deploy four turbines with a mast height of 580 feet (177 meters) and blade tips that will reach over 800 feet (&gt; 244 meters) at the zenith of their cycle.

The reason this is happening is twofold: Air flow at greater heights above ground level is smoother and more consistent, and longer blade lengths moving slowly are more efficient over the lifetime of the system than shorter ones moving quickly (partly due to wear and tear, since a turbine is a moving system).

This project strikes me as interesting because the masts are nearly double the height of the Statue of Liberty (pedestal included), and the maximum blade altitude AGL is just short of the Eiffel Tower.  Moreover, the project isn't even particularly ambitious - it's just one more milestone in a process that has drastically increased the sizes and heights involved.  The current tallest is about 200 feet (~60 meters) shorter than the new project, so that's quite a leap in a short time.

Moreover, wind turbine masts are structurally much simpler than something like a skyscraper, so can theoretically reach much greater heights at much lower costs and with much greater durability.  

Now, wind turbines are still nowhere near being the tallest structures on Earth.  The current record-holder is the Burj Khalifa at about 2,700 feet (&gt; 800 meters).  With the new project, the blade-tip at maximum height will be less than a third of that, but wind projects continue to push the boundaries in major increments while the growth in skyscraper heights is limited by a lot of different factors (the real estate market, raw materials, conspicuous consumption, etc.).

It is therefore conceivable that in following decades, some particularly ambitious wind turbine projects may exceed the height of whatever the tallest building at the time is, and may even keep going beyond that.  As thin as Earth's atmosphere is relative to its radius as a planet, it's *huge* compared to the layer in which human structures are currently built, and most of it flows powerfully and smoothly - energy waiting to be tapped.

There are complications, of course - particularly in terms of demand, as solar is also growing explosively, and will eventually come into direct competition with wind once they've both disposed of fossil fuel energy sources.  But this is a fun possibility to think about.

We need to adapt the pragmatism of the US authorities regarding the human experiments of Unit 731.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731

The Japanese doctors who performed human experiments were not punished, and were treated very well. They all became respected pillars of Japanese medicine, and died rich and famous.

Not punishing them was a utilitarian method. Their results were too valuable to be thrown away, and sparing them and making them contribute to Civilization was more beneficial. Besides, the victims were mostly Chinese and other races not considered essential for Civilization, so who cared?

Such kind of attitude should be adopted to facilitate transhumanism and Singularity. 

Unlimited human experiments should be allowed, with no legal consequences or compensation for the experiments which might , and will, go sour. The more ethics and other delays take place, the less chance we will enter Civilization 2.0.

Elsewhere I argued that wages should be reduced to $2/day like Gina Reinhart proposed, and compensation to workplace injuries/death should be limited to $1,200/person, like the Triangle shirt factory fire's victims back in 1911, so there would be more profits to be invested for the future tech. I also proposed totalitarianism for the non-essential people, so they won't spend too much resources which might be better used to build future techs.

(my english is not perfect)

I've seen a patern within technosocial paradigms (I mean, main technologies with the ability to change society and, at the same time, used by almost every person) since the Web... There're three phases of adoption and perfection of the tech:

3-4 Years of Early Adoption (A1): the product isn't good and it's very expensive, only a few milions buy it.

4-5 Years of Mass Adoption (A2): the product gets good enough to mainstream adoption, it becomes cheaper and better so a vast majority buys it.

2 Years of Technological Plateau (A3): there are no more major innovations and the product is almost perfect and impossible to improve. Almost everybody uses it and the society as a whole is absolutely affected by it.

Yes, I'm talking about the famous [S curve](https://hvelleca.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/s-curve.gif)... First, I thought ""why 10 years if technology is exponential?"" So maybe I'm wrong about further predictions but, what if it's not about the time but about the tech itself? I mean, the next tech is exponetially better even if the curve lasts the same amount of time... I hope I'm wrong, but that's just my intuition...

Lets begin, I'll need your help to know if I'm wrong or right so, if you can remember how things were back in time, please, help me to correct and improve this post :) (Note, this is for developed countries, sadly, other humans suffer a tech delay because of X causes...)

[THE WEB](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/163217021356422E9607F90E222DA2A1.jpg):

A1 1996-2001: Internet becomes more and more popular but just a few millions use it and connections are very rudimental, limited by time and bandwitch etc.

A2 2001-2005: Connections get fast, cheaper and web 2.0 makes everything better. Google, Facebook, Youtube become more popular and full of new services. More than 70% of people use internet.

A3 2005-2007: Adoption stabilizes around 75%, a lot of new services have born and been perfected.

*Note: I know it's very unfair to consider Web has reached tech limits by 2007 but in my mind it makes sense xD*

[THE SMARTPHONE](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEfuryTUUAE_6cO.png):

A1 2007-2011: I guess everybody remember first iPhone's keynote, I don't like Apple but they did it very well, puting BB like a nice try but not enough for what we could do with this tech. 

A2 2011-2015: this tech gets better, with better screens, cameras, sensors, sizes, uses etc. 

A3 2015-2017: we all know smartphones have reached tech limits, iPhoneX is the proof, after a few years of no major improvements we've started dreaming about the next big thing...

***

MIXED REALITY:

A1 2016-2020: I know Oculus and Google started with AR and VR back in 2010-2011 but that was a development phase, we had to wait for 2016 for a consumer product for VR and still we're waiting for a decent AR one, maybe Magic Leap will do something about this by the next year. Hololens consumer version came this year, even if devs had it in 2016. There are more MR products from MS, HTC etc., of course.

A2 2020-2025: I think VR resolution and GPU power will become cheaper enough to allow a very good experience and even displace monitors and other productivity screens. At least if Moore's Law keeps alive in other way (optical-3D-Cloud-5G... computing). This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs) seems very possible to me by this time... Plus, battery tech could have evolved to next gen etc. I don't want to do the math about FLOPS, miniaturization etc., I don't like numbers sorry xD

A3 2025-2027: it's very likely that everybody wears glasses by this time, I know it seems absurd (and very hipster) but if could asked some guy by the 2000s that everybody will look at tiny screens from their pockets while walking on the street and in the metro, in just 10 years, you know what I mean... Damn, and even pay things with you fingerprint! A lot of social, consumer and work activity (if jobs still exist) will take place in VR/AR places. But, we need [something more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z37cjUWxOEQ) isn't it? We are humans.

***

NEURAL LINK:

A1 2027-2030: this is starting to sound very crazy but consider this tech already exists. Today we can connect the human brain to computers and even other brains, its very rudimental but promising enough to induce Elon Musk to create ""Neuralink"" a company hoping to connect the human brain to the cloud/internet/other people with neural implants by 2027 [(that's literally the goal)](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/21/15370376/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-ai-implant-neuroscience). Sorry guys, but I can't imagine other paradigm before this one, I feel it's the next logical step and, Moore's Law by our side, it's congruent.

A2 2030-2035: maybe thanks to some short of nanotech, with or without surjery, almost everybody will get his/her neuralink. Why? Isn't dangerous? Can I get a virus and die? Well, I repeat what I said before, now we can't imagine allowing ourselves to do this kind of crazy things, but time goes on and minds change, people will accept it. There will be dangers, of course, but it will worth the risk: what about becoming Einstein? what about Matrix-like VR? what about...

A3 2035-2037: everybody is neuro-connected and max bandwitch achieved.

418,2017-11-6,2017,11,6,10,7b1rqy,I've been thinking [in-depth] about how to protect against evil Artificial Intelligence and would love to hear some thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7b1rqy/ive_been_thinking_indepth_about_how_to_protect/,doorwindowtable,1509930265,"Background: I'm a philosophy and computer science double major in my last year of college.

I hope this is the right subreddit to be posting this in. I might also post something in a r/philosophy and Quora so I apologize in advance if this isn't your first time seeing this. So here is the SparkNotes version of my thought process. 

A common theme portrayed in science fiction is that AI was designed not to harm people and then either it becomes too intelligent and finds a loophole in its protocol in order to act against the wishes of its creator or it thinks it is acting in line with its creator's wishes, but this results in some horrible acts. 

These scenarios bring up some valid points in the safe AI problem. It is seemingly impossible to predict every scenario the AI will ever be in and program laws that prevent it from making decisions we don't want it to. 

This has me thinking that the only way to get around this problem would be to somehow impart a sense of ethics onto the AI. However, in order to achieve the goal, the AI can't simply calculate the value of a decision (this could result in simply choosing to ignore this calculation). It seems like the AI would actually have to 'feel' the emotion behind the ethical choices in order for us to be at least somewhat confident that when it encounters an unforeseeable scenario, it makes the choice we would hope it makes. 

Okay, if you're still with me, congratulations, here's where I think it gets really interesting.  The question now is how do you program something to feel? As far as I understand, neural networks should be able to approximate every single possible function if given enough computing power, time, and data. So then the question becomes what is the data? 

Okay, so machine learning requires an algorithm to learn based on input data points. But, what are the measurable data points for inputs to the neural network? Self-reported emotional states from humans? That seems inaccurate and vague. Hormone levels? This would probably give us a very small picture of the emotions being felt. If anyone has other possibilities or more knowledge about neurochemistry, maybe you can explain better than I can about how accurate or inaccurate measuring emotion in this way would be. 

In addition, I'm curious to hear how people think a function approximating the relationship between stimuli and however we choose to measure the emotional state would compare to current models of the emotions in philosophy (Like cognitivist models, perceptual models, neo-Jamesian account, etc.). And if having this function is even enough to say the AI is 'feeling' as opposed to just using the function analytically and thus still prone to the problems non-emotive AI.

**tl;dr:** 
- AI with rules sufficient to ensure it doesn't do bad stuff is impossible.
- AI needs a sense of ethics.
- AI needs to actually 'feel' emotions in order to learn ethics, otherwise, it's basically like having another rule to circumnavigate.
- Can the current AI paradigm of unsupervised learning produce a function that maps circumstance to emotion? 
- If said function existed, would simply applying it to the decision-making process of an AI be sufficient to say the AI is 'feeling emotion'?",20,3

&gt; Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasksas, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chesswith great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.

So right off the bat, the claim that various developments in AI are *not* AI are false and are actually examples of the [AI Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect) in action. I.e., 'deep learning AI accomplishes task' leads to comments such as ""This isn't AI, this is just a Monte Carlo Tree Search/data mining algorithm/decision tree"" (all of which *are* objectively forms of AI).

The complication is not on those saying these things, however. The problem arose when newsblogs and clickbait began using ""AI"" in the colloquial sense, which makes it sound like your spam filter is about to hack our nuclear launch codes.

Likewise, there is a difference between AI and any algorithmic code. Your calculator is not AI; calculation itself is not intelligence. Intelligence seems to revolve around application of calculations in some form or another, whether that be consciously or unconsciously. 

So let's talk about that. When we say ""AI"", what do we mean?

At its most basic, AI seems to mean ""any computer that acts like it is alive."" But that's too simple and prone to both hype mongering and fear mongering. It's through that definition that we get the perception that DeepMind is working with living computers. To be fair, it's the media that's responsible for this most of all Elon Musk never actually said that AI is an evil invention or that it absolutely will destroy us, but the media knows that demands for caution and cautious optimism doesn't generate clicks so they focus on statements like ""AI is Summoning the Demon"" while using the T-1000 in article headers when Musk is actually discussing how improperly taught future AIs could make terrible mistakes and that we need to have better protocols for designing and teaching them.

After that, there's two designations for AI that we all know:

**Strong AI** and **Weak AI**.

However, there are two equivalent terms. **General AI** and **Narrow AI**.


My intention with this post is to completely separate the two, because I feel that will allow for greater accuracy when discussing AI development.

Strong AI typically means AI that is about as intelligent or capable as a human, whereas weak AI means AI that is subhuman in capability. But when these are used, they're used as synonyms for general AI (AI that can learn and specialize in anything) and narrow AI (AI that can only learn or specialize in one domain). 

I feel this is inaccurate. AI strength should apply to both general and narrow AI. Furthermore, I feel that we need a designation for the type of AI that falls in between the two.

For example: if I were to talk about a ""**weak narrow AI**"", what do you think I'd be referring to? I'd be referring to the likes of Siri it's a voice-recognition AI that [currently has subhuman natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_in_artificial_intelligence).


A **strong narrow AI** is something closer to what we see with DeepMind. AlphaGo Zero, for example, is obviously a strong AI. It possesses superhuman capabilities so astounding that it's led to a minor philosophical high among Go players but it's superhuman only in one field: playing Go. 

What's different between Siri and AlphaGo Zero is *how* they operate as narrow AIs. It's almost like the intelligence difference between a Turing incomplete and a Turing complete computer in a manner if you wiped all of Siri's memory and tried to make it learn how to identify cats, you would fail. Its learning matricies just cannot handle anything besides voice recognition. It was hardcoded as an NLP machine. It uses machine learning to increase its accuracy and capabilities in that domain, but it was always meant to be used for that purpose.

AlphaGo Zero, on the other hand (AFAIK), is based on a general-purpose learning network. So if you scrubbed its memory and taught it how to identify cats, it would become a master at identifying cats but that particular domain would never be able to play Go again unless the memory was wiped once more.

They're narrow in that they can only do one task. But if there were enough humans, Siri could be replaced by human workers and you'd see a superior service. You wouldn't see anything even remotely close to what AlphaGo Zero can do.


What about **weak general AI**? Right now, we have no general AI. But just as I implied with narrow AI, general AI can be weak or strong as well. Weak AGI means that the network can learn anything or at least many things, but it is not par human or superhuman. 

**Strong general AI** is what we're waiting for and it slides right into **artificial superintelligence** once you add enough power. This is AI that is par human and superhuman in strength.

I've seen some begin to refer to narrow AI as ""vertical AI"", and perhaps that is a pretty accurate way to put it incidentally, that's how deep learning works. You get a machine learning algorithm that parses through data in different vertical layers, getting deeper as you go along. 

I mentioned earlier that I believe there's a fuzzy area in between narrow and general AI. This because I feel that the proper path towards AGI is through ""cluster"" or ""meta"" neural networks. That is to say, neural networks of neural networks. 

Because what would you call an AI that's capable in multiple domains? It's not explicitly narrow perhaps it can recognize animals *and* understand natural language. But it's not general AI because it can't learn just anything; only things within a singular (if wide) field. It's like an AI composed of a cluster of narrow AIs to achieve a more generalized matrix than what was previously possible. DeepMind might be closest to this. Right now, we've not seen any AI that can actually 'remember' what it's done, nor do we have an AI that can transfer what it learned in one domain to another. That's why an AI that mastered Atari Breakout will absolutely fail if it tries to play Arkanoid, even though they're so similar. This hypothetical middle-ground AI wouldn't just be able to play two similar Atari games after learning how to play one; it could theoretically learn how to play just about *any video game*. Bonus points if it can read the instruction manual/site instructions.

It's something like ""less-narrow AI"", and I haven't been able to find a decent word to describe it.


So to recap:

**Weak ANI**: single-purpose AI that is subhuman or barely par-human in specific circumstances. Could either be hardcoded as a narrow AI or a general-purpose AI that can only be taught one singular task.

**Strong ANI**: Single-purpose AI that is par-human or superhuman.

**Intermediate AI**: Multi-purpose AI that can learn to master multiple domains. It's the bridge between narrow AI and general AI, the tier where AI can draw from multiple experiences in one subject and apply those experiences to another subject to enhance learning.

**Weak AGI**: General-purpose AI that is subhuman or barely par-human in specific circumstances. This may be the scariest since it's AI that will have the ability to understand how to do just about anything (i.e. Natural Language Understanding to know that it needs to create paperclips as well as intelligently allocating resources to make said paperclips) but it won't be strong enough to understand why it shouldn't do some things. We may see something like this within the next ten years if currently progress keeps up. It's also possible that this will be indistinguishable from the aforementioned intermediate AI.

**Strong AGI**: The form of AGI we're most familiar with in Hollywood. General-purpose AI that is as smart as, if not smarter than, mature humans. It may or may not be ""conscious"". 

**ASI**: General-purpose AI so far beyond human capabilities that us trying to understand it would be like a lemur trying to comprehend modern human society.",0,2

But breaking it down decade by decade, what do you think will happen for the rest of this century regarding AI? It won't be like AGI just shows up, or superintelligent AGI just shows up. It will be a long, uphill slog with constantly growing new technologies. As we approach AGI or superintelligent AGI, a bunch of machine intelligence tools will show up that we can use even if they aren't AGI. 

For example I'd wager

**2020-2030** - Quantum computing finally arrives, and makes machine intelligence much better. AGI isn't around, but narrow AI that can be trained to do thousands of things (like a form of Watson or Deepmind, but much broader) is around. 

Communicating with a computer will be as effortless as an in person conversation. 

AI will be excellent at predicting your wants and needs and fulfilling them before you are even consciously aware that you have them. 

AI augments our social lives by providing in depth feedback about the mental and emotional states of people around us. It'll be much harder to hide mental illness or trauma. It'll be much easier to date since AI will tell you who likes you and who doesn't (much less guesswork). 

**2030-2040** - AGI finally arrives, but narrow AI that is superintelligent in thousands of tasks is already everpresent. Mass unemployment hits, causing social unrest. The medical field is totally revolutionized as big data combines with AI to offer truly individualized medicine. Robotic doctors who not only diagnose but also create a treatment plan are common. Robotic autonomous surgeons are also in use, although they can't perform every surgery. However they can perform the several dozen surgeries that make up the bulk of surgical interventions. 

I think this is the decade where we have AI where we can basically ask it to read every book and scientific paper ever written, and then it can innovate novel, brand new knowledge and patent ideas based on that skills. Basic science will start to advance much more rapidly in this decade IMO. 

I also think this is the decade when AI becomes better than humans at art. Writing poetry, writing fictional novels, writing screenplays and directing films, writing music, etc. 

**2040-2050** - Superintelligent AGI, but it isn't truly 'superintelligent', just a little smarter than humans

**2050+** - superintelligent AGI that is leaps and bounds beyond what a human being can do. Singularity. ",2,5

* stocking the napkins, condiments, straws...

so and and so on... Tons of little jobs that go into making a well run fast food establishment.

My prediction is all that can be automated by robots within 50 years. I think a loss of a lot of fast food jobs in the next decade will be more because of economic problems and people just wanting to eat healthier. That will cause thousands of locations to simply shut down and lose all those jobs.

Someone prove me wrong and that this 100% automation is happening within 10 years.

I was just getting my head around the idea and beginning to understand it, I mean there is nothing to stop you just chilling out and enjoying the ride, having some lunch, getting some work done or whatnot, but then Volvo announced their Autopilot.

It can steer, accelerate and brake for you, but if you take your eye off the road, lights in the car will begin flashing. If you continue to take your eyes off the road, it will begin beeping and then resort to vibrating.

The car requires your attention and decision making, but it has rendered the user incapable of the actual control. 

Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a driverless car? What is the premise behind the need for this?

As far as preventing accidents goes, the introduction of a driverless vehicle would do nothing unless everybody had one, if someone runs the red light in front of you, you are no less deceased or injured because you are in an autonomous vehicle. I also think that it is poor policy and logic to try and eliminate an issue by default, and render the human race incapable of driving. 

This is probably why alcohol prohibition never worked, the hope is to get people to take drinking seriously, and teaching them to drink responsibly, as opposed to just banning it, which is akin to giving up.

I mean they can help people with disabilities, and, as I said, you can just chill out and let it drive, but I don't know if this is being done for the right reasons, especially since lawmakers will render them compulsory if this technology becomes widespread:

Because it is the future.",9,3

How do I know the body parts I am seeing are my own? The neural network in my brain must have acquired that association at some point in my life, if we assume that no humans are born with such information.

And in contrast to humans, some dogs and cats try to catch their own tails. In such cases, extending the assumption to animals in general, it follows that the tail-chasing behaviors result from the brains of the animals not having learned the association.

From these two observations, I thought about what the difference between the two is. Then I noticed this: humans can easily see their bodies, while it is more difficult for the cats and dogs to see their tails.

Now, if we have a drone with two arms and an eye, so that the drone can actually see its arms, would it learn that its arms are its own? And more directly, if we build an artificial neural network and feed it the video of its abstract layout with all the related information such as the associated weights, would it learn that the circuit images are of its own?

And the currency it was stored in was time$; days$, hours$, minutes$, seconds$, years$ so it would be a universal currency.

In addition animals, plants and all regions of the world would be generate money over time based on their value to the biosphere.

This natural money would then be shared out to people in those regions or if from international land/waters would be shared out around the world.

Could this type of economic model be a good* alternative to our current top down banking model?

* Would providing people and nature with inherent value change the world for the better e.g.

 * Pollution production would devalue the economy.
 * Refugees would have an inherent economic value.
 * Sustaining or boosting nature would boost the economy.
 * Moving to sustainable energy and production would boost the economy.
 * Wildlife and biodiversity would be a big part of the economy.

Or would we just be changing the system without really fixing any problems?

Yes, AI can pose an existential risk, but it's only one of perhaps a dozen. There are existential risks via super volcanoes, meteor strikes, nuclear fallout, superbugs, and more. If we don't figure out AI, then eventually we'll have to deal with one of these other existential risks. 

If we create AI that is hostile to humans, then chances are it would simply be an extinction event that happens sooner than the other possibilities. In other words, the end result of malevolent AI is that same as these other existential risks, just that it'd destroy us earlier than, say, a meteor strike happening in 1000 years.

But what if we manage to create AI that serves us exactly as we hope it does? For one, it means that the existential risk of AI is out of the way, but more so, it would mean we have the ultimate tool for dealing with the various other existential risks that I listed. A benevolent super AI would be significantly more capable than humans in dealing with a super volcano, or a meteor strike, or a superbug. Solving AI, therefore, would be our best bet for ensuring long-term human survival.",63,14

Traffic on big cities like New York or Tokyo ist already very congested which is why I think people will still use the subway at least at first.

Between big cities(100-300km apart) most people in Europe travel with the train but trains are usually very expensive. With self driving cars sharing with 3 or 4 other people would make the trip faster, more comfortable and cheaper. You wouldnt need to go to the station or from the station and you would have to wait or plan for the train. These trips are made daily by tens thousands of people, that would mean there would be cars leaving every 2 minutes in both directions making the trip with self driving cars the better one.

Or the price of the trains would have to decrease a LOT so that people would take the train.

What do you guys think? ",1,0

Off the top of my head, I think AI systems like Google Home are pretty nifty how you can get it to do a whole range of things just by asking; it reminds me of Star Trek.

Another technology, which hasn't penetrated the UK too much just yet is mobile payments. I hear cities in China are cashless now and even homeless people begging for money sit with a QR code in front of them! Aside from mobile payments, there are app-only banks cropping up too, such as Starling bank and Monzo - they're quite radical too.

The last item I've got on the list are Chromebooks. They're now seeping into schools mainly in New Zealand, the United States, Sweden and Canada and I think if kids grow up with these they'll probably catch on. I feel these are quite futuristic because they require minimal setup, no additional security software, and its basically impossible to lose any of your data while using Google's services.

It is quite effective, concentrates resources and denies them to the non-essential part of population.

Without Imperialism, North and South America would still be inhabited by primitives who would not have created anything of value.

Quotes about justifying the removal of Indians from their lands are legion. Was it right to kick them out? maybe not. Did they deserve to be eliminated? maybe not. But, the benefits obtained by removing them and killing some who resisted significantly outweighed the benefits of retaining their homestead, so that was done.

In 1913, as some historically minded people might remember, most of the world was divided by 8 major powers, except for some tiny countries in the fringes of Europe. (China was a 'joint administration' area, much like today's Antarctica.)

The rights of countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, etc to exist, which was upheld by Woodrow Wilson who listened to these people, proved to be less valuable than the harm caused by their very existences. 

it would have been better for Germany, Austria and Russia to exploit their resources at will, since after 100 years of their existences we now know that none of these countries have contributed anything to the advance of science, tech, etc at all. (Tesla never set foot in Serbia and Yugoslavia for all his life so don't cite him.)

If these countries did not exist, Civilization would not have changed for worse at all, and would have advanced much further because the resources of these countries would have been used to develop science, industry and tech, instead of bettering the lives of people living in these regions.

Ditto to the dozens of Third World countries, whose only knack was just increasing their pop and consuming trillions of tons of valuable materials for their people instead of advancing Civilization.

The rights of some people to be free are outweighed by the necessity of an efficient use of resources, to keep it from people unlikely to use them efficiently, in order to advance Civilization further. Look at all the castles and trappings the tinpot dictators built. None of them should have existed to begin with since there would have been no need to build them if they were not given independence.

It is better to keep the majority of world's pop under slavery, virtual slavery and peonage if that facilitates Singularity , Space Conquest, etc.

The Future belongs to those who practice Techno-Imperialism most efficiently. Although china utterly lacks the ability to innovate, its cruelty to its poor and non-elites gives some hope that it will be ruthless enough to meet the future's challenges. After all Mao Tse-Tung was willing to sacrifice 2/3 of China's people during the crisis with USSR in the 1960s.

It is just one of many links about the space weapons which will be online by 2025.

There are rumors that Russia and China are developing space weapons, which I see as little more than a ruse to get more funding for the space weapons program.

USA has a stranglehold over space militarization. 

When nukes were first developed, people like the Rosenbergs, or some misguided idealists (read: commies) who thought another country had to share such dangerous tech in case USA went berserk, gave the tech to USSR which led to untold sufferings and a massive retardation of civilization's growth, not to mention that it raised a necessity (which proved to be false but people didn't know that at that time) to feed the Third World.

However , space tech is hard to mimic, even if there is a spy stealing all the blueprints. it is not built overnight, and Russia and China simply do not have the money to build such systems.

In fact, it is possible that China (Russia's economy is too tiny to match American space military program) could be bankrupted, like USSR, by trying to match US space war programs.

Combined with the 2025 pentagon initiatives, USA will have a military which will not be matched by anyone on earth, and that means USA will be able to get resources from other countries at will, without having to worry about Russia and China making hay.

being able to take the resources of what is now Russia and China at will (plus North Korea, which has a lot of rare earths, already documented by the Japanese during 1930s [at that time they didn't know how to use these stuff]).

is very imperative for continuing the tech civilization and reaching Singularity, etc.

With the completion of these weapon and space systems, the whole world becomes resource pools for the elites of USA, and the world gets closer to Singularity.

1: 

I read something that stated something about a potential issue with society and social progression. It stated that it could be slowed or halted. It uses older people and people's reluctance to change as an example (also uses Einstein and Quantum Physics as an example). It also brings up prejudices as well on top of the previous comment. 

I don't consider this to be a legitimate issue as there are many faults with it and what issues might exist can be easily counteracted. 

The very fact that they argue against something that is different from the current norm says something. 

Examples I came up with to counteract it:


 - Change is something that some fear (again the fact that this person brought this up suggests that some are afraid or reluctant of change, you could easily make an opposing argument in the opposite situation), when these people are young they don't have a fully established reality and believes but once they are set they become close minded and dislike most or certain changes. However there are many who are open liberal minded, and progressive. With the ability to analyze and question properly. With those people with those people they can learn from past failures in order to create something better and not be required to pass on information instead being able to gain it. 
 - Teach people to be open liberal minded and progressive.
 - It is not just older people as it depends on the person not the age. There are plenty of younger people like this and olde people who are open minded. 
 - Close minded people can be helped. 
 - With the right mindset this would not be a problem.
 - Many people are similar to past generations anyway (such as parents)
 - Requiring death should never be a good solution. 
 - Racism calmed down after the civil rights movement in which the racists where either less vocal or changed their ways. 
 - Teach a more progressive mindset to people and society. 
 - Immortality's positives far outweigh any negatives and any negatives themselves can be counteracted. 
 - How will those prejudice people any different than ones that continue to be born?
 - Put them in simulations 
 - New generations could be created if need be.
 - We could have learned how to deal with that by then. 
 - People like Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, and Michio Kaku are examples that not all older people are reluctant to change (which is a stereotype anyway)
 - Life adapts
 - Some people can learn to accept change. 
 - Death shouldn't be a first solution to a problem (if at all).
 - Children aren't needed to solve problems.
 - A new generation isn't required to progress society. 
 - People could continue to learn from mistakes and gain information.
 - Time and Information could help solve the problem 
 - Minds can be altered or erased if need be. 
 - People fought against change before and it turned out fine.
 - No physical or mental aging.
 - Etc. 


Society progresses as normal.
 

Did I miss anything?, also is this a problem at all? and if it is what are ways to counter act it?

2: 
Imagine a microscopic organism that could repair damaged cells. Would this interfere with multi cellular development? If so how might it be counter acted?

Instead of having a human girlfriend or boyfriend, you could just purchase an android that performs outstandingly with regards to sex, your needs, etc. The perfect (mentally and physically) female or male.

What would be the point of a relationship with a human?
You can have sex with your beautiful android everyday, whenever you want. You can talk to them about whatever you want, they will feel like listen and not argue. They will cook for you, clean, do whatever. No need to buy them anything (an engagement ring, gifts, etc). They love you unconditionally.

I think that when this happens to humanity, we probably will not have relationships any longer.

The major obvious problem is how humans will reproduce. We will probably not reproduce through relationships anymore. We will give sperm to labs who will sell them to donors.

What do you think is going to happen and how society will be structured?

***

*I'm not an expert, english is not my primary language and I'm just hoping to learn more about economy...*

***

1 Full Employment but Less Labor Compensation and less hours:

[Employment Ratio has not changed too much.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EMRATIO)

BUT

[Annual Hours Worked by person has fallen.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AVHWPEUSA065NRUG)

AND

[Labor Compensation has dropped considerably](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W270RE1A156NBEA)

WHY? When a company aims to increase their profits they can invest on capital to reduce labor costs, for example buying robots/algorithms and firing people. On the other hand there's not gold linked money supply that allows a lot of new complex activities and investments making posible new companies to rise and disrupt old ones. New companies have a far higher profit/employee thanks to automation but less employees. That's why there's a social polarization and populism rising...

***

2 Productivity, Deflation and Money Velocity:

[The Best way to calculate productivity at a macroeconomic level is GDP per capita, it still increasing, the gap is just the financial ajustment of crisis, too much phantom money I guess: productivity is still rising...](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA)

AND

[It is true that there's not deflation even with stagning wages but there's almost free money (for companies and banks) to keep prices going up, let's see how far this can go...](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)

ALSO

[Money velocity (money transactions like buying stuff etc) is at the lowest level ever. Maybe the real economy still does the normal things with money, but it obvious that money is afraid: what a paradox! You give the world money to finance amazing things since the 80s and now there's so much that it must be protected, funny fact...](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)

I don't actually understand anything xD

***

3 Emotions about Work and Freedom:

I can understand work means employment and employment means security, social interaction, the chance to create a family, new things etc. to a lot of people. But I'm 25 years old and work for me is a bullshit job that a robot/algorithm could do better. There's a gap between generations about what work means and I guess it's the natural and logical way to automate the economy and free Humanity from ""slavery"" by deteriorating working conditions, I mean, each thing feeds the other. It's like:

Parents about work: ""Work gives meaning, a good wage, a good house, a good family, social recognition, stability, products and services etc.""

Young people about work: ""Work is to be a slave doing stupid things a robot/algorithm should/could do, it doesn't provide you enough to live as your parents, each job lasts two days then you'll have to find another one so you can't make plans about the future, and college debt is worse than paying a mortage etc.""

Some day young people will not be able to pay college debt because there are not good paid jobs because automation is better than humans and I'll enjoy that day. It would be like Mr. Robot, you kill debt or debt kills you.

Thanks for reading, my english is getting worse by each second xD

What do you think about this? Is there any mistake?",4,8

That's because it allows you to digitally play around with a an article, (literally) take it for a test drive before you buy it.

I've argued this point before with people in the retail business, and now I find myself in such a situation.

I want to buy an e-reader, and usually I would search the internet for reviews, user video's, and maybe try it out in a shop if they have the right model.

But with VR, I could download a digital model of what I want to buy, and try it out any way I want. This would give me an excellent idea of how fast it is, how the buttons work, what files I can put on it...

Essentially you get to use the item you want to buy extensively before you actually buy it. This helps the customer get the article he or she wants, and it helps the retailer because less items will be returned. You could use this tech for other marketing techniques as well, such as letting people try a new phone design for example, and seeing if they like it.

As such VR could be used to advertise a large number of items, from cars to dish washers to airplane seats. And with AR, you could get an excellent idea of how a new piece of furniture would look in your living room, or fit through your door.",8,8

******

Are you a politician? A leader? The future/current US/EU president?! Here's a guide about the Future!

*******

2010s Redistribution of Work and Wage Subsidies

A good government knows automation is the future. Keynes dreamed about a 15 hours week with a full salary but that's has not been the case (companies prefer one guy, fully paid because of productivity). In the 2010s the solution is to divide jobs into smaller, less paid and more precarious ones (on-demand thanks to an app is their dream). The problem is that this can decrease internal demand then GDP. The solution is to increase public debt by subsidizing jobs, wages and consumption of basic needs. If you keep interest rates near to 0 that should not be a problem. Yes! More jobs, low unemployment and, if less earnings and more bullshit jobs, at least there's no unemployment and you'll be reelected sir (and your friends from Harvard will be happier and richer).

*******

2020s Helicopter Money

Dear Leader, now we have a problem. Technology is exponentially automating the economy and companies are not fools. They know they can replace working hours by machines and algorithms to increase profits. What can we do to save the Free Market? Let's use the Friedman's idea: helicopter money. But, yeah, I know public debt is higher than ever and people is not confident about that fact (even if the dollar can do that ad infinitum). So, tell the FED/ECB (I'm from Europe, Hi from the EU!) to make direct transfers to citizens, like QE but for normal people, to avoid deflation instead of keeping interest rates under -999999999999% (just a joke). Yes! Market fixed! Have you seen those AR glasses increasing human productivity?! What a time to be alive!

*******

2030s A final Step Captain Picard

Neural Links, advanced robotics, specific AI. Wow, people is not needed to create GDP?! Now it's the time to look back and remember a Thomas Paine's idea: Citizen's Dividend. But in a modern way of course. You'll have to fix a % of GDP and directly transfer it to citizens. This way people will keep motivated to generate wealth because, the more the GDP, the more the money they receive. Now we can stabilize once for all the market and technolgical deflation.

********

2040s Not yet. Who's a good boye?!

Now everybody can connect their brains to the cloud, robots and weak AI provide everything at a Near Zero Marginal Cost (Jeremy Rifkin, are you there?) VR is like the place to do stuff. So, from it to bits now the value is in the amazing creations for this worlds not commodities, manufactured goods, services etc. Yes, in Matrix you can eat a golden pizza while surfing a supernova. So, everything is free except human imagination and let's say science theories too. At this point a new market of pure information arises.

*******

Would it be ethical to allow ""colonists"" on Mars to have children and raise those children away from their genetic homeland? The human DNA has evolved for Earth conditions.. what strange effects might be forced on these unwitting children by being conceived, born and raised on another planet? The gravity alone may completely warp their physiology.

Would you force rotations so that individuals weren't exposed to the conditions for too long? ",5,5

Except for the very few people who own stocks on today's major companies which will grow forever, 

All the gains will be enjoyed by those who own  Capital, like land, shares of companies, copyrights, etc. 

The Rentier economy has arrived; those dependent upon fixed incomes, like salary, pensions or welfare benefits, won't be happy. (And ditto to those who might be receiving the Basic Income, which I don't think will happen) 

Someone illustrated the situation like this.

Let say the 1% controls 25, and the rest 75.

In the old days, a gain of 100 meant the 1% is now 25 richer, and the rest 75 richer.

But, now, the situation has reversed - the 1% gets 75, and the  rest gets 25, so the 1% now has 100 and the rest 100.

But, hey, isn't that better than nothing? The rest gained something, just not as much as the 1%.

====

The future belongs to the Capital owners, whose wealth will grow infinitely to cover the entire solar system and beyond as stellar mining becomes commonplace.

With ever more discrepancies of income where the capital owners' share of income grows more and more, they will want to eliminate some eyesores which might depress their property values, and the courts will side them.

So a massive 'population realignment' is inevitable.

As today's 0.1%, or at most their descendants, travel the stars (complete with first class caviar and android sex slaves), the rest, whose numbers will dwindle quite fast, will live like the 19th century tenement dwellers if they are lucky.

That is evolution , and can't be stopped.",17,0

VR would give us the ability to go beyond the boundaries of our bodies. you could walk around the Eiffel Tower in the morning, have lunch in NY, and go bungee jumping in Antarctica in the afternoon. and then go for a stroll on Mars in the evening

this could be virtual or real, through an android. either way everything you sense will be like the real thing and better, as if you were there in person. people could work, play and explore anywhere in the world and beyond, as if they were actually there, or rather their bodies were there",6,6

However, Technofeudalism will end it.

During Feudal Japan, every single Japanese had to be registered at at buddhist temple which kept every person's record. That was to prove that someone was not a Catholic (Japan persecuted Catholics till about 1868, and holding a rosary was a capital crime), but also it really kept social structure well.

So, every single Japanese, from the Shogun to the lowest pariah, was documented and travel was restricted. Usually people were not allowed within 20 miles away from their hometowns; richer people did buy travel permits but had to report to local authorities at every checkpoint. Only government-approved hotels were allowed, and the night curfew was strictly enforced. (Naturally the hotel owners became very, very rich) Sleeping outdoors was a crime punishable by death. (Before WW2, microfilms were made on temple records and kept at safe places to make sure that people's records would be kept even after US bombings.) So, in Japan, it is very hard to fake one's identity and leave a new life.

Japan already perfected such control by 1680. Without computers, punching machines and other artificial intelligence at all. So, it is quite easy to tell who is Japanese and who is a fake one (usually Koreans who use Japanese names). If their ancestors' records can't be found in some temple they are considered to be Koreans and not really accepted by the Japanese society, even now.

Cataloguing everyone and tracking everyone's movement is quite easy by today's tech, but the Xtians are opposing them because whoever wrote the book of Apocalypse could see it coming, 2,000 years ago.

So, they will first be tried in Japan, which already has something like that for 300 years. Every single Japanese (about 120 mil of them) and every single foreigner in that island country is catalogued and their records kept in some database.

The Rentiers do not want to be denied rent, so they will demand those who adopt the nomadic lifestyle to pay the rent at wherever they domicile their vehicle or whatever.

It will be just a matter of time before we can track the moves of everyone on earth - we have computers which are fast enough.

If Japan could do it back in 1680, it is easy to do this around the world in 2030 or so. Heck, it can be done in the Advanced World within 3 years.",0,0
1488,2017-11-16,2017,11,16,6,7d7h6q,What will be left to do - and what is worth learning?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7d7h6q/what_will_be_left_to_do_and_what_is_worth_learning/,ScientiaOmnisEst,1510782127,"Technological unemployment scares the heck out of me; now and them someone can placate me by saying it's a long way off or speculations never pan out, futurists are idiots, etc...but it never sticks and I don't know who to trust. So, might as well ask the people who keep their ears to the tech wall:

1. Seriously, what will a post-human-work future look like? I mean one where even research, programming, medicine, personal service, and all creative endeavors are done by AI. They do it better, do it faster, and there's little room for humans to do anything. There's nothing worth doing. I tried to discuss this in the past and had someone slam me with a lot of nihilistic BS, how my existential anxiety is stupid and delusional, there's no Meaning and AI won't change that - when my whole point is how do you do carve out a worthwhile life when there's *nothing worth doing*? When everything that can be done, has, or is done with no effort or process to enjoy?
One thing I banked on as a ""future endeavor"", something really cool for society to do and that could lead to so much was space travel and colonization. Except now I think we'll probably just have drones do it all and AI manage it, and seriously, what's the point of going to another planet to sit in your apartment consuming media - presumably the only thing left to do. Seriously, what will we do? Where will we redirect our sense of value? Assuming life is okay and we're not struggling to survive, we'll likely do this naturally, but I can't even speculate. And I can say from experience, that gets boring after a while, which leads to my other question. 

2. In a practical sense, what's the most ""future-resistant"" area of study. I know it's STEM, but what areas? I'm already hopelessly stupid, I failed several STEM gen-eds multiple times. But if I could work a miracle and not fail at them again, I kept thinking I wanted to go into engineering. For whatever reason it sounded like that's where the interesting projects are (and that mentality is partly what fuels my whole existential issue. Nothing worth doing, no interesting projects to get involved in, and I'm not smart enough to invent my own). I've never tried programming mostly due to knowing I'll fail, but, like engineering, it seems that's on its way out from automation too. Maybe something in the humanities? Not smart enough to make it to a high level, and will probably be automated. I've toyed with the idea of business, but apparently financial skills are unnecessary with programs now. Plus business is tanking, and I'm unfortunately not an idea person. I'm just getting by on crappy jobs now, but I'm bored, I'm frustrated, and I have no idea where to apply myself. If I'm part of the last working generation, the last generation to do things and be involved in things before it's all ceded to AI, I'd like to not miss too much.

Holy wall of text Batman, I didn't mean for this to be so long. Advice appreciated nonetheless.",18,2

With that much oxygen, plus a bit of cosmic radiation, Mars would gain an ozone layer, which would also help with the radiation problem. 

Now, I know fusion has been 20 years off for 40 years now, but I think it's not crazy to believe that within a few hundred years we will have invented fusion machines that can process the 220 million tonnes of Hydrogen that's required for the terraforming operation. For reference, that's about 1000 big cargo ships filled with Hydrogen. With that said, I've noticed that most terraforming plans rely on greenhouse gases and the sun to heat up Mars, and take on the order of many thousands of years. Do you guys think that using fusion might be able to speed up the terraforming process so that it's complete in just a few hundred years?

If enough people ask I can include a detailed analysis with numbers and all.",8,7

Some people do not want to believe it but it will happen.

The long term goal of the Future is to ditch the earth, and conquer the stars so humanity, or what would come after it, can rule the universe forever.

I discussed that we can probably conquer the local group within 1,000 years, provided if we can find a way to travel much, much faster than life.

A transhuman body, with uploaded brain or whatever, with no organic parts can travel as long as it feels like.

The poor and the less intelligent are probably doomed. Sorry, but that's evolution. There is little resource to be wasted on them, since we need all of our resources and talents to reach the stars.

Space conquest should be Future's chief objective. Since it will significantly increase the resources we can obtain, and broaden civilization's horizons.

Nothing else really matters - everything is just a tool to conquer the stars, overcome and enslave the aliens, and exploit the planets to the fullest.",31,0

but this ignores a far more likely scenario: a huge asteroid turns up and is about to smash into the earth, killing every human and animal on it. shooting missiles at it doesn't work, and we don't have the technology to run away. the end

in the first story AI is the end of humans, but in the second story it would very likely be our salvation, because it is our best chance of coming up with a solution when humans can't find one

our existence is a very fragile one, we live in a world of giant asteroids, black holes, WMDs, mutating cold viruses... any of which could wipe us all out pretty much overnight

any of these could literally happen tomorrow. so every day we delay developing an AI that can help us evolve into a more resilient species, is just as dangerous as hastening it. at least we might have some control over an AI, because you sure as hell can't reason with a sun going supernova",8,2

1790,2017-11-19,2017,11,19,3,7dut64,Is Automation Stealing Jobs From Kids? (An essay) [OC],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7dut64/is_automation_stealing_jobs_from_kids_an_essay_oc/,GershwynnJay,1511030595,"Is automation stealing jobs from kids?

	We like things easy. This is especially easy to say in developed nations, not so much in poorer countries. To achieve the utmost ease, we have made innovations in the home which make our lives way easier and give us the freedom of time. Not to mention the freedom from physical labor, which has lead to fatter and fatter humans, but like I said, I wont mention it.
	There are three appliances in the home which stand out as being mostly automated. Two are ubiquitous: the washer/dryer and the dishwasher. Nearly every home has these things. Its something most people dont even think about. The third is quickly catching up as it sweeps the world with its popularity: the roomba. The automated robotic vaccuum cleaner. Just press a button and let it explore every square centimeter of your floor; plus, itll give your cat or newborn child a free Uber ride to the next room.
	Gone are the days of washing clothes in the backyard with a huge metal tub and a hauling out the old washboard. So what do we do? We take the dirty clothes, shove em into the washer until a sock wont fit. Then we add detergent and start it up, only to be forgotten for three days and the clothes smell sour. (If only the washer would dump the clothes into the dryer) 
	The same goes for dishwashers. Scrub a pot after casserole night with the DnD bros? Eff that. Just run it through the wash, and if there are still bits stuck on, run it again. Whats water, anyway? As a bonus, Ill throw in the lawnmower because I saw one at gerenic giant box store the other day that has all wheel drive. All wheel drive! Your Honda Fit will be useless when the snow comes, but you can strap a chair to the other Honda in your garage and ride it to the corner store for that SubZero Slurpee. And you can earn a few bucks on the way cutting a walk path down the street. If only the trash compactor sprouted wheels and dumped neat cubes of trash at the end of the driveway, amirite?
	The end result here is that these tasks are no longer the incredible hassle of bygone days. So what do kids have left to do? Chores were a big part of growing up, and usually it was the way to earn an allowance. All these tasks have become so easy we are taking jobs away from the children. (Isnt this how the U.S. proletariat feels about jobs and robots?) So what chance do the kids have to earn an honest buck?
	The answer is that the kids still get their allowance. They just dont have to do as much or work as hard for it. They are entitled to it, it would seem. Ugh, nasty word, that. But they are entitled, and they get their allowance, and free time, and all these nice perks which we dont think about because they are kids. All this thanks to innovation and automation.
	Hopefully, from this point, its easy to make the leap to the global landscape. It wont take long to explain. Its the same thing; crappy, arduous, repetitive tasks are automated, and humans benefit. It does feel like the jobs are being taken away, but thats a fallacy which is bred by ignorance. (Yeah, Im calling you ignorant, but its with love.) Its also partly perpetuated by bad people in power so they can keep making money, but thats just classic greed.
	The truth is, most jobs in the future will hardly be jobs. Itll be supervision over machines. And that will become remote supervision. And that task in itself will be spread amongst several people so that time spent will be very low per capita. Super low. Instead of working 40+ hours like we have done forever, even before hours were used as a measure of labor, we will be working maybe ten hours a week for six months out of the year. Thats a hypothetical, but its highly likely. We each do our specialised gig for a bit, and some other dude takes over while we hop on the automated RV and watch Netflix on the way to the Grand Tetons, or Robocon 2035. Doesnt that sound nice?
	What about the money?!? I know youre asking that. What about the allowance, right? Well, we still get that. See, the thing that costs the most is labor. So you work a little bit and do your part for society, and you get rewarded for it, but you also have your UBI. Universal Basic Income. Things wont cost as much, and youll have a nice allowance to get the things you need. Get it? Because well be entitled. I mean, well probably still have to mow the lawn and load the various washing machines, but I hear theyre working on GPS mowers, and who says a washer cant also be a dryer?
	One wonderful side effect of this is those poor countries I mentioned earlier will be able to skip all the mess of industrialization and capitalism, and theyll join the rest of the world in a quasi-utopian equality. 
	What is keeping us from achieving the entitled future? Disconnect and politics. Big money. We are all disconnected in the sense that we have a hard time thinking past our political parties. Beliefs are one thing, but logic and practicality are another. If someone there in front of your face is in danger or needs help right away, youre not going to first ask them who they voted for, youre going to help. And you probably wont miss the cheeseburger you dropped to run to aid. Its because humans are naturally good at the instinctual level. Its preservation of the species. Survival. Its the easy thing to do. The hard thing to do is fight and argue and bicker all the time. Thats hard. That takes effort. Its easy to just be nice to the human next to you. And like I said, we like things easy, so lets be fat together.

I've noticed many Americans are very opposed to UBI schemes as a form of socialism (which it is - not that theres anything wrong with that). There seems to be strong post Cold-war aversion and paranoia. The idea of the American Dream is very ingrained and most people believe the myth of upward social mobility.

So rather than giving everyone some food stamps/'free money', what other solutions could possibly work?

On topic replies preferred. Mostly looking for answers from a political/sociological perspective.

P.S. I realize this is hardly guaranteed, or even probable, since more high tech jobs could come up (similar to how mechanisation of agriculture didn't lead to mass unemployment). But it's a hypothetical situation, so please bear with it :).",113,22

However, that kind of story is not possible in India, where servants live far away, maybe a 3 hr drive, in squalor and are driven to the manor's house where they are watched 24/7 by cameras.

Such will be the life for those not rich enough to have fancy houses in the city.

Gentrification is pricing out poorer people from the city even more rapidly, and I said that sooner or later the richer people will have their policing power, although it is more likely that they will get ex-cops to do the dirty work for them.

Poor people's housings will be razed up even more rapidly, and soon the major cities will have no poor people whatsoever, Shooting up the homeless  will be a favorite pastime of rich kids, who will go and attack nearby poorer towns for fun. And, of course, the courts will not convict them since they are the pillars of Civilization.

A century ago, 5th Avenue in NYC was full of rich people's mansions, with elaborate parties all the time. We are going back to that era. Sorry.

===

Most income, and gains by tech advances, will be monopolozied by the 1%. Nothing for the rest.

With such income, and their gains, they will buy out everyone else who will be driven farther and farther out. 

As technofeudalism takes place, poorer people will be kept in banlieus, like how the French deal with people who are not exactly Gallic, or warehoused like as described in Marshall Brain's books.

Elsewhere I mentioned that Hans Fallada, a very popular German writer during 1930s (he would later be imprisoned by the Nazis in a mental institution), said there was a stop-and-frisk in Berlin for poorer people during the 1920s. The unemployed protagonist in one of his books was forcibly kicked out from the city by the constables, and at the end of the book, early 1932 just before Hitler took power, was living in a shack 20 miles away from the city.

Such fate will wait the masses now, except this time it will be 200 miles away from the city, and all entry and exit watched by drones and processed by parallel computing to make sure subversive people are stopped long before entering the city where worthy people can go around without any danger.",20,0

IBM have made moves trying to produce one but ultimately left it as a PR f-in stunt. 

From the anime Sword Art Online(pls don't quit on hearing anime!)

Appearance:

The NerveGear is a streamlined helmet coated in dark blue. At the back is a long pad with a wire the same color as the NerveGear stretching out of it. It also has a battery and internal memory to store data from the games. 30% of the NerveGear's weight is from its internal battery.

Transceivers:

The NerveGear's high-density microwave transceivers are capable of accessing the user's brain, allowing it to send fake signals to the five senses of the user. The transceivers are not only capable of inducing fake sensory signals but can also block every movement command from the brain to the body, preventing the player from moving their body while in FullDive to avoid injuries. The transceivers are also capable of blocking sensory information from the body to the brain, thus, while using it, the player is completely insensate to the physical world. 

[Story Only, death can easily be avoided, but just adding it for fun] -: The NerveGear is able to destroy a person's brain by emitting high-powered microwaves, shutting down one's vital processes, and Sword Art Online's (SAO) operating system has been programmed to do so if the player's Hit Points are reduced to zero. Despite the exact method that kills a player being disclosed in the story, some of the signs left behind in the brain are cerebral hemorrhaging and arterial occlusion. The NerveGear is equipped with a new generation diamond semiconductor central processor.

And well due to circumstances people died playing SAO in the anime, it could easily be avoided in real life with safety locks that trigger when the player has high mental stress or is physically in pain. And avoidance of a game dev who wants to trap people in an mmo and make them fight to death. 

Oh boy, I wish this is a thing.

The ultimate Full Dive Virtual Reality, where no longer will you need controllers, nor would you need conscious-Ness. An fully immersive VR device where you'll 'Actually' be in the game.

Is this possible? What are your thoughts!

There are countless examples of scientists and thinkers later disavowing their earlier work for a number of reasons. In this case, Blechly's work still stands and he still stand by it. The only real difference is in his rhetoric and I think that we as a society should have a record of the fact that some scientist do not agree with neo-Darwinism

If you dont want to read all my rambling below I'm mostly really curious why the issue of range isn't a bigger deal and why my idea or something similar is not talked about more.

Electric cars are great, i would love one. I know people who have reserved a Tesla Model 3 but the practicality of owning one isn't there yet, in fact they are fairly useless at this point since most people cannot afford 2 cars, one electric for your daily drive and one gas for long trips. That's just not practical, and is why electric will never be a vehicle for everyone. Even a city dweller may want to take a retreat to the wilderness. But too bad, the campground is 150 miles away and you probably wont make it home at least not with the air conditioning turned on.

Well here's my thought, an electric ""gas station"". A place where you can stop along your drive and ""fill up"" in just minutes with a full charge. 

Swap-able batteries would be the answer, you pull in and the attendant opens the hatch just below the trunk lid and pulls out battery cells and replaces with charged ones. 

Every electric manufacturer would need to design vehicles to accept say 1 of 4 standard designs. We would need an electric vehicle consortium to determine specs like an ISO standard.

I just drove 2k miles and while going through North Dakota was thinking about remote electric stations where behind the station was a 1 MW wind turbine that fed power to banks of charging racks full of power cells. An off the grid electric fill up station. 

In fact when they insert your old battery into the rack it measures the remaining power and you get a credit for unused power. So a ""top off"" of your power doesn't cost much. The batteries themselves are about as relevant as a gas tank. They simply become containers that hold power which will translate to miles. 

As the batteries age the charging station will detect this and reject old batteries. These go in another rack and the battery delivery guy will take them for recycling. 

You pay based on kwh received and maybe there is a meter of some sort that detects remaining life of the battery before disposal is needed. So you also pay a small amount for the difference in battery life or get a credit. 

Consumers pay for the initial batteries that come with your car. After that the depreciation of the batteries is covered by the consumer each time they do a swap. It just goes on your account then at the next fill up you get dinged for exchanging old batteries but you have a credit from the last exchange... and the cycle continues. Stations pay for brand new batteries to replace the bad ones they have, but these costs are all covered by the consumer in little bits along the way. ",24,5

Second it wouldn't use us for labor when it would be smart enough to build itself robots that don't tire and have limitation like we do to do what it wants.

I wanted to reply this in another thread that was discussing the future of capitalism, but it wouldn't submit due to length. Maybe it will work as a post. **Edit: yay it worked hooray for things**

TL;DR, Money will become meaningless long before it ultimately disappears, but don't worry because happy days are probably coming within our lifetime.

I foresee the probability that artificial intelligence will ruin the stock market for human capitalist purposes within 10 to 25 years. Certainly, human traders will no longer be able to keep up, and light-speed cut-throat AI trading will manifest a cascade of exploits very quickly, with which regulation will fail to keep up or hope to effectively control.

I expect the inevitable post-Trump progressive rebound, as foreshadowed by the agreeable rise of socialized healthcare and widespread successful efforts to defend it where challenged. Within one generation, the concept of a universal basic income (UBI) will become normalized in the western world (facing automation). Conservative efforts to demonize the phenomenon as a ""sense of entitlement"" born of greed or laziness in the lower class will pale in comparison to an ever-rising tide of growing public sentiment (that would today be regarded as progressive) of the ""fact"" that shelter, food and health are human rights to which all people are or ought to be, indeed, ""entitled.""

Within one generation (should occur no later than 2049 if my political predictions hold true, see below) UBI will stabilize at a point much more generous than current welfare programs, when measured in terms of purchasing power vis-a-vis quality of life by 2017 standards.

There will be impressive minimum wage levels (much better than living-wage) for those who are still able to find and keep jobs, but curiously it may not even be necessary or effective to regulate a minimum wage in a post-UBI world. Presuming wages are paid on top of, *not instead of,* the individual's UBI income.

In an automated future, labour requiring specialized human input will by necessity need to confer a measurable quality-of-life boost in compensation to the specialized human in question in order to attract the human's effort... Although boredom and prestige are also factors in this scenario. Regardless, it may become sufficiently socially responsible to allow actual employment wages and salaries to self-regulate at that stage. You know, because if nobody's starving and everyone's children already have the medicine they need, then it's hardly a social tragedy if given these circumstances whatever remains of the free market shall then determine whether my consensual and voluntary eight hours of effort are worthy of earning a fidget-spinner versus a tropical vacation.

However, in the intervening years between now and UBI, we *will* see better legislated minimum wages and living wage legislation cropping up in patchwork across municipalities and individual States. Domestic migration will be a huge factor, as will corporate lobbying (Walmart &amp; friends are going to continue to be a huge bastard on this and many rural communities will suffer as a result).

In the mean time between now and then, unemployment will have skyrocketed even as cost-of-living plummets, due to automation in production and distribution. The Walmart and Amazon effect. This has already started and you will see most of the major turnover happening within the next 7 to 10 years.

Actual human employment will be regarded as very respectable amongst the lower-middle class and up, and the UBI will be de-stigmatized everywhere but in dwindling hoity-toity circles; An increasingly marginalized perspective that will age out of society in about 2.5 generations.

I actually have a hunch that we never see any profound (e.g. higher than living-wage) minimum wage hike implemented at the federal level. This is because I expect the economic impact of unemployment by automation to happen so incredibly quickly that, coupled with the forces of corporate lobbying, UBI will be pushed to the forefront. Universal income will happen more expeditiously (and more politically palatably for all concerned) than any properly legislated minimum employment wage could be widely implemented.

UBI will also dramatically streamline how social security works via the economics of scale.

This presumes there is no total collapse of large government and rise of free corporatism and megacity enclaves in its place; An eventuality which while theoretically possible, I judge to be unlikely. Secession of individual States appears equally unlikely for both constitutional and economic reasons.

How quickly all of this occurs will greatly depend on how effectively the Republican party rebrands and pivots from their Nazi/Confederate/child-rapist narrative over the next 7 years, and indeed, if the Republican party even continues to exist as a coherent political entity circa 2024. If Dems win re-election in 2024 (fingers crossed) I expect we will see universal income phased in by 2028. My current best guess is that federal UBI happens in President Warren's second term (campaign anchor, election promise fulfilled), but there are too many variables to know for sure.

Capitalism will linger, however, cheap-or-free products of acceptable quality will be ubiquitous. Probably there will come a day where Coke and Pepsi give away their products at no cost, in exchange for nothing but the metrics regarding which is trending higher and telemetry on customers' consumption habits to feed back into their algorithms (and to sell to other entities). All of the remaining economic value in such businesses will transfer to the intangible brands themselves, for their data and message, as the production and distribution costs of the actual physical product approaches negligibility and so does not need to be recovered via a price tag for the end user.

There's a reason Google gives away their services to consumers for free in exchange for nothing but access to our data... Think of Amazon-style widescale production and distribution but run on the philosophy that gave us Gmail. And because of what Google did with gmail, virtually nobody now does, or would, pay for premium consumer email service. This phenomenon will gradually creep across all industries as capitalism fades out. Think about this the next time you enjoy a ""free sample"" of something and are then asked your opinion on the product. Or any time you ""Answer a quick survey to read this article.""

In the next few years, new markets will rise in the fields of content generation (Think YouTube phenomenon but to the power of ten) in the form of extreme exhibitionism as a commodity. Look up *Patreon* if you are not familiar with it, this type of thing will be BIG in the future for extroverted luxury-seekers and the transition is already well underway. This phenomenon is markedly foreshadowed in the present by striking success of many vloggers, ""let's play""-ers, et cetera.

You will be invited to ""Subscribe to Jennifer's Life"" basically, if she's interesting enough that you want to support her pursuit of higher luxury by sending her some of your discretionary entertainment duckets for the privilege of watching her livestream whatever she does as her personal brand. Makeup tutorials. Or playing obscure Nintendo games. Or cooking. Or trying out new sex toys. Or archeological digs. Or deep sea exploration. Or living on a private space station!

We'll see more and more of this type of thing, in ways we today could not even conceive of. (Try to imagine explaining this year's memes to someone from 1999). I virtually guarantee there will be instances of 24hr live streamed ""zero-privacy"" celebrities occurring within 15 to 20 years. Maybe *much* sooner. It will be treated as a ridiculous, frivolous and embarrassing spectacle at first, and very much looked down on-- By a plurality in society conservative on the subject of personal privacy. But, inevitably, it will become mainstream and accepted.

Personal data is already a commodity, it's only logical that streaming content creators will evolve to the point that some of them literally 100% commoditize the entire extent of their private lives. ""Extreamers"" maybe, carrying thousands of diverse Patreon subscribers chipping duckets to watch the edgy cool kid with no fucks to give whether grandma finds out how many dicks they suck on a Friday night, because fuck it, it's 2027 and who gives a shit. Don't be a privacy freak. Look at how great my life is, as promised there will now be 3D drone footage from two separate angles whenever I'm outdoors #Thanks #3MillionSubscribers #BoatSex

Extreamers (or whatever young people decide to call people who do this) are going to be the ""Reality TV"" of the future; Don't forget to like and subscribe, and make sure to click the bell icon so you won't miss when I take a shower or use the toilet. Not all such feeds will be prurient in nature, but of course many will.

There will still be dollars at this point, but everyone will have enough dollars provided to them month-to-month, by the economy thru either the UBI or enthusiastic non-coerced employment income, to cover their needs and desires not just minimally, but to a level of reasonable satisfaction. Everyone will (theoretically) have easy access to decent housing, healthy food, and will be able to access free health care of a high-quality. Non-passion property crime will essentially vanish within one generation of instituting UBI.

With small-scale economically-motivated crime eliminated, most remaining incidents of what we would today classify as ""violent crime"" will be due to mental health issues. And of course there will still be white-collar crime until the dollar ultimately loses tangible value, and interestingly there is probably a transitional gradient of intersectionality with mental health involvement when one considers the hypothetical last remaining capitalists compulsively continuing to cheat and fight each other tooth-and-nail over the final trillions of dollars, rendered essentially worthless but for the experience of the competition, because the rest of humanity has been living for free in harmony served by a system that's partway between Amazon Prime and Star Trek's replicators. Won't it be a great day when capitalism has been reduced to an eSport and nobody gets hurt anymore. *Sigh*

By no later than about 30 to 50 years from now, once *some* of the above has come to pass, there will be an evolved public consciousness regarding mental health. This sense is nascent today, people are already starting to really talk about it but we need to see it go through a critical mass transition like is currently happening with women speaking out about sexual abuse now. More people need to speak out bravely about their (and their loved ones) mental health challenges and not be stigmatized for doing it. Get on that, society.

Anyway, with most everyone able to cover Maslow's needs via UBI, any suffering homeless who are failing to access their basic needs will stick out like a sore thumb. As would anyone habitually exhibiting antisocial or harassing behaviour due to an underlying mental health concern.

Those truly unable to care for themselves will be sympathetically recognised as such, since the easy conservative excuse of indigence due to laziness will have been made obsolete. Mental health will be competently addressed at that time as a system of accessibility accommodations, much of which (keep in mind) can be automated also. Sufferers will be picked up and dealt with by the system as a social disturbance, but not ""the system"" as we currently know it. They will actually be treated and given the help they need rather than processed as criminals.

Those who transgress the rights of others in ways we now deem ""criminal"" will, through the legal justice system, receive appropriate mandated treatment and supervision... Not be sent to punitive prisons as ultimately cruel as they are profitable.

With the corrupting potential of money eventually neutered, even as money itself persists for a time, the industrial prison complex will gradually dissolve. Unfortunately this will happen slowly, not overnight, but it is inevitable; Our economy won't need human slaves in the robot future, and besides, economic allowance for human suffering will be considered extremely unfashionable. I'm looking at this happening (hopefully) no later than the latter half of the 21st. Maybe sooner if the Republican party totally implodes and we get a leg up with some good regulation and prison system reform legislation-- That is, preceding, rather than at pace with, the economic forces involved with criminalization of poverty ballooning due to automation. But a lot of whether this proactive reform can happen in time for the economic upheaval, I think, ties in with race politics which I find difficult to predict at the best of times.

At some point the War on Drugs will end. All drugs that can possibly be used responsibly will be decriminalized and ultimately legalized with regulation. When will this happen? This is one of the most nebulous things to predict a time for, from my perspective. There are a lot of variables intertwined on this point because it all hinges on hypothetical accessibility of effective addiction treatment, which depends on a bunch of previously mentioned factors: Economics of socialized healthcare, adjustments in social taboo stigmatization of recreational drug use and experience of addiction. On the bright side, the pharmatech side is looking very promising already (e.g. Methadone, Suboxone, Naloxone/Narcan) already trending very well toward addressing this form of human suffering, and will definitely solve permanently once self-improving AI hits. But eventually Huey Lewis gets his wish *and* there are no more cartels to boot. Unpredictability aside, I'm thinking 2060s on the outside on this one.

In the nearer term, you will see the problem with bail bonds and the phenomenon of incarceration for failing to pay bills (essentially, jails have become debtors' prisons) getting worse before it gets better, probably coming to a head over the next couple of years, whereupon my expectation is that involvement of large scale organized activism flanked by mainstream support (in the same vein of the BlackLivesMatter movement) will spur the beginning of basic reforms some time around 2021 or 2022. *Hopefully.* But I fear they'll still keep unfairly targeting and throwing poor black men in jail until we make a major advance in either poverty elimination (because poverty disproportionately affects black people due to systemic racism) or private surveillance so that racist cops are exposed and weeded out. The latter phenomenon is already starting to happen and this is why cops hate body cams.

See, on camera, the Good Old Boys just won't be able to get away with their racist fucking bullshit anymore and will hopefully get bored and fuck off to retire and be replaced by less racist young people (and/or robots depending on the timeline).

There will be an enormous rise in private surveillance. Soon. 

The world wasn't ready for Google Glass in 2013, but before too long (mid 2020s likely) many if not most people will habitually wear the equivalent of body cams at all times. And cloud technology, means the cops can't just smash your phone or steal your memory card either. These cameras won't be live streaming your every move and publishing all your comings and goings (unless you want them to, you *Extreamer!)* but it would definitely be recording to memory at all times, to be either kept or discarded (or shared) easily and automatically according to your preferences. 

And just like ""rewinding live TV"" which dates back to TiVo, if something sketchy happens or there's a sudden change in your circumstances, you can flag and refer back to the footage and post your YouTube clip ""Metro PD Officer 1234 Calls me N-Word, Illegally Searches my Bag"" then suddenly Metro PD has social media backlash and Officer 1234 has some explaining to do. And since the cameras are so small and can be hidden in everything these days, gosh darnet, well you know what, Officer 1234 is just going to have to learn how to behave himself properly with everyone he stops. As the tech increasingly mainstreams, the default assumption shifts to public interactions being recorded, rather than assumed not to be.

It's like a dash cam, but for your tits.

You won't know which of the buttons or zippers or earrings or glasses or hair clips or body jewelry or other accessories on (or in) my body happen to contain sensors recording my immediate surroundings and biometric readings... But in the future everyone carries at least some such embedded micro devices. Or enough people do that there's good herd immunity. (2020's many, 2030's most, 2040's very few without)

Bottom line is, if you try to rape me (or drug me, or attack me) the future equivalent of Siri or Google Assistant is going to understand what's going on in real time, and have a police drone show up in moments so that you can get tased or knocked out with a disorienting sonic blast (or whatever) for your troubles.

We're not going to suffer under ""Big Brother,"" we're going to be protected by ""Big Sister.""

And don't worry about being ""spied on"" and having your civil rights eroded. Nobody is going to make your weird porn illegal, or police what you read and whatnot-- Because that would cause social unrest. And nobody in their right mind is going to threaten to doxx you on your weird fetish, because it's the future and nobody cares anymore because it doesn't cause harm and we're all ""over it.""

Anyway, anyone who tries to make a stink ""outing"" or ""doxxing"" other people's private business without their consent will be regarded as the pariah, and people with that mentality usually have more skeletons in their closet anyway. There will be less of this nonsense with ubiquitous responsible mental health treatment available anyway.

If you're not comfortable being recorded, or you're for whatever reason incapable of conducting yourself without violating the boundaries of others, then don't go outside (...and probably, consider checking into some of that free mental health treatment).

But yeah, eventually capitalism will be forgotten and widely regarded as crazy and an evil cause of needless human suffering sort of like how we look back on the Spanish Inquisition now.",7,3

And the resulting complexities are what guarantee malicious elements an inexhaustible supply of exploits - which would be utilized to even more devastating effect by a malicious general AI.

But perhaps the solution to both is the same: A cultural shift in coding toward greater specialization, all the way down to the most basic level.  

Software is an industry that doesn't even have a meaningful unit cost at this point, so there would be no reversal of economics of scale by greater specialization.  The costs that would be imposed would simply be of time - time spent by professionals perfecting a craft, but once they had done so, it would *stay* perfected rather than demanding constant changes like today.

With a sharply-honed product, much like the skills of ancient artisans, the exploits and unintended conflicts would be minimized and have perpetual benefits over time.  So rather than a warren swiss-cheesed by chaotic rat tunnels you are physically incapable of even mapping let alone closing, you get solid pillars upholding a rigorous infrastructure.

Granted, there is a certain aesthetic resistance to this in much of coding culture, with its affinity for dynamism and anarchy.  The idea of turning IT into a baroque science where ""master craftsmen"" practice finely-honed skills with little room for personal innovation is perhaps unappealing on that level.

Nevertheless, it is one possible means of solving both the immediate and annoying problems of modern technology, and the long-term and legitimately terrifying problems that seem to loom on the horizon.",1,3

For whatever reason, a thriving, productive, philosophic civilization - suddenly or gradually -  becomes a chaotic mess of destruction and confusion.  

Where artfully-crafted buildings and cities once stood, you have decaying ruins with smaller populations cowering in fear in high fortresses.  Where art, sculpture, literature, philosophy, and craftsmanship flourished, society becomes radically simplified into peasants, priests, and soldiers, with only a rarefied (and poorly-skilled) crafts culture in between.

Societies seemingly ""forget"" how to do certain things they once understood - workmanship becomes shoddy, artistic depictions become grotesque and childish where they were once almost photorealistic, and infrastructure becomes much smaller-scale and more fragile.  **Or such was the experience before**.

The Romans could build thousands upon thousands of miles of roads, many of which are still used.  Vast aqueducts, fragments of which still stand.  Structures both beautiful, functional, and robust, which survive today.  But their medieval successors could only handle building a grand cathedral here or there, and even then would often botch the details - some of the most beautiful Gothic churches are full of uneven edges where structural elements failed to properly meet, for instance.

Why?  And how is this relevant to the point?  Simply put, technology wasn't technology before modern science - it was **craftsmanship**; a form of art driven by a carefully-honed aesthetic sensibility rather than knowledge of mechanical function.  You *had* to study under a master for half your life to know how to do anything properly, because they themselves didn't know how - they just had developed an intuition for it through practice, and the quantitative aspects were a smaller part of the job.

In a huge, rich, and stable civilization, there was enough work to pay enough people to do this over time that the best talents would rise in their craft and be in demand.  They would then take on pupils who they deemed worthy or whose parents were very generous patrons (history rhymes, doesn't it?), and slowly  what we today erroneously consider that society's ""technology"" would develop when in actuality it was art.

So when societies were devastated by war, famine, and plague, and their best talents died or were too preoccupied with mere survival to adequately pass on their craft, the craft simply evaporated.  Just staring at their surviving work wasn't enough to know how to replicate it, and (as mentioned) what writings they left behind were woefully inadequate to transmit an artistic sensibility. 

As a result, things could fall *completely* apart.  They ""forgot"" how to do things *because they never knew in the first place* - it was **culture** rather than technology, sensibility rather than knowledge.  But what did remain of actual knowledge, survived: The Roman arch, firmly articulated in their understanding of basic mechanical forces, survived into the Middle Ages and was included and even evolved in medieval architecture.

The point of this history lesson is that the reverse is true today: Most of what we do is technology rather than craft.  In fact, our craft is terrible - ancient architects would be horrified at most of what we build, not because it's different, but because it's legitimately crap from an aesthetic perspective.  But nobody cares because *it works*.

So what happens if there is another apocalypse - if the line of higher education is completely interrupted, all the professional scientists and engineers are dead, and mere survival becomes the order of the day for most?  Well, you've still got people who survived who were electricians, electronics techs, plumbers, math teachers, nurses, people with outdoor experience, etc., and their knowledge would provide an *immediate* survival advantage for them and those around them - far more than the artistry of ancient masters.

Moreover, provided that books are still printed at the time of the catastrophe, you've still got libraries and school storerooms full of additional information they might need, because *technology* (unlike craftsmanship) can be taught in a textbook or DIY manual.  

What this means is that a ""modern"" Dark Age settlement would not much resemble the movie trope of one: It would absolutely have electricity, running water, basic hygiene, and nursing-level medical competence.  It would teach its kids how to read, write, and do arithmetic.  It would have radio.  People would be just fine in the cold winter and the hot Summer, and they would have the basic skills to cope better with epidemics than the ancients, though they would still be devastating.

But yes, it would *look* bad because the craft level would be terrible.  As functional as the technology is, the lack of craft would indeed make it look third-world and messy; the electronics and mechanical systems would look steampunk because of the lack of time or resource margin to care about aesthetics.

Societies would not fall into simple Mad Max categories of the hippie commune or the spiked-shoulder-pad Road Warrior empire either - they would be diverse, depending on the exact cultural makeup of their populations, and they would be absolutely be in communication with each other because of radio and maybe simple TV.  

Some would be monstrous dictatorships, but as per political history, most would fall somewhere in between - some oligarchies, some tolerant republics, a few diabolical tyrannies, a few bright, shining democracies.  And yes, it's true, they would go to war with each other; form alliances and power blocs to deal with security.  

And that brings up the other bit of scientific knowledge that wouldn't go away: **Aerodynamics**.  Yes, sooner or later, the Modern Dark Age city or alliance of cities would build functional aircraft, however basic.  Which means they could attack each other from the air, but also conduct safe travel within the territories of cities that were allied together.

Since offense breeds defense, the simple forms of aerial attack that could occur in this scenario would mean that our Relative Apocalypse could involve towns with ballistically-armored buildings - perhaps covered in some poorly-made substitute for kevlar.  Or possibly, for richer and more organized cities, large domes of it.

To summarize the conclusions of this thought process:

* Dark Ages have little to do with technology, and are mostly a decline in *economic scale* and *artistic craftsmanship*.

* Since pre-scientific civilizations relied entirely upon economic scale and artistic craftsmanship for their infrastructure and lifestyles, the failure of these factors made Dark Ages much more extreme for them.

* Since modern civilization is thoroughly scientific, with basic physical equations and engineering principles ubiquitously recorded and distributed around the world, modernity would be much more resilient against a less-than-thorough apocalypse.

* A post-apocalyptic civilization today would most likely have (unreliable, short-range) electricity and radio/TV communications, (basic, and shitty-looking) electronics, basic medical and hygiene skills, and probably simple air travel.

* As such, its restoration to prior levels of capability would be much quicker, possibly within a century or two, if not even less.

This can be done either through modifying our genes so that the next generation(s) all have this diet, the genes of present living people or just the diet systems of ourselves somehow. The solution and goal is to switch humans into expanding our diet in order to rely on more sustainable food sources that consume the least amount of Earth's resources, and try to go for something as unlimited as possible. By doing so we can avoid catastrophe.

There are two possibilities:

1. Human photosynthesis, as in we take sunlight/UV rays and make it into food for our bodies independent of meat or vegetables. How this will be done we don't know yet.

2. A switch to Hematophagy(We live off blood), can be achieved by either altering our immediate diet's digestive bacteria to cope with it, or our genes somehow by perhaps inserting traits from species of animals like vampire bats which have this dietary trait. Leeches, Mosquitoes, Fleas, Ticks and Vampire Bats all have this diet and despite high numbers they have not suffered alot of scarcity at all. Blood is easier to acquire and less scarce than meat, species of animals that have a diet based on  hematophagy also do not have hoarding behavior. We are already able to create artificial blood and the technology is getting better. Living on blood you can harvest your food source multiple times from a single animal without killing it compared to meat, then repeat when they regenerate. There is always a higher abundance of blood compared to plants/meat.",4,0

What made me think is that I grew up on Terminator 1 and 2 and have the image of terrifying killer skeleton-robots as my frame of reference - very deadly (and cool) but ultimately shaped within human constraints which means they walk at our pace and they take time to point and then shoot like we do etc. The human condition applies to them too.

But Elons tweet made me realize that won't be the case. Now I know that we for one need *vastly* better battery technology before robots can work independently within any significant timeframe, but the idea entertained - how will faster-than-human-vision robots impact society and war? I'm having difficulties speculating on this, any thoughts on impact and uses?",8,3

That got me wondering if he started The Boring Company as a sort of last resort for humanity, just in case shit hit the fan. Seeking out cheaper and more efficient ways to dig underground struck me as an odd route to go for alleviating traffic congestion. I mean, in lieu of automated flying cars or building layers of bridges, which I would assume to be easier and more cost effective in  the long run. 

Perhaps Im just reading too much into it, but it got me thinking, what if all the scaremongers end up being right, and a Skynet sort of scenario did happen? Would fleeing deep underground be humanitys only prayer for sanctuary? It would certainly put us out of reach of satellite detection, at least.

What do you think the future of privacy issues will be in the 2017-2030s time frame [2017-2039]?

Will owning a manual-driven car over a shared self-driving car [SDC] be seen as a privacy-conscious or off-the-grid manouevre, and not being on social media being seen as *good*? [I believe South Korea forces citizens to get ID via social media].

I would be interested to know [and if you're good at writing timelines, then feel free to] the major privacy issues that could come up in this timespan.

I devoured the WaitButWhy article on it, and I'm brimming with hope at the possibilities. It's very clearly in the earliest stages of development, and there are all kinds of medical risks that need to be addressed. But damned if it doesn't give me hope.

Does anyone know if this sort of technology, assuming it works, could let you change your personality on command? What you're attracted to, what makes you laugh, what hobbies you enjoy, what you're passionate about? 

There's a bit of self interest here: I have a very narrow range of 'things' I'm passion. I don't know why that is (perhaps I'm on the autism spectrum, who knows)? I envy those passionate about so many different hobbies, events, topics, etc. 

So, say it's Neuralink arrives by 2050, and....well, will I be passionate about all kinds of things in that year thanks to this tech? Seems too good to be true...

Bonus Question: Is 2050 even remotely likely for Neural Lace-like technology?

Until then, most drivers drove uninsured, and victims of auto accidents had no way to get compensation. In other words, if you couldn't afford a car, get the hell out of the road.

So, it was kind of OK for a rich person to run over a poorer person, as Daisy ran over the mistress of her husband in the Great  Gatsby. 

 Nobody has kept a track of it, but In many countries of Asia, the compensation for killing someone who died in a traffic accident is maybe $30,000 - 40,000. And usually the driver, if he/she can use a good lawyer, does not stay a day in jail. 

Such attitude is good for Civilization since it keeps the richer people out of jail and continue to generate economic activity, while culling the poorer people who can't drive better cars.

That kind of attitude is why some people might think that the tech developments will occur from Asia (not necessarily by Asians, though - some people who are sick of regulations could move there) since there are less risk for failure and less compensation too.

I think that in order to drive Civilization, we should cap the compensation for activities related to the Future at , say, $25,000. Those who get killed by self-driving vehicles, for example. They could still be compensated by their own insurance, and if they couldn't afford that, too bad.

The victims of the Tuskegee study received

&gt;. Living participants who had syphilis got $37,500; heirs of deceased members of the control group received $5,000.

back in the 1970s, although the settlement money is still being sued by the descendants of the victims, all of them blacks. 

And of course Japan will never pay a yen to the victims of Unit 731, which significantly advanced Civilization.

So, to facilitate civilization and advance tech, we should limit compensation for any mishaps Future techs will incur at $25,000. Human costs are going to be trivial in face of the bigger picture, since humans will not be too valuable in the future when labor disappears.

Removing the compensation factor from development significantly reduces the cost, burden and restriction from developing future techs, and will bring Singularity faster. Richer people will be able to find stuff to protect themselves. Poorer people won't, but that's evolution.",2,0

I'll just spew my questions out below, if you have any insight on any of them, please let me know.

* Solar panels Can either be fixed, or have tracking ability.  Tracking worth paying for? I know it depends on season, so I suppose tracking would make the solar output more normalized throughout the year.

* Other than the panels, what other devices are required? I've read about systems which require voltage regulators for instance.

* Preferred storage method?  Tesla power wall, Goal Zero Yeti 3000, Chain of car batteries?   Are there other options?  

* I'm approaching this mostly with a survivalist approach. ICE\SHTF I want a reliable way to produce and store energy in a low maintenance way. Am I missing anything major with this being the end goal?

* Some fuel powered generators have the ability to connect to a wall outlet to make the outlets in your house live.  Is this inherit with how the wiring works, or is there some sort of breaker bypass that would need to be installed?

* While in a non-emergency, how easy is it to have the Solar power supplement my connection to the grid? How does sellback-to-provider work?

* Are there any grant\incentive programs I can look into to get a boost in funds to do this?  Perhaps if sellback is profitable enough, worth pitching the idea to a bank for a loan?",8,22

But what if a collapse of the modern world was only temporary?

Let's say that life goes on up to the 2030s. We have plenty of new technology (though not to the level of some AI-evangelists on this subreddit). Many economies focus on renewable energy, but many rely on oil as well.

Then suddenly, global collapse happens. Ecosystems collapse and countries are faced with myriad effects of climate change, such as floods, droughts, hurricanes and crop failures. The world oil supply sputters and stops. Climate-caused conflicts arise across the tropics, while Europe, Asia and North America are flooded with refugees, yet have their own food shortages as well. Governments are unable to cope in the fallout. 

The next fifty years are a relative dark ages for the world. (I won't say what societies have and don't have- use your imagination). But then, modern society, somehow, starts to grow again.
