Life will stink for more and more people as transient, 'gig' economy will be the norm for most who are not smart . That will prevent family creation as stability is gone, and many people will die without reproducing with no permanent jobs or places to stay.

That is evolution, indirectly letting only the most intelligent and economically productive people to reproduce.

&gt;gig jobs create a lot of economic valuethere is no waste, because workers, who are dependent on feedback and referrals, are fully accountable for their success or failure, whereas in corporate america, the cost of individual incompetence and sloth is shared by the entire firm (its like those group projects in school, where the smart kids do all the work but everyone gets equal credit)

They are good for economy, because companies are no longer responsible for bad employees, and do not have to care about employee benefits anymore.

That leaves more money to be invested, and increases economic value.

Also, small businesses will die in the future. The cost of rent, interest, insurance and other overheads increase faster than inflation. And while large businesses will enjoy almost zero percent rate of interest so gobbling up smaller fishes will be very easy, smaller businesses will not be able to get credit and be destroyed.

The whole world economy will be dominated by a few huge companies, with noting in between, and those not smart enough to work for these tech giants or own lots of real estate will be reduced to the level of medieval peasants, or the late Roman serfs who sold themselves to huge plantations called the latifundium where the owners could do whatever they felt like to the serfs.

As we reach space, the benefits of space exploration will be monopolized by the big companies like Google and Amazon. Whether Elon Musk might be able to benefit from this depends upon whether he actually has the 'meat', since he tends to be more sizzle than fat.

with billions reduced to the level of the denizens of Kinshasha in Congo, the new level of civilization will be dominated, funded by the big companies who want to be gods.",2,10,False,self,,,,,

Unfortunately, this sub (like every sub) is basically an echo chamber.  I got brought back to reality a little bit today.


My company's president/CEO does an annual ""state of &lt;Company&gt;"" address; the first couple of sessions for this year's address were today.  He always does a Q&amp;A session after he's done talking.  I raised my hand, and mentioned that Tesla, Uber, and other companies are rapidly testing and deploying self-driving cars.  I asked him how he thought that self-driving cars would affect our industry.  


His initial look was a mix between deer-in-headlights and disbelief.  He said that it was a huge topic to discuss.  Then he proceeded to express doubt that self-driving cars would ever catch on with most people.  He said that if self-driving cars were indeed the future, why not just ""fly around like the Jetsons?""  The crowd all laughed in agreement.  He continued by mentioning that he's ridden in a lot of cabs, and that he wouldn't trust a car that drives itself up to the curb to pick him up.  Again, the crowd laughed along with him.


He did bring up a semi-valid point: before self-driving cars can travel along **every** road, many roads will need to be drastically improved.  Especially in rural areas, where dirt and gravel roads are still common.  ",13,15,False,self,,,,,

Imagine a perfectly straight road.  *Perfectly* straight, to the utmost limit of technology.  And it is not just straight in a two-dimensional sense, but in three dimensions as well, so that as you continue building it, the curvature of the Earth makes it necessary for the road to become increasingly elevated.

You build this ""Tangent Road"" (as in, a straight line tangent to the Earth's surface) as far as you can technologically manage, which would be limited by the height of the structures needed to support it as it became higher and higher relative to the surface.  

You can cheat a little by starting it in a lowland plains such that you can use hills and mountain tunnels at certain points as natural supports, letting you extend the Tangent Road quite far.  But at a certain point you reach the limit of current structural technology and must stop...until technology leaps forward, and you or future generations can once again extend it.

Imagine driving such a road, emerging from a tunnel in some high mountain with your path just disappearing into the apparently infinite blue sky, the clouds scudding by below.  

There are some inherent limits to the concept, of course.  The further you extend the Tangent Road, the steeper it is relative to the force of gravity, so it would very gradually approach near-vertical angles once it was built into space.  And if you could build supports strong enough for it to be in space, you might as well just build a skyscraper rather than some mathematical absurdity of a perfectly straight road.

But just think how beautiful such a thing would be, and how incredible the experience of traveling it would be.  A ""road into the sky.""

In practical terms, of course, there is no justification, so it will not happen simply because the technology for it becomes available.  But perhaps in the far future, when that technology is trivial, such wonders may exist for the sake of their beauty alone.",5,10,False,self,,,,,

It should not be allowed to be taken over by a technological singularity.

As our technological advancement and it's waste products pollute and destroy Earths biobubble should we push for advanced technology to be space based to save Earth from being consumed by the Singularity?

A Silicon based Technology / Singularity does not need the Earth and it's biobubble therefore it will just destroy it, directly or indirectly.

Just as our technological civilisation is polluting and destroying the Earth's fauna, flora and biosphere.

So what if we ban supercomputers over a certain size performance threshold from the Earth, where the nearest place they can be setup is the Moon.

This should limit apocalyptic graygoo scenarios and massively push our space based technology drive.

We are already moving into a future with a massively growing  wealth / tech / AI gap.   And our technology/civilisation and economy is devastating our planets biosphere and ecology.

Should we be migrating our technology and industry into space and away from the overstretched ecosystem of our fragile blue biobubble?

These applications are much further down the line than we are now. The current applicability is its eventual cost effective storage. However, my idea doesn't apply to the storage, but to its potential ability to create NEW information. 

Put all information we currently have into DNA strands. Have strand 1 be able to attempt to replicate itself with strand 2 ( both strands are identical). Allow this replication to occur indefinitely. The DNA and its information would mutate (or do not prevent mutation in the DNA) as is the result of organic DNA replication. 

Then, have a hyper advanced machine (compared to our current technology) decode all the mutations in all the replicated strands. The decoder would then be able to filter and detect certain mutations of the information on the DNA which are logical and functional. 

Doing so would allow for rapid creation of new information from what is already known. Instead of waiting for individuals or slow machines to deduce and induce truths from our knowledge, the DNA could create an infinite amount of combinations of information in a short amount of time, and also with out the biases and limitations of the human mind and man made machines. 

TL;DR - information encoded into DNA if allowed to replicate would mutate the information into infinite combinations which could lead to advancements and insights based off our current knowledge. Doing so would rapidly increase information regarding everything we know. 

This is all contingent on a machine being able to 1) rapidly decode the vast amount of mutated information 2) determine which information bears sense and use. 

Kurzweil talks about the exponential growth of technology. This type of tech would push the line verticle in regards to capacity/processing vs time 

The best inventions reflect nature. As DNA is an excellent storage device, it will serve as the best storage device we can conceive of building. But we can use our slowly developed understanding and implant it into an independent source of generating new ideas. It is a part of nature, and is not a machine created by man which is limited by what we program it to do. ",1,1,False,self,,,,,

However, on the other side of the coin, as well as offering autonomous vehicles and mobility as a service, should the automobile industry try and align itself towards being part of the entertainment and tourist industry?

Marvel and DC Comics are this in the comic book and film world, and the amount of Comic-Cons every year prove this, as do film exhibitions, premieres etc.

Although there are webcomics, the art of the printed page and comic books hasn't become obsolete - both happily co-exist.

What I am suggesting is that, since automobile marques are brand names anyway, automobile manufacturers could try and make automobiles geared towards enthusiasts [the theory being if you need to get from A to B, you'll choose the self-driving car / mobility as a service option, but if you're an enthusiast, you'll either buy or lease a car from them].

Automobile ownership is both practical and emotive - it depends on where you live and when.

For example, in 2035, Future!Peugeot would offer you the 4009 crossover, a stationwagon/crossover powered by a newer, cleaner version of gas, with a 2.0-liter/240hp 4-cylinder turbo or in EV form as the e4009, it has semi-autonomous driving capabilities, and is able to go off-road, and this vehicle would be on sale for $30,000 or leased at $x/per month. Joining Peugeot with a membership could give you the chance to visit events run by them, and lease different cars - but here the emphasis is on enjoying the cars, rather than marketing it as mobility-as-a-service like Lyft. I'm talking long-term leases.

In theory - the brand could become like a club people pay a sort of membership to join with people getting smartphone updates on events the brand are running, consumer feedback clinics etc.

I wouldn't want human-driven cars prohibited from public roads - it would be like banning alcohol just because some people cause fights or death due to alcohol [some Arab countries do ban alcohol but this is due to cultural, rather than legal, reasons]. Doing so would probably not be a political vote-winner and people would feel it was taking away their freedom of choice.

There is room for both human-driven and autonomous cars in this world - same as haute cuisine and homecooked food alongside fast food and street food.

Would this be fair - human-driven vehicles [privately owned] that are safe and won't crash [if Volvo's plan to have an uncrashable vehicle works] alongside autonomous vehicles [a *de facto* public transport]?

Also, there are plenty of scenic views - rural Lincolnshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, North Wales, Scottish Lowlands and Highlands, the Midwest of the United States - as examples, and the tourism industry is often very dependent on automobiles too.

Singularity, transhumanism, etc are good but without more energy and resources they will be limited by the earth's available resources.

Elon Musk's peacemeal approach will be too slow. A major, global effort to capture the space resources is needed to ensure human civilization's survival for a long time, before real resource shortages hit us around the years of 2030-40.

Elsewhere I suggested drastically reducing living standards of the non-elites in the advanced world, and everyone in the non-advanced world, so resources could be preserved for the advance of civilization. I.e. no more internet games at jakarta and no more cellular phones in the shantytowns of Jo'burg.

A lot of techs were tried and shelved, because the money was spent to finance Vietnam and support social programs, in addition to making some middle eastern sheiks extremely rich.

Now that has to end - I think that if we drastically reduce all social programs, and pull all of our efforts, we will become a spacefaring species around 2030 , just before the collapse arrives. If we do not do anything we might be just a bit late for the unravelling to take place, and will have to do an unlikely stunt like the ""interstellar"", which was too unbelievable for me since Cooper's body would have been hit by some asteroid before he ever got to his room.",53,0,False,self,,,,,

But an answer I keep seeing is ""in 20/30/50 years..."".

This is a problem because with technology evolving at an exponential rate, the future is going to get here much faster than anyone can imagine.

Essentially technology will evolve and impact our lives twice as fast as people would expect short term, and even faster long term.

Meaning that what people expect to happen in 5 years (for example self driving cars becoming mainstream) will happen in just 2.5 years.

What you'd expect 10 years from now (brain-computer interface used by the public) will be here in just 5 years.

And what you'd expect to be here in 20 years (superintelligent AI for example) will get here in just 10 years.

And any estimates of what 2067 might look like would be better aimed at 2167, they'll be more accurate

People assume the world will evolve at the same rate it did in the last century, that we'll get some cars, some computers, and that'll be it.

This is where the government simply writes every citizen a check each month to make up for the fact that robots have conquered the workforce and rendered mere humans nearly unemployable.

This idea is concerning to many of us who have a ready seen the devastating effects of government welfare on inner cites.  Broken families, drug and alcohol addiction, rampant crime and general hopelessness.  Repeating this failed experiment on a population wide scale seems ill advised.

I have a interesting proposal that mitigates a lot of the issues that could be caused by mincome.  It will cause some screaming and ranting among the more liberal readers here, but to be fair, my second paragraph probably already did that.

1. It is estimated that in the next decade or two that there will be 45% unemployment due to automation.
2. Women currently make up about 45% of the workforce.
3. It has been scientifically proven that a child is better off with a stay-at-home mother versus without one.
4. Better children make better adults.
5. Better adults compete better against robots in the workforce.
6. Better adults lower the cost on everyone by lowering crime and disease. 
7. The second income in any household has hidden costs that steal roughly 40% or more of the second income earner's check.  These include child care, tax benefits, and transportation and meal costs.
8. If you pay someone to do a task, they feel validated and do it better.

The obvious conclusion from these points is that rather than pass the mincome out to everyone  pay stay-at-home mothers so that women will be encouraged to leave the workforce, (leaving more jobs available and raising demand and thus wages) and raise healthier, better adjusted children.

Leave your screaming rants below.",21,0,False,self,,,,,

**From: D____ B_______**

**Subject: Re: The AI Threat Isn't Skynet ([RISKS-30.16](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/30.17#subj26))**

In RISKS 30.16, Chris Drewe asked, ""so what did happen to the leisure
boom?""  Which is a question I've thought about quite a bit, because I
remember being promised the same thing by futurists when I was young.

I think it pretty clearly ran into the fact that it's generally preferable
for a business to employ a small number of full-time workers, or better yet
non-employee contractors, instead of a large number of part-time staff.
This is both for microeconomic reasons (administrative costs, etc.) and
macroeconomic ones (keeping the supply/demand ratio for labor high,
ensuring low wages.)

Futurists simply didn't see the perverse incentives involved in the labor
market.

The result of higher worker productivity, then, is the same work is being
accomplished while employing fewer people.  In an efficient free market
wages would drop, the supply of labor would decrease in response, and the
market would re-balance.  But people can't just leave the labor force,
because they need money to buy food and shelter.

The result is a win/win for employers.  Not only do they employ fewer
people, they can drive wages down!  The money saved, of course, goes to the
business owners and shareholders, concentrating money at the top.

So in the end, instead of a leisure boom, automation led to a whole segment
of society either living precariously from contract job to contract job, or
living with relatives because they can't make enough money to live on their
own. It's led to wealth concentration.  Circumstantial evidence suggests
it's even led to shorter lifespans, at least in certain areas of the US.

AI can only make this worse. If AI researchers are over-optimistic, then it
will be slightly less worse than is currently projected, but that's about
the best we can hope for.

I'm not sure what the end game is, or how to make it better.  Basic income
has a certain logic to it, but runs smack into powerful cultural ideas
about work and morality.  As politicians in the US often remind us, the
Bible says, ""he who will not work, neither shall he eat.""  I'm genuinely
worried it will end with a lot of people starving.

In every one of them someone says something along the lines of 'Noone will hire a robot for that' or 'It'll take 10 years to build a machine for this.' 

Automation does not require a complete human replacement. If I automate 5% of my daily workload, sweet I just picked up some of my day back. If I release that to 100 people, those people now have enough spare time to pick up an extra 5 people's worth of work. 

Automation has been happening to everyone for a long time. It doesn't replace industries all at once anymore. It nips at the edges a little bit at a time, making your job easier or more efficient day after day until you can do the work of what was once a 10 person job. 

Stop assuming it's a robot that will take your job. It's more likely just gonna be a combination of 20 pieces of software and the removal of a bunch of red tape that was slowing down a process. The 'robot' doesn't need to think, it can just help a person think faster.",19,6,False,self,,,,,

I'll drop my 2 cents in and I'd love to hear from others what their thoughts and ideas are.
First off I'd like to say I don't think AI or more accurately ASI, would be malicious towards humans just that it may see removing humans from the equation of its given task to be the most efficient means to achieving its goal. Elon Musk gave a good example : ""If an AI is created to reduce spam then the most efficient way of reducing spam is getting rid of people"" it isn't malicious simply a means to an end.

My thoughts are programming in not only Asimov's three laws with the definition of harm being ""A diminished state of physical, psychological or emotion well being"" but to also program in a ""Punishment-reward"" Algorithm something along the lines of (DISCLAIMER: I am not a software engineer so this will likely be nonsense and I apologise for my ineptitude) :
If {Human harmed} 

Then {Sad}

If {sad}

Then {lower functionality}


If {Human Obeyed}

Then {Happy}

If {Happy}

Then {Increase functionality}

Basically the idea is so that if they harm or disobey humans then the completion of their assigned task becomes more difficult,much like when a human becomes depressed, if they do work with humanities best interest in mind they have access to more of their computation power and thus can complete their task faster.

Those are just my idea's but I am not an engineer or computer scientist so I may very well be way off the ball here. I was wondering what the idea's of others may be ?

*  Electric vehicles are currently 50%+ cheaper to drive than their equivalent gasoline guzzling counterparts (after the car is driven off the lot):

http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/01/f28/eGallon%20methodology%20%28Updated%20January%202016%29.pdf

*  The formula for the cost (in dollars) to drive an internal combustion vehicle vs. the cost to drive an electric vehicle is as follows (where^ -1 means the reciprocal, or 1 divided by the variable):

Internal combustion engine-- [(x miles per gallon) * (y dollars per gallon)^-1]^-1 = z dollars per mile.  Plug in electric vehicle-- [(a miles per kWh)^-1 * (b dollars per kWh)] = c dollars per mile.  If z &lt; c, then the internal combustion engine is cheaper to drive, if z &gt; c then the electric is cheaper to drive.

Likewise, [(d miles per gallon) * (e miles per kWh)^-1 * (f dollars per kWh)] = g dollars per gallon gasoline equivalent for driving an electric vehicle. If g &lt; the current price of a gallon of gasoline, then the electric vehicle is cheaper to drive.  

*  An idling internal combustion engine vehicle consumes between .16  to 1 gallons of gasoline per hour of driving: https://energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-861-february-23-2015-idle-fuel-consumption-selected-gasoline-and-diesel-vehicles

* Electric vehicles don't ""idle"" in the same way as internal combustion engine vehicles do; and thereby won't waste the estimated 6 billion gallons of gallon of gasoline per year people in the US consume going nowhere:
http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/08/fuel-efficiency-new-rules-idling

*  It seems impossible that a gallon of gasoline, which weighs about 6.3 pounds, could produce 20 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) when burned.  However, most of the weight of the CO2 doesn't come from the gasoline itself, but the oxygen in the air.

* When gasoline burns, the carbon and hydrogen separate. The hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O), and carbon consumes the free oxygen present in the surrounding air to form carbon dioxide (CO2).  Therefore, to calculate the amount of CO2 produced from a gallon of gasoline, the weight of the carbon in the gasoline is multiplied by 44/12 or 3.7.

* Since gasoline is about 87% carbon and 13% hydrogen by weight, the carbon in a gallon of gasoline weighs 5.5 pounds (6.3 lbs. x .87).  We can then multiply the weight of the carbon (5.5 pounds) by 3.7, which equals 20 pounds of CO2!

I've come up with two:

- AI trainer. As AI becomes more sophisticated, the art of programming will likely become a more interactive, guidance-based process. This will require some skill and understanding of the various underlying algorithms or processing methods, and the specific characteristics. It will also require ability to sense that an AI is going off on the wrong cognitive path and redirect. Deep understanding of the multidimensional ""hill climbing"" logical optimizing processes that are inherent to neural networks and related systems will be essential. This is presently a PhD-level task but will have to be developed into a non-academic industrial discipline, with specialties for different application areas.

- AI concierge / ombudsman. Like the infamous DMV, AI decisions may often seem nonsensical but very difficult to reverse. A cadre of people who can work with / within the system to work out a better solution will become important. This might be considered related to attorneys, conflict managers, but with at least some understanding of the operations of the AI that operates in a specific application. This is analogous to people today who deal with customers who receive a telephone bill for $1,000,000.

So those are my two suggestions. Let's see how many others we can think of.",16,7,False,self,,,,,

We can spend millions on state of the art encryption and security systems.. and just one talented 25yo who can hack a remote controlled kettle or an 'intelligent' fridge will render that effort moot.

There is no privacy any more, there is just an uneven access to information. Privacy increasingly means becoming a 100% disconnected social outcast.

So how to make the world a better place? Can we imagine constantly having on-demand access to all data about everyone? How would the society change then?

Would everyone get bored and stop caring about the others' data?

Would people get obsessed and the society homogenized to be really uniform and boring?

Or would artificial intelligence get even more of an advantage as the group/entity capable of maximal utilization of that information soup, and then we'd be all doomed?",11,4,False,self,,,,,

Hybrid species are bound to exist in our futuristic world, this futuristic world is not bound by having flying cars and sky-high buildings, it is rather acceptable to assume that it represents a more mythical elvish-like synchronized society. Within these parameters, hybrid species are to exist and procreate for experimental and medical purposes. There will be a considerable resistance to the mere creation or existence of these hybrid species by species or ideological conservatives at the initial stages of the researches. But it would prove ineffective when governments describe them to be useful for the proliferation of the human race.
I believe we are bound to live, if hybrids are to exist freely, in an unpredictable world were mutated beings are to be spawned when inter-species mating will take role. Might there be a breakout of some intelligent specie, the newly created specie would pose a moral challenge to humanity to either co-exist with the specie or push it towards extinction. The recent creation of a pig capable of maintaining human organs created these assumptions. If, by some accident, we were to implant a human brain into this pig, would we be creating an intelligent specie capable of reasoning and thinking for itself like humans do? If so, then the specie would have a form of consciousness, and this complicates things for people when deciding on how to engage this specie...
What do you humans think?

In it, he challenges two conventions that have arisen in astronomy: dark matter and dark energy. The challenge is largely non-technical, and the logic that he uses has wider applications. 

&gt; The idea that scientific theories contain conventional aspects is attributed to Henri Poincar. From his work on non-Euclidean geometries and higher spaces, Poincar
reached the conclusion that many elements of scientific theories which had been held to be fundamental truths were in fact just conventions. Thus any geometry can be adopted for space, if
the necessary revision is made in the definition of a straight line. The laws of mechanics can
likewise be interpreted as defining the concepts of force and inertial motion. While noting that
some conventions might be more convenient than others, Poincar asserted that any set of
conventions could always be replaced by a different set without changing the content of a theory.
In Poincars view, the parts of a scientific theory that are conventional cannot be said to be
true or false; they are simply definitions, and as such, are immune to testing.

&gt; Karl Popper was concerned with finding a criterion that demarcates science from non-science
(or metaphysics). He argued that falsifiability is such a criterion: scientific theories are falsifiable;
non-falsifiable theories are non-scientific. [...] Popper equated conventionalism with non-falsifiability, and , in part because he saw conventionalism as impeding the growth of knowledge:

Popper defined four ways in which defenders of the conventional can reject challenges to it: to re-define the theory, make ad hoc additions to it (like dark matter or dark energy), ot throw doubt on the accuracy of the data or to attack the motives of the source of the objection ('denialists', 'no platform'). 

Merritt shows that a very strong relationship between the dark matter imputed for a galaxy and its visibel mass is strong and known since the 1980s, but that it has been actively ignored in at least twenty text books. 

This is an example of academic group think, and it is the bane of futures work. We have so few conventions onto which to hang that we fight like starved weasels when someone challenges one of them. Does this seem familiar as a part of /r/Futures? It should. ",4,5,False,self,,,,,

We did not evolve to move at speeds higher than a fast sprint, but we managed well enough with riding horseback and driving cars. Once you add a third dimension to this, however, everything goes to hell. 

We sometimes think it doesn't take much to pilot a plane or helicopter, and that all accidents are simply the fault of computer errors. In fact, the reverse is true take away the computer and try to fly a plane, and you'd be lucky to survive if you aren't stupidly well trained. That's why pilots 50+ years ago were so well paid while pilots today earn peanuts and pennies. There are still several functions of flying that can't quite be automated, but these can be overcome in a time frame of years. Not decades *years*. 

Flying taxis seem to have come out of nowhere. Back in 2013 and 2014, I felt like you could count all discussion of autonomous flying cars even on this subreddit on one hand with several fingers missing. Fast forward just a couple years, and now they're almost as hot of a topic as hyperloops and driverless cars because people realized that crossing helicopters and drones with AV technology is a no-brainer.

Don't get me wrong, we're not going to be riding passenger drones any time this decade save for a few instances energy is still a problem; stealthcopter technology hasn't filtered down to common drones and quadcopters so noise is also still a problem; we've yet to find an optimal build for passenger drones (the current designs look like they'd either decapitate you or make you kiss everything below your torso goodbye); and as I mentioned, we're still a few years away from having computers powerful enough to fully automate travel. Also, ""flying cars"" are likely to not be a thing, hence why you hear about passenger drones (aka drone taxis and flying taxis) making a vehicle that can drive and making a vehicle that can fly requires two totally different design philosophies unless you're willing to accept a dorky transformer-wannabe. 

But it's still something that should be past infancy and at least into childhood by 2025. eHang kicked off a rush to commercialize passenger drones, but a whole slew of comapnies are following them. Airbus, Uber, Alphabet/Google, AeroMobile, and who knows who else. ",2,2,False,self,,,,,

[in-depth],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5y9gj1/i_have_had_and_observation_about_technology_that/,AGameDeveloper,1488996074,"This is about higher degrees of technology so it fits well with futurology but also regards how a meritocracy compliments advancement. So it may be a tiny bit off topic, but this something about the topic I really want to hear from people who have knowledge of future advancements.

So my observation is simple actually. Technology and capitalism appear to have a pattern where after a certain point they dont compliment each other anymore.

If you look at early advancements in technology it appears that it compliments capitalism very well. But as a technology advances there is a point when capitalism diverges from advancement as you continue forward in the timeline.

Its almost like a meritocracy singularity. 

It seems that all forms of technology have different thresholds in this regard. The invention of the light bulb would be one example. Once you advance the technology past a certain point it no longer benefits a corporation so you might see various different behaviors. Such as choosing to not advance the technology further.

Everywhere I look when it comes to technology I see similar patterns. Someone or some group of people invent something super cool, they build considerable profits from its earlier inventions. Then as the technology continues to advance it reaches a point where the incentives to grow the technology would mean a trade off in profits.

This can also come in the form of sustaining existing infrastructure.

This tends to be true across the board as it not only effects profits as a whole but it reduces the need for people to do the same job. This process causes a massive boom in profits then eventually it becomes its own undoing.

Large corporations lose control over the ability to dictate how the technology is used. Individuals grow in power over time and eventually it seems like everyone ends up on equal footing. Compare something like CNN vs a person with a web camera and a microphone on Youtube. We are currently seeing an entire medium shift right now.

Youtube is a great example of this as google seems to barely even break even in terms of profits. Youtube is definitely a form of high technology but it is currently losing money.

Open source software seems like its almost an affront to capitalism. As you cant actually own what you work on. Since there is money in making a super amazing version of Linux very few people with the skill to do so even try. Ultimately it would be ideal for open source software to be a dominant force on all fronts but people avoid it because its more profitable to reinvent the wheel.

Solar panels are definitely something I envision hitting a meritocracy singularity very quickly. 

3D printers also run the risk of hitting a meritocracy singularity extremely quickly.

I cannot possibly be the only to see this I think. So I am wondering if maybe my thoughts on the topic can be debunked or if anyone can provide further insight I would really appreciate it.",38,5,False,self,,,,,

I didn't feel that as strongly 5 or 10 years ago. So I'm wondering, is it just a subjective perception or is it to some extent objectively true? After all, the rate of progress has been mind-boggling in the last 2 centuries, perhaps it's just the fact that I follow science more now and notice progress more, or some other random effect. Do people on average feel more ""futuristic"" than, say, 10 or 30 years ago?

Some reasons why I do:

- Sustainable energy is replacing fossils at peak rate. Electric cars are quickly gaining ground.
- Self-driving tech with 1 human intervention per 5000 miles.
- Artificial intelligence, automation.
- Orbital rockets can land back on Earth. There's an emerging private space industry.
- We can read human DNA for $1000, many orders of magnitude cheaper than not that long ago. We can also design a DNA on a computer, synthesise it and insert into a biological cell.
- Lot of small things such as the fact that I can charge my phone and laptop with the same USB-C charger, and use the same cable to connect to a 4K monitor.",6,10,False,self,,,,,

The reports say that these tools are already far superior to doctors, but I'm a bit cynical. I don't doubt for a second that this is the future of healthcare, it's obvious that they are. What I'm less sure about is their quality TODAY. The reports might be the result of marketing teams misrepresenting results, or intentionally making bad comparisons to incorrect metrics to get the conclusion they want. You know what I mean, it's getting harder to trust the media, even moreso when it comes to hyped technology.

Have you been to a clinic that used one of these computers to diagnose you? Or do you work at such a clinic, perhaps? What are your impressions?

Also, let's say this plane had its computers malfunctioned and you connected to it from the ground, it's a recipe for disaster since you can't reliably make anything that can be connected wirelessly safe from hackers. Like 50 9/11s in the same day wouldn't be pretty.

Also I don't see why would an airline wouldn't be able to spare a single employee to its multi hundred million dollar, multi hundred ton metal tube that carries hundreds of people above tens of thousands of feet of ground at 600 miles per hour. Just a single dude that makes sure everything is okay. First officer can be ruled out by automation just like the flight engineer had been in 80s, but there has to be that single guy who monitors the entire operation, even if he doesn't intervene in anything at all _under normal conditions._

Sure, the nature of piloting will change, they might become more like IT managers/computer programmers(some people say they already are but no, I'm sorry but still a lot of piloting is involved in commercial flying), just make sure automated computer systems do everything correctly. I see really no benefits from airline side about ruling out a single guy with an average wage, when fuel alone in a single flight costs like his 10 year total wage already.

And above all, a software can't take responsibility, it can't be held at court nor it can be forced to make a decision about the lives of hundreds of people. Unless that computer passes the Turing test, there'll always have to be a person that makes decisions and holds responsibility.

NOTE: This might be an unpopular opinion, please look past our potential disagreement(s) and do contribute if you've got a solid concept.
The post isn't about sex per se, but companionship and meaning.

I've had enough experiences with today's dating to say that 99% of women are poor relationship material for the majority of men, and vice versa.
Most common friction points are: lack of appreciation, fickleness and infidelity, but they all stem from a lack of shared values.
Generalising - men want stability, women want passion.

Solving this glaring contradiction might require subtle tweaks or more radical approaches.
Assuming physical aspects have been handled by things like cosmetic surgery and metabolism alterations and money isn't as important due to automation, here are some ideas:

1. DNA matching - A service that couples people by contrasting their DNA makeup, tendencies &amp; preferences.
2. Genomics (CRISPR/Cas9) - Altering the least appreciated parts of one's personality to better cater to each others needs.
3. This one will probably raise a lot of issues:
Partner design - Having a human embryo modeled into your soulmate.
I don't make this suggestion lightheartedly or without consideration for the ethical implications, I'd imagine this would be done with a lot of forethought and pure intentions. (Edit: Not condoning paedophilia by any means, just a general theory, I believe the details of such procedure would either make or break it on a moral ground.)

I would like to leave the topic of sexbots out of the picture, since even a sentient AI would be very hard to relate to for most people, not having our problems and insecurities.

For problems that require combing through a search space for the optimum solution.

My limited understand of Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLs) is the concept of interconnected network of switches that have inputs and produce outputs.  To train the network you put in positive and negative inputs which allow the network to be adjusted to match the desired output.

So IMHO a DL involves searching a space for the best configuration for the network of neurons to produce the desired output from the inputs.

Therefore could QC give DLs a massive boost in learning performance?

What about a boost in performance when running, could a QC 'compress' multiple simulated neurons requiring less processing and less hardware?",5,24,False,self,,,,,

Here's a quick guide to reading all the books,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5z7nqn/the_culture_series_might_offer_the_best_look_at_a/,PM_ME_UR_Definitions,1489438414,"The Culture series by Ian M. Banks (r/theculture) is an excellent 10 book sci-fi series. It covers a wide range of different kinds of stories and characters, and is all tied together by the backdrop of a society called *The Culture* which is approaching the limits of technological progress in this universe and is an ""interstellar anarchist utopian society ...  composed of several inter-bred humanoid species, as well as artificially intelligent sentient machines, with intelligences ranging from human-equivalent drones, to hyper-intelligent Minds."" These books give an interesting and unique look at a distant future that comes about after people embrace AI, and more importantly the kind of philosophy and society that would both allow for and be created by those choices.

The books take place hundreds of years apart, most have no characters in common, and it's often recommended not to read them in order, so it can be confusing where to start and what to expect. I just finished rereading the series again, and put together this quick guide for people who want to get in to it. All the books provide a great counterpoint to the often negative views of an AI future we hear today. I've broken up the 10 books in to a three ""trilogies"" (plus a bonus):

**The Intro Trilogy or ""Don't Fuck with The Culture.""** Any of these books make a great intro to the series and the ideas that really make it tick. All three of these offer a different perspective on what the society of The Culture is like, this is the order I'd read them in:

* *Matter* - this is one of the later books published in the series, but I think it makes a good intro because it starts out on a planet of medieval technology and introduces more layers of technology and species building up the The Culture.
* *The Player of Games* - this is one of the most popular books in the series and one that often gets recommended. It features another society that's more technologically advanced than us, but still not nearly as advanced as The Culture.
* *Look to Windward* - this has much less ""action"" than the others and mostly takes place on a peaceful Culture habitat, and gives a good look at ""day to day"" life and their interaction with a society that's close to equivalent technology.

**The Early Books or ""If they had not been so unconcerned with power for its own sake, they would have been terribly feared.""** These are three of the first four books published and are probably the most varied of the entire series. They also all have the least amount of story actually taking place with The Culture or their citizens.

* *Consider Phlebas* - if you've seen *Firefly* you'll recognize this style of story (which was published in 1987). It takes place in the same universe as the rest of the books, but features almost no characters from The Culture. It's the first book published, but most people recommend not to read it first since it's so different than the rest. It does make a very interesting point about a society's reasons for going to war though.
* *Use of Weapons* - another fan favorite from the series. It features a character that's not part of The Culture, but interacts/""does business"" with them over a number of years.
* *The State of the Art* - a collection of short stories, some weird, some wonderful. The story that gives the book its title is the only time Earth is mentioned in the entire series.

**The Space Operas or ""Terrific Things The Culture And Its Brilliant Ships Had Got Up To Over The Years""**. These are my personal three favorite of the series. They're grander and more complex stories and heavily feature many AI characters. If you just wanted to read a couple of the best of the series you could start here, but I think they're much more enjoyable with a little intro to the universe they take place in first.

* *Excession* - one of the few times that The Culture runs up against technology more advanced than themselves. Also, ships (or ""Minds"") make up most of the characters.
* *Surface Detail* - this really explores the idea of being able to capture mind states, and also has one of my favorite ship characters in the series.
* *The Hydrogen Sonata* - a perfect book to end the ""official"" series on, it was the last published, is one of the funnest/funniest books in the series (along with *Matter* in my opinion), and has lots of interesting interactions with other civilizations.

**The Other One** - *Inversions* is technically part of the Culture series, even though it takes place entirely in medieval society and never explicitly mentions any other planet or technology more advanced than muskets. Also you'd miss a lot of the story if you hadn't read any other books in the series first, so it really doesn't stand on its own as well as any of the rest. It's completely different than the rest of the books, but is a fun read, especially when you're sad that there's no more new books.",22,98,False,self,,,,,

What I mean by this is an AI that is always there to help you tune into channels that it knows you will like or that will help you improve yourself whether physically or intelligently.

This AI can be extended into the internet and help you browse YouTube, Netflix, or even Facebook more intelligently.

 I could forsee a future like this where Google, Amazon, and Facebook intelligently compute and program the masses, rather than dumb them down like TV has been doing.

If robots going to replace all labor. And basic income is introduced. People will lose incentive to study.  Most of the people who study, are studying because they hope of getting better job and pay. If there are no jobs, people will have no incentive to study. Therefore full automation going to introduce dumb next generation.

For instance, you can see what happens to rich people who either get their money from parents, or inherritence. Most of the rich people turn out to be dropouts. Similarly would happen to next generation who get free money.

I can't think of a single scenarion where humannity could go through with full automation.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-obama-fuel-economy-standards.html?_r=0

It just doesn't matter that increased mileage standards save consumers money at the gas pump, make Americans less dependent on oil, reduce carbon pollution and advance innovation.

If automakers would boost fleet-wide average fuel efficiency to 54.5 mpg, it would save motorists $1.7 trillion in total fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and would only cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. 

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-autos-idUSKBN16K1L5?il=0

Please remember that the auto industry spends over $10 billion a year on advertising.  Therefore, in 10 years hence, they will have spent $100 billion hawking their gas-guzzling cars and trucks. 

http://www.autonews.com/article/20160628/RETAIL03/160629852/automakers-rank-high-on-annual-ad-spending-list 

It is obvious automakers simply don't care how much consumers can save on gas, they just care about profit at all costs.  The automakers write Even today, no conventional vehicle today meets that target  (54.5 mpg).  However, this statement is simply false and misleading.  

Chevy advertises that their 2017 Bolt goes 238 miles on a full charge (60kWh).  
http://www.chevrolet.com/bolt-ev-electric-vehicle.html

This is the equivalent of getting 3.97 miles per kWh.  Therefore, if the price of electricity were a relatively expensive 12 cents per kWh and if the price of gasoline were a relatively cheap $3.00 per gallon, then a car that uses gasoline (which is a byproduct of oil) would have to get 101 miles per gallon of gasoline to be equivalent (the cost per mile for each is 3 cents) (see calculations below).  

One should ask oneself, who doesn't want to get 101 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent when they fill up at the gas station?   Conversely, if your local gas station advertised 50%+ off your gas bill, wouldn't the queue be around the block?

* The formula for the cost (in dollars) to drive an internal combustion vehicle vs. the cost to drive an electric vehicle is as follows (where^ -1 means the reciprocal, or 1 divided by the variable):

*  Internal combustion engine-- [(x miles per gallon) * (y dollars per gallon)^-1]^-1 = z dollars per mile.  Plug in electric vehicle-- [(a miles per kWh)^-1 * (b dollars per kWh)] = c dollars per mile.  If z &lt; c, then the internal combustion engine is cheaper to drive, if z &gt; c then the electric is cheaper to drive.

*  Likewise, [(d miles per gallon) * (e miles per kWh)^-1 * (f dollars per kWh)] = g dollars per gallon gasoline equivalent for driving an electric vehicle. If g &lt; the current price of a gallon of gasoline, then the electric vehicle is cheaper to drive.

""To amend an old saying: Bad presidents make bad law. Because President Trump is behaving in an unprecedented way, Watson feels called upon also to behave in an unprecedented way. In order to defend a constitutional valueequal treatment of all American religionsWatson has issued an order that corrodes the constitutional system itself. Its a lose-lose proposition, because either way a constitutional norm would be weakened before the world.

Watsons imaginative reasoning in Hawaii v. Trump asserts a new judicial power to disregard formal law if the presidents personal words create a basis for mistrusting his motives.""

My friend posted this snipped on Facebook and linked to this Atlantic article: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-hawaii-judge-set-a-dangerous-precedent/519828/?utm_source=atltw

Out of context, I thought the quote referred to IBM's Watson. It turns out that was the Judge's last name (Derrick Watson). However, reading it thinking it was IBM's machine doesn't feel too far off as the AI is developed into assisting legal decisions. 

Perhaps an AI would be MORE adept at determining the long term outcome and justification from unprecedented behaviour; but, do we even want to allow for unprecedented behavior? Imagine the debate about this article! 
If we don't, what's the point of super-intelligence? 

Looking at AI as a distribution of expertise (i.e. diagnostics at the 98% human level spread widely across the earth at a low cost) rather than a surpassing of human expertise feels a lot more reasonable and desirable.

tl;dr: It's fun reading this article imagining they are talking about IBM's Watson rather than Judge Derrick Watson.",3,3,False,self,,,,,

Particularly very near future,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5zykyi/what_is_your_ideal_personal_future_particularly/,worklunch2,1489768043,"To give this context, let me write some of my ideas, and what not, I would like to say the following. 




I think that my ideal future is to work from home most of the time.




I'd like to buy stuff online rather than go to stores for stuff, which I can do now, but it has been risky with electronics and clothes so far. I am batting like 500 on stuff that breaks a day after I get it, shrinks, or smells. 




I think I would like an electric car, but I think my ideal is to just have an old school simple big engine in my current truck's body. I don't want to put exhaust into the air. I do like those engines though, and the nostalgia of them in their simplicity compared to the electronics of today in my truck. This stems mostly from me being an engineer and not agreeing with decisions made in most stuff revolving around my engine I suppose. 




I'd like a shingled roof without the sound of rain hitting the solar panels others dream of I think. I would like a huge wind turbine not too far or close to my place. 





I don't want to see people at the gas station, or when I go places and could be served without interfacing with people. I don't mind seeing other people getting served, but I prefer to have that part automated. 






I am pretty curious what others will say they like. I wonder what stuff I don't know about considering that might be good or that I might be able to check out now. 




I mean it is pretty close to the things I want now. The engine thing not so much. Delivery of goods I want without going anywhere is on the spot for now. I could get food that way too I guess. That seems like a big risk to me though.

A lot of people are thinking of it as a ""Charge sharing"" technology, rather than ""Charging"" technology.

""Charge Sharing"" is just one part of the big picture, but the NFC charge technology is actually a revolutionizing way how the manufacturers will start implementing it in their products.

If you look at the Sony's ecosystem, most of its product carry a NFC chip, Imagine a case where you will be able to get your phone charged just by placing it over your audio system, or you are on a trip and your camera runs out of charge and rather than replacing battery, you can just hold your phone close to camera and take the shots(and replace battery in free time).

The bigger market will be of phone cases, most of the phone cases will start shipping with a sleek in-built battery which will charge and discharge along with the phone itself.

And of course the one thing that could be read in almost every post related to Sony's wireless charging tech, Manufacturers can build power banks with built in NFC chip.

External Accessories like Sony's external camera lens and sensor that pairs with phone(I don't know why they did not developed them further) will no longer need an in-built battery, or will carry a very small battery needed to take shots when the lens is not attached to phone itself.

In a future where homes will have IoT devices in common use(rather than just show off) we will have everything from, stove, microwave, fridge, dining tables(maybe, Who knows) everything NFC-fied, we may even stop using our charging brick, or may even remove the usb port from the phone(please don't do that).

Or, think of a wall, that have nfc chips built in at certain points, we will actually be able to hang our gorgeous Bravia's without connecting it with a Wire, and a lot of home appliances just hanging around(hehehe)
Now that's BIG.",2,5,False,self,,,,,

I know that the capital investment for this  type of thing would be enormous, but what are our respective governments there for if not to let us pool our resources to make the big investments that are needed for our society to thrive? (public utility)

Automation seems to be threatening the foundations of our economy. So why not use it to solve the very scary issues that we see on the horizon. If everyone was guarantied a healthy diet and housing provided by their local government, would unemployment really be an issue?

&gt;&gt;Efficiency isnt much fun. In a world dominated by efficiency, each development would serve only narrow and practical purposes. 

&gt;Beauty, creativity,  fantasy, enjoyment, inspiration, and poetry would fall by the wayside, creating  an unappealing world indeed.... An efficient world is not one we envision as  delightful.

====

Alfred von Schlieffen, the architect of the German Empire's plan to invade France, called a very beautiful stream 'a minor obstacle'. 

(His plan was perfect but it was hopelessly botched by the younger Moltke after his death in 1913 (tl.dr. Schlieffen said it was necessary to invade Holland's maastricht region to get around the fort at Liege; Moltke thought it was better to leave Holland neutral. Well, if the war was won, there was no need to keep Holland neutral to begin with! If his plan were not botched, we would have reached the Saturn by 1969.

I stand with my opinion that the European youths killed in 1914-1918 were irreplaceable, and no amount of Americans, Japanese, Chinese and other whatnots could replace them. The scientific contribution of USA before 1914 was comparable to that of, uhm, Spain.)

Such is the mind needed for singularity and the new stage of civilization.

Today's world is financialized. There is no slack for inefficiency, idealism, mercy, independence, beauty, individual opinion, or anything which does not increase economic value.

Instead, the leaders of the future will think like von Schlieffen, with no slack for anything but profit. That means no slack for the poor, no slack for the less fortunate, et al.

The super-efficient, financialized future will look like a Soviet propaganda film without all the bad things, and the less fit in the system safely edited out from anything 'good'.

The techno-commercial, which some people call techno-feudal, future will be bland, uninteresting and trite, but the advancement of technology will compensate that and there will be newer worlds to conquer.

it may not be too fun, forgiving or interesting, but its advancement will compensate for all these blandness.

The world is like an automatic pilot, with the only certain thing is the advancement of tech and getting closer to space conquest and singularity. All other activities will probably end since they do not add economic value too much.",1,4,False,self,,,,,

However, I do see with the automation posts how it's going to replace labor and make business owners who can afford the automation incredibly rich. That will not happen because I cannot be the only person that knows that if all labor is replaced then where is the money being made to purchase the products being autonomously created? Let me put it simpler, if someone can't make money how are they gonna have money to buy a product made by a robot? They won't. So either everything has to be free or labor has to be a thing. Sure you can have jobs to clean/maintain the robot systems make sure everything is working properly but labor can never be fully replaced like some people are saying, because there's no way that anyone will make their products free. Feel free to tell me anything otherwise and discuss in the comments. Cheers.",5,4,False,self,,,,,

Here - the timeline I am looking at is in the far future, this being a semi/quasi-hypothetical alternate timeline.

This topic has been discussed before, as [seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5cw79j/would_a_completely_cashless_and_currencyless/) but here I am looking at [taking apart the idea and pointing out its flaws - or as TVTropes calls it - deconstruction](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction).

If I'm being honest here, a completely cashless society would probably be unnerving to me, maybe because of things I've learnt like advice from Martin Lewis, a British financial journalist, who had stated [cannot fully remember the source] ""Cash in your hand is a visual reminder of what you're spending, and a useful thing"" [paraphrasing this].

Perhaps because the concept of paying in notes seems like second-nature to many people, it could be seen as strange in the future to some people to not pay in cash [the methods used in the Roman Empire of paying in silver bars seems like time immemorial to most of us].

I do online banking, like most people, but, for example, if you've gone into a branch of Poundland, Marks &amp; Spencers or Tesco's, and bought a sandwich, a packet of crisps, a bottle of water [as some commuters like me do], isn't it easier to pay in cash than get the credit card out?

I'm not saying online banking etc. should not exist, but that there is room for both cash and online banking - a best-of-both-worlds scenario, possibly.

How would you feel if, in the far future, a descendant of you, never paying in physical cash, and it all done by online or AI means?

I would be interested to know what you think about the future of this issue - as it is probably an important topic to discuss on here - and what you think the advantages and disadvantages are of a cashless society?",4,3,False,self,,,,,

The rest had barely enough to eat and survive.

And that era showed the greatest advance of science, tech and everything else.

The world wars killed a lot of valuable people while arming lots of masses so the upper class had to pay attention to the armed mobs. However, times have changed, and now the masses are militarily irrelevant.

As the economy becomes non-participatory, and all the gains and fruits concentrated in few hands, I expect a massive split between those 'techno-literate' and the rest soon.

There will be sporadic rebellions and violence but they will be brutally crushed, and the remainders will live quiet, poor and irrelevant lives like a lot of Japanese today, and will most likely die without reproducing like the post-famine Irish non-landowners. (Ireland pop continued to decline all the way till the 1960s)

The big companies which run the world do not care about human costs - they only care about dividends to the wealthier stockholders. A lot of human suffering will occur, but the well-conditioned writers in the advanced regions will ignore them since it won't benefit them. 

Reducing the rest of the world to abject poverty helps the future by conserving valuable resources which can be used for better purposes.

Tl.dr. There might be a few seats remaining in the lifeboat which will lead us to the new civilization, but billions of current humans won't make it and like Caledon Hockley said, ""not the better 100 million.""",8,0,False,self,,,,,

AMA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/619hqw/my_local_walmart_just_opened_an_automated_grocery/,NazzerDawk,1490368453,"I don't know how much the basic grocery pickup service has proliferated across America and the world, but some of you may be aware that Wal-Mart offers a grocery pickup service. 

The way this works is you order your stuff on the walmart grocery app or website, you schedule a pickup time, someone gathers your items, and then you arrive at the arranged time and they load the stuff into your car.

I used this service a few times, and couldn't help but feel it was an intermediate step. Why do I need someone else loading groceries into my car? 

Well that exact concern has been addressed. In Oklahoma City of all places, just a quick two miles from my house, Wal-Mart built a small building in front of the main location.

This building has 4 large metal doors. I scheduled a pickup here last friday, and drove up just before 8 o clock. 

The door I drove up to looked a bit like an elevator door, though it had a touchscreen kiosk next to it. I entered my pickup code on the Kiosk, then the doors opened after some mechanical sounds and I saw three blue crates, with my groceries loaded loosely amoung them, already bagged.

The air emerging from the unloading door was chilled, making it clear the building is fully refrigerated.  I emptied this first set of crates into my car, but then an alert stated there was a problem and I would have to move to another door.

I did so, but a man walked up to me and asked how things are going. This is the lead programmer for this project, and he noticed the problem after I did.

Turns out his colleague, an engineer, had entered the building unaware someone was picking up groceries at that moment. He apologized, we tried another door, but the order still wouldn't complete.

So, he offered to... manually load the remaining stuff into my car.

Lol.

This is just the first week this has been opened, so I am very comfortable offering the whole experience some slack, and as he loads the groceries I ask him what stage the rollout of these automated pickup locations is.

He tells me that this is the first such location in America, and only the third in the world.

I read and write a lot about automation, so I twll him I am excited about the prospect, thank him for his work, and wish him luck.

I plan to go again soon, and this time I will record a video of the whole experience. 

Hopefully it will be smoother than last time.

We've been brainwashed by Hollywood (spoilers, they don't know sh!t about what they write most of the time when science is involved) to believe this is the end of humanity. Everyone is obsessed with some apocalyptic thing happening. What happened to the optimism that put humanity on the moon? That we can do anything. 
What happened to the hopefuls that this age of AI could bring us to beyond what we thought ourselves possible? They could usher us to the next steps of our evolution. 
Let me be clear, I don't mean simply cyborgs. I mean as a species we have so much potential that is going to wastes as is right now, maybe if we had something that can see beyond the differences we can't, maybe they can walk us along the path we need to go down as a species to ensure our survival beyond the next few hundred years.

Of course, there will be some awkwardly designed and uncivilized technology showing up that gets in the way of us being free (to follow our dreams), but the vast majority of tech that we invent and discover and share will make life significantly better, for all of us living organisms.

We just need to remember what we are trying to accomplish with our work, and *focus on making sure that what we are doing is aimed at allowing us to do more of what we living beings most love to do* (and less of the stuff that we are only conned into doing using money or similar meaningless competitive game systems, as in those things we tend to call ""jobs"").

Once all humans are at least as free from the ""rat race"" as all the other species on the planet are  to do whatever unique kinds of work we *want* to do  then our planet will seriously see an explosion of excellence.

My argument is based on the idea that these 5 personality traits were harnessed to their logical limits during the space race and now they must be redirected for a new generation.

The carrot that got us to the moon was science and the stick was the USSR. Nowadays neither is a justification of maned spaceflight and here's why. 


 
Agreeableness- A personality trait that should be defined as being perfectly on board with the space flight agenda WRONG!!! 

The problem is simple it's not that agreeable people are against spaceflight, its that's they'll settle for less at every corner. ""What we no longer have a shuttle, I can agree to that!. 

Neuroticism: This trait was the first to be harnessed during the space race however 55 years later we are still dealing with the repercussions of picking that low hanging fruit. People that are largely motivated by fear tend not to be explorers. 

When dealing with fear the best remedy is knowledge. For every challenge we face in spaceflight there's a rather obvious solution. Don't like radiation, do you realise that water is one of the best shields, did you also know that  comets not only pose a risk to our planets safety but they are also rich in water?

Openness to experience: Say it ain't so! how can a personality trait that values exploration be a problem. During the space race the american government went wild funding propaganda films like 2001 a space odessesy. 

So what went wrong?

It's simple openness to experience means your generally open to every kind of experience not a set one. Spaceflight isn't an all warp drives and green alien babes in thongs, getting into orbit is a narrow keyhole and threading that need takes direction. Sure once we thread the need society will follow but for the time being we need these people looking through that keyhole and not the glass window that is popular science fiction. 


Extroversion: Extroverts love being where the action is and they are all about developing new friendships. During the space race these are the people that romanticised watch their pal Neil waddle down the ladder. 

However the problem is these people don't like being bummed out by a half century of stagnation. If we are to get these people in on the spaceflight community we have to make it known that their is actually a special bond that they are missing out on.

Conscientious: Probably the most important trait to harness if we are gonna become a space-faring civilisation, yet it often represents the biggest challenge. During the space race these were the people who couldn't stomach the thought that the communist were out performing us as it represented a stain of bile on their moral fabric. 

People who are conscientious  value following the rules, working hard,independence, overcoming adversity  and responsibility. People with this trait make the ideal astronauts yet they are often our biggest obstacle to manned spaceflight. 

Why because they value utility. Everything has a purpose and anything outside of that purpose is a waste of time. Once we beat the russians they didn't see the utility of sending humans. 


So what can be done? Well the short answer is we need to address the problem of spaceflight not as political or economic one but a psychological  in nature. 


People that score high on conscientious avoid patterns of behaviour that they find distasteful. To persuade them you must explain to them why the current path is wrong. The utility of spaceflight isn't science, its maintaining the moral hygiene of the species. A society that doesn't work towards it's expansion is a society that sits in its own filth.

Yup. They are the qualifications for future drivers, who will care for nothing, will not waste time on the less intelligent, less fortunate and less wealthy.

One thing I don't agree with the Grey Enlightenment guy is that he chooses to ignore the resource shortage problem for whatever reason, while I think it is a very acute problem which has to be dealt with (i.e. a massive reduction of living standards in countries and states with less than an average IQ of 100)

Georgia guidestones directed a world pop of 500m. It also used some languages, such as Swahili, which won't be used in the future since I don't think Swahili will survive the transition to the future.


I think that with improved tech, 100m will suffice. Curiously it coincides with the number of people who were relevant and were in the economic system before the Great War.",2,4,False,self,,,,,

What seems strange to me is that there is another discussion, which has been going on since before AI automation got so much attention, about the labour deficit that will hit almost all developed nations due to falling birth rates and ageing workforce. So, on the one hand we have some people who predict massive unemployment caused by AI and on the other people who predict massive labour shortages caused by falling birth rates.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-27/california-s-clean-air-problem-is-a-lot-bigger-than-just-trump

The premise of the article is summed up as: Is it physically possible? Yes. Economically likely? No 

To me, this is puzzling, because it is currently an ECONOMIC REALITY that electric vehicles are over 50% cheaper to drive (once the car is driven off the lot) than an equivalent gas powered vehicle (please see below for convenient calculations).   

* The formula for the cost (in dollars) to drive an internal combustion vehicle vs. the cost to drive an electric vehicle is as follows (where^ -1 means the reciprocal, or 1 divided by the variable):

*  Internal combustion engine-- [(x miles per gallon) * (y dollars per gallon)^-1]^-1 = z dollars per mile.  Plug in electric vehicle-- [(a miles per kWh)^-1 * (b dollars per kWh)] = c dollars per mile.  If z &lt; c, then the internal combustion engine is cheaper to drive, if z &gt; c then the electric is cheaper to drive.

*  Likewise, [(d miles per gallon) * (e miles per kWh)^-1 * (f dollars per kWh)] = g dollars per gallon gasoline equivalent for driving an electric vehicle. If g &lt; the current price of a gallon of gasoline, then the electric vehicle is cheaper to drive.  

According to the manufacturer, the #olt can go 238 miles on a full charge (60kWh).  

This is the equivalent of getting 3.97 miles per kWh.  Therefore, if the price of electricity were a relatively expensive 12 cents per kWh and if the price of gasoline were a relatively cheap $3.00 per gallon, then a car that uses gasoline would have to get 101 miles per gallon of gasoline to be equivalent (the cost per mile for each is 3 cents).  

One should ask oneself, who doesn't want to get 101+ miles per gallon gasoline equivalent when they fill up at the gas station?   Conversely, if your local gas station advertised 50%+ off your gas bill, wouldn't the queue be around the block?  

If I wanted to make the case for increasing the number of zero emissions vehicles in California, then wouldn't it behoove me to mention that YOU CAN CURRENTLY SAVE: (1) over 20 lbs of smog producing emissions per gallon of gasoline consumed, (2) half a gallon of gasoline per hour of city driving (because EVs don't idle), and (3) over 50% off the cost to drive (by switching to electric)?  

Did you know that the sticker price of EVs can be quite low as well?:

That robots will cause a massive change to the labor market in the next few decades is pretty much a given.  Obviously this will have far reaching impacts for the human race, from reproduction to religion, but I've been thinking recently about one specific topic.

If mass unemployment is going to be a defining characteristic of the future, do you think it would be better to outright own a home (i.e.no mortgage, only property tax and upkeep costs) or own no home (i.e. rent) but a relatively large investment portfolio (say $1million + in present day value)?

However, the article makes certain points that are worth thinking about before the enthusiasm gets out of hand: Namely that market cap is a measure of stock value rather than necessarily the fundamentals of a company, although those too are continuously increasing for Tesla as it builds out its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, solar panel factory in New York, and various other facilities.

Ford remains overwhelmingly dominant compared to Tesla in its pace of manufacturing and delivery, and yet the news is a milestone in a trend that has been unfolding for years.  Tesla has been continuously advancing its ability to produce, and despite occasional dips in stock price, the stock has kept well ahead of the shockwave.

A company that was not supposed to exist according to...well...*everyone*...now has a market capitalization of $45 billion, after a decade and a half of growth and hard-fought survival at times.  But here's where the future interest comes into light: Tesla is no longer ""merely"" a car company.

Tesla is growing both up and down its own supply chain - expanding across its own entire industrial sector - entering the energy production, energy storage, and energy management industries that will increase the value of its cars.  It is also *creating* an entire industrial science of the factory-as-product, rooted in designing whole factories as if they were single products limited only by the basic laws of physics.

A lot of OEM companies extend tendrils into their own supply chains, but these are usually just hedges - they maintain a basic capacity to serve their own needs if a major supplier has a serious interruption.  And, of course, as leverage in negotiations with their suppliers if someone is trying to strong-arm them.  That is not what Tesla is doing.

Tesla is out for conquest.  Having watched this company evolve since a decade ago, and watched its vision evolve, I can say that it intends - over the longest term - to become the world's dominant producer of clean energy infrastructure, related systems, and the building and transport technologies that utilize it.

Disaster is entirely possible when ambitions are so grand, and Tesla has averted it so often that one has to wonder if Musk's genius is not mixed in with some strain of adrenaline-driven recklessness, but sooner or later you have to admit that the best guide to what someone will achieve in the future is what they have already achieved in the past.

Tesla has the tools, the talent, and the ambition to own the world.  I think they will.  They will change the energy and transport systems of the world, and possibly the basic way in which we manufacture on a large scale.  Over decades, I think they will surpass all other automakers, and then surpass them all *combined*, beginning to then challenge companies like Apple and Google - who have themselves shown awareness of the danger by experimenting with entering the auto market.  The world's first trillion-dollar company may be among us.

But knock on wood.  Knock on it soundly.",2849,34026,False,self,,,,,

If the hash doesn't match then the exchange isn't valid. That's extremely simple though. Another example I've come across was that if you were standing on a street, and a piano fell on you, the 20 or so people around could verify the event. What time it fell, the distance, color. Giving validity to the event. 

I think one element that our society will require is something similar. We see this on the biological scale (see [exonucleolytic proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading_(biology))), so it makes sense that we transfer this over in a society sense. We also see this with computers now (see [Checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum)), and it's a good bet that AI will require it as well, especially when the two merge.

With the onslaught of fake news, fake photos and video, and soon even altered audio (see [photoshop for audio](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/adobe-voco-photoshop-for-audio-speech-editing/)), it seems we need to start thinking about how we can build the tools to verify our world. How to verify what we see, and what we do, and the things that influence how we think. Once we can say, ""that's mathematically correct"", in regards to ANY subject, media or other, then we're on the right path. 

This goes beyond just science, which is a great tool for understanding our world. But let's dream of the next step, using science as a starting point. 

The example I gave above with the piano still has it's flaws. The human brain can deceive us, and even if we see something happen not all the data is being recorded correctly. The data can be influenced by human error. 

I dream of a day that we're all connected, where we move beyond our flawed biology. But until then I still have to carry on with those who are misinformed, lie, cheat, and those who suffer from it all. If humanity had a blockchain for our very existence, who knows what we can do.

Henry Ford thought his workers should be able to buy his Model T.

Kulm says bullshit. The foxconn employees who assemble Iphones can't buy them, although they will probably buy cheapo Chinese phones.

In fact I think the world wasted too much resources making cheaper goods available to too many people.

Again, I say that the world was closer to singularity in 1913 than in 2017. Economic singularity was just around the corner, and tech was advancing much faster than what is today.

But too many young people were wantonly murdered by the Great War, and a lot of survivors were disillusioned and wasted their lives in pleasure or radical activities, instead of advancing civilization.

that slack was filled by Americans, who basically had to relearn how to create wheels. 

Plus, the existence of millions of people , many in the colonies, having military experience meant more of the economic gains had to be redistributed to the commoners who would not advance civilization but would spend the resources to better their meagre situation.

====

I welcome economic singularity, in which most of the world's wealth will be concentrated into the hands of the tech darlings and some landowners, so more of such wealth could be invested to advancing civilization.

Sure, some of the money will be used on luxury goods. However, they will be high-tech luxury goods. Like IoT Prada whose color will change automatically during an event.

Extreme inequality limits the use of resources by those who are not likely to advance civilization, which saves the dwindling resources for better use.

North Korea already proved that one could have nukes and satellites while the people drove oxcarts and wood-burning 'vehicles'.

https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/how-north-korea-fuels-its-military-trucks-with-trees/

Hopefully, the civilization-drivers will be able to keep the riff-raff, who would live like how their great-grandparents lived, at bay while they finish up spacefaring crafts. 

Tl.dr: Extreme inequality limits the resource spent on non-essential parts of the population, while expanding the amount of money and material which could be used to further future expansion.",5,0,False,self,,,,,

A question came up as I started talking to my fiance about Home Automation and adding some Smart Home Gadgets to our new condo.

She's fine with a few small things, probably getting a Nest G3 to start.

The issue comes as I tell her all about all the different kinds of ways you can automate your life (not necessarily home automation): Automatic door locks, sprinkler systems, smart lighting systems, IFTTT sensors triggering events, et al. Even things as simple as bill autopay!

I've also shown her how technology is developing and we are now (and in the near future) getting: Self Driving cars (Tesla), automated grocery shopping (Amazon Prime Fresh), drone delivery, and everything else of the like.

Her fear is that all these things are making us lazier people and we'll end up living like the people in Wall-E, having robots doing our bidding and never needing to make any physical effort to complete a task.

My argument is that as humanity develops technologically as a race and our culture gradually moves away from the necessity of performing these tasks, due to the growth of automation and Artifical Intelligence, we will be left with more time to pursue more personal endeavors. More time with family, more time to learn and grow the mind and body, etc.

Given the processing power of modern CPUs and GPUs, I believe this form of philanthrophy has a relatively high impact-to-cost ratio. The cost of donating processing time is merely the electricity costs of running the processor at capacity. One can think of this aspect as traditional philanthropy. You're buying electricity instead of them doing it, so it's basically a cash transfer. *However, you are also donating underutilised capital* in the form of your processors. Given you would not be using it during the daytime anyhow, it comes at zero marginal cost to you, but is a great benefit to the non-profit.

In other words, if you are going to give money to charity, it is more effective to give $300 to a charity in the form of distributed computing (electricity costs + capital capacity donation), rather than a straight dollar donation which does not come with non-monetary benefits.

However, there exist many different projects in the distributed computing world. These range from protein folding, to searching for extra-terrestrial life, to solar cell research and more. While in the traditional world of philanthropy, there exist many organisations that provide guidance on maximising the efficiency of donated dollars, has any organisation done a similar analysis for distributed computing projects?

Ultimately, my question is: **for a given hour of donated computing time, which projects are likely to have the greatest long-term impact?** Since the majority of distributed computing projects contribute towards futurist goals, I believe this is a very relevant question for the futurist community. Unlike traditional philanthropy whose costs and benefits are concentrated in the near-term, evaluating the likely pay-offs from many of the distributed computing projects is squarely in the realm of futurists. I greatly appreciate any contribution here! Ultimately my goal is advice on which distributed computing project to donate my processing time towards.

My framework for thinking about this is:
Distributed Computing Project Efficiency (Impact / Hour Computing) = [ (Expected value of project if success)*(Likelihood given X hours of computing power) ] / [ ( X hours of computing power needed for success) ]

While the above framework seems very simple, each component of the equation is individually very difficult. What is the long-term benefit of a solar cell being 10% more efficient? If we spent 1 million hours of computing, what is the likelihood that would result in an improved solar cell? And even then, do we actually have an estimate on how many hours it might take to get to a solution?",1,2,False,self,,,,,

1) Self driving cars will increase sprawl by allowing people to get things done while in transit, allow people who cant drive to be productive and give security to rural real estate.

2) Automation will bring about rapid change faster than our political structures will be able to cope with. If you have a new low cost technology and your biggest obstacle to fast execution is governing powers naturally places that require less coordinations of peoples will prosper. 

3) Living in rural will give job security in a cyclical way. Every village needs an idiot. If a persons job has become so simple an idiot can do it there will be downsizing. I.e. if youre in a city with 300 other lawyers you can expect that your job may be at risk. However if youre the only lawyer in town, the fact that computers do all the work doesnt change a thing. 

4) Due to automation based linkages, rural retail will have a huge advantage. Less competition while being able to competitively offer products that in the past could only be done in the cities. A major added bonus will be the fact that retail can be built swiftly at low rental rates. (i.e. picture shopping out of a tent). 

5) Lifestyles change, in a world where a smaller and smaller portion of your life is based on being at work, places that allow for more diverse and open lifestyles like hunting/farming/fishing/golfing are gonna have an advantage that cannot be easily countered.

6) While its expected that poverty may disappear income inequality will only be made worst not better by automation. In this situation there is a very real threat that densely populated areas might see increasing rates of violent crime. Making rural areas much more secure. Additionally it means being out reach of the municipal governments who may need to introduce radical measures out of necessity(constant servalence ) 

7) When being an employee gets tough, being a producer is far better. The economic structures of the near future may change however it seems likely that those who can invest their small amounts of money smartly will have a security that can't be beat. Most importantly as the value of labor decreases the value of raw resources should rise. Farming, owning solar, wind, cutting wood, building housing out of materials found on ones own property etc will make rural folk far less dependent on others.

8) If a UBI becomes the norm your purchasing power will be highest where there is less demand for goods and resources. Logically rural has an advantage. 

9) The economics of the future will require experimentation and a bit of role playing. The economics of the future will logically be less interested in increasing productivity and more interested in ensuring everyone is has something to do. While itd be fun to imaging this happening in Manhattan the reality is experimentation works best where there is minimal interference. 

10) The value of labor might get very low. There is a very real scenario where automation might truly drop people out of the economy while allowing others to live on mars. There is no reason to think our modern form of income equality will continue in the future. We have to remember that our sense of income inequality is directly connected to what we experience in cities. In the country side there is no such thing as a slum. Even in the poorest parts of the world if a person can afford enough land to farm, they are relatively well off. In the future we might have to get use to the idea that in Kentucky people live like its 1066 A.D. while people are living like its 3066 A.D. in San Francisco. What matters isnt some numerical value but if people can live healthy lives where they have potential for societal engagement. This isn't a small challenge but we might have to think differently about how we view currency.
