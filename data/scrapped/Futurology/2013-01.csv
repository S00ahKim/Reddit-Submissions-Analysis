* [15, Bloomberg Businessweek](http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-02-16/the-greatest-innovations-of-all-timebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice)
* [25, Foreign Policy Research Institute](http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/1325.200810.husick.stonetosilicon.html)
* [10, BCBusiness](http://www.bcbusinessonline.ca/bcb/tech-innovation/2010/04/02/history039s-greatest-innovations)

What are some other inventions you think belong in the ""greatest hits for humanity"" list?  I'd add Birth Control, and I'd certainly mention widely-accessible computing.

To stay relevant to the future; what are some in-development or upcoming advancements that you think have the potential to drastically impact human life, along the order of the Internet, computing, or others on these lists?

The biggest one on my radar these days is 3d Printing, but only if it becomes cheap enough to be widespread.

I'd like to start by saying that I came to this realization on my own. I'm not taking claim to anything and I'm hoping there is a body of research discussing the potential effects of this existance.    

If you're a TL;DR person, you can skip down to the bottom, (or comments if this ever gets any). Recently I was experiencing difficulty while attempting to solve a space issue experienced with online file-sharing.

I'll share my thoughts during the problem and solution to transition into how I considered this possibility.

&gt; Limited online space means that some of the people in my team must find ways to expand the space on their given accounts. **One way to do this is by creating a fake email address and password, and then connecting to the original account as a referral.**

This solution, while helping me immediately, has its long run implications. While most web servers probably have a deletion period for unused email addresses, what happens as the population expands or goes through the large scale shift to technological reliance. Assuming not all providers offer a 'deletion  period' how is technology to respond to an increase in the number of customers, with increasingly similar credentials.

One of the benefits of Physical documentation, and locality associated with the corresponding individual often meant that anomalies rarely occurred, even when individuals of the same name lived in proximity of each other.

Outpacing the widespread shift to technological reliance is its connectivity i.e. the absent attachment to locality associated with antiquated forms of documentation and record keeping.

I feel that in some ways we are racing towards a zero-sum definition of identity. 

To put it bluntly, with non-digital record keeping ""John Doe"" can exist in many different places, simultaneously. But when signing up for a google account there is only one ""john.doe@gmail.com""

**My primary concerns are here, also a good TL;DR spot:**

2. What differences exist or will emerge into the future to ensure that when more J. Doe's make use of online services, they do not clash with one another?

3. Is the shift to a username based environment (one that makes reference to something about the person rather than a readily identifiable naming convention) inevitable? Or is it largely user driven. 

4. Are there potential economic implications, regarding productivity and the precision delivery of essential services to individuals?

More Thoughts:

&gt; What if, for example, we have a seemingly mature and advance population, that say, isn't able to reach its true potential because of a ""lockout"" in identity i.e. too many individuals with the same or similar names receiving misinformation as a result of technological failure. 

&gt; Another major concern of mine is that too much fragmentation before hand, will cause a loss of overall productivity as well.

* What kind of impact does this have, for instance, on the Reddit Community and future Redditors who may wish to post meaningful things, but must choose from a limited number of usernames (that are not random word/number combinations).

*While I feel the shift to technological communication a good one, these are the things that keep me up at night (considering especially, I am one of those individuals with two 'first names'), if I may digress, My situation involves confirmation from any person working at the front desk, whether its school, the doctors office, or frequent name mix-ups. (making my last name my first name, in one instance, my highschool couldn't find my diploma because of this mistake)*

* I know this is a long post, and it asks quite a few questions, feel free to just use the number of the question you are answering, or answer them all!",9,2

____

(Official debate thread is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Debate/comments/15ypwe/the_collapse_and_futurology_debate/).)

It is the general position of Reddits /r/Futurology community that human history demonstrates a positive trend toward the beginning of planetary civilization, one that will be especially catalyzed by our current transition toward industrialization, machine intelligence, and post-scarcity. This attitude is widely regarded as techno-optimism and is backed by predictions from various industry-leaders and futurists. One such futurist, [Jason Silva](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/yl6it/i_am_jason_silva_filmmaker_media_artist_futurist/), provided Wired with a particularly tasteful definition of techno-optimism. Techno-optimism is a belief in the power of technology to extend our sphere of possibilities, and ultimately a belief that technology helps us solve and transcend problems, limitations and obstacles. Of course, thats a very basic statement. After all, the very nature of technology is that it solves problems. From the moment we picked up a stick and used it to reach a fruit on a really high tree as early Homo sapiens, weve been using our tools to extend our boundaries of who and what we are, [says Silva](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/01/jason-silva/), echoing a popular sentiment by renowned inventor Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil has compared the force of technology to that of evolution. Our ability to create virtual models in our heads combined with our modest looking thumbs was sufficient to usher in a secondary force of evolution called technology."" His insight that technology feeds on itself, growing exponentially, has led to his [wildly popularized](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ntY01qoIdus#!) prediction of a [technological Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). Today, thousands of futurists and industry leaders have contributed to this vision which has grown to represent the event horizon wherein emerging fields-- most notably biotechnology, robotics, and nanotechnology-- eclipse to create smarter-than-human technologies.


So, how did we come to this conclusion? Dont disease, war, famine, and debt easily overshadow techno-optimism? What about technology-driven collapse: climate crisis, nuclear war, even the popular gray-goo scenario of nanotechnology? After all, thats what we keep hearing about: ineffective government, mounting debt, rioting in the Middle East, political unrest-- the list goes on and on. Its a list /r/Collapse seems to embrace, forgetting the progress we, the human species, are continually making. Peter Diamandis, chair of the Singularity University, has not forgotten. In his book, *Abundance*, Diamandis makes [an almost incontrovertible case](http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_diamandis_abundance_is_our_future.html#149000) for techno-optimism. Over the last hundred years, he reminds us the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10. Add to that the cost of food, electricity, transportation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold. Steven Pinker [has showed us](http://fora.tv/2012/10/13/Steven_Pinker_A_History_of_Violence) that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history. And Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years. We truly are living in an extraordinary time. And many people forget this.


At /r/Futurology, we havent forgotten this. Were embracing it. Michio Kaku, famous theoretical physicist and author, hasnt forgotten either. In his latest book *Physics of the Future* Kaku attempts to determine what makes successful predictions of the future. The book begins with a case study, 1863 novelist Jules Verne. Two of Vernes books, Paris in the Twentieth Century and From the Earth to the Moon provide unprecedented foresight into the future, predicting technologies as varied as skyscrapers and elevators, and even a system resembling the Internet. Kaku determines that what ultimately drove Vernes shockingly accurate vision of the future was his realization that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles. Kaku calls this realization simply the power of science to revolutionize society. Finance, housing, medicine, infrastructure, even empathy- a condition vital to our civilizations success- are fundamentally shaped by science. Society runs on technology. And that technology is getting better.


Id like to leave you with just one thought. Its a realization-- paradigm-shift-- poetically penned by Robert Ardrey, behavioral scientists and writer. We were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides. And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles, and our irreconcilable regiments? Or our treaties whatever they may be worth; our symphonies however seldom they may be played; our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields; our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished. The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen. We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses.",13,48

We have lots of laws about the internet which didn't exist already. So what are some of the laws that will be changed in the future (both short and long term) because of changes in technology? 

Here are my candidates:

1) Genetic pollution laws. People who grow genetically modified organisms will have to ensure that the genetic material does not out compete existing natural wildlife, or risk fines under anti-pollution laws.

2) Genetic discrimination laws. The benefits to getting genetically tested for possible future illness is too valuable to have people living in fear about getting a test or not in case they can't get insurance etc. It will be illegal to discriminate based such tests.",43,22

I asked them the question if they would feel comfortable having a car like that and they had this disgusting look on their face questioning why would they trust a computer to drive a car. I explained to them that the car has hundreds of computers, senors, and cameras that take in ever piece of outside information and alters the car accordingly...They still stated that they wouldn't trust it...what if there was a glitch in the system, what if it started veering off on it's own...blah blah blah...I still stood firm on my argument that hundreds of senors has a better judgement then 2 eyes but with the car not being human they just don't like it.

Now not everyone is like this, i know tons of my friends that are in the tech field and they can wait until they hit the streets but there's still a big demographic that doesn't like a computer driving a car.

If alien life exists on different worlds (which to me seems highly likely given the size and scope of the universe) and given the extreme exponential growth of technology that the Singularity is supposed to usher in, wouldn't some other form of life have already reached their version of the Singularity and started to explore the universe? In other words shouldn't we have heard from someone else by now? Wouldn't some civilization in the Alpha Centauri system for example who had reached the Singularity a million years ago already be here? Is it something like Star Trek where they are just waiting for us to advance enough before they make themselves known? Have they maybe explored our solar system in the past and not found us interesting enough to stop by and talk? Is there a flaw in our thinking about the Singularity that would stop vast colonization of the stars? Is the vastness of pace really so great that even a hyper intelligent species with super advanced AI and other technologies can't even put a dent in it?

A lot of questions I know but I guess the point I'm getting at is that the Singularity (which seems to be an evolutionary step in any advanced civilization) should have created vast galactic empires of other intelligent alien species by now and you would think we would have noticed them.

I think there are a couple of future scenerio's possible where babies or infants cannot really be baby or child anymore. With vr/brain implant possibilities where we can instantly learn stuff...will babies be able to do this too? Some crazy thoughts:

* The virtual reality scenario. (An advanced VR, where all our our senses are connected and we can do virtually anything). In this scenario most people will probably live in VR. First of all it will be hard to have any children at all in this scenario (sexual intercourse in VR will probably not impregnate anyone ;P ). But if a child does get born then it will wake up in an 'dormant' world (matrix style but without the farming robots). Should we let the babies plug in as well? If they do plug in, are they baby-like or not? If they do not plug in how will we raise them (robots?)

* Brain implant scenario (Matrix ""I know kung fu"" style). In this scenerio most or the humans are superhuman. Our babies are not. However, we can probably implant knowledge in their minds too. But what will happen to someone (a baby) if that person is only 2 days old, can speak all the languages fluently, knows how to drive, cook, program, debate, kungfu, etc. This person still has a baby body and no memories older than 2 days...

* Singularity. Well, we don't know if babies get born the normal way but if they do they probably have to join the AI/superhuman beings to be able to participate in the society. What about their personalities, do they all have the same personality (AI like). In this scenerio it doesnt really make sense for the babies to get born the normal way at all. Will this be the end of giving birth at all?

Of course we can choose to let the children have a normal childhood. But a few questions still remain:
What is the 'age' where they can enhance themselves?
What's the point of raising them normally when they are able to turn superhuman, the instant they come of age.

As you can see there loads of questions. There are probably many more variables that will come into play but I think it's still interesting to discuss. What do you think?

But I'm sure it's been discussed before by futurists. This could apply to Earth or Mars:

Imagine human civilization living below the surface, efficient solar and wind power above, carbon nanotubes stabilize the large caverns that are carved out (possibly built by nanobots), shielding from cosmic radiation, water sucked in from oceans and desalinated for distribution, more land for animals and trees, artificial sun light, in vitro meat, more living space for an increasing population due to multiple layered cities, artificial sun/sky firmaments, availability to the surface for crops, recreation, research whatever, etc. I would like to hear any thoughts from people who are more creative or see another alternative. I have no credentials, just a recent hobby of mine to look at where science and technology are going. 

Also, I'm actually going into economics so if anyone has any advice on jobs in future studies for an economics major, I'd be interested. I have a lot to learn. Thanks for listening to my drivel lol.",1,0

This question stems from reading articles by people like Eliezer Yudkowsky to realize that getting self-improving AI working right (or in a beneficial way) on the first try is extremely important and difficult. Would it be possible to maintain growth by taking a bottom up approach to stall enough time until we could think about the implications more?

In a sense, would it be feasible to take small enough steps and focus on improving humans (using AI as a tool to improve our minds, etc.) rather than trying to jump into a self-improving ""stand alone"" AI without knowing what we're getting ourselves into?

\-

&gt;Life is a process of breaking down and using other matter, and if need be, other life. Therefore, life is aggression, and successful life is successful aggression. Life is the scum of matter, and people are the scum of life. There is nothing but matter, forces, space and time, which together make power. Nothing matters, except what matters to you. Might makes right, and power makes freedom. You are free to do whatever is in your power, and if you want to survive and thrive you had better do whatever is in your interests. If your interests conflict with those of others, let the others pit their power against yours, everyone for theirselves. If your interests coincide with those of others, let them work together with you, and against the rest. We are what we eat, and we eat everything.

&gt;All that you really value, and the goodness and truth and beauty of life, have their roots in this apparently barren soil.

1) What will operating systems be like in the future?
Will it be cross-platform as in, you run the operating system on a small device which can change modes (like the proposed Ubuntu Phone)

source:Canonical and videos from youtube

2)Will weak-artificial intelligence play a part in it? Will I have a computer helper to aid me in browsing the web or getting work done?
Shall I be able to ask: Could you cite this in 'foo' bibliography format for me? And the avatar I have chosen for my computer responds and states 'indeed sir!' and I get the citation nicely pasted at the bottom of the document I was writing.

source:multiple 

3)Will we ditch displays to actually using Occolus like virtual reality as our main place to compute, wearing some gloves and 

source:multiple

4)Will we each have a chip embedded in our heads, pill sized? That can interact with our brain? And give the illusion of a projected display in front of you?Let's say that this display can somehow react to a combination of your thoughts and feedback from neural pulses sent to your arms(if your arms touch that invisible display only you can see, it reacts like a touchscreen would today).

source: Old Man's War 2003


5)Will computers stay 'dumb' as they are today, and only hardware will increase while still offering multiple more ways of input (Leap Motion for example). 
A future where I can run thousands of programs concurrently and store hundreds of  exabytes of storage?  The mouse for example hasn't changed very much, nor has the idea of a keyboard - still the same although the design might have changed slightly, where are my touch displays that pop out and form a keyboard to type on?


So ,any other possible computing future's you can think of?
Or which one of the above's sounds more plausible?

I'm betting on #1 and I hope that #2 becomes a possibility.",2,5
188,2013-1-10,2013,1,10,8,16a206,"the reverse of age old trends, moving away from the cities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16a206/the_reverse_of_age_old_trends_moving_away_from/,The3rdWorld,1357774326,"I think we all agree that the world is undergoing some monumental shifts, however i think we're often too reticent to consider the possibilities of some of the more established rules changing, urbanization is one of these things which all too often is considered a permanent fixture in the lives of the next few generations however i think it's a trend we'll start to see swing within the next twenty years.  
  
I think this will be a fairly global thing, to describe some of process i predict being involved i'd like to start with China;  
  
In China they've a long tradition of filial piety (respect and service to older relatives, plus general good action), of dynasty and tradition - it doesn't sit well with the Chinese mind to upsticks and leave the land upon which ones ancestors are buried - however many are currently doing it in droves, they're leaving their backwater village life and going to factories, universities and anything they can find in the cites; and they're doing it because they're desperate to improve themselves, to learn about the world, simply to learn.  
  
Many of these people have had their hopes built up first by the overhang of the cultural revolution and then by the amazing promises of meritocracy and capitalism (remember the american dream anyone?) - as we all know all too well, these things don't pan out quiet so simply, and already masses of Chinese are becoming disillusioned and upset, literally millions of people are now too smart to enjoy the menial labour on offer or the low living standards which go with the low pay that's offered.  
  
I think a lot of Chinese are going to want to go home, back places as far flung as Xinjiang and Hunan - back to where their ancestors are buried, their families live and most importantly back to where they can live a decent life surrounded by good people.  
  
But they're not going to accept the old ways, i'm not suggesting they intend to go back to standing in a rice paddy beating a stick into the ground - these people are going to change the places they return to, they're going to demand good internet connectivity and decent transport links (china is already very dedicated to both these issues) 
  
But also they're going to have to transform the economy and structure of the places they return to, in general the stereotype is of very hard working chinese and this isn't in any way a false image -people that are highly educated and willing to 'suffer hardship' while creating a better life can be a very powerful force for change.  
  
As access to information is brought into distant villages and the returning people carry with them not just the knowledge of these new technologies but also the trends and customs of the cities it'll allow many areas to rapidly enter into the 'digital age'  
  
I think we'll see a rise in distance learning, distance working and distance shopping - already many jobs don't need to be done in the office and teleworking is becoming comming for everyone from journalists to telephone call centre staff -in the next twenty years even more jobs will be possible remotely, maybe even a lot of factory work and semi-routine tasks (i.e. clean room factories with humans performing tasks AI isn't yet capable of)  
  
However beside the diminished need corporate employers i think another important factor will drive people - space - living in a city the rent on a shoebox is excessive, out in the distant hills it's probably possible to buy somewhere for the same money.  This will mean that rather than relying on the traditional job-money-shop-food+consumables people will have the space to grow their own food, harvest their own electrical power or biofules, etc - and this will of course see a massive boom in consumer solutions, high-tech consumer solutions.  
  
From computer automated watering systems and autonomous bug killers to advanced goods delivery systems anything that makes living away from a city will be a boom industry - and as more people make the move and the path becomes ever better trodden it'll become ever easier for others to follow.  
  
I'd love to see the Chinese concept of [Ren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_(Confucianism)/) emerge into a truly powerful open source and collaborative movement in China, certainly i think it would suit both their national mindset and economic needs perfectly.  But regardless, this increase in the quality of rural living will be mirrored in many places around the world - certainly the Americas and middle asia, and to what extents it's possible in Europe.   This will bring the cost of localized-sufficiency down to the point it's an easy and safe option, hopefully allowing people the time and space to work on self-improvement (which leads to sharing of understanding, collaborative work and thus eventually a better world for all...)

Now if a cure for aging was found what would you do with people who had received this punishment? Here are the ideas I came up with that could be possible choices.

#1 Provide them with the treatment and release them either at the average age they would have died had the cure for aging not been discovered, say around 80, or the maximum age a person had ever lived to prior to the cure being found, currently 122.
#2 Deny them the treatment and have them serve their prison sentence until they die.
#3 Provide them with the treatment for aging, but still keep them locked up.

I'm curious what choice readers here would choose or if you have a better idea.

CES  2013 has ended, the annual expo included a product I predicted to my father back in the mid 1990's, a connected refrigerator. Unfortunately Samsung's refrigerator lacks a lot of functionality, but it is not really their fault. The problem lies in the packaging and curation of data by our food production and manufacturing  industry.

A few years ago I wrote about the future of nutrition. I predicted the rise of applications to take advantage of the ease of use of smart phones, growing wireless internet and the needs of dieters and health nuts to track their intake. I predicted the pitfalls that these applications would run into and that a solution would be difficult. Generally I enjoy making predictions and then watching them occur, in my main profession of Marketing Consulting it helps keep me sharp and at the bleeding edge, which in-turn helps my clients stay ahead.

Unfortunately the problems that keep automated ovens, refrigerators and microwaves from existing and that plague the mobile nutrition applications were left unresolved from 2006-2011. In 2011 I decided that I would work to solve these problems and spent much of 2011 and 2012 locked in my home office scribbling on white boards and visiting numerous grocery stores and restaurants and using several applications and websites. In late September of last year I revealed the first working iteration of a digital language for food called Nutritionmaps.org.

The concept is based on search engine technology and the structured data contained in a Sitemap, an XML file that helps search engines understand a website's structure. I realized this was the perfect way to allow applications to immediately know and understand the structure of the ingredients and other data for a food product.

Over the Summer of 2012 my colleague at Wasp Barcode Technologies, Grant Wickes, helped me solve the limitations of scanning technology and was instrumental in helping me understand better how current food scanning applications work which lead to the breakthrough to finalize the system.

The problems:

- A barcode can hold anywhere from 3 - 4,296 characters depending on what type of barcode is being used.

- food products and fresh food products use UPC codes as dictated by the FDA. Fresh foods use one type of UPC, packaged another type.

- Food products do not use codes with enough characters to effectively store the information of the data.

- The data for a food product and the UPC code are NOT publicly available in a corpus or database of any kind.

- Food applications must hand data enter food data.

- Restaurants do not provide UPC codes on their nutrition labels

- Food manufacturers frequently change the nutritional components of food based on changes in regional tastes, health concerns, legislation, availability of ingredients, etc..

- It is impractical for Food applications to maintain this data on an ongoing basis AND ensuring data integrity.

- There is no uniformity between food applications.

Nutritionmaps.org solves all of these problems and provides extensive benefits to the consumer. The system features:

- uniform QR code protocol (designed by Wasp Barcode Technologies)

- uniform language to display nutrition information, preservative information, ingredient contents, allergy information, lifestyle information (vegan, etc..), and manufacturing process information and to do so across Fresh Foods (farmers market), Deli prepared foods, Restaurant foods and Packaged Foods.

- uniform automatic microwave instructions w/ ability to use text to speech.

- uniform automatic stovetop and oven settings and instructions w/ ability of text to speech

- uniform automatic expiration information for refrigerators / freezers to power shopping lists, etc..

What I need help with:
I've built and tested the system under extreme hypothetical scenarios and not found fail points under the current structure. As a marketing consultant I have enough experience that tells me that something with this broad of coverage that involves thousands of companies I will need to use a pull strategy in order to get enough buzz to then get the FDA and other government group's attention.

I need help finding a willing and progressive manufacturing partner in both Food production and in either Refrigerator, Microwave or Oven manufacturing to produce and demonstrate the system at CES 2014 next year. I do not have contacts in any of those industries and I am hoping a fellow Futurologist might. Together we can speed up at least this one small part of the future.

Edit 2: Explaining how the system works.

Nutritonmaps.org is designed to shuttle the information from the food creators to the consumers, making the food creators liable for keeping the data updated, which in 95% of cases is currently something they must do anyways.

To achieve this goal the system uses a sophisticated approach modeled on Sitemaps and search engine crawling.

1. Each food manufacturer has a website.
2. Placed on this website are one or more Nutritionmaps.org XML files. They can be broken down by nation or region to help facilitate different variations of products and ingredients in different areas. (note: regions are not currently supported in this release, but will be in future versions)
3. The food manufacturer is required to submit the URL of each Nutritionmaps.org XML file to a centralized location (originally this will be on the website, eventually maintained by gov't entities such as the FDA)
4. Applications will then crawl and database the information from these files checking back periodically for data changes.
5. Information in the Nutritionmaps.org file is broken down by item id # and then further by the various components (nutrition values, ingredients, cooking instructions, creation and expiration dates, etc..). Because of this crawlers can database only the information they need allowing applications to optimize their database sizes and structures for speed and cost of crawling / storage.
6. Applications will access the information in the database by scanning a QR code on the product labeling.
7. The QR code will contain a URL string such as http://www.foodcorp.com/itemid=10000001
8. Applications will use the domain and item id to retrieve the stored information in the database.
9. Applications then use the data for their set purpose (sodium tracking, calorie intake, cooking instructions, shopping list creation, automated ordering, expiration notifications, automatic oven preheating, etc..)

notes: item id's must be unique to a product and batch due to expiration date needs. These can be alphanumeric. Since QR codes allow a little over 4,000 characters these can be fairly long, depending on the URL size.


Edit 3: Pull Strategy Explanation:
A pull strategy is when consumers demand a product thus pulling it through the channel. Also known as creating synthetic or non-natural demand for a previously non-existent or non-needed product: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93pull_strategy#Pull_strategy

The computer-controlled/automated house, a far shorter work week, most fundamental changes in day-to-day transportation (flying cars, vacuum tubes, etc), space travel for the general public, the end of war, and dramatic increases in lifespan haven't really happened.  Virtual reality (though the term is pass) is in a limited sense used for some forms of entertainment, but we do not normally do serious work in anything like a virtual world.  Alcohol has not gone away.  The videophone exists but has seen very, very little uptake relative to the telephone.  Esperanto and similar attempts to replace world language with synthetic language went nowhere.  Human populations did not hit maximums, and many resources that we had thought would be exhausted were not exhausted.  Multi-layer streets have not arisen, aside [from a few rare exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland_Bay_Bridge).  Human-level artificial general intelligence does not exist, and domestic robots are not wandering around the house helping out.  While clothing has certainly changed, I've yet to see very convincing specific predictions of clothing changes in the future that have panned out.

On the other hand, there have been some things that have significantly changed society that seem to have been less-commonly predicted.  The dramatic, globally-unprecedented shift in the roles of women is one; to me, this is one of the more-jarring things in older works writing about the future.  The eradication or near-eradication of some of the diseases that were mankind's greatest enemies.  The discovery and development of antibiotics.  The degree to which exercise has fallen off.  The Internet and electronic devices have dramatically changed how we work and play.  Data-gathering and -mining is quite important in many industries.

For example communication it moves especially fast. It's almost as if technology has an agenda and communication is paramount. Being that technology is an extension of evolution it must operate by the same principles. And it does seem to. Random mutation can be accounted for in experimentation. Communication is a primary goal of technology because it helps technology flourish and achieve its other goals by allowing the ideas to be up for peer review, to be spread, adapted and improved upon.

One thing seems certain if we acknowledge where our means of communication came from, where it is today and going tomorrow. We can project where it will be in the more distant future. We are essentially becoming a telepathic species. We already can communicate with someone from anywhere on the planet. Whenever we want. One day we will all have the capability of being connected by our minds in real-time, as many participants as we wish. At which point we will have a new medium of voice. It will be that of choosing which ideas to share, which emotions, which memories, visions, dreams? We will no longer be limited to communicating by means of sounds created by passing wind through various pieces of flesh. We will have a new platform for language. What will it be like. You could meet a person and with a wink... send them your contact information and a few songs and movies you might think they will like. This is the type of thing that normally happens after a few meetings. Happening in the blink of an eye. No more limitations of tactile computers.

When this happens too... EVERYONE in the world will have access to the internet and will be part of the global conversation. What problems will these people solve for themselves and how will WE apply that technology to improve OUR lives. We will be a collective, solving humanities grandest challenges. The Earth catapulted into a healing mode. Our intelligence will be so far beyond what it is today that we can't even fathom what we will solve and discern. I believe religion will be one of the first things we learn from. At this point I believe we will all learn the value of critical thinking and rationality. Not to mention at this point.. our COMPUTERS will aid our thinking making us all incredibly intelligent individually. Imagine the extent at which all of these factors will multiply each others effectiveness while weighing in on the global intelligence of our species? Exciting!

I suppose spoken language will slowly but largely become obsolete. Still used by those unable or unwilling to connect their minds for whatever reason. However, many may never learn it. I think we might use our spoken language within our minds for a time... passing words back and forth but with the new tools we will quickly find far better alternatives. English for example will become something similar to Sanskrit.And similarly... most other forms of language will still exist. But natural selection will allow for this new language to flourish far beyond what English ever did.

The creation of something like a Dyson structure infused with this would create a world of computational power the likes of which we can't even fathom today. The best part is the way Kurzweil predicts it, we could be looking at the first computronium within the next two centuries.

Money, of course, is a different matter entirely. Also, the legal issues of such an undertaking are far beyond my imagination. If you have any insight into these things, please feel free to share; one of the main reasons I am posting this is to hear your perspectives on this matter. Otherwise, I'm going to keep the discussion fairly basic due to my relative ignorance.

I was thinking that something along the lines of hydro-farms could be built floating on the ocean's surface. These farms could be as simple as a floating framework of netting upon which edible algae could grow in large amounts. I imagine a system could be devised in which fish could also be farmed in a series of floating non-watertight compartments. Obviously it would be most cost-effective to focus ocean-based agricultural efforts on seafood.

Seeing as humans hardly occupy any of our planet's water-mass, I was also considering the implications of ocean-based technology. If civilization could find a substantial niche upon the ocean, would it be a possible partial remedy for the growth in population and resource usage in the future? Edit: especially with rising sea levels around the world.

Edit:
Also as a hypothetical representation of my imagination (Beware, none of these ideas are substantiated by pure fact) I envision a future in which our maritime trade routes are bordered by a series of floating settlements, each not very large in size. These settlements could be dedicated to scientific research; perhaps the catalyst for their creation would be as research stations dedicated to research in oceanography/marine biology/ecology/environmental science etc. Obviously this is all abstract theory, but I believe such an arrangement would greatly contribute to globalization, especially if these settlements were legally/politically classified along the same lines as the International Space Station.

It be awesome to hear some of the stuff my fellow futurologists think about and discuss with. Also if you could link and quote somethings and give websites so i can have sources to write for the paper. Gimmie your craziest stuff!

What i think is that we are excelling at a rate so fast that most people don't even know its all going on. I believe that we are about to evolve into a something much bigger than us that outpaces what nature does to us in 1000s of years. We know have the power or vary soon to master nature and bend it to our will. I think very soon that we transform to biological life to artificial or start to see the beginnings of the transformation with enhancement chips or cyborg limbs. Sense the 1750s onwards our average weight and height was 145 5'6 now its 175 and 5'10. Our bod ysand life expectancies have rapidly increased. A new evolution is taking place and the frontier is the mind. I guess that in the not so distant future we expand the power of our brain power and add new feelings and complex thoughts that seem so far beyond this time. (I often thought that maybe alien species have drugs in their bodys like dmt acid mushrooms and maybe all they can get to be able to experience profound and abstract thoughts. I think humans think drugs are wrong because it destroys us we cant handle that kind of brain power the drugs give us but in the future we can add it to our dna to make it our body and our state of mind.)
     Technology is another form of our evolution. We are able to bring imagination and dreams to life with it and make it a reality.(Another theory i have is if no matter is created or destroyed then therefore our dreams and imagination must fall under the same principle. I'll explain. The things we make which are supposedly man made and brought up into existence from that point but really there not they've been there forever. Example, the internet is seined as something novel and unique but ants have been using internet algorithms for 1000s of years. So the more things we pull from our imagination is just nature something that has been their or will be there for if the universe is endless it is possible to say that all your dreams and imagination are true or can be true in a universe bigger and as limitless as it seems.)

The Drake Equation asks not ""do they exist"" but ""how many can we expect?"". And, quite rightly, we fear what they might be capable of. 

But the worst they might be capable of is a mistake. Human research into artificial intelligence has been slow, and from someone who's studied it I can promise you we are *very* concerned with ideas such as the [Paperclip Maximizer](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer) or the [Utility Monster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster), and even now we work toward the idea of a [Friendly AI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_AI).

There are (probably) so many alien races though, surely there are some that aren't so careful? I wonder how common it is for an alien race to create one of these terrifying entities, and subsequently be consumed by it? This would leave the AI to explode out into space, devouring entire planets in its ill-conceived hunger. And by the time it met another species, it would be so vast in size and power that it would be almost impossible to stop. 

The last point is perhaps the most terrifying part; because this AI consumes everything between it and us, the farther away it starts the more powerful it is when it reaches us. So if this scenario is less likely, it is necessarily more dangerous. 

Am I wrong to be really worried about this? Can anyone think of any mechanism in the universe that would naturally prevent or limit this?

**TL;DR:** I worry that even if we make no mistakes with AI, other civilizations might, and those rogue AIs now haunt the universe. ",318,459

Basically, what if at some point, infinitely far in the future, we've figured out the universe. Or at least, we can chemically formulate and compute our planet and history from the beginning. Essentially, this is a premise like the simulation argument (more on that below). Now, what if, given this knowledge, we were able to ""kill"" death, all the way from the beginning of human history - reform the minds of all those who had died, given our chemical/quantum knowledge, and place them in some ""afterlife"", maybe current society. This would probably be the noblest goal in all of science, and would effectively make it so death never even existed.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with Nick Bostrom's simulation argument. It basically states that given the following: humanity will eventually have the technology to create realistic simulations of the past, we will survive long enough to do so, and we will have an interest in doing so, it is infinitely more likely that we are in a simulation than in ""real"" reality (given that the simulated would also make simulations). Now, if we assume this argument for the whole ""killing death"" thing, maybe there is no death as it is. How likely is it that we're all going to wake up in the future? ",191,238

I know one concern of this group of people is that we create an AI that does not have our interests in mind.

So, what are our interests?  It seems that almost every human in the world now is interested in the safety and welfare of themselves and others.  

If you believe our race is headed towards some kind of ""transcendence"" where we can be fully represented by data, it seems as though our current needs and desires could be easily met.  So at this point do we follow the typical utilitarian logic and simulate as many people living as many different happy lives as possible?

I guess I'm just not sure what a ""friendly"" AI would actually do.  What are the interests of a species post-creation of a superhuman AI?

I heard that Lance said everyone dopes during training, but no one gets caught at the race, because everyone cleans up before the race.

I wrote a related essay some time ago, you can read it there: http://beyond-impossible.blogspot.ca/2012/02/atheism-death-and-afterlife.html
If you think this thing is too long and unclear, here is a shorter summary:

1. Human death is just a natural phenomena, like smallpox or cancer, it may become feasible to completely eliminate it some time in future.

2. However, bringing already dead people back to life appears impossible with current level of technology and science. But is there a way to make it possible, if we reach the highest technological and scientific level that can be achieved in our Universe? This is a ""yes/no"" question with a definite but unknown answer.

3. To answer the question we need to be both able and willing to get the answer. To become able to answer this we just need to do what we are doing now - keep on increasing our technological and scientific powers. This capabilities is approximately correlated with available space, time, mass,energy and information processing capacity, implying we might need to expand beyond the Earth and eventually Solar system, as well as the need to develop more and more advanced AIs. Thing are going pretty good in those areas, so I am not too worried about them.
 
4. The harder problem may turn out to be the willingness to answer our final question. For that to happen, our future descendants, be it super-intelligent biological beings or purely virtual AI constructs need to preserve the value of human life and tragedy of human death as the cornerstones of their culture.

5. Solution to this challenge would a universal system of beliefs, ethics and morals that can persist through all the technological and science advances for thousands or even millions of years, yet remain to be human-centered . 

6. This may sound like overambitious goal, but many of the world religions lasted through thousands of years with little change. However they are rapidly becoming obsolete in the face of present state of knowledge of nature and human origins.

Thinks of this as an engineering problem. How to design a civilization that will keep on expanding in the domains of space, time and knowledge, yet still cares about its long-deceased members and will try to bring them to life if this capability can be reached?   ",0,0

(Explanation of question in text box),https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16uyse/is_there_more_than_one_kind_of_singularity_to/,UltimatePhilosopher,1358569053,"Like, say, an information or knowledge Singularity that could lead to a cultural or political or economic Singularity? etc.  And would all of *those* Singularities converge together at some point to compound one another?  Since technology is just one aspect of people's lives, could it be only one of a number of Singularities to come?  I'm thinking of how all kinds of areas of people's lives could grow at an exponential rate, and all based on increased ability to store and retrieve information on whatever subjects of interest for people's lives.

In terms of my area of specialty, I'm thinking of such things as future technology aiding people in terms of their being able to quickly download right into their brains the contents of the whole philosophical tradition and dramatically enhance people's critical thinking and wisdom, which in turn dramatically enhances all other areas of life.  But I'm thinking of how it could happen likewise with all other fields of study, so that everyone ends up being literate in science, history, literature, etc.  How might that work do you think?  Could that process be ramped up before the downloading-into-brains technology comes along?  The internet is already doing a lot to bring streams of information and knowledge quickly and efficiently to the people without any special new hardware upgrades to our brains....

EDIT/P.S.: I can think of one major precondition for a political singularity, and that is the point at which all the governments of the world become democratic (not *if* this happens, but *when*, I think), since democracies basically never go to war against one another, or see their government slaughtering its own citizens in huge numbers.  That would effectively create the conditions for a real and lasting world peace, wouldn't it?  We'd be saving a ton of money on military budgets and whatnot, and that would be just one advantage to emerge out of that state, which would then compound on itself, etc.  Sounds pretty cool, huh? :-)",0,0

There just will be. The technology is just too important to limit, and we will eventually go the way of home printers and we will have the ability to print pretty much anything in our homes. 

How then, does a government or a populace regulate this? They've already built a working firearm with a 3d printer, and in the next decade, I don't doubt that technology will be available at Best Buy and OfficeMax. Even if we could program the printers to NOT print things like that, some enterprising hacker will jailbreak it, and post it online, and then everyone could do it. 

Also, The economy would change drastically. Need a set of plates for the kitchen? Don't go to BB&amp;B, print them! Need a bookshelf? print the pieces and assemble it! The program to do that is downloadable!

You simply get tired.

I was reading the [Memory Alpha article on how holodecks conceptually work](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Holodeck) and I was debating in my head the possible reasoning supporting the use of LCARS as the interface of choice for systems on Starfleet ships.

The concept I came up with was this: What if a personal holograph management device was a standard, and you ""trained"" it so that if you held your hands up next to each other, within your thumbs at a distance of 5 to 10 cm of each other, similar to if you were going to type on a keyboard.

This would be a gesture control that would initiate a hologram of a physically responsive keyboard, shaped ergonomically to user requirements, with force fields invisibly laid under the hands to support the wrists. A screen would appear just above the keyboard showing what you are wanting to type.

So you office workers out there, imagine if your desk was empty aside from the different ""desktops"" you load from your desk's hologram manager. Perhaps you have one desktop that has all of your preparation documentation for an upcoming meeting. Another desktop has all of your timecard management information. A third is an ongoing project of some kind. As you cycle through the desktops, the interactive components of your desktop, the holograms themselves, would disappear, be saved off to memory, and the next desktop would cycle into place, and the objects would appear as you left them scattered on your desk. Simulations of papers, pens, calculators, phones with project-specific phone numbers loaded into hotkeys on the phone, etc.

When you need to write, you write, when you want to type though, you just hold your hands up where ever you want, on the desk, or in the air, and the keyboard would appear, wrists properly supported, and a screen would be there ready to collect input.

Then you get up from your desk, and go get a drink of water from the water cooler. While there, you have an impromptu meeting with a coworker related to that project you were working on. As they're talking, you just hold your hands up in the appropriate ""gesture"", and the typing interface is ready to go. You start typing up your personal notes right there in front of yourself.

Just a bit of fantasy I figured would be interesting to some people here. I'd love to see some expansion on this fantasy. I've thought a lot about office aspects simply because this is where I'm currently fantasizing about this, but it would be neat to see what others thing this could do with day to day life outside of the workplace.",1,3

People create little virtual networks where their posts are special/privileged and only their friends can access the info.  Information is also closely linked to irl identity thereby limiting acceptable expression (sort of a cultural tax on novel opinions).  This leads to predictably awful and boring content of baby pictures and food, etc, but that's just a symptom.

I'm hardly the first to notice the similarities between AOL and FB, both are essentially redoubts for conservatism. It seems to me that FB is just the AOL of today. If the Internet opens the spigot and allows information to pour out, FB, and AOL before it, close the spigot and allow just a few drops through.

For those who do not know, in short, the Venus Project is a proposal for a resource-based society where everyone has what they need because of abundance. Several aspects of it are realistic and can be implemented either today or in the very near future. Other aspects are not only difficult to achieve but are themselves the biggest hurdles to implementing any new paradigm, especially in a peaceful, organized mannernamely, the existence of the status quo. Things stopping such a plan include lack of trust between nations, petty squabbling between said nations, high levels of materialism by citizens of most nations, fear of the new and/or different, etc.

In this discussion, I'd like for us to address those issues as well as any others that you may think of. For instance, the video on the Venus Project page mentions the fact that if anything at all is scarce, then the system breaks down. This has caused me to think about areas such as Formula 1 racing where scarcity can exist even in scenarios where money is not an issue. Furthermore, keeping with the car theme,  right now, many people would love to drive a Lamborghini or a Bugatti Veyron, to name a couple of higher end vehicles. Do we simply get rid of high end supercars? Consider that these vehicles are not as frivolous as they may seem on the surface. For instance, consider advancements in Formula 1 vehicles. These have eventually made their way onto mainstream vehicles. Case-in-point, Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) have transitioned from Formula cars to consumer electric vehicles, increasing their viability.  Similarly, aerodynamic demands for high-performing jets and supercars have also made it possible to design electric vehicles with desirable (or close to it) drag characteristics. 

These are they types of things I'd like for us to discuss. Note that we are not limited to cars.

Seen in the example above, is a gigantic structure that extends way up into the clouds, and is covered by metallic- or concrete-looking material, and a large areas are devoted to machinery, which may look pretty on the end result of an art piece, but are completely wrong and a lot of the times don't make sense.

If we're going to build structures that are a kilometer or two above ground, traveling to and from them will be the equivalent of traveling to a neighboring town today, these structures will most likely have everything that we need to survive, and that includes open green areas which we can use for leisure and regenerate our mental capacities.

Not only that we need open green spaces for our psyche, but we also need food and water to survive physically, and what better energy source will we find and/or tap into than our own lovely sun?

In this great paper [[PDF] Reducing Long-Term Catastrophic Risks from Artificial Intelligence](http://singularity.org/files/ReducingRisks.pdf) the Singularity Institute is explaining the concepts on how to reach the goal of creating safe/""friendly"" AI. However they are only explaining how one would go about creating such an AI *not how to stop others from not doing so*.  

If you don't know what ""Friendly"" AI is read up on it here (short): http://friendly-ai.com/faq.html#WhatIsFriendlyAI

Of course in the *near* future creating AI's will be a thing of (government-)controlled environments where it can be made sure that the guidelines for creating a safe AI are getting followed upon. And even all that is very critical as for example an AI ""arms race"" like what happened in the cold war between the US &amp; China could lead to neglecting safety measures for speed of creating more powerful AI (read below). And this is all assuming we get to know how exactly we can determine friendly AI (which the Singularity Institute is researching).

----

Now what happens if in a further future AI's go open source and everyone can modify and create own AI's ? Or if there are independent researchers creating AI ? With the internet it's close to impossible t[o](https://soundcloud.com/rdg/rdg-hedmuk-exclusive-mix) limit that. The implementation of this AI then also wouldn't be in need of any centralized &amp; controlled component with computation power rapidly increasing etc.

* Can you think of a way the outreach to open source AI to everyone's home can be realistically limited ? ""The government could restrict access to open source AI"" is not valid here as it's close to impossible to control the informationstream of the internet (~~life~~ information finds a way ;) nor limit the usage of what is available.

* Is there a way you could make sure if everyone can program own AI that the result will be friendly AI ?

* And if there are none what could the countermeasures be ?

-----

What may happen is a second cold war between US &amp; China and instead of the new technology of the 60's now with AI instead of the atomic bomb endangering our species.  
Then even after we surpassed this with everyone being able to program own AI earth could become a chessplate between 'unfriendly' AI and counter AI, we'd fight a war of intelligence greater than ours by bundling us collectively to defeat/understand/limit/.. problems created by intelligence greater than ours that we can't even analyze uncollectively (-&gt; which will lead to us having to address them indirectly by also creating intelligence in a way that it can tackle &amp; understand these things). (Also much like the virus vs security industry).  
Or just one AI could go very wrong. However this isn't like Skynet: AI isn't as in the movies, it's programmed and we (at least in the future in front of us) will understand *how* it works. I'm not speaking about AI that wants to directly eradicate the human species because it ranked the ""preservation of the planet"" above ""preserve human life"" or something alike.  
It rather may go for resources or *create a virus for defeating an illness but didn't have data to encounter some specific mutations of it that are deadly to humans*...

As written in our mission statement, *""the SENS Foundation works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to rejuvenation biotechnologies which comprehensively address the disabilities and diseases of aging.""*  Even more concisely, SENS  is about: ""transforming the way the world researches and treats age-related disease.""

The new SENS website, like the old one, can be found at www.SENS.org.  We hope to provide the public with comprehensive information on what we are doing, what has been done and what goals we have for the future. 

The website has a good deal of new content, including a couple of excellent new computer animations.  One is featured on the homepage, with the other on the new main research page, which will be at www.SENS.org/research. This section will also be the new home of the SENS Research Foundation's intramural and extramural research pages, which will give a lot of detail on each project that SENS Research Foundation is conducting or funding right now.

While a good deal of our support comes from scientific, corporate and educational entities, to say that public support of our cause is crucial would be an understatement.  Many people who have contributed and volunteered for SENS have no background in science, but their enthusiasm is key to help secure wider, mainstream support.  You can connect with us at our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/groups/4410586435/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts) and on our SENS sub-Reddit.  Also, please feel free to directly contact the SENS foundation using [this](http://sens.org/contact-us) link.  

While I am not involved with any research aspects of SENS, I would be happy to answer any questions you may have about it.  If I cannot answer a question, I will make sure to forward it to someone who can.  I would also like to take this opportunity to ask for volunteers to help out with SENS mission.  You **do not** have to have a background in science to help out (mine is in business and finance) and many effective volunteers have had no formal education in science save for what they learned in high school.  

Finally, I will be posting this on a few similar sub-reddits to this one, so I apologize if this is a re-post for you.

I am a volunteer for the SENS foundation. As written in our mission statement, *""the SENS Foundation works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to rejuvenation biotechnologies which comprehensively address the disabilities and diseases of aging.""* Even more concisely, **SENS is about: ""transforming the way the world researches and treats age-related disease.""**

The new SENS website, like the old one, can be found at www.SENS.org. We hope to provide the public with comprehensive information on what we are doing, what has been done and what goals we have for the future.

The website has a good deal of new content, including a couple of excellent new computer animations. One is featured on the homepage, with the other on the new main research page, which will be at www.SENS.org/research. This section will also be the new home of the SENS Research Foundation's intramural and extramural research pages, which will give a lot of detail on each project that SENS Research Foundation is conducting or funding right now.

While a good deal of our support comes from scientific, corporate and educational entities, to say that public support of our cause is crucial would be an understatement. Many people who have contributed and volunteered for SENS have no background in science, but their enthusiasm is key to help secure wider, mainstream support. You can connect with us at our Facebook page and on our SENS sub-Reddit. Also, please feel free to directly contact the SENS foundation using [this](http://sens.org/contact-us) link.

This isn't my channel, but I'm subscribed to this it and I thought I would share. There's a lot of great futuristic tunes on here that are *truly awesome* to listen to while browsing this subreddit and /r/futureporn. I'll list some of my favorites that I think you guys would like the most:

* [Stellardrone - Billions And Billions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveCENBgybQ)
* [Stellardrone - Eternity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-0H4HOATOM)
* [Axen - Somewhere Out In Space](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sva6Mgoa178&amp;list=UUZ8YN9u9H_tRTi2LTODoXLg&amp;index=4) (*Really* long but progresses over time!)
* [Sleepwalker - Growing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc1fORim2EA)
* [Stellardrone - Ascent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN3mTAHrp90)
* [Aythar - Trancesister](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOzeOO1jflQ&amp;list=UUZ8YN9u9H_tRTi2LTODoXLg&amp;index=9)
* [James Fox - Imagine That](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhU03W64HkM)

I've ordered them in terms of ""upbeatness"". The last two have very prominent beats, while the first 2 or 4 are very thoughtful.

It may be ""space ambient"" music, but the tracks on that channel compliment the material here and at /r/futureporn. I usually listen to them alone, but when you combine them with the pictures/articles here they really add to the depth of them!

So get out there and post what gets you excited about the future and vote on posts that you feel are equally exciting! 
Thank you for your consideration and post in the comments whatever you may be feeling regarding the quality of posts. 
Feel free to tell me what needs to change and maybe the other mods and I can make that happen. 

edit: As suggested by [/u/NeuroFuturist](http://www.reddit.com/user/NeuroFuturist):""Maybe we as a community need to focus more on pushing the movement forward. Perhaps send links that show people how they get involved in the push to a better future and motive them, like the 2045 Intiative link not just links on new technology that are currently being developed.""

We interviewed [SpeakMouthWords](http://www.reddit.com/user/SpeakMouthWords) who runs a viral YouTube channel that started [#nobodypayingattention](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7EA96FAEB79157ED) - The interview lasted a bit longer than expected so we didn't have time for the top 5 links.  I should also mention that this is unedited, and during a few lag spikes toward the end we sort of speak over each other.

The discussion covers everything from the Singularity to AI to the Venus Project.  We also talked a bit about the [debate](http://www.reddit.com/r/Debate/comments/1655va/the_futurology_and_collapse_debate_judgement_day/).  Props to [Entrarchy](http://www.reddit.com/user/Entrarchy) and [Bostoniaa](http://www.reddit.com/user/bostoniaa) for representing the community, and a thanks to [Xenophon1](http://www.reddit.com/user/Xenophon1) for setting it up.

Listen on [iTunes - might still be buffering](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-futurology-podcast/id570316992) or view on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BP9dd3n2Bo&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLaigPlClFFkNX2ad6E1wJUEBBisrLoD_i).

This would be in a lot of ways a much more reasonable way to control population then suggested in a lot of sci-fi, and probably even more humane then China's current policies.

I don't know how this would be achieved but it would have huge ramifications on society, of course, even if we were to just imagine a world in which the natural occurrence ratio of gay/straight were flipped.

We are going to discuss various philosophical questions and their implications that might arise in the future with advancements in knowledge and technology. I was hoping you kind people might help me, whilst hopefully immersing yourselves in some stimulating discourse.


Some questions that we are considering are:

Should robots with equal cognitive abilities as humans have equal moral rights?

What is a Utopia, can we function as humans in a Utopia and is a Utopian society stable ?

Do we need a body as well as a mind/brain?

Is Capitalism stable? What might replace it?


Of course these questions leak into all sorts of areas of interest such as neuroscience, psychology, evolutionary biology, politics, economics and AI. So I'd love to hear ideas, questions, predictions or anything related to the topic. Philosophy is a bit like the glue that holds all these disciplines together so I'd like to keep the discussion as open as possible especially as we're still in the early stages of brainstorming.


The deadline for submissions is 15th February, so of course I will share our essay for your own personal enjoyment and interests soon after that date. We aren't gaining financially from this, so I hope you don't mind if we borrow ideas for discussion, after all that's what ideas are for, right?

We made the following assumptions:
- World and technology is as it is now
- Suddenly, somehow energy becomes essentially free
- No changes in energy storage technology
He is an Agroecologist and I am an engineer. We concluded that it would change many things, most importantly food production and water desalination. Areas, like the northern parts of Europe and Russia are not prime real-estate for farming, due to being able to produce only one crop per year. With essentially free, or very low cost energy, hydroponics would suddenly become very attractive options.
For water desalination, the solution is pretty obvious: you can boil water and remove the salt, then cool the water again. Crude, but effective.
Also, prices of materials and products with high energy intensity in the manufacturing process would come down. This applies particularly to metal processing. A lot of now infeasibly impure deposits would become suddenly usable.
While some may think this would not affect transportation, due to no changes in energy storage, you would be wrong. If electrical energy would be suddenly near-free high energy-intensity processes to produce artificial biofuels would become feasible.

What else can you think of? Do you disagree with something I've proposed above? Why?

I will try to write a blog post based on your input (I will link this thread to credit you guys, of course) and my own thinking.",41,31

For a moment, I would like to contemplate what a true AI is. For the most part, what we define as intelligence goes beyond the simple acquisition or use of knowledge, it is the ability and desire to acquire knowledge, in a word curiosity. However, my pit bulls are curious, but only about things that affect them; how can they open the cupboard with their treats in them, where do I go when I leave in the morning, how can they wake me up to walk them? Humans, the only sentient species we are aware of, are curious not only about the mundane, but the extraordinary and 'supernatural' as well. Unlike animals, we don't simply accept the fact that the sun shines, we previously attributed this to various gods, but know we are constantly studying it through science. We don't take breathing for granted, we examine our need for it, and even try to test its limits. The things we observe through our sensory capacities intrigue us to the point of discovery of self, environment, and beyond. So, having set that difference, what then will we define a true AI as? Is a robot that we program to be curious truly curious, or is it simply following a set of instructions? Can a computer program truly become self-aware without any sensory input beyond what its user tells it of themself? Rather than just ask questions, I do have a supposition as to how we can test if it is possible for a robot to achieve true intelligence. If you were to take a baby that was taught only a language and how to feed itself, then lock it in a room with several different objects (choose your own, the objects themselves are rather unimportant to the larger point), he or she would experiment with each one and draw its own conclusions about each without any teaching from anyone else. The child would have sought out these objects without any provocation, and its conclusions would be based solely on what it observed. The child would likely form many incorrect postulations, but the fact that it would form any, free from anyone elses influence is proof of its intelligence. So, what about a robot? Could a robot, given sensory capacity and nothing else, be put in a room with the same objects of your imagination and draw conclusions from them without being prompted to? Would it even interact with them, without be programmed for such a task? Without that, I think AI remains just that, artificial, and we have no worry about robots taking over as the dominant sentient species, as they would never have a true sentience. How could it ever become creative without the ability to form a free thought? Why would it debate its subjection to us when our input is its only link to new ideas? I think we're safe from any robot revolution beyond what will take place industrially and economically, but I would certainly like to hear the opinions of others on this topic.",18,2

This is not possible, as man is not the master over technology, but rather, subject to it. It is technology that decides what happens, and we are there to follow its lead. I will explain why. This is going to be a pretty lengthy response, but it's necessary to explain the issue to you. I hope you don't mind that I will also share my response on Reddit, as it will take quite a lot of work.

**Seven trends that are inevitable without a collapse of civilization.**

We face a very significant situation as a species, which will lead to the complete abolition of our autonomy and the dignity of human beings.

Let us think of some of the greatest excesses and humiliations demanded of us by technology:

-Manipulation of the climate, 
-Migration of human beings to virtual reality,
-Genetic manipulation of human beings,
-Pharmaceutical augmentation of human personalities and moods,
-Cosmetic surgery of healthy human bodies,
-Government regulation of childbearing,
-Elimination of human privacy,

These are just seven examples that I can think of, but you may be capable of thinking of more examples yourself. I will explain to you why these seven trends are inevitable as a result of technological progress.

**Manipulation of the climate.** 

According to recent scientific research, it is becoming increasingly unlikely for humans to avoid 2 degrees Celsius of global warming. At a two degree temperature increase, self-reinforcing changes emerge in our climate that lead to a six degree increase. By staying below 2 degrees, we are believed to have a 67% chance of avoiding such a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism. [If our peak year of CO2 emissions will be 2015, we will require a maximum reduction rate of 5,3% per year. If we wait until 2020, we will require a maximum yearly reduction in CO2 emissions of 9,0%.](http://i.imgur.com/cGaZb3B.png) Both scenarios would be likely to have a massive impact on our economy and our way of life. In other words, it would require a technological miracle, or a collapse of civilization by 2020 to preserve our recent climatic conditions.

Far more likely is that mankind will try to adopt, by regulating temperature conditions on our planet ourselves. Wikipedia mentions that according to estimates by the Council on Foreign Relations, ""one kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide."" This is extremely dangerous, as the preservation of nature and conditions favourable to humans from that point onwards are in the hands of the technological system. If anything were to happen to human civilization, the victim would be our climate. Places that were habitable would rapidly rise in temperature, and hence the danger to our species would only increase. It is a far better idea to try to maintain *baseline conditions* that have proved themselves capable of maintaining a human presence on this Earth, than to depend on technology to turn an inhospitable Earth into a hospitable one.

This is one example where we can not restrain technology, but have to choose between killing it, or obeying its demands (control over our climate).

**Migration of human beings to virtual reality.**

As individuals, an increasing portion of our time will take place in a digital universe ruled by machines, as opposed to nature. It's increasingly clear that we'll live in a virtual universe as opposed to an authentic one. I consider this to be a very worrisome development, and difficult to avoid, as illustrated by the fact that we're currently communicating through computers. I would quite readily give up computers, if the result would not be isolation from my peers, who in turn also depend on computers to maintain contact with their peers.

[A recent British government report argued that:](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/9815389/Rise-of-social-networks-in-Britain-risks-fuelling-social-unrest.html) ""Within 10 years maintaining an online presence could become normalised to the point where refusing to participate in online media could appear unusual or even suspicious"". Hence, it's clear that we are rapidly reaching the point where a technology adapted by 90% of the population is *forced* on the other 10%.

The current generation of children will never be given a choice in the matter. In school they will be taught the skills that are essential for their lives as adults, which will mainly revolve around understanding the finer details of working with a computer. Maintaining contact with their peers will depend on video games and social media. As people continue to migrate around the planet, natural communities will be further disturbed, leading to increasing reliance on social media for families and friends to maintain contact with one another.

Computers will continue to provide increasingly superior quality of entertainment against which very little in the real world can compete. Consider the advances made in video games in a time span of perhaps 10 or 20 years, now consider where video games will be 10 or 20 years from now. An increasing number of people will simply drop out of the real world altogether, because the real world won't have anything to offer that computers do not have a superior version of.

Considering the advances made in computing power, and the legions of simpletons who take pride in being paid to teach computers every trick once reserved to man, it is becoming clear that in the coming decades computers will learn to be superior entertainers, conversation partners, workers, and, dare I say, lovers. The mediocrity of humans will prove itself incapable of competing with the excellence provided by computers, as computers have no issue with moulding themselves to our personalities and preferences. I'm not the first to say this of course. I recently read an article where a computer-expert proudly boasted that the Siri of the future will change its behaviour depending on your mood and personality, to accommodate your wishes better. With such advances in computer personalities, humans will have increasingly little need for their fellow humans.

**Genetic manipulation of human beings**

This is a point I have argued numerous times, and I wish to be very succinct about it this time. Genetic manipulation of humans has already begun, but we have started by merely filtering out our most unwanted traits, such as hereditary breast cancer. Of course we will continue with other traits, because as the worst traits of man are eliminated, current mild traits will be the new worst traits. As an example, in a world without Huntington's disease, a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease becomes the new Huntington's disease. Most people with Huntington's disease are kept secret by their family, because these are illnesses that run in the family. When Huntington's disease is eliminated, Alzheimer's will receive a similar treatment to Huntington's disease, until it is acceptable to eliminate this disease as well.

Similarly, personality disorders will be eliminated. Anxiety disorders, asocial and/or anti-social personality types, bipolar disorder, many of these are illnesses that help contribute to human uniqueness, but afflict the victims with suffering. These will be eliminated as well, and with every new disorder eliminated, the standard for perfection becomes more oppressive as opposed to less.

But what if Europe and the United States ban these procedures? This would certainly be very impressive, if we could eliminate all genetic manipulation in an entire continent. First of all, it will be clear that rich people will go to other countries for these treatments. Second, countries without genetic disorders, personality disorders, and even minor aesthetic defects will perform better economically speaking than our countries. How will we compete with the Chinese when their mental asylums contain 80% fewer people than ours, or if they have 50% fewer people on Prozac, or 30% less teenage girls with anorexia? How will we compete with them when they raise their average IQ by 10 points? If we want to remain competitive, we have to allow such procedures here too!

**Pharmaceutical augmentation of human personalities and moods**

Part of the method by which Prozac works is by changing people's personalities. People on Prozac become more extroverted, which leads to a greater quality of life in our type of society. In a more primitive tribally oriented society, an extroverted personality is not as important, but in ours, it helps increase your well-being, hence why personality tests show that people become more extroverted every generation. The growing use of medicines such as Prozac shows no sign of abating, as it helps keep people functioning. It may be possible to prevent a lot of pill-poppers through some interventions. As an example, we can eliminate genes that make people more vulnerable to personality disorders.

Assuming for a moment that all such ""dysfunctional"" personalities can be eliminated, what follows then, no dependence on pills? No, because we will be competing with those who do pop pills. If a pill emerges that eliminates the need to sleep, will we still have the option not to take it, if we want our children to succeed in school, if we want to hold on to our jobs, or if our government wants our economy to remain competitive? No, there will be no way to escape. Such a pill would at first only be used in the military and in highly competitive jobs, but it would not take long until its use becomes widespread throughout our society. Similarly, how does your teen become a doctor when your neighbour's teen uses Ritalin to focus on his homework? Do we give government to power to regulate and spy on all of our pill use, again, making us less competitive with the rest of the world, or do we recognize that we would be better off without these pills existing in the first place?

**Cosmetic surgery of healthy human bodies**

People who would normally not reproduce due to aesthetic defects now have cosmetic surgery which allows them to find mates. This results in their children inheriting the same traits, hence also requiring cosmetic surgery. This of course, is assuming that no genetic augmentation takes place. Similarly, our increasing ability to fix our appearance means that our standard for looking good becomes increasingly strict. Can we still let our children grow up without braces now that most teens have braces to fix their teeth? Similarly, are you confident that your children can accept the process of growing older, or will they grow up in a society where they feel pressured into delaying old age through Botox, Viagra and other augmentations? How would you suggest that we avoid this development?

**Government regulation of childbearing**

It is by now inevitable that government will decide how many children you can have and when. After all it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain our high numbers. [Jason Godesky explained why population growth is unlikely to stop:](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/Jason_Godesky__Thirty_Theses.html#toc5)

&gt;For every individual who decides to be responsible and only have 2.1 children, another will take advantage of the space that individual has opened by having seven. The variation in values, thought patterns, beliefs and feelings of social responsibility ensure that the fertility rates of a group will rise to the carrying capacity possible, regardless of the intelligent, responsible choices of others in the community.

**Elimination of human privacy**

It is increasingly important to spy on ordinary people, as ordinary human behaviour becomes increasingly damaging. As an example, Archaeology used to be the study of human waste, as humans simply dumped their broken tools and other waste products somewhere in the ground, allowing nature to recycle the elements back into the biosphere. Today, with aluminium cans and other polluting objects this is no longer a viable option. Hence, humans are fined for putting their garbage outside on the wrong moment of the day.

Similarly, it is becoming increasingly easy for individuals to destabilize societies. A man like Anders Breivik or Adam Lanza can tear a community apart and cause massive amounts of economic damage. That is not to speak of the powers individuals gain from bioterrorism. Similarly, supermarkets without cameras can not compete with supermarkets that do have cameras, as shoplifters will choose those where their privacy is *not* violated. Government will simply have no choice but to spy on every individual. The reason people go through such degrading procedures at the airport is likely because a cost-benefit analysis has been made, and the conclusion was reached that the benefits exceed the costs on the long term. After all, a single well aimed air-plane at a nuclear spent fuel pool is capable of making a country uninhabitable for decades. Hence we fall under the watchful eye of an increasingly paranoid Big Brother state, as its paranoia is sadly not without justification.

**Conclusion**

These are my seven examples to illustrate why I do not believe that we can put the technological genie on a leash. Humans can not control technology.

We are faced with two options, which are to obey technology and see where it ends (our replacement by computers), or to resist and destroy the abomination that endangers our dignity.

Think about the themes present there -- it's unambiguously a matter of conflict between authoritarian abuses enabled by technology, versus the small glimmers of hope of delivering more freedom to the average citizen.

More and more regularly I've come to doubt the faith I place in technology. While I see what it may yield, as in the case of a singularity or some prolonged life, I'm also cognizant of how it seems to dis-empower. It achieves this in a few ways

- Locking users into proprietary walled gardens and forming the nature of the service as a walled garden itself.
- Enabling a surveillance society.
- Creating a more volatile infrastructure which is dependent on an arms race to secure its operation, and its continued operation being necessary for utilizing its gains.
- The emergence of individual enclaves wherein someone could be anywhere in public conversing with the few they choose to.

And I'll leave the critique at that. I am sure some posters here can provide more creative examples.

It seems like so much is going to be achieved so fast technologically.... things that took millions of years for life to achieve in mere centuries.

It depicted the year 1960 with electric, self-driving cars and roadways with embedded circuitry to guide them.

69 years later GM re-embraced the concept, announcing they would start ""testing"" them by 2015.

71 years later Google, Audi, Nissan and Toyota had all began testing driverless cars. Audi sent one to the top of Pike's Peak at racecar speed with zero problems.

73 years later the state of California passed a law legalizing autonomous cars. 

But should Americans, neigh all world drivers, want self-driving cars? I have a few points in defense of this blossoming technology.

**In Defense of:**

1. Driving is largely an anti-social behavior. Ever have a conversation while driving? Try and recall that when you reach your destination. Due to the amount of focus on the task at hand, you likely pay little attention.

2. Current vehicles are built to warn humans. We give them massive, bulky red lights, which at night and in moderate to heavy traffic can upset many drivers. Have you ever been driving on a highway with lots of traffic, but still going at a decent speed, then crested a hill to see a sea of red lights? Your immediate reaction is to slow your speed, unsure of what's ahead, no matter if the speed of vehicles ahead actually slow down or not. In some personality types, and depending on current stress levels, potential for high anxiety, and if the driver is in a 'hurry' this can cause undue and unhealthy levels of stress leading to stress eating, abusive behavior, and abusive verbal comments. 

3. Speaking of anti-social behavior, we hate other drivers. Unless that driver lets you in line in front of them when a lane is closed, etc.. your feelings at best for other drivers is neutral and at worst is severe temporary hatred (road rage). Driverless cars would eliminate this entirely by orderly organizing traffic and flowing it automatically.

4. Cars and the cabs of trucks / semi's are designed to hold a seated human. More and more research is showing that being sedentary too much is actually causing adverse affects in the human body, which is designed to stand up right. As I write this I am at my newly ""built"" standing desk, and I must say it feels incredible compared to my ergonomic chair. Autonomous cars can be built to house a standing human, and not a seated one, greatly reducing the amount of material and the size of the vehicle on the roadway. Not that these would be the most popular cars (i.e. SmartCar) but it would be an option for a smaller, one person vehicle. 

5. Because the cars eliminate human error and would likely use cloud-based, crowd-sourced data on traffic, emergencies, wrecks, construction, etc.. we would likely see a DECLINE in accidents and auto related deaths.

6. Drinking and driving would be a thing of the past.

7. Teenager automotive deaths would cease to exist.

Like the first automotives, self-driving cars would create a fundamental shift in how our society does thing. Here are some predictions of what might happen if these vehicles reach ubiquity.

Predictions:


**Prediction 1: Political Shift**

Like many things these days, the pace of the self-driving car has been lighting fast recently. From laboratory testing to legalized in about 2 years is an incredible achievement. It doesn't take much of a genius to realize that by 2015 GM will likely have missed the boat yet again on a fundamental shift in the American auto experience, just like they did with Hybrids.

While there have yet to be many detractors popping up against the self-driving car, it's only a matter of time when lobbyist, pundits, and fear mongers start their dance with legislators and consumers. It is likely that we'll see support from Democratic officials diminish if the American automakers can't catch up. This will not be a successful tactic, but might hold up USDOT approval for a few years, giving Detroit time to get back in the game. Without getting too political, I see this coming because of the vast amounts of support the DNC gets from the AFL-CIO. That means the GOP will have a chance to make a play and re-position themselves as a party of technological advance, embracing the future. Whether or not they do it, is another story.



**Prediction 2: Death of Tower based radio stations.**

With the advent of color television Radio shows, which had been the large revenue generators for the stations, disappeared. Station owners discovered that they could focus on a genre of music to generate revenue and as tv's become a mainstay in American homes and the march towards 24/hr cable news reached it's peak, most show style radio programs died off. The drive to work and the drive home from work is now the 2 largest points of radio reach in the average American day.

In 2007 the iPhone ushered in an era that old school Internet Broadcasters (like myself) had hoped for, a way to short-circuit the tower industry's hold on the automotive listening time. Pandora's usage shot through the roof in the following years and Clear Channel, the largest tower radio corporation in American, responded in 2011 with a mobile app called ""I Heart Radio"" based on a website they launched in 2008. Now, their stations call themselves ""an iheartradio station"" in advertising and messaging.

It's clear to see that Tower radio is not exactly at the forefront as they spent large portions of the time in which mobile app based radio was gaining dominance pushing HD Radio losing more ground to Pandora, Slacker and Spotify. The late surge might be enough to get them marketshare, but it won't replace all of the audience share. Now imagine that you are not focused on driving and you can play video games, watch tv or surf the internet while commuting. Tower radio will suffer, but audio only broadcasts will live on, largely during work hours via mobile devices and online streaming, but likely not in the same quantities as now.


**Prediction 3: Commuter-time based live broadcasts**

TV Shows or even web-based casts or events like sports would be able to muscle in on the old Radio audience much like they did in the 1950's. You could see sports game scheduled right at the time employees are leaving work, giving them something to enjoy on the way home. Man new cars today are coming equipped with data access and computers, this is just the next logical step.

**Prediction 4: Auto-engaged, manual relief**

Ok, I have no idea how to title this. The idea is that many commuters might like to not have their car be driverless. It makes a lot of sense that many vehicles will come with manual over-ride.  However, in the name of safety and/or economics I see municipalities erecting wi-fi fencing and forcing driverless control of all vehicles entering a certain area. In Dallas morning traffic heading west from Fort Worth on 30 HWY (my commute) that would mean the moment the vehicle gets near downtown the driverless controls would kick-in and take the car the rest of the destination to maximize speed and efficiency of the drive.


**Prediction 5: Navigation only Rural areas**

Likewise, most of Rural America can't even get 4g mobile internet. Unless the driverless cars didn't require data access, it would be difficult to sell the cars / trucks in these areas.


**Prediction 6: Driverless Harvesting**

Speaking of Rural America, I am going to contradict myself for a moment. While I think originally there will be dead spots in the technology (if it's satellite / data based) eventually the technology will likely eliminate these constraints as adoption rates in urban centers increases. This will allow technology to be developed to improve the life of farmers, such as automated combines, hay bailing, etc.. by using online tools to define the field.


**Prediction 7: Death of Taxi services and Handicap Buses**

Ok I am being a tad bit dramatic, I am sure Taxi's will exist in some form, but not in the classic way we see them now. Perhaps mostly as driverless cabs to transport tourists. Small town cabs largely exist to transport the elderly and those without complete ability to drive without distraction (i.e. severe forms of Tourette Syndrome.) These would be replaced with either driverless versions or if the personal automated cars are cheap enough, with those.

**Prediction 8: Driverless Delivery**

Driverless cars have all kind of potential, and to companies like FedEx, USPS, UPS and DHL that can be seen as a reduction in human costs. Packages could be packed up at the warehouse and the automated delivery vehicle could pull up to a residence and drop it off, or wait for a signature if required. Mix this with an ASIMO robot that can carry packages or heck even a wheel mounted robot and humans can be taken out of the package delivery business.


**Prediction 9: Paid Restaurant Recommendations**

Let's say you just met an awesome girl and asked her out to dinner. She loves Greek food, but you've never tried it. Online reviews turn you off so instead you get into your driverless car, tell it to pick her up and to take you to a restaurant. The data provider for the driverless car could sell locality based delivery of people to eat there and base that on the number of people that are delivered. Using a combination of algorithms this could be done in an auction based environment to maximize revenue and would provide a trackable metric for 'foot traffic' that currently online advertising is unable to provide.

**Prediction 10: Solar Powered Highways become a reality, cars talk to the roads.**

Currently there's a crazy guy and his cohorts working [on a silly idea for solar power highways](http://www.solarroadways.com/main.html). Crazy, because well what does that have to do with my 1966 Mustang? Turns out, not a whole lot. But if over time a majority of cars /  ground human transportation units become driverless and electric/hybrid, well then we have a ton of use for solar powered highways. IF the first driverless car is sold in 2 years, I predict the first solar powered roadway to be built in an urban center in 5 years. However, it is doubtful that we'll see 14 lane super highways built out of this material criss-crossing the nation or Europe or well anywhere any time soon.",3,9

I haven't written a lot, and english isn't my first language, so I apologize for any quirks.

Magic, lost:

It was night. The skies were clouded and the air was freezing. There was a snowstorm, and millions of snowflakes crashed against the ground every second. It was so dark; you couldnt see your hand stretched out in front of you. The wind was deafening. It was a far cry from civilization. Left alone out here, you would soon die. It was wild.
If situated high up in the hills, you would see endless darkness, and a single light, moving over the fields of the valleys at a breathtaking speed. 

It was a machine, floating at a steady height, leaping seemingly effortlessly over the hills. It was silent. It gave only a quiet, humming sound. In the midst of the storm, it was impossible to pick up on. Without the dim headlight, scattered by the palette of snow, the machine wouldve been invisible. An apache in the wind, or a ghost in the cold night.

It was a vehicle. A one-person cocoon of glass and steel. It veered ever slightly to the left, and ever slightly back to the right, navigating the darkness with ever precise perfection, ever omniscient. Calculating. Predicting. Like a cradle, meticulously designed down to the merest micrometer  a million years of human evolution and consciousness condensed into one creation. One work of art, advanced beyond comprehension. 

It harbored a soul. Tucked safely and comfortably behind two inches of crystal clear windshield glass and another three feet of dashboard, he observed the outside. Infinite black, and the countless white snowflakes, illuminated by the one headlight. They flew at him, and then into the distance, far behind him, like stars of interstellar travel. He let himself be hypnotized by them. His thoughts carried away by them. They were the unknown and he was the explorer. He had sat this way for hours, and would many more. 

He was covered in darkness. The only lights inside the cockpit were the faded orange of the dashboard digits and meters and buttons. Screens depicting conditions, and logs flooded with superfluous information, unimportant to his existence. He did nothing. The vehicle knew everything. The tree it would dodge by three inches in 300 yards by veering a foot to the right. How the air pressure outside would affect speed, and how many centiliters of fuel would be lost if the engine was to compensate. How many deer were roaming in a five-mile radius, and how likely they were to cross the flight-path of the vehicle, based on the time of year and the mating cycles of the species. 
Another light was the dull glow of his cigar. 

He chewed it softly. He decided not to be thinking. It was pleasant. What should a man do with infinite resources and more time than he could ever hope to spend?

Left was the earth for those so rich and powerful, that with words, they could move worlds. When aging stops and wealth keeps accumulating by itself, from so many places, pockets and people that it travels through collections of cultures spanning over millions of worlds, before gathering in one destination, the person, undying, whom is created, is a god in comparison to the people he impacts.

The man in the cradle was such a man. He was incredibly old, but incredibly young. He did not claim to have seen it all. In his mind he understood that this was a difference emphasized by him only because compared to what he had experienced, it all was not farfetched. It  was beyond implied exaggeration. And when the experiences of the outside world are no longer novel, where does one turn but inward? The seed of Siddharta.

So he did. And he mastered it. Perfect, unquestionable control. And so his thoughts were governed like the processes of a machine. Thoughts about thoughts of thought. And emotional discipline. So he needed nothing. Desired nothing. Both because he had it all, and because he felt he didnt need it. And that is why he sat for hours, going with no destination. No though. No emotion. Hypnotized. 

He had been dead. He had been resurrected. There was nothing to death but lack of consciousness, and nothing to the universe but an ever expanding beach of differently shaped rocks. The existence of life was an unfathomably rare, happy accident of intergalactic proportions.

He owned palaces, each of which would make the maharajas of the old world look like beggars. Mountains of gold and handmade embellishments. He could walk through halls, miles wide. He could see the world without seeing a person. He had courtesans made to suit his whims. If he met kings, conquerors and clerics, they looked up to him. Current trends and celebrities did not impress or concern him, because he created them. He was an original. A man of the past. Not because he was no longer relevant, but because he had carried his power for so long that his existence had ascended to the common wisdom.

His name was a word of the universe, and surely many even doubted his existence, because his impact was so foundational that the impending shock could not be felt. Societies floated on his waves, and mistook his movements for their own. His ideas of the morning drove the world of the afternoon, and his power flowed and multiplied through the channels and funnels of the current top of society. 
None held a higher place than them. Yet, if they were the lead actors of the play, he was the stage.

Not many people inhabited the blue planet any longer. It was sealed off. Private to him and those like him. To others, they were gods, and to them, others were ants. Not from a perspective of worth, but from one of importance.

He was painfully aware that he was nothing but a human. A complicated, intelligent, chemical process. He was so versed in his own behavior, that it did not excite him anymore. He had met all extremes of people, and all in between. He understood them well, because whatever thought they had had, he had had twiceor thrice. He had been poor and rich and then poor again out of pure boredom, and he could read people backwards, forwards and inside-out. He could control them, but saw no purpose, seeing as they manipulated themselves according to his will.

It was all a game of validation, even to those who claimed to be above it. He didnt grow sick anymore. Only tired. He saw everything, not entirely unlike the machine that shuttled him safely through a snowstorm. Because of this, all those he spoke to, followed his every word. 

Few people stood outside this social game. Those who did, kept the blue planet to themselves. They all wielded power of the same magnitude. Who was more powerful did not matter, Sometimes they met. It was not a question of social game  they were all past that. Rather, it was a question of having your own consciousness reflected in the eyes of another conscious being. One who knew you. One who was what you were. Sometimes intense debates ensued. Most often, only a few words, and the feeling of 
shared experience.

With infinite resources, and more time than he could ever spend, what should a man do?

When knowledge is superfluous to the point where process doesnt excite. Where death is only sleep without dreams, and the state of life is the state which  a creature capable of such a process defaults back to. Where nirvana is only the act of awaiting a death that will never arrive. Where the only thing greater than you and your chosen few is a god that doesnt exist, except in the minds of those left behind. 

And so, there was nothing.
And so, he had time.
And so, he didnt have to think.

Oblivious to the world around him, and oblivious to the storm of electrical processes that guided him through the storm of cold, his mind was blank, and he saw only the stars of the infinite universe, glimmering in the headlight of the machine.

662,2013-1-28,2013,1,28,13,17erc0,Discussion: 20th Century Laws Fail to Account for 21st Century Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/17erc0/discussion_20th_century_laws_fail_to_account_for/,micahfk,1359346248,"This has been on my mind for a bit now and thought to hear other views on this beyond my own thinking. The quote I put forth stemmed from the recent push for [gun control](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-state-passes-toughest-gun-control-law-nation/story?id=18224091) in the US following the horrific shootings, but isn't limited to guns itself. I believe that the original philosophy of a slow government with checks and balances to avoid overreach may reach an inflection point with technology whereby the push for a new law becomes outdated by the time it gets passed or at least within a few years as our politicians continue to think at a 20th Century pace. Some examples:

**FAA and Electronic Devices**

Let's start with a simple one--how many of you have ignored the request to turn off your device or thought you turned it off (remember residual power means you have to take out the batteries to truly turn it off)? I think we can all agree that those running the FAA haven't ventured very far past their AOL accounts. The silliness of them not being able [to test or adjust](http://www.nbcnews.com/travel/travelkit/fcc-urges-faa-rethink-electronic-devices-planes-rule-1C7500898) for the slew of new gadgets continues to display how far behind the government is with the [speed of technological improvements](http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/01/17/yet-another-edition-of-you-were-warned/).

**Gun Control**

Laying aside the view of whether gun control itself has/has not helped in the past, I'm amazed at how antiquated it feels hearing gun control advocates push for the same kind of restrictions when technology is quickly progressing in making these laws outdated. The ability for the masses via [3d printing](http://www.businessinsider.com/3d-printers-and-high-capacity-magazine-bans-2013-1) to download specs and print your own gun brings a challenging issue for the country (and other countries course). Debates on Facebook (at least of my friends), the news, and our politicians completely miss this aspect; often when the point is raised and acknowledged the view is that something must be done [even if they agree it will not accomplish anything](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/01/19/ny-rep-israel-targets-3-d-printed-gun-magazines/). Others pause and go ""hrm... Hadn't thought of that"" without an idea of what to do then.

**Video-taping**

Certain [states prohibit the public video-taping of police](http://gizmodo.com/5900680/7-rules-for-recording-police) ([Illinois excepted](http://jonathanturley.org/2012/05/10/seventh-circuit-bars-use-of-illinois-law-to-prosecute-citizens-for-videotaping-police-and-slams-cook-county-states-attorney-alvarez-for-extreme-views/)) and specific government areas (indoors and outdoors) are prohibited as well. These limitations may or may have not served effectively in the 20th Century but it was easy to spot violations and take away the tapes. Today with [auto-uploading apps like the ACLU's](http://www.autoblog.com/2012/07/05/aclu-launches-phone-app-to-help-motorists-secretly-record-police/) and the upcoming Google Glass, the simplicity of mass taping without it being obvious and getting it passed those who would try to prevent it seems to make these laws antiquated. With the eventual ability to reduce the size of video taping into contact lenses, these laws will likely become pointless.

**Drones**

Drones are a fascinating piece of technology--and that's before one even touches upon swarm drones. While the US has been out in front in leveraging the technology for warfare, mass use has only started blossoming with quadcopters and aerial surveillance of property with the eventual [tie-in through GPS](http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/futureoftech/helicopter-parenting-dads-homemade-drone-follows-kid-bus-stop-1C7356195) and constant private monitoring (why pay for an expensive paparazzi when a drone can hover and follow more effectively?). Few laws currently limit what you can do with them privately--and even then capturing much less prohibiting how you build it will likely prove improbable. And yes, I am definitely all for the [tacocopter](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120327/04431918256/why-you-cant-have-tacocopter-drone-deliver-you-taco-lunch-today.shtml) even if it was based on a hoax.

In the end, I provide some of these examples for some thought-provoking discussion: Whether the government in a quest for legal limitations is near a point where it will fall behind the pace of technological advancement of the 21st Century.

Oh and for a fun jab: if your website looks worse than the federal government's you should feel ashamed.

I have two issues I'm hoping /r/Futurology can help me with.

!) In a nutshell, teleportation will work in a pad-to-pad or portal-to-portal way. I want to make the tech believable but not mega dense. What are the likely methods this could (perhaps fictionally) come about so soon.

2) Major events that could occur in the next 200 years. Some fun stuff like ""Yellowstone exploding"" or any pending energy crises/socio-geological changes. (Also, their probable solutions)

Because this is fiction, I'm kind of following an 80/20 split no more than 20% of my technology/occurences are actually likely *in my time-frame of 200 years*

Thanks for any assistance and/or creative ideas!

EDIT: Furthermore, I'd prefer to avoid dealing with the Singularity and immortal humans for this novel. A creative way to mention the Singularity and why it failed to occur would also be helpful.",24,5

If there's interest in something like this please comment below. Have ideas to make it better or to facilitate conversation? Comment!

We suppose that it is a function of a brain that has evolved to an amazing complexity. Which is to say nothing about the subjective experience of being an individual.

At most I am my thoughts, my most unique and original thoughts. And even so, my thoughts exist only in a inherited framework of language and preconceptions of not only what is but what I am.

I conclude; I am not an individual, I speak for everything and the ages and they speak through me.

--Everything

EDIT: If we assume that consciousness, ego and self-reflection are a function of a highly evolved brain, do there exist creatures who's nervous systems aren't capable of generating such constructions? I would certainly think so. 

And if so, are the aspects of individualism *real* or just another illusion of the complex interaction of neurons. We cannot (as yet) measure a consciousness in any physical way, what are it's boundaries, where and when does it start and it end? So what am I? ",41,10
