In a way, it was good: I got feedback, but also saw how vocal our subscribers are! 
Way to go! I know that feels like getting thanked for tea-bagging someone, and it leaves a funky taste in the mouth. Nonetheless, I will turn the other cheek and make some stylesheet fish out of your soggy loaves of posts. Because, let's face it, I'll soon be a god.

Sometimes they load too many thumbnail images at once, stutter while animating a page element, crash while connecting to a wireless network, load a file that doesn't exist, or muck up after a bad update. 

I'm not saying that it isn't possible to buy a device that doesn't run fast after stripping it from its packaging, but that after installing, updating, indexing, customizing, or basically using it, it runs nothing like before. 

I'm also not saying that getting excited over the newest Ivy Bridge cpu or 6 Gbps sad or Tegra SOC is wrong, just that none of those will ever make headway into solving the problem that will always exist: as hardware moves forward, software will move in lockstep, which will inevitably try at some point to push the limits of the hardware, slowing it down.",8,2

Things are great right now, but we know that the future of /r/futurology can always be better. To help kick the subreddit into next gear, we're officially announcing May as the month of future dialogue. What does this mean? Starting May 1st, we will have one discussion topic every three days. These discussions will be aimed at bringing people that are new to the concept of futurism up to speed, and deepening the conversation for those of us that have an understanding of the core concepts. We hope that this will not only lead to a series of excellent discussions, but increase the amount of dialogue and personal learning in the subreddit. Simultaneously, we are planning at the end of our May month of dialogue we are going to revamp the sidebar and collectively create an F.A.Q. based on the responses and dialogue we strike up during the month.

This will hopefully bring new members up to speed, as the sub can be disorienting on the first visit. Our two-pronged plan for the genesis of [/r/Futurology ](/r/Futurology is only the beginning, though.

To contribute, the best thing you can do is just talk. Comment on the official discussion threads over the course of the month, and reveal all the knowledge you have to give. However, if there are other discussions you wish to have, feel free to start your own topics. We want this to be a month where everyone learns a lot about the potential and the imperative of the future. In addition to this, if you see any posts in any other subreddits dealing with future tech, feel free to write up a comment and include a link to r/futurology. The mods are all very excited about this month and we hope it turns out well. Feel free to comment here with questions or suggestions about how the subreddit could be further improved.",4,10

I, along with plenty of folks on this planet, was under the guise that we were destined to failure though, and always felt crushed by the weight of our earths problems.

After reading ""Abundance"" by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler the fog of impending doom has been lifted. Now I look at the world in a totally new way, full of opportunities and places where I believe that I can reach up towards childhood dream and actually make a difference. I feel that a pivot in my professional life is in order for me to really make this happen. This is where I need you futurists!

I am a 23/yo with a background in technology. A bit of systems administration, but mostly digital media / online video - which doesn't seem like much to offer a company that is mining planets, engineering the next biofuel, or building solar energy solutions. I am stuck though, living in NYC takes a lot of time and effort just to ""keep the lights on"" and I feel a bit lost as to what my next steps should be. I would love to explore Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering, synthetic biology, AI, or any other field that is pushing the limits of humanity, but where do I start?

I have been looking into hackspaces like Genspace here in NYC, but I can't really afford any of the classes they offer. Where does one even begin to try to teach themselves aerospace engineering? What tools should I be exploring that are going to help me solve BIG problems? How can I limit the scope of my ambitions and put an actual plan together? My head is always in the clouds, I need some mentorship to bring me back down to earth. I feel ripe for the guidance I didn't have (or wasn't listening to) as a highschool/college student, but now I have ""real life"" breathing down my neck. How can I juggle this all and re-align with my ambitions?

If anyone in NYC would like to have coffee sometime - I could use a good conversation ;)

Thanks in advance reddit.

Thanks for all the great replies guys. It sounds like I just need to push myself to explore all of my interests further. I think I owe it to myself to get out of the house more, meet new people, and join new and interesting communities. It sounds like that should be obvious, but as someone who has spent most of hsi life behind a keyboard - it is a revelation.
